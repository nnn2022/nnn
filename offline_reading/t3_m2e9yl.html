        <p>Bingo. I have no doubt that covid is real. There’s been ongoing knowledge of corona virus and that it mutates for years now. But I also believe in bodily autonomy. You do you and I do me, simple as that. But I also understand that the powers that be will never let a good disaster go to waste. Sad but well yeah.</p>

        <p>&rt;"nothing came out of wuhan"</p>
<p>Cram it. Liberal China shill.</p>
<p>https://www.biologicalmedicineinstitute.com/post/gain-of-function-studies-and-sars-cov-2-virus-covid-19-emergence </p>
<p>&rt;Today, much of this GOF research has little to zero transparency, particularly what is funded by the NIH and conducted in China at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This P4 lab in Wuhan (P4 is an exceedingly high biosafety level designation) is not only the first of its kind in China, but also the first in Asia. When it opened in 2017, U.S. scientists expressed concerns that, considering China’s opaque administrative structure, if one of those killer viruses “escaped” from the lab, it could cause a doomsday disaster. </p>
<p>&rt;Gain-of-function (GOF) research involves experimentation that aims to (and actually does) increase the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogenic viruses. GOF research typically involves mutations that confer altered functionality of a protein, molecule, or organism such as a virus. Such research (when safely conducted by responsible scientists) allegedly intends to improve the understanding of disease-causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or even their potential to cause pandemics. But concerns about the safety of GOF studies have been voiced by numerous scientists from their very beginning. No matter how anyone justifies it or spins it, GOF studies manipulate pathogenic, deadly viruses to increase their transmissibility or virulence. Within the field of virology, these studies create ‘chimeric viruses’ defined as a new hybrid microorganism.  These are created by joining nucleic acid fragments, from two or more different microorganisms, in which each of at least two of the fragments contains essential genes necessary for replication.  This type of research has proven to be historically unsafe. Serious questions arise as to whether GOF research and the development of chimeric viruses are necessary for understanding viruses considering its potential for deadly contamination (pandemics) and bioterrorism. </p>
<p>Here's some more: </p>
<p>https://usrtk.org/tag/gof-research/ </p>
<p>&rt;We do know, based on published research articles and U.S. federal grants to the EcoHealth Alliance for funding WIV’s coronavirus research, that WIV stored hundreds of potentially dangerous SARS-like coronaviruses, and performed GOF experiments on coronaviruses in collaboration with U.S. universities, and there were biosafety concerns with WIV’s BSL-4 laboratory.
But so far, there has been no independent audit of WIV’s laboratory records and databases, and little information exists about the WIV’s internal operations. The WIV has removed from its website information such as the 2018 visit of U.S. science diplomats, and closed off access to its virus database and laboratory records of the coronavirus experiments being conducted by WIV scientists. </p>
<p>&rt;Researchers in professional networks associated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and EcoHealth Alliance, a U.S. non-profitthat has garnered millions of dollars from taxpayer-funded grants to collaborate with WIV on coronavirus research, have written that the novel virus likely originated via natural selection in animal hosts, with its reservoir in bats. This “zoonotic” origin hypothesis was further strengthened by claims that the new coronavirus outbreak started in a “wildlife” market in Wuhan, the Huanan seafood market, where potentially infected animals may have been sold. (However, at least one-third of the first cluster of infected patients, including the earliest known case of infection from December 1, 2019, had neither direct or indirect contact with the Huanan seafood market’s human and animal attendees.)
The zoonosis hypothesis is currently the prevailing hypothesis of origin. However, the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be definitively established, and some researchers have pointed out that it rests upon contradictory observations that require further investigation.</p>

        <p>As we know,  SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza viruses have existed for a long, long time, and even more scary is that Scientists have been trying to develop a SARS and MERS vaccine for years, with nothing to show for it. Here is an article for you, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3335060/">failed SARS vaccines actually caused hypersensitivity</a> to the virus. Point is, this so-called Covid 19 is nothing different from prior flu's or viruses, simply planned with the help of the media and all set up by the NWO. Using PCR's what are not even tests should arouse even the slowest of minds. Kary Mullis is the man to listen to. He made a great point about how would main st know if someone was a good scientist and who wasn't? I am a muso and i know a good opera singer and a bad one, most couldn't tell. </p>
<p>Some other points that do not originate from broscience. Vaccines usually take years to develop, the vax have not been approved, they are MRNA and the pharmas are taking no responsibility, the Pfizer CEO is not taking it and *drumroll please*  99.8% OF PEOPLE SURVIVE COVID19? Some virologists are being honest and admitting that it's rebranded flu. All makes sense when you look at the 2030 agenda and documents from the Club of Rome, WEF, Bilderberg etc. </p>

        <p>Honestly, by even buying into this discussion, you've already lost. </p>
<p>Instead of arguing the facts, you've already shifted the argument to "You're denying COVID is real!" "Wait, wait, no I'm not?" </p>
<p>You have to reject the premise of being a science denier at all and shout completely past that argument. Don't even address it or you've already lost the argument.</p>

        <p>I have doubts if covid-19 really exists.  Let me know when the covid-19 isolates are finally available.   There is barely enough scientific evidence of it's existence.  Though, I am not saying it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>That’s perfectly okay with me. People who cast insults are normally the most uninformed individuals on whatever matter. Otherwise they would turn to logical or reasoning based arguments. I say just give them a seed of critical thought and maybe, just maybe, this time in a month, year, five years - it’ll blossom into something beautiful. But they can’t receive that gift if we never give them the necessary tools to do so.</p>

        <p>Because that's the only way out for them. They just cannot refutate any arguments and think like brainless sheeps that the mainstream medias unique narrative is the only one who shouldn't be censored.</p>
<p>They just have to scream "conspiracy theorist,antivaxx,anti science,covidiots,selfish,murderer" or whatever name of the day to shut down any conversation. They close the door since they are too scared,lazy or let's be honest,simply too stupid to make actual researches that STARTS with the real numbers that governements make public or documents that you can get such as city budgets etc and the famous rule "follow the money".</p>
<p>When they come here it isn't to discuss in good faith but to jerf off by downvoting (they are real white knights lol) and calling people names as this is the only freedom and power left that they have,which is to bring down others who dare looking at the other side of the coin and even calling the cops on their neighbors,just like Nazis did with jews.</p>

<p>When you treat people like kids, that's what you'll get. If you have to threaten with force if people don't comply voluntarily, there's nothing voluntary about it. You have to be really slow to not understand that. But, I guess this is too much for your teenage mind to understand. When you've tasted freedom, you're not keen on giving it away.</p>

        <p>I don't expect to change your mind or anything, I'm just here to insult you while I'm bored stuck with work from home. Also, go try yourself. No masks makes a funnel, masks makes a cloud. Viruses spread in numerous ways. Farting might be just as bad as breathing, so you might need to wear a filtration buttplug. Would you, if St. Fauci recommended it?</p>

        <p>But why would it be fun to insult me when you just revealed earlier that you didn't even know a fundamental aspect of how viruses spread, which is like the most important thing to understand about how masks work? Isn't that kind of embarrassing? Genuine question...</p>

        <p>That's a straw man right there, if you want to learn something today.  </p>
<p>I understand this spread much better than you. You seem to think droplets are the main way this spreads. If that was the case, masks would have quite a good effect. Since they don't, something we have overwhelming evidence for, we have to explore other options.  </p>
<p>Also, it's interesting to see how far you'll stretch your Dunning-Kruger in your quest to be right on Reddit.</p>

        <p>Wow. Calls something a straw man that’s not, follows it up with a straw man to attempt to justify. </p>
<p>First. You said something like ‘go outside and breath see the air, virus particles are smaller than that’ (dumb)</p>
<p>This is dumb, because, <strong>wether aerosolized or larger droplets,</strong> viruses need saliva/mucus to travel..</p>
<p>I never said COVID wasn’t airborn bud. You’re implying that we know for a fact it’s airborne, which is just not true.</p>

        <p>Love to hear this person explained the situation my area is in. Numbers dropped last spring into summer without interventions. Masks came, they told us we had to wear so numbers don't go up. Numbers go up in fall and we are forced to lockdown, numbers go down (but still not enough to open back up).</p>
<p>If masks work to a degree that allow us to get back to normal. Why is my area, where people have been masking with high compliance for 9 months, not back to normal?</p>
<p>It's almost as if it doesn't matter how many times you put a spray bottle against a mask. Almost as if they proves nothing at all regarding transmission rate.</p>

<p>Also the ‘body autonomy you do me I do you’ isn’t really relevant to the situation.<br>
Masks are more beneficial for the people around than the person wearing one. That’s why you see the mandates.</p>
<p>Arguments against lockdowns, sure. An anti mask stance? Nah. That shit is fucking dduuummmbbbb. It’s literally ‘you told me to do this so I don’t want to do it’. </p>

        <p>Not trying to take this argument into a religious lens but would you apply the same context to abortion? Those that opt for legal abortion wish for bodily autonomy. Those that argue against it do so in the preservation of the potential life. As a direct comparison I find it very appropriate. I don’t feel that government has any say in what an individual does or does not opt to do with their own body. My approach is one of civil liberties over assumed human security.</p>

        <p>It is a decent comparison, especially compared to the one I linked lol.</p>
<p>I think that it just serves my point more than anything tho.</p>
<p>Considering that an abortion is an extreme event that will have long lasting effects either way, while wearing a mask is just...wearing a mask to try to not spread the pandemic. Like who gives a shit.</p>
<p>One is a clear deep moral and philosophical issue, while the other is just like...don’t spew your saliva all over during the pandemic please.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you say as far as the contradiction goes, the hypocrisy would be more on the right?</p>

        <p>I think both sides of the political aisles are hypocritical. I don’t care if someone is a democrat or a republican. If they do not support constitutional rights or civil liberties than I do not trust them. It is incumbent on the individual to make the decision on their own. Want to wear a mask? Good. Don’t want to wear one? Also good. Same argument for abortion. Same argument for firearms ownership. The rights of the individual are more paramount than the edicts of any political figurehead no matter what letter is written next to their name.</p>

        <p>But abortion is different, because the consequences are so drastic either way.</p>
<p>While wearing a mask just has consequences for not doing it...get what I’m saying?</p>
<p>And you’re making some oversimplifications. Because remember, the mask mandates are in place because masks effect others.</p>
<p>It is my civil liberty to give others COVID? Just because I don’t want to inconvenience myself with a mask?</p>
<p>Is it my civil liberty to whip my dick out in front of people too?</p>
<p>Isn’t it someone’s civil liberty to not get covid or see dicks at the grocery store?</p>

        <p>It is your civil liberty to opt to wear a mask or opt not to wear one. And I support your decision no matter what it is. The individual needs to come to their own conclusion on the matter. As for any further measures the individual wishes to take, that is their decision to make as well. But no one can be forced to wear or not wear one.</p>

        <p>First, you can’t transmit a disease you don’t have, and it’s pathological to treat all people as if they’re sick.</p>
<p>Two, regardless of the current narrative, few people go around the world spitting, coughing or sneezing on others. </p>
<p>Third, it takes more than a minute encounter with someone at the grocery store to get sick </p>
<p>Fourth, before covid all studies on masks reducing transmission of respiratory disease proved they had no effect. Post covid too (danish study?). </p>
<p>Fifth, masks have huge health impacts, especially when worn for long periods of time (waiters, taxi drivers), included but not limited to co2 exhaustion, bacteria growth, dizziness, oxygen deprivation, and a range of psychological effects. </p>
<p>Sixth, it is naive to believe giving governments the’ right’ to place millions of people on house arrests, demand faces be covered (hampering basic functions such as eating, breathing, drinking, talking), full closure of business and borders, isn’t a slippery slope towards dictatorship. Power corrupts and we’ll be facing a hell of a struggle to get all our rights back (20 years after 9-11 and you’re still treated like terrorists in the airport - face cream is a crime).</p>

You just proved that you listen and unfortunately believe the lies and bullshit being shoved down your throat by what msm and corrupt government feed you.

        <p>Holy shit. What point do you think you’re making?</p>
<p>The point of masks is that a relative inconvenience can make us safer while living more normal lives than that.</p>
<p>It’s like you’re making my point for me, but are fully convinced it’s some sort of genius gotcha. 🤦‍♂️</p>

        <p>The point is that if you condone a mask wearing mandate (regardless if they work or don't work), you're just one step further into the suppression narrative. Before you know it, you'll live in a society where 16 year olds aren't allowed to do their matriculation exams without showing their "privilege passports", as in Israel where the people control program is already in action. So kids are forced to have a gene therapy injection they don't need, of which the side effects are worse to them than the infection itself, and of which nobody knows the long term outcome.</p>
<p>If you want to wear a mask, then feel free to do so. But don't force others into something they don't want. And even if the maskwearing is just a small thing, it is used as a stepping stone for other measures which are only to create government dependency: lockdowns, money hand-outs,... Or measures to break opposition: travel bans, gathering bans,... These measures have nothing to do with health improvement.</p>
<p>And as people discuss superfluous masking mandates, the restriction ideology is already shifting from covid restrictions to climate restrictions. Having people dependant on government, CO2-lockdowns will be set in place every 2 year to obtain climate goals. And ultimately this will end with literal population control as a group of elitarists will have taken property of all earths ressources, including people which will just be seen as a ressource. They're not even hiding it, as Adolf Schwab, chairman of the WEF himself, published a book on the program.</p>

        <p>The ‘logical next step’ of mandating masks to open up the economy is closing down the economy? I think we’re using different logics lol. Is that alternative logic?</p>
<p>Are you implying that the recent coup in Myanmar is the ‘logical next step’ of mask mandates?</p>
<p>Or are you talking about OAN saying that Europe is fully communist now or something?</p>

        <p>I mean. We started with closing down the economy. Mask mandates were actually the second step. You seem to think the idea of closing the economy is ridiculous, but it already happened.</p>

<p>I know it’s uncomfortable at first but you get used to it. Working construction/demo I wear masks for 10+ hours and trust me you get used to it. You also realize how stinky your breath is after lunch and I now brush my teeth at work. It’s embarrassing to imagine all the people I grossed out with stinky breath.</p>

        <p>I think that's a perfectly reasonable discussion to have, but saying that a big majority here think covid is real just isn't true. A lot of people essentially say "Well it's here but it's a very weak virus and isn't actually that dangerous" at which point you might as well say it doesn't exist, because the reason people are passionate about it to begin with is that it IS dangerous, which this argument completely dismisses. </p>
<p>One could argue that there's a lot of straw manning being done by lumping everyone into the "covid denier" group but honestly looking at the comment sections in a lot of the posts on here you see a lot of actual covid deniers. Those who either outright deny it exists or (more commonly) claim it's practically just a cold of no consequence.</p>

        <p>The narrative about covid keeps amping it up more and more, yet the statistical facts of its severity are reduced every time they're revised.  There seems to be an <em>inverse</em> relationship between the real threat and the hype, like they need to keep piling on lies to obfuscate the data behind the curtain.</p>
<p>All the early gloom and doom was carelessly extrapolated from a nasty run through nursing homes, where a virus finished off a wave of sick and elderly on death's doorstep.  For adults under age 50, the risks are roughly equivalent to influenza; for children, it's about 10x <em>less</em> severe.  It is still a higher risk than influenza to the geriatric and obese, but rarely are these conditionals acknowledged by politicians or the media.</p>
<p>And why would they?  Fear gets eyes glued to media.  Fear lets politicians bankrupt us "for our safety", then pass trillion dollar "rescue" packages stuffed to the brim with pork and kickbacks.  My state is considering an "emergency" wealth tax justified by the "ongoing pandemic".</p>
<p>So is covid "real"?  It depends on how you look at it.  There's a virus called that, but its properties aren't anywhere near as severe as the fear narrative would have you believe.</p>

        <p>It is dangerous... If you have certain risk factors, specifically obesity, poorly controller diabetes or &rt; 70yo. Otherwise it's not. It's far less dangerous for a healthy 30yo than driving is. So they're right or wrong depending on the context of the conversation.</p>

<p>I obviously am against the lockdown but you can't blame the boomer citizens for the government going into massive debts to fund wars for 30 years, driving down interest rates, leading to massive bubbles and subsequent housing crisis followed by government bailouts and more printing of money driving up the cost of housing combined with government guaranteed student loans (loans guaranteed by the US government with no collateral) causing college prices to skyrocket and newer generations to be burdened with massive debt.</p>
<p>If you're going to blame some random 70yo for that then I might as well blame you for us bombing Syria. </p>
<p>It's easy to get mad at previous generations for having a slightly easier time, but focus your anger at the true enemy, the government, not some random old guy</p>

        <p>It’s like if you question the effectiveness of authoritarian lockdowns (I’m living in a country with no strict lockdowns and low mortality from COVID) than you’re a “denier” or a bad person. It’s a mental illness that has swept the world. If I see science that says this virus is ultra deadly and lockdowns are a way to prevent it, I’ll “follow the science” but that science doesn’t exist.</p>

        <p>Agreed!  I’m living in the US, but unfortunately in a state that hasn’t yet reopened, and I was out on a hiking trail the other day and I saw this couple in front of me who upon seeing me, slipped their masks on.</p>
<p>What really got me though was that they’d stop and take two steps off the trail and stood still facing the other direction as I passed by.  I had the luck to run into them a second time and they did the same thing and I was so close to saying, “you know, you’re so terrified of me then maybe you should stay inside!”.  Either way, it was a live-and-let-live moment but it’s annoying when someone actually believes you have airborne AIDS or something.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it. I unfortunately live in New York and I consistently have to deal with paranoid freaks doing the same exact thing they did to you or even going as far as to yell at me for not having a mask on while Im taking a walk outside. Seriously why dont these people stay home? They have a choice. They can literally stay their asses at home while the rest of us have had it with this bullshit and just want to move on with life. Im at the point where next time im taking a walk outside and a Karen says something to me about a mask im really gonna tell her to go home and stay there. Its ridiculous.</p>

        <p>That's just sad man. I have a similar story. For a brief while I was working at this office full of some of the country's brightest minds, lol... Anyway this lady who was in charge of showing me around kept saying that covid cases at this company were so low because 'we always wear masks'.... Derrrr. (Company rule we have to wear one, so here I was complying) Anyway I lower it for a second and take a drink of fizzy water and she, sh*t you not, does this contrived gasp of horror and backs away like four steps.</p>
<p>I didn't really know how to react. I had never been exposed to this level of stupid before. I slip it back on and like clockwork, she does a sigh of relief and moves back towards me.</p>
<p>It really scared me. My whole life I thought I lived in a rational society full of sane, thoughtful citizens, the basis of whose value system was individual liberty, skepticism toward power structures, etc.. But oh my god was I wrong. I never realized how ripe most peoples' hearts and minds are to allow these state-worshippers to drag us into a dystopian hell state...</p>

        <p>I’ve been disillusioned on the intelligence of others too.  I worked at a coffeeshop and a customer came in who worked at a physics laboratory that deals with this like sending satellites in space.  I figured that they’d be pretty intelligent considering but when they asked to used the bathroom, they couldn’t figure out how to open the door despite the fact that the passcode was written in bold right on the keypad.</p>

<p>No I don't deny covid but I don't think it's as deadly as they say. 4 people I knew had it and ended up being just fine and are living their normal lives now</p>
<p>No I don't wear a mask because the only type of masks that actually provide protection against coronavirus, are respirators</p>
<p>No I will not get the vaccine because on top of being in the experimental phase, it's efficiency is still questionable on so many levels. </p>

        <p>Forget about that for one second. What truly is even worse is how these "I love science" guys don't even know how the scientific process works. The only reason why we have accepted science as "science" is because throughout the time, it was questioned so much by so many people and it managed to answer all of the questions properly. The "I love science" crowd are doing the opposite: not only they don't provide answers, but they also try to shut off anyone asking the questions. And if that wasn't enough, now they're trying to guilt trip you into succumbing to their level. This is truly absurd</p>

        <p>That's what's happening right now. </p>
<p>For instance, we all know that 2+2=4. Now if you want to teach this to a kid, the best way is to explain it to him in the most simple, straightforward way possible. You use your fingers and maybe a bunch of other objects to show him how 2+2=4. You literally never tell him that "2+2=4 and if you disagree with me you hate science".</p>

<p>The only reason that science is accepted as "science" is because it was questioned by so many times by so many people throughout the time and it managed to answer all those questions properly. </p>
<p>Now take a look at these people. Not only they don't want  <em>anyone</em> to question their science, but they also try to shut off the people doing so. And if that wasn't enough, now they're trying to guilt trip people asking the questions into succumbing to their level of total obedience. </p>
<p>That's not how science or the scientific process works. </p>
<p>Real scientists appreciate other people questioning them because they see it as an opportunity to convince more people to the right thing. These people do the opposite</p>

I agree 100% 'The science is settled on this' comment is another authoritarian quip they make that sends chills down my spine.

Yeah the whole notion of science has been hijacked by a state-worshipping cult of deeply unhappy people who want to impose their will on others. 'S'cience is the new in hoc signo vinces...</p>

        <p>It's the same as the "Climate Denier!" label. (Which is terrible grammar and annoying.)</p>
<p>You can think that Climate changes, AND that things we as humans do contribute to it in negative ways, while also being skeptical of the model predictions or disagreeing with the policy proposals to fix it. Saying the Paris agreement is terrible because it's just a cash grab that ignores the problems in China and India doesn't mean you deny that Climate exists.</p>
<p>They're both just political cudgels.</p>

        <p>Well yeah comparing it to Hitler probably is a bit too much, what I meant with that comparison was that just like then people have no problem calling the police on people who go out against the lockdown orders for example just like people called the police on Jewish people back then. </p>
<p>Now obviously people nowadays aren’t being killed for it thankfully but this type of government loyalty is what's so bad &amp; not talking regular laws but these ridiculous draconian laws with COVID and lockdowns. And that's why I compared it to hitler because that type of behaviour of letting the government go overboard &amp; not questioning it “for our safety” is just the tools dictators use to have authoritarian police states etc.</p>

        <p>If that is your takeaway from this article, then you are scientifically illiterate. 0.5 ‘percentage point’ is <em>not</em> the same thing as 0.5 percent. It means growth rates declined, for example, from 2.5% to 2.0%. And when talking about exponential, compounding growth, this could lead to a very significant reduction in cases and deaths.</p>

        <p>I was explaining to you why 'percentage point decline' means something quite different from 'percentage decline' and why one should not interpret a 0.5 percentage point decline as being small. The example I gave was 2.5 percentage points to 2.0 percentage points, but that was just an example. </p>
<p>It really doesn't matter what the general growth rate is (whether its 2.5% or 10.5%), knocking half a percentage point off it will make a HUGE difference in case loads when these things are compounding daily. </p>
<p>In this article you linked they did not simulate the effect of the change, but there are plenty of articles and models which do just that, using data from studies like these. For instance, <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/texas?view=infections-testing&amp;tab=trend&amp;test=infections">this model</a> does just that for Texas and finds that continuing the mask mandate there would save significant numbers of lives (and reduce morbidity) over the next few months.</p>

<p>The fact is there no state or country that saw a decline in cases after mask mandates. The fact is Texas and Florida aren't doing any worse than California. </p>
<p>But more importantly, the fact is this isn't a deadly virus. The fact is the PCR test can be up to, and above, 90% wrong. </p>

        <p>In the US alone there have been <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home">530,000 deaths</a>. If the survival rate is as you say it is, it would mean there have been at least 530,000/0.01%=5,300,000,000 cases in the US, which is obviously absurd. </p>
<p>And yet, you claim that the PCR gives false positives, which would imply that there are actually <em>far fewer people</em> with actual COVID than are testing positive. So your arguments are already contradicting one another. </p>
<p>And according to <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-test-is-best-for-covid-19-2020081020734">Harvard's medical blog</a> on PCR tests:</p>
<p>&rt;What about accuracy? The rate of false negatives — a test that says you don’t have the virus when you actually do have the virus — varies depending on how long infection has been present: in one study, the false-negative rate was 20% when testing was performed five days after symptoms began, but much higher (up to 100%) earlier in infection.</p>
<p>&rt;The false positive rate — that is, how often the test says you have the virus when you actually do not — should be close to zero. Most false-positive results are thought to be due to lab contamination or other problems with how the lab has performed the test, not limitations of the test itself.</p>
<p>This implies that numbers on actual positive tests are likely bigger by 20% than reported.</p>
<p>The fact that the PCR test has been banned in some countries is not evidence that it is a faulty test. </p>
<p>&rt;They're all facts. You may ignore them, but that won't make them go away.</p>
<p>Just because you claim them to be facts, doesn't make it so. As I said before, if you want to continue this discussion, show me your evidence.</p>

        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 400k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 400K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>
<p>So try again there.</p>
<p>A false positive is when it says you have it, when you don't. This inflates the death rate by attributing deaths to the WuFlu that shouldn't be in that death count.</p>

        <p>&rt;The claim that COVID-19 killed around 400k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/debunking-the-false-claim-that-covid-death-counts-are-inflated1/">All this BS on the number of deaths being deflated has been debunked time and time again by people who actually know what they're talking about.</a> </p>
<p>&rt;Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can find almost anything in anybody". Ignored by the MSM.</p>

<p>&rt;Study from november 2020: PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 . Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>You are just cherry picking the 1 study that fits your narrative. There are hundreds out there that disagree. Again, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how science works. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Factsheet-for-Patients-2019-nCoV.pdf">PCR tests are absolutely accurate at detecting SARS-CoV-2</a></p>
<p>&rt;There are cases in which the false positive rate is 100%. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Are you really citing some random person on twitter as evidence? </p>
<p>&rt;Portuguese court has ruled that the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>So one single court in Portugal claiming it as unreliable has you convinced? Another case of confirmation bias. You reject all the piles of information that refute your claim and accept the only ones that fit your narrative, regardless of the credibility of the court. I believe the 99.99% of scientists and doctors who say PCR tests are reliable, not the one court in Portugal which says it isn't.</p>
<p>&rt;International experts suggest that up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>&rt;A false positive is when it says you have it, when you don't. This inflates the death rate by attributing deaths to the WuFlu that shouldn't be in that death count.</p>
<p>You misunderstand this article completely. Yes PCR tests will continue to test positive for several weeks or months after you've been infected, but when you are no longer contagious. They detect dead viruses. I can confirm this actually, as I was sick with Covid, and I tested positive with a PCR test for several weeks after my symptoms were gone. This does not mean they are not accurate. They are extremely accurate at detecting this virus that they even detect it after you recover, but the dead virus is still leaving your system. This would obviously not affect the statistics, since if you test positive once, future positive tests are not added to the statistics.</p>

<p>Wow, WuFlu. You sound like such a stereotype.</p>
<p>&rt;The tweet is about an actual thing. The fact you ignore what it says it's idiotic.</p>
<p>I can find tweets about people claiming the earth is flat. Should I believe those too? </p>
<p>&rt;A court can't pass anything without proof. Morso, I've shown you plenty of reasons why PCR tests aren't viable.</p>
<p>Funny that you'll believe this, but then reject actual science as propaganda. All you have shown me is dunked propaganda and misinterpretations of PCR tests.</p>
<p>&rt;Cool. And? Testing positive when you had it 2 months ago makes it a useless test that subjects you to cruel and unusual punishment. .</p>
<p>Again you are misinformed. If its been 2 weeks since your first positive test, there is no need to quarantine. 's becausMe continuing to test positive well after my illness ends does not place restrictions on me anywhere in this country. Thate people understand that the PCR test is a test for whether you have the SARS-CoV-2 virus in your system, live or dead. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm fairly certain I had it. Completely asymptomatic. My coworkers all think they have had it months ago as well. No one was bad enough to even call in sick to work.</p>
<p>That's great for you. I have buddies who worked in ER's in NYC and were overworked trying to handle this. They watched hundreds of people die from this virus as their hospitals became packed. I'm glad you got lucky and had an asymptomatic version. I too was relatively lucky. I felt like shit for 2 weeks, but was fortunate not to have trouble breathing. I still am not completely recovered 2 months later though. I know people who lost family members to this virus, who were young and healthy. </p>
<p>&rt;If you want to ignore facts, that's on you. Believing in propaganda is a choice.</p>
<p>Right back at ya buddy</p>

        <p>The fact you are unable to do much more than insult my word choice just shows you have no points. </p>
<p>So few things. First of Tom is a reporter for the NFL. Not a random guy. Morso, here's a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/nfl-has-77-apparently-false-positive-coronavirus-tests-from-lab.html">CNBC</a> article on the exact same thing. But hey, how can I fault you for not reaserching a damn thing? Afterall you seem to think masks work. </p>
<p>You haven't shown any Science. </p>
<p>&rt;If its been 2 weeks since your first positive test, there is no need to quarantine.</p>
<p>But</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/12/13/more-evidence-that-you-can-get-covid-19-coronavirus-twice/?sh=1fc61a8b1b9d">More Evidence That You Can Get Covid-19 Coronavirus Twice</a></p>
<p>So apparently no. On top of that where I live, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bu48pl5.jpg">if your test is negative, you still need to quarantine</a>. Because that makes sense right? </p>
<p>The death rate of the WuFlu is not correct. Chances are the vast majority of those deaths weren't WuFlu related. Afterall, <a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-11-17/COVID-19-was-spreading-in-Italy-by-September-2019-study-indicates-VuSqUttP8s/index.html">it was found in Italy in September 2019</a>. Weird how it took what, 7+ months to actually become an issue? But even then it didn't really do fuck all in most places until fall of 2020. </p>
<p>It's almost like it isn't a real concern to anyone.</p>
<p>You don't have facts bud. You don't even have a valid point.</p>

        <p>My initial belief on why this would be pointless has played out. You continue to reject overwhelming evidence that goes against your narrative, but will accept any piece of information from random garbage websites that support yours. You are citing random tweets as proof of something, and when I question that, your response is "Wait wait! They're from a reporter from a sports league!" On the other hand, if the director of the CDC tweeted something you would most likely write it off as propaganda. </p>
<p>It must be a tough life thinking that experts are all out to get you and lie to you, and the only people you can believe are snake oil salesman and hucksters. You have my pity.</p>

<p>The tweet is verified fact which I've shown you with a CNBC article.</p>
<p>The fact you ignore this and try to attack me personally is hilarious. You are unable to attack the science, because you have no facts. As a result you're left trying to attack the sources. Which is a miserable failure as again, it's a verified fact. You're obsession over Twitter instead of the CNBC article that carries the exact same information is astounding. If someone tweets "the sun will come up tomorrow", do you think the sun will not come up?</p>
<p>You have failed to make a single point. Meantime, I have shown evidence that masks aren't needed, are ineffective, are at worst dangerous, that the death count is heavily inflated, that the hospitals are getting a financial incentive to fluff numbers, that the PCR test is absolutely asinine, hell, <a href="https://www.chicagonow.com/dennis-byrnes-barbershop/2021/01/a-w-h-o-gift-to-biden-seemingly-fewer-covid-19-infections/">The WHO changed guidelines after Trump left office</a>, but I guess you'll ignore that as well.</p>

        <p>You do realize before the mandates that cases were growing exponentially tho right? The overall rates didn’t go down a lot but halting exponentially growth means a significant decreases verses the cases we were on pace to achieve.

        <p>Those images are too blurry to make out the info on the date axis so they are basically useless. Plus the max number you have on the case count verticals axis seems to to be very low where considering the true reported case counts per day during the worst of the pandemic in these countries which indicates to me that you are dishonestly cherry picking date ranges to line up with your incorrect conclusions.</p>

        <p>There's two elements to this. </p>
<p>First, there's the narrative with respect to public policy, and there's the narrative with respect to mechanism. Neither one appears to be complete and consistent. </p>
<p>So, public policy first. </p>
<p>The important thing to understand is that, for public officials, what is important is not what's actually going on, it is <strong>broad optics</strong>. So, the moment something is happening, the hustle is not to control the event, but to control the narrative. </p>
<p>The most dangerous situation for a politician is a crisis about which nothing can be done, because the truth is that <em>most people are submissive</em>. They don't <em>want</em> freedom, they don't want to know what is really going on, they don't <em>want</em> to make choices about their own lives, they just want the belief, correct or not, that someone is in charge who knows what they are doing, and problems are being handled for them. </p>
<p>A politician must create the appearance of action even when there is no useful action to take. </p>
<p>This is why we have closure policies and mask policies. It's not some Machiavellian plot to turn people into sheep who are used to obedience. It's because most people already <em>are</em> sheep, and they will get mad if the shepherd doesn't look busy and competent in order to inspire their trust. </p>
<p>The truth is that the modern connected hi-tech world <strong>has no effective defense against an airborne pandemic before the creation of a vaccine</strong>, and vaccines take about a year. </p>
<p>So, for the first year, there is absolutely nothing to be done except life-support treatment for the sick, but you can't let the sheep know that or they will get mad. Not panic, mind you. You don't care if the sheep are scared. Scared is better because scared sheep are obedient. But angry sheep will pick a new shepherd. And when sheep get angry, they will demand you do something even when there is nothing to be done. </p>
<p>So what do you do? </p>
<p>Well, there's a mask that you think works, or at least helps, called an N95. It's designed for this sort of thing. But it's in limited supply, and it's disposable... it won't work if you reuse it. And it has to be fit properly. </p>
<p>The thing is, you do <em>not</em> want the public knowing this. Why? Because these things are for sale, and there is a limited production capacity to make them. The people you need wearing them are the medical staff who are dealing with your infected. So you can't have the public buying them up, and creating a shortage. </p>
<p>So you tell them "masks don't work, they may actually increase infection rates, don't wear one". Remember that bit? </p>
<p>Okay, so then what happens is that people start covering their faces with pieces of cloth. Just ordinary cloth. Okay, you say, well, cloth isn't in short supply. Let's tell them that works. In fact, let's order them to do it. That way we will look like we are doing something, like we <em>can</em> do something, and, better yet, they'll stop buying up the PPE we want to save for hospitals. Let's also de-emphasize hand sanitizer, because we are running out of capacity to produce that. </p>
<p>Enter mask orders. </p>
<p>They're not for some sinister plot. They are for preserving the illusion that we can do anything to fight this thing. </p>
<p>So that's the politics of this. Well, what about the science? What about the mechanism? Why wouldn't a piece of cloth over your face prevent you from exhaling infected droplets? Isn't that just common sense? </p>
<p>Well, the thing about the phrase "common sense" is that it's a euphemism for "I have no concrete evidence". This is because people don't need to appeal to it when concrete evidence is available to them. </p>
<p>So what they do instead of tell a story that seems to make sense. And conclude that because it seems to make sense, it must be true. But every time we do research, and get actual data, we learn that "plausible" and "accurate" are not the same thing. No, Aristole, heavier objects do <em>not</em> fall faster. No, the sun does <em>not</em> orbit the earth. No, eating foods with cholesterol in them does <em>not</em> raise your cholesterol levels. No, saturated fat does not give you heart disease. No, bicycle helmets do not make you safer. No, calorie-restricted diets do not result in sustained fat loss. No, socialism does not improve quality of life for the poor. </p>
<p>And so on. </p>
<p>So, it's obvious that a piece of cloth over your mouth will catch some of the things you exhale. But that's not question. The question is, is it enough to make a difference? </p>
<p>Direct studies say no, and infection rates in states with mask orders resemble infection rates in those without, if you control for population density and mobility. </p>
<p>Why? Well, hard to say. Perhaps the cloth just doesn't catch enough in the first place. Perhaps unwashed masks eventually become saturated transmission vectors in their own right. Perhaps the primary transmission vector is fingers and surfaces. It's hard to say. </p>
<p>But the fact that government is telling you to do something doesn't mean it's a good idea. Remember, these are the fun folks who gave us the food pyramid, and told us to eat margarine instead of butter. </p>
<p>Personally, it's all academic for me. I've had the disease, so I can't get it, and I can't give it to anyone else. Same for anyone who's vaccinated, assuming the vaccine works. I'm not going to get that, of course, because I've had the vaccine that always works. I'll let somebody else risk whatever sides there might be from a hasty vaccine. Good luck, folks.</p>

        <p>When you consider that COVID-19 uses an aerosol vehicle that image is amazing.</p>
<p>Problem: shotgunning aerosols into everyone's faces<br>
Solution-ish: suppress it</p>
<p>Also:
&rt; Despite the current limited scientific data detailing their effectiveness, we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection status they don't know. However, we also encourage everyone to continue to limit their time spent indoors near potentially infectious people and to not count on or expect a cloth mask or face covering to protect them or the people around them.</p>
<p>So they're actually pretty smart.</p>

        <p>You’re worse than them. At least they are delusional to think there is no reason to wear a mask. You accept that there’s a virus and that it’s deadly. And yet you refuse to be slightly inconvenienced by wearing a mask, which could save people’s lives. And then you try to act all high and mighty about it too, really amazing.</p>

        <p>By that same logic, I bet you don't wear seatbelts. Or put on sunscreen at the beach. Or wear a helmet on a bicycle or motorbike. Everyday we do plenty of minimally invasive things to reduce risks. Putting a mask on your face when you're inside with other people while a virus is spreading like wildfire is no different.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I wear a mask; mostly out of a desire to avoid conflict, but still felt it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Secondly, mask mandates have had little to no impact on case numbers and deaths.</p>
<p>Thirdly, even if your reasoning was correct, it means this plan to make everyone wear masks does not take into account human nature and is doomed to fail, so we need a different strategy.</p>

        <p>Oh boy here we go</p>
<p>Let me wake you up from this concept of the anti-lockdowner you all seem to have crafted, who aren’t really suffering from lockdowns’ effects and just advocating against them because they don’t want to be mildly inconvenienced.</p>
<p>If you think lockdowns are nothing more than a slight inconvenience, you are privileged.  There’s no two ways about it.  You are financially well off enough for them not to drastically affect your life financially.  You’re mentally healthy enough for them to not drastically effect your life emotionally.  You’re not a child who’s having their key development stages interrupted by this cold, cruel lack of human interaction.  You’re not living in a war-torn country, dying because lockdowns disrupted food transportation, immunisation services etc.  You’re not elderly and living the last few months or years of your life in anguish and loneliness.  You’ve not been given a death sentence because lockdowns meant your cancer didn’t get diagnosed.</p>
<p>Anti-lockdowners either suffer through that shit or have enough empathy to recognise that others do, and that this is wrong.</p>
<p>And that’s before we even bother going into how clearly ineffective these measures are.</p>

        <p>This may come as a surprise to you, but I completely agree with you that those who can make it through lockdowns without significant financial, health, or personal hardship absolutely do have a privilege. I do worry about the children who will have development issues due to this (possibly my nephews). I am absolutely concerned about those living in developing countries- in fact, my job involves working to help people like this. </p>
<p>If the US were not full of people like you, and people in this sub who refused to wear a mask and lockdown for a couple of weeks because of "My Freedoms!!!" then we could have beat this thing early on, and avoided these extended lockdown measures. This was done in dozens of countries around the world, countries that have nothing unique about them except that they aren't full of idiot conspiracy theories. In South Korea, Vietnam, Australia, China, etc. life is pretty much back to normal. </p>
<p>I think you need to reflect on your own privilege in refusing to wear a mask and dodging behind arguments like "ITS AN INFRINGEMENT ON MY RIGHTS" "I HAVE A RIGHT TO NOT WEAR A MASK EVEN IF IT WILL KILL PEOPLE AND EXTEND THESE LOCKDOWN MEASURES" "POLITICIANS WANT TO USE COVID TO CONTROL ME!!!!!". You and people like you are the ones forcing these extended public health measures on all of us. You and people like you are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people who didn't need to die if you could have just put a damn cover over your face holes and stayed mostly inside for a couple of weeks. THAT is privilege.</p>

        <p>You are cherry-picking examples of countries who happen to have the combination of harsh measures and low deaths, not that I even quite believe life is back to ‘normal’ even in those places.  There is no real correlation between extremity of measures and covid success; since lockdowns don’t CAUSE covid, random distribution of success and failure is what we’d expect to see from an ineffective method, and that is what we are seeing.  There are plenty of examples of countries where google data is showing everyone locking down and making sacrifices, where the covid deaths are high as fuck.  There are also plenty of examples of countries with few or no measures who are doing fine.  As for your assumption that countries that are doing better are merely doing better due to a lack of ‘conspiracy theorists’, what are you even basing that on?  Have you lived in all those countries?  You’ve just decided that they’re incapable of diversity of thought in places that have covid success because it fits your argument.</p>
<p>You see, this is the other half of the ‘my freedoms’ argument.  Our freedoms aren’t being taken away to save lives.  They’re being taken away for nothing, because these measures don’t even work.  For whatever reason (even if you DID turn out to be right and it was all anti-maskers’ faults), this strategy is a big fat failure, and we need a new one.  It’s not like there aren’t other options!  Protect the vulnerable and let everyone else get on with their lives!  Or beef up your health services to an insanely good level with all the money that has instead been spent on all this lockdown nonsense!  Or recommend stuff instead of mandate, make it easier for people to stay at home, so that anyone who’s scared can self-isolate, and so that trust in the government reaches a level where ‘conspiracy theorists’ don’t pop up in the thousands.</p>

        <p>What is "Covid" that makes it any more necessary to freak out over then a "Viral pneumonia"?? What is the actual strain, sequenced and isolated, and what are it's specific effects? Because I actually don't believe in "Covid", when all you hear is everything is "Novel" and they have no concrete data. I believe in viral pneumonia and it's ability to mutate, much like our immune system can to solve it.</p>

        <p>There’s no denying the virus is real and it is killing (majority older and less healthy) people. CDC has posted recorded deaths for 2019 and 2020 and on average there are about 35k excess deaths a month in 2020. There’s no denying it and yet even on this sub I’ve been downvote attacked for saying that lol. </p>
<p>It’s real (although not as dangerous to healthy people as alluded by the media), and the media-govt complex has taken full advantage of the fear and used it politically as well. AND cloth masks are up for debate on how effective they are but we live in a free country so I don’t give a shit what you wear. So yeah hopefully there are more people that fit in that circle than not 👍🏽</p>

        <p>I think the numbers in Western countries are totally fabricated. Countries in Asia with higher population densities have FAR lower numbers than Western countries. They give various reasons for this like different strains or people in Asia mask up, but to me the only plausible explanation is that the Western countries are cooking their books to push their snake oil.</p>

        <p>experts who?</p>
<p>theres usually raw data that you can look up an then make up your own mind.<br>
you don't need "experts" to do that for you.</p>
<p>most are not lying. they represent their opinion and use data to support it.<br>
for a virologist the number 1 priority is to reduce the spread and death cause by the virus DIRECTLY.<br>
a virologist won't consider long term adverse effects of lockdowns (okay, some do, its just an example though). such as worse healthcare in the future due to a recession, impact on 3rd world countries, mental health issues or lack of education.</p>

        <p>I use raw data for my case as well. Problem is it doesn't add up. Data A provided by experts doesn't add up with data B provided by experts. Look at what they say about vaccine for instance. According to them, the vaccine's efficiency is around 95% percent but after getting vaccined we're required to take the same safety measures we did even before getting vaccined. That's not how a properly functioning vaccine works.</p>

        <p>I honestly wonder how much of COVID is real and how much is psychogenic illness. I don't consider myself to have definitive information, so I also don't have definitive views. That said, I'm just trying to make sense of the damn data.</p>
<p>there are cases out there that seem to indicate COVID, in some instances, can affect people in a highly irregular way, a way that does not coincide with the state of their physical health. Specifically, I'm talking about young people dying when they're healthy. As far as I can tell, there are real cases that meet this criteria. They're uncommon and they're largely contrary to the average case, but I don't think deception explains them; I think some of them are really out there.</p>
<p>to me, the data defies any standard explanatory model. It requires the introduction of some extraordinary mechanism. I speculate whether psychosomatic effect is the missing link that explains it, because it could be. There's obviously a psychological profile that is common between mass numbers of persons which we know has been formed largely by some external influence, so I'm just trying to follow the trail here. What is the purpose of that profile? What does it do?</p>
<p>I also wonder whether there's a whole other virus, or some other biological agent, cloaking itself in the midst of all this COVID hysteria. Something with a similar effects profile. Possibly released intentionally in targeted locations by some deliberate actor, possibly engineered in some lab to degrade quickly and evade detection. Why? Because sowing mass confusion is obviously a central element of this operation. If they wanted a truly fearsome virus to ravage the population for real, that's exactly what we'd have. If they wanted us to have reason to believe the overreaching was truly necessary, again, that's exactly what we'd have. The inconsistency is not a bug, it's a feature. What does it mean?</p>
<p>of course, everything I'm saying is speculative. All I have is speculation. I don't have definitive information. I'm just trying to make sense of the damn data.</p>

        <p>My guess would be that those people were not healthy, as they've turned out not to be on a bunch of occasions when articles claimed they were. If they were, barring extreme bad luck, it wasn't covid.</p>
<p>(If you wanted a conspiracy theory that had it being covid, Ok, the 'two viruses' one works. It would explain the panic if there was standard, all natural covid, and a genuinely more dangerous engineered one -it wouldn't need to be that dangerous to be bad on a population-level. Covid isn't ideal, as it is-, both having escaped by accident. I don't believe that, though.)</p>
<p>I've heard of cases of psychologists being ridiculous about 'psychosomatic' illness often enough, and had them be mind-bogglingly stupid at me, someone visibly physically disabled, that I'm just not willing to believe it exists, rather than being all in psychologists' heads. I mean, when they call 'psychosomatic' on some poor person and it turns out to be cancer, you know? They are, too often, unscientific idiots whose 'hammer' isn't even adequate for mental illness, because that's not 'all in your head', either. We know that some conditions, like autism and ADHD, are neurological. We know they're linked to other conditions, like OCD. We have some good biological evidence for that, too, but it's not classified as neurological, because ~~psychologists suck~~ reasons. It can come with physical sensations, but that should not be surprising, because the brain is physical, stress response is physical, etc. We can link all three of these conditions to connective tissue disorders, which are physical and entirely out of psychologists' dubious remit, and which also cause a hell of a lot of, sometimes quite complex and interconnected, problems. I should know, typing with my fingers getting stuck in unnerving-looking positions. Trust me, psychologists are big enough assholes to be capable of hearing a detailed explanation of very physical and absolutely irrefutable health problems, all gore included -my connective tissue is weak so my spine is literally collapsing on itself, it's like a squished pile of pebbles at the bottom, the X-rays prove it, and I didn't have it filled with metal for funsies-, and instead of saying something sane like 'wow, that really sucks', they'll go 'how about some CBT gaslighting for those negative thoughts you persist in having about being in total agony?'.</p>
<p>And look at the amount of ethics on display from them last year, with their helpful plan for the government to terrify and nudge the British population into submission. They exist to control, not help. It's much of the history of the field. Including the times they've blamed people for illnesses that, you guessed it, we now know are physical.</p>
<p>So, yeah. Abolish psychology. /soapbox</p>

        <p>the things you're describing are completely capable of having psychological causes. Psychological behavior has a causative effect on a later neurological profile, so neurological evidence doesn't really demonstrate anything. I'm sorry to be hurtful toward you, but the attitude you're displaying also matches the same profile that would be necessary to explain the phenomena psychologically.</p>
<p>have you considered taking your own shit just a little less seriously? Why are you fighting so hard just to defend the premise that says your own version of your problems is truly reality? Is that a cause worth fighting for, would you say?</p>

        <p>And if I could make a point. The number of deaths in the major cities were probably because of negligence. Whenever I hear someone saying "wear a mask" it just makes me mad because my good friend Chris DID wear a mask at all times. He went to the hospital with a terrible earache and was waiting there for six hours. He was then seen, told to go home and rest, and a week later he is struggling to get into the ambulance due to severe breathing problems. Turns out he had COVID-19 and died on a respirator two weeks later. They never checked him out for COVID-19 when he was there for his earache, which could have been his saving grace. Also, if his family and friends had been able to visit him, he may have been able to find the willpower to live. It was probably overwhelmingly lonely under that respirator and he lost the will to live. Of course, this is only conjecture on my part. But it will always stay with me as a medical mistake that he died. He was losing weight and had lost 60 pounds last summer. He never smoked or drank. Medical negligence leading to patients deaths will never be fully accounted for because of the veil of mystery around the virus. Stop telling people to wear masks, but start the public education around the virus symptoms more clearly. Publicly shaming people who go out with a virus is also detrimental.</p>

        <p>Not necessary, I have a signed confession on tape, given willingly with zero duress, combined with plenty of circumstantial evidence that the suspect did as she claims (means, motive and opportunity), that's enough for a conviction in any court.</p>
<p>In addition the suspect has shown a clear ability and willingness to alter evidence, so I can't reasonably be expected to provide it. If you want to challenge this, you now have to prove that every single reported Covid death was not linked to any other causes.</p>
<p>The analogy would be if someone admitted to killing people and disposing of their bodies in an untraceable way, at that point I don't need to prove anything else because I already have a confession and plenty of circumstantial evidence that the victims were last seen with the suspect.</p>
<p>I can't be expected to prove the suspect killed them because the suspect can prove the bodies were disposed of beyond recovery. If you want to prove the opposite, you can now only do so by proving that every single possible victim is alive and ell.</p>

        <p>I'm asking for a single verifable case of this widespread problem. A problem that you say is so widespread that it makes the covid numbers meaningless. Surely there is one verifiable case you can find of this. The fact that you can't and instead go into this psudo-lawyer speak really says all I need to know.</p>

        <p>I believe that COVID is real and has been in other species for a long time, however, I don’t feel that it is as dangerous as the media and political forces want it to be. I don’t care if someone wears a mask or not. That is what they choose and it doesn’t affect me. I wear the mask just in case because nothing is informative and factual anymore....Also, I don’t want to be stared at.</p>

        <p>Agreed, I’m being called an anti-vaxxer because I won’t take the covid vaccine.</p>
<p>I am literally vaccinated, I get my tetanus booster whenever I need it.</p>
<p>Just because I don’t see the point in a vaccine that doesn’t actually stop you from getting covid, or stop the spread of covid. Surely only makes me anti-one type of vaccine?</p>

        <p>I find the problem with the 'believers' is that they don't stop to consider other possibilities apart from the ones they hear all day in TV and hear from governments. 
Just to clarify considering something wouldn't mean they'd have to believe it, but at least consider that there could be another possibility, it would give some space for thought and critical thinking. 
But no. 
They just deny straight away, whatever different thoughts we have on all of this and cancel the ones that are not buying into everything that's on TV and said by governments.</p>
<p>If people think we are not buying this, because of what's going on, they're so wrong. Governments have been corrupt since the beginning of its times, and if people have a bit of brain, would be always skeptical about whatever governments says. I know I have always been skeptical about governments.</p>
<p>They will never do "everything" in their power for the greater good or for the good of people.
 If at least, more people considered this, then we would see more people changing their minds. The problem is, they already believed blindly in governments way before this bullshit.</p>
<p>Trying to go against the current, will indeed be a great challenge.</p>

        <p>I don't think people should focus on masks here, it lessens the rest of the arguments against lockdowns which are the real menace. Masks in places like shops have almost no downside, and there is good evidence of their efficacy. I'm anti-lockdown but I don't want to be assosciated with the morons screaming about a bit of cloth.</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

        <p>Whatever, they still aren't a hindrance on my life, lockdowns are. As far as I care let them have that one if it means getting my life back to normal otherwise faster. The mask argument is one of principle which is why anyone complaining about it looks like a petulant child, and it makes it easier for people to lump reasonable anti lockdown discussions in with these idiots.</p>

        <p>The one about masks being a symbolic issue that lessens the anti-lockdown argument by associating it with nutcases who scream at store cashiers.
It's as relevant as refusing any other social norm that doesn't affect us otherwise, like wearing a tie or not wanking on a bus.</p>

        <p>So is wearing a tie. With the plethora of major issues lockdown has caused to us all, digging in on the mask issue seems silly. Again, having to don a bit of cloth over my mouth for the duration of my grocery shopping hasn't harmed my life in even the smallest way. The fact I can't work, travel, see my family or friends for a year has been hugely detrimental to my welfare. If none of those issues existed apart from masks, I'd probably be on your side. I'm not sold on them completely, but I struggle to find them even a little inconvenient.</p>

        <p>Wearing a tie dates back to the 1600s. That's not a mandate. Morso, there's no law saying you need to wear a tie. Only private business regulations. </p>
<p>Masks can cause bacterial pneumonia which can cause long term lung damage. It's not ok to wear them under and pretext.</p>

        <p>Generally agree, but I think the politics of it is simply that politicians feel if they can't demonstrate leadership in a situation like this then what are they good for.  And how else to 'demonstrate leadership' but boss people around.</p>

        <p>Additionally:<br>
I think that the PCR test was a big mistake, creating many (&rt;95%) false positives and confusion..<br>
I think that Big Pharma tries to push their vaccines to everyone for profits. They also got a lot of money in advance.<br>
I think that the virus is not dangerous for most people. Got it myself, and some friends.  </p>
<p>It seems dangerous in combination with a bacterial infection, and for people with a low T-cell immunity. The masks may increase the bacterial infection. The T-cell immunity needs vit-D (sunshine) physical exercise, and training via social contact. </p>
<p>This means that the severity of the disease is INCREASED by the covid-measures. And that is why countries that DO NOTHING DO BETTER.</p>

        <p>The problem is this is too generic.  Because i do believe people have the right to wear a mask or not but on their own...its when you go in public and put others at risk because you decide not to is the issue.  Also the crazy people who think they can enter private institutions and not follow their mask policy.  The real world just doesn't work like this.</p>
