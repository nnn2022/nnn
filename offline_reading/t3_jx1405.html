        <p>This reminds me of my seventy-six year old friend. He has been calling this the event that TPTB are using to usher in the One World Government since the beginning, citing that the odds of survival are 99% and yet they want everything shut down.</p>
<p>He is now stating that the voter fraud against Trump is because Biden is part of the NWO that will help collapse the US and Trump was doing everything he could to avoid such things.</p>
<p>Again, his words not mine but I am starting to wonder if perhaps he is on to something...</p>

        <p>My 76 year old friend says Trump is in on it too. All the rich retire quietly. Where is Bush right now? Notice how Obama was silent all those 4 years and now suddenly back with a book about 'the promised land'. They are all in this. </p>
<p>There is no left or right. just up and down.</p>

        <p>That is the image of Politics that I have painted for so long but, ever since Trump was elected President as an "Outsider", people start claiming that the system is not like that and he is one of them!</p>
<p>I have no doubt that Trump being elected as President was part of the plan for a civil uprising when he eventually has to leave office and I have no reason to doubt that he is part of the plans of TPTB. </p>
<p>The people that voted for him look at him like he is "The Messiah" and can do no wrong even when he does things that they don't agree with, much like people on the left looked at (and still do) Obama as their "Messiah". This plan for the unraveling of America was many years in the making.</p>

        <p>I just quoted this particular scene about 3 hours ago. So yes, I definitely feel this way.</p>
