    <strong>Work requiring vaccine—</strong>
    <p><p>Here’s the jist at my work... 1) You have to be vaccinated to travel 2) if you’re in sales traveling is core part of job 3) if you can’t travel you can’t meet job requirements 4) if you can’t meet job requirements... you don’t have a job.      That was the message delivered to our entire sales team.  </p>
<p>We are allowed to get a medical or religious exemption; or lie about it and say we got it.   What would you do and why? I am the breadwinner for my family and “taking a stand” frankly isn’t practical or fair to my 3 kids and spouse.  </p>
<p>I don’t have a medical exemption really, how would I go about getting one? Call a doctor and ask for a bogus note? The religious piece seems way too flimsy and I haven’t seen one argument on how to do it succeed; lastly should I just lie? I’m worried if I do someday they’ll prove I didn’t get it OR want proof that I did get it.</p></p>

        <p>Claim religious exemption. If you lie then when they try to jet you off, you will then either need to book a shot ASAP anyway, or admit you lied.</p>
<p>Same issue with medical exemption - you will likely have to prove that.</p>
<p>Religious exemption has no "proof". It's a belief. Easiest one.</p>

        <p>Lying about either option will put you on a slippery slope. It may buy you time,  but you should assume it only does that. Your best option is start seeking other employment now.  Different businesses will have different policies.</p>

        <p>Only if you get caught though. Plus, at least in my neck of the woods, employer's aren't allowed to ask for documents anyway. I think if push came to shove, the same would apply in the US as well. Medical records are private information and should be constitutionally protected.  </p>
<p>Could be grounds for a hefty lawsuit. I'd be on the lookout for impending lawsuits of this nature springing up shortly. If/when this starts happening, employers will all most likely put the kibosh on vaccine requirements as a condition of employment.</p>

        <p>Look, no one said it was going to be easy, having a spine in life. They will make it hard on us all, in one way or another. That's what this whole covid circus is about. Choices will have consequences. But, making a stand against medical tyranny like this is ALWAYS fair. Your children will be proud of you later in life, that daddy was not like the rest of the braindead zombies. </p>
<p>I would try a religious exemption, even if you are a non-believer in Christ, injecting yourself with an experimental gene therapy, not officially approved/assessed (clinical trials run &rt;2023), of which several are produced using aborted foetal cell lines, is nothing to be ashamed of. Perhaps it would even speak for you, as a person that stands his ground. In the meantime, scout around for alternative employment options in another company or other line of work. That is, if you care about keeping control over your health and body more than money.</p>

        <p>Religious exemption is very easy. My daughter is mostly vaccinated, but missing a couple that my husband and I don’t believe are necessary (looking at you pertussis). There are forms online you can print and sign. They are less than 1 page and are perfect for your needs. You don’t have to state what your religion is and from what I’ve read, they can’t ask. </p>
<p>You won’t get a medical exemption unless you’ve had severe reactions to similar meds in the past. With this being a new type of vaccine, I can’t imagine that’s even possible. I’m sure some medical issues would warrant an exemption, but that would be rare.</p>

        <p>I think the line for me is the vaccine, I appreciate all the comments I think what I’m going to do is just make them fire me. Obviously that will suck but I am not going to compromise my morals or beliefs and that includes being a liar, which I am not, I appreciate everyone’s insight on this. Part of me wants to ask them if they’re willing to except liability for any adverse reactions and demanded in writing, if they won’t do that then why would I get the vaccine would be my question to them.</p>

        <p>Which is insane.</p>
<p>Nuremburg code is known throughout most of these nations, and they're all literally breaking it.</p>
<p>Where are all the human rights lawyers once we actually need them? Oh right, nowhere. Now their job requires grit and unlikely to get paid, they've fucked off.</p>

        <p>https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2021/02/24/employer-mandate-covid-vaccine-eua/</p>
<p>The above link suggests that a business could require an individual to take a drug that only has emergency use authorization.</p>
<p>&rt; Practically, the federal government has consistently seen products under emergency authorization as not suitable for mandating. The ethical argument is that these products are still experimental, and therefore should not be mandated.</p>
<p>&rt; However, the question has never been tested in court, and there are very strong legal arguments against this view.</p>
<p>A different view here</p>
<p>https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/federal-law-prohibits-employers-and-others-from-requiring-vaccination-with-a-covid-19-vaccine-distributed-under-an-eua/</p>
<p>The information in this link says businesses can't mandate the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt; Federal law prohibits employers and others from requiring vaccination with a Covid-19 vaccine distributed under an EUA</p>
<p>&rt; EUAs are clear: Getting these vaccines is voluntary</p>
<p>&rt; The same section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that authorizes the FDA to grant emergency use authorization also requires the secretary of Health and Human Services to “ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed … of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product.”</p>
