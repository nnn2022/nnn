    <strong>When did you realise that the lockdowns / pandemic were overhyped/ over exaggerated</strong>
    <p><p>For me it was in April after the barrage of news stories trying to scare me.  When lockdown happened in the UK I was kinda  scared because of the news reports from Italy , how everyone needed a ventilator and the staggering death toll.  Of course when the virus got worse in the UK we had more horror stories.  Hospitals were going to be overwhelmed and videos from Covid 19 patients in MSM news with titles like “ coronavirus wants to kill you” and “ don’t make my mistake”. I realised that there was little to be afraid of, despite the media jumping on any case with a young person infected.  I never really watched the news or other media like it so was fairly ignorant to their tactics.  I was however skeptical of the lockdowns knowing the effects on my education it would have and effects on jobs.  I was fine with 2 weeks to buy time and with little knowledge on viruses I figured we’d be ok after that. I wasn’t thinking of the virus before March and just lived my life </p>
<p>Then came the videos on Tik Tok with nurses dancing in full PPE, going directly against the narrative that hospitals are like war zones and the no PPE thing lost all credibility for me.  The hero worship of healthcare staff got ridiculous with those weekly “ clap for carers “ event at 8pm. </p>
<p>When did you guys take the red pill so to speak</p></p>

        <p>It was in April for me as well.</p>
<p>I'm a frontline manager at my local hospital. People were terrified in March. We prepared, "war gamed," and got everything in order for the thrush to come.</p>
<p>Some of my staff decided to quit outright, one retired early. The rest of us however prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>Weeks pass, the Governor (MN) said no elective surgeries, which is our bread and butter, and we were running at 15% capacity.</p>
<p>We furloughed staff, closed 2 of our 3 Medical / Surgical wings, and still very few people came.</p>
<p>We had Covid patients (we still get a few) but the onslaught never came... and with that, schedules got shifted, and positions that were on furlough were eliminated. I have a great staff, this crushed me.</p>
<p>Part of my duties include being part of our C-19 Respobse team. We keep track of everything. Our hospital systems internal infection prevention team threw out the MN models (which could be the worst in the country. 20,000+ dead by now is still the estimate they are using) and our internal data has shown that, even at our hospitalization peak at the end of May, we would have had plenty of room.</p>
<p>At most, our hospital had 2 Covid patients at a time, and that was in May. We have had zero Covid hospitalizations for the last 8 days, and we have had zero Covid deaths during the entirety of the pandemic.</p>
<p>We were going to expand our hospital next year. That is off the table now. We would have been able to hire more staff, and ultimately help more people, but the response to this "crisis" destroyed that, and nearly put us under. Several of our enterprises clinics are now closed, for good.</p>
<p>I know that people have died from this, but we could have handled it. We know how to handle it, and dammit a lot of us are damn good at our jobs. The second order effects of the lockdowns will ultimately be felt for decades to come, and will be the cause of far more preventable deaths than Covid.</p>
<p>This can never happen again.</p>

        <p>Tim Walz is a truly awful person, and he deserves to be tried for crimes against humanity for the lives he has destroyed. I live in the suburbs in MN and we are absolutely flooded with the homeless, and as somebody who has been homeless twice myself this is extremely disheartening. </p>
<p>Mentioned how terrible what he was doing in r/minnesota was and everyone told me it wasn't his fault - right, he just put the executive orders into place so others were forced to follow his rules under penalty of law. That's not his fault!</p>
<p>The same people who were begging for lockdowns are now complaining about it, and still whining about us. I don't feel bad for them at all anymore. They need to experience the consequences of their actions, and maybe get just a GLIMPSE of the suffering they forced on others - it's the only way that they'd realize what they have done, and I still don't think they ever will.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: if you live in Minnesota and you have Tested positive for COVID, you’re twice as likely to die than you are in Florida or Texas (based on CDC data of deaths as a percentage of cases from yesterday).</p>
<p>It’s not because we (I’m from there too) have more cases; we don’t.  It’s because we completely dropped the ball on elder care/assisted living (which our state has a history of not addressing very well).  70+ year olds account for about 10% of COVID cases in MN but account for 80% of deaths (using MN dept. of health stats from yesterday).  But rather than focusing on where the risk is known to be greatest, we just issued a mask mandate for the whole state.  Even though there are many rural counties that have fewer than 20 cases reported... ever.  I get that death might not be the only serious effect of the disease, but it’s the only one we are reliably (presuming, for the sake of the argument) given and it tells a pretty clear story.</p>
<p>But make everyone wear masks.  That’ll make it look like our governor (who continues to wield emergency powers and so is the person calling all the shots) is doing something.</p>

<p>Relevant to my industry, the architects, engineers, equipment vendors and construction contractors who would have designed and built that hospital have lost out on that work.   This is killing the entire economy.</p>

        <p>Before they started, when the global fatality rate was 3.4%.  I kept thinking, "but you aren't catching every case".  I assumed 5-10x the cases as detected and then thought, "well this is fucking stupid".</p>

        <p>There was a survey recently indicating that Americans think the IFR is 7%. James Gunn for example (who I like) was tweeting about his covid+ friend who he believes has a 3-7% of dying: https://twitter.com/jamesgunn/status/1288941455386398720?s=21</p>
<p>I don’t know how anyone who reads the news - even the doomer-oriented outlets put the IFR in that ballpark - and think it’s that deadly.</p>

        <p>Mid-March I knew several people who came down with symptoms but they had no way to get tested to prove it. So it was obvious to me that the media/government obsession with confirmed cases and basing the IFR on that was skewing people's perceptions. </p>
<p>And yet access to testing was never prioritised here in the UK. It was clear the government was just itching to enact emergency powers and, in that regard, sowing uncertainty and chaos suited them much more than being cautious and rational.</p>

        <p>The protests - at that moment I understood that everyone in power knew that the virus was not a real threat.</p>
<p>This made sense of Fauci's initial misleading statement about "there are no treatments," which even at the time I understood to be code for "this is about mandatory vaccines," whereas easy research in Bill Gates' AMA on Reddit revealed many, many "potential" treatments, the big one being you know what.</p>
<p>And as others commented, the lack of dead bodies. Wasn't it strange that none of the employees at the small grocery store I go to, died / got sick / disappeared? Nor did I hear of any employee at any store dying or mysteriously disappearing.</p>
<p>On June 9 I went to a large specialized medical facility for a previously scheduled routine appointment. It was obvious to me that everyone who worked there did not think the virus was a threat. I could just tell. There's a difference between mandated changes in routines vs. how a large specialized medical facility would act if people were walking around with Ebola or smallpox.</p>
<p>That day I was officially done with this crap.</p>

        <p>&rt; The protests - at that moment I understood that everyone in power knew that the virus was not a real threat.</p>
<p>Tipping point for me as well. Just the idea that anything could suddenly become more important than a "life-treatening pandemic" was the kick to realizing it was all theatre.</p>
<p>It also coincided with the start of the mask narrative's big push, and the last time I heard anyone sane refer to "two weeks away".</p>
<p>I was never that afraid of getting sick, and now my fear is completely focused around how bad other humans will make society.</p>

        <p>It was never said to be like the black death lol - the relatively low risk for the young has always been part of the "mainstream narrative".</p>
<p>So yeah I'd say protests against tyrannical triggerhappy cops could very well be sth that outweighed a pandemic of that relatively low threat level - quit being stupid lol.</p>

        <p>I never bought into it. When they first announced the lockdown, I was against it although I will admit that I was willing to go along with shutting down 2-3 weeks to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed (that was a good sell on their part). So why was I against it? Because I knew from the very beginning it would NEVER only last 2-3 weeks. How did I know? Because at that time, cases and deaths were rapidly rising. We didn't even hit peak deaths until a few weeks into the lockdown. I knew that there was no way in hell that while deaths were climbing toward peak levels, there was non stop doom and gloom coverage on the media and testing was almost impossible to get, that they would be like "Ok, let's reopen now". </p>
<p>So I knew the lockdowns would last months and I knew they would be very difficult to come out of because after convincing the public the virus is so dangerous they can't leave their house for months, people aren't suddenly going to start behaving normally again if the virus is still around. It's like telling someone, don't go outside there is a bear out there right now. Then a little later you say ok, you can go outside now and they ask "Is the bear gone?" and your answer is no, it's still very much a threat, how many people do you think will keep on staying inside?</p>
<p>So I knew from the start we were kissing life as we knew it goodbye and I couldn't understand why people were so willing to go along with it.</p>

        <p>The day I picked my kid up from school. They said we would back by March 28th. A lot of people gave me a funny look for my funny look but not looking so funny anymore huh? </p>
<p>I knew the school year was over and I knew this would be used, like 911, to institute a new framework. To be honest, I've been waiting for this for about 12 or 13 years.  Just didnt pick up on the virus angle. I figured we have too many soft spots, another more serious terrorist event would happen.</p>
<p>This virus is a much better, more effective way to get it done.</p>

        <p>Post 9/11, they introduced the Patriot Act, which openly began mass public surveillance on American citizens.   Those in power used a terrorist attack to strip away many personal rights/liberties — guised to the supportive cries of the sleeping masses as necessary to “protect the US from ‘Radical Islamic Terrorism.’” The “attacks” by foreign terroristic actors resulted in massive increases in “security” (TSA, searches @ any large venue, amusement parks, etc.), combined with the emergence of big tech and their shady, unconstitutional &amp; spy-like mass surveillance tactics. In response, the Department of Homeland Security was created, which merged 22 federal gov agencies under one umbrella. In 2002, DHS funding was $22B—in 2011, if exceed $43B. In creating DHS, Immigration and Customs &amp; Border Control were controlled by the DOJ however post-9/11, they were designated part of the newly established “ICE.” This is the same DHS we, ironically, see deploying similar tactics on American citizens in Portland, Seattle, etc. The organization created to protect us from terrorists is now being deployed against the same people it was founded, funded and enacted to protect. This was always the plan. Prior, the surveillance state was less than 1/2 it’s current size, you could get on a plane without first taking your shoes off, the US was not engaged in any wars &amp; we deployed less than 1/2 the soldiers around the world than we currently do. </p>
<p>In the decade following 9/11, deportations doubled and laws regarding non-citizen, immigrant &amp; illegal alien residents have been trampled on. Xenophobia, first introduced as anti-Muslim has evolved to anti-immigrant to now anti-Chinese. They knew they’d be successful given the hundreds of years of systematic oppression, hatred and racism that has been allowed to run so freely since the inception of the USA—well before, in fact. It’s all about creating hatred of groups that oppose their NWO agenda, based on misrepresented facts or falsified events.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the “war on terror” allowed the US to advance it’s Middle East agenda under the guise of defeating radical Islamic terrorism (which had high public approval), by using American military-led, operations to spread democracy, wipe out leaders that stood in opposition (Hussein, Gaddafi) , aided in political rebellions (Arab Spring Movement) and fueled the flames in the Middle East that has now resulted in ongoing wars, poverty, feminine, political instability, economic ruin and unrest. </p>
<p>I’ve always been very liberal, but I’ve seen things recently that have made me question everything. Party affiliation is increasingly meaningless, as the NWO truly controls both parties to manufacture the public’s perception that we do have a choice and that this is a democracy — free nations don’t consistently have to remind their people they have freedoms, that they live in the “most free nation” and the “most democratic society in the world.” In reality, both parties are controlled by the same few elite individuals. The most shocking evidence supporting the 9/11 conspiracy in my opinion, is the speech given by George HW. Bush on—I shit you not—9/11/1990 regarding ushering in a “new world order” by targeting specifically the Middle East and Saddam Hussein. Guised as a crisis in the Persian Gulf, HW presented a “fifth objective — a new world order — can emerge: a new era — freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.</p>
<p>Here he really set percent for what his son, George W Bush, would set into motion just 11 years later TO THE DATE on 9/11/01:</p>
<p>“Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.... The test we face is great, and so are the stakes. This is the first assault on the new world that we seek, the first test of our mettle. Had we not responded to this first provocation with clarity of purpose, if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination, it would be a signal to actual and potential despots around the world. America and the world must defend common vital interests — and we will. America and the world must support the rule of law — and we will. America and the world must stand up to aggression — and we will. And one thing more: In the pursuit of these goals, America will not be intimidated.” </p>
<p>All of this HAS been planned. Just kinda funny to me that the sleepy masses that championed the introduction of the Patriot Act, DHS, ICE, TSA, mass surveillance, two major military occupations of Afghanistan &amp; Iraq and even undressing at the airport are the same ones now believing a mask is government restriction on liberties. Those were all thrown away long ago, and it’s especially naive to think the mask is the problem. It’s more of the same—contract tracing programs, increasing mass surveillance, big tech censorship, testing the perceptions of total authoritarian control. Wear your damn mask, but consider becoming less dependent on technology, social media and your tracking device (aka cell phone). The mask feud has also been manufactured to incite passions to distract from what’s happening in terms of the overarching plan. We’re just getting started 😬 </p>

        <p>First week of April.</p>
<p>I took a week-long break from news and obsessively watching the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker to clear my head and get my emotions stabilized, and then looked around and had a major reckoning with the fact that literally no one I knew had gotten sick. No one was falling down in the streets. I thought, "Shouldn't I at least know someone who knows someone who has gotten <strong>deathly</strong> ill?" I didn't even know anyone who had gotten <strong>mildly</strong> ill. I realized that I had been working for months in a very vulnerable position with other people and that none of us had gotten sick. Of course, at that point, I still thought the lockdown and the insanity would end soon after. As time went on, and the goalposts simply moved and moved again, it became ABUNDANTLY  clear to me that there is a much bigger agenda happening here and we are only pawns in the game.</p>

        <p>Long time ago.  In the beginning, it was nothing more than the common flu (in severity).  Then I noticed that the media was over-hyping every single aspect of it- making it bigger and bigger- and things began shutting down... </p>
<p>Yet, the numbers just weren't that bad compared to other outbreaks from other viruses.  I knew then that this was just hype.</p>

        <p>The whole time.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say any one thing happened that triggered it. It was more like I thought all the event cancellations, school closings, being sent home to work was an overreaction. I also was seriously confused at everyone who shared about “social distancing” and “flattening the curve” acting like they were doing some virtuous thing. “If my husband and I can stay home on a Friday night, so can you!” “We’re doing something beautiful protecting the at risk!” “We’re giving doctors and nurses a fighting chance!” Everyone immediately anointed themselves heroes and talked about this like we were having some pep rally or happy birthday party. It made me roll my eyes instantly, and I found myself questioning why can I not still live my life? This can’t be worth it.</p>
<p>As a Catholic I was very concerned when the diocese closed to public Masses and canceled Holy Week Mass. I almost felt like evil had taken hold and was concerned about society as a whole. You can go to church online yes, but denying people their choice and right to go to a church building...I can’t believe that was ever acceptable! </p>
<p>I was dismissed about my part time job being cancelled because everyone was so focused on “just one life” and “it’s necessary.” I’m a little less bitter now, but the way the wealthy have treated the people who don’t have the same privileges they do...it does hurt me that people would say that to my face about a job they know I love. What if it were their job? You’re telling me you wouldn’t care? </p>
<p>I’ve never failed to believe we did the wrong thing. There had to have been ways to deal with this without shutting down society and causing all kinds of ripple effects on jobs, businesses and mental health. I spent time during the stay home orders wanting to die and wishing I’d get COVID because it would be better than this. </p>
<p>I only know two people who have been sick. Both recovered. Neither missing limbs or carrying oxygen tanks or reporting heart or brain damage. And they don’t support “the new normal” either. Even my 89 year old grandparents are still alive and well.</p>

        <p>I was skeptical all along. Got somewhat alarmed after watching Michael Osterhelm's interview on Joe Rogan ('10 times worse than the flu'), as around the same time my otherwise sensible and sober parents were beginning to panic.</p>
<p>But when I saw someone seriously predict 6,000,000 deaths in Italy, and when I noticed any skeptical voices were viciously shut down, I knew something very weird was going on. And it's just gotten weirder since...</p>
<p>I predicted back in March that the secondary effects of lockdown would dwarf covid in terms of death and generational suffering. Surely other people would see this? But no one did, except my fellow peeps here and those on lockdown skepticism.</p>

        <p>Ever since the beginning. You don't quarantine healthy people, and you don't fuck with people's livelihoods, even if pEopLe aRe DyiNG. Seeing the videos of nurses dancing in mostly empty wards was the last straw.</p>
<p>But in my case, it was the media crying wolf over Swine Flu, Mad Cow disease, foot and mouth disease, Ebola, Sars, Bird Flu, and all the other "pandemics" we've had that were barely a blip in the US. Sure, there's been deaths from Coronavirus, but the response has been so far out of line with the actual damage from the virus itself.</p>

        <p>When it switched from <em>flatten the curve</em> to <em>no leaving the house until a vaccine is found</em>. </p>
<p>When we got nowhere near the predicted death tolls and my nurse friend had tons of extra time to go out camping with her husband and kids.</p>
<p>When protesting for months didn’t increase the spread but wanting to go to dinner meant killing grandma. </p>
<p>I’m not as extreme as a lot of people on this sub (I still wear a mask while getting groceries and have no choice but to stay semi-working from home as the biggest part of my job requires 20k+ crowds) but I slowly began to realize that we’re just fucking being lied to. I’ve never been so unhealthy, physically or mentally. I’m slowly becoming a functional alcoholic because my life feels like it’s effectively over. Christ. Better to wake up late than never I suppose.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who’s a nurse too. The healthcare system she works for did have COVID patients but at no point (that I know of) was her hospital or any of the hospitals in the system overwhelmed. She also seemed to have enough Facebook activity during the day that I was convinced her hospital couldn’t have been overflowing, especially since she was posting pictures of the free food the staff was getting.</p>

        <p>At the time, my biggest concern was everyone rushing to the store, buying up everything to the point where stores have very high shortages of items and running out completely for months.  </p>
<p>This was why I panicked, and was trying to stockpile what I could (including toilet paper and whatnot) before everyone else did like a fool.</p>

        <p>Because people wanna make sure they can still wipe their ass if they can't leave home for a month. That, and many people use toilet paper to wipe their nose or clean the toilet seat. Now that the cycle of panic buying has begun, many people are just buying toilet paper to get while the gettin' is good, continuing the cycle of demand and shortage. My mother-in-law actually bought a big pack today, even though my husband wondered where she would put it because our hall closet is full. Evidently in her bedroom.</p>

        <p>Took it pretty seriously at first. Walked through the store when all was still normal with a cart full of supplies, knowing normalcy would soon be out the window. It was very strange being seemingly the only one aware that this would soon be a big issue. I didn't wear a mask (don't believe it would have helped unless I wore a respirator which would have freaked people out in early March and I'm young and relatively healthy)... sanitized everything, washed hands compulsively, didn't leave the house for 3 weeks after stocking up. No, I'm not the asshole who bought all the sanitizer and toilet paper. Mostly frozen goods and water just in case but I didn't get more than I needed to eat for a few weeks. The whole time, I kept up obsessively with the latest coverage from all sources (the wuhan flu sub was the reason I knew this would be big before it was but the sub isn't what it used to be after heavy brigading). People were genuinely scared of videos and stories coming out of China about people dropping dead in the street and being welded into their apartments. It was something that initially was worth taking very seriously for self preservation. I will admit that I was one of the "we're two weeks behind Europe" people at first. However, by the end of March/ early April, it became evident that despite most people crowding into grocery stores and other places and not really taking the lockdown seriously (before they spun propaganda making it "virtuous" to wear a mask and social distance - a manipulative term I hate - and evil, selfish, unintelligent, and killing grandma with no regard for life to not blindly accept these measures), no one was really getting sick or dying in mass amounts. I never got tested, never will unless I'm laying there dying and it's medically necessary which I don't believe will happen, but I definitely believe I returned from a work trip to NYC in early March with the virus. Had low level flu symptoms and chills for a week and a half or so. My symptoms went away and I haven't noticed any lasting effects. Like many of us, I played it safe in March and waited for more empirical evidence to surface, trying to look past the eventual propaganda and political campaigns. It became evident that numbers are being manipulated, goalposts are moved continually as people are gaslit into accepting more and more mandates and shunning/ criticizing those who question them, and "flatten the curve" turned into none of us have any idea when we'll be allowed to earn a living again. It became self- evident that the end doesn't justify the means and politicians have gone off the rails trying to exaggerate things to keep their emergency powers.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning, I’m surprised everyone has been taking the media and government so seriously 😐 Like dose anyone seriously believe that a giant government corporation cares about you people dying? Or your health!? 1st world country with no universal healthcare, high birth mortality, no liability for vaccines distributors, Our men in America are pre registered for the draft!!! Like... now you care!? </p>
<p>Plus they (media and gov) are not medical experts by any stretch of the imagination, all they do is cite their own sources, which is fine....but closed minded.... the other side of this argument is not addressed in any serious or compassionate matter at all. </p>
<p>Which is very “unscientific” in itself. 
Just gaslighting / bullying and buzz words. </p>
<p>But whatever........ I can go on forever:/</p>

        <p>The firt sign that something was off was when I saw a blog post that said that 80% of deaths were people over age 65. The article went on to state that like 50% occured in <strong>nursing homes</strong> and that only under 1% were under age 35. It was very clear that deaths were clustered in a mall subpopulation, but we decided to lock down the entire world—livelihoods be damned.</p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel's back was my governor (Jay Inslee, Washington), rolling back re-opening because # of daily cases was rising. The % of positive test was constant though, so it was clearly due to increased testing (which is a good thing!). I'm a data scientist by trade—this is an asinine, rookie data mistake. The fact that his statisticians and epidemiologist let him use it as justification for a policy changed killed a lot of my faith in their ability to handle the situation.</p>

        <p>I was a bit skeptical from the very beginning, I’m naturally skeptical of everything the government says. I certainly wasn’t worried about catching the virus myself, given my younger age and how healthy I am. But definitely by the first half of April I realized what an overblown reaction it was.</p>

        <p>When I read a headline that said “Americans should be prepared to have their way of life severely disrupted.” This was after watching what was happening in Italy. </p>
<p>I’ve been considerable time in Italy. Their socialized medical structure is salivated over by Americans who’ve barely left their state, let alone experienced actual life in another country. While the Italian healthcare system is decent in the north, I wasn’t surprised to see them struggle given their very dense, old population and a society built around extreme closeness. I kept thinking “their situation can’t possibly be applied to the whole US, maybe Chicago and NYC but why would need this reaction in a place like Phoenix or Denver where there’s a hospital on practically every block.” I just could not grasp why we wouldn’t try to keep as much going like normal.</p>
<p>I attended a music festival packed with people the weekend before the US proverbially shutdown aka everything started being cancelled. I couldn’t believe I didn’t hear fuck all about safety precautions at that festival then a week later was told I would definitely kill 20 people if I breathed outside. That’s when it really all came crumbling down. We were being played and controlled.</p>
<p>Everyone around me started freaking out but I was freaking out for another reason. Watching everything I lived for be taken, watching my social friends just say “oh well” when I asked what they would do if this went on forever. Watching my 60+ parents still go to work in very public places and be fine while people around them cowered. Worrying about my 60+ parents and their job security and retirement knowing I will never be able to help them given what I make. Knowing it was all forced. Knowing how much forced and deliberate poverty this will cause and listening to all the spoiled white anarcho-communists say we deserve it and using this as a front to try and usher in communism. It just fucked me off so badly. </p>
<p>Then the protests started and I wanted to obliterate everyone. We were fucking played and now only the protected special class gets to live life and band together in ass to stomach crowds while they tell the rest of us we are murderers. I hope hell is real because a whole lot of people just got their 1 way tickets.</p>

        <p>I remember the exact day. It was late March a couple weeks into the shut down, or "shelter in place" a term which previously I had only heard in relation to a refinery leak in the Bay Area. When that was first ordered in California, school was cancelled, sports and events cancelled, the stores were like a war zone with half empty shelves... I spent a couple days in bed, crying and terrified for my family. My husband and I sat down with our adult daughter and made sure she had access to our wills and financial documents and we asked her to take custody of our minor son if we both died of this virus.</p>
<p>I had an online subscription to the WAPO and it was constant terror, doom and gloom, stories of young people dying, predictions of bodies in the streets. Gov. Newsom said half of California would get this and 2 million would die if we didn't ACT NOW! I was all in- we needed to "flatten the curve" and I sure wanted to protect my family from this scary, deadly virus! But my anxiety was at an all time high, and also depression, which I had never experienced before. Then came the day in March when the WAPO ran two articles and I just snapped. One article was a first person account of a woman who was pregnant and "scared" about giving birth and maybe getting the virus. She didn't have it, it was just her fears and worries - what was newsworthy about that? The other article was titled "The Coronavirus Could Wipe Out Humans' Closest Relatives". And it was all just unscientific speculation. No primates had gotten the virus that we knew of, let alone died from it, but the article quoted a couple scientists who said "It COULD happen."</p>
<p>And it all just clicked with me. I thought - I don't understand what is happening here, but the news media is clearly trying to manipulate the pubic, and I refuse to let that happen to me. I deleted all my news apps, stopped watching TV and started seeking out other information. I found lots of doctors and experts questioning the mainstream narrative about the virus and the lockdowns (Ioniddas, Swiss Policy Research) and later Alex Berenson and this sub. I stopped being scared and started getting angry. Still working on not letting that anger consume me daily.</p>

        <p>The bit about having a sit-down with your daughter and talking about your will reminds me of my mom. Back in April, she claimed to be "paranoid" about the virus, said she couldn't stop watching the news, told me about her will for the umteenth time, etc. All she wanted to talk about on Easter was the virus. When I told her it's only really a danger to people much older and unhealthier than her, she yelled "Haven't you been watching the news?!" even though she knows I don't listen to those assholes. Told me all these horror stories of friends of friends of friends of friends getting so horribly sick.</p>
<p>She was over it by May. Anti-mask and anti-lockdown for the most part, though she still thinks everything will go back to normal soon. Just like 9/11.</p>

        <p>I was vehemently against the lockdown policies from the moment I first heard of the idea. As for the actual disease, I always figured the high case fatality rates were exaggerated compared to the true infection fatality rate, but over the winter I was expecting the actual infection fatality rate to be more like 1% rather than the fraction of 1% figures that were revealed by spring. That, however, was only interesting to me as a curiosity and as a way to find out what precautions, if any, would be reasonable for me to take in my own life. I have always thought that lockdown policies and imposing these restrictions were horrible ideas both morally and practically no matter how high the death rate was.</p>

        <p>I bought into the fraud in January, following Twitter videos from China, figured out by  February that this was going to be a thing, by March I followed the #filmyourhospital and then the Tik Tok videos sealed the deal.</p>

        <p>Honestly I was kind of skeptical from day one. My mom is a nurse. She thought it was ridiculous, and still does. But I think when it truly got killed for me was when there was a press release of medical officials saying that BLM protests weren’t dangerous but that lockdown protests were. Masks or no masks, mass gatherings are dangerous or they’re not. You can’t pick and choose based on whatever political agenda you might have.</p>

        <p>I’m a fairly right-leaning libertarian. I remember all the way back at the beginning when it was actually the right making a big deal about the virus: restricting travel, prepping, wearing masks. I had a lot of friends doing this, but I never took it seriously. The left, on the other hand, were trying to make it look like no big deal, discouraging masks, calling people racists for social distancing from Chinese people, etc. </p>
<p>I am, at core, a non-interventionist. I think for there to be a top-down intervention, there needs to be undeniable truth that it is warranted and that it will not have any significant deleterious side effects, nor restrict personal liberty seriously. So, against most of my friends, I had more of an attitude of waiting and watching what happens, without any drastic interventions, other than being more cognizant of hygiene and avoiding sick people. I watched as the narrative shifted several times, with the left eventually calling for drastic interventions and shutting everything down, as well as many on the right.</p>

        <p>I never took it super seriously from the beginning, but I did judge people who were still traveling at the end of March. By the beginning of April, I fully realized that the lockdowns were way overhyped. We were told 2 weeks at first. Then everything kept getting pushed back. Every time Trump said something, people would freak out and demand longer shutdowns. I was hopeful in April that schools would reopen in mid-May, like we were told initially but then schools were just cancelled without another thought and I was like "well, shit...this isn't going away"</p>
<p>Then I was really hopeful when the governor of my state moved to Phase 2 on May 22. And then the riots started the end of May and I wondered if people would move on from COVID. Nope...back to fear mongering in June. Now it is August and I just read a comment from someone in the bachelor subreddit that if Biden gets elected, then masks will be mandated beginning in January and we will all have to wear masks for a long time. So now I just think we are fucked and I am hoping that Trump wins the election (never thought I would say that but here we are). And my state has been stuck in phase 2 since May 22 and I keep hearing is "well, if people would just wear masks and follow the rules, this would be over."</p>

        <p>My instinct told me from the very start that people were overreacting. It just seemed... too extreme, too weird to be true. From past experience, I’ve learnt that when something is radical and far-fetched but technically <em>could</em> be true, it isn’t true. So I was extremely sceptical. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. And my instinct was right.</p>

        <p>It wasn't sudden for me. I was extremely worried at first. My parents are in their 70's. I began to mentally prepare for them to die because from the coverage of the virus it seemed like a reasonable possibility. In March I totally believed what was happening. I knew the media exaggerated but I never thought they would play around with something as serious as this. </p>
<p>Throughout April and May I expected things to take a turn for the worse, and they did, but cases and deaths were nowhere near the projections. It was starting to not make sense. Projections were off by orders of magnitude. The projections changed every few weeks, always lowering the predicted number of deaths. Even these new projections have turned out unbelievably wrong.</p>
<p>Then the George Floyd protests happened and covid was forgotten. People who were protesting by the thousands were portrayed positively even though they greatly outnumbered the anti-lockdown protesters who had been vilified. What really sealed it for me was seeing coverage of doctors protesting for racial justice. Like there were groups of 100+ doctors kneeling and marching. If covid was truly so dangerous and widespread, if hospitals were truly struggling, how did all these doctors find the time to protest and how could they justify risking the spread of coronavirus to the community?</p>

        <p>From the very beginning. I remember watching the news when we were first contemplating lockdowns. There were only a few hundred cases in the U.S. at the time and I thought it was insane to shut down the whole country at that point. I was more worried that the government knew more than they were letting on and that there virus was much more lethal than they were telling us than anything else because the case numbers and the death rate they were putting out in mid-March just didn't seem to justify their actions. Obviously, that turned out not to be the case and here we are.</p>

        <p>Here's my timeline:</p>
<p><strong>Some time in February</strong>: I first hear about the virus.  And I immediately dismiss it completely. "Oh boy, it's the latest over-hyped scary disease du jour -- Zika, Ebola, SARS, MERS, swine flu, bird flu, porcupine flu, mad cow disease, hungry hippo disease, etc., etc. Shut the fuck up. I don't care." </p>
<p><strong>Early March</strong>: I remember finding <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/02/29/coronavirus-emerging-numbers-provide-reasons-for-c.aspx">this article</a> after the media had started to get me a <em>little</em> spooked. ("I know they're <em>probably</em> overhyping this thing like they've done with every other new disease, but maybe this one time they're actually not full of shit.") And then I read it and was like "oh, ok, no, they're full of shit this time too."</p>
<p><strong>Mid- to late-March</strong>: The lockdowns started and I was like "well damn, maybe it IS a lot worse than it first appears. Maybe the government knows something about this virus that they're not telling us. Maybe it was engineered as a bio-weapon and does something awful."</p>
<p><strong>Early- to mid-April</strong>: It seemed like every day that passed it became more and more obvious that this virus was not nearly as bad as it was initially made out to be. And I thought, "well, the government must have had bad information. They massively overreacted but now that that's clear they'll reverse course soon."</p>
<p><strong>Late April to present</strong>: But they didn't. Indeed, as it was becoming ever clearer that the initial restrictions had been a massive overreaction, they actually continued doubling down on them. And I realized: "oh shit, there's some <em>serious</em> fuckery afoot here." And now <em>that</em> becomes more undeniable every day.</p>

        <p>March 24th. Quickly ran the numbers, and the exponential rate was decreasing before the lockdown. Whatever we were doing before - social distancing and hand hygeine - was having an affect greater than the lockdowns ever did.</p>

I could not understand why the government was locking down the entire population and preventing kids from going to school, rather than focusing on protecting the vulnerable.

        <p>From the start. Back in December or so I tried out Alex Jones and he was the first one talking about it. I bought two months or so of food just to be safe and give him a chance. After all he's a crazy conspiracy theorist right?</p>
<p>Well then the world turned to shit, I haven't listened to Alex in a while, but back when lockdowns started happening I got into a fight or 7 with my management about staying open, but we got shut down and I've been livid ever since. I haven't seen this as any more than a government overstep from the beginning.</p>

        <p>November or December:</p>
<p>Hear about a novel virus in China. We called it "Kung flu in my pharmacy". Found out it's a coronavirus. So high chance of a cold, low chance of SARS 2.</p>
<p>Not particularly concerned.</p>
<p>February: heat the stories coming out of Italy. Somewhat concerned. Look at the demographics - a bunch of old smokers from the region of Europe with the worst air pollution. Yep, it's a cold. Just a new virus that the elderly haven't had a chance to get when they were young and their immune systems were ready.</p>
<p>Tragic, but locking down Italy was silly.</p>
<p>Early studies showed some promising drug treatments. Two weeks later Trump said it was good and all the news pivoted hard to against the promising drugs.</p>
<p>That was when I knew it was time to stop listening to the news.</p>

        <p>I stopped giving a shit about lockdowns when BLM protests were deemed safe while anti-lockdown protests were not. It was also added in that anti-lockdown protests were bad because they had "roots in nationalism" or something along those lines.</p>

        <p>I remember when the BLM protests started there were many people slandering the anti lockdown protests by comparing images of signs saying “ I want a haircut “ with BLM ones and how selfish they were for wanting to go out.

        <p>I knew things were going to go south back in February. I started making sure I had a full freezer, our dog food supply was up, etc. Then the shit hit the fan quickly. We had an 80 person baby shower on Saturday and by Monday schools were closing. Because I was quite pregnant, I took it seriously for about a month. I wouldn’t let people in my house and didn’t want anyone touching my dogs bc i was convinced the virus would transfer. Did the whole grocery wiping thing. I avoided my parents who live nearby and refused to visit my sister in an apartment building. I always knew in the back of my head that it wasn’t going to go away though. Lockdowns were pointless because people would just get sick once they got out and about again. When I started looking at the numbers and realized not everyone on that cruise ship tested positive, I started to question it. Then I learned someone at my shower actually had COVID and nobody else got sick. Wait, what?! According to the news shouldn't at least half the group be so sick they can’t move and a handful dead?! Then my dad’s friend was exposed to his brother actively sick with COVID but mysteriously remained healthy. Found LDS back when they had under 4000 members and the rest is history.</p>

        <p>Fact is, it just isn't as infectious as they say it is. More infectious than flu? Seems so. But 100x more infectious, which is what the media and government would have you believe? No, not at all.</p>
<p>My dad cared for my mother for 3 weeks while she had it (she recovered without any intervention) and he never got it. My housemate was sick with it for two weeks and I never got it. <em>And so on</em>.</p>
<p>The estimates that without strict lockdowns 80% of people would be infected have been widely disproven by multiple studies. More damningly, they were disproven by early March when there were those outbreaks on cruise ships and only 1 in 5 people got infected on average.</p>

        <p>I took the red pill when all the state governors pulled out their reopening plans. All of them basically says "we will not reopen until a vaccine in fall 2021" which is unrealistic because by the time falls 2021 comes all small businesses, large event group, and conventions will be out of business.</p>
<p>Then their behavior made it clear that these have nothing to do with vaccines: They want a bailout so they can funnel money to their administrations while residents get the scraps.</p>

        <p>The moment my company started working from home, and my boss told me it might end up being long-term. </p>
<p>Quick backtrack: I was born prematurely and got sick all the time as a kid. Nonetheless, I still somehow managed to develop disease-focused OCD when I was about 10 or 11. I went through therapy and it worked extremely well. The OCD didn’t go away or anything — the disorder doesn’t work that way — but I stopped being terrified of getting sick. The only part of my germaphobia that remained was hand washing. And a lot of it. Otherwise, my OCD had moved on to give me different sorts of irrational fears. In therapy, I was taught to not be afraid of stuff like AIDS or SARS. My dad added that the media blows everything out of proportion, and taught me how to read headlines critically so I didn’t panic. </p>
<p>Fast-forward: I’ve just graduated college with a CS degree and I’m doing coding for a TV company. Barely watch the news, too busy and not really interested in that stuff. I’m vehemently pro-vax, so I <em>did</em> think that covid was something we needed to be careful about, but figured that the media would blow it out of proportion just like they do with most things. </p>
<p>Lockdown was a shock, because I didn’t watch the news at all, so I had no idea it was coming. I still have never seen the footage of Italy at its worst. I thought lockdown was an overreaction, but I was fine with it when it was first mentioned — because it was only supposed to be two weeks! But when my boss told me we could be working from home for up to 6 months, when the entire internet became doom and gloom and everyone stopped caring about mental health, I knew things were going to get ugly. </p>
<p>Cue depression relapse (had depression in middle/high school and throughout much of college). Found LockdownSkepticism which honestly saved me during that time. By Memorial Day, almost everything in my state was open, and I thought things would be back to normal. But then I lost my job on June 1st due to a company-wide budget cut, and now I’m just wondering when it’s all going to end.</p>

        <p>About 2 weeks after the start of the lockdown here in CA.    At that point it was prettty clear that this was a bit worse than a bad seasonal flu, but not world-destroying, and people needed to wash their hands and stop picking their noses.</p>
<p>Everything else was just histrionic bullshit attention-seeking and political maneuvering.   You could <em>see</em> the Democratic party machine processing the possiblity of using this to affect the November election: "how can we keep the economy, which was booming, from recovering?"     And Trump just won't calm down and shut up a little.</p>

<p>I knew before the lockdowns that the mood in the UK was causing people to overreact. When the lockdown happened, I was sure. I found out about Event 201 in February, so I realised that this was no "ordinary" outbreak. </p>
<p>Soon after the lockdowns, I saw Bill Gates on TV telling us that life only goes back to normal when the global population is vaccinated. That was the moment when the depths of the evil revealing itself became clear. Immediately after, I found out that that he funded the research which generated the bullshit projected death figures, and directly lead to the lockdowns. I then reminded myself of the various agendas that he has been quietly funding over the years(which I used to look into), and looked at what my preferred news sources in the independent media were saying. </p>
<p>So I knew there was something afoot, but in March, my understanding of what is unfolding strengthened. When it became clear that the death figures in several countries are bullshit, there was no doubt in my mind that this is some kind of internationally orchestrated transformative event, possibly a secret UN programme.</p>
<p>This is a controlled demolition of thr global economy to usher in a long intended international fascistic technocratic surveillance state with "global health" as the Trojan horse for its installation.</p>

        <p>Honest to god, it was in early March — the very first time I saw the phrase “the new normal.” One of the higher-ups at my job was using it in a division-wide email about the new remote working policy, and something just...felt off about it. How the hell did he know whether or not this was the “new normal?” What was he even referring to, exactly? At this point, the statewide and national dialogs were about the possibility of a two-week lockdown and that was it. It just felt, somehow, like he was using a term that shouldn’t have realistically been in common usage for at least another few weeks or more. A term that he had been fed. </p>
<p>From that point on, I was hyper aware of the possibility that this was a concentrated effort by those in charge and very much not about the science or the public’s best interests. IMO, I was completely right.</p>

        <p>When I first heard of the virus making rounds in China, I was....ambivalent. On one hand, the media seems heavily invested in hyping up tensions between the US and China, nevermind the ebola scare and zika scare that turned out not to be the apocalypse, but on the other hand, we are due for a genuinely serious pandemic one of these days. Pandemics are just another force of nature, like earthquakes and hurricanes. What if this really was The Big One folks are crossing their fingers for? I remember several people back in late February or early March predicting millions dead in just a couple weeks. What if they were right?</p>
<p>Still, I was much more worried about how governments and corporations might take advantage of the crisis. Deadly as any terrorist attack or natural disaster may be, many more lives and livelihoods across multiple generations are lost to our corrupt leaders and their power-grabbing shenanigans, a prime example being the post-9/11 police powers that still haven't really been dialed back after almost 20 years. Post-COVID is shaping up to be even worse. In particular, contact tracing and targeted quarantines are much more worrisome to me than the thought of broad sweeping lockdowns because....well....they're more targeted. Sorry, but I would rather our masters try to lock down everyone than just focus on me and my family. I'd like to think they lack the resouces to imprison millions and billions of people. Yes  I'm a selfish coward.</p>
<p>As news came out of Italy, I briefly grew more worried about the virus itself. Until it became clear how the majority of deaths were elderly people with underlying medical conditions and/or living in an overcrowded environment. Tragic, yes, but not an apocalyptic plague. The real plague is the mass hysteria, the overreacting media, the overreaching policies of governments and corporations dick-in-hand with each other. With each passing month, with each passing week, this only grows more painfully obvious. Obvious to some people, at least.</p>
<p>When so many people were crying "bioweapon!" earlier this year, the contrarian in me disagreed. As I said before, pandemics are natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes; the Black Death wasn't some bioweapon concocted in a medieval laboratory just because corrupt leaders took advantage of the crisis. Besides, why design such a mild bioweapon? And contrary to what many trolls here think of us, I certainly don't believe the virus is a complete hoax either, that's like saying 9/11 was nothing more than an elaborate psyop and over 2000 "dead" people were put in witness protection. Still though, the timing of Event 201 last year and the ID2020 initiative have me very very suspicious of the current narrative.</p>

        <p>February 2020. when I saw the videos of Chinese people dropping dead in the streets I told my whole family that this was a hoax.   Last week I reminded my mom about this and asked her "why are people not dropping dead anywhere else anymore? " but she doesn't listen,  too busy calculating her risk factor.</p>

        <p>I supported a 2-week lockdown in March, while it seemed that the virus killed 10% of people. At the time, I fully expected life to be back to normal by June. As soon as the lockdown didn't end after the promised 2 weeks despite increasing evidence that the virus wasn't as deadly as first thought, I changed my mind.</p>

        <p>Probably when the government started shutting down travel in New Zealand back in March. I could see a lockdown was coming and I was right. I'd already looked at the data and concluded it was mainly elderly and very sick dying so the intensity of the government's response absolutely stunk like hell. I initially thought it was some kind of NWO takeover thing but I've since concluded its likely just a huge self sustaining mass of hot air from opportunistic politicians wanting votes, big biz wanting to consolidate power, scientists and media wanting money.</p>

        <p>Honestly always sceptical from the get go.  I remember how in early 2000s SARS was going to kills us all.  Then Foot and Mouth. Then avian flu and swine flu.  And yet despite what the media tried to peddle there were no mass graves and world collapse.  So I presumed the same of covid from the start, just more media scaremongering over a virus thats actually relatively harmless.  Just never figured this time they would get it snowballing successfully.</p>
<p>Then early on there was a news report of a young woman, 20 or so, the picture of health apparently with zero underlying health problems who caught covid and died within days.  However from her picture it appeared (and I am just guessing here so i accept I may be wrong) that despite looking like she was in pretty good health and shape she had that sort of slightly gaunt look that anorexic or recovered anorexic people tend to have.  I didn't believe her death was because of covid at all in part because of what i mentioned and lo and behold later on it came out in the wash that she had in fact died of a heart attack and it had just been labelled as covid because she had had a cough a week or so earlier. Although still it was pushed that it must have somehow been covid because she was healthy etc. Exept for those who don't know eating disorders can tend to put great strain on people's organs, such as hearts, and can result in things such as... heart attacks.  No other virus etc needed.</p>
<p>Now as i said she may not have had an eating disorder but either way she never actually died of covid but the media leapt on it regardless and tried to drum up fear that it would strike down any who got it, young or old, healthy or not.  That was another major tipping point to me that it was all super overblown because they had to focus so much on something that was totally false whereas if the virus really was so deadly they would have a hundred cases of young and healthy people killed by covid.</p>
