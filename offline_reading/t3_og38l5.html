    <strong>Query about how UK "Cases" are counted, if only a lateral flow test is used, and no confirming PCR test afterwards?</strong>
    <p><p>On the UK government coronavirus data website <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases">https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases</a> the following text about how cases are counted is displayed:</p>
<p>====================================</p>
<p>Cases by specimen date</p>
<p><em>Number of people with at least one positive COVID-19 test result, either lab-reported or rapid lateral flow test (England only), by specimen date.</em> <strong><em>Positive rapid lateral flow test results can be confirmed with PCR tests taken within 72 hours. If the PCR test results are negative, these are not reported as cases.</em></strong> <em>People tested positive more than once are only counted once, on the date of their first positive test. Data for the period ending 5 days before the date when the website was last updated with data for the selected area, highlighted in grey, are incomplete.</em></p>
<p>====================================</p>
<p>I have a query about the text I've highlighted in <strong><em>Bold-Italic.</em></strong> I want to know what happens in the circumstance where a person has a positive lateral flow test, but does not take a follow up PCR test either at all, or within the 72 hour timeframe.</p>
<p>The text makes it clear that if a follow up PCR test taken withing 72 hours and is negative, that disconfirms the positive lateral flow test and is not counted as a case, BUT, careful reading implies to me that if a person does <strong>not</strong> take the follow-up PCR test they are still counted in the statistics as a positive case, on just the positive lateral flow test alone.</p>
<p>Given the unreliability of the lateral flow test, this surely has to inflate the case numbers</p></p>
