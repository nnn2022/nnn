    <strong>Do we agree that the solid majority of people are just people who want the best for themselves and the people around them?</strong>
    <p><p>I've lurked this sub for a while, and many others on different spectrums of views. I've finally commented (and yes I've been automatically banned from sibreddits I don't remember visiting).</p>
<p>Do we all agree that there are groups of people who make things difficult for others, but the majority of people are just trying to live their best lives? I'm not talking about politicians, though even politicians I think are generally--though not always--try to do what seems best, though in the context of pandering to their largest voting base, whatever it is or whatever they think it is. </p>
<p>I'm fully vaccinated, so is my spouse, we were first in line when we could be, which was around April. I was hesitant about this one--I am far from anti-vaccine--so I read what I could and decided I'd rather get the shot. I have a toddler, and I'm more concerned about kids' immune responses, so I won't vaccinate her until far down the line when there is more information, if I do. She is otherwise fully up to date on other vaccines. I had full faith in my own immune system to handle the COVID vaccine just like it would probably handle the virus if I got it. Turned out just so.</p>
<p>I wore masks when everyone requested me to, and logically it makes sense that masks will prevent my coughing and sneezing from getting far away from me. I wasn't caughing and sneezing, but some people were, and sure let's all wear the masks, I don't care. After the vaccine, I didn't wear a mask unless specifically requested by the establishment. Most people around me did the same.</p>
<p>This is basically everyone I meet. Yes I've been yelled at by some lady on a hike to put our masks on and we just had to walk away, and yes I've seen someone cause a scene at a 16-year-old serving ice cream for meekly asking them to please put on a mask because that's the rules. I tipped him extra because my God, can't we take it out on someone else?</p>
<p>I strongly feel like I'm in the majority. Those who are angry about something, one way or the other, and take it out loudly (hopefully not violently but it happens), are much more opinionated on the matter than most. Is that the case, or do you disagree?</p></p>

        <p>I never know what people mean when they say "leftist", do you mean people who are not conservative politically, or Marxist communist types?</p>
<p>Not sure what immigration has to do with much of it, immigrants can't vote until they're naturalized and there doesn't seem to be much of a political leaning among those who are, they're about as evenly split as the rest of the natural citizens overall.</p>

        <p>Isn't that most people? Because I agree wholeheartedly. Make the best decisions that you can and do what you think is best to ensure the best life you can have for yourself and those close to you, and everyone else can and should do the same. Most people aren't rallying for vaccines or against them, most people aren't rallying for or against masks; most people just want to do what's best for them and leave others alone.</p>
<p>Am I in a bubble? Is it extremely common to be accosted to do one thing or another? I know that strong-minded people are out there, but I can't see the extreme vitriol to either side in real life.</p>

        <p>I have a lot of “friends” on social media who posted extreme vitriol on the doomer authoritarian side nonstop over the last year. I snoozed a ton of people on Facebook last year because they wouldn’t shut the flying fuck up about masks.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s the internet, but these are real people who I actually know, which makes me think it goes beyond anonymous Reddit. I have also had multiple “friends” try to bully me into getting the vaccine (in real life) when I made it very clear that I don’t want to.</p>
<p>I also have REAL friends who got the vaccine, but they don’t care if I do or not. That’s their personal decision and I have no problem with it. As long as they afford me the same respect we’re all good.</p>

        <p>I have friends who didn't get the vaccine and literally never will (that is, they are against all vaccines in general). I kind of laughed when, after I told them we got the shot, they said, "yeah we won't if that's OK". No shit. I know of all people you wouldn't, still here aren't I? </p>
<p>As long as we're all respectful of each other, godspeed. As long as we're truthful with each other, we can make our own decisions. I really genuinely believe that's most people - most people I meet who probably aren't on social media furiously posting about something or the other. We went on a jet boat ride yesterday, of course no one wearing masks, most people aren't local, and it's just... It's just people doing their thing, having fun. Probably the same people who wore masks 6 months ago just like we did, without really caring that much. I saw some people with masks on in the gift shop, and I don't know why they chose to have them on, but it's fine!</p>
<p>We made friends on that boat ride and covid talk is like weather talk nowadays. People just chat and move on. I feel like things I read on the internet is a minority.</p>

        <p>Huh. I guess I may be in a bubble after all. I know there are people out there who believe strongly one way or another, but overall I saw no animosity in person. I live in a town with a large senior population, and everyone wore masks without protesting, then vaccines became available, and then people dropped the masks, including the seniors. It just seemed exactly like I would have expected it to go.</p>

        <p>People generally don't give a darn about their fellow men (sounds harsh but its true). We pretend we care but when it comes down to it we are more concerned with our own selfish needs. Most would not put their lives in danger to save another. Wearing a mask is a low-effort/risk activity. It's easy to virtue signal that you care for others when you dont have to put your money where your mouth is. For instance when someone gets beat-up most bystanders wouldnt intervene out of fear of getting hurt. It's just human nature: self-preservation, most people are conformists and cowardly. It's not meant as an insult but just highlighting the less flattering aspects of humans.</p>
<p>Do you really think a cotton cloth will prevent a virus from spreading. Virusses are around 1 nanometer. Do you know how big the spaces are between cotton threads? In comparison to the virus size they are HUGE. The ear we breath out contains moist which passes through the mask. So how is it that masks work? It's total bullshit if you use logic. But common sense seems not to common anymore.</p>
<p>I dont get your logic. You say you trust your body to handle the virus but you went and got the shot anyways. That's some mental gymnastics you performed.</p>

        <p>&rt;People generally don't give a darn about their fellow men (sounds harsh but its true). We pretend we care but when it comes down to it we are more concerned with our own selfish needs.</p>
<p>I completely agree with this and I think it's OK. Is it not OK? I don't want strangers to suffer, but I will not go completely out of my comfort to provide comfort to them. Minor things, sure. </p>

<p>Is it less flattering, or just common sense? I think it's common sense. If children are beating on another child, I will intervene; if adults are beating on another adult, the best I can do is call for help, because otherwise I'm just adding to the casualties. </p>

<p>I don't think that viruses can't spread through cloth at all. But if I sneeze or cough, I think that the mask can contain the water droplets  to a smaller area. How is that not common sense? That's all I've ever imagined masks could do, and I can't see how it can't do exactly that. </p>
<p>&rt;I dont get your logic. You say you trust your body to handle the virus but you went and got the shot anyways. That's some mental gymnastics you performed.</p>
<p>All of the side effects from the shot were the same side effects from covid itself based on my research. If I can probably handle the illness, I can therefore handle the shot. But having the shot gave me a piece of mind of not having to worry about possibly getting the virus itself, and therefore possibly dealing with a greater viral load making the same symptoms worse or lasting longer.</p>

        <p>That dude's breathing, and I don't think breath is being well contained by surgeon/cloth masks. I'm pretty convinced logically that water droplet type expenditure, like sneezing or caughing, is quite logically better contained in your mask, better than an elbow anyway. Doesn't spray everywhere. If we all agreed to only wear masks if we're sneezing and coughing, and no other times, that would also make perfect sense (I know that there are seasonal allergies, but don't we all assume it's allergies without knowing so for a fact?). Anyway.</p>

<p>It's really not that minority, it's the people in charge. I do think all politicians do what they think will get them reelected. Texas or Florida? No mandates, cheers from most. Washington or Oregon? Yes mandates, cheers from most. You and I can bitch about certain states, the federal this and the state that, all we want, and there will still be people who will disagree with both of us on all points. However, at this time, I think we should all agree that the overwhelming majority of people wasn't the one loudly screaming for one thing or the other. We just wanted to be happy.</p>

        <p>There are micro droplets you cant see with your eyes. But there are real nonetheless. Humans lose water by urinating, persperation, and exhaling. Therefore a virus that is transmitted via liquids should transmit with every breathe. </p>
<p>Concerning seasonal flu - there is no flu virus. The flu is nothing else than your body detoxing triggered by a change in weather temperature. That's why it's seasonal. The lungs get inflammated which starts the muccus production which battles the inflammation.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with your first paragraph, an airborne virus does travel with every breath - but it does make sense for it to go through farther when you're sneezing or caughing. And that's where masks logically help.</p>
<p>I don't understand your second paragraph. Are you really saying that influenza, the virus, just doesn't exist?</p>

        <p>No you are not in the majority. More people have refused the experimental shot than have taken it.  I am pissed that people will be dying and disabled from this experimental mix of chemicals. The covid virus is a cold virus. There is no cure or vaccine for the common cold. </p>
<p>Many people are simply lazy, they are sheep. They do what they are told. What research did you do? Exactly? I'm really curious.  Did you look up ingredients? Or did you just just believe the major media and the government? </p>
<p>Do you personally know anyone that dies from just covid without co-morbilities? Only 10 percent of the people (according to CDC stats) died from just the virus. That is a tenth of a percent of the population. The shot is much more dangerous.</p>

        <p>Nah the majority of the people who could, have taken the shot. Not some crazy overwhelming majority, but certainly well above 50%.</p>
<p>I researched what mRNA is, how those particular vaccines work, the history of them over the last couple of decades, and why these are the first mRNA vaccines for human use. I researched what kinds of side effects people in the trials, and anecdotally by then, had, and if any are unrelated to the disease itself. Of course more anecdotal stuff, related to people I know who had covid and recovered, and people I know who got the shot before me.</p>

        <p>How do you feel about the placebo in the trials being a meningitis shot instead of saline? How do you feel about the trials being “unblinded” after a few months and the control group being given the Covid shots? Seems like that would skew the side effects in favor of the vaccine.

        <p>&rt;How do you feel about the placebo in the trials being a meningitis shot instead of saline? </p>
<p>I just looked this up, seems like it was the British trials and it was to induce a general vaccine response so people don't assume that no reaction at all = placebo? I have absolutely no issues with any other vaccines at all, so I'm totally fine with this. I assume that the people who participated in the trials were informed that they may receive an existing vaccine as the "placebo group". </p>
<p>&rt;How do you feel about the trials being “unblinded” after a few months and the control group being given the Covid shots?</p>
<p>They had no choice. You can't prevent people from getting vaccinated if they want to be vaccinated. Certainly would've been ideal to include people who would've never gotten the shot but then it wouldn't be blind. </p>
<p>&rt;Seems like that would skew the side effects in favor of the vaccine. Especially considering this is the first time mRNA is used in a vaccine on humans.</p>
<p>Not sure I'm following. Also I saw that you edited the comment after I originally saw it. There are few people who died with no other underlying reason than "COVID" listed. Most had Covid and pneumonia listed - which makes sense, because covid does often lead to pneunomia. Others still had covid and heart inflammation/attack or stroke, which is a known complication as well, including even a known complication of immune responses to the vaccine as well. I recognize that there were some misatrributed covid deaths where someone died of a completely unrelated reason and happened to have covid at the same time, but those appear to be unusual and corrected promptly, which is why we've heard about them.</p>

        <p>I think individuals with empathy (which is most normal people in the day to day, otherwise we wouldn't have evolved civilization as far as we have) care, for their own community if not some backwater across the country, but there's a distinct group of oligarchs, propagandists, professional "activists", and State authoritarians who DON'T want what's best for everyone. In fact, most people's sense of decency is weaponized against them in that they are convinced to give up their money and personal sovereignty to a class that's already obscenely wealthy and powerful because it's the "decent" thing to do.</p>

        <p>I agree that generally most people do want to do “what’s right” and is the best for society as a whole. It’s a complex topic but one of the biggest problems I have is that different groups and media outlets are actively trying to mislead people throughout this entire pandemic. </p>
<p>For example, what percentage of people do you think heard that the cdc came out and updated their mortality rate to be around .2-.4%? Compared to what they were saying the majority of the time that it was around 2-3%. This was huge news and I only heard it here from this sub. </p>
<p>My problem wasn’t with the initial reaction, i think that was reasonable because there was so much we didn’t know. My problem was that they didn’t adjust anything as new information became available</p>

        <p>The way I see it--and you can disagree entirely--is that we had a new coronavirus which is unusual because most coronaviruses are mild. Then this one comes along and hospitals aren't equipped to handle the numbers nor do they know what to do with them.</p>
<p>Lock everything down, we have no hospital capacity left or almost there, before we figure this out. </p>
<p>Over time, we have a better idea on how to treat these cases, and vaccines seem effective enough. So no more lockdowns, we're OK. Is there any part of the US that is still under any crazy restrictions? Even Oregon opened back up in full.</p>
<p>That's sort of... What I would've expected?</p>
