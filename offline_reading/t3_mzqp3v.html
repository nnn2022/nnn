        <p>As a physician myself I applaud his bravery and doing the right thing. The defamation and censoring of honest physicians is evil on levels that rival the most egregious groupthink the world has seen.</p>

        <p>I have wanted to ask a doctor, but dont want to get on bad terms with my current one.  Do doctors get in trouble or sanctioned for giving a medical exemption for vaccines?</p>

        <p>Sure seems like it.  I've never known anyone who was able to get one.  It's all part of this one size fits all  approach to "healthcare".  Same thing with the vaccine. Your health conditions, your age, whether you're pregnant, &amp; whether you've had covid doesn't matter. They want everyone to have it. Usually dosage of medicine is determined by weight of a person. This isn't applied to any vaccine.</p>
<p>When discussing the possibility of vaccine passports, I love when people ask, "what if I can't get vaccines cause I have had problems in the past?" The answer is that the new normal dictates that you are not exempt, and nobody is going to be honest and tell you that you should skip this vaccine, not even your doctor. You are expected to sacrifice yourself for the greater good. You have to take responsibility for yourself and outright refuse.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about this last night.  If a doctor did say it was from vaccine, the health system where they work would probably be hearing from drug company.  Maybe loose funding and incentives?  Then, of course, that doctor would have to use his/her own time to write report and go to US vaccine court.....pretty much answered my question.  Not sure there are too many willing to risk career and livihood.  My guess is they would be destroyed just like those few brave doctors and scientists that are speaking out.  Not sure this can even be fixed.  It is just too risky for them.  What a disaster!</p>

        <p>Most places have a religious or philosophical exemption for vaccines, so people don’t really need letter from doctor.</p>
<p>It’s only those states where there are no religious/philosophical exemptions where this issue becomes really big. That’s why we really have to fight hard to keep those exemptions where we have them. California lost big a few years ago.</p>
<p>This is an ongoing fight, and really important.</p>

        <p>I agree need to continue to fight for all three.  You do need to personally sign a waiver for philosophical, only time you need a doctor is for medical.  Not as many states have philosophical, unfortunately</p>

        <p>&rt;He chose not to inject himself.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. Hoffe reports that the result of injecting 900 people among the indigenous First Nations community was that 2 people went into anaphylactic shock, one person died, and several others have suffered what appear to be permanent disabilities. He relates how one of his patients is in so much pain now, that she prefers death to life. By contrast, no one in the community died or became permanently disabled due to the COVID-19 virus for the past year.</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>&rt; They forbade him from saying anything negative about the Moderna shots by issuing a gag order against him.</p>

<p>\&rt;Hoffe also claimed that the death of a 72-year-old patient with COPD, 24 days after the man was vaccinated, was “presumed” to be vaccine-induced. The physician did not produce any evidence to prove that any of the events resulted from the vaccine.</p>
<p>So, according to the official method of counting covid deaths, this would be a covid death if the man had covid and not the vaccine.</p>
<p>\&rt;“It has been a challenge for us to investigate this thoroughly and take reports seriously,” says Dr. Carol Fenton, Medical Health Officer with IH. In a written statement issued on April 14, Fenton says that “There have been no deaths or lasting adverse reactions connected to the Moderna/Pfizer vaccines, or any COVID-19 vaccine, in Lytton, Interior Health, or B.C. at this time.”</p>
<p>So, without investigating...or "take reports seriously", they know the man didn't die from the vaccine? They aren't even thinking of investigating and then say there is no evidence.</p>
<p>And there you go. Covid is a thing and the vaccine is not, because covid was determined to be a thing and the vaccine was not, based on power and control.</p>

        <p>If anything, they got off lightly. You hear of retirement homes where like 20% coincidentally die from vaccine coincidence. Coincidence is the leading cause of death there, I guess.</p>
