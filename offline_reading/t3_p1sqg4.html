    <strong>Techniques of Recognizing Censorship and Countering It</strong>
    <p><p>Hope this proves useful for someone, somewhere. It is an academic view of censorship and the Streisand effect online. </p>
<p>Reference document:  <a href="https://documents.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/pubs/04pjr.html">Exposing and opposing censorship: backfire dynamics in freedom-of-speech struggles (uow.edu.au)</a> </p>
<p><strong>From the Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Many people support free expression and react against censorship as a violation of a valued social norm. </p>
<p>This reaction can be lessened in five main ways: </p>
<p>a. covering up the censorship, </p>
<p>b. devaluing the target, </p>
<p>c. reinterpreting the action as something other than censorship, </p>
<p>d. using official channels to give the appearance of fair play, and </p>
<p>e. intimidating or bribing participants in the struggle. </p>
<p>These methods of inhibition are often quite effective, but they can be countered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover-ups of censorship can be exposed through leaks, whistleblowing, and investigative journalism.</li>
<li>Devaluation of targets can be countered by arguing for the value of all people, by exposing double standards and by exposing the technique of devaluation.</li>
<li>Reinterpretation of actions can be challenged by making the case for the central importance of free expression. This is part of the ongoing struggle over meanings of events.</li>
<li>Use of official channels to create a false appearance of justice can be countered by exposing the failure, and sometimes the corruption, of official bodies. It can also be used as a rallying point to refocus people's attention on issues of justice and fairness.</li>
<li>Intimidation can be opposed by refusing to be intimidated; and both intimidation and bribery can be made to backfire by exposing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to fight back against censorship, spread this information around and use it to your advantage. Recognize that the person doing the censoring will use these techniques and you will need to use these techniques to avoid it going unnoticed.</p></p>
