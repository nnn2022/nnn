    <strong>Vaccines + TIA</strong>
    <p><p>My mum just got a TIA within a month of second dose. Is this common. Is anyone tracking it properly ? Obviously cant prove a link to vaccine but 
Im so angry. They have put so much pressure on us to take an experimental vaccine. Ive advised everyone to wait at least six months to a year.
Cant raise this issue with family obviously..noone wants to mention the vaccine in relation to this and I dont want to upset anyone. Most of my family got covid and vaccine. ( although my mum didnt get covid). 
Must say my family have been really respectful of my decision not to get vaccinated and Ive respected their decision and viewpoints also.
Im raging though with the idiots in power though who encourage people to take an experimental vaccine as the path towards normality and then indemnify the vaccine companies and dont even track the stats properly for signals of danger.
I just cant believe what is happening.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah but are they tracking it properly. Like if it is within a week is it counted, or a month or what ?
Is there a control group they can measure against statistically ?</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I hope your mum recovers well. If you're in the UK, the only tracking of adverse drug reactions is the MHRA Yellow Card system, which is a <strong>voluntary</strong> reporting system most people don't even know about. It's supposed to be an "early warning system", but regulators show little interest in investigating. If you're in the US, there's VAERs (not sure about other countries, sorry). You can search these databases to find how many people have reported similar reactions -- although it's thought only 1% of reactions are registered on VAERs. I think it's 10% on Yellow Card.</p>
<p>Also phase 3 safety trials haven't been completed yet:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04368728?term=NCT04368728&amp;rank=1&amp;view=results">Pfizer No Results Posted</a> (NRP) - May 2023   </li>
<li><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04516746?term=AZD1222&amp;draw=3&amp;rank=3">Astrazeneca - NRP</a> - Feb 2023   </li>
<li><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04470427?view=results">Moderna - NRP</a> - Oct 2022   </li>
<li><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT04614948?term=NCT04614948&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">J&amp;J - NRP</a> - May 2023 </li>
</ol>
<p>As a side note, my dad suddenly had severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and seizures around twelve days after his second AZ dose. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. The rest of my family and I know it was the injection; he says it's a coincidence. We registered the reaction on the Yellow Card system. There's no investigation or follow up.</p>

        <p>Thankyou, I am in Ireland. Its one of those things that could never be conclusively proven. To see if vax caused it,  it would have to be statistical data based on large numbers similarly matched people who have vs people who havent had the vax with big numbers in both sets. I dont think they are doing this though. From what I hear, they are not even doing " a triall " anymore as they are not interested in tracking the data. The government has waived liability so it is in noones interest to know really.
My mum is doing better now thanks. I hope your dad is doing ok too</p>
