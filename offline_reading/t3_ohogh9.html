        <p>It's racism.</p>
<p>White European civilization must be destroyed, before the UN and their New World Normal cronies can "Build Back Better".</p>
<p>Along with mass immigration to White European countries, and mainly from countries with idealogies that directly clash with those of the West, and like Canada - where they are encouraged to NOT assimilate and simply practice their culture - dilutes the core of the countries and changes them forever.</p>
<p>This is why all UK-origin countries 'the Commonwealth' have been hit hardest with lockdowns and restrictions - as those core tribes stand in the way of world domination.</p>

        <p>To be honest, much of US soil is just as much stolen land as the 2020 election was stolen from the American people.</p>

        <p>Anyone who feels that way is free to give their land, homes, cars, etc to Native Americans.  I promise you, they'll take it.</p>
<p>If you are White and feel that Black Americans are owed reparations...nothing is stopping you from giving them your shit.  But first I want to be compensated for the burnt down cities, lower property values, welfare for unwed mothers, and prisons.</p>
<p>So long as we're being "honest".</p>

<p>With historical events like the trail of tears, and the US government taking away land from the natives by force or by corrupt dealings, the acquisition of land is a dark part of US history along with slavery. The healthy thing to do is to acknowledge that evil that happened and learn from it, putting preventative measures in place to keep that from happening again. The unhealthy thing to do is to ignore it or to try punishing people of the present for the sins of people of the past.</p>
<p>&rt;If you are White and feel that Black Americans are owed reparations...nothing is stopping you from giving them your shit.  </p>
<p>That’s definitely true! It’s up to each individual to do what they are convicted in their heart to do.</p>
<p>&rt;But first I want to be compensated for the burnt down cities, lower property values, welfare for unwed mothers, and prisons.</p>
<p>Agreed. However, I think mere compensation or reparations isn’t enough. Corruption in politics needs to be a punishable offense, and our justice system should cease being bent and broken by money. If governors or mayors etc refrain from protecting a city from such wanton destruction, that should be an imprisonable offense. </p>
<p>&rt;So long as we're being "honest".</p>
<p>It’s good to be honest.</p>

<p>Look at the list (above) of the specific schools, locations, and other information.  Disgusting.  </p>
<p>You can't tell me that the majority of parents in Fayetteville AR are ok with this.  I looked up the teacher from Arkansas, she's got children's propaganda videos on YouTube and on her FB page she has a picture with her at a feminist rally and a gay marriage rally.</p>

        <p>"learn from it" is code for punishing people of the present for sins of the past.  </p>
<p>I'm so fucking tired of hearing how bad the White man is.  White men know how to do great things.  How about acknowledging that?</p>
<p>Native Americans sold other Native Americans out.  You don't take land without sellouts.  Maybe we do research and genetics testing and make those sellouts pay reparations to their own.</p>
<p>Africans sold Africans to White men.  You don't take slaves without sellouts. Maybe we do research and genetics testing and make those sellouts pay reparations to their own.</p>
<p>I promise, if I ever take slaves, I will make sure they are White leftists.</p>
