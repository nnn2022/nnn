        <p>So would this statement make their heads explode?</p>
<ul>
<li>"are we also gonna ignore the fact that nobody wears eye protection or gloves, so a mask is basically useless <em>ANYHOW</em> while ignoring every other form of PPE? <em>You wear a mask?</em> Who wiped down the door handle to the gas station, the CC machine, the counter, the gas pump, the kiosk where you order food. <em>You just hit 5 potential points of infection and think you are fine because you have on a mask.</em>"</li>

<p>Obligatory <strong>Masks are BS sources</strong> on a post about masks:</p>
<p>Stanford University just makes these masks to counteract oxygen deficiency for fun?</p>
<p>https://news.stanford.edu/2020/04/14/stanford-researchers-reengineer-covid-19-face-masks/</p>

        <p>The point of a mask isn't to protect the wearer, it's to protect those around them. The main way its spread is through water droplets that form when you cough, talk, sneeze etc which the mask catches.</p>

        <p>So when I blow vapor from a vape (very visible and much larger droplets - not like the ones you mention) through a mask and all the “droplets” go on through.

        <p>Okay so you’re really reaching because now you want to talk “proper PPE” so let’s say your delusion is right for the sake of your poor soul, we must all wear proper certified masks or at least 3 and continuously wash them, we also must wear goggles so the particles don’t pass through our eyes, and don’t forget to always wear and dispose of gloves consistently we must make sure every human on the planet does this and destroys their immune system in the process so that we all may be saved. It’s saddening to see how paranoid you are, however; I wonder if you were this precautious when TB took 20,000,000 lives? I wonder if you demanded this much? Or maybe, just maybe you’ve been psychologically overtaken through fear mongering displayed through your TV or phone in the means of flip flop rhetoric, hence why it’s so simple to destroy your logic. Just maybe....</p>

        <p>Wtaf are you talking about? I said masks don't protect the person wearing it, they protect the people around them, why are you now talking about PPE, gloves and goggles which protect the wearer. </p>
<p>In the UK around 350 people die of TB each year, the majority of TB deaths are in extremely poor areas of Asia and Africa where they don't have clean water, food or any healthcare. We also have a vaccine for TB so I don't know what your trying to prove.</p>

<p><em>this</em> is the real problem, fix this and you won't need vaccines, or masks.</p>
<p>And I'm not talking about "non-perishables" because <strong>nothing</strong> is non-perishable, it's either you or your food. These days, food is winning that battle.</p>

        <p>Plenty of evidence and studies that show masks are NOT effective at preventing people from contracting any respiratory virus. They can actually cause harm too:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32232837/">Most healthcare workers develop de novo PPE-associated headaches or exacerbation of their pre-existing headache disorders.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31289698/">Study showing inefficiency of cloth face masks and effects of washing and drying</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/">Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05">There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of face masks to reduce the risk of infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751/">Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.10720.pdf">Conversely, surgical and hand-made masks, and face shields, generate significant leakage jets that have the potential to disperse virus-laden fluid particles by several metres. The different nature of the masks and shields makes the direction of these jets difficult to be predicted, but the directionality of these jets should be a main design consideration for these covers. They all showed an intense backward jet for heavy breathing and coughing conditions. It is important to be aware of this jet, to avoid a false sense of security that may arise when standing to the side of, or behind, a person wearing a surgical, or handmade mask, or shield</a></p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762694">Face masks should not be worn by healthy individuals to protect themselves from acquiring respiratory infection because there is no evidence to suggest that face masks worn by healthy individuals are effective in preventing people from becoming ill.</a></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>And these:</p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>

<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not. </li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and “did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.”</li>

        <p>The first half of those links are either done with very limited participants or they talk about the inhalation of particles which isn't the point of masks.</p>
<p>The second half of those links were mainly from over 10 years ago talking about influenza (not that it's much different), recent up to date studies prove the opposite of those </p>
<p>Some of those links don't even do any testing and just say that a particle is smaller than the gap in a mask therefore masks don't work (which is wrong)</p>
<p>This link shows a recent proper study if you care:

<p>I can find more links if you want or I can get you video demonstrations if you want, idm</p>

        <p>Moving the goalposts is an informal fallacy in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. That is, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt. The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the result is changed, too.</p>
<p>OP- "Masks dont protect you"</p>
<p>Idiot- "How about i physically assault you by sneezing in your face. Now you'll see that i'm right."</p>
