    <strong>Young Skeptics and Young Lockdowners: When you look back on your life, how do you think you'll remember all of this?</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone can answer this, but I'm especially trying figure out what is going on in the minds of my peers in particular. We're the main ones getting the shaft on this nonsense, and I just want to rant.</p>
<p>I'm 25 and feel ancient because after multiple breakdowns, I've come to accept the fact that I'm losing a crucial time period of my lifespan development whether I like it or not. Losing a developmental stage to a cause I don't even believe in, mind you. We should be bonding with friends and making  memories that bring us closer together if that's what we want to do. Not avoidance through fear because we see each other as disease-ridden animals. Some of my relationships have changed due to realizing we have different core principles. Yet all of the division is unnecessary, and is clearly by design. </p>
<p>The worst part is, no matter what I do, I can't help but think my life is being squandered away with nothing to look forward to besides work. It's hard to engage in any activity without being reminded "we're in a pandemic". People keep emphasizing "safe" hobbies to me. Well, I lost my video game spirit, mainly because it's one of the few activities that's socially acceptable now. I think I'm rejecting gaming on a psychological level because I don't like being told what I can and can't do. I desperately only want to do "risky" activities now. Are there any other skeptics here having similar feelings?</p>
<p>The breadcrumbing by our government doesn't make me feel any better either. For example, Dewine just lifted the curfews in my state. So what? He shouldn't have had the power to implement curfews in the first place. Why should I celebrate what we always should've had? Same with the mask mandates and lockdowns. The carrot on a stick only pisses me off.  The fact that our basic rights can be taken away on a whim as if our behavior is that of an unruly child is embarrassing. Looking back, I'd be ashamed to say I ever went along with any of this to my future kids and grandkids.</p>
<p>And young pro-new normal supporters, I don't understand what it's like to automatically trust authority or thinking virtue signaling is more important than own my dreams and wanderlust. The pain and anguish I've felt for almost a year has been indescribable. If this drags on as planned, will you look back with fondness because you were "saving lives" and had public opinion on your side? Or will you feel anguish or guilt because you supported losing the best years of your life, as well as supported authoritarian measures that lower the quality of life of others? I guarantee you, supporting the new normal will not be worth it. And it's not too late to see the bigger picture.</p>
<p>The concept of freedom being equated to selfishness makes me feel like we'll be totally boned for a long time. I don't want to keep living like this, with boundaries that aren't even saving lives. But in my opinion, I feel those of us who are skeptical might be feeling really low right now, but I don't think it will compare to the impending despair of those who supported all of this.</p></p>

        <p>I may be a little too hopeful, but I hope that I will look back on all this I will feel sad but grateful that this whole thing has forced me to evaluate what I want in my life, who I want in my life, my values, and how I want to raise children. </p>
<p>Now I mostly feel angry; for myself, my family members who have been brainwashed by the paranoia, the poor kids losing their childhoods, the elderly struggling alone. I am trying to turn the anger into hope for a better future. I know I can't change the world, but I can forge a new path for my family.</p>

        <p>I think Iâ€™ll look back on this as the year when everyone completely threw their brains out of the window and ruined us economically forever. </p>
<p>Shitty economies will lead more people to vote for socialist policies and the downward spiral will continue</p>
