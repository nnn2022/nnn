        <p>Since i speak german i am able to follow him since the start of the launch of his little comittee</p>
<p>i think by now he is one of the most informed individuals on the whole subject of "covid", since he interviewed countless experts</p>
<p>nevertheless i dont recommend seeing someone as "our biggest hope" - in general. you should see him or his work simply as motivation to get active yourself.</p>
<p>that being said</p>
<p>the most interesting thing to me, what he concluded recently, is approximately this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there was a virus leaked in wuhan lab</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is a chance it was actually very dangerous, hence CCP drastically locked people in in wuhan like mad men. once the situation was clear, they reopened it all. ccp was actually scared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is a chance this lab leak is completely unrelated to coronavirus we are facing. corona exists for thousands of years. thats a fact. the chinese lockdowns footage plus lab leak theory were used by "globalists" to push WHO to create global lockdown for pharma profits, also by abusing pcr tests to create charade of pandemic</p>
</li>
</ul>
