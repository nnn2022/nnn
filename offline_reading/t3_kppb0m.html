    <strong>Do you ever wonder what makes you question everything but 95% of the population not?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s just crazy to me that more people don’t question things. I get it that a lot of people scare easily and want to stay comfortably ignorant but I mean the amount of people that do is just shocking to me.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe there’s a psychological explanation- growing up in an environment where you can’t trust people versus one where you can. Valuable lesson being you can’t trust everything you hear.</p>

        <p>That's a solid explanation. I've definitely noticed that people who were treated very well by their parents(and society at large), take authority's word for things that their own senses tell them are false.</p>
<p>I've got a friend who is a great, smart, guy. Like... valedictorian our of highschool, top of his class in college, chemical engineer, eagle scout, the works.</p>
<p>He'd believe sand was a gourmet dish if it was served by someone in a chef's hat. He takes everyone's word upfront and discerns nothing for himself. When presented with information counter to what he has been told, he takes an apathetic attitude. It's baffling to me that someone so smart and well put together cannot fathom that experts can be wrong, bought, or lying. It's not a possibility in his mind.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I'm friends with an NPC and it's a little scary.</p>

        <p>Not super high, but high. The 120-130s who know they're smart, but are far from the creative thinking that is common for 140+ IQ. The ones who are top of their class in school, but still lack the ability to think beyond what they're told. They're the best at operating within the current societal framework, but they are unable to change it.</p>

        <p>This is half true. Even after you're aware of propaganda, you're never immune.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself defending something you have no stake in or getting angry when you read something political that doesn't affect you, sit down and think "why?".</p>
<p>If the answer is "I don't know" or because so-and-so said I should do/think this, you've been propagandized.</p>

        <p>2 days ago I wasn't on this sub and until then, whenever I saw pictures or videos of people without masks (like at events, restaurants, etc) it felt really strange and I was really worried about this feeling. Once I got in here and started reading discussion I stg, i don't have that feeling anymore and for me it's such a liberation.

        <p>Well some days ago I sent a link to a GC of cod friends, just to see their reaction and they labeled me immediately as a conspiracy theorist. But at least one guy was already doing "his research" about this, so it gave me a bit of hope back. And another plus about this is that my dad basically thinks like me about all this fuss.
I'm sorry if some of the sentences are not that clear, unfortunately I'm not a native speaker haha.</p>

        <p>The question wasn't confusing. I'm asking why they feel liberated- do they not believe masks prevent the spread of airborne diseases or do they not believe in covid at all? The alternative is that they do believe in covid, and do believe masks prevent the spread, but they don't care and that seems pretty shitty so I assume it's one of the first two.</p>

        <p>Honestly and personally I think that covid exists. But my "problem" is with how the situation is being handled by governments and authorities. 
About the masks I'm really not sure about their effectiveness, because I really don't know what to believe about them. I heard from people close to me working in the healthcare "sphere" (should I say? Idk feel free to correct me, english is not my first language), that they work and there's nothing that's needed to say about them. But you know, poking around here and there I saw articles saying that by wearing the masks a lot of germs and all of that stuff remains basically stuck in front of our mouth and nose and that could cause problems. In conclusion I have still to form my ideas on this matter.
If you have valuable infos I'll gladly take them into consideration.</p>

        <p>Critical thinking. </p>
<p>Looks easy for us now that we already have our eyes open, but I’m sure we’ve all nurtured this along our lives. </p>
<p>Reading books, studying philosophy, History, etc. This allowed us to at some moment of our lives start questioning authority and the media. Just because they say something is A doesn’t mean it’s actually A. There is always a hidden agenda, which may be either economic or political reasons, but everyone is biased. We realised this and did the click.</p>
<p>Sadly most people are ignorant and comfortable with this matter. Being free and in control of your life is scary for most of the population. It’s easier for the good old government and media to tell us what’s correct and what’s the truth.</p>

        <p>Same here.  I’ve watched over my years, 45 of them, no telling how much of the advance of people and society, through TV, film, and internet.  I have seen how people have shifted to almost entirely “groupthink”.  And we have to be cautious of this, ourselves, even as dissenters of prominent opinion.  Notice I did not say popular opinion, because I think opinion is shifting away from lockdowns and more social constraint.  Slowly...</p>
<p>I digress.  I can point the finger nearly square upon the influence of social media in the past decade, including this website, as the source of so much division between Americans, and the world.  Our so called main stream media never had the strength it does now, until it’s unholy alliance with FB, Twitter, and the like.  Ironically, it has cost their counterparts in print news almost all of their livelihoods.</p>

        <p>We are social creatures. Being ostracized is very powerful. Most people would rather go along to get along. So yes, most people don’t question things or go against the group.</p>

        <p>Typically its more evolutionarily advantageous to follow the herd. People do it because usually it works well with little to no thought or consequences. But when it goes bad, it is an absolute disaster for everyone. </p>
<p>Other people are born as introverts, mavericks, rebels, leaders, or outcasts. These default to anti-establishment/non-conformist wordviews and distrust government and the herd. </p>
<p>When something happens that threaten the herd, the rebels are the only ones to point it out because they are the only ones who form their identity outside the herd. Others who are in-between wake up and start pushing the herd in a different direction until the mindless herd members follow mindlessly like they always do. </p>
<p>I think this is how it works.</p>

        <p>That's why, despite the stereotype of lockdowners as shut-in introverts most lockdowners I've personally encountered are extraverts. Extraverts tend to be more collectivist and more prone to mass hysteria.</p>

        <p>The average person in the first world doesn't live a particularly difficult life.  That's not to say that people don't experience difficulty in their lives, but I've known far more people whose lives were cushy than the ones who experienced real discomfort.  Worse yet, the average person is totally plugged in to MSM and regularly binge watches TV every night, while referring to "binge watching" as a badge of pride.  They have poor foresight because they spend way too much time allowing other people to spoon feed them narratives rather than developing their own narratives.  The whole system is designed to distract the average person and keep them just smart enough to vote but stupid enough to believe what the system tells them(indirectly through their media).  I believe that most people do have the potential to have their IQs raised and to be able to actually think critically, as well as develop morality beyond a 3rd grade level, but such a citizen wouldn't be as easy for the system to extract wealth from.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to know that others here have chosen to stop watching TV.  People believe they will be bored and depressed without it, but most will be happier without it in the long run.  Just pay a little attention to current events, but otherwise go about doing any of the countless better things there are to do than to watch "antiheroes" commit gratuitous violence day in and day out.</p>

        <p>Most conversations nowadays seem to center around whatever Netflix show or movie someone has just watched. “Oh you haven’t seen X show? OMG, you have to watch it! It’s sooooo good.”</p>
<p>Then a week later they’re binging something else and now you also have to watch it! It’s honestly frightening. People get their MSM news on their phones when they wake up, get steady doses throughout the day, then come home and consume even more media. And that’s their entire lives.</p>

        <p>Yeah this is something I’ve always noticed and it’s been alarming even before all this. Growing up I didn’t watch tv so I never cared for it but the amount of people who waste so much of their lives drooling in front the tv is depressing. And when they ask me if I’ve seen something and I tell them I don’t watch tv they react like I’m crazy</p>

        <p>That may be a differential- how much trauma someone has experienced.  Trauma forces you to go inward and you learn so much about yourself and the world.  You start to see through the illusions of childhood and society, including that the people in power/ "the government " are altruistic and care about humanity.  There literally were zero WMD in Iraqi , yet the Military Industrial complex got away with it.</p>

        <p>There are millions like us out there. Fact is just those people aren't hanging out on social media and forums. They are actually outside living their lives. It's the ones that are for lockdowns, masks and so on that are so active on social media. After all, it's all they got. Hence they seem like a far larger portion of the community.

        <p>I think a lot of it is television/propaganda.  I never watched much television and haven't watched cable "news" for many years except when I'm at someone's house who has it.  Nearly all but a handful of my family/acquaintances have cable and <em>all</em> of the ones who do definitely have mainstream thought. The few who don't have cable or watch/read MSM seem to have more independent thought.</p>
<p>There's probably more to it than that, but it seems to be a huge factor.</p>

        <p>To me it’s that most people don’t have the nature to question things. People with STEM backgrounds are taught to question and investigate everything but these people are the minority in society. </p>

        <p>Being in STEM does not mean their opinions are truth. I’m only referring to the fact that they’re more trained to be skeptical when the majority of population are not. They are just as easy to be corrupted by bias as the next person however.</p>

        <p>I think the percent of people questioning is much much higher. Probably around 80%. But the most vocal are the doomers. Not to mention the silent majority doesn’t want to lose their jobs and I’m sure most of the think that everyone else is a doomer even though that’s not true.</p>
<p>The doomers are just the loudest so it SEEMS like everyone is a doomer. If we could go out and socialize you’d see most people aren’t that afraid.</p>

        <p>It’s so many things. The “educational system in this country is purposely setup to shut down critical/independent thinking. Education consists  entirely of I tell you a fact, you repeat it back to me. It’s regurgitation. Anything that encourages individualism is discouraged and or removed from the curriculum. Art, music, debate club all gone. Things I hated to do when I was in school don’t exist anymore. Thesis papers are relics of the past. Why? They encourage research and critical thinking. Books that were mainstays like 1984 and Brave New World are gone. Why? Why would you give the peasants the playbook? That wouldn’t suit your purposes at all. Then you have the empty headed soul less teleprompter reading muppets who tell you the news so you don’t have to burden yourself with thinking. Social media breaks down everything for you into sound bites and 256 characters so you can easily digest and regurgitate the party line. This didn’t just happen in the last year, this has been going on forever.</p>

        <p>The NPC meme is literally a perfect representation of what they are. But they are humans and have souls. That’s why it’s so sad. I’m a Christian so I pray for these people. My view is that I can still be free, though, even if others are deceived. Don’t lose hope!</p>

        <p>I feel like I just kind of lucked out. When I was growing up, my family moved to a house that was oddly placed and couldn't get cable TV because of it. We got a handful of fuzzy channels with rabbit ear antennas, but it was mostly just things like PBS cartoons and reruns of very old shows (still loves me some Three Stooges to this day), but no news or current shows. We had a desktop computer, but we were a large family and everyone wanted their own turn, so internet time was limited unless you wanted to walk a few miles into town to use the library computers. Add homeschooling during high school on to that, and I accidentally avoided the usual brainwashing centers until I was old enough to have formed my own skeptical identity. Younger siblings of mine who lived there a shorter time before moving to a new place with a million channels, smartphones, and a preppy private school turned out to be obedient little serfs.</p>

        <p>This doesn't make sense to me as I am similar in to most here in the sense that I don't watch TV, or go on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat etc</p>
<p>I don't trust the government or people with Authority.</p>
<p>I don't agree with the BLM movement.</p>
<p>I also grew up in a household with a parent that would attempt to manipulate etc therefore I have learnt to question things and be a critical thinker.</p>
<p>Yet I still trust in the science and studies of covid. The ones that explain that despite it being a 95+% survival rate, the long term issues (clots, heart problems, lung problems) are enough to convince me to wear a mask when I go to the shops (I mean, it really isn't that hard) or to not have parties at my place.</p>

        <p>I've thought about this quite a lot. I think part of the reason may be personality type.</p>
<p>Writer Gretchen Rubin has developed a personality framework based on how people respond to an expectation. Questioners will do something if it makes sense to them. Rebels resist all expectations. Obligers and Upholders try to meet all outer expectations. </p>
<p>I am willing to bet that this subreddit has a higher-than-average number of Questioners and Rebels. </p>
<p>Personally, I am a Questioner. </p>
<p>Quiz for those interested: https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/</p>
<p>Anyway, all this to say that I think that a lot of people follow rules no matter what they're told. I NEVER realized this was the case until I came across Gretchen Rubin's work. I thought that everyone thought like me! I question EVERYTHING. Other people do not.</p>

        <p>I think it’s a generation thing. Boomers grew up thinking the government and authority can be trusted. And young people have nothing going on with their lives besides social media and video games are excited to be living through a “pandemic”. If the pandemic ends their lives become boring again.</p>

        <p>I think it's lower than 95%, especially in the US, it's just that the media(s) don't portray it as such and with censorship and social distancing the thoughts are less visible. It makes it hard to assemble, too. It's supposed to be crazy, and crazy-making, when you look into the psychology of everything.</p>

        <p>This question has been on my mind a lot lately. I come from a family of doomers that take Fauci's word for as gospel and refuse to think critically about any of this. It's maddening because they're all educated people - two of them even have Ivy league degrees. But its insane - absolutely no questioning the lockdown / mitigation efforts and the politicians who implement them. Phil Murphy has them convinced that if they eat some spaghetti inside a restaurant then airborne ebola covid is going to strike. </p>
<p>But what's got me really annoyed this past week is the whole "Oh - 2020 - what a bad year! Now that Biden is taking office and we have a vaccine we can all go back to normal soon and pretend this didn't happen.."  - It's hard to articulate how infuriating that way of thinking. 2020 wasn't a "bad year" - it wasn't a fluke. The unfolding of events wasn't predetermined and the all the suffering and carnage wasn't inevitable. The hysteria and scapegoating and media fear mongering and bootlicking has carried right on over to the new year. 2021 is going to somehow be magically better? So much damage has been done and continues to be done yet those responsible are just carrying on.</p>
<p>Up until this past year I was a pretty laid back guy. Pretty easy going. Now I'm angry. I wake up angry. I go to sleep angry. I'm living in a clown world where questioning unchecked Governors drunk on power makes me a bad person.</p>

        <p>Most people are NPCs or automatons. Not even joking. There are people that absolutely have no sort of inner monologue. The NPCs are easily misled because they have no true thoughts. They're like water which can change shapes based on the container it's in. The NPCs change their opinions based on the perceived majority opinion, which is why the media is an EXTRAORDINARILY powerful tool for the elite. The NPCs don't take much to sway. Just have all of the media fear monger for a whole fuck load of time and you've got your hysterical NPCs. </p>
<p>If you saw through the bullshit, it's because you actually questioned the narrative and don't base your own opinions off of the majority.</p>

        <p>I'd say it has something to do with the bullying/abuse I experienced throughout childhood and adolescence. At a very young age, I learned that police officers, military personnel, healthcare workers, school administrators, parents, and other assorted authority figures are far too often undeserving of that authority. No, I don't think they're all inherently malicious or even stupid, but they are all human. And humans are just animals, animals who will almost always put themselves and their loved ones over strangers and aquaintances. And they often can't even do that right because the wants and needs of any two people are rarely ever aligned.</p>
<p>That said, my husband is equally skeptical of authority. Very little experience with bullying/abuse unless you count bearing the brunt of his loved ones' occasional breakdowns. Compared to me, he grew up very happy and comfortable with little reason not to trust authority figures. Yet he always has, ever since early childhood, just like me. It seems that many genetic and environmental factors could play a role, but I highly doubt we'll ever have a real answer to this milliom-dollar question. All I know is that those oh-so-trusting "greater good" collectivists are no less crazy or stupid than we are.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's that many that don't question. I think social media skews the numbers quite a bit. Most, like me, just go along with the little stuff because it's just not worth the fuss or the fight, and conserve our energy for the big stuff. I know tons of people who are fed up with the BS, but just don't want to fight every damn place they go. Out of my family and circle of friends, I only knew a couple that are unquestioning of all the restrictions, mask mandates and absurdity. Everyone else just goes along because we still need to go to the store, drop our kids at school, and try to continue some modicum of life. I'm just a bit apprehensive as I'm starting up college again for the first time in well over a decade 8 days from now.</p>

        <p>The main reason, in my opinion, is public schools. From ages 5 to 22, students are systematically trained to perform for a grade by doing what their superior tells them to. It’s not an accident. I mean what possible reason do we have children learn in this way? There is so much pressure out on children and their creativity and independence is often crushed at an early age. You can look into the history of the Prussian model of schooling that America’s schools were based off of. The funny thing is that conservative parents hand their kids off to the enemy and then wonder why they turn out so bad.  I’m definitely not an expert, but Tom Woods has good resources on this. </p>
<p>Also, some people just have a personality that likes to question things more. Personally, I told my dad at five years old that it doesn’t make sense for Santa to be real and then he told me the truth. I feel like since then I’ve always desired to know the truth and find my blind spots. People just don’t. They need Jesus:)</p>

        <p>A lot of people are mainstream and the media and cooperations cater to them, things such as the x factor, really TV such as Gogglebox and real housewives interests them, a lot of people haven't read a book out of choice in years in some cases decades, and a lot of these people enjoy cheap fast entertainment such as shopping in stores such as Primark in order to buy novelty items cheaply. </p>
<p>I'm generalising here so please don't get offended if you like these things, I just estimate that about 40% of the people in the UK are like this and those are a lot of the people that are buying into this pandemic narrative.</p>

        <p>I don't know, but I've always been that way. I have always been wary of authority figures - they are not all knowing, all loving gods, they are humans and are vulnerable to the effects of power and greed just like anybody. It makes them act like they're not human.</p>
<p>I also love asking questions. I need answers, explainations. I would like to have a discussion to try to understand someone's point of view, I would like to listen to why they think the way they do and see if it educates me, and see if what I say to them can educate them or even shift their perspective. I do not like shouting matches and I do not like it when someone insults me for having a different opinion without trying to discuss or understand or even bothering giving me a rational explanation for why their opinion is what it is.</p>
<p>I can never understand why people just accept systems that are wrong rather than trying to change them. As I grow older, it does start to become clearer to me, but I still hate the feeling of helplessness. I still wonder why people don't even try.</p>
<p>Fear is not something that drives my actions as strongly. My sister died when I was five years old so I was quickly accepting of death. You could say it makes me a little insensitive sometimes, but I do not fear it as much as others. I like to take risks, for the experience. So this whole thing gets me because it just seems like a whole lot of people aren't willing to take the smallest risks because they're scared, and at this point we seem to be outright trying to eradicate death. It's silly.</p>
<p>And really, I have always loved to go against the herd. I love to know that I formed my opinion not on what someone told me to think but what I think, that I have thought about it and am free to feel that way. I don't mind standing out if I know I'm standing on my own two feet. I rather enjoy it, but I know I must be wary of going against the herd for the sake of it, because they are sometimes right too.</p>
<p>Honestly, thanks to all of this I now understand why I feel out of place. I love the joy of being awake and thinking for myself, but not always. The only reason I can see that most people are like this is because ignorance can be bliss. I find myself sometimes wishing I could also feel like this is right, like it's all for the best and agreeing with all of the popular fallacies just so it hurts less to keep going. That pressure, that pain and the feeling of not fitting in, that is the only reason I can see as to why people are going along with this. But I do wonder, are they the only reasons or will these people always be like this?</p>

        <p>Great write up. I’m with you man, you’re not alone in any of this. Don’t think for a second that believing in all of this would make you feel better- honestly, would still probably feel shit with all the restrictions but would feel guilty for wanting to do more than the minimum grocery shopping. That guilt would probably make you feel worse. Be proud of who you are and where you’ve reached so far. You’re doing great, keep it going man and all the best to you.</p>
