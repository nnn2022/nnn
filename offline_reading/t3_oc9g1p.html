        <p>At  NBA playoff games, basically anybody who’s even loosely affiliated with the game (assistant coaches, players on the sidelines, ball boys, people at the scorer’s table, even the camerman) has to wear a mask except for the referees, head coaches (assistant coaches still have to wear masks though) and players in the game. (Who have to put on a mask when they go on the bench.) </p>
<p>The difference between this and the NBA is that the fans in the first few rows of NBA games are required to wear masks, too. But no fans behind the first few rows ever seem to be wearing masks. </p>
<p>It’s pretty bizarre how the fans who get the most expensive seats at NBA games are the only fans who have to wear a mask. Obviously it’s because the NBA wants to show a whole bunch of masked people on camera, but still.</p>
