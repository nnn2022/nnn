    <strong>My 76 year old father has survived double heart bypass, cancer and Covid-19 - and now they’ve convinced him to take the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I am all for bodily autonomy but I’ve discovered my father’s doctor has outright lied to him about what the “vaccine” does, telling him he can “go back to normal” after having it, and that he won’t be able to spread the virus to others.</p>
<p>This is a man that has already had severe Covid, and dealt with symptoms for 3 weeks, including vertigo, nausea, loss of taste, smell and appetite, and who had high fevers, chills, aches, the whole enchilada.  </p>
<p>He is now mourning the loss of a brother and BIL this past month, and having heart problems of his own.</p>
<p>Amidst all this stress and anxiety, they lie to convince him to take this experimental poison.  </p>
<p>I am at my wit’s end.  I won’t stop him if he insist he wants to do this, even after I warned him, and told him to look into the Moderna jab before he gets it.... but he says he’s already made up his mind.</p>
<p>Told him he can’t sue anyone if it goes wrong, and cost of after care is on him, and funeral expenses on us, if worse comes to worst.  Pharmaceuticals are exempt from damages I told him.</p>
<p>Also gave examples of the vaccines killing people his age, and of the severity of the side effects in many people. </p>
<p>It feels like watching a loved one walk straight into a slaughterhouse. </p>

        <p>I dunno. Kind of heartbreaking when I show him point blank that his primary doctor and cardiologist are both lying, misinformed scumbags, and he still believes them over me.  I seriously showed him Moderna’s own info which states it doesn’t prevent infection or transmission, and asked him why he’s doing it then. </p>
<p>“So I don’t get it as bad.”</p>
<p>And there’s no proof it does even that.  </p>
<p>Fucking pharma assholes. My dad is going to die at the hands of these vultures and there’s nothing I can do about it.</p>

        <p>Right.  And survived with no lasting effects. I wonder if the adverse reaction to the untested genetic therapy will be what finishes him off.</p>

        <p>We had a similar problem with elderly parents. Father in law has severe dimentia and mother in law can barely walk from knee surgery. We ended up having to say that they were grown adults and had the right to choose. We tried to get them to not vax. They did it anyway. Stubborn old people.</p>
