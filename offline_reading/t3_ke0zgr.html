    <strong>Pretty much all of you and anti-vaxers, have had multiple vaccinations</strong>
    <p><p>I'm feeling similarly to you all and am not rushing to get the vaccine. But I was reading about the MMR vaccine and got me thinking. When that thing came out it was probably pretty new and untested for long term side effects (I know it's not mRNA).</p>
<p>Are we being guilty of time bias? The vaccines that we received did not have life altering side effects (that I noticed). There may be many new vaccines in the future. Why is this the one that we should be concerned about? </p>
<p>Is it about the profit motive being worse this time?  Government being corrupt? If it were a conspiracy to make us all infertile, why now, why not any of the previous vaccines?</p>
<p>Why are anti vaxers whose kids got measles idiots but anti vaxers now make sense?</p>
<p>Hope you understand my question are in good faith. I'm thinking now in advanced for when people start asking me questions. Many people I know were ready to take the vaccine before it even existed.</p></p>

<p>It is untested technology.</p>

        <p>My main thing is covid isn’t fatal for healthy people under 70.  I am not risking any chance of getting injured from the shot even if it’s low.  Chances of my dying from covid is almost 0.   Plus they say the vaccine may or may not prevent your from getting and spreading covid so why take the risk?  If healthy people were actually dropping like flies it would be a different story for me.</p>

        <p>You could use any of these responses;</p>
<p>If you take the vaccine, I shouldn’t have to. </p>
<p>I have the right to make my own decisions. </p>
<p>I’ve taken vaccines, but I’m not taking one for a virus with a 99.98% survival rate, and has symptoms identical to a common cold.</p>
<p>I don’t have to explain my personal decisions to a random on the internet.</p>
<p>Why does it affect you if I take the vaccine or not? If I thought the virus was deadly, I would take it. But I don’t, and my life isn’t in your control.</p>
<p>If you’re so scared of the virus, why not just take <em>your</em> vaccine and leave the rest of us alone? I thought you wanted all of the anti-maskers to die anyways? </p>
<p>On another note: These paranoid freaks have been begging for Darwinism to kill us off for the past 10 months to no avail but now they’re begging for us to get their vaccine. If the general human population thought this virus was so deadly, they wouldn’t need to ask anyone to get the vaccine. Self-preservation.</p>
<p>I swear to god if they somehow get us to continue lockdowns and mask mandates after the vaccine, I’m going to scream at my TV screen.</p>

<p>the doomers have wished death on me multiple times. </p>
<p>wouldnt this play into their desires? </p>
<p>the vaccine doesnt prevent spread. it just prevents severity of symptoms. they want me to die so bad wouldnt me not taking it just make them happy?</p>

        <p>Reason #1 for me: this unnecessary vaccine was paid for with blood money. </p>
<p>Billions of dollars of our money was poured into these things as a 'solution' for one to one of the most mild pandemics in the last 100 years. And this was done full-well knowing that there was a very high chance that it would not be ready in time to make any difference. Now even though that it is ready, guess what? By the time it's ready on a large enough scale this virus will be completely done. Burnt out on our own immune systems. Further to this, it is very clear that there is an attempt being made to turn this into an easily repeatable business model by eroding our rights in order to make the vaccine mandatory. Maybe that attempt isn't going to work everywhere but it's obvious that this is what they want. It is also obvious that some of the people pushing these vaccines went out of their way to drive up fear and promote this absolutely medieval and self-destructive medical intervention that we call lockdowns. Literally ruining people's lives because they wanted to make a buck.</p>
<p>Now yes I have my concerns about the potential side-effects of the vaccine and its lack of testing. No I don't think that it makes sense to risk these side-effects for a virus which has a statistically zero chance to kill me (and which I've probably already had). But I admit that you could convince me that they are safe with enough quality data. I don't care still would never take it.</p>

        <p>yes when I was a child and had no choice. </p>
<p>we have a few vaccines which offer great immunity and have pretty much eliminated a disease. </p>
<p>we also have low efficiency pretty much useless vaccines</p>
<p>flu, whooping cough, rotovirus</p>
<p>now a new mrna vaccine previously untested on humans until this year, with no fda approval (only emergency approval)?  for a very undeadly disease? </p>

        <p>A lot of the loudest voices against the Covid vaccines are, coming from the pro vaxers!!! They understand that a vaccine takes decades to develop, animal testing must be done before it’s even trialed on humans. The early human studies must be done  in conjunction with a 10 year placebo study.</p>

        <p>I have had all of the vaccines which were vaccines.  MMR, small pox blah blah blah.  But flu and Covid I will not get as they aren't vaccines.  They are just immunity boosters.  They are designed to give you the thing you don't want but doesn't prevent you from getting it or spreading it to others.  It doesn't eliminate anything,  If we don't know the long term effects of what Covid does to the body, how do we know what the long term effects of the covid vaccine will do the the body?  Plus new technology.  </p>
<p>If I have to take a vaccine and still wear a mask and can't travel even after the 2nd dose what is the purpose of the vaccine?  And now they are claiming there is a new variation of Covid in the UK, so will this vaccine work against that one?  Viruses mutate, the flu does every year.  The vaccine isn't going to eliminate covid, like the small pox vaccine.  It's here to stay.</p>
<p>You ask, "Is it about the profit motive being worse this time? Government being corrupt? If it were a conspiracy to make us all infertile, why now, why not any of the previous vaccines?"  why now?  Agenda 2030.  This is to be the decade of the vaccine and control.  Do some research, please</p>

        <p>The vaccines we received did have the potential of harmful side effects... This isn't new.   </p>
<p>Moreover, genuine studies of the efficacy of vaccines versus unvaccinated children all seem to agree that vaccination is harmful. The info is out there for those willing to look.   </p>
<p>This is why you hear Bill Gates saying things like "well if we do really well with vaccinations we can bring that number (The number of human beings living on earth) down by a few billion." Or something to that effect, too lazy to find the actual quote. But wait Bill, if vaccines are helping people how is increasing vaccination going to reduce the population?</p>
