        <p>I’ve said this countless times. </p>
<p>The responses usually are </p>
<p>“ TB has treatments “ well that doesn’t stop the deaths does it </p>
<p>“There isn’t high tuberculosis deaths in America “</p>
<p>“COVID is more deadly”</p>

        <p>They also forget that TB is caused by a bacteria, and not a virus... a lot of comparisons people make are to bacterial infections... which I find odd... but if you compare it with another corona virus (flu, cold) you are called stupid...I wonder how many people will get bacterial infections of the lungs in the next year from face covering.</p>

        <p>Honestly - the number of people that don't know the difference between a virus and bacteria is still startling to me.  But I constantly hear people bitching that their doctors wouldn't prescribe an antibiotic for their cold.  </p>
<p>When I try to explain the cold is caused by a virus and that antibiotics work on bacterial infections only, they look at me like I'm a moron or something.</p>
<p>I swear to god it's exactly like portrayed in the movie Idiocracy.  <br>

        <p>Words like Idiot, Moron, Fool, Fag, Queer, Nigger, etc., etc. do nothing good for a person who uses them in the eyes of another. All are used to dismiss a person’s opinion and demean that person’s perspective. Those are words of subordination and should only be used to destroy character and there is never a good time to do that.</p>

        <p>And then they preach to use anti bacterial soap for covid. No... Wash your hands with HOT water for a long time. They also don't realize that viruses was A LOT smaller, which is why surgical masks warn that they are ineffective for viruses because they aren't stopping something .1 microns in size.</p>

        <p>Yep exactly.</p>
<p>Months ago I did the math on the virus vs cloth mask.  I had a link to a scanning electron microscope pic of cotton weave fibers that also had a scale ruler or something.</p>
<p>When I blew the virus up to the size of a man, then used that same multiple to blow up the cotton fiber, it was amazing.  At that scale with the virus being the size of a 6' tall man, the closest cotton fibers would be over 1 mile apart from each other.</p>
<p>But then people would respond with "Well it's better than nothing".  ugh</p>

        <p>The virus travels through the air on little ponies called water droplets. Water droplets are quite significant in size and when used, surgical masks can help in preventing the spread if all parties are wearing a mask. No, cloth coverings you make at home are not very effective at all and that's widely known. The idea of all people wearing the masks when in close quarters is to protect each other, the surgical masks do a fair job of trapping exhaled water vapor, sneezes, coughs and phlegm. When they talk about using soap to wash your hands for a minimum of 20seconds it's because soaps are known to strip the surface of your skin of natural oils and foreign oils, dirt and debris. The lather created when using soap helps in this cleansing of the skin. </p>
<p>Pre covid the efficacy of washing hands and mask use inside of hospitals to protect patients and staff were never put into question, why? Because the medical community knows it works or at the least has a significant enough positive impact to become a recommended practice for all during a pandemic. </p>
<p>For sure you can find articles and supporting "evidence" to say that the protections in place or the recommendations are BS. Just remember though that you can also find sporting articles and "evidence" that the holocaust never happened and the earth is flat. Getting the scientific community to overwhelmingly agree on something is not easy but when they do, we should really put our opinions aside and have a really good listen.</p>

<p>FTA:<br>
&rt; It would appear that minimum contamination can best be achieved by not wearing a mask at all but operating in silence. </p>

        <p>I mean as a human experience with being sick, I don’t think people care what caused it... but bacteria are huge compared to viruses. Face masks were thought to reduce bacterial infections in surgery... no so much viruses. But this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/">study</a> from 2015, basically said there is no evidence either way. There are other studies (you have to look before 2019 obviously) that discuss the effectiveness of masks. Also you can treat a bacterial infection with antibiotics, where a virus has to run it’s course. It’s just people screaming about science who don’t know the difference between the two that get to me.</p>

        <p>An excerpt from that study: </p>
<p>"...the Webster study, arguably the most rigorous of the three, only investigated the impact of mask on <em>non-scrubbed members of the surgical team</em>. There is uncertainty over whether the findings of some of these studies are applicable to contemporary surgical practice."</p>

        <p>OK so the Reddit Administrators are automatically censoring BitChute video links!!  I can't believe this.  BITCHUTE is an alternative to YouTube!!</p>
<p>So they just advised me that my last reply was removed.</p>
<p>Here's the reply with the Bitchute link removed:</p>
<p>&rt; Yes we do and these doctors are reporting success with treating hundreds of Covid19 patients.  One doctor went so far as to call it (HCQ+Zinc) a cure.  However the first doctor speaking in [the vid described below]  Dr. Simone Gold was fired, after this vid surfaced, and she was recently told that <a href="https://twitter.com/drsimonegold/status/1321390113390092288?s=20">she could face consequences</a> for prescribing HCQ to her covid patients.  </p>
<p>Go to BITCHUTE search for:<br>

        <p>Yeah and HCQ has been around for 70 years or so and prior to Covid, it was considered as one of, if not THE safest drug on the market.  But suddenly with Covid there came this "uh oh, it might be bad for your heart" narrative.  Meanwhile it's no more difficult to get than aspirin in many parts of the world - it's an over the counter med that doesn't require a script.</p>

        <p>Although you're partially right, lock downs are engineered as a psychological war on people to subjugate them, to divide them and to create conflict. The economy is only one aspect of it, and as side benefit they also know the lock downs will kill people resulting from mental illness, both pre existing and newly developed, economic strain and the fear of seeking medical attention for conditions that will escalate without.</p>

        <p>This argument doesn't make any sense. South Korea and New Zealand had lockdowns, although short lockdowns, because they were prepared to handle the pandemic - and they did it with few deaths.</p>
<p>The US on the other hand continues to reopen and infections/deaths continue to increase. All because of uneducated people like you.</p>

        <p>Are you a troll? i'm curious. What level of education does it take to see how they needed to fabricate the pandemic by killing thousands of old and sick people through deliberate infection compounded by the mandate to count deaths as COVID even if only based on supposition compounded again by the financial incentives given to hospitals for COVID ruled deaths. </p>
<p>Then of course you're exceptional education would have also opened your eyes to the fact that the entire pandemic's propagation from day 1 is mathematically impossible and based on their claims virtually every human would have already been exposed. I would elaborate, but you're academic superiority would already have made you well aware of this, therefore I do not want to insult such intelligence.</p>

        <p>That's cool, but probability statistics is math just for the record and that math clearly reveals that the pandemic from day 1 was unnatural in it's propagation patterns and trends. However, I'm glad we clarified the misunderstanding in context.</p>

        <p>Please, you are the one claiming the problem stems from undereducated people. If you need to ask that question and you are educated then perhaps that is the real problem where no longer are these educated people capable of thinking for themselves and applying reason and logic.</p>
<p>Chart the data. From Dec 1 (estimated date of origin), follow the timelines of infection spread, border closings and internal lock downs. Then factor in the flight and travel patterns from Wuhan and throughout Asia and the alleged infectiousness and virulence of COVID. </p>
<p>You also have to have an understanding of how virus's spread to understand the corresponding patterns that will ensue.. Virus's follow two distinct rules, high infectiousness low virulence or low infectiousness, high virulence. And if you try and use the Spanish Flu as an example to the contrary, it won't fly. All information surrounding the Spanish flu is speculative, inclusive of that it is also suspected that many of the deaths were caused by a bacterial pneumonia NOT a flu. However, even in the event of an anomaly whereby you have a virus that possesses both a high infectiousness and virulence, well in this case, bend over and kiss your ass goodbye.</p>
<p>So understanding the basic principle's viral attributes, we can examine the propagation trends in conjunction with the timelines.</p>
<p>First, apply some basic reasoning, that the virus had managed to propagate throughout the world within 2 months. These were the identified cases. Based on symptoms and incubation periods the number of people who would have been exposed and contracted the virus to achieve identification in all these countries would already be astronomical. Then factor in the border closings and lockdowns, which the earliest border closing was end of January, and lockdowns didn't take place until late February and most not until the end of March. </p>
<p>At the demonstrated rate that this virus had propagated by the end of January, whereby Patient 0 managed to infect enough people to spread this virus around the world would also mean that based on the travel and flight patterns that Eastern Asia would have been a literal graveyard long before any measures were taken. And this is how the Pandemic would have spread, the epicenters emerging and progressing in a clear geographic pattern outwards from the source. Please note, this isn't a movie, this is reality. Furthermore, long before places like Italy and NYC would have experienced these outbreaks, many other places like London, Hawaii the Entire west coast of the US would have been crushed. You also don't have these randomized outbreaks in countries whereby the virus was identified in early spring, then spontaneously cropping up 6 months later at the rate of infectiousness that they have claimed, these countries would have already been inundated and fully exposed. If patient 0 spread the virus across the globe in 2 months, then the thousands upon thousands of infected people needed to accomplish this would have infected the remaining billions in the next few months.</p>
<p>The list of contradictions is endless and this doesn't even factor in the nonsense of the COVID mandates to declare deaths as COVID under pure supposition, the COVID payments being made for these declarations and placing known infected in with a high risk population..</p>
<p>If you can't see how this is mathematically impossible then you need to rethink your definition of the value of education.</p>
<p>I did the research and mapped it out...If you really want to see the facts do the same.</p>

        <p>Something like 2 billion (yes billion, with a 'B') are infected with TB, and it can linger for decades. Lockdowns or masks aren't going to do shit to solve that problem.  </p>
<p>Also, I'm just going to point out that before there were decent treatments for TB there used to be these places called "sanatoriums" which served as a mechanism to physically isolate patients with active TB cases from the rest of the population. This is a few steps up from the current "please don't talk to anyone for 2 weeks" COVID standard.</p>

        <p>Have you heard of a covid ward in the hospital? Same exact concept as a sanatorium. You want to separate sick people from the healthy as much as possible. We’ve been doing this since the Black Plague. </p>
<p>It’s the separating of healthy people from other healthy people that has never been tried before. </p>
<p>Also active TB patients need to be in airborne isolation.  It’s an airborne disease (unlike covid), so routine hand hygiene, mask and gown isn’t enough. Hence why they had separate buildings for TB patients back in the day.</p>

        <p>Hospitals are filled with "At risk" and simply plain sick people, therefore separating people is common place. BTW they also have cancer wards, but cancer isn't contagious is it?..Separating people into specific wards is been around for ever, it's primary purpose is efficiency and secondary is the health risks that one type of condition could place on another. You would never have put pneumonia patients in with respiratory illnesses or heart conditions. So although they may say that COVID is novel, these procedures are not. </p>
<p>Isolating the TB patients was primarily for the TB patients themselves becasue the conventional treatment was fresh clean air and plenty of rest, which a typical ward would not provide the " peace and quiet" required. This is why they had expensive sanitoriums whereby those who could afford them could seek these environments. eventually they made these places available to those who could not afford them.</p>
<p>The black plague in itself is a bad example becasue this was a disease that was transmitted almost completely by infected fleas, rats being the primary host. Although people of higher economic stature did succumb to the plague, it was primarily a  poor man's disease for the most because they simply lived in rat infested environments. No rats no plague. Isolating the sick in this case really only served as a psychological reliever.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html</a></p>
<p>In the case of human to human transmitted virus's and bacteria's, there is no evidence that any form of isolation will prevent the spread, it may prolong it but there will always be carriers, or just the simple logic that the virus was born, therefore it will return until we have developed a tolerance or immunity or method to treat it, however treatment is limited as these organisms have a uncanny ability to evolve into new strains or become treatment resistant. The most logical approach is to isolate the at risk until an effective treatment can be found, and those who are healthy should allow their immune systems to evolve with the disease or our immune systems are at risk of becoming completely useless. </p>
<p>Anyway there is  a lot more i could add but I' m tired so I'll leave it at this for now.</p>

<p>TB has an incubation period of about 12 weeks. Only those with active TB in their lungs can transmit and TB is curable in most cases, so why aren't these people being treated considering that TB is considered the most lethal infectious disease we currently have claiming 1.5 million lives a year. Also as opposed to COVID TB has a far less disparity in age and comorbidities (other than AIDS, which is also very treatable now), as an underlying contributor.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how you can state that lock downs and masks would "not do shit", when in fact if people were isolated and treated the spread would rapidly diminish. Additionally, masks would be far more effective for TB considering it is only transmittable through direct inhalation and cannot be contracted through surface contact. </p>
<p>The only reason they are not addressing TB is becasue of the geographic, demographic and socioeconomic factors of where TB is prevalent. If you are diagnosed with TB in developed countries you are given a drug regiment and when it's done, you're cured. </p>
<p>Also, people weren't forced into sanitoriums, in fact when they were originally implemented they catered to the wealthy becasue they were very costly treatment centers. Eventually they extended access to those who could not afford to attend one. Recommended and prescribed, not forcible quarantine.</p>

        <p>Yep, I've tried to point this out many times but just like starvation, it's primarily isolated to a select number of third world countries, nobody seems to care and presumably these people are expendable in the eyes of the sheep. This is how self absorbed the world has become, they pretend to care about Grandma as an excuse or alibi, but really they only care about themselves. </p>

        <p>Now here me out here:</p>
<p>TB has been killing 1.5 million</p>
<p>Coronavirus: 1.7 million deaths </p>
<p>Now let's consider something if the government wanted to use a virus to control the masses why wait till 2020. Hell if this is some liberal grab for power or some mind control bs as people have been spouting, then why not have just used TB in the first place and done this litteraly decades ago. </p>
<p>Logically your argument here makes no sense. All you do is provide evidence to the fact that there is legitimate reasoning to the covid lock downs. </p>
<p>The simple fact is covid is spreading a hell of a lot faster. This disease is killing 1.7 million people in its first year. ITS FIRST YEAR and we still have not platued yet.</p>
<p>Something you have to consider when looking at the spread of diseases from one year to the next there is no blank slate. Like the people who have covid or tb don't just lose their disease on January 1st. They are still able to spread it so the new cases are a direct product of the previous cases. So let's say 1 million people catch still have the disease on December 31st. The following year sees 32 million new cases. Those 32 million spawned from that 1 million. </p>
<p>In covid-19's case 44 million cases stemed from one in about 10 months. </p>
<p>That's the problem. Especially when only 29.9 million of those have recovered so far. </p>
<p>If this is what covid can do in 1 year. Then what it could do in 2 or even 3 years is not something anyone wants to see.</p>

<p>"Recovered" is just a matter of bureaucracy. Some countries don't track those or they are reported late. </p>
<p>"If this is what covid can do in 1 year. Then what it could do in 2 or even 3 years is not something anyone wants to see. "</p>
<p>But we will have to, a pandemic ultimately will run its course. In most of the world, nothing much can be done now, it's already in the population and it'll remain there (Frankly, it was probably too late the moment it left China) We have already seen that at that point, lockdowns are useless since it just comes back later.</p>

        <p>Okay dismiss my point their whatever. But lockdowns do help stop the spread of diseases it makes each wave less dangerous than it could be. Put it this way if you could get to the point where we have a covid vaccine or preventative treatment with 100 dead people from covid or 1,000 which would you want. Because deaths won't stop untill we have a vaccine but we can control how many die to an extent.</p>

        <p>I think people will be dying anyway. We got flu vaccines and people still die of the flu every year by the thousands ( Granted, not everyone takes the flu vaccine ) because the vaccines are not very effective. I think we'll see something like that Covid as well.  It'll just become another respiratory illness after a while</p>

        <p>I've addressed the skewed death numbers NUMEROUS times but <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jjvdhe/in_2018_the_who_reported_that_15_million_people/gahtfrd/">here's my latest post about it</a>.  There's more if you dig but you seem like you would rather quote official numbers than learn actual truth.</p>
<p>Well your question about why not use TB instead of Covid doesn't actually have to be answered.  Just because you can't think of a reason doesn't mean there's no agenda.  There are plenty of reasonable reasons including TB is well understood, easily treated with proper antibiotics administered early enough, it doesn't spark the "fear" response like something new and not understood and on and on it goes.  But none of that actually matters because they're already doing what they're doing with Covid.</p>
<p>&rt; Logically your argument here makes no sense. All you do is provide evidence to the fact that there is legitimate reasoning to the covid lock downs.</p>
<p>No you can say that but it doesn't make you correct.</p>
<p>Lockdowns were to flatten the curve so we didn't swamp hospital resources - but people like you got confused and thought it was actually to help fight the virus.  Lockdowns do nothing to stop the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; The simple fact is covid is spreading a hell of a lot faster.</p>
<p>This is patently FALSE.</p>
<p>The numbers have risen faster but there are some very good reasons for this.  Large states like Texas and Arizona simply require a cough to classify someone as Covid Positive A FUCKING COUGH....that's it.</p>
<p>Don't believe me?  Here's proof and notice the similar language.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/1AJWJHe">TX proof</a>  </p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/01GQYGG">AZ proof</a></p>
<p>And those are the only two I looked for - it took awhile to find that info but I found it and due to the similar language it's likely the same in other states.  </p>
<p>Case numbers have been skewed to hell and back and can no longer be relied upon.</p>
<p>&rt; Something you have to consider when looking at the spread of diseases from one year to the next there is no blank slate. Like the people who have covid or tb don't just lose their disease on January 1st. </p>
<p>Never claimed this wasn't an issue.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">You just attacked this straw man</a> but it doesn't refute nor address the original claim. </p>
<p>&rt; They are still able to spread it so the new cases are a direct product of the previous cases. So let's say 1 million people catch still have the disease on December 31st. The following year sees 32 million new cases. Those 32 million spawned from that 1 million.</p>
<p>You're just making up numbers now.  I've addressed the shenanigans with reporting cases one of the first things you realize when data has been skewed is you try to correct it but if you can't, you simply stop relying on it.  There's no way to correct the case data and there are so many flaws with it it's not even funny.</p>
<p>There are so many reports of multiple testings being counted as individual cases.  Like if you get tested 3 times and you test positive 3 times, that's being reported as 3 cases.  Not ONE case like it should be.  </p>
<p>&rt; If this is what covid can do in 1 year. Then what it could do in 2 or even 3 years is not something anyone wants to see.</p>
<p>Well we only have to look to past SARS outbreaks.  We didn't have lock downs, we developed herd immunity and went on living.  Same with Avian Flu, West Nile Virus, H1N1 and every other pandemic in history and we didn't lock down, we didn't mask up, we simply went on with our lives.</p>
<p>Stop believing the bullshit and do your own research.</p>

        <p>See here is the thing I do my own research and in fact nothing about your texas proof or arizona proof is true. Neither say that a cough makes you covid positive it does make you covid probable. Which is smart because it's better to assume someone has the disease and be wrong after you test them than to assume they don't have it and then be wrong. Either way it doesn't count towards totals untill someone pops hot for covid. </p>
<p>The thing is with your skewed numbers point. Let's just say any of it was true. The problem lies in that it's not just america or even first world countries that are going into or had to go into lockdowns. Russia is in lockdown. Cuba is in lock down. South africa is in lockdown. India is in lockdown. This isnt a first world  or even an american issue this is a worldwide issue that the country with the most cases is calling fake. </p>
<p>That's something else you can't answer what motive does the US have. That was really the point I was getting at with the whole tb point. There is no point for the US to fake covid, at least no point that wouldn't have also made sense to do decades ago with tb. </p>
<p>And as for the spreads faster. Yes it does. Tb you have to start showing symptoms to really start spreading it. Covid you can feel fine for two weeks and be spreading it the whole time. Or be asymptomatic and be spreading it for about a month. That's just basic logical reasoning that one is a hell of a lot more easy to spread than the other. </p>
<p>I do also like how you broke up one of my points into two separate points. </p>
<p>&rt;Something you have to consider when looking at the spread of diseases from one year to the next there is no blank slate. Like the people who have covid or tb don't just lose their disease on January 1st. They are still able to spread it so the new cases are a direct product of the previous cases. So let's say 1 million people catch still have the disease on December 31st. The following year sees 32 million new cases. Those 32 million spawned from that 1 million.</p>
<p>Also of course I am making up numbers here it's called a hypothetical. It wasn't used to prove a specific fact more the give an example of the logic used when dealing with coronavirus. Which is also important because you then left out my next point about how 44 million cases stemed from 1. Which was the whole point in that entire paragraph that you just cherry picked to make yourself sounds more smart when in reality you just purposefully ignored what I meant. Your as bad as the media the sub critizes. </p>
<p>Lastly the swine flu pandemic killed 240,000 people (although due to failure to report cases the deaths could be as high as 400,00) </p>
<p>The avian flu simply didn't affect enough humans to provoke a response although it did scare the shit out of us for a while because if it did spread to the humans like it spread in between the chickens then there would have been heavy death toles. </p>
<p>West Nile flu kill less than 200 americans a year. Covid litteraly is 100 times worse. </p>
<p>Finally the  pandemic this one is most closely associated with the 1918 pandemic. Which was partially ended with the discovery a vaccine but partially with those immunities you talk about. But do you know how many lives it cost. 50 million. That's worse than the holocaust, 9/11, and the mongols. Do you really wanna kill 50 million people just so you can go to a restaurant or go into a building without a mask. Also there was mask ordinances and lock downs put in place in 1918. Hell you can see people on the streets in photos wearing them. Now I will say there was a hell of a lot more people wearing them wrong (not covering the nose because they didn't think you had to, to stop diseases from getting in), so they were pretty much not that effective. This is the crux of this whole sub this "new normal" that you keep trying to fight so hard to prevent happened already and when it was all over then we went back to old normal there is precedent that this will end eventually albeit with some changes from before you can't just expect a worldwide pandemic to have no effect but in general life does go back to normal you just have to be patient.</p>

        <p>Covid probables were added to the covid positive numbers since jump street.  Jesus man - I guess I really do have to spell every single little thing out because you're not even capable of seeing that connection.</p>
<p>There more evidence tho.<br>
Check out this undercover nurse video to see how shit is on the front lines.<br>

<p>Don't change the subject.  Stick with America - it's where we have the data and it does matter.  Yes all those other countries also matter and are also skewing the numbers.  There's more evidence but it's a rabbit hole you're obviously unwilling to go down.</p>
<p>&rt; That's something else you can't answer what motive does the US have. </p>
<p>OH I can most certainly answer that point.  You don't speak for me and you should be far less willing to jump to conclusions than you are.</p>
<p>&rt; That was really the point I was getting at with the whole tb point. There is no point for the US to fake covid, at least no point that wouldn't have also made sense to do decades ago with tb.</p>
<p>YES there is - vaccinations and the money to be made from them.  It's MASSIVE and there's also other side benefits.</p>
<p>Here's one vid that explains the links and what's going on globally - there are many others.
https://www.bit_chute.com/video/1Z5VYqJqrtI/<br>
(remove the underscore)</p>
<p>&rt; And as for the spreads faster. Yes it does. Tb you have to start showing symptoms to really start spreading it. Covid you can feel fine for two weeks and be spreading it the whole time. Or be asymptomatic and be spreading it for about a month. That's just basic logical reasoning that one is a hell of a lot more easy to spread than the other.</p>
<p>See you're so indoctrinated you're not even thinking clearly - how did this asymptomatic spreader narrative start?</p>
<p>It started because of testing - they tested people and they came back as positive but the people were like "WTF? I wasn't even sick"</p>
<p>Rather than critically examine the testing - people started saying "Oh look you can be asymptomatic and spread the fucking thing" and in the fear laden environment around this virus, that narrative caught on like and spread like a wildfire.</p>
<p>BUT some have been challenging the efficacy of the testing.  What were they testing, did it make sense?
Here's a medical doctor explaining why the testing is BS<br>
https://www.bit_chute.com/video/3SGegBmtZ1He/ <br>
(remove the underscore)</p>
<p>Bottom line, they're testing for things everyone already has.  So the asymptomatic spreader narrative is bullshit.</p>
<p>&rt; Finally the pandemic this one is most closely associated with the 1918 pandemic.</p>
<p>No that narrative also got started early on to drive the fear response and has simply been embraced ever since.</p>
<p>However look at that pandemic and ask yourself, what saved everyone?</p>
<p>Cleanliness!  </p>
<p>When the links to the disease were discovered, simply cleaning shit up helped eradicate a transmission mechanism.  Couple that with herd immunity and BAM, virus over.  Same thing will happen here but not with lock downs and social distancing.</p>
<p>There's suppression of evidence for a reason - they're trying to vaccinate everyone why?  Because they  make BILLIONS off of vaccines and they get away liability free.  Fucking US Govt gave AstraZenica immunity from the outcomes of a vaccine.  Fucking bullshit is what that is.</p>
<p>But you seem to only want to explore the accepted narrative.  It doesn't make you right at all.</p>

<p>Also where on either of those sheets did it say probables are to be counted as covid cases. Just because there is a guideline for determining who is likely to have it doesn't mean shit. </p>
<p>It's not changing the subject this is a global issue. It's part of the problem with this subs whole logic. Why would pretty much every other country in the world be doing the same thing america is trying to do. </p>
<p>Also it's frustrating whenever you bring up a point to the contrary it's always always always something along the lines of "your indoctrinated" or "the numbers are fake".</p>
<p>Here is what you sound like: 2+2=5. Nope it doesn't matter what your calculator says it's programed by the government to brainwash you into thinking that it's actually 4 when it's 5. 2 over from 2 isn't 4 you are just counting wrong. </p>
<p>You can believe anything so long as you dismiss any and all facts that anyone else has as propaganda or indoctrination. Notice how I haven't dismissed a single one of your points as that but you have to me. It's because unlike you I choose to defend my points even from facts that make it hard for me to. </p>
<p>Yes finally of course business are going to benefit from a vaccine but that doesn't mean that diseases just don't exist and that we don't need to protect people from them. A fact that you didn't address is that 50 million people had to die before we had enough antibodies built up. 1 in 3 people had to get it. Are you really saying we should subject people to that again. Seriously there is a powerful as hell documentary made in the 90s where people from that time period tall about what it was like and if I can find it for free online I will link it.</p>

        <p>&rt; A probable case or death is defined by one of the following:</p>
<p>Meeting clinical criteria AND epidemiologic evidence with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19</p>
<p>Meeting presumptive laboratory evidence AND either clinical criteria OR epidemiologic evidence</p>
<p>Meeting vital records criteria with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID19</p>
<p>Same source you just linked me. </p>
<p>See thats not supportive at all of your texas or arizona claims. Because they consider probable different what the cdc claims. All that that means is texas is telling doctors that people who have symptoms should be considered probable. That doesn't mean they are being counted by the cdc it means that the doctors should treat the patients like they have covid which is the smart thing to do you dolt.</p>
<p>As for what these criteria means is that you have to litteraly show every symptom of covid-19 and only lack testing. I mean if you are showing every symptom including the lost of taste and smell that is the defining difference between covid and the flu. Then it's probably smart to assume they have covid. Its like looking at someone who has very obvious bullet wound in their head and a gun 10 feet away from them and saying "I believe sir that this person was shot" no you don't technically have the proof till you pull the bullet out of his head but it's pretty smart to assume. </p>
<p>Also it is up to hospitals to report their numbers to the government. So if what you are saying is true then it's a hospital conspiracy not a government one.</p>

        <p>I am an adult. You are cherry picking parts of quotes to make your argument which is ironic give you accused me of pulling shit out of my ass. The reason why this goes against your texas and arizona thing is because the cdc counts probable as one thing and those states consider probable another thing. The cdc doesn't count what texas and arizona consider probable they count what the cdc considers probable. Those vital records criteria are not made up by the states but by the cdc. Here is one such criteria (this one specifically stating when a probable covid 19 can can be listed as cause of death ) https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/vsrg/vsrg03-508.pdf</p>
<p>(You may have to download the PDF ) </p>
<p>When you read the criteria it pretty much states that you need to show all the symptoms of covid to be considered a probable case. </p>
<p>Also you included this as part of the quote and I am not sure if you were calling this bs too but lost of taste and smell is one of the biggest differences between covid in the flu you can Google the symptoms yourself for that bit. </p>
<p>Also lastly pulling the I am older so I am wiser or smarter card is litteraly dumb. Intelligence levels are not based on age. There are geniuses like bill gates who was intelligent enough to get scholarships to harvard when he was 18. And then you have this sub filled with people who are both older and younger than 18 who all have the mental capacity of a newborn. It just doesn't make sense to pull the age card.</p>

        <p>Dumbass I showed you one of the criteria that the cdc uses because that one was simply the easiest to find. the whole point of showing you that is to show you proof that what the cdc meant by "criteria" was the criteria they use not the one other states use. Litteraly it does not fucking matter what an individual state says is a probable case whether for death or for just CASES. </p>
<p>IT LITTERALY WOULD NOT MATTER IF A STATE SAID BLINKING MADE YOU COVID PROBABLE THE CDC WOULDN'T REPORT YOU AS SUCH UNTIL YOU MET THE CDC CRITERIA. </p>
<p>That's what matters the cdc criteria. I showed you one of many different criteria that the cdc provides. I don't know how many ways I can say it but the cdc doesn't give two shits about what an individual state lists as a probable case. </p>
<p>&rt; You aren't an adult in your arguing/logic skills</p>
<p>Says the one admitting to cherry picking. When you want to prove a statement wrong you must prove the whole statement wrong. When you dismiss facts as "indoctrination" that isn't proving the statement wrong that's putting your fingers in your ears and going lalalalala not listening. </p>
<p>That's the whole reason why you can say I haven't accurately refuted your claims because Everytime I do you just say that's "following a narrative" or "indoctrination" you want to call me a sheep but yet you are the one spouting the same phrases and buzz words over and over again. Do you not see the irony in that.</p>

        <p>Masks also are effective at concealing people’s identity. I like that aspect of it because I got tired of being harassed by the cops all of the time. It took my parole officer a week to decide if I needed to wear my mask in the courthouse because he can’t tell us parolees apart. </p>
<p>We got a partner of mine who was in for rape. They should never let that dude wear a mask. Bad idea.</p>

        <p>I mean, we are talking about in total, not in a certain country. TB has around 20,000 cases per year in the US while Covid has 200,000 which is around 10x more in under a year. Covid is just more contagious. Also as other people have said, TB is a bacterial infection and can, in most cases, be fought with antibiotics and there is a vaccine available so many people are already immune so lockdowns are unnecessary as they are intended to slow down the spread of a virus without a vaccine. Also to respond to a response by u/meggyAnnP , there is no evidence of face coverings causing bacterial infections in people who wear them so mask up and stay safe. There is more benefit than harm in wearing facemasks</p>

        <p>No - you've fallen for the "Cases matter" fallacy.</p>
<p>When you have states like Texas and Arizona literally classifying people as Covid positive for simply having a cough, A COUGH, that's it....then you've massively skewed the number of infections.</p>
<p>Here's the proof - and notice the similar language and the date of the change.  Correlate it to the increase in numbers shortly after.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/1AJWJHe">Texas Proof</a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/01GQYGG">AZ Proof</a></p>
<p>There are other states that have likely done the same.  </p>
<p>The similar language is enough to know that this is being directed from "on high".</p>
<p>Now couple all that with multiple reports of non-elimination of repeat testing and you can easily see how a spike in cases occurs.  This means if you have tested positive but get retested 2, 3 or more times, then each time you're tested you're an individual case.  If you test positive 3 different times, you're reported as 3 Covid positive cases instead of 1 like you should be.  </p>
<p>Ignore the case numbers, they're fabricated and have been since jump street.</p>

        <p>Don't you think its a bit anticlimactic for the government or medical facilities to falsify cases of covid. If you read through the criteria, the cases accepted also need to have been in contact with someone that was posotive for covid for at least 15 minutes to meet the criteria for a case</p>

        <p>No you're misstating the information.  Read the fucking documents, not just the parts that you like.</p>
<p>In those documents it clearly states:<br>
"Travel to or residence in an area with sustained, ongoing community transmission of Covid19"</p>
<p>That could literally be 100% of USA cities.</p>
<p>It's vague language with ZERO definition of what sustained, ongoing community transmission actually means.  So there's no objective criteria.  One rural city could literally say "Oh yeah we live in the USA so there's sustained, ongoing transmission here." and BAM anyone with a cough is now Covid positive and the numbers get reported.</p>
<p>It's a fucking ridiculous standard.</p>

        <p>Right hear me out, third word countries with alot of people in em and not so great health care. China, India those types of places right, they are going to massively sway numbers for those types of places. Hell people in say China already wear masks because it fucked 24/7 over there. </p>
<p>Now hows all that tie into covid and all this? Simple, it's hitting third and first world countries just as hard. Hence why masks need to be mandated for countries around the world. </p>
<p>In the end, not wearing a mask is fucking stupid and if you don't do it you literally don't vaccinate children you mentally deficient toddlers</p>

        <p>Masks help to slow or mitigate transmission of particular matter from one person to another... </p>
<p>This combined with a fun fact: immunity for this virus is temporary... Which is bad for a vaccine as it will require everyone to take the vaccine (90% or more) in order to squash the pandemic.</p>

        <p>No that's a false statistic - the death numbers have been skewed since jump street.</p>
<p>The US govt set up a scale to reimburse hospitals for treating covid 19 and the more people were classified as Covid+ the higher the reimbursements.  Then they shut down the main money making activities for the hospitals.  </p>
<p>So what do you think the hospitals will do?  Classify any death they can reasonably get away with as having died from Covid 19.  But there's a big different of dying WITH something and dying FROM it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/state-by-state-breakdown-of-federal-aid-per-covid-19-case.html">State by state breakdown of Federal Aid</a></p>
<p>This was happening all over the country with reports of car crash and motorcycle crash deaths being reported as dying from Covid19.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblaze.com/conservative-review/horowitz-illinois-health-director-anyone-covid-positive-diagnosis-listed-covid-19-death">Here's one example</a> where the Illinois Heath Director is giving instructions and setting policy as to how they're skewing the numbers.</p>
<p>And then when you take into account that <a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/new-cdc-report-shows-94-of-us-covid-deaths-had-contributing-conditions-heres-what-that-means/33854593#">94% of deaths reported by CDC had other co-morbidities</a> but were counted as Covid deaths, you start to realize the death numbers have been total manipulated and skewed.</p>
