        <p>Illness always comes from within--your thoughts, what you eat, what you drink, the toxins; these are what cause illness. The only thing your body can do is expel morbid matter. This is what we call symptoms and suppression of this natural process (by use of antiemetics, etc.) leads to chronic disease.</p>
<p>What we call cold happens yearly because the body, on a cyclical basis, is signaled to dump mass stored toxins. This occurs at the cellular level. Climate/seasonal changes bring about humidity and temperature changes which increase bioactive functions of cells, through moisture and/or oxygen absorption. These biochemical signals cause cells to release stored toxins—it is cellular processes being maintained through cell survival mechanisms; a sort of house cleaning. Bacterium also increases during colder months, as they flourish in the blood due to a lowered bodily temperature. When they proliferate, they feed upon debris in the tissue and blood. </p>
<p>When they consume such matter, they excrete it into a utilizable form for white blood cells and other cleansing cells, such as phagocytes, to further eliminate and or recycle for use by the body. The body discards 90% of toxins through the skin. The rest expel via the bowels, mouth, and mucus membranes. Depending upon the toxicity and nature of those substances, parasites or fungus may be utilized to help break them down. But when substances are too toxic for these living microbial agents to consume without dying, a non-living agent must be created by the body as a last resort.</p>
<p>A person may experience viral or bacterial detoxifications regularly if they continually toxify their body. Even in healthy people, we can expect to have mild colds every so often. Bacterial colds are necessary to help us break down toxins we may have picked up from air, food, or water sources. They also serve to strengthen the overall body. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>This is a situation where you would do well to provide a specific end-to-end example in furtherance of proving your point. If possible, a clear example of the lifetime of the rhino virus or something we can all relate to would help. Maybe, don't bother editing in this case, but do consider how you might definitively prove your point in the future.</p>
<p>Being told how something works in the general case isn't enough for me to run off an independently verify anything :).</p>
<p>Irregardless of whether you're right, you're still bringing something worth discussing to the table. That's orders of magnitude better than the name calling bullshit I see everywhere else. Congrats.</p>

        <p>If this is a troll post, consider me trolled. If not, it is extremely obvious you have next to zero understanding of immunology or human biology. Reading this felt like listening to a 10 year old try to explain how a nuclear reactor works. I’m legitimately curious where you receive your “information.” Did you just make this up? Knowingly spreading false information is unethical, and trying to explain processes you don’t understand to people who may not recognize how blatantly incorrect you are is irresponsible. You are trying to cram an evidence-based medicine shaped peg into a naturopathic hole, and it simply does not fit. Stop being lazy and take the time to educate yourself with information from legitimate scientific sources, not some naturopathic quack you watched on YouTube or your friend’s friend on Facebook.</p>

        <p>This information should  spread more, but sadly alot of peoples are self-suficient or unable to understand the details. I for one, one year ago had no idea about virology / microbiology, i just followed my instinct that China / Italy / Japan triangle made no sense  (while Italy was booming - Japan had no problems despite scientists speaking about ACE3 receptors bla bla, prooving that Italy was used as a scare tactic because they were 2nd country in the world after Japan with the oldest population, so if you test them, you can transform alot of the usual deaths to Covid19 and claim it`s a pandemic, while japan refused to do this because their pm Abe was smart). So yeah, i knew it`s fake since March last year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After that i started to learn what proteins are, how viruses act and such. But im prolly an exception, because alot of peoples don`t even know what a cell is (they think u put prisoners in them). So it`s hard for them to understand how RT-PCR protocols work.Funny enough, not even those that test daily do, because they got their orders from scientists on how to use them, and they just act like robots, no questions asked.</p>

        <p>The number of times you need to amplify a protein/virus fragment to get the whole virus.  </p>
<p>Let`s  say the virus fragment is a seed .. The whole virus is an apple. Each  cycle makes the seed grow more and more untill it becomes an apple.  </p>
<p>Problem  is, up to date there is no apple, so no one knows how many cycles it  takes to prove the exists. But after a certain treshhold, like 27  cycles ... no matter what u amplify, it will show you as an apple. This  way u get alot of positives and u can claim it`s a pandemic, when in  reality it`s not even a virus. They used this method based on 1-2 scientists and W.H.O`s orders, and silenced the others who knew it`s not ok. The inventor of RT-PCR himself, said that this method is not ok for coronaviruses .. and HIV since we`re talking about this.</p>

        <p>The way PCR works is they take a small sample and then amplify it so they can run tests on it. It's like a generation cycle of DNA multiplying and becoming big enough. But the more cycles you do the bigger the final result that is tested for disease, and the less accurate it becomes. Think of taking a small image and upscaling it with AI. It's generally good but do it too much you'll start seeing artifacts.</p>

        <p>A cycle refers to the genetic material (DNA) being exponentially amplified. The DNA double strand is split and forms two single strands, each of which can be rebuilt into two double strands. It's called a cycle because the heat of the reaction is changed in cycles to encourage the splitting and rebuilding.</p>
<p>Results are drawn as a sigmoidal curve. Positive or negative is determined by if the curve reaches a certain threshold value within a certain number of cycles. That's where the cycle numbers are coming in. </p>
<p>Because it is an exponential process, if you repeat the cycles enough you will absolutely pass the threshold eventually, even if the target material is not present in the sample. Also note this process cannot account for the viability of the specimen; that genetic material could come from a living or dead virus or even free nucleic acids in the environment.</p>

        <p>I have seen them claiming different PCR tests lead to different results, so keeping track of cycle counts is irrelevant or unhelpful.</p>
<p>Meanwhile all PCR tests have almost entirely overlapping properties, with the cycle count always doubling the genetic material previously present, meaning Ct continues to be incredibly relevant even with different regents\sequencing involved.</p>

        <p>Anyone with normal intelligence and a working layman's understanding of the PCR testing methodology and constraints can tell it is an obvious lie.</p>
<p>Cycle count is the most important single parameter to record. More important than the alleged test results themselves because without the Ct value, you cannot tell if the test was run at a reasonable Ct under 30.</p>

        <p>Cycle = time period. Each time period doubles the ammount of DNA in a sample, then DNA sequencing is used to detect the DNA markers the chinese labs provided 14 months ago as 'the gold standard'. When scientists say 'gold standard' it usually means they know they are making a bunch of un-scientific assumptions based on the assumptions in the 'gold standard'. This is one of those cases. 'Its not my junk science. It is all based on the gold standard'. (i do hope some scientist comes along to challenge me on this brash statement)</p>
<p>The issue is that the 'covid genome' being used in the sequencing part is actually a partial list of genes that old flus\colds can also trigger once amplified with PCR.</p>
<p>This means the CDC memos going out to raise and lower PCR cycles can be seen as a thermostat to control number of cases for political purposes. As we see evidence of in this twitter screengrab.</p>
<p>Wish there was a link to both the tweet and the CDC page tho.</p>

<p>Where are you getting this number? I see 90% most places in a search I just did. If the reduction is 90% that is roughly the same as the increase in false positives from PCR cycles at 35 to 45.</p>
<p>This entire thing is likely a test being done. It is a psyop. 5th generation warfare. iMF\wto style economic hitjob, but on 'ourselves' this time.</p>

        <p>Unless the PCR test cycles play a larger role in 'a diagnosis' than is admitted?</p>
<p>What if tests run below 30 virtually NEVER amplify enough old coronavirus to trick the PCR test, but testing at 45 cycles creates about 80% false positives?</p>

        <p>The problem is that we're not testing for anything of material value to positive health outcomes. So what if we know you have corona virus? That doesn't help you get better.</p>
<p>IANAD. There's your disclaimer.</p>
<p>Renin-angiotensin appears to be one of the systems impacted by SARS as well as the vaccines. I want to hear about ACE inhibitors, BP medication, blood thinners, adrenal disorders, ischemic attacks, auto-immune disorders, and the testing that doctors can do to determine that none of these factors are a concern. So far, I've seen, heard, and read absolutely squat. Just stuff about fertility and "long covid". Bullshit, this isn't helpful information.</p>
<p>Given that all enzymatic activity in the body depends on bi-phasic "stuff" to maintain a balance, I can only assume that destroying receptors or enzymes would have similar side effect profiles to intentional down or up regulating enzymatic activity, irregardless of how that's achieved. Peptides kick the whole thing off, has anyone looked at secondary effects there? I've read that ACE inhibitors used for life threatening post-heart-problems are very likely to cause Alzheimer's over a period of many years because of the change in oxygen saturation levels that comes with having your blood vessels manipulated.</p>
<p>I want a technical person who hasn't thrown out their biology texts to walk me through this. To date, the only accessible answers I've seen dodge the question, fail to answer anything, and/or descend into name calling.</p>

        <p>The problem is that it is a Globalist Coup in the IMF\WTO economic hitjob mold, but with this thick new layer of neoliberal putsch.</p>
<p>The problem is that this is the dramatic end of western civilization and history, and the rise of some sort of monstrous global dystopia predicated on the rebranded seasonal flu.</p>
<p>I want someone to explain to me why people with the vaccine are going to have their PCR tests run at fewer cycles. Over on Twitter some guy is responding to every single person saying "the lower cycles is for sequencing!", but not providing much more information.</p>
<p>What I do not get is why, under any logical regime, the people who can be expected to have a lower viral load are now being tested with fewer cycles. It appears to be a double whammy of 'under-detection' as compared to the non-vaxed group who continue to have the non-scientific 45x+ PCR cycles run?</p>

        <p>No, it's not the end. Do you win a war by winning every battle?</p>
<p>EOW predictions fall into the same camp as assuming a "new normal". You don't need to carry that baggage with you if you're a person who is pushing for people to understand. Or, put another way, the best way to get into a car accident is to focus on the trees on the side of the road. You're already going 100mph. Maybe the bump in front of you is more important than the storm above you?</p>
<p>My implied argument, which I should've stated explicitly, is that the battle over PCR meaning anything was lost a long time ago. Nobody gets it, and it should be obvious why. It's a technical test. People are having trouble digesting rules. You expect them to understand a test?</p>
<p>The next place to draw a line is with real world health conditions that impact everyone. There's an opportunity to put a hard stop to this nonsense if it's found that medication interactions with the vaccine are problematic, and so on.</p>
<p>Will this work to stop "the new normal"? No, probably not. But I guarantee you most people won't connect historical reality to present day tyranny.</p>
<p>IDK man. Trying to find a way to get around this like everyone else.</p>

        <p>100% no argument -- just tips. Take 'em or leave 'em :). My favourite docs come directly from https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/ so you don't need to convince me.</p>
<p>My initial experience with the reality of things was a remote friend in the Netherlands. He was made homeless digitally some 15 years ago on account of being a kid who screwed up his taxes once. He thought health care contributions were optional on account of having sick parents that misled him. It caused him to fall through so many cracks that I learned something both shitty AND new from his lived experience every day.</p>

        <p>We also keep testing patients that we know are going to test positive because they were positive less than a month ago or similar. I think this is causing the rates to look higher than they actually are since the same patient's data is contributing more than once.</p>

        <p>You guys need to decide if covid cases are way higher or way lower than claimed. You somehow manage to claim both that it's harmless because there are so many cases (supposedly 500million cases by september 2020) vs deaths, <strong>but also</strong> that there are actually loads of false positives.<br>
But false positives would make the resulting deaths a much larger share of the actual number of infections, and drive up the real fatality rate. Can't have it both ways, guys.</p>
<p>If 96.5% of tests done so far are false positives there's only been around 1 million Covid cases in the US, but there are still 600k covid deaths. And you think we're 'doomers' when confronted with a virus that according to you has a 60% IFR? That's a higher IFR than the big African ebola outbreak.</p>
