    <strong>Europe on the ground?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m trying to understand what it’s like on the ground in Europe. Hearing protests in Italy, and England. Is the resistance widespread? Is everyone over it? Is the fear mongering working? Are businesses complying?</p>
<p>What about Germany and France? I know France instituted lockdowns again. Are people lying down for it? Give me the scoop, guys!</p></p>

        <p>I'm in England.  We went into national lockdown about a week ago.</p>
<p>Businesses are, for the most part, complying.  Pub and restaurants and gyms were forced to close, shops can stay open if they sell essential goods (e.g. food and medication), and some shops have started <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54908127">exploiting loopholes</a> so that they fall into that category.  </p>
<p>People aren't complying.  We aren't allowed to visit each others homes, or gather outside with more than one other person from outside our household, and pretty much everyone I know has been violating these regulations regularly.  There are plenty of outdoor food markets <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/londons-broadway-market-packed-despite-lockdown/">which have been doing a roaring trade</a>, and people are buying beers and wine from the off license and sitting outside (weather is nicer than usual is Southern England for this time of year) and trying to make the most of it.  We are only allowed out of our homes for exercise, education, medical needs, or trips to buy essentials, but traffic is not far off what it was last week.</p>

        <p>I’ve also seen quite a few businesses on Instagram (mainly gyms) that are doing all they can to stay open despite being visited constantly by the police and environmental health. Check out @gainzbedford</p>

        <p>Wish I could ask the same question about America, nope. Just a bunch of pussies who love submitting to covid mandates</p>
<p>Wish my country could grow a pair, just it did before covid came to our country.</p>

        <p>Business are getting paid to some extend for the lockdown that's why protests aren't extensive yet. Therefore probably ECB has the printing press running 24/7 to "mask" the situation</p>
<p>Many people are fined with some crappy excuses when they go out of their houses or if they refuse to damage their health with masks or they decide to visit their relatives or friends. In some countries  </p>
<p>I asked about those fines given to people, in some countries I was told they push them as part of the taxes they need to pay at the end of the fiscal year. That's the other scam I guess, because going out, walking, living your life is now also extra taxed. Much worse than the mafia business.</p>
