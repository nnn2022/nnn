    <strong>Anyone notice how much sloppier the lies are getting?</strong>
    <p><p>Feels like in 2020 they put more effort into hiding their true agenda, but now in 2021, we've got Hancock openly being a hypocrite (before being replaced by sajid javid in the UK), then the G7 Summit where the elites openly laughed at the public by "social distancing" on the camera, then once the cameras were off, they immediately went back to normal (even if they were vaccinated, apparently there are still rules like hotel quarantine for some places, but apparently they broke all of their own rules)</p>
<p>Then Australian news even openly said "New World Order" without even caring: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ohnhyz/today_is_the_first_full_day_of_the_new_world/</p>
<p>Which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Their Endgame is near, and they have no use to hide anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They don't have to hide it. Even when they've been openly talking about "The New World Order" apparently the public is too dumb to realize something is wrong and still think all of this is about health. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I honestly think that even the corrupt politicians were surprised and didn't expect how easy it was to fool the public, so they're being more careless now?</p></p>
