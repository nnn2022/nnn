    <strong>Pulling apart BBC scaremongering headline "Delta variant hospital cases nearly double in England" and the data they use inside the article.</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanted to show that when you quote numbers and use scary headlines... they mean nothing without context.  </p>
<p><strong>Cases:</strong></p>
<p>Claim:  "<em>A total of</em> <strong><em>806 people</em></strong> <em>in England have been admitted to hospital with the  Delta variant of Covid-19 as of 14 June, new figures show"</em>  </p>
<p>In the UK the actual number, correct as at September 2019, is that there are <strong>1,257 hospitals</strong> in the <strong>UK.</strong> So that <strong>0.64 people</strong> per hospital in the UK after a positive PCR test... and we all know the issues with the PCR test and the cycle threshold they are utilizing in the UK.   </p>
<p><strong>Deaths:</strong><br>
Claim: "<em>As  of 14 June, there have been 73 deaths in England of people who were  confirmed as having the Delta variant and who died within 28 days of a  positive test.</em></p>
<p><em>Of the 73 deaths:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>34 (47%) were unvaccinated</em>     </li>
<li><em>10 (</em><strong><em>14%</em></strong><em>) were more than 21 days after their first dose of vaccine</em>     </li>
<li><em>26 (</em><strong><em>36%</em></strong><em>) were more than 14 days after their second dose"</em>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, I wanted to highlight that <strong>34 +10 +26 = 70 deaths, not 73</strong>. So I'm unsure where the other 3 are classed. As you are either unvaccinated or vaccinated. I'm unclear how someone falls outside these 3 categories. Please some highlight this to me if i have missed something.  <br>
(Edit: the 3 people are likely to have died less than 21 days after the first and less than 14 days after the second dose. My bad I missed that)</p>
<p>But more importantly i wanted to highlight that <strong>50% (14%+36%)</strong> of the people who have died have had at least 1 vaccination. They claim this vaccine 'prevents serious illness and death', they claim this vaccine is 'our path to freedom'.  At the time of writing this they claim <strong>63.1%</strong> of the UK population are fully vaccinated and <strong>45.7%</strong> have had 1 dose. If these vaccines were in the 90% effective range as they claim then why are we seeing 50% of deaths from vaccinated people?   </p>
<p>This clearly doesn't add up at all. I don't have the answers but <strong>we should all be asking these questions</strong>.</p></p>

        <p>The BBC is an absolute disgrace, as a publicly funded company they have a duty to be impartial, there should be a petition to remove the license fee requirement immediately</p>
<p>The figures are like always, absolutely no context behind them, in 2019 during the winter months an average of 3000 people a day are admitted to UK hospitals with respiratory illness</p>
<p>yet all you see is a headline screaming 200 more covid admissions, they had an article in December that talked about the NHS being at "breaking point" due to covid and at the very bottom past all the adverts etc was one line saying admissions were 20% down on the same time in 2019</p>

        <p>I stopped paying the license fee in 2009. Nothing happened. You will get a some letters and you may receive a visit from "enforcement agents" who have no authority at all, they can not come in your house unless you let them. So just stop paying it.</p>
<p>I will never understand why anyone continues to pay it since it came out that the BBC were protecting Jimmy Saville for decades while he raped children in their hospital beds and fucked corpses.</p>

        <p>Probably depends on a specific socioecological environment (pan troglodytes proactive political games over status (Goodness Paradox), fertile females and offspring compared to pan paniscus (bonobo) society based on playful prosociality for promotion of group stability regardless of age and gender. Or human society after the agricultural/pastoral revolution leading to competitive possessiveness over private property (marriage,  amatonormativity), inheritance, virginity, fertility  cults and maximization of birth rates regardless of ideologies such as antinatalism based on consent. Not sure about Trobrianders, Etoro, Sambia people, Gebusi, Ache, Batek, Mosuo and all the extinct undocumented egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies with different effects on epigenetic expression.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure if the EMA or PHE have ever explicitly stated how effective the COVID vaccines are. It seems to just be the CDC that does that.</p>
<p>And, yes, I think the CDC is knowingly lying about the effectiveness of the vaccines.</p>

        <p>A claim has been Delta might 'escape' the vaccine easier, though god knows which is the truth and which the bluff there. We do know the first dose alone isn't as effective, and the effectiveness can be less in older people - because their own immune system isn't responding as well. Which was inevitable. Same problem with the flu vaccines.</p>
<p>What I'd like to know is the ages/existing state of health.</p>

        <p>If you are genuinely searching for answers, here's a couple to get you started.</p>
<p>-Firstly, make sure you're being fair with the data and your questioning. For example, you are framing your statistics as the percentage of people who have had at least 1 vaccination. But data/advice in the UK has been clear that two doses are required to provide good protection, especially against the current Delta variant. This is well communicated, so you don't really have good justification for just blindly combining the two groups for your analysis to skew it in favour of what I assume is your pre-chosen outcome.</p>
<p>-Secondly, and more importantly, vaccine uptake is extremely high, especially in the most vulnerable populations who will be making up the majority of deaths. Over 95% of people aged 80 or older have received both doses, and figures are similarly high in other at-risk groups. So if the vaccines are not effective at reducing deaths, then in a sample of covid deaths we should expect to see a similarly high proportion of people who have received both doses. The fact that actually only 36% of people had received both doses is actually pretty good evidence that it is an effective method of reducing deaths.</p>

        <p>I haven't provided a political argument, I've provided simple maths. I'm very happy to engage in a conversation about the merits of it but it doesn't really make sense to reply to maths with a clown emoji.</p>
<p>If the percentage of people who are vaccinated in the overall population is larger than in the sample of deaths, that is literally proof that vaccination is linked with a decreased chance of death. And that's just taking the OP's figures at face value and not considering the absolutely huge additional factor that there is currently a very strong relationship between vaccinations and being in a high risk group of covid death.</p>
