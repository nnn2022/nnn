        <p>I also think the idea is bad and I don't want a new normal. I would've liked my teachers stopped wearing masks so I could understand what's being said, but if they insists wearing COVID19 outfits I could at least attempt lip reading if they wears this instead of the black face covering. I don't support fish bowls. Lips are just more readable with fish bowls than face covering.</p>

        <p>This is dumb as shit, but if the choice is between this and masks, I'd rather the shields be the standard.  At least you can still read lips and see facial expressions through a clear shield.</p>

        <p>I've been seeing much more hostility and rejection of face shields recently, so that probably won't happen. Same with mesh masks, and the like.</p>
<p>The real endgame, it seems, is to hide people's expressions, in order to dehumanize them. Not sure why people here continue to act like dehumanization is "impossible", and that "they" would never do that.</p>

        <p>The goal is absolutely, 100%, dehumanization.  And it's working.  Every person is nothing more than a carrier of illness.  Do not touch other people, do not speak to other people.  The human face is a symbol of disease and death.  Fear your fellow man, and fear yourself, because you may be a carrier of disease and not even know it.  And people lap this shit right up.  It's disgusting.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I get frustrated when people around here say this is what's happening. It's all just a "flub", and just politicians trying to make people feel safe. At this point, it's very clear, they are after more top-down control of the world's population. The masks are really no different a symbol than the likes of badges Jewish people were forced to wear back during the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>I don't think those of you who attack me personally have actually read the article.</p>
<p>Even though I could learn a lot in the time I have spent here about those who think masks are slavery or portray a crisis of humanity that has cost human lives as a lie or dismiss it as a harmless flu, I feel pity for the individuals who are fighting a battle here every day of their lives that does not exist. You are no heroes. You are not the resistance against fascism, it is not for you to compare yourselves with those who risked their lives in the fight against Nazi oppression. </p>
<p>I will not argue with you here, for wiser than I, with better arguments than mine, have tried this, and you have called them liars, cheats, and idiots. If you would believe the facts and science, you would not be here. I do not ask you to change your mind, but only to show some respect to our fellow humans. </p>
<p>Those who read this here and are open to otherd arguments: Pay attention to whose side you stand. </p>
<p>Downvote me, if you think that this changes anything. As long as the rational ones are in the majority and politics is guided by numbers, I hope that we as humanity will learn something from this pandemic.</p>

        <p>Why come on here in the first place then, to be attacked for deliberately antagonising people, surely you knew this would happen, do you see it as a kind of sport for you to lecture people you consider your inferiors, to impress them with you articulate command of the English language. I would not call you a liar or a cheat, perhaps I will be generous and call you missguided and unwilling, or unable to see past the Governments narratives.</p>
<p>Perhaps we only see what we want to see and you see from a bias that is different to mine, the 'double slit experiment' comes to mind.</p>
<p>As far as the facts and science are concerned we do not believe it, does not mean we do not believe in good science, just bad science when it is faked to support an agenda, Ah Sweden.</p>
<p>A significant number of the death certs have been found to have been faked and countries have been given millions in bribes to push this oppression. </p>
<p>It's there if you search for it, it's not conspiracy sites either, you can find it on established news sites that are not CNN.</p>
<p>The numbers are just the same as normal flu deaths, miraculously not as many people seemed to have died from cancer or heart attacks this year, they were renamed covid deaths.</p>
<p>It's not about science, medicine or a disease, it's about control and the hurting of humanity and there is plenty of science to say mask wearing is ineffective, the WHO cannot make its mind up on that one either.</p>
<p>So I do hope that humanity will learn something and that something is to see past this fake pandemic and to see how it is being programmed into their psyches so they become more pliable into accepting the continued oppression of humanity that could be their future if they do not resist now.</p>

        <p>No. Individual liberties are a good thing. Collectivism is a bad thing. Contrary to your irrational fear of a new strain of the common cold - which has a death rate of less than 0.5%, is only a real danger to those already near death, and is most certainly not a danger to the human race as a whole - collectivism will indeed kill us all. Individual liberty and diversity of thought is just as important as genetic diversity in preventing our extinction. Collectivism is monoculture of the mind, incest of the soul. The liberty to live and die as we please is paramount to our survival as a species.</p>
