    <strong>The Tragedy of the Cage</strong>
    <p><p>The Tragedy of the Cage</p>
<p>Kids are adapting and surviving in these hard times.  We the compassionate ones who love them are making sure that they stay home, so we can keep them safe from others and others safe from them.  Kids who are socially isolated are only suicidal if you use a measure of expressed thoughts of killing themselves or emergency room visits for suicide attempts.  But, really, they are largely not successful in killing themselves, so these are just the growing pains of adaptation and overcoming.  I mean, if they are alive (even if they can't see friends, can't play sports, are failing over twice as much as they have ever before in academics), then this is clear evidence that they are surviving and overcoming.  Virtual distance learning may be an all day effort, but don't let failure at it suggest that it is experienced as, nor serves as a measure of their intelligence or potential.  They may be failing computer school, but these measures are just silly to pay attention to.  They don't mean anything!  As a parent who keeps my child home for safety, I don't really care about outdated school measures anyway.  I just tell them that this is a system of the white and wealthy, and, sticks and stones may break your bones, but grades will never hurt you.  Besides, school is just a day job.  It doesn't matter what you do with your time; it matters that you are alive at all.  </p>
<p>I think it is the same with the families visiting their elderly relatives through windows at the nursing homes.  They aren't sad, nor lonely, and why measure such things when it's not what is important anyways?  Their suffering is really just adaptation and overcoming. That isn't suffering at all!  Tears shed are just growing pains! Some parents are mistaken in thinking that their kids should be able to see their friends, and that they even need it.  This is not a need.  Real need is the need not to die of COVID.  That is real need.  It may not be the only need, but it is the most important one, and the one worth measuring.  Anyone who pretends to care about their children should stop measuring, even qualitatively, and certainly not subjectively, their mental well-being and depressive behaviors; at least they are not dying nor causing others to die. </p>
<p>That's the great thing about caged animals, in zoos and so on.  For example, you can have a beautiful rare tiger, and essentially keep it free from contagious disease that can be easily spread amongst these special tigers.  You can make sure that it will never fight with another tiger nor receive scratches nor bites.  You can also protect other animals from the tiger, because tigers are dangerous to other life.  This is the kindest and safest thing to do for both the tigers and all other animals.  You can make sure that the cage is small enough that they won't get too tired from running, won't trip over unknown and dangerous terrain.  Some people say that stereotypies like pacing back and forth for hours, is a sign of harm, but, honestly, you should applaud the caged tiger their ability to adapt and overcome, to survive safely because of the love of those who are all doing their best to provide these cages.   </p>
<p>My kids complain sometimes.  I know that this is not a real measure nor evidence of anything being wrong.  They are too young to even understand how they are adapting and overcoming.  That is why I tell them that this is for their own good.  That is why I tell them that it is better not to go see friends, because just think how you would feel if, by visiting a friend, you were to kill that friend's parent, or grandparent!  How would you feel then?  See?  I love my children, so I tell them that they do not need those friends.  They do not need grades.  They don't need any of those things that we used to assume were normal.  </p>
<p>I really think they're getting it, too, because they just complain less and less and just stay in their rooms and sleep.  They even say that they can imagine leaving this life and going into another life.  That is just one of those admirable stereotypies, like the tiger pacing.  I mean, they say that the other life is even more colorful and real than this one!  It's like it is just one short step away!  Just think what an incredible adaptation, to use your mind to make you free of the cage, living in a world where you have friends, a life full of possibilities of college and travel and interesting professions!  My son told me that he hopes that he can sleep again soon and go to that other life.  He's really brilliant, and capable.  I am glad that I love my children so much that I can give them this safety.  I am cheering for them, too, as they develop their ability to adapt to cages, to also overcome them.  He said that that other life is so close that he can almost come over to it.  </p>
<p>My son is like a beautiful and very special tiger.  I love hims so much!  And his claws will never be used to harm another.  I have made certain of it. In fact, since he's not really using them, they have begun to grow in a curve until they harmlessly point back at him.   Now that he is safe, we more need to watch out that he's not the one that they cut!  Ha! Ha! Can you imagine, a tiger whose claws are so safe from doing harm that they are only a danger to himself?  </p>
<p>May that we all shall overcome this day.  Every day.  May that we break the cages of ourselves and our beloved children.  May that this life here be a life worth living.  May it be lived now.  May that my tears NEVER be tears of adaptation, so much so that they will rust and rot the bars of the cages that have never been strong enough to keep me from being free.  May that the cut of the claw be worn, honed, and mediated by a dignified passage through the world, as has been the way of the tiger forever. May we be dangerous in our dignity, so dangerous that none dare entrap our children nor deceive us into believing that what is Good is Bad and what is Bad is Good.  We know who we are.</p>
<p>Hand to hand.  Heart to heart.  Breath to breath. Fidelity to the Friend.</p></p>
