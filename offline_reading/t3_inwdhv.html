    <strong>2010 Rockefeller Report " Predicted " The Global Lockdown And The New Normal</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://meteopolitique.com/Fiches/Vision/Analyse/Malheur/14.pdf">https://meteopolitique.com/Fiches/Vision/Analyse/Malheur/14.pdf</a> </p>
<p>Page 18 to 25 is the Operation Lockstep scenario. A scenario where a killer virus pops up in 2010 killing dozens of million in months, and how life afterwards would become like... Only problem is covid has a very tiny IFR of 0.04 % under 70 and cause of that their agenda keeps getting exposed, uprising against the agenda happened much faster and much bigger then they anticipated. I Quote :</p>
<p>During the pandemic, national leaders around the world flexed their authority and imposed airtight rules and restrictions, from the mandatory wearing of face masks to body-temperature checks at the entries to communal spaces like train stations and supermarkets.  Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even intensified. In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems — from pandemics and transnational terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty — leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power. </p>
<p>At first, the notion of a more controlled world gained wide acceptance and approval. Citizens willingly gave up some of their sovereignty — and their privacy — to more paternalistic states in exchange for greater safety and stability. Citizens were more tolerant, and even eager, for top-down direction and oversight, and national leaders had more latitude to impose order in the ways they saw fit. In developed countries, this heightened oversight took many forms: biometric IDs for all citizens, for example, and tighter regulation of key industries whose stability was deemed vital to national interests. In many developed countries, enforced cooperation with a suite of new regulations and agreements slowly but steadily restored both order and, importantly, economic growth. </p>
<p>By 2025, people seemed to be growing weary of so much top-down control and letting leaders and authorities make choices for them.  Wherever national interests clashed with individual interests, there was conflict. Sporadic pushback became increasingly organized and coordinated, as disaffected youth and people who had seen their status and opportunities slip away — largely in developing countries — incited civil unrest. In 2026, protestors in Nigeria brought down the government, fed up with the entrenched cronyism and corruption. Even those who liked the greater stability and predictability of this world began to grow uncomfortable and constrained by so many tight rules and by the strictness of national boundaries. The feeling lingered that sooner or later, something would inevitably upset the neat order that the world’s governments had worked so hard to establish.</p></p>

        <p>More interesting information:The World Bank’s COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Program documents, marked “For Official Use Only,” identify the Bank’s COVID-19 program as ending in March 2025, more than four years away from our current date (read page 1 of 60). The program’s start date was April 2020.

        <p>They're following this like an instruction manual. We're currently at the biometric ID stage, because 15 countries have currently signed up for such a thing, and it's outlined in an EU document from years ago that a vaccination passport should be introduced.</p>

        <p>Read the report... Page 18 to 25, it's the exact steps and procedures that have been happening in 2020.</p>
<p>In their " prediction ", everything starts in 2010... Hoax started exactly a decade later, so use according timelines. It seems to indicate according to their theory, massive pushback against government tyranny will happen but decades later after the lockdown tyranny started. In reality, pushback started within months and in a year or two, bureaucrats pushing this will be voted out, so their estimations on the agenda's pushback was fairly flawed.</p>

        <p>As a result, his list of trade accomplishments keeps growing. NAFTA is gone, replaced by a far stronger United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. China and its enablers on the global stage are at last being held accountable. Trade agreements with South Korea, Japan, and others have been renegotiated to protect American jobs and customers.
“Globalization has made the financial elites who donate to politicians very wealthy, but it’s left millions and millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache—and our towns and cities with empty factories and plants,” President Trump said.</p>
<p>“We’re fighting for Main Street, not Wall Street. We have rejected globalism and embraced patriotism.”</p>
