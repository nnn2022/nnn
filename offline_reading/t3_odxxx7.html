    <strong>Frequently mocked and judged online for my anti lockdown views</strong>
    <p><p>Hello r/NoNewNormal</p>
<p>I have received frequent hostility ,judgement and even been subject mocking for my lockdown scepticism views and criticism  of lockdowns measures. It is becoming too much and I am close to deleting my reddit account because I can't enjoy reddit anymore.Â  </p>
<p>When people outside of r/lockdownskepticism or r/NoNewNormal  see my threads they judge my character because of this. It really does upset me because I feel like I am being judged for this one thing. I am more than just my lockdown scepticism and I have other interests too . I am not a bad person but I am being treated like one it does upset me so much. It really does.</p>
<p>I have been told to seek mental health help for my views by many thread users on other reddit subs,  I have had the threads I regularly write here mocked by outside users of r/lockdownskepticism or r/NoNewNormal . Rescently in a deleted thread on a sub I asked about visiting a Scotland and the some or the Scottish users said I am not welcome there because of my views. The users criticised me for being so open about my views on this topic on a public forum and how I shouldn't complain about being criticised. </p>
<p>I use reddit because I like the freedom I have to express my real views under the veil of anonymity. I can't share my real views to my family and friends. If I have not got the safety of the Internet then I haven't got anywhere to go and already I am lonely.</p>
<p>I can't take it anymore </p>
<p>I need some tips how do you deal with frequent mocking and hostility online for being a lockdown sceptic or critical of the new normal? Please help as I am this close to deleting my account meaning all my well thought out articles criticising lockdowns</p></p>

        <p>Robsell0 Sorry I didnt make my self clear. When I use other reddit subs to talk about different things people have gone through my post history and found my threads on r/lockdownskepticism.  I have been judged as person for my views opposing lockdowns. I have been told to stay away from r/lockdownskepticism , I have a been labelled having an "insufferable personality ' for being a lockdown sceptic and somebody even accused me of belonging to cult because of my membership of this sub.</p>
<p>I can't enjoy reddit anymore because people judge me the minute they see my post history.</p>

        <p>Wastefulrprain Thanks the worst ones are the ones who bring up my r/lockdownskepticism threads on subs that discuss other things. It's form of public humiliation and shaming. It's upsets me so much because in my threads I am my real self . I turned to writing because I was worried about what the world and humanity has  evolved in to during the lockdown. My family and friends couldn't see what I saw . </p>
<p>When I write I am my pure sensitive altruistic self this is a side of myself I don't show in the real world. In the real world I keep my real feelings from people because I am afraid of getting hurt,  I misunderstood and throughout most if my life I struggled to fit in. </p>
<p>You are right they are creeps the people who do this.</p>

<p>I can't enjoy reddit anymore because people judge me the minute they see my post history. I am told a couple of hours ago by someone on r/ Scotland the following " I was going to give you tips about visiting Scotland but nah we don't want you here " this person said this after they saw my post history.</p>

        <p>Do not ever seek approval from online forums.  It's all irrelevant.  You chose to not take the vaccine.  Your choice.  Most people who've had it were pressured into the vaccine and some of them regret it.  You can not untake the vaccine.  You have chosen the sane path.  That's all you need to know.</p>

        <p>I use online forums mainly  to express my real concerns about what has happened to the world in the pandemic without judgement and I was expecting to feel some degree of common ground in finding people worldwide who feel the same. In  the real world I am lonely ie family who don't understand me at all,  friends super successful with their lives and just haven't got anyone really so I created an online personality. If I am not safe here on reddit then I am not safe anywhere . Already the stress and extreme anxiety about another lockdown coming is damaging me but I am being mocked for my genuine concerns.</p>

        <p>There's not much worse than having something to say and no way or nowhere to say it, but you do have this subreddit, and if you're really desperate, you can always shoot me a message. Or not. I don't give a shit what you do, whatever. You can sell all your earthly possessions and join a fucking UFO cult for all I care.</p>
<p>Thing is, if your stress and extreme anxiety are caught up in finding catharsis on Reddit, you might as well douse yourself with fish chum and go swimming with the sharks. A lot of people on this site are raging psycho and are in fact borderline genocidal (lacking only opportunity and balls). It's nothing personal against you in particular; they hate EVERYONE who isn't them.</p>

<p>The worst thing these are the same people who like to preach about mental health awareness so many people on social media like to preach about mental health but turn out to be such horrible people. I have noticed people who preach mental health the most are the biggest buillies ever and the worst individuals .</p>
<p>Being told I need to seek help for my mental health because of my views is really hurtful because no therapist or anti depressants will take away away how worried i am about another lockdown. I am being labelled as crazy when I am genuinely worried about the world around me. I hate being in lockdown because I have not got a real meaningful purpose. All I wanted in lockdown was a purpose and the absence of the purpose was killing me.</p>

<p>Maybe take a break, maybe this is god or your gut, whatever telling you to take some "me" time. </p>
<p>Or distance your self from subreddits that rarely talk about "triggering" topics?</p>

<p>Journal of Epidemiology:<br>
âEpidemic theory dictates that a reduction in the force of infection by a pathogen is associated with an increase in the average age at which individuals are exposed. For those pathogens that cause more severe disease among hosts of an older age, interventions that limit transmission can paradoxically increase the burden of disease in a population.â<br>
âThe link between limiting pathogen exposure and improving public health is not always so straightforward. Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically increase the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.â<br>

âAmong 9,157,814 adults â¤65 years, living with children 0-11 years was not associated with increased risks of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospital or ICU admission but was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 death (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62-0.92). Living with children aged 12-18 years was associated with a small increased risk of recorded SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13), but not associated with other COVID-19 outcomes. Living with children of any age was also associated with lower risk of dying from non-COVID-19 causes. Among 2,567,671 adults &rt;65 years there was no association between living with children and outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2. We observed no consistent changes in risk following school closure.â<br>

âA Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on COVID-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that infections were in decline before full UK lockdownâ<br>
https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02090<br>
Journal of Behavioural Economics for Policy:<br>
âThe response to COVID-19 has been overwhelmingly to lockdown much the worldâs economies in order to minimize death rates as well as the immediate negative effects of COVID-19. I argue that such policy is too often de-contextualized as it ignores policy externalities, assumes death rate calculations are appropriately accurate and, and as well, assumes focusing on direct Covid-19 effects to maximize human welfare is appropriate. As a result of this approach current policy can be misdirected and with highly negative effects on human welfare. Moreover, such policies can inadvertently result in not minimizing death rates (incorporating externalities) at all, especially in the long run.â<br>

Frontiers in Public Health Journal:<br>
âHigher Covid death rates are observed in the [25/65Â°] latitude and in the [â35/â125Â°] longitude ranges. The national criteria most associated with death rate are life expectancy and its slowdown, public health context (metabolic and non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden vs. infectious diseases prevalence), economy (growth national product, financial support), and environment (temperature, ultra-violet index). Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did not appear to be linked with death rate. Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population resilience through better physical fitness and immunity.â<br>

âOur objective was to assess the association between staying at home (%) and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions in the worldâ¦. After preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3741 pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were significant. With our results, we were not able to explain if COVID-19 mortality is reduced by staying at home inâ\~â98% of the comparisons after epidemiological weeks 9 to 34â¦. We were not able to explain the variation of deaths/million in different regions in the world by social isolation, herein analyzed as differences in staying at home, compared to baseline.â<br>

âImplementing any NPIs was associated with significant reductions in case growth in 9 out of 10 study countries, including South Korea and Sweden that implemented only lrNPIs [lr = less restrictive] (Spain had a nonâsignificant effect). After subtracting the epidemic and lrNPI effects, we find no clear, significant beneficial effect of mrNPIs [mr = more restrictive] on case growth in any country.â<br>

American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene:<br>
âPolicies regarding workplace closing, restrictions on gatherings, closing public transport, stay-at-home requirements, internal movement restrictions, public information campaigns, testing, and contact tracing were not significant predictors of mortality. Likewise, overall indices of stringency and government response were not associated with mortality.â<br>

âLockdowns do not reduce Covid-19 deaths. This pattern is visible on each date that key lockdown decisions were made in New Zealand. The apparent ineffectiveness of lockdowns suggests that New Zealand suffered large economic costs for little benefit in terms of lives saved.â<br>

âIn a recent article, Flaxman et al. allege that non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by 11 European countries saved millions of lives. We show that their methods involve circular reasoning. The purported effects are pure artefacts, which contradict the data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the United Kingdomâs lockdown was both superfluous and ineffectiveâ<br>

University of Greenwich Preprint:<br>
âBiomedical evidence from the early months of the pandemic suggests that lockdowns were associated with a reduced viral reproductive rate, but that less restrictive measures also had a similar effect. Lockdowns are associated with reduced mortality in epidemiological modelling studies but not in studies based on empirical data from the Covid-19 pandemic. Psychological research supports the proposition that lengthy lockdowns may exacerbate stressors such as social isolation and unemployment that have been shown to be strong predictors of falling ill if exposed to a respiratory virus. Studies at the economic level of analysis points to the possibility that deaths associated with economic harms or underfunding of other health issues may outweigh the deaths that lockdowns save, and that the extremely high financial cost of lockdowns may have negative implications for overall population health in terms of diminished resources for treating other conditions.â<br>
