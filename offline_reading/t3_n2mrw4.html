    <strong>We should compile a list of ways people have died/suffered from the new normal.</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of these cases are real but they can also be hypothetical because these assholes are counting people dying from underlying conditions as covid.  So why can't we make guesses(which are most likely fact) of way people died from the new normal.  </p>
<p>Deaths:
- Overdoses/suicides from lockdown depression fucking obvious  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>person on cruise ship commits suicide from being trapped on it too long    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woman scared to go to dentist finds out she has oral cancer after finally going after a year.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dumb shit trying to main social distance walks in road and gets hit by car  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>person has operation delayed since lockdown and dies  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>too many people put off operations and now feel safe that vaccines are out so create a long list to get life safing procedures all at once.  People at the end of the list dies.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tensions boil from stress excess murder  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>child and domestic abuse murder from being trapped at home  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biden makes travel too difficult for people to visit countries dependant on tourism.  Which causes waitresses to lose their jobs and be forced in prostituion.  Crime to rise and murders and hunger to happen.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is is so fucking obvious.  More people are dying long term from this then covid would kill.  Murders are up all over the place and young healthy people are dying from new normal.</p></p>
