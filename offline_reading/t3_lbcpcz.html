    <strong>Nightly Doomer Fucktard Story. February 2nd Edition. Gather around for story-time kids.</strong>
    <p><p>So I‚Äôm gonna try doing one of these every few days. Trust me, I have enough content to make this a regular thing.</p>
<p>Early last year I picked up a consulting contract at a company I used to work at. Most the employees I worked with a couple of years prior had moved on, but a few still remained.</p>
<p>Jackie was one that remained. 29 years old, not ugly and could have maybe been hot if she wasn‚Äôt such a complete slob. We‚Äôd catch up here and there when I would leave work and she was smoking her 15th cig of the day in the parking lot. Anyways the pandemic hits and one of our WebEx meetings run long and we keep talking, and she tells me her life is a mess because she got popped for an aggravated DUI last holiday season and all the fun stuff that comes with that.</p>
<p>Anyways a few weeks later I realize the scamdemic will be lasting for more than two months, I book a trip to go work remotely down south. I had to go to the office to pickup a hotspot and a wire I needed, and on my way out I see Jackie‚Äôs having a smoke in her car, door open and all. She asks me what I was picking up and I tell her. She goes absolutely ballistic upon hearing that I dared take a flight and travel with wanton disregard for everyones health during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Next came the granny story. Whining about how people like me were making this last longer and she couldn‚Äôt even visit gammy. Aww.</p>
<p>I engaged in a brief debate, but I just finished the convo by saying it was disingenuous for her to play the ‚Äúcommon-good‚Äù card when she‚Äôs fresh off an aggravated DUI and she has to blow into a fucking kazoo just to get her car started since she‚Äôs such a danger to herself and others.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jackie and I haven‚Äôt spoken since. I wonder if she‚Äôll have a stroke next week when she sees that I‚Äôve circumvented Canadian travel restrictions to spend some time in Florida and other tropical areas.</p>
<p>Tldr; Boomer bitch that I sometimes talked to at work went full Karen on me about being selfish for traveling during a pandemic. Meanwhile the chain-smoking bitch is 30k down in lawyer fees trying to get off an aggravated DUI... but I‚Äôm the selfish one. Doomer logic/10</p></p>

        <p>Damn! As she's smoking, talking about her DUI she's angry because you are taking a flight??? Hypocritical! Wtf is up with these ppl.? And you'd think she would be more likely to be anti mask too.</p>

        <p>Back then masks weren‚Äôt mandatory so I‚Äôm not sure what her deal on masks is. But she was definitely fearing that I would bring the Covid-Aids back from Florida and it would hunt down her granny that she let wallow in her own piss for years at a seniors residence...</p>

        <p>I don't know how to crunch the numbers, but I would guess that drunk driving is statistically more likely to kill someone than you going on a trip and catching covid.</p>

        <p>Bruh she's sounds gross. If I had a choice between having her as a coworker and getting sick with covid I'd rather let Mike Tyson punch me in the face because I'm asymptomatic.</p>

        <p>Give her a break, she is obviously struggling and the pandemic situation clearly isn't helping with her mental state.  Generally in this type of situation it pays to be nice and keep yourself outside the blast radius.  Particularly where your work is concerned.</p>

        <p>You can still fly to the Caribbean, but you need to connect in Florida.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be there long enough that I probably won‚Äôt have to do the 3 day jail when I get back, but even if I do I won‚Äôt really care. It‚Äôs worth it to get away from the idiots that run this country.</p>
