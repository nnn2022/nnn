        <p>It's so incredibly obvious to us.  </p>
<p>What I'm not sure about is if they can't see it?  Or is it they are too stubborn to understand they've been lied to this entire time?</p>
<p>As this year goes on I'm starting to think they realize they've been wrong the entire time, but they just can't admit it.  Their only option, is to plow on full speed ahead.</p>

        <p>That makes so much sense that it hurts! </p>
<p>I think you’re right, it’s stubbornness. Even in those who appear to be full-in on the “health and safety precautions”, I don’t hear the same sincerity in their voices they had early on, it’s like they’re just going through the motions now.</p>

        <p>I was under the impression they were using them before, as many (“on our side”) had made claims about how they were making up covid as the cause of death without use of an autopsy or even having a “legitimate” covid test. I was under the impression that if someone died with any flu-like symptoms it was gonna be recorded as a covid death.</p>
<p>Now, they’re literally changing old death certificates to fit their narrative.</p>
<p>&rt;Matching front-line surveillance data with death certificates can improve data in both systems, and can sometimes lead to rewritten certificates, Mr. Anderson said. But changing death certificates isn’t easy, he said. The person who filled out the death certificate—often a doctor—has to agree to amend the record.</p>

        <p>Growing up, I used to watch Felix the Cat. Felix had a magical bag from which he would pull out anything that the script needed at specific times. The C19 saga is one giant magical back from which the eXpErTs (Felix the Cat) can pull anything they want to ensure that people are continuing to live in absolute fear and that the 'new abnormal' continues without any hiccups.</p>

        <p>Ahh Felix, it’s been a long time since I’ve heard that name.</p>
<p>And yes, I’m surprised at how many people, some of whom are otherwise very intelligent people, are still eating this shit up and going along for the ride. </p>
<p>My opinion/theory is it is fear that drives their almost cult-like devotion to the Church of Covid. Fear to question the system, especially if that system has been good to them. It’s hard to grow up brainwashed and then to be forced to see one day that the cult elders you’ve been following (I.e, the government) are cult leaders and they’re trying to get you to drink the “magic” Kool-aid.</p>

<p>This is basic human biology: when humans are in fear, the part of the brain responsible for critical thinking and analysing &amp; solving problems shuts down as the primal limbic system takes over. It's next-to-impossible to have an intellectual debate with people in fear: their limbic system can't support such higher order functions.  </p>

<p>I was an ecoterrorist in my teens until one doomsday prognostication failed to come to pass. Suffice it to say, I don't believe in many things these days, particularly things designed to cause fear and panic in people. The Jonestown massacre is currently being reproduced on a planet-wide scale.</p>

<p>All this talk of the guidestones and population control, and here we have people volunteering to take this “vaccine” that have a lot of people (even the followers) questioning its safety. </p>
<p>Then you have the people who don’t even care if it’s safe, they just want to “go back to normal” no matter the costs.</p>

        <p>I am glad that I will be back home where I have tonnes of guns during the summer. I won't be in Europe when the vaxxed guinea pigs start getting sick and dying in large numbers during the autumn and winter. People have been warned that these vaccines are dangerous and there's been an 18-year precedent set. When the real deaths happen, they'll FORCE vaccinations on all people, and at that time, I will be forced to defend my family from medical tyranny.</p>

<p>It’s kind of an internet joke term that started a couple years ago in reference to the idea of a civil war/revolution against the government here in the US.</p>
<p>The media here in the US tries to spin it as a “race war” when it comes up, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. The media only says that because it’s an easy way to sway public opinion of the movement.</p>

<p>Sorry, it's getting late here so my brain cells weren't firing well (must be the aluminium). Like Helter Skelter. Thanks for the explanation. Yeah, I have been accused of being a Nazi white supremacist (despite being African) because I won't get sucked into race wars and intersectionality race-baiting. There are racists but not every person is one.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the internet right now is pretty much led by SJWs and young teenagers and they like to pick fights with people.</p>
<p>And lol, until you said you lived in Africa I made the assumption you were American because you said you have lots of guns and your English is good. I’m surprised because a lot of places outside the US I thought were pretty strict (and even some places in the US, some folks might be surprised by that). Where I live, there aren’t a lot of people who like, let alone have any guns.</p>

        <p>Lived (past tense). I have legal guns because I hunt. Nothing prevents a person from owning a gun in my country. I gather that you're in a deep blue state? My condolences. ;)</p>

        <p>I knew this would happen.  Are these even covid deaths or are they "probable covid deaths" without positive test that just look like they might have been covid?  We have no idea.</p>

        <p>Pretty much exactly that. There’s literally no way to tell and they’re doing the same thing we’ve already been accusing them of: “lumping in anything even remotely similar to covid”</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was just the death certificates, and that some weren’t properly logged into their system. Then I read more of the article (I stopped after a couple paragraphs because let’s be real, it’s hot garbage), and I found THIS gem...</p>
<p>&rt; Matching front-line surveillance data with death certificates can improve data in both systems, and can sometimes lead to rewritten certificates, Mr. Anderson said. But changing death certificates isn’t easy, he said. The person who filled out the death certificate—often a doctor—has to agree to amend the record.</p>
<p>They’re literally changing death certificates, a method of measurement that was already largely problematic due to how the cause can be made up on the spot, as it was done with covid so many times this last year. Now they’re going back and altering OLD death certificates from early 2020 that didn’t help their stats enough...</p>

        <p>Ug.  Yes that is exactly what I imagined.</p>
<p>"Hey we looked a little closer at all the data from Denver in April and it turns out we found 1000 extra deaths that were probably from covid so let's add those."</p>
<p>No idea how they are doing the data revisions, but if it was me I would find people who had died without families and you could say they were eaten by werewolves and there would be nobody to object.</p>

        <p>If you have diarrhea, it’s probably because you’ve been eaten by a werewolf.</p>
<p>Just ignore the fact that you eat like a giant baby with money, it’s definitely the werewolf thing.</p>

        <p>At this point let’s just say everyone who died last year died of Covid and be done with it. It STILL doesn’t justify locking a whole country down and keeping kids out of school.</p>
