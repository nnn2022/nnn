    <strong>This is Why Society Worships "COVID"</strong>
    <p><p>Literally all corporations and even regular folks who still have jobs are benefitting from this imaginary disease, and that explains why they want the illusion to stay forever. </p>
<p>How are they benefitting? Let's take a look at only a few examples:</p>
<p>Customer service departments have cut staff by ~90%. Instead of having 200 people answer customers' calls, let's only have 20 on the payroll and have the customer spend an hour on hold... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more free breakfast or daily housekeeping at most hotels... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Returns no longer accepted at most shops... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more free food samples at grocery stores... You can still pay for that 1 slice of ham if you want to try it at the deli, but no more free sample... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more pool access or very limited hours, but still pay full HOA dues... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Extremely limited availability of loaner vehicles at the dealership... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more indoor dining at McDonald's in order to cut staff cleaning and maintaining it. Let the pesants spend 15 minutes in drive-thru for "fast-food" instead... Oh, you want free refill? FUCK YOU...! <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Teachers prefer to so sit on their fat asses at home all day watching Netflix and spend an hour or two on a zoom call instead of actually working, while getting paid the full salary... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>Karen Schmoe doesn't feel like working for a week or two, but she can't get approval from her boss? Well, she thinks she has a fever now, so her time off is automatically approved... <em>Well, you know, because COVID...</em> </p>
<p>No more medical malpractice. Your relatively healthy father died under a minor surgery due to excessive bleeding as a result of the incompetent doctor? Well, you guessed it... He tested positive, so... <em>you know, COVID...</em></p></p>

        <p>This indicates that our society had some deep problems before all this shit got started. I agree. </p>
<p>The source of the problem is a feeling of apathy and hopelessness, especially among the young. I believe the reason for this is mostly central planning of the economy and vast government overreach at every level. </p>
<p>Real solutions will never get accepted by the entrenched elite, and the majority is led astray by propaganda. </p>
<p>It’s hard to see a way forward that doesn’t involve mass political upheaval at some point, and possibly the dissolution of the two major western political unions (United States and European Union)</p>

        <p>Exactly. The ones who are claiming all this inequality and systemic racism are in fact the very ones creating this education and wealth disparity every seen. We’ve seen the greatest transfer of wealth arguably ever and these privileged jackholes are the cause of it.</p>

        <p>All these business have reduced service and raised prices because "Covid" I am just waiting for the airlines to get onboard. How long until we have a "Covid surcharge" on airfares. We are still paying for luggage from 2001  and "fuel surcharges" from 2008. Pretty sure we are do for some pandemic surcharges any day now.</p>

        <p>Good points, to go along with OP’s spot on comments.</p>
<p>Change has come.  It won’t revert back easily, if at all.  There will be some businesses/ functions that will require proof of vaccination.  And it will seem, at first, an insurmountable block to your way of life.  Simple answer, is avoid those businesses or functions that require this.  Again, that’s simple: if you have to have an international flight, there is no way around it.  Your employment might depend on it.  In that case, stand your ground.  Have the courage to walk away, and make them understand why.</p>
<p>When we were 5, and entering grade school, we had no choice but to have certain vaccinations before we could enter.  Now, I’m no anti-vaxxer.  But, I AM an adult.  And I’m required to pay taxes.  I’m required to carry a permit to own a pistol.  I comply.  But I do NOT have to comply to accept a barely tested vaccination, for a disease with low probability of serious illness.  </p>
<p>Stand your ground.  Because of, you know, <em>covid</em>.</p>

        <p>I’m gonna guess... could it be the letters C, O, V, I, and D? Maybe space for a - and a 19 to make it seem more deadly? Notice how nobody calls it “coronavirus” anymore because Covid-19 sounds more mystical and destructive.</p>

        <p>This reminds me of when my town's boat launches were closed during the first wave because of COVID, even when they were open in a nearby town. The rationale was that they didn't want people getting into boating accidents and crowding up the not-so-crowded hospital, and that they didn't want people from outside of town coming and using the boat launch and going to our stores. Pretty lame excuses. I think they were just too lazy to put the docks in, TBH. Eventually, it was open, but they made it difficult to get a season's pass.</p>

<p>It is imaginary. Ask yourself if you friends got sick for weeks before covid would it have been a surprise? Usually morbidly obese people are the ones who get hit by the flu hardest not a new fact. How does a respiratory disease cause someone to lose hearing in a ear? I am pretty sure you're a troll.</p>

        <p>My friend who lost her hearing in one of her ears is in her forties, is not overweight, and has never had a health issue that I know about. Re the hearing thing, it’s a rare but well-documented side effect as the otolaryngological system can also be damaged as a result of viral infection. My other friend who had it also doesn’t have any health issues and had flu-like symptoms for a week and half and still cannot taste. There is absolutely no reason my friends would lie to me, so unless you’re insinuating that they themselves are delusional, along with millions of others who have had it, then I guess you’re beyond the reach of logic. The reason no one takes people on this sub seriously outside this bubble is that y’all are incapable of thinking critically and seeing shades of grey. A pandemic can simultaneously be real and can also be used as a tool to make the rich richer.</p>

        <p>Source of covid causing hearing loss never heard of it happening.  Just because I questioned you does not make me illogical. And there is no reason why I would lie to you or you too me. Oh so you're a doomer? Considering covid has not been isolated or proven to exist and the pcr tests are blatantly bogus it is not a stretch to think that it may not exist. Or the pandemic could be completely made up and used as a tool of oppression.</p>

        <p>They said it was a made up disease, so an apt comparison to what your comment is saying is if you were implying that people don't die from car accidents at all, and someone else saying they know someone who wrapped around a tree and died last week</p>

        <p>I love how you get downvoted for one of your coworkers dying, because these far right conspiracy extremists can’t believe in something when it’s staring them in the face.</p>
<p>When i first found this subreddit i thought people were joking, beginning to get more worried about the people behind the screens, who think that hundreds of thousands of deaths are ‘hoaxes’</p>
<p>Kinda reminds me of the Jubilee episode where the pshycics (idk how to spell it) try to guess the fake psychic and fail. These people remind me of them.</p>
<p>Wonder how many of them voted Trump this election...</p>

There's not really much counterargument to my healthy 50 year old coworker dying of covid, so they just silently downvote because it doesn't match their beliefs and move on.</p>

        <p>It’s not that I don’t hear that your coworker died, it’s just that even if some people are dying, as some do every year, the masks and lockdowns are being proven beyond reasonable doubt to have little to no effect. We’re still waiting for that super bowl celebration spike.. still waiting. When you consider the transfer of wealth out of the middle class, people whose lives are decimated by the lockdown, # of people that are going to starve on the planet due to the aftermath of the lockdowns... many on this sub feel the balance tips in favor of no lockdowns, no mask requirement. A lot of us complied for the first several months. If one person started this, how did anyone ever think it’s going back in the bag?. There will need to come a point where everyone is responsible for their own safety. If you’re scared, you have options. Wear a mask, wear 3, get a faceshield, don’t leave your home without a bubble suit, or live your life in a padded room.</p>
