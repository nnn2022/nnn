    <strong>Can the COVID Gene Therapies cause Antibody-Dependent Enhancement? A Scientific Analysis</strong>
    <p><p>ADE, Antibody-Dependent Enhancement occurs when the antibodies generated during an immune response recognize and bind to a pathogen, but they are unable to prevent infection. Instead, these antibodies act as a “Trojan horse,” allowing the pathogen to get into cells and exacerbate the immune response.</p>
<p>Like the 1960's RSV and measles vaccines, and the 2016 Dengue virus vaccine,  <strong>the COVID mRNA gene therapies cause ADE.</strong></p>

        <p>I think the only sensible COVID vaccine would have consisted of a live replication deficient virus, administered intranasally. This would lead to protection in the first layer of your immune system, the mucous membranes. The upper respiratory tract is immunologically separate from the rest of the body, so if you want to prevent transmission, you need to focus on the upper respiratory tract. Such a vaccine would also mean a much broader response to the virus. Some scientists are developing such a vaccine.</p>
<p>In a natural infection, we see that the body also generates an important response against the nucleocapsid protein. In the Western vaccines, the nucleocapsid protein is not included, your body just produces a bunch of spike proteins in your bloodstream. Besides the live vaccines being developed, other groups are developing oral inactivated vaccines, that contain the spike protein, the nucleocapsid protein and other proteins. Again, you would be left with a broader immune response and without the risks associated with having your own capillary blood vessels expressing the toxic spike protein.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, in the whole Western world we received a "vaccine" (that's how it was sold to us), that consists simply of a mechanism to make our own capillary blood vessels express an old version of this toxic spike protein in large amounts, a version of the spike protein from before the virus mutated.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense to me. China doesn't go for this method of vaccinating their population. The vaccines that China gives to its third world allies don't use this method either. For whatever reason, these Western pharmaceutical companies started working on this vaccine as soon as the DNA sequence of this virus was published. Why did they immediately settle on this method, if studies showed that it generally causes antibody-dependent enhancement when you immunize animals against the spike protein?</p>
<p>I don't have an explanation. None of this makes sense to me. I hope there's a benign explanation, but it genuinely worries me.</p>

        <p>We all know that this aspect of it is very much present and observable.</p>
<p>False hope leads nowhere. We should hope to mitigate the damage.</p>

        <p>I am praying everyday that people come to their senses and stop "vaccinating." I hope I'm doing my part by posting these scientific analyses on how the covid gene therapies are failures (or successes if they meant to cull us)</p>

        <p>In the end, there is only so much we can do. If people want to die because the government told them to, we cannot force them to live.</p>
<p>If people want to "save the planet" by surrendering everything to the powers that have exploited every resource available to them, it is a tragedy.</p>
<p>However, the will to learn the truth and change must come from inside. Naturally, it is impossible to settle this whole thing without a Nuremberg II for the criminals who have committed atrocities. However, there is no point in using up your energy over every single victim that was blinded or willingly underwent this experiment. The children and the weak should have been protected from this.</p>
<p>I feel deeply for those vulnerable groups. The best we can hope now is that the culture underneath it all will change and live that change in our own local communities.</p>

        <p>I dont know much about biology but i think it is something like insulin shots if you rely too much on it because your body is losing its ability to create insulin, you will lose that ability even more once you are relying too much on the shots.</p>
<p>Same as vaccines, if your body received the instruction to produce antibodies customized for certain variants, it might become dumb enough they cant create antibodies for certain other variants that is partially similar to the ones the instructions are designed for. Thus the body keeps making the antibodies they were instructed for but doesnt work on the variants and now the virus takesover the host.</p>
<p>But of course my thoughts has been debunked by many experts on other subs.</p>
