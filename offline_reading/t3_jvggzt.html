    <strong>Enough is enough.</strong>
    <p><p>Enough is enough. I can no longer stand by idly in the face of so much ignorance.</p>
<p>There is a public health crisis that affects 40% of adults - and growing - in the United States today and NO ONE is talking about it. The public health dialog has been hijacked by unrelated discussions with far less statistical impact.</p>
<p>This is a disease that can lead to death. There is nothing worse. Even if you don’t die from it, you can experience severe, long-term health conditions that require on-going treatment and result in lower quality of life. Transporting and caring for these patients can also lead to physical injuries and sometimes physical disability for our healthcare heroes. It’s also making people more vulnerable to Covid-19. Why is no one talking about obesity?</p>
<p>It’s disgusting that people have the right to engage in pro-obesity activities. It doesn’t just affect you! Don’t you know that obesity is a communicable disease?! Here is a cherry-picked study that examines how obesity spreads using a simulated model [<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa066082">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa066082</a>] that should definitely be used to guide public policy in real life.</p>
<p>This study was actually too much work to try to understand so I will draw conclusions from and instead cite this TIME article [<a href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1646997,00.html">http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1646997,00.html</a>] from almost 15 years ago that I still didn’t read. I challenge you to refute my claims with ACTUAL scientific studies. I will respond to any attempts at reasonable discussion with ad-hominem attacks.</p>
<p>Obesity also disproportionately affects non-Hispanic blacks (49.6%) and Hispanics (44.8%) [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm</a>]. Without any further research or nuanced discussion of the issue, I can only conclude that anyone who does not support the strictest anti-obesity policy is racist (and also ugly).</p>
<p>I am tired of uncaring, ignorant people claiming that their personal freedoms should supersede the public good. How can anyone be such a SOCIOPATH as to want to enjoy some of the activities that make life worth living like enjoying food that cannot be replicated at home, enjoying the company of friends and family, and existing in any space outside of home or work in any capacity (physically, emotionally, and/or mentally). This is truly the only thing that matters and no other factors should be under consideration. These policies should continue indefinitely until they actually affect me or become politically unpopular.</p>
<p>We should cancel all end-of-year holidays henceforth since they are super spreader events for seasonal weight gain. Also, I am insufferable and blame all family discord on others and will take no responsibility to try and make the few days we see each other a year happy and meaningful. Despite this, when my estranged elderly family members end up in long-term elderly care (and I won’t visit- gross), I will fight tooth and nail to prolong their painful, lonely existence at any cost. People should never die and there is nothing worse than death.</p>
<p>Modest Proposals for Anti-Obesity Policy:</p>
<p>- Permanent shutdown of all businesses, institutions, and ideas that can contribute to pro-obesity in any way (restaurants, grocery stores, agriculture, the internet, electricity, carboxyl groups, energy as a quantitative property of physics, etc.)</p>
<p>- Weight checks before entrance to businesses. People who don’t meet BMI guidelines for non-obese should be denied entry until they quarantine for 14 days and pass accepted BMI. Any businesses not following regulations will be shamed on NextDoor.</p>
<p>- Blanket adoption of all public policy from countries with the lowest obesity rates since there are no cultural, geographic, or government differences between countries at all and no unintended effects that could result from these policies.</p>

        <p>It's fascinanting to hear that in the US there is something called fat-shaming. Coming from Italy, calling out the fact that you've become fat it's quite normal, and it's seen as a caring, healthy thing to do. It's hard to explain. But yes when my self I also got a little overweight all friends and family would point that out, but not in a shaming way. Obesity is seen as a unhealthy thing in Italy, has nothing to do with attractiveness, and if someone cares for you it will push you to get better and fit. No one ever got offended when someone else pointed that out. Of course, it's different from someone bullying you or trying to talk shit about you at your back. The un-attractiveness is also not related to the body shape in particular, but seen as a person who doesn't take care of themselves, love themselves, has a very sedentary uncaring way of life towards themselves. Italy is the European country with less obesity related problems, along with Greece and Spain (closest cultures in Europe). The Mediterranean diet is something that people do in the US when want to lose weight. I've been "shamed" (can't really say that is what it is anyway, because it's a heavy word), more like made fun of when buying a package of crisps in italy, countless times. But it's more like "why are you eating that shit bud it's so unhealthy and gross" and it would end up with me being "yeah, you're right". I think this way of bluntness typical of Italians has been very helpful for me and other people to keep our health in line. Now that people are becoming more snowflakes, they can't hear the truth that what they are eating is actually killing them, which can't be truer. It's not about body or fat shaming, being obese is extremely unhealthy and if the person near you truly cares about you will help you do something for it or at least try to make you a little aware.</p>

        <p>This is the healthy attitude to have. In the US and UK people are so over-sensitive to the plight of the less fortunate or disadvantaged that this somehow makes people believe that nothing is anyone's fault and it's always the fault of 'racism' or 'poverty' and sometimes there's some truth to this but whatever the real reason behind fatness, the best solution to the problem is for the fat person to take responsibility and control over their situation. This will not only make them physically healthier but psychologically stronger as well, as they overcome this hurdle with their own means. Sadly, the crazed hysterical virtue signalling culture in the US and the UK don't want them to do this, they want to keep them fat and pretend like it's someone else's fault and out of their control.</p>

        <p>Because somehow, in the US, educating about obesity has become synonymous with bullying and the media has slowly normalized an unhealthy condition under the guise of "self-love" so the sugar and fast food industries can keep up their sales. Shoveling 15 tacos down your throat twice a week because it is taco Tuesday or self-care Sunday is seen as normal or cool.</p>
