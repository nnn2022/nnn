    <strong>Stand up and say no</strong>
    <p><p>I walked up to the entrance of the grocery store with mask in hand. I put it back in my pocket. Today, I said <em>NO</em> to tyranny. I got it through my head very quickly that I was okay with possible confrontation. I am a pretty big muscular dude so I was not too worried about it. 
For the past year, I have been putting on my muzzle like a good little slave boy. As time went on and I figured out that masks and whatnot were all bullshit I started wearing it beneath my nose. Then I started not wearing it as I exited the store after check out. Today, I finally did not wear one at all. Among a sea of masked up people, I was one of few people who did not have theirs on. For the first time in so long I felt normal. I exchanged nods of approval with some who were afraid to take their muzzles off. To my surprise, nobody confronted me directly. In fact, some people looked at me and <em>took off their muzzles</em>. 
I only experienced 2 indirect confrontations (if you can even call them that)
The first, 2 college age girls. Purple hair, typical doomer look basically. They stop and stare at me, wanting me to notice. When I do, one of them says, “wow, I just want to say something”. In response I just stared at them, awaiting whatever they had to say. Evidently they were discouraged because they went on their way without saying shit. 
The second, 1 older man on the phone walking by me said obnoxiously, “I cannot believe the nerve of some people not wearing masks!”. I happened to be next to a couple of fellow no mask chads and we all laughed out loud in response. Pretty cool moment actually.</p>
<p>This is all bullshit guys. Free yourselves and take off the masks. They do nothing and serve no other purpose but to serve as a reminder that the sky is falling. Rise up and say <em>NO</em> to tyranny. </p>
<p>People need leaders now more than ever.</p></p>

        <p>Facts. One of our stores is fairly large (25000 sq ft)the other about half that size. Both stores have picked up so much extra business this past year from hearing about us not requiring masks. There’s a lot of good people out there who are afraid of speaking out. The silent majority is laying in wait</p>

        <p>Since people don't have a lot of cash nowadays, you should pay those fines in another currency, say... precious metals? How about lead? Also you don't want any trouble for late payment so why not send it as fast as possible? I heard there's special payment tools you can get which allow you to send your money single-handedly at 1,000 feet per second.</p>

        <p>Good or you! I'm fairly fit, muscular build, 5,8 160lbs  and had a big intimidating black guy (I'm also black) try to shame me and my wife at the beginning in April 2020. </p>
<p>He asked in a deep voice, "Excuse Me! Where's your masks?!"</p>
<p>I looked at him and asked "Who are you?" </p>
<p>That threw him off completely and he started stuttering, lol. </p>
<p>I saw no badge or company shirt, and even if I did I was aware of their company's policy and even though they advise people to wear mask they cannot force you to wear one or kick you out. He asked to speak with the manager after getting loud but when he came the manager told him what we already knew. </p>
<p>Big fat fail but I was definitely ready to go toe to toe if need be. I was tired of the mandate after the first couple of days and I wasn't putting on a muzzle for shit. A year later my family and I are still here, maskless and very much alive and well.</p>

        <p>Damn.  I’m reading this thread and thinking I’m just gonna do it and take the damn mask off.  I’ve been wearing it under my nose but I still feel like a pussy doing that and I hate that these bullies enforcing it have ANY hold/power on me.  The thing is in Vancouver Canada it’s damn mask-nazi central and I’ve already been confronted several times.  It looks like I really just have to grow a pair though and fucking do it.

        <p>I haven't worn a mask for a bit. Been to 4 smaller stores and finally did the same in target today. No one said a thing not did they avoid me like the plague. I'm a very tiny black girl and to the untrained eye I may look like a pushover, but that's far from the truth.</p>
<p>In general, I have no issue wearing masks as I would do it before covid times. It's just the principle of it all. You can't force people to do these things</p>

        <p>Welcome aboard!</p>
<p>I'm a big muscular guy too, no one says shit to me. (If they say shit <em>around</em> me, that doesn't count.) My girlfriend, who's knocking on the door of 5 feet tall, never wears a mask either. The other day we were in the supermarket when another woman, entering at the same time, put on a mask while saying, "I hate wearing these things." </p>
<p>My girlfriend said, "Then don't." </p>
<p>The other woman paused. </p>
<p>"Don't. Just don't put it on." </p>
<p>It literally never occurred to this woman that going barefaced was an option. But she entered the store without a mask. No idea if she kept it off or not, but whatever. People don't even realize how much autonomy they wield.</p>

<p>Yep this is huge. Negative emotions can keep us so stunted if we let them. Or rather, wanting to avoid negative emotions is what keeps us stunted.</p>
<p>You can literally do anything physically possible, if it weren't for various feelings you want to avoid.</p>

        <p>I've been maskless for a while. Admittedly, I don't go out much besides to a certain park, but still, I don't wear a mask. But I got a new doctor's appointment tomorrow. And even though I'm not going to bring or wear a mask, my nerves are a bit shaky.</p>

        <p>Save yourself a confrontation, wear a mask. It won't do you harm or come at a cost.</p>
<p>You are going to a Doctors office, it's not unreasonable to expect there to be people with conditions that can be severely affected by covid. Your presence without a mask will upset people, regardless of your <em>rights.</em></p>

        <p>I truly went to a jewelry store with 4 grand to buy a ring and the guy truly didn't want to let me in without a mask. I just laughed and told him that I had 4 grand to spend and ill take it somewhere else and walked away. I went to another store where they weren't on that bullshit. The next guy was happy to have my business and didn't harass me about a mask.</p>

If you're not an employee of the the establishment I'm in you have some options A) avoid me, B) get management to ask me to leave which I will do cheerfully or C) mind your own business.  Option D which would be direct confrontation will not go well for you.  I'll pretend to wear one when I'm on the clock maybe.</p>

        <p>Gives me hope I can muster up the strength to do the same as well. Me and the girlfriend are both at the putting it below your nose (sometimes I even pull it a bit further so my mouth is somewhat exposed) and take it off after checkout. The physical confrontation is the only thing that worries me. That and someone trying to video me and ruin my life like the countless others have done to other people. Bravo man</p>

        <p>I desperately want to see more people like you where I live. I just started going barefaced to the grocery stores myself, with a similar "i'm fucking done with this. I'm saying NO to tyranny" moment one day where I just took it off in the middle of the store one day and kept going. I'm a young mom with a toddler (who of course has never worn a mask nor will he ever) so perhaps I have a buffer from confrontation. No such exciting experience as yours - I am the only one without a mask and I have inspired nobody yet, but I have also not had anyone either directly or passive-aggressively confront me about it, thankfully. </p>
<p>I feel a great deal of anxiety about doing this, but it also feels so right. The feeling of being normal is addicting. To be a little brave in hopes I can inspire other people to defy this crap is a driving force for my defiance. Technically, my state's mandate actually says you should not do anything if you see someone not wearing a mask, nor can you question them about their medical history. I also figure that those unable to question authoritarian requirements are also unable to muster up the balls to confront me.</p>

        <p>Haven't done that yet, but they just mandated masks OUTSIDE here, again. I refuse to do that. I noticed the same thing, people walking past usually have their masks on their necks and put up their masks when walking past me, but now they all kind of touch their masks and kind of go to put it up but don't, and just keep them down.</p>

        <p>I like the sentiment and everything but this reads like a fantasy.</p>
<p>Its like one if those memes where someone does X (usually some form of white Knighting) and then everyone stands and applauds. </p>
<p>I personally can't support this sort of thing, whether it's true or false.</p>
<p>Walking around a shop staring at other people and being openly provocative, it's behaviour we shouldn't support.</p>
<p>I think most of what this sub has to offer is based on truth and reason, but we need to have the mindset and discipline to go with it. </p>
<p>Pro mask or anti mask, why support someone acting like a dick? It doesn't help our cause.</p>
<p>We should be calm controlled and mature, thoughts like ours are already seen as inflammatory, so why provide the extra ammunition.</p>
<p>Its reminds me of the weed people who think the best way towards legalisation is to be a cartoon character stoner and blaze up.</p>
<p>Be controlled, be mature, be the adults.</p>

        <p>Huh I’ve never considered this perspective. Thank you for this, but I am still going to wear a mask. I think it keeps the community safe from airborne pathogens such as influenza and COVID-19. </p>
<p>Im sorry if you’ve ever felt targeted or persecuted in your community for not supporting masking. It is hard to feel alone or in the minority.</p>

        <p>Really? On the CDC website it says that cloth masks can protect against large respiratory droplets like those released while talking, sneezing, or coughing. I suppose they could be of no significance then for small droplets, like casually breathing.</p>

        <p>Is this the same CDC that said masks not only did nothing but could actually have negative long term health effects? Then a couple months in did a complete 180 and said cloth masks are gods gift to humanity? Weird. I would not exactly call them a credible source if they can change up like that and expect us all to just accept it without question.</p>
<p>Edit: the typical response to this is “the science changed”. So before I even give you the chance to say it, there is absolutely no way several decades of data on masks and their effectiveness on a myriad of diseases miraculously changed. To say so would take some serious mental gymnastics.</p>

        <p>That’s a fair point and I see that you already have heard a common counter point. And so even with that caveat (that science changes in response to new information) I suppose your mind is already made up. I hope you stay safe and healthy.</p>
