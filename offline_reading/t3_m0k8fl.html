    <strong>My county repealed its mask mandate this morning!</strong>
    <p><p>I've mentioned my county's mask mandate a few times on this subreddit, and after about 3/4 of a year of it, things are finally starting to return to normal here!</p>
<p>In case you weren't aware, I live in Missouri, and how this state dealt with it is that instead of it being statewide, each county could have their own responses.  Don't know how many other states did something like this, but it led to varying degrees of normalcy throughout the state.</p>
<p>Finally glad to be free of this garbage, though it was a bit late compared to some other counties (like the county directly north of me).</p>
<p>And now, we wait until all of the businesses here open up to full capacity again...or at least the ones left.</p></p>

        <p>Congrats!  We really need to keep track of these, so when looking for places to visit and spend our money we can focus on areas with some interest in freedom.  And it should help put pressure on others to see counties and states with no ill effects from freedom.</p>

        <p>I fully expect to be downvoted, but I'm genuinely curious and I hope we can have a civil discussion about this - </p>
<p>Can you explain to me why wearing a 3 inch piece of cloth over part of your face in public for 1.25% of your life is such a huge deal?</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that the virus is contagious and can spread through droplets that fly out of your mouth, so can you please explain why you're so opposed to wearing a mask that would potentially stop those droplets from being shared by others?</p>

        <p>Do you think we should wear masks for the flu as well? Or stop driving cars to get rid of vehicle accident fatalities? Or should we ban fast food and mandate that people workout? Like I understand where you are coming from, but there has to be a line drawn somewhere, people die thats part of life.</p>

        <p>After being injured by a seatbelt in a bus collison... yes.</p>
<p>The seatbelt caused the one and only injury I had from that incident, so I don't consider them safe anymore. That said, seatbelts are not strapped to your face, and they're limited to vehicles. No one is asking me to wear a seatbelt to go shopping.</p>

        <p>I get your sentiment, but your accident that resulted in injury from a seatbelt that otherwise would not have occurred is not common. </p>
<p>As an EMT for 10+ years, it is my very strong anecdotal suggestion to wear your seatbelt. They will save your ass long before they cause undue injury.</p>
<p>Now, with that said; fuck masks.</p>

        <p>The problem with this line of thought is that others safety relies on you being able to stay in that drivers seat and able to at least attempt to control your vehicle. If you get tossed into the passenger seat and your vehicle then careens into pedestrians or another vehicle, then you now <em>have</em> caused injury to someone other than yourself.</p>

        <p>Disregard. I’ve got you mixed up with another commenter then. </p>
<p>The point I was trying to make is that you can be easily tossed from the drivers seat in a minor accident. If the car is still moving after you get tossed around (or god forbid ejected entirely from the vehicle), the car is now free to go wherever tf it wants because you’re no longer in the drivers seat in control of the vehicle. Which obviously can cause further problems.</p>

        <p>FWIW, I see no problems with asking a genuine question, and have no problem with giving you a genuine answer. The issue for me is that, despite what you may hear constantly, there is precisely zero evidence to support the idea that masks have any effect in slowing the spread of COVID (or any other aerosol-spread infection, for that matter), in fact that's not even what they're for.  </p>
<p>Surgical masks exist to stop bodily fluids such as blood from being sprayed into the surgeon's mouth during surgery, which would very obviously not be something you would want to happen. They are not designed to stop the spread of aerosols.</p>
<p>There has never been any evidence to support their effectiveness in slowing the spread of respiratory infections - see <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">this systematic review of studies</a> from Oxford University. Note that prior to COVID there was precisely one study done specifically on cloth masks, which found rates of infection amongst cloth mask wearers were three times higher than those wearing no mask at all. Also see <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">this Danish study</a>, a randomised control trial specifically looking at the effectiveness of cloth masks in slowing the spread of COVID.</p>
<p>So essentially, we have a piece of cloth that is nothing more than that. It offers no more health benefits than wearing an amulet. And yet wearing masks is mandated. Not recommended, mandated. This is a quite obvious breach of bodily autonomy. That might be OK if they did anything - you could argue that requiring motorcyclists to wear helmets breaches bodily autonomy, but the evidence in support of the safety benefits of motorcycle helmets is overwhelming, and thus the safety benefit outweighs the bodily autonomy argument. But there is zero evidence to support mask use, and yet it is still imposed on us. That's not OK.</p>
<p>Now there are other aspects of the COVID response I am more opposed to - lockdowns and stay-at-home orders breach multiple articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84092-1">similar lack of evidence</a> that they have any effect on the spread of COVID - but I do still oppose masks. Even though they are relatively harmless, they are still conditioning people to blindly follow orders, even when completely unsupported by scientific evidence, and to not question what they are told the evidence is.</p>
<p>I hope that addresses your question, and I am happy to answer any other questions you might have about opposition to the COVID response.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your response! I read through your reports, and I noticed a few alarming notes - "no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others."</p>
<p>The main point of wearing masks is to reduce transmission from yourself to others. It prevents droplets from leaving your mouth and entering other bodies, and this study explicitly states that it didn't test the effectiveness of transmission from mask-wearers to others.</p>
<p>On another note, since you seem like the kind of person I'd like to talk to (rational and willing to discuss, instead of screaming) - How you you reconcile the fact that most Asian countries' Covid cases and deaths are substantially lower than ours? </p>
<p>It's well-known that all Asian countries are <em>extremely</em> strict about mask usage, and it's also well-known that their Covid numbers are insanely good. For instance, Japan has roughly 37% of the USA's population, but they have 1.5% the amount of Covid deaths (8,253 in Japan compared to 538,315 in USA).</p>
<p>Japan's footprint is much smaller than the US, and their populations are much more condensed, so how do you explain the incredible disparity between our Covid results if not for strict mask usage?</p>

        <p>Why do you assume that Japan's good numbers are due to "strict mask usage"? There are countless places throughout the world that have strict mask usage as well, but don't have good numbers. There is absolutely ZERO correlation between mask usage and good covid numbers. For every place that has good numbers, there are 20 that have bad numbers. This alone should make you question the efficacy of masks, but for some strange reason people like you are religiously convinced that masks must work and are unwilling to even consider that they don't. This obsession with masks might be the weirdest thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.</p>

        <p>Are you going to provide any data? Or just speak in unproven generalizations that back up your theory?</p>
<p>Don’t you find it strange that Trump was staunchly anti-mask and his entire campaign and team got covid, while Biden and his team were staunch mask-wearers and they never contracted the virus?</p>
<p>Don’t you find it strange that you don’t see a single strict-mask-wearing Asian country on the top of the covid lists, yet every country with large groups of anti-maskers flood the tops of those lists?</p>

        <p>Where is your data? You seem to be pretty sold on cherry picked anecdotes. </p>
<p>I don't find it strange that Trump got covid. Millions of people have gotten covid. Plenty of staunch mask wearers have gotten covid. And I'm pretty sure the messaging has always been that masks are to protect others, not the wearer. So Trump not wearing a mask should not factor into him contracting the disease. But it's not surprising that the narrative on the function of masks is not consistent.</p>
<p>Your idea that Asian countries are all strict mask wearers is not actually true. Yes, mask wearing was more common in Asian countries, but it was never mandated and it was mainly to protect the wearer from pollution. You are misinformed about masks in Asia. And mask wearing throughout the world is just as prevalent outside of Asia. Mask wearing in Europe, South America and North America is just as common now as asia, yet cases, hospitalizations and deaths are all much worse. This should tell you that masks are not the factor that has led to Asia's success. Almost without exception everywhere else in the world where mask wearing has been extremely high, masks have had no measurable impact. Yet for some strange reason you believe that they work, even though almost everywhere that they have been mandated, they objectively have not worked. </p>
<p>I have looked at all the data. It's very obvious that you have not. You are right that the numbers do not lie. And the numbers clearly show that mask usage does not slow or stop the spread of Sars-cov-2. This is true for every state in the USA, every nation in Europe, every nation in South America, every nation in Africa, and most of Asia, excluding eastern Asia. Go actually look at the data. Masks were mandated, with high levels of compliance last summer almost everywhere, yet even with mass mask wearing on an unprecedented level, cases skyrocketed worse than before the mask mandates throughout the fall. And then with no additional measures, cases peaked and declined on their own. There simply is no rational basis for your faith in masks. For you to still believe that masks work just shows that you are ignorant to the actual data and are incapable of looking beyond your own preconceived biases. You point to Asia as your proof, but that just shows that you don't understand any of the countries that you think make your position stronger. And focusing on Asia, while ignoring the rest of the world just shows that you are not able to look at the situation objectively and are only concerned with justifying your flawed premise. Your obsession with masks is nothing more than religious stubbornness devoid of facts and logic. It's most likely driven by your politics and a desperate desire to not admit that you are wrong. It's actually quite sad.</p>

        <p>There is also a lack of evidence to support the idea that masks do prevent spread from the wearer to others, and whilst I do not have study that demonstrates that, I would strongly argue that the onus is on those who advocate for restrictions such as mask mandates to prove their effectiveness, not on those who are opposed to prove the lack thereof.  </p>
<p>What I will note here is the idea of the path of least resistance. When you breathe out whilst wearing a mask, the air you breathe out is not going to force itself through the cloth, it is going to go out the sides, bottom and top. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fPfGU1MizY">Here</a> is a video that demonstrates that rather well, despite it being the exact opposite of what they were trying to demonstrate. Note that when he breathes out with a mask, the water vapour in his breath simply goes out from the edges of the mask, rather than through it. It's still getting out into the air, and still just as likely to be breathed in by somebody near him.</p>
<p>I'm not an epidemiologist, and I haven't really looked at Asian vs US cases, so I can't really answer that one, but I will note that there are many other variables than mask use between Japan and the US (climate, standard of healthcare system etc.) that could be responsible. The only way to directly test the efficacy of masks vs. no masks would be in an RCT, like the Danish study, not by comparing the entire populations of two very different countries.</p>

        <p>&rt;ee that the virus is contagious and can spread through droplets that fly out of your mouth, so can you please explain why you're so opposed to wearing a mask that would potentially stop those droplets from being shared by others?</p>
<p>Disagreed even your master Fauci said masks don't really work for viruses. I am mainly against for the cut off of oxygen to the brain. This is especially bad for children. If you are  all so scared of the virus why not wear a hazmat suit and mask and leave everyone alone?</p>
