    <strong>Just a thought, has any considered using Street Epistemology (Socratic Questioning) to get through to your loved ones?</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone remember how insane politics has been in the last 8 years?  One topic that fascinated me was how people analyze the world to determine what is true.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>google it, watch vids on youtube, dm me if you have questions.  tbh I'm not good at it, I have too much of a pompous ego ;)</p></p>

        <p>I think everyone on this subreddit needs to come to the realization that logic and reasoning are dead. You're not getting through to these people. They're either to scared to go against society or they're true believers who would rather die than change their faith. Surround yourself with like minded people and remove yourself from the system as much as possible. That's what my goal.is for the new year, be as self sufficient as possible so I don't have to rely on these true believers.</p>

        <p>But these people don't have a view. They're just parrots of whatever they hear on TV. Trust me I love having deep conversations with people, but in my experience most people aren't independent thinkers and aren't interested in good faith dialogue. I wish it were different I really do.</p>

        <p>Sure, the idea is to respectfully interview someone about how they know what they believe to be true is true.</p>
<p>it starts with a claim.  I believe that Krishna is the one true god!</p>
<p>followed by a wonder statement.  I wonder how we could tell who is the one true god?</p>
<p>A discussion might start with determining how strong someone held the belief, how confident that they are that it's true and how open they would be to reconsider that belief in light of new information.</p>

        <p>I've considered it. Honestly I think it tends to come across as condescending. Suited better to when you can corner someone and you have an audience (the audience will tend to be convinced but not the person you are questioning). </p>
<p>I've never tried it though. Have you had any success trying it yourself?</p>

        <p>Some, but only recently.  My interlocutor stopped me and said 'I never considered that, I'll need to think about that' and that was really enough for me.  We ended our discussion on a good note.  It was a question concerning "cultural homogeny" so if that gives you an indication of what I was dealing with.  </p>
<p>The other I usually work with is the BCSM model when I can.  The problem is when I'm passionate about something, I would rather fight than change minds.</p>

        <p>I'd call that a success for sure as well.</p>
<p>Never heard of BCSM. Reading up on it now. Very cool, thanks for saying that.</p>
