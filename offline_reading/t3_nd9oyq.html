    <strong>Shout out to everyone that has NEVER worn the mask!</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanted to take a moment and give a shout out to anyone and everyone who never put on a mask. We may have been a little cautious in the beginning but stuck to finding out all relevant information about what was actually happening from the very beginning and never let up on the research required to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>For those that did do the research from the beginning without waiting for the TV to tell you what to think, you are the reason that subs and communities like this have been gaining so much traction. Never stop fighting the good fight and always seek truth no matter what's happening.</p>
<p>And, for those that came late to the party, always remember this and never forget that the people or those that closely examine the official stories/narratives of anything, and I mean ANYTHING, are not crazy or misinformed, on the contrary, they are probably the most informed people that you will ever meet.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, covid isn't the only thing they've been lying to us about. Many of us already know this but for those who still believe in the official narratives of many past events, I suggest you do your research. A good start would be your health and the food and/or drinks that you consume.</p>
<p>P.S. No more tap water</p></p>

        <p>I hear you on that. I began my journey about 15 years ago when I began doing a lot of my own research on anything from politics to war, health, science, etc. As I learned more and more, I figured the best thing to do was share that information but turns out nobody wants to know or simply flat out does not care.</p>
<p>Learning how the world really works and observing those around you who either refuse to acknowledge it or are completely brainwashed was a huge disappointment for me and losing friends over it was something I had to get used to. </p>
<p>Truth isn't for everyone, but meeting like-minded individuals along the way can turn into some of the best friendships you could only ever hope for.</p>

        <p>Hang in there brother.  Ive lost most of my family and many friends to this nonsense.  I have made friendships w people that are likeminded or others that dont give into the fear.  I also met the love of my life through all of this, so it has been allowing real to find real.  Try to find areas where people commune as humans and you will connect with folks.</p>
