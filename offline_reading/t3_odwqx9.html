    <strong>Regarding the vaccine and the constant shaming...</strong>
    <p><p>Riddle me this. We have people insulting us and claiming with absolute certainty that nothing can go wrong and that we are stupid for delaying the "return to normal", like.. <em>how the fuck do you know? These vaccines haven't even been out for a whole year yet. How are you ABSOLUTELY certain that nothing will go wrong?</em></p>
<p>Here's a great example: In March/April 2021, all we heard about were period problems, headaches, and occasional blood clots, but now in May/June/July 2021, there's been more talk about Myocarditis already, so who the hell knows what can possibly happen by November/December 2021?</p>
<p>I'm not making extreme claims like the vaccine will kill you in 2 years, but I'm also not claiming that its completely harmless because the fucking health officials waited until JUNE to finally have an emergency meeting regarding myocarditis, and thats no surprise... its EXPERIMENTAL. So with all this in mind, why the fuck <strong>are people supporting mandatory vaccines and even calling us plague rats or begging that we lose our rights</strong>, and before you go ahead and lecture us with "risk assessment", we can turn this around easily and say that you are the same people who acted paranoid over a virus with a &rt;99% survival rate as well, so don't even try going down that road. </p>
<p>Now after this realization, think, for fucks sakes, THINK for one goddamn second, doomers! Any concerns about the vaccine is usually either met with victim blaming or even removed immediately from other subreddits. Hmm, I wonder why? If they have nothing to hide, then a civilized discussion shouldn't be a threat, right?</p></p>

        <p>The media will just simply repeat the same lie over and over.</p>
<p>The unvaccinated are causing mutations, when the truth is that the le@ky vaccines are what are causing the mutations, anyone with the ability to read could discover this information on their own. But by just repeating the same lie over and over on the box.</p>
<p>The masses will believe it, just like how they believed that this shot was effective and safe.</p>
<p>What an absolute joke of society I am tellin ya.</p>
<p>What the elite want, is a world where you will die if you dont do what they say and take their shot. They want to own everything and leave us with nothing. The fact most people cant see this, is absolutely terrifying to me.</p>

        <p>One would think they want to vacc the unvacced so they individually get protection. Sounds altruistic.</p>
<p>But no. Somehow, the brainwash narrative claims that only a collective vaccination is protecting, for them. As says the meme with Ralph (hilarious btw).</p>
<p>So you would imagine every afraid vacced citizen is expecting to have a certain % of their surroundings to be vaccineful. And if not, they fear. For themselves. Any claim of being altruistic is just to save their appearances.</p>
<p>The way it comes out in media is so much fun since these morons are so hypocritical about it. Every time they fight I just hear this:</p>
<p>"Vacc the unvacced, they need protection! But also these unvacced fellas are plague rats, society needs to be rid of them!". Like fuck, if you claim to be altruistic, start by not nagging them lol.</p>
