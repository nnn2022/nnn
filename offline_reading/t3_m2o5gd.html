    <strong>Example no.37891 of how these people are just virtue signaling</strong>
    <p><p>This morning it has dawned on me, the same people who told me i need to stay home or i’ll kill grandma, the  same people who proudly wear their mask and tell me i’m putting the world at risk for not wearing mine, the same people who told me that my getting a tattoo while we were still on lockdown was putting them in danger and making the lockdown extend past when it needed to, the same people who treat me with vitriol for just going about my life, those are the same people who go out clubbing, and when i call them up to see if they want to go to the bar, they’re more than happy to go to a crowded brewery with me, they’re happy to sot at a table with 6 or 7 people none of which wearing masks. It all super dangerous and life threatening until it’s something they personally want to do. And then turn around on social media to tell you about how not doing all these things saves lives. Just some thoughts i’ve had over the past year. I live in FL and this has been a reoccurring theme since before halloween at least, it makes me wonder if it’s cognitive dissonance and they actually believe the shit they say but think it’s somehow different because they’re the ones doing it, or if they believe it, but they just don’t care, or if they don’t believe it but they want everyone to know how good of a person they are.</p></p>

        <p>I have a friend that is the same. When we’re at a bar sitting with no mask he says it’s the science and we are sitting so it’s fine.
Bruh, they just repeat what they hear from their  gods.</p>

        <p>Highly contagious in the standing / walking position. When seated the virus is above your head. This has already been scienced by sciencey people.</p>

        <p>Patience... deep down no one wants to live under a boot, it’s not human nature. It’s ridiculous, the Karen’s and Ken’s filming people without masks at a Costco are the same ones touching 20 lemons to pick the best one at whole foods (with two masks of course). I’m optimistic many of them will soon realize they are trading their liberty for food stamps and Facebook likes... it’s gotta be embarrassing for them, so better they figure it out on their own accord.  Lead by example; live your life homie✌️Big up Florida. Big up Texas. ⬆️</p>

        <p>I think they are just abandoned children (all grown up and lost the "relief and safety" of a free roof over head and free meals etc...) who found new parents (Society and mainstream news) and don't want to lose them.  </p>
<p>Of course like children they will at will throw away the yoke of Society to have FUN</p>
