    <strong>So about that CNN screencap of "6-month risk of death 60% higher for Covid Survivors"</strong>
    <p><p>The original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mwjgwj/im_terrified/</p>
<p>My friend (who works for the government in a pretty good position so I am assuming he is factually correct here and not misinformed) told me that this CNN segment was referencing this study from nature: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03553-9 </p>
<p>access to PDF here: https://rdcu.be/cjcxL</p>
<p>very interesting stuff. wait. what's this on the final page of the PDF?</p>
<p>Population Characteristics: The overall study population had a <strong>median age of 67</strong></p>
<p>Recruitment: Participants were recruited if they had at least 1 encounter with the US Veteran Health Administration in the year prior to cohort enrollment. </p>
<p>so let me get this straight. this study of "covid survivors" was done on people you literally could call "survivors"? they were old hospitalized men who likely had pre-existing conditions (im assuming if they had recruited people who had contacted the USVHA prior). i dont even understand how this is a study. i dont need to record data to tell you that old, already hurting people who are hospitalized for any sickness usually have a higher chance of dying afterwards. Hell old people are in more serious trouble from any hospitalization, i mean for god's sake <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3118151/">read here for what happens to people over the age of 65 in the 1st year after breaking their hip</a> and then remember the median age here was 67.</p>
<p>my friend had no response when i pointed this out. did cnn mention this at all when they put that screencap up? did they give context to who was very monitored? or was this just another fear mongering tool. talk about lying with statistics. darrell huff is rolling over in his gra- wait a second</p>
