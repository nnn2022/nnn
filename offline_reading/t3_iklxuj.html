        <p>I know people here will call this a paid shill or bot, but fuck, I am seeing people in real life with this exact attitude. It is fucking disturbing, though I do see people legit enjoying the masks, and the lockdowns, and the "New Normal". This is why I feel like we have an uphill battle here, people may actually fight tooth and nail to keep this going.</p>

        <p>People like this deserve it when they get lined up on a wall. I’m sorry but the people who worship authoritarianism deserve everything such horrors wrought on them. </p>
<p>And there’s something psychologically wrong with anyone who thinks discord and video games make up for social interaction. I am not the wrong one for wanting to actually be around people. These types of people are sick in the head and they don’t realize it.</p>

        <p>I mean, honestly, the lockdown was good for me too. Working from home was nice and convenient and I actually got more done...</p>
<p>But, because I’m not a psychopath, I recognized that not everyone had my cushy job and not everyone was in a good situation. Personally, none of the lockdowns/mandates have affected me or my hobbies much. But I’m still against them out of principle because I’m not a selfish prick</p>

        <p>While I'm sure some people have done well this yerar, in the first place he has overlooked the fact that these measures have been forced upon people who don't want them and have suffered immensely for want of any choice in the matter. If all restrictions were rescinded tomorrow there would be nothing stopping him from living this sort of lifestyle as long as he pleased, so I don't see why he should be against reopening at all.</p>
<p>In the second place, an enormous driver of the stock market's gains this year has been the reopening of society and the economy and the hope the restrictions and fearmongering propaganda will end very soon. If our societies remain in lockdown a lot of the earnings traders and investors are expecting now won't be there, and neither will be the increase in stock prices that is helping him come closer to reaching financial independence.</p>
<p>In the third place, I don't see why he thinks a vaccine will take a year or two. Russia is starting deployment of the vaccine this month, and other countries including the United States are following their lead. By early next year at the latest the lack of a vaccine won't be any problem.</p>

        <p>Your first paragraph is so true for me. </p>
<p>I was in tears last week because I’m exhausted trying to find a side gig, especially one that will interview me around my work schedule. (If I were looking for full time jobs I’d figure that shit out and take the time off work.) I told my mom that my life was fine before COVID...went to Mass every week, two good jobs, an active social life...and it was all ripped from me and I had no choice in the matter. Meanwhile, my privileged friends who, as I said below must have never had any kind of discomfort, judged me for not wanting to happily go along with the mask mandate in PA. Told me it was worth it to sacrifice the job I loved and in-person church so we could save lives.They totally ignored the fact that I never asked for this and I saw the things being taken off me as ESSENTIAL. TO ME. No sympathy whatsoever. Just be positive and wear the mask!! </p>
<p>They cannot grasp that the world is not all about them and their irrational fear of a respiratory virus either. And it's not about how they want to "work" from home forever and have a mask fetish and can get everything delivered to their door. I deserve to be considered too!</p>

        <p>This is the reason why we are doing this now but never did before. We can. Amazon. Grocery delivery. A myriad of entertainment options at your fingertips. Work from home. That's the big one because otherwise there would be a lot more pushback. People could never leave their house once for months and not think anything of it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was thinking about how this would never have worked in 2003 for SARS because not nearly as much stuff was available online. A two-week shutdown is all anyone could've managed then, IMO.</p>

        <p>Pretty uneducated for him to want the lockdown to continue considering the basis of r/leanfire is retiring from your job with less than what conventional wisdom says you should have saved and sorta riding out retirement. Stocks staying up and the economy not cratering are especially important to him, although he clearly doesn’t realize it.</p>

        <p>I saw something similar (although less long winded) on Facebook this morning. I’m FB friends with a guy who works full time for the baseball team I work for is saying how nice it is not to be totally exhausted on September 1, and his wife said that she’s happy he had the family time with him too. People like them are part of the problem and the reason why so many people scream bloody murder at us for being “selfish” and “economy before lives.” Not everyone has the fortune for their job to be way easier, or to work from home. Not everyone has a happy family and a nice house. So many of these people have never even had to be slightly uncomfortable. I can’t believe you could be happy with your job going down the tubes for a whole season so you can have “family time.” </p>
<p>I honestly wish people like this could suffer and feel lonely or depressed so they understand why so many of us want to reopen.</p>

        <p>I listen to a local Morning Show on the radio at work, and one of the deejays was enthusing about how much money he'd saved by working from home. All I wanted to do was ask him, "So all the employees of those coffee shops and gas stations and clothing stores and bars and restaurants and theaters and concert venues mean nothing to you. You know, <strong>the people who can't do their jobs from their couches.</strong> But you saved so much money, isn't that nice for you?"</p>

        <p>Back when I was working from home, I hated it. I only saved 20 minutes of commute per day. I felt very isolated as a single person living in an apartment. Then I lost my job altogether (I’m about to start a new in-person one, finally, a part-time position on campus) even though I’m in a state that has kept its unemployment rate fairly low. And yes, I experienced a drop in income, even with the enhanced unemployment. This messed up my grad school budget. </p>
<p>Personally, I haven’t gotten sick in years, lockdown or not. (I’m not the healthiest eater but I exercise a lot and generally take good care of myself.) And meeting up on Discord or Zoom is not the same thing as meeting up in person for me. </p>
<p>Seriously, who the hell are these people? And why don’t they just lock down themselves, and choose to avoid social events and eating out of their own volition, if they care that much about saving money? Nope, we <em>all</em> have to do it so they have a socially acceptable excuse to live that weird lifestyle.</p>

<p>Quoted for motherfuckin' truth! You know why I want to actually...you know, work, outside the house? Just to have something to do! Just to see life going on. And this is coming from a self-admitted introvert homebody too! It's just that the option to go out and do things without bullshit security theater isn't available that pisses me off most. And that other people are denied their good times, even though it might not be my scene.</p>

        <p>So says the person who prob never got invited to the kiddie birthday parties and was prob picked last for volleyball in gym. It’s the perfect revenge for these lockdown warriors. Misery loves company as it’s put. You fail to consider those who truly need companionship like the elderly or those who suffer from anxiety....more importantly. There are many who have no choice but to be out there everyday like people who work in a trade , emergency technicians and law enforcement which nowadays is a four letter word .  How about the delivery people who bring u all of those necessities u brag can be sent to your home?..if you’re loving this life of isolation move to Siberia where u can also live the Communist way of life that is trying to be shoved down our throats... just sayin</p>

        <p>I am not prone to calling people bots and posts paid for but that seriously reads like it was written by a PR person. Just the whole tone looks artificial and is eyebrow raising.</p>
<p>I am actually experiencing similar benefits in terms of less commute time (a little more than them) and saving money. But as I wrote before I am hating it, sure I have saved cash but I need the socializing of the office to be productive and I am not social butterfly! The not going out and seeing people was driving me bonkers, and I am not exaggerating, I was going stir crazy as someone who lives alone. <br>
I am also unsure what stocks and savings account he has though as both of mine are not looking good right now percentage wise.</p>
