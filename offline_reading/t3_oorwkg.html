        <p>There is NO WAY enough research has been done to say pregnant women should take this vaccine.  Good on 22 year old mama saying no.  I hope she doesn’t fall for the car bribe.</p>

<p>I also just don’t understand how these women are lining up to get a shot from companies like JNJ who are currently being sued for causing CERVICAL CANCER, and are now protected from any liability relating to the shot. Let’s use some critical thinking here, folks.</p>

        <p>It's straight up insanity. Babies born without severe complications are at no risk of covid. A healthy 22yr old is at near zero risk of covid (especially now the delta variant is getting more common). These people are insane.</p>

        <p>I wondered the same. Anyone who commented with a source stating otherwise was heavily downvoted and immediately told that their source is not credible. Yet they can just say “that’s not true” with no source and it’s acceptable. It’s baffling.</p>

        <p>The thing that gets me is even the MSM are saying children are at extremely low risk. </p>
<p>Here’s BBC: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/health-57766717.amp</p>
<p>WSJ, written by a doctor/professor: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/cdc-covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-side-effects-hospitalization-kids-11626706868</p>
<p>And the CDC’s own data (y’all gonna say your almighty CDC is unreliable, now?): https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-Focus-on-Ages-0-18-Yea/nr4s-juj3</p>
<p>So where are they even getting the idea from that I’ll kill their baby with my asymptomatic germs? Either people are dumb, or they’re bots.</p>

        <p>exactly! let alone the risk you take of potentially losing your baby!! Two of my close friends got their shot together on the same day a few months ago, and both lost their babies a few days apart less than a week later. They are devastated but neither admits that it was the shot that did it. Both even went back for their second shot. One of these women was almost in her third trimester... Crazy coincidence if you ask me.</p>
<p>I would rather hide in my house forever than risk my baby. I tried for two years to eat clean, get off all medications and rid my body of toxins, why on earth would I consent to an experiment now to "protect everyone else." EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD BE PROTECTING ME! If that's selfish of me, well I guess I'm fucking selfish. </p>
<p>I'm only 7.5 weeks along but we have been trying for a baby for going on three years now after we lost our first in 2019. No way in hell am I risking ANYTHING for this baby. Covid cases are so mild here we only had 22 positive cases in the area since Jan 2020. No deaths. It makes NO SENSE for me to get it. Even my doctors and midwife agree, thank goodness!</p>

        <p>I gave birth with covid and it was the most lonely experience of my life. Have covid itself was a walk in the park, even with a newborn he never caught it. But how I was treated with the politics of covid was the worst. They treated me like I was the bad one, but I did everything right, I did everything they said I had to do to stay safe, just to get it at the worst time. They didn't bring me my meals until hours after they had been sitting out. I couldn't get water brought to me. No one wanted to show me how to even breast feed, and of course I could barley get anyone to bring formula in there either. I had to ration my newborns food because no one would bring it to me. I couldn't even put my babies father on the birth certificate, something thats been a law since the 90s doesn't matter anymore because "covid" The scamdemic robbed me.</p>

        <p>Wow, this is absolutely horrific and I’m so sorry you had to go through that. That must have been extremely tough especially with a newborn. Sadly I’m sure this has been a common theme with COVID patients; they have been isolated when hospitalized and no family allowed to be involved to advocate for them, therefore the hospital staff are able to treat them however they want, which is terrifying in itself. I have a feeling this is why so many were put on ventilators and left to die alone. I hope you were able to heal from your experience and are enjoying life with your babe now!</p>

        <p>Right, that’s what makes their comment even more ridiculous. The post was about the COVID vaccine specifically and they are trying to say if she saw a baby suffering from pertussis it would make her want to get the COVID shot. Which makes zero sense. They can do the TDAP shot to protect from that and COVID has nothing to do with it.</p>

        <p>They are very toxic and basically an echo chamber on here. If you disagree you’re basically labeled as a horrible mother who doesn’t care about her child or humanity. </p>
<p>I’m on What to Expect also and there seem to be less shills and more open minded people on there. But still it seems like every time someone makes a post that is against getting the vaccination, the post gets completely removed by the site.</p>

        <p>It's just sad to read stuff like this. These people genuinely believe there's something out there that will kill all of us if we don't get this "vaccine". The global elite truly is our worst enemy.</p>
