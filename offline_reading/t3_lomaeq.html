    <strong>(Long) The Scamdemic: Boomer-targeted Propaganda par excellence (Or my experiences attempting to unsuccessfully wake my dad up about the new abnormal; help appreciated!)</strong>
    <p><p>Some background: I'd always considered my dad the more level-headed and less credulous of my folks. My mom however, is an obedient vaxxer who <em>loves</em> her some big daddy government, so I didn't even bother with her. I'd thought he'd HAVE to necessarily see something wrong with TPTB insisting on using the general populace as guinea pigs for their "vaccines."</p>
<p>Anyway, when some story on one of the morning ~~propaganda spectacles~~ shows came on about the jab being delayed due to weather, he was utterly baffled when I said it was a good thing. I called the 'rona a more effective boogeyman than brown Muslims halfway around the world.</p>
<p>After opening with the observation that the common plebs are literally being used as lab rats, even though I wasn't running on any sleep, I made damn sure just to run down the straight facts with him: That this is literally a cold virus (or at least more related than either of my folks are to me, \~80%), PCR testing being crap for this kind of thing and that the test's inventor himself said that you could basically make anyone test positive for anything if you turn the cycles up high enough, that (even by the admission of one of our state dictator's high-ranking minions!) they're counting anyone who died within 30 days of a positive test as a 'rona death, and how this would necessarily lead to said cases being wildly blown out of proportion. The whole 9 yards.</p>
<p>Well, technically it was 8 and 1/2 yards: I didn't even get to the bacterial vs. viral particle size concerning the muzzles, but I did bring up that before the new abnormal, universal masking of the general populace had only been demanded by our "public health" authorities starting last year in an abrupt 180 and asked if that sounded a little strange to him at all.</p>
<p>And do you know what his response was? Well, he was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the deaths attributed to the 'rona may have been exaggerated by half, so that's something. But the rest was disappointing, but not surprising at all:</p>
<p>- When I bought up the CDC data that it's more like a tenth (and even that's overshooting it, try \~6%) died of the 'rona alone, he said "I can't buy that." repeatedly and began to repeat whatever bullshit number (400 or 500 thousand) it is now like a mantra. He was so sure that the governments(s) and media wouldn't do all this if it wasn't serious.</p>
<p>- While he acknowledged that it might not be the second coming of the Black Plague like his wife thinks it is, when I tried to explain that coronaviruses are literally cold viruses and that the sainted CDC had its survival rate at \~99.8% for people his age, he was adamant that it was way more dangerous because "so many people I know have died from it." While he acknowledged, again, the possibility that their deaths could have been attributed to the 'rona, he was adamant that it's way more dangerous than the flu. I didn't even bother to ask about what kind of health those people were in or if it was just from the virus alone, since we were past the point where it would have made any difference.</p>
<p>- I asked if it bothered him that the government(s) were amassing so much power over said cold. Obviously, it didn't, since he just started going on about the ~~Goldsteinist saboteurs~~ "selfish antimaskers" and that "nobody is trying to take away their freedom." Yes, he literally said that. And he also insisted that nobody is being fired, fined or jailed for refusing to wear muzzles. That's gonna be news to a lot of people in Victoria, most of Europe, CA or NY, I'm sure.</p>
<p>- When I asked him if he thought it was strange that people were being held up as the moral equivalent of murderers for even the possibility of passing on a virus to someone who passes it on to someone etcetera- and if we had ever done that for any other past pandemics, he said that he would "feel like a murderer" if someone got sick and died because of him and "it's just a mask." Finally, he stated that "so many doctors and scientists said it could (not would, COULD) help, so I'm gonna do it." I started mentioning there are plenty of doctors and scientists who disagree with the new abnormal and he just said he was concerned about me reading "conspiracy theories," that "you can find anyone who will take any position," "your mind must be a scary place" and warned me to stop "being so cynical about everything."</p>
<p>I recognize I might not have handled that as well as I would have liked (I was running on literally no sleep), but in my postmortem, I noticed a couple of stumbling blocks for him:</p>
<p>- Appeal to authority was a HUGE thing for him. He genuinely seems to believe that these politicians, bureaucrats, pharma executives etc actually want what's best or that they're incapable of being liars, criminals, shills, or just plain not giving a damn just because they give nice, wokish-sounding sound bytes. ~~Only Orange Emmanuel Goldstein and his followers can be that apparently.~~</p>
<p>- It probably falls under the first point, but since he's a boomer and a "news" junkie, especially the alphabet soup networks, he still thinks it's the 1980s where the "news" is just Walter Cronkite trying to bring the facts to the American people and hold the powerful to account and not the greatest, most pervasive propaganda apparatus of all time</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anyway, I know this was long, but this is the first time in my life where I've genuinely been afraid for my folks' health, and it's not from the 'rona, either. Seriously, I'm almost to the point of getting on my knees and begging them not to get the jab, or at the very least, waiting a few years.</p>
<p>What, if anything, has worked for you all in waking up your folks, especially if they're boomers? I know it's a gradual process, but I'm probably on a limited time frame here.</p></p>

        <p>My condolences, brother.</p>
<p>Seriously, what is it with boomers and taking the alphabet soup networks (read: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">literally propaganda</a>) like its gospel truth anyway? I have other friends who see it with their boomer folks too. I just don't get it.</p>

        <p>I feel all of this. My parents are the same way. Both in their 70s , love their daily mass media, and they buy into all this shit. I was trying to tell them please wait a little bit before you get this experimental “vaccine” I’d like to see you again soon, but they think I’m overreacting. It’s mental.</p>
