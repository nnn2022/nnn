        <p>How exactly do these precautions demonstrate anything that validates being against vaccines/Covid protocols? What about these scans make you think you need to put the word "vaccine" in quotes in the title?</p>

        <p>A vaccine would actually last more than 4 months and provide immunity to the disease supposedly be inoculated against. This isn't a vaccine by definition, it's a Frankenstein immunity booster with a efficiency rate (90%) lower than the survival rate supposedly being floated for if you actually were to contract covid.</p>
<p>I'm not getting fake experimental vaccine injections every 4 months for the rest of my life</p>

        <p>Now I don't have a good understanding of the science of how vaccines work (yes I understand the basics of how they help the body develop immunity by recognizing the 'patterns' of the virus in order to defeat it during a real infection, but that's about the extent). But if there is a need for a second vaccine after the initial one, do you have proof that they don't provide permanent immunity? If we don't know the reason why there is 2 vaccines, it's not fair to make baseless assumptions like "frankenstien immunity booster".</p>
<p>Unless they state "you will need to take the vaccine every 4 months", I don't have a problem with a 2-part vaccine as long as together, they provide lifelong immunity</p>
<p>Personally as a healthy mid-20's person, I don't feel the need to vaccinate and I'm not scared of contracting the virus because I agree with the high survival rate point, but I'm not against the vaccine or see it as any sort of conspiracy.</p>

        <p>coronaviruses constantly mutate. There is no "shot for covid" in the same way there has never been a single shot for the seasonal flu.  A traditional vaccine provides immunity to the virus by building antibodies. This treatment uses MRNA which isn't the same thing. It also hasn't even passed trials yet, the current population rollout is the clinical testing.</p>
<p>CDC website with the slippery language removed: <em>"to trigger an immune response.... vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies"</em></p>
<p>Consider that governments have deliberately ignored safety complaints, clearly want the shots to be mandatory, and are rolling out "immunity passports" to restrict the liberty of anyone who declines. Consider also that the whole thing greatly resembles gene therapy and we have an extensive understanding of the human genome.</p>
<p>It should make everyone mistrustful of government intentions. We already know that yearly mortality is average and civil liberties are being suspended without cause. Either governments are playing damage control to mask one of the biggest policy blunders in modern history,  or disturbingly probable it is an intentional conspiracy to iteratively alter the biology of populations using the pretense of endless covid shots</p>

        <p>Good answer, I was following up until the “altering the biology of populations”. I don’t believe that to be the case and don’t believe various governments have interest in gene editing/changing the populations biology. What do you think the agenda is with this vaccine? You provided a pretty decent explanation before that, can you elaborate on that one point though?</p>

        <p>you don't have to agree with me. But considering governments have openly lied about their intentions every step of the way, I don't see what is exactly implausible about it. If you give a population constant mrna shots (which is what will actually happen) you can iteratively construct something which wouldn't have been foreseen after the first one. The exact contents of these shots aren't even being disclosed to my understanding either.</p>
<p>The agenda is totalitarian social control. The regime can separate conformist from nonconformists using vaccine passports and the ideology of "zero covid" (impossible) will be used to rationalize restricting dissident liberty. This has already happened in Israel and talk of vaccine passports are in the works, this is not a joke.  The endgame is the permanent erosion of civil liberties and personal privacy so one party states can be constructed.</p>
