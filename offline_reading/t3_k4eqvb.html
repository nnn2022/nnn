    <strong>What’s been a small thing that’s annoyed you about the response to the pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>For me it’s the moral grandstanding. It feels like so many people are trying to one-up each other by proving that they’re even more selfless and virtuous than the last person.</p>
<p>“Everyone check out my socially distanced mask picnic! I’m basically a modern day MLK!”</p>
<p>“We did Thanksgiving dinner over Zoom! It’s totally an adequate substitute for the real thing, and if you set foot out of the house on Thursday you personally gave everyone’s grandma COVID!”</p>
<p>“I’ve been in a bunker deep in the Himalayas since March, and anyone who hasn’t is a MURDERER!”</p></p>

        <p>I got a friend in Europe saying (not from super lockdown country) “if only people would have acted responsibly and followed the rules we wouldn’t have to lockdown again!!” </p>
<p>And I’m like.. I am in USA in a blue shithole, we never opened, everyone is wearing a face diaper, nothing is open or even gyms, and we are still “locking down” even more. </p>
<p>Maybe the fucking lockdowns don’t work?? Maybe there just is a new virus forever?? Shocking!!</p>

        <p>Not sure if this counts, but I miss smiling at people. I know that sounds strange, but I enjoy smiling at people, because you never know who is having a rough day and a smile can make a person feel better. </p>
<p>I'm also tired of having to ask people to repeat themselves because I can't hear them with their masks on.</p>

        <p>Definitely! The other day I wanted to smile at a baby but couldn't. I'm on the spectrum and although the eyes help you to know what facial expression someone is making, it's not enough for me, i need to see the whole face to know if someone is making a joke or is actually annoyed. This adds a huge amount of stress to my life. I spent years getting better at reading expressions and now I'm completely in the dark</p>

<li>Publically believing and supporting masks and lockdowns means you don't spread the virus. </li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently speaking out against the virus automatically turns you into a Trump supporting antimasker sUpErSprEaDeR grandma killer. </p>
<p>However as long as you say you understand the measures and you hate antimaskers you and 6 of your dearest friends are fine to have that socially distanced get together (minus the distance of course lol). </p>
<p>Oh and then you can go to dinner so long as you leave the mask on when you enter the premise. </p>
<p>Oh and you can travel and have gatherings so long as you make a facebook post about how "safe" you all are being. </p>
<p>The hypocrisy is so much but the freedom is more than I personally enjoy </p>
<p>It makes me want to become a covid hypocrite! </p>
<p>Let me just make a quick Facebook post about how serious this deadly virus is so I too can continue hanging out with my friends and traveling to visit my family. </p>
<p>Because if I say I don't support any of this, even if I wear the stupid mask, even if I have been more alone than anyone else I know during this pandemic, I've suddenly become a super spreader worthy of ridicule and social shame and isolation. </p>
<p>I've been disinvited to events because I'm vocal. </p>
<p>Doesn't matter that Karen was out last night at the bar because she believes in masks vaccines and lockdowns.</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone on the internet knows someone who died of covid. </li>
</ol>
<p>Literally had someone tell me they knew 8 dead from covid and 2 people claimed to have known a newborn baby who died from covid. </p>
<p>do you understand the astronomical and I mean ASTRONOMICAL odds of knowing a baby who died from covid? seeing as there are only 27 of them? </p>
<p>but one post contained two people who each knew a dead covid infant? </p>
<p>People are lying to shame and force others to comply. </p>
<ol>
<li>People wearing masks when no one else is around. </li>
</ol>
<p>there's no person near you for 5 blocks take the damn mask off</p>

        <p>Having to wear a mask all the time, but the worst is requiring it for workouts. </p>
<p>Power tripping Karens going way too far with their embracing of the rules and making up as many stupid “requirements” as the government when they get power somewhere. </p>
<p>Zoom meetings. In my circle I’ve been practically nagged/forced into them, even outside of work where I should have a choice. But not going is seen as problematic or not wanting to see my family. </p>
<p>All the smug nurses and spouses of nurses (there’s one person I know whose husband is a nurse and she acts like he’s getting blown up in Iraq) begging and pleading to stop our lives for them. Very few people believe that COVID isn’t real, but they act like everyone will die from it and end up in the ICU. The messaging should really change to explain how it can be fatal or more severe in certain demographics but you can also end up with a mild case and not need to go to the hospital. </p>
<p>Also, if hospitals can’t handle it at this point, why did they waste the last nine months doing nothing and why were field hospitals closed? Why do field hospitals sit largely empty? If it were that bad, those would be crowded too.</p>

        <p>I was really annoyed when they put signs on my town's benches that said not to sit on them. They were encouraging people to go outside for walks and jogs, and sometimes people (especially the elderly) need a break when they do that. People just sat on the ground or on rocks instead, LMAO. I got a really dirty look when I stopped during a bike ride and sat on a stone wall.</p>
