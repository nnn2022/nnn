    <strong>Questions to trigger the covid cultists</strong>
    <p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Notice how they can NEVER, and I mean, NEVER give you an actual answer to any.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Their behavior is simple: Ignore - Apply social shaming - Downvote - Censor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Feel free to add your own.</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER 2: A user told me he posted the answers, but mods deleted it. This is completely antithetical to what No New Normal is. We are against censorship, against people who stiffle debate and against cowards who have to censor reality; this goes both ways.

<p>Why did the US donate money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study "coronaviruses from bats"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a year of covid, a significant portion of the world's population has caught it and survived, acquiring natural immunity. If there are less deaths, how do we know it is due to the vaccine and not because people are already naturally immunized and hospitals are less crowded?</p>

        <p>Well, just signed up so I could reply to your questions.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>&rt; Why did the US donate money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to study "coronaviruses from bats"?</p>
<p>Not uncommon for research to be funded in other places. Often research in concentrated a handful of places. With regards to the lab in Wuhan they have (had?) a large program to study viruses in bats. That research is of interest to the US as well and so funding it was a way to get the research without having to set up your own lab.  </p>
<p>&rt; After a year of covid, a significant portion of the world's population has caught it and survived, acquiring natural immunity. If there are less deaths, how do we know it is due to the vaccine and not because people are already naturally immunized and hospitals are less crowded?  </p>
<p>Around 200 million people have been diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection, out of a world wide population of 8 billion. That’s not a “significant portion” of the population. Even if we double or triple that number it’s a very far cry from providing protection for the world as a whole.</p>
<p>&rt; If the vaccine is protecting people against the delta variant... Why are anti-vaxxers a problem? Why not keep getting safe and effective jabs every month/semester/year?  </p>
<p>Logistics, cost would be another one. But more importantly unvaccinated people have much higher chance of breeding a mutation that can either sidestep the vaccine or become more deadly / infectious.   </p>
<p>&rt; The virus has been around since December 2019. How come it wasn't noticed until February or March the following year, after months of not applying any travel restrictions or safety measures all over the world?  </p>
<p>It’s probably been around longer than that. We have had some evidence of it as far back as October 2019. Having said that, the chances are very good that the virus first infected people that weren’t all that mobile (e.g. farmers etc.). From there it ended up in the city, where it infected more people and eventually infected people that did leave the country. Simply put: It takes time for a virus to infect enough people to “get out of dodge”.  </p>
<p>&rt; How can the unvaxxed be "factories of new variants" even though we acquired natural immunity?  </p>
<p>Because you first need to survive the infection, that’s when the variants pop up. Doesn’t matter if you’re immune later, by the time you there you had millions if not billions of viruses “born” in your body. Each of them has the chance of carrying a mutation.  </p>
<p>&rt; Is there any evidence that can definitely trace the new variants to unvaccinated populations, or is it just speculation?  </p>
<p>A high probability. Positive test results will have to be DNA sequenced and then matched to the person, then the question is if they can identify where the person got infected. If they can follow this back then there is a chance to determine if patient zero was vaccinated or not.  </p>
<p>&rt; Why do we have new "variants" frequently when we didn't have any in all of the months before the vaccines appeared?  </p>
<p>We had variants way before the vaccine was available? The Alpha variant was found on a positive sample collected back in September of 2020, Delta was identified in December of 2020. Of note here is that not every positive test result gets DNA sequenced. Only a certain percentage, so Delta could have been around before but didn’t get “caught” in the sequencing until a large enough population was infected.  </p>
<p>&rt; According to Peter Hotez and Fauci, previous attempts at coronavirus vaccines have shown to cause antibody dependant enhancement. How are they so sure this one is different?  </p>
<p>This was tested during the trial, exactly because this was considered a risk. If ADE would be a thing with the vaccines you should by now see this happening, especially in the UK and Canada which both have relatively high vaccination rates. Yet, hospitals are not filling up with ADE patients.   </p>
<p>&rt; Vaccines usually take at least a decade before being approved. This one, less than a year. How did they rule out long-term effects?  </p>
<p>It takes a decade not because the process and trials are so long but because of the way funding works. Usually just getting funding for a new vaccine can take years, then every step of the way new funding will need to be secured. In the case of the COVID vaccines Governments threw money at the problem. You wanted to develop a vaccine? You got the money. On top of that usually vaccine production doesn’t start until there is an approval, in this case manufacturing started at the end of the phase two trial. Oh yeah, that empty J&amp;J insert? That’s why it was empty. The vials were produced before the tests were complete and so the insert was left blank and instead a web link was given. Newer batches will have a complete insert. If you want to understand the process better, I recommend "Vaxxers", which is about the development of the Oxford/AZ vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt; If the vaccine is shown to be safe and effective, Why can't Pfizer be held liable in case of side effects?  </p>
<p>Because in general the margins for vaccines are low and the public health benefit outweighs the risks. What that means is that the Government picks up the tab. Do you really think the Government has an interest in approving a dangerous vaccine (on purpose) when they are on the hook?</p>
<p>&rt; Pfizer and J&amp;J have been through lawsuits in which they had to pay millions after pleading guilty to bribery and adding carcinogens to baby powder. Should we trust them now on vaccines? Why?  </p>
<p>Do you take or buy any of their other products? Why? If you are so upset about companies having to pay millions in fines for breaking laws then really, you shouldn’t be buying anything. There is not one consumer products company in the world that has ever not had to pay a fine.  </p>
<p>&rt; Why is it necessary to vaccinate young people, who aren't at risk, while we haven't done that for the flu after decades?  </p>
<p>Flu shots are available for kids as well and in some places they are given. They just, in general, aren’t because the flu in itself is relatively harmless. In contrast, SARS-COV-2 is highly transmissible, even if the children can’t get seriously sick, they can still have a viral load that increases the chance of a mutation and they can pass it on to others.</p>

        <p>&rt; Vax advocates like Bill Gates, the WEF, UN, etc. have been very vocal about overpopulation and the causes of a "graying society". And now they care about saving lives. Why?  </p>
<p>You’re misunderstanding the UN goal. They aren’t interested in “depopulating” the planet. Exactly because so many children die young and parents “make spares” population numbers rise. Vaccinating people and not having their children die of preventable diseases reduces the number of children a woman has.  </p>
<p>Now, maybe you’re one of those people that think we need more and more people on the planet for whatever reason, in which case I understand the upset. But for the rest of the world having less children dying and instead allowing people to improve their quality of life is not a bad thing. And we <em>do</em> know that the richer, healthier and prosperous a society becomes, the lower their birth rate.  </p>
<p>&rt; Why are there nurses dancing on tiktok or getting fired for not taking the jab (after a year of not having the jab and working just fine) if hospitals are collapsing?  </p>
<p>Because it wasn’t available? You could drive a car early on when there were no road rules, no driver test and no license requirement. Once they came in you could no longer do it. Same here. No vaccine was available, so there was no other choice but to “soldier on”. Now that the vaccine is available and it protects both the healthcare workers and their patients its a requirement. Much like many other jobs have vaccine requirements.  </p>
<p>&rt; Why did China have people dying on the streets, but no other country did?  </p>
<p>I am not aware of this. China built massive hospitals early on to deal with the expected flood of sick people. What I do know though is that in India it got bad enough that entire families ended up getting wiped out (friend of mine is Indian and she got updates from people in her home town from her family).  </p>
<p>&rt; If the death rate is approximately 1%... How could you determine if the vaccine is useful? Will it be 0.5%?  </p>
<p>It’s not just about deaths. How well do you think would the economy be doing if 25% of the population is out sick for a month? </p>
<p>&rt; How do doctors or PCR tests distinguish between covid variants?  </p>
<p>Depends on the test. The WHO test that is most widely used checks on three DNA sequences in the spike protein. Funnily enough, the Alpha variant was discovered because there was a mutation on one of the three sequences. But in general the testing for the variants requires genetic sequencing of a positive test. This is regularly done on a certain percentage for monitoring purposes.  </p>
<p>&rt; How could you tell the difference between committed, responsible fact-checkers who want to prevent misinformation from spreading from actual censorship?  </p>
<p>How is fact checking censorship? Pointing out that something is wrong is not censorship. The original material is not removed. Censorship is when I cannot find the information or dissemination is actively suppressed (e.g. via filters). None of that has happened.   </p>
<p>&rt; Why is Peru having a 9% death rate? Why isn't its neighbor, Bolivia, having the same problem?  </p>
<p>That would require more research on my part as I haven’t looked at either country. I can see a few reasons:<br>
1. Different, more deadly strain.<br>
2. Overloaded healthcare system so people cannot receive adequate treatment.<br>
3. Perhaps something in the population makeup that makes the death rate higher in Peru.  </p>
<p>&rt; Why isn't the US, a country with little quarantine and mask usage, prominent anti-vaxx movements, high obesity rates and the "evil" private healthcare having an average death rate of only 1.4%, if not less?  </p>
<p>You might want to look at this again. Lots of places had restrictions in place to reduce the infection numbers. We will see in the coming weeks how it will play out in Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>&rt; Why are states like Massachussets, New Jersey and New York suffering from high covid rates while Florida and Texas, which did very little, are doing just fine?  </p>
<p>Are they though? The numbers on the John Hopkins website tend to tell a different story. Checking just now Florida’s 7-day rolling average is 10,452 vs. NYs 1,202 new infections, Texas shows a 7 day average of 9,661.</p>
<p>&rt; Are countries with low vaccination rates like SA, Poland, Russia, Philippines, Haiti, Ukraine, etc. producing variants right now? What efforts have been made to stop them? Why did we hear of the Indian variant alone, and not hundred others?  </p>
<p>Variants happen all the time everywhere. This isn’t a “design process” where the virus sits down and thinks what it should evolve to. It’s a matter of probability, the more infections there are, the higher the probability that a new variant establishes itself. It just happened that the Delta variant popped up in India, it could just as easily have popped up in Miami.</p>

<p>&rt; They aren’t interested in “depopulating” the planet</p>
<p>&rt; so many children die young and parents “make spares” population numbers rise.</p>
<p>And how is vaccinating people in the first world for COVID, which almost never harms children, going to improve health conditions in Africa?</p>
<p>You didn't mention the "greying society" crisis; there are too many old people in Europe, and the pension systems can't keep up (which is why they bring immigrants en masse). Why would they be interested in preserving the elderly now?</p>
<p>&rt;  And we do know that the richer, healthier and prosperous a society becomes, the lower their birth rate.</p>
<p>There's a correlation, not causation.</p>

<p>&rt; No vaccine was available, so there was no other choice but to “soldier on”.</p>
<p>Aren't nurses wearing masks, suits and screens? Why isn't that enough? What if the nurse is already immune? Why fire nurses if the hospitals are, allegedly, overloaded? And why were they dancing?</p>
<p>12) Here's China: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/a-man-lies-dead-in-the-street-the-image-that-captures-the-wuhan-coronavirus-crisis</p>
<p>Here's India: https://fullfact.org/health/gas-leak-not-covid-19/ (NY Post using a gas leak pic to show that people are "dying in the streets")</p>
<p>India's death rate is lower than that of the US: 1.35% (Source: https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-covid-death-rate-hit-record-june-after-calls-better-data-2021-07-06/)</p>
<p>Need I remind you of literal cases of distorted statistics in the US which exaggerate the numbers?</p>
<p>12) Yes, scientists are literally being obscured, supressed or shunned. Posts are being deleted, fact checkers debunk strawmen, people are getting banned. Not to mention how social media adds a "disinformation" tag to everything they deem incorrect. There are hundreds of cases, we post them very often here. Stick around.</p>
<p>13) Do some more research on Peru and Yemen, the countries with the highest death rates. Wonder what's going on there.</p>
<p>14)</p>
<p>&rt; The numbers on the John Hopkins website tend to tell a different story.</p>
<p>Here's Statista: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1109011/coronavirus-covid19-death-rates-us-by-state/</p>
<p>Way above Florida and Texas</p>
<p>&rt; We will see in the coming weeks how it will play out in Florida and Texas.</p>
<p>They've been saying that for months. Experts are still "baffled". Florida remained open, waves come and go, and historically, the elderly move there. Should be a disaster by now.</p>
<p>15)</p>
<p>&rt;  It just happened that the Delta variant popped up in India, it could just as easily have popped up in Miami.</p>
<p>Yet it didn't happen after more than a year of low vaccination rates. Only one "scary" variant out of trillions of viruses going around.</p>
<p>Don't give into the fear. The virus is real, yes. But this is a political agenda to bring about a more authoritarian and globalist society.</p>

        <p>1) Don't you find it suspicious that the disease sprang in the same city in which there was a lab studying exactly that? Why isn't there an ongoing investigation on this matter? Cui bono applies here: China is the only country which had a surplus in GDP after 2020, giving them an advantage over others.</p>
<p>Google "Event 201".</p>
<p>2) 200 million at least. Remember, it's been around approximately since Oct. 2019 without restrictions for months, and there's no way you can count the asymptomatic or the unreported cases.</p>
<p>3)</p>
<p>&rt; Logistics</p>
<p>Save for the fact that the vaccinated make up the majority of hospitalizations in many regions throughout the world.</p>
<p>&rt; But more importantly unvaccinated people have much higher chance of breeding a mutation that can either sidestep the vaccine or become more deadly / infectious.</p>
<p>This is exactly what vaccination did with Marek's disease and whooping cough, as stated by CDC scientists (https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-vaccines-can-drive-pathogens-to-evolve-20180510/)</p>
<p>It's like antibiotics. They wipe out a certain strain or variant, leaving only those viruses for which there is no vaccine. Naturally, those viruses would have been erradicated by the crowd, but now they have no competitors.</p>
<p>Again, why hasn't that happened with other diseases? Why aren't we vaccinating people forcibly just in case there is another flu, this time deadlier? And finally, out of billions and trillions of coronaviruses, only one variant was noteworthy; the delta one. And it's estimated to be 19 times less deadly (https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/07/instagram-posts/data-showing-lower-death-rate-coronavirus-delta-va/), allegedly due to vaccines; which shows that the deadly variant is not vaccine resistant. In statistical terms, this proves that this risk is extremely unlikely 1 out of trillions.</p>
<p>4)</p>
<p>&rt; It’s probably been around longer than that. We have had some evidence of it as far back as October 2019.</p>
<p>Months of unrestricted travel, no quarantine, zero masks... and it took from October to March for it to be noticed. It doesn't match the idea that the virus came from Wuhan; by that time, it should have been around the world.</p>
<p>5)</p>
<p>&rt; Doesn’t matter if you’re immune later, by the time you there you had millions if not billions of viruses “born” in your body. Each of them has the chance of carrying a mutation.</p>
<p>So, you don't need the vaccine after beating the illness? Why would the unvaccinated represent a risk after they survived the disease?</p>
<p>6)</p>
<p>&rt; Yet, hospitals are not filling up with ADE patients</p>
<p>How do you distinguish an ADE patient from one which was vaccinated and hospitalized? How could nurses and doctors distinguish such a case?</p>
<p>7)</p>
<p>&rt; It takes a decade not because the process and trials are so long but because of the way funding works.</p>
<p>Not entirely true</p>
<p>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/</p>
<p>https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/vaccine-development-testing-and-regulation</p>
<p>https://wellcome.org/news/quick-safe-covid-vaccine-development</p>
<p>8)</p>
<p>&rt; Do you really think the Government has an interest in approving a dangerous vaccine (on purpose) when they are on the hook?</p>
<p>Maybe if it's the same goverment that pulled syphilis experiments on unwilling Guatemalans and Blacks, the same one that provided funding to China's forced abortions through the UN, the same one who performed LSD experiments during MK Ultra, or sprayed its own citizens during Operation Sea Spray, or hid the casualties of radiation poisoning, etc.</p>
<p>Corruption, inefficiency and conspiracies are common in every government. Anyone who knows history can tell you.</p>
<p>9) This is a fallacy, and you didn't answer my question. Pfizer didn't just "pay a fine"</p>
<p>&rt; In 2004, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million in a DOJ settlement and pleaded guilty to two violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for marketing the drug Neurontin, also known as gabapentin, for unapproved uses.</p>
<p>&rt; According to a statement from the DOJ, the Warner-Lambert company – which Pfizer acquired in 2000 – promoted Neurontin <strong>"even when scientific studies had shown it was not effective."</strong></p>
<p>Again, Why should we trust these same companies with mandatory, mass vaccination?</p>
