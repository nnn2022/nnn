    <strong>A Tale of Two Cities: New York and South Dakota</strong>
    <p><p>I am a big fan of wmbriggs.com, and I found a couple interesting articles on there that contrast each other nicely.</p>
<p><a href="https://wmbriggs.com/post/34819/">South Dakota</a>:</p>
<p>&rt; If the past year has been good for nothing else, we have been able to see these sides more clearly, and how dependent each is upon the other. The government sets out the baseline rules. The corporations lend them legitimacy, for certainly these private entities would not acquiesce so easily to fiat without good cause. The press smooths the edges of skepticism. Without the mainstream press pushing Coronadoom, there would be room for independent inquiry and discourse with respect to the disease; in turn, people would not so readily accept humiliating regulations imposed by government and corporations. Every side of the triangle is necessary to keep the facade in place.</p>
<p>&rt; South Dakota is what it looks like when one of these sides won’t pull its weight. Coronadoom is the next level of totalitarianism. It brings in a mindset that cannot be reconciled with free men, free inquiry, or diversity of thought. You’ll still find folks in Rapid City who wear the muzzles walking the street or serving you coffee, and there are some businesses that put up signs as obnoxious as anything you’d see in Minneapolis (though a lot of these were closed). But Coronadoom is not all-consuming. It is a nuisance and not a way of life. Corporations still try to encourage mask-wearing, but they are friendly recommendations, not the NO MASK NO SERVICE signs those petty tyrants erect wherever the government lets them. There is something wonderful in seeing a Starbucks groveling with its patrons to “Please Wear A Mask,” then seeing no one doing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://wmbriggs.com/post/34297/">New York</a>:</p>
<p>&rt; Nobody thinks anything of this anymore. When seated in one of these outside non-restaurants, there is no fear.</p>
<p>&rt; I mean this quite seriously. I walk around without a mask, and have been yelled at, called a monster and murderer (yes, really), but mostly I am met with angry or fearful eyes. People back away from me, and any not wearing a mask. </p>
