        <p>I fully expect to receive a ban for this but, are the long term side effects the main thing that scare you with the vaccine?   </p>
<p>Would it make you feel better and help you to hear that no vaccine in the history of vaccines has <strong>ever</strong> had a side effect show up a year (or even 6 months) later? While yes, there have been vaccines that cause permanent-long-term-disability/side effects, every one of those side effects have appeared within days/weeks (99% of the time) or a few months (VERY VERY rarely, as in, less than a 50 cases in 200 years) later.   </p>
<p>I know it's scary. I know your mind (and other people) are telling you "But we have no idea, maybe it'll cause cancer in 4 years! Maybe it'll destroy fertility! Maybe prion disease!" but the reason scientists are not anticipating long term side effects is because of the way vaccines work (and have ALWAYS worked), remaining in your body for a short time before being destroyed. It is nearly** impossible for a side effect to pop up years later because it is nearly** impossible for the vaccine to remain in your body/affect anything in your body that long.  </p>
<p>The MRNA in the vaccine is intended to be destroyed by your body very quickly - however, in the off chance your body does not react to the invader and destroy it, all MNRA in our bodies are built with a backup protection - they have tails. These tails get cut shorter and shorter everytime they are used to make whatever protein that messenger carries the code for. That means that lets say it can make 10 copies and then it's done - the average person might get 5 copies made before the immune system destroys it, but in rare cases the immune system doesn't react properly and the MRNA is allowed to live out it's full 'lifespan' which is still only 10 copies of it's protein before it cannot be used anymore.   </p>
<p>** I say <strong>nearly</strong> impossible, because science does not typically label something 100%. Scientists will tell you that it is very unlikely that gravity will reverse itself tomorrow, but they won't say it's impossible because really, we don't know what's impossible.  </p>
<p>200 years of vaccines and studies have shown us that there is no reason to worry specifically about side effects of the covid vaccine that we haven't seen yet. Yes, you can feel free to worry about the side effects we know about, you can make your decision on whether you want to risk the blood clots or risk covid. What you <em>shouldn't</em> do, is worry about whether the vaccine will do something to you 10 years down the road, because that discovery is as likely as gravity deciding to reverse tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Why are you scared of a virus that has over 99% survival rate for most people?</p>
<p>Don't give me none of this "long COVID" nonsense, unless you're able to show how common it is, the severity and the prognosis.</p>

        <p>I'm not personally afraid, not for myself.   </p>
<p>I'm afraid for my anti-vax mother, who has been consumed by the "99.99%" survival rate spouted and is easy enough to manipulate that she does not understand that the people using this number are using it in defense of young and health people not getting the vaccine.   </p>
<p>For her being nearly 70, a heavy smoker with chronic long-term medical conditions it is very dangerous for her. The people in my family all conform to the conspiracy that covid doesn't exist and believe it's all a plot to hide the fact that sewer children are being raped and tortured by the global elite to take the adrenaline from their blood.   </p>
<p>Because of this, there is not a single person aside from myself in my mother's social circle who is vaccinated against Covid. Even the people who accept that it is a real disease say that they'll be fine because they're young and healthy, yada yada 99% survival rate.   </p>
<p>What they don't understand is that because the 15 people my mom associate with all are breaking restrictions, having secret family dinners, not wearing masks, and not being vaccinated, that there is a real chance of someone bringing to her Covid and a real chance of it killing her.   </p>
<p>The people who refuse to get vaccinated (which has been shown to be extremely safe) are all using the logic that "it is a great survival rate for most young/healthy people" and ignoring that there are unvaccinated people among us who ARE at risk. If the vaccine had a 10% chance to kill you I'd completely understand not taking it if you were not an at-risk group, but that's not the case. In my province you have a better chance of winning our vaccine lottery of 1 million dollars then you do of dying of the vaccine.   </p>
<p>And there <em>are</em> studies showing long-covid, almost 25% of patients with covid have long term symptoms. Here is one of them <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media2.fairhealth.org/whitepaper/asset/A%20Detailed%20Study%20of%20Patients%20with%20Long-Haul%20COVID--An%20Analysis%20of%20Private%20Healthcare%20Claims--A%20FAIR%20Health%20White%20Paper.pdf">https://s3.amazonaws.com/media2.fairhealth.org/whitepaper/asset/A%20Detailed%20Study%20of%20Patients%20with%20Long-Haul%20COVID--An%20Analysis%20of%20Private%20Healthcare%20Claims--A%20FAIR%20Health%20White%20Paper.pdf</a> though I'm not going to sit on the topic because I already know that the people who subscribe to NNN are not the type to change their minds on things like this from studies.</p>
