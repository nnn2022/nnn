    <strong>Why aren't mask mandates enforced against the media?</strong>
    <p><p>Most CNN shows, such as Erin Burnett, Anderson Cooper and Chris Cuomo, are actually broadcasted from NYC rather than Atlanta.</p>
<p>Despite both the state and city of NY having strict masking rules, I never see the hosts of these shows wearing masks. It's especially egregious with Cuomo, since COVID is about 85% of what he talks about on the show. And, oh yeah, his own brother created the New York law.</p>
<p>MSNBC is also taped from NYC, and none of their broadcasters wear masks.</p>
<p>Broadcasters from local news stations in states like NY don't wear masks, either.</p></p>
