    <strong>A Scientific Inquiry into the validity of Covid.</strong>
    <p><p>1 - covid 19 is the 19th variant... thus it is not novel or "new" so that is a lie. We knew about this as far back as the 1980's or so sayeth farmers, and it was the super bug of topic in 2000.</p>
<p>2 - the test to detect covid is suffering a class 1 recall as it cannot tell the difference between covid and the flu.</p>
<p>3 - deaths to covid in 2020 are about the same as flu deaths in 2018 or 2019.</p>
<p>4 - there are no flu deaths in 2020.</p>
<p>Question... With the facts already laid out - Did covid cure the flu or was there no covid virus in the first place?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Please show us a test that can actually FIND the virus, instead of PCR test data from the debunked covid test that even its own creator admitted since day one "cannot be used to detect covid"</p></p>

        <p>There was no virus pre-vaccine.  CDC FOIA response, as well as other government agencies all state that they have no proof of covid ever being isolated/found in an unvaccinated human.  The vax companies couldn't even make the vax from the virus found in human blood like usual....... because they had none.  Think about that for a minute.  Pandemic/people dying in the streets... yet no virus could be produced.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure there is a virus being produced by the vaccine to develop antibodies.  I think it's straight up population reduction and they're simply blaming the deaths that are starting to roll in on covid.</p>
