    <strong>Anyone else in the military dealing with this BS? Need to vent</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>I totally understand that I have signed a contract binding me to Uncle Sam, effectively relinquishing a lot of my rights.</li>
<li>I totally understand that signing the contract was 100 percent voluntary.</li>
<li>I totally understand that I am expected to follow lawful orders with no ands, ifs or buts.</li>
<li>
<p>I plan on serving out the remainder of my contract (1 year) to the best of my abilities....but can I just vent for a second? Are other units playing the same stupid games that mine is?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was quarantined in my tiny barracks room for multiple 2 week periods due to coming into contact with someone who knew someone who may have had COVID. Couldn‚Äôt leave my room to PT, take care of laundry, or take out the trash. I had shitty ass chow delivered to me 3 times per day...how is this healthy? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Married/higher ranking personnel have the luxury of being quarantined in their homes. No one is actively checking up on them to make sure they‚Äôre following the rules so it‚Äôs pretty much free leave/vacation days for them at that point...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>keep in mind, these are the same people that order us into quarantine. Pretty easy to lock everyone down when you have a big house to go to. I‚Äôd imagine things may be a bit different if they were forced to move into a barracks room in order to ensure that they were following the rules and stopping the spread. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if I‚Äôm fortunate enough to avoid being roped into a contact tracing chain, then I have to take time out of my day to pick up chow for HEALTHY quarantined service members. Sometimes I‚Äôll even have to replace someone who was scheduled for watch duty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people are starting to take advantage of this and are using it as a way to get out of duties/work. Feeling sick? 2 weeks off. Spoke to someone who was feeling sick? 2 weeks off. Used to same urinal that some with Covid used 35 years ago? 2 weeks off. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it also seems that people start caring about the spread when it‚Äôs time to go back to work. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôll go to a house party with a bunch of different people from different areas, but once Monday rolls around, I‚Äôll report that some1 with COVID was there </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-can‚Äôt complain, at least I‚Äôm getting paid, right</p>

        <p>Hang in there.  Also, from experience, there is always a decent percentage of service members who dedicate their existence to scamming the system.  It‚Äôs always been part of military life.    It‚Äôll be over before you know it. ü§ôüèΩüëäüèº</p>

        <p>Will do. I‚Äôll suggest moving personnel who live in homes to move into a barracks room whenever they determine that a whole platoon needs to be quarantined...gotta make sure they‚Äôre stopping the spread, right?</p>

        <p>hey man, i am not in right now, i got out a while ago, but consider picking up a copy of the Servicemember's Legal Guide, believe it or not you do carry over some rights that are not supposed to fucked with at all even when you wear the uniform. Legally, you have to be able to do things like receive mail that is sent to you, I don't think they can take that away from you, even on a lockdown, look up where there's a Western Union, hopefully it's also located at the BX on base, just have a family member send you the minimum so you can tell command you have received "mail" that you have to retrieve. Same with religious services, maybe try "converting" to the one congregation that only meets off base that happens to be near a grocery store, you're a new convert, so you gotta go three times a week to get acquainted with all your prayers and things, right? There's a few other things that you have latitude on , it's been a while since I have read it, but give it a look.</p>
