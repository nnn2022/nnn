    <strong>You know what’s criminal? Stores and businesses closing their bathrooms to the public.</strong>
    <p><p>I was on a road trip today and had to piss, stopped at 3 different gas stations which all refused to let me use the bathroom. Had to piss in the woods. It’s not about safety or the pandemic, you’ve just finally found an excuse to not have to clean the bathroom. Like where the hell am I supposed to go to the bathroom? And why in the hell are they allowed to do that?</p>
<p>If you stand for that, fuck you. It’s a violation of human rights. People need to excrete and defecate, and you’re preventing them from doing that.</p></p>

        <p>We had to move my elderly father in law across country last November, not by choice, but life. He has demtia, and is on a ton of pills, one of them a dieretic. Anyway we had to travel I-10, when we got to Katy, TX, a suburb of Houston, he had to pee, so I pulled off the freeway only to find every public restroom closed. I begged ad pleaded for someone to let him use their facilities, no one would let us. He had to pee along the car in a parking lot or pee his pants. The fkn douchebag attendant called the cops on us. We skedaddled, but part of me wanted to stay and see if the cops would arrest an 80 year old man. 
They probably would have unfortunately.
I hate the world right now.</p>

        <p>It's also a convenient excuse for hotels to not have the rooms cleaned on a daily basis. Nordictrack offers curbside delivery (they dump it at the end of the driveway right next to the road) as their basic shipping option or you can pay an extra $99 for threshold delivery. Give me a fucking break. It's all bullshit, every bit of it.</p>

        <p>Even when "normal" nightmare for me cause I have a fucked up bladder and have to pee every 2minutes. People never care and never help and got judged millions time for peeing everywhere, I'm supposed to pee on myself I guess. And its funny how they all act "heroicly" cause they "care" for others for "covid" but when it comes to everyday problems of people they absolutely dont give a shit. Nobody. Many times I plead crying and nope. And I'm a woman (I precise cause of my pseudo lol so no easy way to pee)</p>

        <p>And shutting down the water foundations. It’s the most annoying thing ever and a huge waste of our money (taxpayer dollars).</p>
<p>This isn’t Africa. We have water here.</p>
<p>And also, it’s super smart to shutdown gyms even though the main reason our “death rate” is that high because we have so many obese people. How is this helping anything?</p>

I've literally yelled at the employees that I'm just going to piss on their wall right outside the building. they are always too scared to do anything.

        <p>I remember early on this past spring, when PA started its lockdown, they closed all the highway rest stops. Those workers were declared non-essential. Well, what wasn't non-essential was truckers hauling supplies needing food, toilets, and places to rest. </p>
<p>Within two days, the policy was reversed and the stops were reopened.</p>

Insane that I was potentially going to be arrested for that too if a cop caught me.  I legit was wondering what homeless people did and was going to ask a homeless guy before I found a spot that was concealed enough.  Just retarded</p>

        <p>Okay, I kind of agree with you. I think some businesses found a reason to not clean the bathroom and that's why they shut them down. </p>
<p>But bathrooms are, actually, not a human right. In fact, public bathrooms are just called that because most businesses let you walk in and out of them without stopping you. However, they are not public and you do not own the bathroom. It is the right of the business to restrict access to whatever parts of the building they want. I agree with you it's dumb to shut down public bathrooms because we're in a pandemic, but it could also be because anyone who has to clean up the bathroom might catch Covid-19 from the surfaces that had any other human contact: sneezing, coughing, and depending on how else covid is transmitted, bodily fluids. It is most likely a protection for the workers.</p>
<p>You can always pee off the side of the road or in a bush.</p>

        <p>Why? Crohn's Disease doesn't stop you from taking a shit on the side of the road and wiping up with toilet paper in the trunk. Idk what other family in the ADA wants to talk to me, but at the end of the day there's a balance to maintain between accessibility and the rights reserved by private businesses. Just as you probably don't want to be forced to let anyone come into your house and take a shit in your bathroom, companies shouldn't be forced to do that either. It's nice that they offer the option in the first place, but they have a right to refuse entry to their bathrooms for whatever reason as long as it infringe on discrimination laws.</p>

        <p>It isn’t an issue of basic principle, it’s a matter of established law.</p>
<p>IBS/Crohn’s can often be serious enough to make otherwise able-bodied people eligible for handicapped parking passes.</p>
<p>The entire reason that the ADA exists is to force businesses to “reasonably accommodate” people with disabilities. You can absolutely argue over what constitutes “reasonable accommodation” but it’s hard to argue that it is unreasonable to expect businesses over a certain size to have publicly accessible bathrooms.</p>

<p>what's the difference between walking in to purchase a drink and going to the bathroom, and how is the safety for the workers any different? it's not. there's literally no difference.</p>
<p>peeing in a public place is illegal, which is my point in that closing public bathrooms eliminates all options. of course I'm going to just pee in a bush, but everything about this is a fallacy</p>

        <p>&rt;Difference between walking in and going to the bathroom in terms of safety. No difference.</p>
<p>I can name a couple of key differences, actually, as I already did in my original reply. First, the mask that you and the clerk both wear and the plastic barrier they stand behind helps significantly to stop the spread of covid19 droplets. In fact, if you're only going in to buy a drink and then walking out in this situation, the chances of either of you potentially spreading covid19 to each other (if one of you had it) would be negligibly unlikely.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to using the bathroom, I think it's time to pull out another article. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.09.004">Covid19 can survive upwards from hours to even days outside of the body in the form of small liquid droplets</a>. They can be easily killed using Lysol or any sanitizing wipe because it destroys the liquid outside layer that protects the virus, which then falls apart due to the surrounding air. Covid19 has a hard time surviving outside of a shell, and so that's why you hear everyone say it spreads through <em>droplets</em>. The virus itself doesn't fly around like a fairy. So when it comes time to clean the bathroom after people use it, workers open themselves up to risk by being in a bathroom used by other people, who may or may not have taken their mask off to do their business for some reason, or even if they've needed to spit in the sink or wash their face or breathe on anything. It's important to keep in mind that this virus can live on surfaces hours after being exhaled by people, so having them go clean up a bathroom that people have been using all day puts the workers at a higher risk than if they were to just leave the bathrooms closed, which they are more than legally allowed to do.</p>
<p>&rt;peeing in public is illegal</p>
<p>So is speeding on the highway, but one is a little less dangerous than the other. Furthermore, it's easier to prove someone is speeding than it is to prove someone is urinating in public, especially if you have your back turned. You can literally just say 'I pulled over because I got a cramp while driving and got out to stretch' and, unless a cop physically saw you peeing on the highway (which going 60MPH raises reasonable doubt), they won't have any proof unless you admit guilt. You can also cite a medical condition as an emergency and extenuating circumstance if you have a medical condition. Judges have thrown cases out for this reason. You can also pee in a bottle inside your car if you're really afraid of going to jail. But that doesn't change the fact that businesses are not required to serve any "human right" to use their bathroom.</p>
