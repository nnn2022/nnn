    <strong>What are your thoughts about Novavax, safety and social implications?</strong>
    <p><p>td;dr - what do you think about the safety of the Novavax vaccine and what do you think its social impact with me with regard to the vaccine mandates/rhetoric?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As someone that studied molecular biology, the exogenous RNA vaccines (viral and LNP) were not something new to me. Initially, I had some skepticism about how it was very convenient that these therapies with questionable safety results during animal trials just happened to be ready for human use at a time where they could bypass normal protocols. Now, seeing the way this has been handled by the media and government, my skepticism has become complete unwillingness to participate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was always some question about the biodistribution of the mRNA and resultant damage. Essentially, if some of the viral vector or LNP get into your bloodstream, they will eventually wind up in your heart and pulmonary capilaries (now we're seeing evidence of them being in the venous sinuses as well). The consequence of this is expression of the target gene in those cells. But if you're building up spike proteins in what should normally be smooth endothelium, your body will register that as vascular damage and begin sending platelets. This damage is further exacerbated by the fact that the S1 subunit will aggregate with PF4 and cause microthrombi all over your body. Inidentally, this would explain dizziness, headaches, myocarditis, and trouble breathing in vaccinated people. Even if it's not giving you a stroke, it's doing damage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, I'm thinking about Novavax; it seems like no one is talking about it at all, which has me puzzled. Aside from the normal issues that vaccines for upper respiratory viruses pose, such as excessive immunogenicity causing problems, no one is talking about any negative effects from Novavax trials. The big thing is that it differs from the mRNA vaccines because it uses a cultured cell to express the subunit, which is purified and then given to us. The biggest advantage that I see here is that with mRNA, you have no way to control how much it is being expressed. They control how many virions or LNP are injected, but the mRNA may linger in the cell for a long time before being degraded. More expression means more S1 particles in the bloodstream after cellular destruction, meaning more chance of clots and other issues. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, when Novavax becomes available how do you think it will change things? Assuming it actually is safer and assuming our government doesn't just ship it all to 3rd world countries, do you think this will push fence-sitters onto the vaxxed side of things? Further, where will it fit into the lockdown/control rhetoric? I could see it either becoming a diffusing factor as the vax becomes no more controversial than a flu shot, or bait to get more people to support vax passports once they've been converted to the in-group.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>I think is safer, at least in theory, than the mRNA vaccines because like you mentioned, we get a controlled amount of spike protein. However, if the spike protein is what’s behind some of the adverse events we’re seeing, I don’t know how much safer Novavax really is. I think we need to know more about the mechanisms behind the problems with the mRNA vaccines to answer the question of which is safer, but unfortunately that research probably won’t be done, and the best we’ve got is observations from drs and scientists who are paying attention and brave enough to speak out.</p>

        <p>If spike is cytotoxic, less in your body is better. The spike in Novavax is just what you get in the shot itself (your own cells are not forced to make it, as with the genetic vaccines). Immune response in the Novavax vaccine is stimulated by a smaller amount of spike antigen combined with an adjuvant (derived from the soapbark tree).</p>

        <p>Sure. But there were problems developing vaccines using other proteins. And the killed/inactive virus vaccines contain spike as well. Somehow I haven't heard as many reports of weird side effects coming from the killed/inactive virus vaccines, but the fact that those aren't in use in the West might be why. </p>
<p>It will always be a matter of balancing risks and benefits. At the moment, Novavax appears to be less risky, but certainly there's some risk. Actually, for me the bigger wild card for Novavax is its saponin adjuvant.</p>

        <p>I think Novavax is a better option than the mRNA vaccines due to everything you said. But, it doesn't look like they are going to get a chance in the states because of the government. At least not in time for many people who are being forced to get a vax to keep their jobs.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is exactly where I see the issue coming to a head. Are they going to prevent Novavax from being available so that they can keep shilling for the currently accepted pharma companies? Then, I wonder if it may be even more insidious. If a significant portion of people choose to get Novavax when they would not have been willing to get the mRNA shots, you'd all of a sudden have a new group to study for long term effects, all the while not being able to blame AnTi-VaX SciEnCe DeNiErS. Imagine the backlash if we started seeing higher rates of vascular damage among Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J victims in the years to come vs. the unvaxed and Novavax.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I convinced my GP to give me an exemption due to my current meds, contingent upon my getting Novavax (which I may procrastinate as long as possible anyway). But I really do worry about the long-term health of the people being coerced.</p>

        <p>It sure seems like they are purposely keeping Novavax out. I know how labs run, they can find anything to ding any lab on. How come they've only paused J&amp;J and are now keeping Novavax from being able to produce sooner but haven't found issues with the mRNA versions? I think it's because of Frauci's kickbacks no doubt. I find it hard to believe the production issues are that bad.</p>

        <p>The biggest difference alongside the dose control seems to be that the novavax spike proteins stay in place instead of roaming everywhere in the body, so it should be safer.</p>
<p>It won't be ANY more effective than any other spike protein shot of course.  The best option there is something like sinovac which actually uses inactivated virus.</p>
<p>And because we now have the mrna shots, there apparently won't be an EUA for novavax in the US, it will need to go through the full approval process (trials underway).</p>

        <p>That goes way beyond my immunological knowledge, what is gained/lost by using a live vs inactivated virus.  In general if a virus is dangerous you don't want to be exposed to the live version.  If it isn't, just go hug someone who is sick :)</p>

        <p>I’m not an expert in immunology either, but some basic childhood vaccines, such as MMR of the chicken pox one, are live, and we’ve been using them for decades without high rates of adverse effects (I mean there’s always some people who experience them, but these vaccines are generally safe). For people with a healthy immune system, live vaccines shouldn’t cause infection. I didn’t get diseases from any of my childhood live vaccines. They can’t be given to immunocompromised people, but since such people often don’t get very much of a response from the vaccines they can take, the effect in the overall population probably isn’t much different.</p>

        <p>There aren’t any live covid vaccines. But I think it’s worth thinking about the fact that the measles vaccine is live because when they tried to make an inactivated one, they had problems with ADE.</p>

        <p>ADE is the big question mark in all of these vaccines, and we're not out of the woods yet. It took 18 - 24 months for ADE to show up after the roll out of the dengue vaccine. </p>

        <p>I don't think the Novavax vaccine "stays in place" in the arm any more than the genetic vaccines do. The difference is that the genetic vaccines' nanoparticles infect cells they come into contact with (they enter the cell and turn it into a factory to produce spike protein).  Cells so infected then become targeted for destruction by the body's immune defenses. If those cells so infected are in your brain....etc. </p>
<p>Nanovax's protein subunits don't do that.</p>

        <p>The mrna lipid nanoparticles are designed to protect the payload long enough for it to spread, literally designed to avoid the immune system as long as possible.  The novavax vaccine presents the spike protein on a weak backbone that exposes them for immediate interaction.  They are unlikely to survive long enough to be carried to anywhere they can do as much damage.</p>
<p>This is a thread with someone who was (or seemed, it's the internet after all) much more knowledgeable than I about these structures:</p>

        <p>I'd argue that since it's being forced to go through trials and full FDA approval, it might not be on the side of terrorists. Phase 3 should be done by now and application for approval is supposedly going to happen in September, assuming it isn't delayed again. But, while most of us don't need a vax for covid, there are some groups that do. It's just like the flu shot: I've never gotten one, but now that my mother is in her 70s, I'd recommend it to her.</p>
<p>But that's where my concern for the societal aspect comes in. If Novavax is actually a safe option, there are definitely people that will take it to move on with their lives and completely forget about the impending fascism in a month or two.</p>
