    <strong>Why do Doomers think Trump’s diagnosis bolsters their argument?</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t get why doomers all the sudden feel vindicated on their pro-lockdown and pro-hysteria stance. </p>
<p>The issue of whether or not covid exists and can infect people was never in question. We clearly know that nobody is immune to getting it, even those at the highest office in the country. </p>
<p>Our argument has always been that the POLITICAL and SOCIAL responses, on a population level, were far too overblown, considering the characteristics of the virus and its infections. </p>
<p>Trump getting the virus doesn’t change our argument. Any one person contracting COVID, no matter if it’s Joe Blow on the street or Bill Gates. Their anecdotal infection doesn’t amount to data, and the data suggesting more and more that the IFR for this virus is around 0.1-0.2%. That doesn’t mean lasting health problems can’t arise, but there hasn’t been any good, long term science to demonstrate any lingering effects, only effects shortly after the disease progression. </p>
<p>So anyone thinking “Trump’s got it, now those Covidiots and science deniers will wise up” are still not critically thinking. They’re still continuing to use their emotions to argue, rather than data, science and reason. </p>
<p>Anyway, bottom line, don’t let these people sway you if you’re moderate on covid just because of this one instance, because it’s not a good argument. </p>
<p>And side note: They continue to show their cruelty and hate by actually wishing the president and republicans death. They’ve never cared about their fellow man. It’s about politics, control and moral capital.</p></p>

        <p>Ummm because these people are incapable of thinking logically about anything virus-related. </p>
<p>They also completely misrepresent our positions on their threads, assuming we think the whole thing is a fraud etc. In actuality, our position is that most people (including politicians) will eventually get this virus- it’s just a matter of time. And trump getting it doesn’t change anything whatsoever. </p>
<p>If it DOES show anything- it shows that no one is protected, even in the most controlled environment possible, where literally every person is tested who comes in contact with you.</p>

        <p>Well, I DO largely think of this whole thing as a fraud.</p>
<p>I think Covid-19 can infect people, sure--like the flu does. </p>
<p>The narrative built up around this not-very-deadly virus is a total fraud.</p>

        <p>This is my take.  Trump said at the debate on Tuesday that he had just tested negative.  Then he tested positive on Thursday.  No matter how often you test, you will never be certain that you don't have the virus for certain.  </p>
<p>Trying to outrun COVID is like trying to outrun a cold.</p>
<p>Trump's diagnosis changes nothing for me.  Since March I've been of the opinion that anyone can get this unless they literally never leave home.  It's not worth stressing about and not worth destroying society over.  Any sane person knows that anyone- president or not- can die from this.  The fact of the matter is that the vast majority will not die and we have a pretty good idea who has the highest risk of doing so.</p>

        <p>&rt;The issue of whether or not covid exists and can infect people was never in question</p>
<p>This is a key issue.  Doomers think, for some reason, that skeptics of lockdowns/distancing/masks, are actually skeptical of the existence of the virus itself.  They also think that we all worship Trump, they think Trump called the virus a hoax (he never did), and they think that we also believe the virus is a hoax because we hang onto every word Trump says.</p>
<p>Now that Trump has the 'rona, from their perspective, he is going to have some sort of mental awakening and realize that the virus isn't a hoax after all, and his fervent worshippers will follow.</p>
<p>It's all just complications stemming from advanced TDS, and leftists politicizing the virus (but accusing the right of politicizing it...)</p>

        <p>The left is very comfortable with assigning extreme views to people who don't possess them, for the purpose of justifying censorship, bullying, and violence. </p>
<p>Example: The "Proud Boys" have never been a white supremacist group, they barely get a hundred people at their few and brief events, but the left has turned them into this national army of literal Nazis, thousands strong, who are rampaging around killing every brown person they see. </p>
<p>Everyone who disagrees with them is a Trump supporter, a Nazi, a science denier, an anti-vaxxer, or is otherwise some illegitimate category of person and therefore it's okay to silence them, with violence if needed.</p>

        <p>It's kind of absurd because I used to watch Anthony Cumia's Network when Gavin Mcinnes was on it and had a show, he went from Rebel News, to CRTV to Anthony Cumia's network.  </p>
<p>I forget the order. But basically when he was on Cumia's network with some other right-wing or just edgy "free speech" comedians:  </p>
<p>He had this corny joke where callers would say "Uhuru" and he'd say 'Uhuru" back and "proud of your boy".  </p>
<p>And I forget the story but Gavin had this weird way of making jokes and it was basically like a homo-erotic thing about an older male being proud of you. Then it became a more common theme and branched into trad-male larping and all that anti-feminist stuff along with anti-PC stuff.  </p>
<p>At the time loads of speaking events were getting cancelled or protested by Antifa, in the case of Anne Coulter, Milo, Crowder e.t.c  </p>
<p>So the proud boys became like an actual group, they weren't pro-white, it was called "Western Chauvinism" as they called it. They talked about "venerate the housewife". A lot of internet loners seemed to take the group real seriously, then they started providing security at the speaking events. They became famous for fist fighting with Antifa.  </p>
<p>Around the time there was antifa vs rightwing fist fights and people like "based stickman" and that other guy who had like a shield became famous, that's when the group  became more uncontrolled. There was that incident they beat up that lone antifa guy and some of them got charged and Gavin then "stepped down as leader of the proud=boys", whereas in the past he'd meet with them and they accompanied him to events and he was videoed "inducting" some with the naming cereal and being punched thing  </p>
<p>. The group has gay members and black and latino members.. It's obviously not racist. It's basically like the other larp- "lets battle for Portland and take the culture war to the streets" side that opposes anti-fa and the black block, there have been many fights.  </p>
<p>So yeah I watched this whole story unfold over the years as an unbiased watcher who was just following the Cumia and Opie drama.   </p>
<p>It's so bizarre that the narrative became mainstream that they are literal nazis.  </p>
<p>To think it all started from a literal dumb inside joke on Mcinnes's radio show.</p>

        <p>Yeah their whole thing is super weird, extremely online, five or six meme iterations off normal, but "nazis" does not accurately describe them. I don't have to be on their team to recognize they aren't nazis.</p>
<p>But, you know, people who wear hawaiian shirts and carry guns are Nazis who want a race war, and the kid who defended himself in Kenosha is a white supremacist who went there to perpetrate a mass shooting, so we're way past the point that facts actually matter. Everything is narrative and propaganda. Don't trust your lying eyes, just accept what the blue checks say at face value.</p>

        <p>You're correct. As with most every issue these days, there's literally no room for nuance or ANY position that would fall somewhere in the <em>logical</em> middle ground. That's why I'm so vehemently anti both parties; both sides are continuing to go farther extreme. Although to be fair, I really do think the left has gone more insane lately, certainly in regards to this issue.</p>

        <p>I think even worse than those who actually believe this virus is a deadly apocalyptic plague are the ones who claim they know it isn't...but support all this dystopian shit because they are such kind, caring, empathic beings who want to save the elderly and immunocompromised. They are such compassionate and heroic members of society making these sacrifices to their quality of life because they are doing this for "the greater good", to "save others". Their hypocrisy and fake morality is truly the most disgusting and sickening thing about all of this.</p>

        <p>You are right. Unfortunately in this case, the media is going to use trump’s diagnosis as an opportunity to push fear. Dems will use it to push lockdowns. We can only hope that Trump recovers and doesn’t flip to masks/lockdowns like Boris Johnson.</p>

        <p>As a very left leaning person I don't like the way people treats the case. You can be disagree with Donald Trump politically without wishing him ill and it's possible supporting the left at the same time thinking we shouldn't be driven by fear. Sure some things like washing your hands, stay at home when sick etc. are good rules - but we shouldn't go overboard (thinking about other restrictions) either. Healthy people should still be allowed to go outside, on school, in shops etc. without mandatory masks and special need pupils should still have the right to accommodation in school without the COVID19 excuse standing in the way. What do I mean with that? Teachers not wearing masks so one can see their whole face for better communication, still use microphones and so on.</p>
<p>The virus is real and I believe it's a problem, but I think it's a difference between trying to solve it constructively and pure fear. With pure fear it would affect both the population as a whole and minorities negatively both health wise and their wellbeing. I wish Donald Trump well and that he gets better soon, although I'm a Bernie Sander supporter. Wishing someone bad is a bad thing to do.</p>

        <p>The president is probably the most tested and protected person on the planet. Even if he doesn't wear a mask, most people around him do. They are all routinely tested. It is also highly unlikely that the president and the people around him spend a bunch of time around the general population. </p>
<p>If anything, the argument becomes even more ridiculous. With masks and testing and being cut off from the public, the president still got sick. This tells me, even if every precaution is taken, if we're going to get sick, there's not much that can be done to keep it from happening. Just like it has been for the last 40 years of my life. We get colds. We get bugs. We get the flu. We get corona flu. Shit happens. Its all a part of life. </p>
<p>I keep hearing that 200,000 people have died from the Rona. Number one, most of those 200,000 peopledid not die from just the Rona. Number two, where are all these people crying about the number of deaths every flu season? Or at the end of the year when the total number of cancer or heart attack deaths are tallied up? I'm sure they'll say those things are just a part of life. No shit. So is a cold. So is a stomach bug. So is the Rona. People get sick. People die. And, not until 2020 have we ever had masks be a requirement. We have never been told to hide inside. We've never been told to stay 6 feet from other people. Explain that shit.</p>

        <p>Right? I didn’t see these virtuous angels wearing masks around granny a year ago during flu season. The flu takes 10s of thousands of lives each year, and as many as 50% of flu cases are asymptomatic but communicable. </p>

        <p>Because there's a growing problem of people living in information silos. You can get and curate your news from subreddits, Facebook pages, YouTube channels and Instagram influencers that already agree with you. Your uncle shared a skeptical article in the Telegraph? Unfollow. A subreddit posts news that "takes Covid seriously"? Subscribe! This kind of thing was already a huge problem in 2019.</p>
<p>We covidiots obviously need to cultivate self-awareness and try not to fall into that trap ourselves--many of us probably have--but it also explains why many Corona's Witnesses believe that "the other side" denies that the virus exists. They've been believing that this entire time. It's obvious why Trump's infection is a delicious gotcha moment for someone who believes that.</p>

        <p>Why did Trump hold those daily task force briefings if he believed it didn't exist? They can't explain that.</p>
<p>I've only become a supporter of Trump in the last year, but I think Fauci and Birx got into his head and scared him in early May. We should have been pushing to prevent mask mandates during the summer.</p>
<p>I'm very concerned about how far things have pushed in many states, but we still have FL, SD, GA, and numerous other states that are even more back to normal than Sweden. I have faith Trump will survive this virus. It's not even a question in my mind.</p>

        <p>The argument against people like us is the classic straw-man argument.</p>
<p>They don't think there is any nuance in the discussion.  To them you either trust the scientists and "experts" (including politicians) or you don't believe in Science™ and think the virus is a "hoax".  It is a psychological technique of them never having to question the miserable state of affairs that have been imposed by the politicians because they know what's best.</p>
<p>I just have seen so often that experts get things wrong, especially with something that is "novel" when there is limited data and it normally takes a few years to come up with an appropriate response.</p>

        <p>To try to put in perspective, you can just replace 'covid' with 'the flu.'  Trump got the flu and so did his wife and someone near him. Seems like a rather common occurrence.  But media has done such a good job of marketing covid as deadly that people will freak their shxt if you dare compare it with the flu.  Trump will probably feel like crap for while then get better and then walk around bragging at rallies how he got the flu and didn't die LOL!</p>

        <p>&rt;We clearly know that nobody is immune to getting it</p>
<p>Well we clearly know it's a scam, so nobody is immune because nobody had it in the first place. The flu goes by a different name this year. <strong>The numbers are completely made up to paint this insane pro-fascist narrative.</strong></p>

<p>&rt;even those at the "highest office" in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Politicians are scum</strong>, they rob you of any amount of money they see fit and send their armed thugs on you, that will cage you if you don't pay the mafia what they demand. If you refuse to get caged you will get killed by them. Blatant tyranny and slavery.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So anyone thinking “Trump’s got it, now those Covidiots and science deniers will wise up” are still not critically thinking.</p>
<p>That's the reason they wrote that into the script, I thought in April or May that they announce the trump actor "has it" or even "had died" from it, though I was wrong by several months, but it was predictable.</p>
