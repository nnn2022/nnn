    <strong>Don't worry about being 'banned' from a supermarket</strong>
    <p><p>I live in the UK so this may not apply elsewhere.</p>
<p>My local Waitrose has a one-way system, you are supposed to enter and exit using separate walkways.</p>
<p>As I was leaving, I saw that my car was parked at the far end of the car park, so I wanted to take the shortest route using the 'entrance' walkway.</p>
<p>The security guard moved to stop me, and told me that I had to go the other way. We argued for a while, and at some point he mentioned that millions had died from the pandemic etc.</p>
<p>Eventually he calls the store manager, who comes out to tell me that if I don't follow the law, I will be banned. Nevertheless, the manager ordered the guard to step aside and I walked to my car using the 'entrance walkway'.</p>
<p>Fast forward a week later. I come back to Waitrose and the security guard asks me whether I would like a mask, I respond with 'no thanks'. He then mentions casually that 'I do believe you are banned, sir', but makes no attempt to stop me.</p>
<p>This is how it works: </p>
<p>They create the illusion of 'punishment' for not following the rules, when in reality, all you have to endure is a brief conversation.</p></p>

        <p>Remember, if a security guard touches you it is assault. They have no legal right to touch you like any private person &amp; police can be called if they do. You also have the right to sue them individually &amp; the business as a whole if they assault you &amp; a police report will help with that lawsuit even if the police do not assist you.</p>

        <p>Security guards have often impeded people trying to escape from fire and other emergencies.</p>
<p>I am sure that many security guards helped to prevent families from seeing their loved ones in hospital/care homes.</p>
<p>They are not to be trusted.</p>

        <p>That’s so untrue lmao bouncers/private security can kick you off of the property by force if you’ve been made aware by the owner you’re not welcome anymore and refuse to leave. You don’t need <em>a badge</em> to force trespassers off your property wtf that goes against half of what this sub is about lol</p>

<p>No they cannot. They have no special powers - they are citizens. They are allowed to act in self defense but like anyone else can't simply go around beating people up. Their powers are telling you to leave &amp; if you don't they can call the police to remove you - that is literally it.</p>

        <p>Any person can touch you to stop you from committing a crime or in the preservation of life. The security guard can use reasonable force to detain you if there is reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed or about to be, just like everyone else. You’ll not get very far attempting to sue an individual or business for emotional distress. If you are assaulted this is a police matter and you can be awarded damages made payable by the defendant if found guilty. </p>
<p>Someone mentioned self defence. Do not rely on an individual to harm you in order for you to defend yourself. A preemptive strike is still self defence if you believe you are at risk of being harmed. Just as the security guard needs reasonable suspicion to be physical with you, you need to prove reasonable suspicion you are at risk of being harmed and if you believe this you should definitely strike first. Certain language such as “I honestly believed my life was in danger” will save you from prosecution.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience in Savers. Some rent a gob twenty year old lad trying to educate me on the pandemic because I wanted to take a shorter route to get some toothpaste. He genuinely said to me when I collected it ‘don’t blame me when you’re on a ventilator’. I’m 28 years old mate and capable of thinking for myself.</p>

        <p>They'd be required to file something akin to trespass on you to tell you that you're 'banned'. </p>
<p>Similar happened to be locally.  I am a vet, I have spinal trauma so walking for me after two failed surgeries is painful and I don't do long walks.  My partner and I went to a hardware store recently and I was having some significant pain and my car was parked right next to the entrance. 
I headed for the "in" door, and was stopped by an employee telling me I had to go out the exit. 
All I said was "I'm not.. You can see I'm having trouble walking comfortably, I am not doing it, period the end.  Move out of my way please".  Then I got the 'grandma died blah blah' to wit my response was "Do you really... believe that this fucking virus knows which way I am walking?  Do you?  How is me exiting this door any different than walking around people in the aisles? It isn't, it's theater and I'm not doing it, please move".
And she did.  She just moved out of the way, I was followed out by a handful of other people who didn't walk all the way around as well.</p>
<p>It is a STUPID idea, that we can only go one way.  This is what happens when every moron gets their input into "what should be done to keep people safe"... Fucking stupidity at its finest.</p>

        <p>Yes, I understand the law.<br>
At the hardware store I was at the manager etc would need to "ask me to leave" and not return.  That didn't happen.  Also Police would need to be notified of it occurring, they can say whatever they want and I can simply reply "I didn't hear them".  The onus is on them to prove I was aware I wasn't allowed on the property.  I don't have to understand the order, just be aware of it.  </p>
<p>Either way, none of that was done in my incident nor the original.</p>
<p>As a side note I was at the same hardware store tonight and all of the covid restrictions and what not had been completely removed.</p>

        <p>There are these "Security Guards" in Grocery Stores at my local Asia Town. There are all at least 400lbs and I kid you not I once saw one of them sleeping and snoring loudly on the job. I miss 2019.</p>
