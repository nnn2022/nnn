    <strong>I finally broke down and put in a request to move to a part time work schedule.</strong>
    <p><p>It’s been a rough 6 months. Single mom, 3 kids, FT wfh, small city apartment. I’ve been struggling for many weeks, maybe months with caring for my kids and working. Everyone assumed my kids were old enough to entertain themselves all day at 13, 10 &amp; 8. At first it was okay. It wore on as time continued. They haven’t done much outside of this house and are BORED. The final straw for me was getting an email from our apartment manager letting us know several people have complained about my kids being too loud during the day while they’re on calls and at night while they’re trying to sleep. ‘It’s summer time and everyone has their windows open. Please be more mindful’. I’m not sure wtf they expect. Our local park was the victim of Chaz (Seattle,wa). I weighed my options and decided I could go to 24 hours/ 3 - 8hr days and hope I get approved for unemployment. I was also considering quitting. </p>
<p>I grew up single mom poor. I’ve worked since I was 15. The only lapse in my work history is when I was pregnant at 17 &amp; quit to focus on graduating high school or at 19 when my mom moved us across the country back home after leaving her 2nd husband. I only took 6 weeks off with my 2nd &amp; 3rd kid because I couldn’t afford to take any more. I’m finally in a place where I’m comfortable at 31 and it’s possible I might have to move in with my grandma &amp; mom (same house) if things don’t get better soon. I’m terrified of being forced back into poverty.</p></p>

        <p>I am so sorry that you have such ahole neighbors.  I cannot imagine the challenges you face as a parent let alone a single parent during this time. Don't believe you are being forced back into poverty.  Boy do I get that fear!  I have been teetered on the edge myself for longer than I care to admit.  I do my best to trust the Universe and focus on what I do have, which is shelter, food and an awakened mind.  Not to sound trite, but gratitude is a powerful force.  It is not to negate struggle, but by focusing on what we do have with as much attention as possible, it can energetically shift our external world.  I am sending love and strength.</p>

        <p>Best of luck to you! I've been laid off from one of my jobs since march and lost clients from the other and it's definitely stressful, and I don't have kids so I can't even imagine. I hope things work out</p>

        <p>You are not insane nor alone. Raising kids is tough enough without forcing them to be cooped up in a small place. Seattle is full of entitled childfree adult brats too.   </p>
<p>Serious question, what value are you getting out of staying in Seattle? It doesn’t sound like you have a glamorous job, and the cost of living is probably insane, and I am pessimistic that they’ll ever un-lockdown.</p>

        <p>I don’t have much to stay for. My job isn’t worth staying for but it was going to be enough while I finished school. I’m still not sure where to go from here. Lease it up at the end of December and I’d like to move. Just don’t know where yet.</p>
