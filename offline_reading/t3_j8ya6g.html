    <strong>Thoughts on reinfections?</strong>
    <p><p>There's been more cases of reinfections reported in my state and wondering what to make of it. They said antibodies fade after a few months and that's why they got reinfected. I'm not sure how this is possible, because I do remember they took samples from SARS survivors and found that while antibodies had vanished after a year or two years, they had T cells that lasted for at least 11 years. </p>
<p>In Sweden, 30% of the Swedish blood samples had SARS-COV-2 specific (acquired from infection with COVID) T cells, even though at that time (May) only 10-15% of that population sampled had antibodies that were specific to SARS-COV-2.</p>
<p>Sweden seems to be having a spike in cases as well and it's making me nervous.</p></p>

        <p>Registered Nurse here.  A PCR test is simply testing for the presence of the virus, and says nothing whatsoever about immunity.</p>
<p>For example.  I had a miserable case of chickenpox as a child, and I am VERY immune (as in, I will never again become SICK with chickenpox).  However, if I were exposed to the chickenpox VIRUS somewhere and then you ran a PCR test on me soon after, <em>I would test positive.</em>  This has been ONE of the problems with use of PCR tests‚Äîthese are not and have never been designed to diagnose illness.  </p>
<p>So these so-called ‚Äúreinfections‚Äù are just the PCR test picking up on 1) dead virus that isn‚Äôt infectious because it‚Äôs not functional, or 2) ‚Äúlive‚Äù virus that is STILL not infectious, because if that person is asymptomatic, that means that they are now immune.  So-called ‚Äúasymptomatic reinfection‚Äù is just a warped, twisted, politicized way of saying ‚Äúimmune.‚Äù  This is how immunity has always worked, the media is just deliberately stoking the panic because they have no soul. üôÑü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>what Ab tests measure and what PCR tests measure are 2 different things.  PCR doesnt differentiate between active and dead virus either, and can detect very small amounts. You can have immunity and also test positive. </p>
<p>Immunity to coronaviruses lasts at least a year, more likely 2, and often 2nd infections are not as severe. There have also been studies that show people who have had common cold coronavirus have significant immunity to covid.</p>

        <p>You should be worried. Reinfections do occur. There have been some cases where the first infection was symptomatic and the reinfection was Asymptomatic. It's a very efficient virus we are dealing with. </p>

        <p>Did you not read the above explanation by an RN? Because it‚Äôs spot on and reading it may help you not spout off like this when you clearly have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. </p>
<p>Also yes, covid is an efficient virus. Which is good, means it‚Äôs not very deadly. The big bad kill everyone viruses aren‚Äôt very efficient because they kill before they get a chance to spread. An efficient virus is a low mortality rate virus.</p>

        <p>RN here.... These people don't listen to what we have to say. I had da COVID in May, retested in August and no antibodies. Been just wearing a regular mask for months.... Still don't have da COVID. So...hmmmm.... I'm sure with flu season starting they'll start to pad the COVID death numbers. Sad.</p>

        <p>Why am I mad? A handful of people globally have gotten reinfected with a virus that‚Äôs affected tens of millions but more likely a hundred million? And only 2 cases look worse the second time than the first and one of them - like I said - is 89 years old and would‚Äôve died of something?</p>
<p>Are you jealous you‚Äôre still in lockdown Australia? At least I can leave my house and go further than 5 miles from it</p>
<p>EDIT: 0.000028% of reinfection. Golly I‚Äôm terrified</p>

<p>Hahaha, mate I'm in QLD. Normal life here you wouldn't even think there was anything wrong. No masks, public transport, restaurants and clubs open. We had boarder closures (still do) and a hard lock down for a few weeks. Now we are as of today sitting at 7 active cases (in isolation) with 0 community transition and have been for months now. 6 deaths in total.</p>
<p>You should be jealous tbh. Also when we get sick we don't go bankrupt.</p>

With the virus only known about for 9 months. So long lasting. No virus has ever been know to have longer lasting effects /s</p>
<p>I‚Äôll take my chances. I literally have a greater chance of dying in a car accident you misogynistic troll. Go crawl back into your mother‚Äôs basement</p>

        <p>Well now I am just curious to know what part of any of my comments were misogynistic? Point it out to me and I will delete my reddit acount.</p>
<p>Your analogy comparing coronavirus to car accident deaths is bad. Not to mention a pretty much word for word quote from trump who is Mr misogynistic.</p>
<p>We know that, unlike car accidents, coronavirus cases ‚Äî and, therefore, deaths ‚Äî can expand exponentially. Someone with the virus can infect two to three others. Out of every hundred people who contract it, experts believe one will die. That rate of spread has meant that the number of coronavirus cases in the United States has jumped to nearly 50,000 from 8,000 a week ago.</p>
<p>To fairly compare car accidents to the virus, then, we would need to imagine that the bounds of the problem were similar. We‚Äôd need to imagine, for example, that from March 4 to March 14, the number of deaths from car accidents increased by a factor of 10. And that, from March 14 to March 24, it had done so again. Do you think that if the number of vehicle deaths increased 100-fold over two weeks there wouldn‚Äôt be a sudden push to limit driving?</p>
<p>And that's an article from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/24/your-analogy-comparing-coronavirus-car-accident-deaths-is-bad/">March</a>...</p>

        <p>Well if we can‚Äôt stop it, then why are we trying? If reinfections are a thing then vaccines won‚Äôt work - the science behind it is exactly the same.</p>
<p>If there‚Äôs no known scientific way out of this than what are we waiting for? Alien magic? People aren‚Äôt going to stand for this nonsense forever.</p>

<p>I don't support any policies that disadvantage anyone. Your country, its lack of education, and the people they vote in are the cause of the issues you are stating.  I don't see how anyone can justify more sickness and death = better lives for everyone.  Heard immunity, assuming that's what you're trying to get at here, has never been a successful strategy in any political, scientific or historical degree.</p>

        <p>Also if you‚Äôre such a big fan of AOC why are you supporting policies than disproportionately hurt the poor and POC, have destroyed about 30 years of women‚Äôs advancements in the workplace, is the greatest wealth transfer from the poor to the rich in a century, dramatically increase the learning gap between wealthy white and Asian children and poor brown and black children - and children with learning disabilities.</p>
