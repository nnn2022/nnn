        <p>&rt;It's from the VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System). It's a CDC resource.</p>
<p>But not a good one to draw conclusive proof from, <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/dataguide.html">here</a> is their disclaimer about the data and a couple of things to keep in mind from their disclaimer. </p>
<p><em>"When evaluating data from VAERS, it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. Reports of all possible associations between vaccines and adverse events (possible side effects) are filed in VAERS. Therefore, VAERS collects data on any adverse event following vaccination, be it coincidental or truly caused by a vaccine. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event"</em></p>
<p>Also: <em>"VAERS reports can be submitted voluntarily by anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, or family members."</em></p>
<p>And even more important: <em>"A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine."</em></p>
<p>Just because data exists, does not make it useful for drawing conclusions or linking cause and effect.</p>

        <p>You're missing the point, anyone can enter them and without any way of knowing which are confirmed, accurate and tested, there is no causation that can be drawn from the reporting. </p>
<p>Even trending or common info could be totally made up or could be the result of expected outcomes, like a type placebo effect.</p>

        <p>Well when you do report you have to indicate by federal law that you are telling the truth. Many are input by drs. And think of the o so many more that dont make it there..  because people dont know about it, are being gaslit by their drs and msm, or just have trouble figuring site out themselves and give up. so who knows the real extent of it. know. We all need implanted health regulator chip thingies within our bodies to report our status at all times and be sure no one is lying etc etc. - and even better attach these to our bank accounts id etc - i think the army is working on something like that. Stay tuned 🙄</p>

        <p>Dude there are obviously tons of people who spend their free time filling out fraudulent vaers reports. I mean it sounds like fun right? </p>
<p>The only other explanation is Russian disinformation. They want you to be scared of the jab so they submitted bogus reports, probably while working with trump. </p>
<p>It couldn't possibly be doctors and care takers reporting actual side effects because the news said that they were safe</p>

        <p>In case there are still some that don't know, Harvard did a study in 2010 looking into how accurate VAERS is. They found that fewer than 1% adverse events were reported. 
That doesn't mean that the exact same us true now but it's certainly an indication that under reporting is the norm and needs to be considered.</p>

        <p>I think 15 years of all vaccinations is going to be quite a bit larger than 4 months of one vaccine.  Think about how many vaccines you get as a baby, minimum four shots every 4 months.  And that's basically everyone in America. And Europe, not to mention the rest of the world.  And then there's adult vaccinations including hepatitis and flu, tennis boosters and everything else.  We haven't an administered anywhere near that many covid vaccines.</p>

        <p>CDC is the source?  Okay.  Here's what CDC says...</p>
<p>&rt; Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through May 03, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths. CDC and FDA will continue to investigate reports of adverse events, including deaths, reported to VAERS.</p>

        <p>Are you playing dumb, to troll, or being serious?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/08/dr_birx_unlike_some_countries_if_someone_dies_with_covid-19_we_are_counting_that_as_a_covid-19_death.html">https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/08/dr_birx_unlike_some_countries_if_someone_dies_with_covid-19_we_are_counting_that_as_a_covid-19_death.html</a></p>
<p>There's video of Deborah Birx explaining that Covid-19 deaths include all deaths are counted whether or not Covid-19 was the actual cause of death. Depending on location and time, this included all deaths within 30-60 days of a "positive Covid-19 test."</p>
<p>But those PCR tests had the cycle threshold pushed to the point that they deliberately caused false positives. A Canadian official this week unintentionally revealed that about 50% of Covid-19 tests are false positives. That's what happens when you push the cycle threshold too far in a test that is exponential in nature.</p>
<p>And then you have the CDC document encouraging doctors to <strong>assume</strong> Covid-19 deaths in cases where there are no tests actually done. A single page document and that is the only bold text on the entire page. Couple that with increased payouts for Covid-19 treatments &amp; deaths and... </p>
<p>Look. The bottom line is -- if anyone still claims to believe the response to Covid-19 was honest and righteous, they are either incredibly unintelligent OR supporting it for other reasons. (Maybe political reasons, maybe they built up a big personal identity around Covid-19 and it's hard to let it go, maybe they like working from home, or they like government paychecks for doing nothing, etc.)</p>
<p>The trolls we get who come here to advocate that agenda are disingenuous. It's becoming fatiguing to deal with them and I personally feel they should be banned from here even though I am normally against censorship.</p>
<p>But this is like the one safe space where intelligent people can communicate about what's actually happening, and the trolls bottom out conversations with needing the obvious explained to them.</p>

        <p>Oh! Sorry if I misunderstood.</p>
<p>Yeah it's a very strange thing... The degree to which it is being pushed. They <em>really</em> want us to take it.</p>
<p>We know it's not because they care about our health or lives because... come on. We live in the land of obesity and McDonalds is marketed to children even though we have an obesity crisis. And they closed gyms while making Taco Bell essential, etc... The idea that this is to help us in any way is clearly laughable.</p>
<p>So obviously it's money, profit, and power. Right!  Except... Why, then, would they release vaccines that have such potent side effects?  I've never seen so many people have strong reactions to a vaccine before. (And I'm referring to people I know in real life, not even counting the stuff online. And no, no one I know died from it (yet) but my father in law collapsed in his bathroom after he got home from the second shot. His wife found him on the floor when she got home, thought he was dead. And a girl that was in a deep lethargic funk for amount two weeks after getting it, like it just... took everything out of her. She's mostly normal, but man...)</p>
<p>So yeah. If it was just money they wouldn't have pushed something that has such strong reactions.</p>
<p>And there are other weird things, like the executive order that Trump signed in September of 2019 which paved the way for vaccines to be rushed -- and also the creation of the "Influenza Task Force" which brought together the heads of all the state departments unlike ever before. (Later known as Covid-19 Task Force.) Very suspicious.</p>
<p>There's no way I would ever take this vaccine, or let my kids. In fact -- the handling, the lies, the coercion --- everything about this has taken away any trust I had for any government or corporation.</p>
<p>I've always been a skeptical type, but the last year has made me incredibly skeptical.</p>
<p>In 2014, Harry Vox warned us that "facemasks and quarantines are coming" and...  he hit it right on the nose.</p>
<p>But there are so many things... </p>

<p>And this one, wow:</p>

<p>And here's the video of Harry Vox in 2014. The context is talking about 9/11 and ebola but he warns about --- where we are today.</p>

        <p><em>Right</em>. Because people who died after the vaccine were going to die anyway, unlike the people who got Covid-19 who were going to live eternally like vampires. /s</p>
<p>The double standard in the way deaths are counted for Covid-19 is one of the tell-tale signs of nefarious intent.</p>
<p>Add to that, the use of fear, propaganda, force, and censorship to further their agenda -- and they are effectively disqualified from any intellectual debate where reason or logic would prevail.</p>
<p>But... that's exactly <em>when</em> and <em>why</em> to use censorship and the silencing of dissent.</p>
<p>People spend so much time arguing over the specifics of this or that in regard to the Covid-19 debate --- but those two issues there are provable, and enough to invalidate their entire agenda.</p>
