    <strong>Just had a kid come uo to me, tried to give me his mask and then spit at me when i didn't take it</strong>
    <p><p>So of course I know that toddlers and kids don't really know what they are doing when they are younger. I mean this kid easily looked like he was under 5 years old. </p>
<p>Yet I was minding my own business at a shoe store and the kid comes up to me which is fine you know. I don't have a problem with kids or anyone for that matter so I still smiled just being a regular person. Then the kid actually holds out his mask to me like he wanted me to take it so I politely said "No thank you". The next thing surprised me was when he went up to me again and "tried" to spit. I say tried because well then they are that young they can't really launch their spit at you.</p>
<p>Actually to my surprise the parents were the ones apologizing to me and scolding their kid for doing that. So honestly while they were wearing masks they didn't seem to be one of those people to tell others to wear a mask. I'm honestly believing that kid got that kind of behavior from the school. Since if it was from the family the parents wouldn't have cared to apologize for that. </p>
<p>So I'm not even upset or angry at the kid for what they did. What concerns me is where they got that kind of behavior from. Since the parents seemed like really nice people for going out of their way to be apologetic and not even saying anything about me not having a mask I doubt it came from them. Yet it makes me scared that if schools are behind this type of behavior I can only imagine what the future generation will be like. Since they would actually be the ones who were RAISED during the "pandemic".</p></p>

        <p>Wow i was just talking about how impressionable kids are and how the face coverings would cause various life long issues.  Accessories as a societal measure of acceptance is tribal and in this case barbaric.</p>
<p>A princeton study showed that a smile is the most impactful social queue by a long shot.  So imagine a lifetime spent with a spiderman face over your mouth and adults telling you to demonize others without masks?</p>
