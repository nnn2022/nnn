    <strong>I’m so tired of people who make this out to be cute and funny</strong>
    <p><p>This has come up lately in discussions here and LDS, so why not? For months now, it seems like the virtue signalers have tried to make COVID forced house arrest be something we should all be enjoying. All the 2020 review videos of masked faces, working from home shots with pets and kids, empty vaccine vials on Christmas trees, all indicating that we should pretend we are happy with our current circumstances and they’re meant to be celebrated and commemorated. Or one of my favorites, a friend who posted a dance from her wedding with her husband. They did it in their garage since they were, you know, having their anniversary “in quarantine.” </p>
<p>I see it on my personal social media pages too. Everyone is desperate to post masked photos of themselves and show off how caring they are. My friends have waxed poetic about all the things they “get” to do (like bake bread and take Zoom tours of Disney World) and how they have thought positive or did “pandemic projects” or how their kid is “resilient.” Well yes, when you can buy your way to your child’s resiliency by affording the cheerleading squad, the hair highlights and the voice lessons, yeah of course you and your family are fine! What about families who are struggling and can’t afford those things? Do you tell them to just “change their mindset”? They make jokes about all the packages they order (that other people bring them while they sit on their fat ass) and how they don’t know what day it is. All of these people are well off with good incomes and can largely work at home. I have not seen them once acknowledge their privilege or even care about anyone who is hurting from continued restrictions. I have friends who, at Christmas, posted photos of cash they got and lavish gifts and bragged about the total of that cash. It’s all a game to them. Like your bragging wouldn’t be so obnoxious if you could at least show you appreciated your fortune and say you’re lucky you can do this but sympathize with the job losses or the forced poverty. But no, it’s all “look at me and how much fun we’re having!” </p>
<p>And yet we’re the ones expected to bow down and thank them for their sacrifice of doing absolutely nothing except sitting around in sweatpants. Go figure.</p></p>

<p>The people doing these things don't realize how cringe-worthy they are being.  They think everyone lives in two storey homes with plenty of space to "just relax" and "enjoy the down time".</p>
<p>They have no clue some people live in tiny apartments with little sunlight.</p>
<p>They seem not to care millions have lost their jobs, careers and industry.</p>
<p>Social Media has spoon fed everyone into believing Compliance is somehow a Virtue.  </p>
<p>If Social Media flipped the situation, for example if it came down to accepting Trump as President in 2016, it was "en vogue" to be "part of the resistance".</p>
<p>Now, it's not.</p>
<p>Now, it's en vogue to show everyone just how hard you can comply.  </p>
<p>We're being manipulated.  Most people aren't aware of this.  They are too busy collecting virtue points.</p>

        <p>What made me scream inside is when I saw a meme of a fashionable man with nice clothes and sunglasses walking with a caption like "us if we got the $2000 stimulus." Like... ah ha ha... 50 million people food insecure, but lockdown would be fine if you could buy yourself a nice bag.</p>
