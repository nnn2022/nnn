        <p>The official excuse will be to blame those bad non-compliant citizens. The great unwashed masses of ignorant science-deniers. More restrictions will be required.</p>

        <p>You can't reason with doomers. Point out Argentina (or Chile, or California, or Israel, take your pick) has had restrictions and/or masks for months and and cases have only increased, and they say</p>
<p>&rt; Well that's because no one is complaint!</p>
<p>Point out Sweden has had no restrictions and cases have been going down since April without spiking back up (unlike, say France or Spain), they say:</p>
<p>&rt; Well that's because they were all social distancing and wearing masks anyway!</p>
<p>I asked someone on another sub to explain how the rise in cases (which is only a couple percentage points) in NYC Hasidic neighborhoods could be tied to them not social distancing and wearing masks if that spike is recent and they've been eschewing the public health guidelines since April, and they told me there were other factors. "Other factors" which lead to a rise in cases, but only if you're not wearing masks or social distancing? They made absolutely no sense. These people are beyond reason.</p>

        <p>when they use a manufacturing technique as a 'test' and crank up the 'cycles' of the technique, what do they expect? they expect what they got, that's why they did it that way.</p>
<p>16,447 new 'cases'? how many have symptoms? how many are hospitalized? how many died with it directly?  how old were they? how many underlying conditions did they have?</p>

        <p>You're exactly right.  The number is actually: PCR positive results.</p>
<p>We don't know if RNA was present but no infection was present (and there's several different ways that can go down from virions being present but not yet or never infected to a cleared infection with viral debris found), and we don't know if the same individuals are counted again and again as multiple "cases" with re-tests, and anybody that's not admitted to a hospital for treatment and does recover is pointless for everybody to know about (except to incite fear??)</p>
<p>Who'd even want to <em>bother</em> imagining if everyday everybody heard about everybody around the world that caught a cold and had the sniffles?!  What a clown world.</p>
<p>The virus was beyond "control" (at least in USA, idk about Argentina) at least by March, and possibly as early as January.</p>
<p>Everybody needs to not let fear of it control their life and learn to live with it.</p>
