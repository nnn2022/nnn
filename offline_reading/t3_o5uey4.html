    <strong>I've never worked in a hermetically sealed IT department</strong>
    <p><p>So CNN posts this <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/22/us/florida-manatee-county-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html">jewel</a>. Looks as though eight people in a government building contracted covid. Looks like a pretty big building. Probably holds a few hundred people, but apparently only nine people work there, as the article only mentioned nine people, included the hero who got a FDA-unapproved vaccine. No mention of a few hundred people unaffected by the "deadly variant". Wondering who paid CNN to post this sloppy excuse for journalism. Perhaps the headline should read, "Please please please get a dose of our product, CEO wants a jacuzzi added to his pool"</p></p>
