    <strong>Have any of you read the book “From Dictatorship to Democracy” by Gene Sharp?</strong>
    <p><p>Reading it right now. Really good book that might be able to help us get out of this mess, so long as we can get the majority of the population openly on our side.</p>
<p>If you have read it, let me know what you think of it.</p>
<p>Link to purchase (I know it’s amazon but I don’t wanna get struck): https://www.amazon.ca/Dictatorship-Democracy-Conceptual-Framework-Liberation/dp/1595588507</p></p>

<p>The mainstream media is hiding major news events like the Barrington declaration and the signed letter from Belgian doctors. Google can manipulate search results and kick off people from YouTube. All the algorithms want the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yeah but on street level nobody wants this shit. I see people all the time with their masks on their chin... they repeatedly take it on and off. There are secret parties everywhere. Most people dgaf anymore... it’s like what some of my teachers who grew up in the former Soviet Union used to tell me about that place: “you read the newspapers and do the marches and the salutes, but nobody actually believes that. You do it to keep up appearances.”</p>
<p>At least from what I’m seeing, most people don’t believe the script anymore. They virtue signal on social media but on the DL they’re gathering with huge groups of friends undistanced &amp; unmasked. It’s like what marshawn lynch said: “I’m just doing it so I won’t get fined.”</p>
<p>People may not read the Barrington declaration, but they sure as shit see on the news when people in high places politically go unmasked, unrestricted, &amp; undistanced while the rest of us suffer through their restrictions (in my province, our Premier was caught at a wedding with 150 people unmasked &amp; undistanced). Capitalize on that, or whatever the local version of that is, so it hits closer to home.</p>
<p>Most people think like us or can be easily re-programmed to do so. We just need to embolden them.</p>

        <p>Have noticed the signatures from public on GB Declaration got to half million mark and seem to have slowed over last week or so.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is because it's being effectively censored (half a million is TINY in a global context), people are afraid to sign their name to it, or whether less people agree with it than some of us would hope?  Afterall some polls are showing support for hard or even harder lockdowns in many places.</p>
<p>Has me a bit worried.  A few hundred million signatures on there would seem to be what's really needed to give it any meaningful traction as a measure of the opinion of the masses?</p>
<p>Is half a million as far as it will get?  I really have no idea.</p>

        <p>That’s good for most online petitions. Remember: polls often lie to suit the narrative. That goes for any side of an argument. People often lie in polls as well: they don’t want to show their true opinions for fear of being doxxed/harassed/cancelled over them.</p>
<p>This means my point still stands: we just need to embolden people.</p>
