        <p>I totally agree that medical procedures should be personal choices. </p>
<p>That said this is what happens when you boil complex issues like abortion down to catchy “slogans”.  You end up with a statement that you might not fully stand by when it comes to other issues and now put yourself in a tricky situation where now you have to defend why you think it’s alright to force someone else to do something to their body that they don’t agree with.</p>

        <p>As someone who socializes with people on the left and on the right, I don’t think the overlap of people who think you should be obligated by law to have a vaccine and the people who are pro choice have as much overlap as you’re implying. Yes a lot of shaming against being anti-covid vax is going on right now, but you’re not legally obligated to get the vaccine the way many women are legally obligated to carry out a pregnancy, that’s the difference.</p>

        <p>I’m talking about the government. If your workplace has policies you don’t like, it sucks, but you can try to find work elsewhere. If abortion becomes illegal everywhere, there’s no options for you other than leaving your home country which I’m pretty sure is significantly different from having to find a new job.</p>

        <p>Well I guess it depends on how many companies get encouraged to implement the rule.</p>
<p>And for your point there is the option of not getting pregnant. And many pretty reliable ways to go about that option too, and one guaranteed way.</p>

        <p>I don’t think staying a virgin forever is optimal, and having your tubes tied is a risky procedure. Vasectomies can fail. Birth control can fail. Rape happens. In some cases, even a wanted child could be diagnosed in the womb with medical issues that would make it cruel to carry to term.</p>
<p>Aside from that argument, my point was that for now the vaccine is not mandated by law, and I don’t see any strong pushes for that to be the case, especially in states like Florida where there is active pushes against that. Abortion however is on the frontlines for being made illegal. I just thought your argument wasn’t even keeled, and was pretty insulting to those of us that are pro choice but also believe in people having a choice of whether or not to get the vaccine. I’m tired of pro choice being looked at as loving to murder babies. </p>
<p>Most people who are pro choice don’t want abortion to be in the top 10 list of choice for ‘birth control’, but see the reasons where a difficult decision might need to be made.</p>

        <p>Ok listen. I never once mentioned murdering babies. I was never rude in any manner so if you got insulted by my above statement grow a pair cus I do not care if you were insulted by simple facts. Yes birth control can fail. If you use two forms the odds are very low that will occur. Yes rape occurs, also rare. In the end in most cases, not discounting the rare ones, I suspect that it is very often bad decision making that results in pregnancy. People can’t take their pills on time. People don’t bother to begin with. Looks like from what I am reading below 50% say they were using protection the month of the abortion. That still accounts for a couple of hundred thousand abortions that are pure negligence. From data I have seen like 68% are for elective reasons, 13% economic, less than 1% rape.</p>
<p>That all said I am not sure it should be illegal. I certainly would think negatively of someone who made that choice personally if it was simply because they are irresponsible, however I prefer less government in general. Abortions for medical conditions should always be allowed, as well as for rape. Late term terminations should not be allowed, again unless it’s a medical condition. But knowing that many times it’s bad decision making and knowing that there is an abundance of people out there willing to adopt a healthy newborn....it’s pretty difficult to not see that side of the table.</p>

        <p>Okay, the phrase ‘slaughtering their unborn children’ has the same connotation as murder, and I have not been rude to you either. I’m just stating that it is obviously insulting to insinuate that women who are faced with that decision are slaughtering their babies. </p>
<p>I also agree with you that late term abortion should not happen in cases other than extreme medical conditions. I also agree that it shouldn’t be used in cases where a mother could raise a healthy and well cared for child. That said, not every newborn is adopted and of those I’ve met who have been through the adoption center, they’ve all said the system is extremely broken.</p>
<p>I do understand your points, I was just saying that I don’t think being insulted by what is clearly meant to be an insult to those that make that decision makes me overly sensitive, especially since I thought we were having a polite debate. I was just saying that I think to put down a whole group of people who likely agree with you that the vaccine should be a choice isn’t helpful to anyone. It’s hard to get people to agree with you when you’re actively making their decisions sound bad because they’ll go into a place of defense rather than being in a mindset to listen.</p>
