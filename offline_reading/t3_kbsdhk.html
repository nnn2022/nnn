        <p>C'mon guys trust the experts:</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://decaturish.com/2020/12/dear-decaturish-city-schools-of-decatur-should-offer-in-person-learning-option-for-all-students/">"We are a group of public health and medical professionals writing to express <strong>our concerns about the narrow use and misrepresentation of science</strong> in justifying the elimination of 6th-12th grade students from an option to return to in-person learning in the City Schools of Decatur.  We believe CSD’s decision to maintain virtual learning for 6th-12th grades is based on a misread of the available evidence on school-based transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It also takes a narrow view that fails to account for the science related to student mental health and the protections that come from students’ connection to school, as well as evidence that prolonged virtual learning is having an adverse impact on students in the US. As a result this decision has the potential to further needlessly and irrevocably damage the mental health and academic success of CSD students."</a></p>
