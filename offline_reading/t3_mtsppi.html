<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56771766.amp">How India fAilEd to pReVeNt a natural Virus from spreading</a></p>
<p>How all of a sudden is this happening? We all know the waves, deadly variants are all different marketing techniques for the pandemic. We know the average death age is around 80. We know masks don't work... </p>
<p>And yet in the past few days, the amount of fear being spread on all Indian social media is way out of control. There's this new "Double mutant" variant and pictures just show people dying left and right. No place to bury them, so bodies being dumped, hospitals filled, no doctors. And ofc the gen Z and millenials and almost everyone on social media latch onto their most desired way to solve everything- Wear a fucking mask and stay away from others. No symptoms but stay away from others eh? What bullshit is this, a year after? And now other countries want to put India on their Red list. There are already news articles saying that the variant has reached England and that this variant is particularly dangerous for young healthy people.</p>
<p>And yesterday India recorded 250k cases, 1500 deaths with 1.3m active cases. So what 1500 deaths? 2500 children die of starvation everyday anyways and they've been dying since years - did these "heroes" stop eating food to prevent that? Death rate in India is 7.23 per thousand people, a quick calculation gives us 27000, subtracting the children deaths give us 25000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DYING EVERYDAY IN INDIA SINCE YEARS. Fucking numb skulls on social media comparing it to Black Death and the Plague, get some facts before destroying our society!!! I'm losing my college, my brother is losing his school years and 280 MILLION OTHER STUDENTS IN INDIA. HOW ARE THEY GONNA GET THEIR EDUCATION??</p>
<p>I get the hospital system is collapsing but that's what would happen in a country of 1.3 billion people and I don't even know the condition of hospitals before this, couldn't have been much better, could it? Hardly 2% of the population is vaccinated and it'd take years vaccinating the rest of the country. We don't know anything about what happened in China which is the only other country with such huge population. Then the US where the media is the virus but no hospitals collapsed and then Brazil and Pakistan have been doing okay. </p>
<p>WHEN WOULD THIS END? HOW IS LIVING IN FEAR BETTER THAN LIVING YOUR LIFE? </p>
<p>Also, what's the agenda at play there in India? Because election rallies with thousands are still happening, religious festivals with hundreds of thousands of people are being celebrated but at the same time the fearmongering is at an all time high and children are losing their brains because they're forced to stay at home and masks, fucking masks are everywhere. It's very possible it is to make people get vaccines because India too is ready to have digital identities of its citizens, the face recognition systems are being put in place and the laws are all set to come into force.</p>
<p>Seems to me it's the global agenda, reset, whatever. </p>
<p>We're living in unprecedented times. I've always been the most rational person but now any dumb ass or most smart people for that matter would just call me a conspiracy theorist and move on to watch the news lmao.</p></p>
