    <strong>Nelson Rockefeller Quotes</strong>
    <p><p>This guy was unbelievably transparent at constantly giving up the Rockefeller agenda.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"The secret to success is to own nothing, but control everything."</p>
<p>"The nation-state is becoming less and less competent to perform its international political tasks... These are some of the reasons pressing us to lead vigorously toward the true building of a new world order."</p>
<p>"As President, I would work toward international creation of a new world order."</p>
<p>"I am a great believer in planning- economic, social, political, military, total world planning."</p>
<p>"The United Nations, 'has not been able-nor can it be able-to shape a new world order which events so compellingly demand.' ... The new world order that will answer economic, military, and political problems, he said, 'urgently requires, I believe, that the United States take the leadership among all free peoples to make the underlying concepts and aspirations of national sovereignty truly meaningful through the federal approach.'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This guy was literally a heartbeat away from the US presidency. Let that sink in.</p></p>

        <p>I can barely imagine what Nelson would have done in NY state during the 1968 flu if that flu had actually managed to make the national news like COVID did.</p>
<p>I'm sure he would have forced everybody in NY state to take the vaccine his family produced, and jailed anybody who refused.</p>

        <p>“<strong>BOBO ROCKEFELLER EXPOSED PLAN TO USURP PRESIDENCY WITHOUT ELECTION</strong></p>
<p>In 1968, Dr. Emanuel Josephson wrote of a plot to put Nelson Rockefeller in the White House.  </p>
<p>Sure enough, Nelson wound up as an unelected Vice President to unelected Warren Commission stooge, President Gerald Ford.</p>
<p>President Ford survived two assassination attempts in September 1975 and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1975/10/15/archives/ford-is-uninjured-as-his-car-is-hit-in-hartford-sedan-driven-by-a.html">car “accident” in October.</a> Lol.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Josephson prophetically writes:</strong></p>
<p>“The conspirators’ purpose in imposing the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">XXVth amendment</a> on the nation was disclosed by divorce-bent <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/miners-daughter-wound-up-a-rockefeller-got-big-divorce-settlement/">Bobo Rockefeller,</a> wife of the “homophile” <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winthrop_Rockefeller">Winthrop,</a> who <strong>reported that she had overheard the discussion by the brothers, at one of their Sunday weekly conferences, of a plan to seize the Presidency for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/nyregion/31rocky.html">Nelson</a> </strong>without an election,<strong> presumably by the devices with which he had become familiar in the process of exploiting South American lands as “Coordinator.”
The exposure so thoroughly alarmed the Rockefellers that their attorneys, who had previously fought bitterly Bobo’s divorce action with every device at their command, and were prepared to threaten to take action against her that would deny her the custody of her child, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winthrop_Paul_Rockefeller">Winthrop Rockefeller, Jr.,</a> hastened to offer her all her demands - on one condition, directly after her interview appeared in the magazine section of a New York newspaper.  </strong>The condition is reported to have been a pledge that she would never again any of the Rockefeller’s schemes, plans, plots or private business that she might have overheard.** The divorce agreement is also reported to provide that if Bobo ever again opens her mouth with regard to Rockefeller affairs, the few millions, that for them is an insignificant sum, that she was given, would revert to them.”

        <p>Bunch of dirty nazis </p>
<p>“Beginning in 1930, the Rockefeller Foundation provided financial support to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics,[25] which later inspired and conducted eugenics experiments in the Third Reich.</p>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation funded Nazi racial studies even after it was clear that this research was being used to rationalize the demonizing of Jews and other groups. Up until 1939, the Rockefeller Foundation was funding research used to support Nazi racial science studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics (KWIA.) Reports submitted to Rockefeller did not hide what these studies were being used to justify. Still, Rockefeller continued the funding and refrained from criticizing this research so closely derived from Nazi ideology. The Rockefeller Foundation did not alert "the world to the nature of German science and the racist folly" that German anthropology promulgated. Rockefeller funded for years after the passage of the 1935 Nuremberg racial laws.[26]</p>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation, along with the Carnegie Institution, was the primary financier for the Eugenics Record Office, until 1939.”</p>
