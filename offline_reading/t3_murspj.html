    <strong>In the past six months I’ve taken several trips to states that have no mask mandates. Here’s what I saw.</strong>
    <p><p>Florida, Daytona/Port Orange area (November 2020 and December 2020)</p>
<p>&rt;Virtually no masks to be seen in any public space</p>
<p>&rt;Many chain businesses had signs asking you to mask up, which had maybe 25% compliance or less</p>
<p>&rt;Old people couldn’t have given less of a shit</p>
<p>&rt;The only businesses we wore masks in were Total Wine &amp; More, and CVS</p>
<p>&rt;Most local bars and restaurants had removed mask-related signage, employees still mostly complied</p>
<p>Texas, Dallas/FTW area (December 2020 and April 2021)</p>
<p>&rt;during the late December trip mask compliance was token at best. Limited to chains and wearing masks briefly before being seated at restaurants.</p>
<p>&rt;By April it was a similar story to Florida</p>
<p>&rt;All bars and restaurants had virtually zero mask compliance</p>
<p>&rt;Larger chains had signs asking for masks, less than 50% compliance, most employees wore masks</p>
<p>Couple of interesting things to note here.</p>
<p>Bars and restaurants in both areas had a conspicuous absence of mask related signage, and most of the places in Dallas/FTW that we went to that had mask signs in December had removed them by April. I took it as the free market at work - people were avoiding establishments that required masks in favor of ones that didn’t, until almost all of them had removed the requirement as a matter of necessity. One restaurant in particular had masks required in December but in April the mask sign had changed to a sign explaining why some employees were still wearing masks while customers weren’t required.</p>
<p>The latest trip to Texas confirmed my theory regarding chains still requiring masks even in areas without a mandate - its because they’re large elephants with standardized impersonal corporate policy designed for minimizing liability. The small chains are where things get interesting.</p>
<p>There’s a regional chain of gas stations called QuikTrip (like the Midwest version of WaWa) that has a footprint in both Texas and my home state. The mask signage at stations in my area always struck me as interesting, worded like “due to county ordinance, we require all customers to wear face coverings” or some such. At the stations in Texas ALL mask signage is gone, and no one (not even employees) are wearing masks. There was a similar shift at locations of a regional fast food place (Braums) that has stores in both Oklahoma and Texas.</p></p>

        <p>It is past time to ban masking. Period. It has been proven by states with harsh mask mandates actually having MORE cases of severe CoVid infections that the masks actually make things worse in the real world.</p>

        <p>...look why do you have to lie? They don’t have an effect, they don’t make things worse though? </p>
<p>This is just as bad as saying they help significantly, because it’s just a lie</p>
<p>Why are you pushing lies just like those people who push masks?</p>

        <p>My question with all of these is how do we find out which places are open without restrictions without literally calling or walking up to the door?  Most don't seem to have updated their websites, and I'm not finding much on places like tripadvisor/yelp.</p>
<p>I just want to take my family to dinner across the border in NH but I loathe the idea of calling place after place and (presumably?) being told they all still require masks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, doing so will at least tell them they're losing my business.  Ugh.</p>
<p>update: 0 for 6 in the dover/portsmouth area so far, all (apparently?) independent restaurants.  maybe they would let us in despite their advertised policy, but it's a 45min drive with my family/kids and i'm not counting on it.</p>

        <p>NH resident here. From what I have seen, nobody has lifted their mask requirements even though the Governor lifted the mandate. It sucks, but the scars of this bullshit run deep, and it may take awhile for people to feel comfortable being human again.</p>

        <p>We should start a “no new normal” app that directs people to places without restrictions. It would prob have to be a paid app to keep it private. </p>

        <p>If I was on the phone I would tell you the store requires it per state regs, but in person I would prefer if you didn't wear it unless you absolutely wanted to. I'm probably going to get in trouble soon but at this point I really can't put the mask back on.</p>

        <p>For NH state regs no longer require it, so they aren't trying to appease the authorities, just what they think their customers want to hear, or their own virtue signaling, so lying seems a little less likely.  I need to find locals on the ground who can find the right places and report back!</p>

        <p>Last year (in fl) i did go out of my way every single day to either call the business I needed to go in and ask if they required masks (if they did I did not go in) or just simply walk in without it and as soon as I got yelled at I would say "okay, you won't get my business then" and walk right back out. It was worth it to me, and worked out fine for me. Everyone around me would be like "just do it, just do what they say you're being ridiculous." Maybe I am ridiculous, but I'd rather be rebellious, ridiculous, and free, than a sheep.</p>

        <p>I do believe the principle of the thing is important, for myself and my family. I believe its vital to fight this and to be seen fighting it, for all those who need more encouragement to be able to resist. It may not be enough, but it's better than handing over our rights to tyrants.</p>

<p>-Mandate was lifted on the 1st</p>
<p>-Covid signs on almost every business came down</p>
<p>-Mask use is at about 25%</p>
<p>-No businesses resist maskless customers</p>
<p>Cannot speak for the NW area. College football is huge in this state, and the Razorbacks home is Fayetteville (NW area). This means interstate mingling. Since the governor put the ball in the county's court, the local government will probably try and play nice with the narrative.</p>

        <p>Also the closer you are to a blue area, the more likely even small businesses will comply. In Travis County, TX, even outside the Austin city limits you still have plenty of mask signs. They don't start disappearing until you get a county or two away.</p>

        <p>South Carolina:</p>
<p>Myrtle Beach:</p>
<p>Around 40 to 60 percent of people wear masks. Most of them are noticeably wealthy (expensive handbags, clothing, etc) Masking is less common in touristy areas with less than 10% of people wearing masks, even in crowded bars, restaurants, and piers.</p>
<p>Florence:</p>
<p>Masks required on school grounds, less than 50% compliance. Masks required while playing sports, less than 10% compliance. When we talk about masks there is a general air that they are pretty useless. I play soccer with the same group of 20 kids every day, and twice weekly we play against another team of 20 or so kids. No masks. Plenty of bodily contact. Not a single sickness yet this year, much less covid. Only people I know of who have gotten sick I heard about through online classes, and none of them had covid.</p>
<p>I feel like in rural areas, covid is a non issue. Then again, I've not been in a extremely densely populated area in a few years. The biggest city I have been to is myrtle beach.</p>

        <p>I hate that places are still making their employees wear them. Why would you want the appearance of your employees being sick and dirty and have to cover their faces to serve you? Without the mandate I have hatred for businesses that do this to the people who work for them.</p>
