    <strong>What's the situation like outside North-America and Australia?</strong>
    <p><p>What is happening now where you're/your friends are at and what do you think will happen in the next few weeks (getting worse, better or staying where it is now)?</p>
<p>I haven't heard much about Africa at all for months now, that would be interesting, Asia is off the radar too.</p></p>

        <p>I’m Congolese and the government is more concerned with Ebola (as they should be) than corona. It’s dying off. Probably because most cases are extremely mild and nobody from what I understand cares for mild cases. </p>
<p>People can’t really afford to stop living and working  in the DRC anyways</p>

        <p>I don’t live there lol. I was born there. </p>
<p>I don’t think so from what I hear. I think they were at the beginning but not anymore. Of course that depends on what part your from. I doubt the extremely poor people were doing any of that.</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK. It's an omnishambles.</p>
<p>The lockdown keeps going on and off on an almost daily basis now. I've lost track of when it starts and ends so I just assume it's permanently on. Then they have local lockdowns and national lockdowns which makes it even more confusing. They only do local lockdowns in areas that have rising "cases", but also when deaths rise. Although, they did lock down a city of 700,000 because about 12 people died over the course of a week so it's not exactly sensible.</p>
<p>The masks... they're semi-mandatory. Legally you can claim exemption from wearing one with little to no evidence required, but that still doesn't stop shops from refusing entry - or the psychopathic mask fetishists from attacking you. Otherwise it is heavily recommended in shops but I don't think they are required for just being outside (at least, not yet).</p>
<p>Social distancing also exists pretty much everywhere i think.</p>
<p>The thing is, even though death rates have slowed to a pathetic crawl, the prevention measures haven't eased. If anything they seem to have increased. The government seems drunk with power and have this insane idea they can actually eradicate the virus entirely. No longer are they simply trying to "flatten the curve", they seem to be actually trying to eliminate it from existence. Of course that's infeasible, which is why it's all so insane.</p>
<p>Yes, there are a lot of infections, oh sorry, "cases", and apparently this number is rising (shows how effective all those precautions are, right?) but the biggest symptom of covid appears to be feeling totally fine. You need to have a test to know you are "ill". And as I said above, death rates how dropped to next to nothing.</p>
<p>It's madness. Covid is obviously a nothingburger yet the government is eagerly wrecking society and the economy in this ridiculous crusade to remove it from existence. The UK economy was already on shakey ground before covid, but after the lockdowns it's been pulverised into a quivering mess.</p>
<p>I am scared of how the next few years will play out. Not because of covid, but because of the imbeciles trying to make covid vanish.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your extensive report.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;but the biggest symptom of covid appears to be feeling totally fine.<br>
&rt;<br>

<p>Well if there is no pandemic they have to make it up somehow.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I think you meant <strong>a</strong>social distancing. But sad to read.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;and apparently this number is rising (shows how effective all those precautions are, right?)</p>
<p>Nah it means obviously that we need waaaaay more restrictions on everyone. If the case-number on the television-screen isn't claimed to be raising then the restrictions are working. - Double-bind, they always need to stay or have to be increased according to them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;No longer are they simply trying to "flatten the curve", they seem to be  actually trying to eliminate it from existence. Of course that's  infeasible, which is why it's all so insane.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't really get this perspective. The people who want to rule over you and want to boss you around to the most ridiculous aspects of your life are obviously not your friends. Especially not if they also are proven liars. So why believe in good intentions on their part when all of this makes much more sense if you simply see it as a veil to force worse forms of fascism on the whole world.</p>

<p>Well I'm scared too, but not because of the beerus or of incompetence (I don't think there is any, just malice) but severe fascism. To me it looks like we are only a few months away from concentration camps (maybe called "infection centers" or "health centers"), though I really hope I'm wrong.</p>

<p>What exactly does that mean on a practical level, can you leave your house for other things than groceries f.e.?</p>

        <p>Living in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Everything went back to semi normal on July 1st. Shops and restaurants were all open. Just needed to sign a name and number for tracing of anyone got it that was in there.
Streets were designated one way for walking which nobody paid attention too. 
1.5m distancing was also ignored. 
A few shops got plastic dividers for the staff and limited numbers in store at one time. </p>
<p>Last week we've gone to a "semi lockdown" where everywhere has to be closed by 10pm. Masks in certain shops at the shops discretion. Borders seem to be locking down with belguim and Germany now too with more strict measures to be announced on Monday. Full lockdown is expected again and I'm not looking forward are to it. Last three days the corona tally has been 4000-5000-6000. The death tolls haven't been mentioned in awhile so I presume they are pretty low. Fines of 395euro have been in place since the start but rarely handed out. Lowered this recently to 95 so that gives the impression they may hand them out alot more now </p>
<p>Worst part of it all  personally has been working from home. I work for a large call centre so just have angry people venting their frustrations at me in my own home all day with no break as people seem to call more because they have nothing else to do/outlet to vent</p>

<p>Oh man, I can completely imagining how awful that is, though call-center jobs weren't really known to be pleasurable even before all this, but I can totally see that it is even worse now.</p>
