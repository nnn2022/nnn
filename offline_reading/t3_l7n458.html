    <strong>BF had ''pub quiz'' last night... realized too late that it was online. I had an online bingo. I fucking hate the online nonsense</strong>
    <p><p>My bf had a ''pub quiz'' last night as he told me over Telegram. I was busy and doing other stuff so I subconsciously assumed that I'd be eating alone that day, and that he was eating fries and drinking beers with his colleagues somewhere in a bar. When I came home, I realized that he was home in front of the computer... and I was like ''oh God of course, how could I forget''. </p>
<p>Where I live there's a hard lockdown, all shops except the most essential are closed, there's a curfew, etc. So, we couldn't do much to celebrate Christmas or the new year at work... so we did a sad online bingo for pity's sake. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if the online ''''''fun''''''' depresses me even more than nothing at all. I hate video calling to begin with..... I don't ''feel'' the person's presence, especially when there're a lot of people in a conversation, I just zone out as it feels like this is not a live conversation but just an incredibly boring YT vid that I'm not allowed to switch off. IRL I'm talkative enough, and then I ''feel'' the actual presence of people, but this is just ironically so disconnected, and boring, and tiring.</p>
<p>Long meetings have me in a slight agony. I get even more annoyed when people talk about the non-essential stuff like their mom's best friend's hospital visit, and stuff like that, as I just want it to be over. </p>
<p>I HATE it. My work wants to offer more stuff online by video calling and I dread the idea as I just loathe it. My education now has 100% online classes (for now) as I'm in a form of education for adults and I just HAVE to switch off my camera (to the dismay of teachers) because I need to do something else while listening to the class. </p>
<p>I hate it. I hate the ''fun'' online substitutes of actual IRL activities. It just rubs it in. I hate how draining and boring it is. I just want to shut the damn thing off and do something more meaningful. These activities really don't make me feel connected or as though I'm actually doing something with my team. It's sad, pathetic crap and I don't get how so many people are willing to tolerate this bullshit for God knows how many years.</p></p>

        <p>I have been able to opt out of all types of social activity alternatives such as Zoom meetings.
Maybe, that makes me a jerk but I just hope it brings us all closer to the real thing in a small way.</p>

        <p>You are not alone. I am both working and going to school predominantly online. Live online lectures and staff meetings have a special place in hell. My camera is now 99.5% off. I don’t care about the repercussions anymore. I feel like I’m being forced to hear ridiculous butt kissing small talk ... you hit the nail on the head. I have started to get my laundry done during all of these crappy meetings.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Someone telling me that "hanging out with your friends over zoom" is the same thing as hanging out in person, is delusional.</p>
<p>I've also been able to avoid zoom most of the time, and the one time I had to participate for work, I was checked out in 3 minutes (3 hour meeting). Never turned on my camera of microphone, and I was playing games the whole time.</p>
