<p>The pic above is from a 90s meme religion / edgy art project called the Church of Euthanasia. I was reminded of it by the crazy juxtoposition of what these modern would-be saviors claim is important, vs. how they go about accomplishing it. Not just with the shutdowns, but with Climate Change, scorched earth 2-party politics, etc.</p>
<p>These people want to SAVE LIVES and SAVE THE PLANET, and most importantly SAVE GRANDMAS, but of course doing those things require a whole lot of human casualties and collateral damage. If you've been around the block on reddit, certainly you've seen their comments urging us to kill ourselves outright, or speedily die of the virus (which should be a lot easier than it is, if it's so deadly, and we're so obtuse ... right?)</p>
<p>These same people, up until March, claimed that mental health was TERRIBLY important. But now they fully support the most extreme mass mental health experiment ever undertaken - utterly without consent for a large percentage of the population, which was also previously claimed to be important. Sure, it's unfortunate that a lot of people will ultimately kill themselves or lose their marbles, but it's for multiple good causes. Just think of the improved carbon footprint! And all the pro-masker lives that will be saved - many of whom have not, and will never, reproduce because of dreaded Climate Change, or maybe because they are already parents of <em>heckin' cute puppers</em>. In fact, just today there was an angry anti-natalist skulking about this subreddit, criticizing all who would dare reproduce in this 'fascist slave system' (paraphrasing, but close)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChurchOfCOVID/">Church of COVID</a> is only a meme religion thus far, but with time and effort I think it's well on its way to becoming the real deal. Instead of "God bless you" people will say "I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU!" (or if they can feel the Holy Corona Ghost in their very blood, maybe even "BITCH, KILL YOURSELF!")</p>
