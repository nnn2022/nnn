    <strong>How do you cope with the feeling of despair ?</strong>
    <p><p>5 years ago I started researching what’s really going on in the world behind the scenes and although It felt like my life was a lie I still felt like I had free will </p>
<p>Now however is a different story, everything I read about from Bolshevism, mass media brainwashing, social engineering and cultural Marxism has now become so apparent to the point it’s inescapable, it feels like most people have become NPC’s that don’t question anything </p>
<p>I’m an athlete and make a living off competing which has essentially come to a halt since all of this started and it just feels like our lives are being dictated by corrupt politicians only trying extend their own greed. 
I’ve come off of social media and try my best to avoid the MSM news outlets but I can’t shake this feeling of despair.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone on this sub it’s given me a lot of hope over the past few months</p></p>

        <p>Are you getting your nature in? That’s been my saviour this last 10 months. Just ditching tech and walking around the woods and fields, whacking stuff with sticks/climbing trees or wtv. Really recharges after long internet doom n gloom sessions.</p>
<p>Even if you live in city.. just breaking from the damn internet for a few hrs a day.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. It is so unfair and so hard at the same time. Your spirit and soul know there is more to life than what you're being told. I think about individuals like you who have had their whole existence turned upside down - all the ways you gain meaning from the world are up in the air.  You will continue to learn and grow in truth and it will be hard. However, I know that hope is the only thing that springs eternal.  </p>
<p>Their control stops when we stop letting them have it.  You can help get out of the despair by focusing on making change that you have control over. Tell people the truth. Tell them what is happening at a speed with which they can take it. You can continue to learn and grow. Join a group of likeminded truth seekers in your area. Send research about the truth of what is happening and the research on the health and safety to the folks who run your athletic competitions so they have  solid legs to stand on for getting the sport back to normal again. </p>
<p>Chin up. You're not alone.</p>

        <p>It's hard. I feel very alone and don't know what I would do without my mother and sister who are also open-minded and see what is really at play here. I would find local groups who have like-minded views. a local meditation group would feed two birds with one hand for you- the mental health and also they see the world as it could be and are usually more understanding that we are five dimensional beings in a three-dimensional world. A local human rights advocacy group? I found  some truth seekers I follow online and many of the people who follow them as well, I have found community in.  Here are some of their accounts you can follow.  I check out what they have to say for inspiration and learning.  I am encouraged and inspired when I read their posts and listen to their messages.

        <p>I'm in denial about it. Not gonna lie. I keep thinking one day I will wake up and things will be better. I'm in the US, so I can do that easier. I didn't lose my income, so also easier. I wasn't especially outgoing, but I did enjoy traveling solo. Leaving my state is a hassle and masks and security theater make exploring nearby cities a total buzzkill. I avoid reminders as much as possible. Pay extra to avoid commercials. Turn the radio station and delete the channel if it's too much covid.</p>
<p>I got really worked up in April and May trying to figure everything out. It took me more months to calm down, but I did eventually. I got myself into a nightly workout routine (at home-never enjoyed the gym) and cut out weeknight drinking (that started in March). My weekend drinking has really slowed down now thankfully. I found a healthy (food related) at home hobby. I found this sub and CCJ. I stopped reading any news articles. Never watched that shit. When it warms up, I will get out a lot more. I work all day, five days a week, so I actually enjoy staying home all weekend, but I will still try. I'm just waiting and waiting and hoping. I don't want this to ruin my mental health so I am fighting it the best that I can. I'm heading back to FL when I can, but that's quite a few years off. It still filled me hope and purpose. Patience, I guess. </p>
<p>I feel for you. I do. I really enjoy interacting with you all. I hope things get better. I just keep waiting.</p>

        <p>The nightly workout routine is something I’m definitely going to start doing that’s a perfect idea, it’s insane how quickly this change has come about, feels like it was just yesterday everything was back to normal</p>

        <p>All the stress, drinking, and eating before bed caused me to gain about 20 lbs and at my age it is so much harder to get off. But it's slowly happening now that I dedicated myself to stop all of that and never skip a night of exercise. The biggest change for me mentally was finally getting a haircut. My hair was so damaged from missing regular trims (thick, wavy hair) that I had to cut a lot of it off. </p>
<p>This morning some radio guy said "NOW that the pandemic is over, uh, I mean WHEN" and that was a change from the norm. Small steps I guess.</p>

        <p>I have come to the point that I feel like I understand why this blatant disregard for human well being is necessary in the longer term. This event has made more people then I could ever imagine realize how corrupt our current systems are including me. I know for me I feel like I am insane some days when I see how programmed the general population is but when I'm able to talk about the blatant corruption it lifts my spirits surprisingly. It's like I finally have a reason to want to be a "good guy" because now I know who the "bad guy" is. It's more complicated than that but the way we fight this is by living as strong individuals. Knowledge is power and a whole lot of knowledge is being learned right now by a lot of people. We got this. This is the hard times but we fight through the hard times so we can enjoy the good times all the more. Also I say fight but never with violence that never leads anywhere useful history tells that story repeatedly.</p>

        <p>My life was just work-to-home-to-work-to-home even before this hoax. Didn't change much. Except the concerts I'd attend as a break from my mundane life have been taken away from me. So that's a bother. I haven't been in a mosh pit since December 2019.</p>
<p>I try to avoid all propaganda I can. Only keep a couple social media sites to know what they're planning to enforce next, and making sure I don't get doxxed by some Karen for lowering the muzzle to get a fresh breath at the store.</p>

        <p>I don’t. My life is effectively over by now. We could wake up tomorrow to a miracle where COVID and lockdowns are guaranteed to be gone for all eternity, and I would feel nothing and probably wouldn’t feel the desire to even go outside and participate in the world anymore. I would say I’m just “existing” at this point, but even that seems too generous.</p>
