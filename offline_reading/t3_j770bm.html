    <strong>No man is an island, unless you live in fucking California</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve fucking had it. </p>
<p>I have to wear a mask at work. I‚Äôm a manager, I love my job, I‚Äôm good at it and passionate about it so I do it. I hate it but I do it, and never fucking complain.</p>
<p>Then today I had a therapy session. I knew my therapist was drinking a bit of the fear Kool Ade, but he‚Äôd been ok about things, we‚Äôd be mask-less in my sessions at my request. It‚Äôs my therapy session, I‚Äôm not going to sit there talking at fucking Shredder from Ninja Turtles for an hour. </p>
<p>Today, he asked me to wear a mask. He wore one all session. I wouldn‚Äôt do it. I almost fucking walked out 5 minutes in. It hurt, honestly. I told him I‚Äôm working hard at knowing and being my authentic self, and I can‚Äôt do that behind a fucking mask I don‚Äôt believe is necessary in the one place in my life right now I‚Äôm supposed to be able to be truly real and honest. </p>
<p>He tried to engage me on my rona stance. I laid out some data, some of my POV on this bullshit excuse of a reality being pushed by The Psychopaths That Be, and to his credit the guy actually heard me, validated a lot of what I said but there‚Äôs just a cognitive dissonance there that won‚Äôt let go. He‚Äôs convinced we‚Äôre dealing with a highly contagious and dangerous virus, and I guess that‚Äôs that. Anyway, this is my therapy session, not my bully pulpit for bringing my therapist to Rational Jesus. What am I paying for here? </p>
<p>So, just venting here really. Glad to have one place I can actually say what I feel. You‚Äôd think a therapists office would be that place, but I guess an Internet forum will have to do, since I don‚Äôt even fucking have that anymore. I‚Äôm a person that just about never feels lonely but fuck I feel alone right now, here in the great State of Fear of California, proud home of the eternal lockdown. I swear everyone I know here has absolutely lost their fucking minds. It‚Äôs beyond shocking. I get along with everyone but deep down I have lost all respect for each and every one of them, and I know that will never go away. </p>
<p>I think I‚Äôm done with therapy. It looks like the whole fucking world needs it more than I do anyway. I know someone with a slot that just opened up if anyone wants a session. Ninja Turtle roleplay available on request.</p></p>

        <p>Have you considered having video conferencing or telephone appointment, then this wouldn't even be an issue. Perhaps, your therapist did it deliberately to "challenge" you, last time my therapist challenged me, that was my last therapy session, they are supposed to be there to actively listen and provide feedback, not try to break down your entire thought process. I feel sorry for you in Cali, I'm in Michigan, not too much better, but I read a tweet from your governor about wearing a mask between chewing bites of food at a restaurant and decided never to step foot into California.</p>
<p>We recently had our supreme court overturn all of our governors orders and then she just had the dept of health put in their own mandates under a different law. The mask Nazis are relentless.</p>

        <p>Yeah you don't need a therapist who has no common sense. I can't see how someone so small minded is supposed to help you feel better about things. </p>
<p>This may be controversial but it's my experience: the only people who I've heard have benefitted from therapy are women. I've been told my whole life that therapy would help. Thing is I know there's nothing wrong with me, I just don't ignore the realities of this world and pretend everything is fine like 95% of people do. </p>
<p>Don't let people make you think you need help just because these empty societies we live in leave you feeling empty. That's just a sign that you are human.</p>

        <p>You called an opinion that reflects their observations sexist. That's not how sexism works, that's not how any of this works.</p>
<p>I've only heard birds calling during the day around where I live. Guess what, that's not the same as me saying that birds only call during the day everywhere.</p>
<p>If he had said that "only women benifit" then I might agree with you, assuming that the declaration wasn't backed by good data. Saying "the only ones I've heard" is anecdotal and completely valid to the op. It isn't a statement of fact that applies to everyone, and he never said it was.</p>

        <p>The issue is, some people truly believe there is no difference between men and women. So then the statement by the OP would indeed be sexist in that view because what he said could not possibly be true - it would no longer be a matter of opinion because it can't be real, and it would be sexist on that basis, that there is even a perceived difference between men and women.</p>
<p>Basically, much like the COVID response, it's all bullshit.</p>

        <p>"I believe humans are like this for a reason because talking doesn't help most men. This attidude forces us to grow up and learn to be strong on our own. Or you can remain a child forever and look for people to cry to which seems to be what society suggests."</p>
<p>This was his response. The observation itself in the original comment is not sexist, as you so effectively pointed out with your bird analogy. The overall attitude towards men in therapy and the assertion that seeking help is akin to "remaining a child forever" are harmful and sexist.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you found help in counseling. It's not to say that it can't help men, just that, in my experience, I've only know women say it helped them. Is my life experience sexist?</p>
<p>I have struggled a lot but I don't anymore so I know EXACTLY what helped me. I refuse to let people gaslight me with "if men would just open up more." There is nobody to open up to. It doesn't work for men. That is victim blaming of the highest degree. Nobody has time for our problems, even your girlfriend will get fed up of listening eventually. This is a good thing. I believe humans are like this for a reason because talking doesn't help most men. This attidude forces us to grow up and learn to be strong on our own. Or you can remain a child forever and look for people to cry to which seems to be what society suggests. </p>
<p>You have to find meaning in your life and understand that you are alone and learn to be fine with that and find strength in that. Once I stopped looking for people to understand me/people to open up to and just dealt with my shit myself, my life got a whole lot easier.</p>

        <p>Your therapist is a sick individual. Mentally, that is. Literally, sick. The insistence on treating the healthy as if they are sick has a clinical diagnosis - it‚Äôs called Munchausen syndrome.</p>
<p>Glad to hear you are going to get a new therapist. Best of luck in your search. It won‚Äôt be easy. Most of them, especially in California, do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I was a lifelong Californian. Wife and I moved to a red state over the summer. Government oppression and the servile stupidity of the citizenry was too much to bear. So, I feel your pain brother. 100%.</p>
<p>All I can say is, do everything you can to continue to remain firmly in the driver‚Äôs seat of your life. No move is too big to make right now. You still have some freedom left. Use it.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt be afraid to make a big play in the pursuit of sanity.</p>

        <p>Good for you. </p>
<p>People keep telling me a therapist would help. Not because I'm constantly crazy or anything, I'm just down and struggle to find any meaning in my life. </p>
<p>I always knew it wouldn't help. You story just helps to confirm that. I went to therapists as a kid and had two different ones tell my mother that I'm too awkward and I'm not open to help. Basically I was too intelligent for their basic ass kiddy mind tricks and they failed at their job but that was my fault somehow. </p>
<p>Anyway, since realising that most the population of the world are mindless assholes who will gladly take away your autonomy after consuming a bit of government propaganda. I can't imagine myself opening up to one of them in the hope that their small scared mind can help me.</p>
<p>I since realised I'm not depressed at all. I'm just aware of the world we live in and it's natural to feel down and disappointed in humanity when you are aware of these things. </p>
<p>We don't need therapy. We just need to keep living in reality and not let bastards make you question your sanity.</p>

        <p>Studies have shown that what is healing about therapy is the relationship, the trust. Masking disrupts all that, and you just cannot have a real connection with a partially wrapped bobbing head and a set of eyes, no way.</p>

        <p>Some solidarity: </p>
<p>I had one session with a therapist that my parents have seen for years. I explained how angry I was at the injustice of the world and how it is affecting me. At first he helped me a little but then he went on a 15 minute rant about masks and his fear of the virus. I asked him to change the subject but he ignored me and kept going for another 5 minutes. I'm never seeing him again.</p>

<p>I did get a glimmer of hope last night. A friend and I went out for a pizza outdoor dining. The gentleman next to us got up to go to the restroom. He forgot his mask. An employee wouldn't give him the bathroom code unless he put his mask on. So he got his mask. We got to talking about what just happened and ended up connecting with a fellow sane person. It was incredibly refreshing to meet someone who doesn't buy in to all the bullcrap and actually listens to science and all the updated info on rona.</p>

        <p>Maybe try online therapy from another corner of the planet? A part that's a little closer to reality and normality? A therapy session shouldn't be political, but at least through it you can see how deep your agitation is right now.</p>
<p>See what you can find to bring a little peace to yourself, just for you. None of us could ever control the world, but we can settle ourselves to react to it in a way that doesn't break our hearts so much.</p>

        <p>It's been 19 years since 9/11, and the truth still hasn't won on that front. The truth may eventually win, but how many of us will last that long?</p>

        <p>I was in therapy for a while before this happened but I quit going in late 2019 because I moved to a new city and I was doing fine. Since lockdowns started I've been acutely aware of my mental health decline and I know I need to go back to therapy, but I refuse to accept a virtual substitute nor will I wear a mask. "I‚Äôm working hard at knowing and being my authentic self, and I can‚Äôt do that behind a fucking mask I don‚Äôt believe is necessary in the one place in my life right now I‚Äôm supposed to be able to be truly real and honest." I couldn't agree more brother. I'm not sure what I would've done in your position. I think when it got to the point where I was presenting a scientific argument to try to convince my therapist to take his mask off I would have definitely walked out. I'm sorry this happened to you. You're not alone.</p>

        <p>I find it amusing how people blindly follow those in power. In peru, they implemented a totally nonsensical covid law that mandated that men and women were only to leave the house at alternating days, one day, only men could leave the house, the other only women could leave the house; and still a lot of people don't care, they won't question their leaders, who were sent by god (science) to rule in their name.</p>

        <p>We all need to start eliminating these idiots from our lives wherever we find them. I'm sorry this happened though. I was in therapy years ago and remembering that state of mind I can imagine how awful that would feel.</p>

        <p>I totally relate- I can‚Äôt stand seeing people in masks and my therapist gave me a medical exemption but it doesn‚Äôt seem to get me anywhere.
I‚Äôm in LA County and it‚Äôs been hell. Thank God I‚Äôm moving to a conservative part of Colorado where life is much more open and free.

        <p>So why are the masks such a big deal for you? Do you feel you can‚Äôt be your authentic self with your face isn‚Äôt visible and if so why? If why not, why the issues with masks? If someone doing something for themselves bothers you so much that you have to walk out of therapy do you not think you need to stay in therapy? Idk I just wear a mask most days and it really barely bothers me, hardly notice it and actually think a lot of them look nice and help to show of people features like their eyes and such. I just reaaaally get the issues with masks lol</p>
