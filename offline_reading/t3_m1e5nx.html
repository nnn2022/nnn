    <strong>Evidence hospitals misreport COVID deaths?</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone have any sources of widespread reporting of deaths being attributed to COVID when the patient did not have COVID at all?</p>
<p>Some rules:
- source must have high factual reporting
- source must not be far from center
- death in question must be of a person who had not contracted COVID</p>
<p>This seemed like the best place to ask. My gf’s parents and I sometimes debate this and I’d like some concrete evidence to fall back on, and have been unsuccessful in finding reputable sources on the topic. Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>Read the CDC Covert Alert #2 from March 24 2020. It allows a death to be categorized as a covid death even in the absence of a positive test, as long as the doctor believes covid was a contributing factor.  From the examples provided, the death certificate needn't show WHY the doc thought it was covid-related.  What this means, essentially, is there's no evidence.  </p>
<p>There was a ...Wisconsin? (somewhere out there, it's been linked in this sub)  report that something like 40% of the deaths listed as covid were clearly something else (gsw, mva, etc), but that's all I can think of that someone went through stacks of death certificates and made their own assessments.  Even that doesn't contradict a doctor's assertion, so proving misreporting or willful deception will be pretty much impossible.</p>

        <p>I am aware that there are situations where there could be misrepresentation, and what the CDC sets forth to allow for that, and why they did it.</p>
<p>What I’m looking for is evidence of cases where there is clear evidence a patient perished by some other means, but had cause of death on the certificate listed as Covid.</p>

        <p>https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/related-to-obvious-other-causes-gunshot-victims-included-in-washington-coronavirus-death-tally</p>
<p>Mostly there are a lot of anecdotes of the form "gunshot victim..." or "auto accident victim counted as covid death."  There were several such after one of the newspapers ran the names of all the covid-related deaths at the time.  The only real pattern of fraud is referenced in a quote in that article:</p>
<p>'“Our dashboard numbers do include any death to a person that has tested positive to COVID-9,” Hutchison said.'</p>
<p>This is the same as the UK policy, "[x] deaths from ALL CAUSES within 28 days of a positive test."  In both cases, literally, we are including non-covid deaths in the covid tallies as long as there was, at some point prior, a positive test.</p>
<p>Again, as long as doctors can write down whatever they want even in the presence of contrary evidence, actual assessments of the breadth of the fraud will be impossible to gauge.  Talk to some ICU nurses about what is killing the patients in their wards.  Broadly, it's normal end-of-life stuff.  Cancer, heart disease, renal failure, etc.  Calling these covid deaths because of a meaningless positive PCR is the crux of this fraud, but it's intentional on the WHO/CDC/s part more than that of hospital doctors.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/">this site</a>, the Washington Examiner has a very right bias with only a “Mixed” rating on factual reporting, with four failed fact checks listed. Editorially, it’s 100% right, and is own by a Christian conservative billionaire with a history of donating millions to anti-LGBT hate groups. Not exactly what I’d call a trustworthy source, unfortunately.</p>
<p>As for the WHO/CDC intentionally setting up a system where numbers could be misreported, what could they possibly stand to gain from doing that? This is another parallel claim I’ve heard often but never argued for, because I could never fathom a motive.</p>

        <p>Read the WHO and CDC death reporting instructions.</p>
<p>Look for "CDC Covid Alert #2 from March 24, 2020".</p>
<p>The wording allows for doctors to count a covid death and death where covid caused, contributed to, or is believed to have contributed to the death.  Belief.  No tests, no verification, the belief of the doctor.</p>
<p>I won't try to guess why here, but the instructions are quite permissive.</p>
<p>As to specific misreporting, the UK was initially counting any death, from any cause, at any time, if there had ever been a positive pcr test.  It was well reported and should be trivial to find.  They only later reduced it to 28 days.  There was also an irish video a LONG time back where the health minister confirmed this policy, to include "if someone comes in to the hospital with a broken arm, tests positive, it will be counted as a covid hospitalization."  Sorry, way too lazy to search for these myself right now, but they really should be easy to find via google or searching this sub (or r/LockdownSkepticsm)</p>

<p>Colorado has been reported to use the "within 30 days" classification as well.  I believe other states have, but a quick search isn't finding links.  This classification isn't in either the WHO or CDC guidelines, so I'm wondering where it came from, to be used both in UK and some US states.</p>

        <p>So while I concede there is margin for error when attributing a death to Covid in the absence of a positive test (not to be confused with the presence of a negative test, which is different), it seems probably that a COPD patient suddenly dying during a pandemic could, in all likelihood, be due to Covid. It’s unfortunate that at the beginning, when testing was not widely available, this was likely happening all too often. I don’t see any excuse for not conducting tests on dying patients for the sake of accurate data and reporting today. Regardless of the presence of misrepresentation, I would like to know the truth.</p>
<p>It’s also notable that the article says the following:
&rt; But let’s make one thing absolutely clear: it is nonsense to suggest, as conspiracy theorists and virus deniers would have you believe, that doctors en masse are deliberately falsifying certificates to exaggerate the number of Covid deaths to justify behavioural and travel restrictions; in other words, that this all part of some government plot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this source is listed as having <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/daily-mail/">solidly right bias and low factual reporting.</a> I noticed when they quoted “medical practitioners” and a “funeral director” they did not include the names of individuals. For all anyone knows, these quotes were completely fabricated. The article also reads like an editorial piece. Which is fine, but what I’m looking for specifically is fact-based, non biased journalism. Unfortunately, I don’t think DailyMail fits that bill.</p>
