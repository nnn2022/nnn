    <strong>I think they have overplayed their hand</strong>
    <p><p>the diverse group that are against the lock down measures does not dovetail well with the political narrative. </p>
<p>i think the more truth the bubbles up will only grow our numbers , and we are accepting on ANY free thinkers.</p>
<p>i can't think of any discussion where we have told the pro-mask brigadiers to self-harm or anyone wished harm on them as in "other" subs.</p>
<p>if you think that you don't belong here, you are probably wrong - patriots come in a variety of forms, and while we might disagree on specific issues, there is plenty of room with broad issues as we face today.</p></p>

<p>Either that, or they perfectly know what they're doing, and mass civil unrest is part of the plan.</p>
<p>It could be an excuse for calling martial law and locking down the globe even more.</p>

<p>That sure is what it looks like.</p>
<p>I've seen suspicious about this once I noticed Sky News Australia had been covering "The Great Reset" and took a Covid-skeptic position on multiple occasions. And now I've seen Fox New criticising "The Great Reset" as well.</p>
<p>They're clearly trying to rally up "the right".</p>

<p>That's besides the point. The point is that "they" seem to want a section of the population to know about "The Great Reset" and the Covid scam. Call that part of the population whatever you want.</p>
<p>Also, why about sources like Computing Forever &amp; James Corbett? Why haven't they been banned from Youtube yet? If "the elites" want no one to know about "the Great Reset" and the Covid-19 scam, you'd think these channels would have been deleted a long time ago...</p>

        <p>yeah i feel like if the top tier of society came up w a plan they wanted to implement, they would and all this 'obvious' behavior is obvious on purpose. they're probably not gonna suck at it this bad. it obviously doesn't feel right when these things get 'leaked' and 'exposed' or just flat out said on mega news corps or the front pages of google results.</p>
<p>either way it doesnt seem to amount to much besides confirm our suspicions and go right over the heads of the sheeple. maybe it converts a few hundred peeps here and there, or confirms suspicions of the currently incredulous. but its not like its gonna make us all suddenly rally together. it probably actually causes more division somehow lol.</p>
<p>like you said its a wink and a nod to us, and to the people that already trust them, its just them being transparent. so we get even more pissed, while the trust of the sheeple deepens. and therefore we and the sheeple butt heads even harder. we scream conspiracy while they tell us theres nothing secretive about it. i donno some shit like that lol.</p>
<p>and yeah they probably leave certain youtubers up because they're controlled opp, or they're genuine, but either way are serving a purpose for their plan.</p>
<p>Edit: although, i also sometimes wonder if the division is created. Like as in not really all that real. Like they do that with pc culture all the time. In this case it would be some crazy coordination. But maybe theyre like staging whole subreddits or most of said subs and only a medium to small portion of em are real. Like what if weâ€™re the majority? Reasons i think it might be that way: most people i know and discuss this with question it in one way or another. Or are full blown skeptics. Then again i dont really chill w fools so that could be a misleading observation. But also, those subs seem literally fake af. Like twilight zoned tf out to an insane degree that its hard for me to fathom. I was reading a thread with my mouth hanging wide tf open. Then again, people are stupid. So, donno.</p>

        <p>They aren't banned because they were put in that position to do what they do. A good example is YouTube banning channels that point out the OBVIOUS election fraud, except for the "allowed" channels that can talk about. Crowder. Tatum are two big examples.</p>

        <p>Ya some of the "overplaying" just seems so deliberate.</p>
<p>As in "Any illuminati worthy of the name would not be stupid enough to do that".</p>
<p>Perfect example is are all the disclaimers coming out about the vaccine right now. Things that are making people nervous. If there was such control over the media, as has been demonstrated to even get to this point, you just wouldnt hear that stuff.</p>
<p>I bet there is going to be some big scare with the vaccine that will be blamed on "spreading conspiracies" in some way.  It will make lots of people say "NOPE" to the vaccine. The Government will say that means that not enough are getting the vaxx now to achieve herd immunity.</p>
<p>So then you will have the anti-vaxxers and conspiracy nuts being blamed for not allowing things to get back to normal. Maybe that will push support for a mandatory shot?  It would definitely be a good excuse to crack down on "lies".</p>
<p>At any rate, it will be lucky that the military is rolling out the vaccine distribution, because that will mean that if things happen to get to civil unrest stage, they will have conveniently already deployed through the entire country.</p>

        <p>&rt;Ya some of the "overplaying" just seems so deliberate.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As in "Any illuminati worthy of the name would not be stupid enough to do that".</p>
<p>And what about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/k94915/on_28_november_2020_in_more_than_15_big_cities_in/gf25o7o/?context=3">these guys</a>?</p>
<p>Just like Extinction Rebellion a while ago, they pop up all out of nowhere in several countries with highly coordinated and well-rehearsed protect actions.</p>
<p>This is obviously astroturfing. But why? And to what end?</p>
<p>Something very dark is brewing behind the curtains. I don't know what, but I don like it...</p>

        <p>I wish Republicans hadn't co-opted the term "patriot". When I was a kid it just meant "I support the ideals of my country". Now it's just a republican virtue signal.</p>

        <p>I suppose I agree. I'm certainly not a republican, and modern ideals of the USA do not align with the original goals of the constitution. I'm a patriot towards a country that exists only in spirit.</p>

        <p>I honestly think "Patriots" is not an appropriate name.</p>
<p>This is an international phemomenon.</p>
<p>The people who are protesting around the world at what is happening are not doing it for a love of their flag, but out of a common hate for something that doesnt seem to stop at borders.</p>
