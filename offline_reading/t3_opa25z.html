<title>The good thing about so many of these people that are so negative, afraid and resentful is that it's so in your face and obvious that there's no way their children will see them behaving like this and not think "I don't want to be like you when I grow up."</title>

    <strong>The good thing about so many of these people that are so negative, afraid and resentful is that it's so in your face and obvious that there's no way their children will see them behaving like this and not think "I don't want to be like you when I grow up."</strong>
    <p><p>This isn't even necessarily about the people buying into the fear about the Coronavirus but it includes them, too.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These people do not do a good job of hiding away these negative emotions and it's so obvious that their children will have to make a conscious decision to be like that or choose to not live in fear, doubt, resentment, etc, and <em>that</em> is a blessing when you really think about it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But like I was saying, their insufferability is so obvious (no matter what political or ideological leaning) that they are holding a mirror up to ourselves and we have to ask ourselves, is this energy in me too? Am I just hiding better? And do I choose to continue to be like this or do I change?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And it may be unpopular here but these lockdowns have lead to so much introspection amongst people.</p>
<p>Last year was surely the most quiet the planet has been in so, so many years.</p>
<p>So many people reconsidering relationships, jobs, living conditions, family the feel tied down by, etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So many people made life changing decisions during this that it's definitely a good thing it happened when you look at the big picture.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We won't see it for some time but during that time, science took leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>As scientists attempted to figure out what was going on, they discovered so many new things and it's only a matter of time until they start showing hthe public what they discovered.</p></p>

        <p>Oh my, this post is so ridiculously out of touch with reality that I must assume it's a troll or shill account.</p>
<p>There is no way that any positivity you are looking for comes anywhere near the hardship, anxiety, depression, fear, conflict, and economic destruction of 2020. No way.</p>
<p>I guess it's one person's opinion over another's, and maybe OP is so well off financially that s/he just doesn't know what life is like for normal people.</p>
<p>And life for the poor? God I can't even imagine. Prices rising, rents rising, owning a home further out of reach, family stress hurting children, masks breaking children socially.</p>
<p>Oddly enough this is one of the strangest posts I've seen here in a year and half.</p>
