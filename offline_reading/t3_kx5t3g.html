    <strong>How to deal with UK supermarkets illegally stopping people without masks from entering.</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly this is actually caused by the government, the laws around masks in shops HAVE NOT CHANGED (i.e. lots of exceptions and no need for proof).</p>
<p>What the government has done (Matt Wankcock's department?) is contact all the major super-markets and tell them that MASKS ARE REQUIRED, NO EXCEPTIONS, ENFORCEMENT NEEDED.</p>
<p>IF you live in the UK it's now YOUR job to educate the poor people who have been told to enforce this illegal thing.</p>
<p>It's not their fault (these are just normal people going about their lives), they've been given commands from on high.</p>
<p><strong><em>Assuming that you have a valid reason for not wearing a mask covered in the non-exhaustive list of exceptions (physical/mental disability, extreme anxiety, trauma etc.).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them you are exempt.</p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them you are not required to show evidence of this or wear a lanyard or anything of the sort.</p>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> tell them this is the law, and that them refusing you access on the basis of not wearing a mask they are breaking the law:</p>
<ul>
<li>2010 Equalities act</li>
<li>2020 Coronavirus act</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calmly</strong> show them the government rules on this (using your mobile phone or a handy printout)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own/face-coverings-when-to-wear-one-and-how-to-make-your-own</a></p>
<p>Go to section: <strong>When you do not need to wear a face covering</strong></p>
<p>&rt;people who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability</p>
<p>Go to section: <strong>Exemption cards</strong></p>
<p>&rt;If you have an age, health or disability reason for not wearing a face covering:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>you do not routinely need to show any written evidence of this</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>you do not need show an exemption card</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This means that you do not need to seek advice or request a letter from a medical professional about your reason for not wearing a face covering.</p>
<p>Explain that this is the governments own website, and that you are sorry but head office has made a mistake in what they have told you, this is the law.</p>
<p>If they don't budge, ask to see a manager, and educate THEM using the above process</p>
<p>Educate your fellow Brits please.</p></p>

        <p>problem is, you are trying to reason with a person who no longer operates on reason, but on fear.</p>
<p>such situations could get easily violent, especially if the person is a suuper-doomer...</p>
<p>if someone is scared shitless, reason wont reach them. most likely.
you are reasonable because you did not buy into the propaganda and are not scared shitless, so your approach is a reasonable one. but that is short sighted, because you are not considering the NPC's POV...</p>
<p>edit: i am not saying this to negate what you told - obviously, do that, please, everyone.. but calculate what I just said into the equation! otherwise you may be surprised with some reactions to your behavior!</p>

        <p>I think it's an important distinction to make. Most people are NOT operating on fear. Some are, and they're the loudest zealots, but they're the minority. Most people are playing monkey-see-monkey-do, no more no less.</p>

        <p>What happens if they say that the law does not matter when it comes down to private businesses? </p>
<p>Is there a discrimination law that would hold them on that side as well?</p>

        <p>As mentioned in the post, they would be violating the 2010 Equalities act, this covers discrimination against disabled people.</p>
<p>Fines go from £900-£9000 or something like that.</p>
<p>So yes, people preventing disabled peopled who ARE exempt from wearing a mask into the store are discriminating against a disability, and breaking the law, thus opening themselves up to legal and/or police action.</p>

        <p>They’re not private property if they have a business license. They can’t pick and choose who they want in a store.</p>
<p>When open they are actively inviting the public to enter and they must abide by rules such as discrimination laws.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that makes sense. 
I dont know why I am being downvoted. I thought the answers to my question could help someone since a lot of places are claiming that theyre private and thats how they can enforce these rules etc.</p>
