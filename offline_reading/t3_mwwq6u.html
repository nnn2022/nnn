        <p>SS: While I very much believe global-warming is real and we as a human race need to start changing our ways, I also believe there is no way in hell that the past year made any significant impact on reducing pollution. There are still just as many cars on the road as before, aside from maybe the first month or so of lockdowns.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing they’ll keep pushing, blaming it on our consumption, when in reality it’s the major corporations and their greed that are destroying us. No amount of recycling plastic bottles or eating less red meat or buying a Tesla will make up for the behemoths that continue to produce harmful products to our environment. If they really wanted to save the planet, the infrastructure would be the first thing they would change. WAKE UP Y’ALL. It’s always been about control.</p>

        <p>All you need to do is look at a chart of average temperature since the start of the industrial revolution and it’s pretty obvious that the Earth is growing hotter at an exponential rate. </p>
<p>The problem is, big industry does not want to change their ways.</p>

        <p>No, it's not exponential.  </p>
<p>CO2 used to be much higher.  Thousands of PPM.</p>
<p>CO2 is good for the planet.   Plants crave it.   Humans like plants because we eat them and get oxygen from them.</p>
<p>Big industry feeds you and me and supplies us with stuff.   The alternative at this point is a massive die off, or we start colonizing other planets.   </p>
<p>If you really think this way, you need to stop using the internet first off.  It's a huge consumer of electricity.</p>

        <p>&rt;The earth's climate is always changing.
&rt;
&rt;Here, the weather guys can barely get a forecast right for 24hrs from now.   Four days out is usually wrong. <br>
Well what about el Niño and LA Nina? </p>
<p>They can make fairly accurate predictions about the general rain trends... </p>
<p>&rt;I'm supposed to believe they can predict a 100 years from now?</p>
<p>Exactly? No. Trends yes. </p>
<p>&rt;In the 1970s, the coming Ice Age was all the rage.  By 2000 the northern US was supposed to have been uninhabitable.   Then there was the Acid Rain scare, and all plant life was going to be gone.</p>
<p>You mean the acid rain problem that was solved by the majority of nations changing their pollution standards...? </p>
<p>What about the ozone layer being depleted by cfc's? Then they were stopped and the ozone is recovering... </p>
<p>The other things you list are a mix of published papers studying a topic, and the media telling you it's true uncritically. It's not like all scientists thought that. </p>
<p>It's almost like the media aren't scientists and will lie to all papers.. </p>
<p>&rt;Climate change scares are just like Virus scares.   They are meant to trigger an emotional response so you will accept change.</p>
<p>Can be used the same way. What of this virus had a 50% mortality? Wouldn't that be something to worry about?</p>
<p>I don't disagree with the last statement, I'm just not convinced that that's anyone but politicians, ideologues, and 'journalists'.</p>

Now, they have scientific proof to back a culling.</p>
