    <strong>Possible virus scenario.</strong>
    <p><p>Consider your a mover behind the scenes and you want to slim down the population and remove the trouble makers from society. So you create a scenario where the trouble makers will group themselves instead of you needing to seek them out.</p>
<p>You create a public scare, with enough info available that this is not what it seems. And you pepper in so it would be unmissable.</p>
<p>Then introduce a vax. that no trouble maker would possibly take. One designed for a different purpose. To protect from a super virus. (or worse not) Sure there will be some collateral damage. Might as well remove some weaker genes while your at it. All part of the reduction.</p>
<p>Wait till the vax rates plateau to release the real monster. A virus that infects and kills like you told the people the first one would.</p>
<p>When your virus is released the trouble makers will not only not take precautions but quite the opposite. They will run to their deaths. Because they have no idea this is new. And the last one was no real threat to them. Just look at the actors partying.</p>
<p>Modern society to hunger games in 2 years.</p>
<p>I am not posting this to say this is happening. Or even probably whats happening. I am just saying there are a lot of outbreaks reported and none of this makes any sense.</p>
<p>We should always hope for the best but plan for the worst.</p></p>

        <p>No, no, no. This line of thinking is another attempt to trick us into saying yes, and it keeps getting echoed here.</p>
<p>THINK.</p>
<p>The powers that be would never deliberately release a virus that could potentially harm themselves and their families.</p>
<p>Also, these people come from families with a history of interest in eugenics. If they are "getting rid of" anyone, it's going to be the weak and unintelligent "useless eaters." (Not my phrase.)</p>
<p>The threat is the vaccine. That is controlled. The virus is the trick, to scare unintelligent people into taking what is in all likelihood a biological weapon.</p>

        <p>This. It makes no sense that they would want stupid people to live. This is a test to see who can pass the cut and survive under pressure. They want strong people to make the species stronger, not retards and soy boys. They want to rebuild society magnificent again, not watch grown adults have temper tantrums and burn it down.</p>

        <p>I dont know. Seems there is an awful lot of autism in recent years. People that just work and sit. Not much else. Its been said they need a small number of labors to work farms etc.</p>
<p>For wanting to build a magnificent society they sure are doing a crappy job.</p>
<p>I dont want to push fear but I dont think this virus is fake either. I have been very sick and I know people that have died from it, not with it. I also know a guy who died of the vax.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting stupid people would survive, just obedient ones. Though plenty are not creative thinkers.</p>
<p>Worth discussion though I hope.</p>

        <p>I should have stated. I will NOT be getting the vax. </p>
<p>Potentially harm their families? I think they would. History says they would. In 1988 Prince Phillip said he wanted to be reincarnated as a virus . I think it was something about killing 90% of the people.</p>
<p>I agree the vax is a nightmare but giving us an impossible choice would be the smart way to get what they want. Vax or not your hosed.</p>
<p>Worth discussing anyway I hope.</p>

        <p>Actually, it’s a win-win-win. </p>
<p>Purge the extremely weak with a lab-created virus, the weaker with the vaccine, and the strongest in death camps after they refuse the vaccine.</p>
