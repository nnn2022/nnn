        <p>Right before all of this started, my Grandmother was dying in the hospital from kidney failure.  It went on for a few months and right at the end is when Covid came along.  When she died they refused to release her body until they tested her for Covid.  They ran the test and she came back negative.  On her death certificate they listed the cause of death as Covid regardless.  When my Uncle called the doctor to ask what the hell is going on the doctor essentially replied "Even though the test came back negative we are going with Covid as cause of death because test not entirely accurate."</p>

Then my aunt said one of her church friends died 12 hours after getting it but stated it was okay bc " she had a bunch of health problems".

        <p>They do track vaccine related deaths and they are EXTREMELY rare and from processes present with ALL vaccines, so nothing new. The reason they track deaths to Covid so late afterwards is because of how the disease process works. First of all, Covid can cause organ stress/failures by means of metabolic overload or thrombosis. Second, Covid, like many other viral illnesses, causes susceptibility to MANY other disease processes that are normally quite manageable. Therefore if they suscept to a disease exacerbated by Covid then that is a Covid death.</p>

        <p>Also, being a professional doesn’t always equivocate to being correct on a certain point. Asking someone their credentials is not helpful in the slightest. That aside, I am very well read up on the disease process as well as mechanisms of vaccines. They’re nothing new, and completely safe. You guys on this sub want “nonewnormal”, yet seemingly are against the very (simple) thing that would allow us to go back to old normal. Just being difficult to be difficult.

        <p>You do realize that most of us follow the damn Rona rules and ain’t shit is going back to normal. Also mRNA vaccines is something very new. So idk if you’re really that smart girl. Just because some of us don’t feel like taking the shot, doesn’t mean we are the reason why we can’t go back to normal. Makes absolutely no sense. Also what is the vaccine good for? It doesn’t stop the spread, you still get infected and can infect others. Does that make sense to you? Also it is very good that I ask you where you get your info from. Hearin stuff on the tv is not the best source, that’s why I asked.</p>

        <p>That is exactly one of the reasons we can’t go back to normal. It’s called herd immunity, look it up. Also, your claims about spreadability are tenuous. While, yes, we are still taking precautions as if it is still able to be spread, that may turn out to be not necessary with more data. It is very likely that it does not spread if the vaccine is effective, which it is. Also, mRNA is new as a specific vaccine, but does not change the mechanism by which vaccines work. It is a prominent/unique identifier that the body recognizes as a foreign invader that allows for the body to prepare antibodies for future use, thus allowing rapid deployment with contact with real virus. I could go into germ theory about viral load in relation to spreadability, but this is Reddit and you likely wouldn’t understand or want to understand, more importantly. </p>
<p>The vaccine IS FDA approved, just emergently. The vaccine passed through the phase 3 clinical trial with flying colors, which is the phase that every other vaccine in history has gone through in order prove viability and safety. The only reason this one was developed faster is that mRNA was studied profusely during swine flu, so we were well prepared for this subtype as far as inoculation goes, and it received unlimited funding, something many vaccines struggle with. </p>
<p>Your comparison with hitler is juvenile. It’s not just about asking questions, it’s about asking the right ones. The scientists (who are by their nature, skeptics) are asking the right questions. There’s no one more ready to disprove a scientist than another scientist. Your inquiry and assumptions are unfounded as you clearly don’t even understand viral processes or simple things such as herd immunity. </p>
<p>Also, I’m a dude, not that I care that you called me girl. I’d be a very pretty girl.</p>

        <p>But how can you have herd immunity with a vaccine THAT DOESNT MAKE YOU IMMUNE. It just doesn’t make any sense. Also when you go get vaccinated, you get a pamphlet which says that this vaccine is not fda approved. Stop with this bullshit bro. I have been lurking on subs like covidvaccinated too and imma tell you this, the people are scared. They turn sick af and get rashes and other shit. Why would I, 20 year old healthy female, do that to myself. For a virus that has a survival rate of 99,98%? Does this make sense to you?</p>

        <p>Lol I am vaccinated and have been for awhile. I work with people that are vaccinated and take care of patients that have been vaccinated, none of which have had adverse side effects. The CDC keeps VERY close records and what you’re reporting anecdotally does not match. You are making stuff up to fit your narrative, while I have statistics. Also the vaccine DOES make you immune. Immunity and spreadability are two very separate things. Also, I’ve already addressed the point about spreadability, if that’s what you’re talking about. Again, your ignorance of basic science and even nomenclature in this case is showing. You should remove your foil hat, your conspiracy is showing.</p>

The CDC doesn’t report shit, except the high fake cases of corona. Just because what I say doesn’t match to a fake news outlet, doesn’t mean that it’s not true. I have knowledge of basic science, probably more than you. I have more than basic knowledge in chemistry. And all I can do is cringe when I read the ingredients of some medicine, they trying to sell us. Including the covid vaccine. Which is NOT FDA APPROVED, for a goddamn reason. Anything that is against this virus is a conspiracy. In a few months is the truth.</p>

        <p>Im not making shit up. You’re just trying to discredit my opinion, by saying I’m making shit up and calling me a tinfoil hat. Vaccines have nothing to do with health. It’s chemistry. It’s a bunch of chemicals mixed together in a cocktail, then injected. Stupid, that’s what you are. I’m hyper allergic to potassium chloride, which is one of the ingredients of the vaccine. It could kill me. Definitely. Go read and look at the pictures on covidvaccinated. It’s terrible. I don’t understand how you can be this ignorant and say I’m making stuff up.</p>

        <p>Lol you clearly don’t know what KCl is as it is the fundamental electrolyte used by cardiac tissue to fuel electrical impulses that beat the very heart that pumps your blood. If you were allergic to KCl, you ma’am would be dead. I’m an ER nurse. I’m very aware of what potassium is. I administer it daily. You are not allergic, no human is. Your rants are nonsensical and still do not come from a scientific standpoint. Calling the CDC a “fake news source” is laughable. If they’re fake news, then I’m not at all sure how I’ve been able to take their advice and successfully impact and save people’s lives on a weekly basis. I must be getting lucky, or god does it. He’s just as likely to disprove me as you. Ask him and let me know</p>

        <p>It’s not juvenile to compare this to how Hitler acted. If you know a little about history, you’d understand. Hitler won because people adored him and believed every little word the man had to say. Just like today, people fully trust their government. Jew passports just like vaccine passports will be required sooner or later. The Jews had their stamps and passports so people always knew, that is a Jew. Just like with the vaccine passports, if you don’t have one you’re going to be eventually fucked. Just like the nazis always sad „It’s just a shower“ we say today „It’s just a vaccine“. I’m from Germany. I am German. Ik wtf im talking about. The Ermächtigungsgesetz Hitler used „for the people’s own safety“ is the same thing as the infektionsschutzgesetz. It gives the government full power over you. Which should make you realize that we don’t have a say in this world. The Bilderberg conference is where People decide over our head, what’s going to happen with us next. We don’t live in a democracy.</p>

        <p>Lol, now you’re making things up. You cannot find a source to back your claims, yet the cdc is reporting everything in contradiction to what you’re saying. I’m an ER nurse and I’m sick of dealing with you misinformer, crazy people. You guys make my job and life hellish. Vaccines are safe, always have been. They literally just cause an immune response similar, but muted compared to the actual disease. It’s not a hard concept, yet you people still can’t understand. Where are your statistics? Just because you FEEL something is someway does not make it real. I have statistics and analysis from accurate and knowledgeable governing bodies, you do not. Sit the fuck down.</p>

The <strong>Dunning–Kruger effect</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis">hypothetical</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias">cognitive bias</a> stating that people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.</p>

        <p>He literally told me the same thing. That I’m making things up. Like people having long term side effects from the vaccine, in his eyes, it’s just made up. Saying vaccines are always safe and have been safe is made up. But okayy what do we know he’s a nurse he’s so smart. That’s why you’re a fucking nurse not a doctor. Dumb ass Mf.</p>

<p>​Idk if that’s some “cool” movie quote and I really don’t care. I don’t understand wtf your problem is, but I can tell you just like to fuck with people online. In real life you’re probably a little whiny adult baby, who cries when you tell em to stfu. I wasn’t even talking to you, yet you included yourself into this convo. Clear signs of adhd.

        <p>Lol, you should do well not to disparage nurses. Maybe in a nursing home that’s what I would do, but definitely not in an emergency room. I order medicine and testing. I’ve caught more mistakes than your previously beholden doctors can even count. I’m not acting as a physician at all. I am well within my scope woman. All doctors do is give orders, ask any of them, we’re the ones performing the life saving measures in most circumstances. Even intubation is often done by a respiratory therapist. Another lowly position in your eyes, I’m sure. Also also, ALL physicians would agree with my stance as it is not radical and backed by statistics, so there isn’t even a need for comparison. You seem angry, you should get some sleep. </p>
<p>Lastly, knowledge is not what leads to a higher paying job necessarily. If you were smart you’d know this.</p>

        <p>Yes it can. Knowledge and being smart leads to getting into a good college = better paying job, which I have done. Also I live in germany, it’s daytime and I’m not angry. Without the orders from a doctor, who went to college for YEARS, you wouldn’t even know what to do. Like I said you’re just an order follower.</p>

        <p>Most dumbest. Lol. Obviously knowledge CAN lead to those things. But one, it doesn’t necessarily lead to a better paying job. Consequently, someone can be dumb as a box of rocks and still find good paying job. I can think of at least one example of this. You do realize nurses go to school for YEARS as well, and continue their education long afterwards. I don’t know everything, but I do know about Covid, because I put my ass on the line just to have dumb entitled bitches tell me I’m a nothing.  If you truly only recognize a successful person by their salary, you are more shallow than the water in my toilet. You also seemingly do not take the time to read my response to the fullest because you continually bring up points that were already addressed. A symptom of entitlement to be sure</p>

        <p>1-HIV is not an airborne virus so masks aren't needed, and 2- the mask doesn't stop the virus as a virus particle itself cannot travel through air without being propelled so it stops the droplets which contain the virus particles.</p>

        <p>1.) So just fuck everyone who has died and those living who have a higher chance of dying? 
2.) You fucking numbskull, masks don't protect against an STI, that's not how it fucking works. This is a respiratory disease you donut.
3.) The virus is spread through droplets, which research has shown is significantly less of a problem as long as people contain it behind a mask, and ideally socially distance themselves to contain the droplets in the first place. As if the fucking virus will crawl through the mask and spread its wings, is that right you nimrod?</p>

        <p>Florida has been a covid hotspot, I'm not sure what you're saying. The masks have been shown to have a major effect (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7007e1.htm?s_cid=mm7007e1_x) on slowing the spread. Oh and by the way I did like just a few minutes research on that "study" you linked, and that organization is shady, with no transparency and no names behind the "research". They literally used to be called "Swiss PROPOGANDA Research" i.e. they have no interest in real science, just an agenda. Trusted universities and professors have condemned this website, which mind you has only sprung up in 2016. A website that is conspiring to shut down propoganda is feeding you propoganda and it is dangerous. I wish more people could actually differentiate between good sources and straight up bullshit meant to provide people their confirmation bias. I apologise for the attacks, but when you compare AIDS--which has also been thoroughly researched and is also treated and you learn about in middle school--to covid, it drives any sound mind nuts. Why do you think the AIDS epidemic is not still rampant like in 2006? Because we listen to science. So come on big boy, take a few harsh words because how else am I going to drive forward the fact that you have nothing and you are contributing to a massive problem by not doing your research?</p>

        <p>It's really not. The deaths are what matter and Florida has one of the lowest ratios. I'd also point you to Texas, another state doing very well. They don't have a mask mandate and they also don't have lockdown on. Let's look at the states doing badly. Hm, oh, California, Michigan and New York. What do they have? Strict lockdowns and mask mandates. Also, the CDC and Fauci are known to have flip-flopped a lot on all of this shit. Fauci at first said that lockdowns and masks didn't work. Now he's saying you have to wear two masks. Basically, he's shit at his job and should be removed. They also get most of their guidelines from the WHO who are proven to be in China and Winnie the Pooh's pocket</p>

        <p>They do too but not as much as the deaths. It's why the vulnerable in Florida were separated from the healthy. How can they be trusted? The CDC takes advice for the WHO who are in China's pocket right now. If you don't understand how much of a danger that is, you need to look up what they've been doing</p>

        <p>You mean this research?</p>
<p>&rt;The existing scientific evidences challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death. Governments, policy makers and health organizations should utilize prosper and scientific evidence-based approach with respect to wearing facemasks, when the latter is considered as preventive intervention for public health</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/</p>
<p>&rt; the mean percentage reduction in R (with 95% credible interval) associated with each NPI is as follows (Figure 3): mandating mask-wearing in (some) public spaces: −1%</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20116129v4.full-text</p>
<p>&rt; There is low certainty evidence from nine trials (3507 participants) that wearing a mask may make little or no difference to the outcome of influenza‐like illness (ILI) compared to not wearing a mask (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.18. There is moderate certainty evidence that wearing a mask probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory‐confirmed influenza compared to not wearing a mask (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.26; 6 trials; 3005 participants).</p>
<p>https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/full</p>
<p>&rt; We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50).</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</p>
<p>&rt; the World Health Organization (WHO) states that “at present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on COVID-19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID-19”</p>
<p>&rt; Randomised trials from community settings indicate a small protective effect. Laboratory studies indicate a larger effect when facemasks are used by asymptomatic but contagious individuals to prevent the spread of virus to others, compared to use by uninfected individuals to prevent themselves from becoming infected. Because incorrect use of medical facemasks limits their effectiveness, countrywide training programmes adapted to a variety of audiences would be needed to ensure the effectiveness of medical facemasks for reducing the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt; Non-medical facemasks include a variety of products. There is no reliable evidence of the effectiveness of non-medical facemasks in community settings.</p>
<p>&rt; The undesirable effects of facemasks include the risks of incorrect use, a false sense of security (leading to relaxation of other interventions), and contamination of masks. In addition, some people experience problems breathing, discomfort, and problems with communication. The proportion of people who experience these undesirable effects is uncertain. However, with a low prevalence of COVID-19, the number of people who experience undesirable effects is likely to be much larger than the number of infections prevented.</p>
<p>https://www.fhi.no/globalassets/dokumenterfiler/rapporter/2020/should-individuals-in-the-community-without-respiratory-symptoms-wear-facemasks-to-reduce-the-spread-of-covid-19-report-2020.pdf</p>
<p>&rt; The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.</p>
<p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<p>&rt; This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection</p>
<p>https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</p>
<p>&rt; This recent crop of trials added 9,112 participants to the total randomised denominator of 13,259 and showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.</p>
<p>&rt; Only one randomised trial (n=569) included cloth masks. This trial found ILI rates were 13 times higher in Vietnamese hospital workers allocated to cloth masks compared to medical/surgical masks, RR 13.25, (95%CI 1.74 to 100.97) and over three times higher when compared to no masks, RR 3.49 (95%CI 1.00 to 12.17).</p>
<p>&rt; However, recent reviews using lower quality evidence found masks to be effective. Whilst also recommending robust randomised trials to inform the evidence for these interventions.</p>

<p>Wrong. Phase 3 and 4 trials for ALL these "vaccines" were skipped before they started injecting the general public.</p>
<p>That's why they had to foist it on people with "Emergency Use Authorization."</p>
<p>&rt;i don’t get how it’s experimental. rna technology has been researched for 30 years.</p>
<p>Sure, it's been RESEARCHED, but not one single mRNA "vaccine" HAS EVER PASSED CLINICAL TRIALS EVEN ON ANIMALS.</p>
<p>They aren't real vaccines at all. They do not use attenuated virus, nor do mRNA "vaccines" produce the same antibodies as actual vaccines. They also do nothing to help with T cell immunity.</p>
<p>But the big reason they have failed all trials is a huge problem with Antibody-Dependent Enhancement, meaning that test subjects have a very high rate of death when exposed to the actual virus.</p>
<p>That's why we see so many otherwise healthy people dying right after these "vaccines" whereas the average age of covid "victims" is OLDER than life expectancy.</p>

        <p>I'm not against anyone else getting vaccinated. In my case i'm comfortable with the very small risk applicable to me.</p>
<p>I've had vaccines in the past. Got some in high school.</p>
<p>The arguement that i'm selfish doesn't seem correct, since other people can: wear a mask, socially distance, get the vaccine etc if they want to. I'm not responsible for the health of other people.</p>

        <p>Needles don't bother me at all. My blood is a goldmine for doctors an scientists. I have done volunteer experimental medication trials for my condition before as well. The only difference is that there was a contract, full disclosure, I got paid good cash, and I was able withdraw after I noticed some discomfort in side effects from the placebos they were testing. </p>
<p>One time I had a biopsy I asked if I could watched, so the doctors got a mirror and placed it by the incision as they preformed it. The entire time watching I was cracking jokes with them about the blood and gore, it was messy. They told me I was one of their best patients, and they wished more people would be a better sport about it like me. I have also woken up in the middle of surgery before, so don't try and push that "afraid of needles" bs on me. It won't work.</p>
