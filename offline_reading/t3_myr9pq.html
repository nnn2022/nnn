        <p>A mountain of evidence is emerging which indicates that something  very SINISTER is happening to the lost souls who've received the  Covid-JAB. There are now multiple reports from Medical Professionals and  Whistleblowers that there is now a very strong indication that the  vaccinated are shedding spike proteins that attack ACE2 receptor cells  which are found in both a woman's placenta and a Man's testes. What's  worse, this seems to be affecting not only the vaccinated, but also  unvaccinated people who are unfortunate enough to have come into close  proximity with someone whose been jabbed.</p>
<p>Since this video from Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson was streamed on April  20th, the evidence has increased exponentially. Having heard first-hand  testimony from women that are experiencing this nightmare, I can only  conclude that this is very real. On it's face, it's hard to see this as  anything less than a planned eugenics program that has been intended to  sterilize the human race.</p>
<p>The EVIL exhibited by the sociopaths behind this Covid-Crime Against  Humanity is staggering. They are striving for a planetary Genocide the  likes of which the world has never seen.</p>
<p>Please help to get this information out to as many as possible.  People don't know the dangers that they're facing. Difficult decisions  must be made, so this information can save lives.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry, but I’m calling bullshit on this. How the fuck can someone possibly get infected from a spike protein? I mean, that’s pretty flippin absurd. Can you show me a study that proves they exist, and that they can somehow magically infect someone? Bet you can’t.</p>

        <p>Well CRISPR and now more specific gene editing tools use viruses to essentially insert the new information. I'm certainly not saying this is definitely what is happening, just saying that it's a possibility is all.</p>
<p>In the same way that maybe expected vaccine hesitancy might actually be a means of wiping out those who don't trust the system by having COVID-19 do the initial damage which a vaccine essentially undoes? Who knows at this point.</p>
