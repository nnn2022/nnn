    <strong>Does seeing mask wearing make anyone else genuinely uncomfortable?</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t know, but every time I see someone wearing a mask out in public it genuinely creeps me out and makes me want to keep my distance. It didn’t help that I already found masks kinda creepy before this all happened, but now I just find them outright disturbing.</p>
<p>Earlier today I went to the grocery store to get a few things but more than half of the shoppers there were wearing masks and I felt uncomfortable as fuck in the store, I just wanted to get what I needed and quickly leave ASAP.</p>
<p>I hate masks. I really fucking hate masks. And I didn’t always feel this way either, back before the lockdowns began and people started to go hysteria mode I actually found it to be kind of hilarious and I joked about it. Then the lockdowns began and it stopped being funny.</p>
<p>Now they just disturb me and creep me the fuck out to the point I need to glance away when I see someone wearing one and I feel fucking uncomfortable in a place with a lot of mask-wearers.</p>
<p>I don’t know what it is about the masks that puts me off so much. It could be the dystopian symbolism and implications of the masks as the “new normal”, it could be because every time I see a mask I see someone who likely supported the oppressive lockdowns which damaged me and so many people, or it could be that when I see them I see how paranoia and hysteria have been successfully poisoned the mind of the wearer.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly what it is about them, but I just know I outright fucking hate hate hate HATE masks, and I hate seeing them. They just make me feel uncomfortable and I hate how people are trying to normalize them or make them a permanent part of our culture going forward.</p>
<p>It’s creepy. It’s disturbing. I hate it.</p>
<p>Does anyone else feel this way?</p></p>

        <p>I pretty much agree; masks are a symbol of the collective hivemind that permits authoritarian overreach. People don't even question if they work or not, they just do it because CNN told them to. </p>
<p>Also, the country's divided enough as it is. Looking to the future, the masks creep me out because they represent further polarization of the left and right.</p>

        <p>At this point the left and right both are just two roads that essentially converge at the same, authoritarian, place.</p>
<p>This is coming from someone who’s always held, and still holds, liberal values with anti-authoritarian tendencies. I used to be able to say I ticked a little left on the left-right scale, now I just look at it and go “uhhhhhhhhh?”</p>

        <p>This is why the back and forth elections of conservative then liberals then conservative, etc keep our country in balance.  If we ever allow one side to win more than one additional incumbent election,  we will slide too far in one direction pretty quickly. However,  if we allow a "progressive" as they are defined by the new left to win at all I think its going to be straight to authoritarianism in a single term. I fear this new left</p>

        <p>It would be nice if we had some more middle of the road politicians, like right-leaning Democrats or left-leaning Republicans. But these days, politics have more of an "us vs. them" mentality you'd more associate with sports; and a lot of the policies seem less about "what's in peoples' best interest" and more in "screw over people from the other party".</p>

        <p>That's no lie, dmreif.  This kind of darwinian "us vs. them" mentality, however, has been in existence for over 50 years, and it's not going to go away soon, unfortunately.  It's not gone away, and, if anything, it's gotten way worse.</p>

        <p>Even that’s a problem because that makes election patterns predictable making it easy to play both sides.</p>
<p>The real answer is gutting the parties and replacing them with people who give a damn. Trump pretty much gutted the Republicans and replaced them with honest conservatives (as much as I dislike Trump I recognize him gutting the Republican Party needed to happen), now we just need someone to come along and gut the Democrats in a similar fashion and replace them with honest liberals.</p>

        <p>Completely agree.  People just do what the media tells them to do.  If the media announced that the virus is now over and everyone can resume normal life, people would do exactly that without thinking twice about "safety".   It's pretty sad.  I mean, we saw that with the different protest situations.</p>

        <p>Come on now!   It's been found that wearing masks while out in public and social distancing do work at controlling the spread of the Covid-19 virus.  As long as this pandemic is as out of control as it is, due to lots of reckless people who really don't give a shit about other people and who are refusing to wear masks and social distance, the spread of disease will not be controlled.  There's been an unnecessary amount of lives lost as a result, and it's really disgusting.</p>

        <p>You have a right to think that, but it's really not worth shaming people who question masks, especially when scientists don't really know if everything about that is true. It's just the best evidence that we're working with.  And also, you do realize that even in Asian countries where they have already been a large part of social and cultural norms, Covid-19 continues to spread, just not as quickly. They're basically in a deadlock.  This is likely just inevitable since Sars-Cov-2 can spread in the upper respiratory tract so easily</p>

        <p>I stand by what I've said about mask-wearing and social distancing helping to control the spread of disease, especially something like Covid-19, which is a hell of a lot deadlier and more contagious than the seasonal flu(s) that hit us every fall and winter.  The Covid-19 virus can be transferred from person to person via speaking, singing, yelling and breathing, and the masks are not perfect, but droplets from the mouth and nose travel far less of a distance than they do between two people who are a few feet away from each other.  Don't kid yourself.</p>

        <p>Same here.  I hate masks and I hate seeing other people wearing them, especially the reporters on the news.  They're really trying to normalize this and I can't deal with that.  I think it is the dystopian symbolism that gets to me the most.  People are like robots, you can't read facial expressions or tell what others are thinking.  It's weird, it's creepy, and I'm ready for this all to end.</p>

        <p>I hate them, but my state is mandating their use in stores so everybody is forced to wear them. Even in public, including outdoors, the majority is wearing masks. It really bewilders me because it's getting very hot, while it bothers me, everybody else seems perfectly content and comfortable in theirs (ex: I'm the only one fidgeting with my mask anymore, everyone else doesn't).</p>

        <p>The odd thing is that so far, even during the lockdown, mask usage in my area has been rather low (I’d say less than 35%). Yet my area didn’t see some doom surge in COVID like the media loved to peddle.</p>
<p>I also live in WI where lockdown was completely lifted in most places including my area (north central WI). No doom surge there either.</p>
<p>Given all this it hit me as a complete “what the fuck” moment to suddenly see a shitload of masks in one spot and weirded me the fuck out. It could very well just be a coincidence, be that store in particular, or some weird time of day, but part of me is hoping there’s not caving to the “new normal” happening under my nose.</p>

        <p>I'm always fidgeting with my mask.  I lower it beneath my nose, so that I can breathe better and then sometimes lift it up slightly.  I'm in LA where it's required and it's strange to me how some people have the mask practically up to their eyeballs.  I don't get how they can tolerate it, especially during this heat.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, however, lowering the mask down below your nose, and therefore just having your mouth covered is really <strong>not</strong> sufficient.   I admit that I'm not as comfortable as can be wearing a mask when I go out in public, and even into the common areas of my building, especially in the hot humid weather,  or maintaining the minimal 6-foot social distancing, both of which are required here in the Bay State, and in my city of Residence.  However, I just wear the mask when I go out in public, even when I'm just out for a walk, and figure that it's better to avoid either infecting others with Covid-19, if I have it, and infecting oneself through others.</p>

        <p>Yes it's the same here in Kauai county - masks required for the store and no one seems to mind them, however I do wonder if it is a case of everyone /else/ thinking the same thing - e.g. what if others are also thinking that I seem comfortable and fine with my mask on?</p>

        <p>Resist.  Wear it around your chin if you can't get away with taking it off once inside the store.  It takes 10x more effort to enforce mask compliance than it does to "accidentally" leave it pulled down all the time.</p>

        <p>Sorry, Geek-the-Mage, but that's <strong>absolutely and totally</strong> beyond stupid--<strong>and</strong> irresponsible, especially when we're all in the middle of a deadly pandemic throughout the country right now.  Mask wearing and social distancing rules are in place for a damned good reason:  To protect oneself, as well as other people, from getting infected by the Covid-19 virus, which is much more deadly and much more contagious than the seasonal flu(s) that hit us every fall and winter.</p>

        <p>Yep. And now of course every woke-ass commercial has to be showing workers in masks. Not to mention people wearing masks walking by themselves in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and while driving.</p>
<p>The obsession with this virus is just straight creepy. A few minutes ago I commented in another internet forum which had nothing to do with coronavirus, and one guy said "if people forget about the virus in a month, the virus will be worse in the Winter than it was in March"</p>
<p>It's fucking creepy. Our species has truly devolved. Also, I fucking loathe masks too.</p>

        <p>Yes, I saw a few people on my social media who did those type of profile pics, some even with their kids and I’m just like, wtf is wrong with you??!  Like, you seriously think this is a good look or something to show off?  No wonder we are unable to get rid of this mask mandate.  Too many people are not only complying, but seem to think it’s a cool fashion statement.</p>

        <p>This is what worries me the most, as well.  It does seem that they want us to accept that masks are just going to be a part of our lives permanently.  I remember the days just a few months ago when we all would have looked at someone strangely if they were wearing a mask.  Now, if you're not wearing a mask, people freak.  It's insane.</p>

        <p>It’s because with the rise of social media people have become concerned with the collective prospect of “doing the right thing” because it’s trendy, they think they are “doing the right thing and saving lives” because of what the twitter hivemind has promoted for the past 3 months. It’s all for social brownie points (AKA likes and retweets).</p>

        <p>My mother-in-law did this. A couple month ago, both her and my mother were like "oMg We NeEd MaSkS" and I suggested scarves or bandanas. My mom said nevermind, she'd get some masks from my sister-in-law who's a nurse, then she got over the mask thing. My mother-in-law, on the other hand, immediately gave my husband and I some money to go buy scarves or bandanas. In the meantime, I made the mistake of letting her borrow one of my bandanas. She immediately put it on and took a selfie to post on Facebook.</p>

        <p>It's not an obsession when we're in the middle of a pandemic, because the Covid-19 virus is not just a bad case of the flu(s) that hit us every fall and winter.  It's far more deadly and far more contagious, and the purpose of wearing masks and social distancing is to control the spread of disease, and they've worked.  The people who don't abide by these rules are endangering themselves, as well as others.  Moreover, anybody of any age can develop a nasty enough case of the Covid-19 virus to die from it, or even remain permanently incapacitated in some way by it, because the Covid-19 virus kills off the lung tissue permanently.  </p>
<p>I'm not as comfortable as can be in a mask either, but I don't wish to put myself or others at risk for getting infected with the Covid-19 virus, so I wear it whenever I go out in public, even if it's only for a walk.</p>

        <p>Hey, dipshit!  Try to remember that the rules for mask wearing and social distancing are there for a damned good and legitimate reason.  I couldn't give less of a shit if you come down with Covid-19!  I care that people like you will take others with them.  I stand by my rights to go out and keep busy, and yet, unlike you and tons of other people, I have the good common sense and decency to wear a mask, and keep my distance from other people.  The people who don't wear masks, let alone social distance, and insist on having large gatherings of people are people who're putting others, as well as themselves at risk.</p>

        <p>Why are you trying to bully people into accepting masks? Just saying, even if it is necessary for the pandemic, that doesn't mean we don't have a right to talk about how genuinely creepy it is to see everyone in masks.  Faces are a HUGE part of our lives and yet masking hides all that.  I get it, wear it in the midst of the pandemic but with literally no end date to this, it might as well be forever.  I get it, right now the virus is dangerous, but we have no proof this won't be forever. And having to wear masks forever is honestly a scary implication if you really think about it. Read this before you bully people about masks. Because just like you're scared of the virus spreading more quickly and vigorously, many others are also scared of losing such a large part of what it truly means to be human.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to bully anybody into wearing masks.  These people who refuse to wear masks and to social distance either don't realize, or don't care that they're putting others, as well as themselves at risk by not wearing masks and social distancing.  The people who are so insistent on flaunting the rules of mask-wearing and social distancing, and the rules against having large gatherings of people are why the Covid-19 pandemic is so out of control here in the United States right now.</p>
<p>I honestly don't feel creeped out by people wearing masks.  In fact, I think it's kind of interesting, and, imho, it doesn't make people look inhuman, at all.</p>

        <p>Then why did you call someone dipshit? It is so biased and closed-minded of you. And not to mention, you can't just pinpoint the spread of the virus in the US to the lack of masks. Science needs to still catch up. Now sure, there is rising evidence of the masks bringing the spread of Covid more "under control" as we say, but that's not the goal we want. We want for the pandemic to end, but even if you look at many Asian countries where they're really strict about masks in their culture, the masks primarily keep the virus from spiraling out of control, but after a certain point they don't help with getting the cases down real low.  You need people to stay at home to do that.  But of course, the economy. Thing is, this virus is not containable. It's just the nature of it and all other pathogens that spread through the upper respiratory system. The original Sars-Cov virus in 2003 wasn't like that, so that's why they could contain it. I'm not saying break the rules. I'm just saying there are multiple sides to consider when scientists are still trying to understand the virus, and shaming others is not worth it. A lotta people cannot relate to the idea that masks don't make people look inhuman.</p>

        <p>I disagree with you, Own-Philosopher7558.  I called them dipshit because they were clearly being willfully ignorant and stupid about why people have to wear masks when out in public, and social distance from each other.  I'm sorry to disabuse you of your ideas, Own-Philosopher7558, but the wearing of masks that cover both the mouth and the nose, as well as social distancing have been proven to work at controlling the spread of this horrid Covid-19 virus, which is a hell of a lot deadlier and more contagious than the seasonal flu(s) that hit us every fall and winter.  A lot of these people are young, but old enough to know better.  Again, sorry to disabuse you of your notions that violating the rules for mask-wearing in public and social distancing and the rule against large gatherings of people in one place, especially indoors, and/or without masks doesn't cause the Covid-19 pandemic to go out of control, but the fact that so many people ARE violating these rules is precisely the reason that the Covid-19 pandemic is so out of control here in the United States right now.</p>

        <p>But see, that's where I and probably most others disagree.  You are trying to justify your insult since you think they're "willfully ignorant and stupid".  That is really not true.  They understand and know better like you said, but masks and social distancing is unnatural and dehumanizing.  It is not stupidity. It's just humans being humans. And no, neither of us have proof that you are correct</p>

        <p>Again, I disagree wit you, Own-Philosophy7558.  Nobody I know likes having to wear masks that cover both the mouth and the nose, and to social distance.  It's something that is absolutely necessary and it's been proven that wearing masks and social distancing does help slow the spread of disease.  You and I disagree on this--that much is true.  Therefore, I stand by what I've said, and my opinion that it's very irresponsible to violate rules for mask wearing and social distancing, and against having large gatherings of people, especially indoors.  No matter how unnatural it may seem, it's got to be done.</p>

        <p>yeah it makes me sick to see people in masks because it's nothing more than street theater. most of them are playing their very important roles in all this. if not for the actors, this hoax wouldnt have been sustainable. if you see someone in a mask and it creeps you out, it's because your subconscious recognizes them as someone who's being deceptive in their nature. people who are actually scared of covid aren't out and about on the streets wearing masks. they're at home having their groceries delivered and refusing to see other people. these people wearing masks outside arent actually worried about getting sick--they wouldnt be strolling around outside if that were the case. if you see people doing recreational things outside while wearing a mask, i can guarantee you it's an actor who knows damn well that covid isnt real. these actors are ALL OVER THE PLACE. in your neighborhoods &amp; working at your stores.</p>

        <p>I strenuously disagree with the notion that the masks are nothing more than street theatre, as well as the notion that the people who walk outside and do recreational sports or whatever are just actors/actresses.  The people who are complying with the rules for mask-wearing and social distancing while out in public, no matter what they're doing, are complying with those rules, because they're being considerate, decent and responsible people who want to protect others, as well as themselves, from this deadly Covid-19 virus, which has already unnecessarily claimed over 170, 000 lives here in the United States.</p>

        <p>Call  mask-wearing what you will, gatorquake, but it's necessary, given the fact that we're in the middle of a pandemic, which is partly caused by Donald Trump deliberately calling the Covid-19 pandemic a hoax and lying to the American people when he said that it was under control.  Donald Trump knew about it last December and in January, and refused to do anything about it back then, when it was relatively easy to contain and control.  </p>
<p>By refusing to wear masks or social distance when out in public, people put both themselves and others at risk for Covid-19.  The people who flout these rules don't give a shit who they sicken and/or kill, and <strong>that's</strong> disgusting, to me.</p>

        <p>I drive to a more rural area to do my shopping. Nobody wears a mask there, and if they do, it usually says "DUMP CUOMO", so its less dystopian. Sorta.</p>

        <p>Yes I feel the same way. Masks take away humanity, we emote and socialize by facial expressions for a good majority of communication. I am a little hard of hearing, so I need to read lips and when I am trying to talk to individuals who are wearing masks, it is hard for me. Then they get mad at me for repeating themselves.</p>

        <p>That’s terrible. Sounds very frustrating. I feel like I am having to say “what was that?” half the damn time too and I’m not hard of hearing. It’s just impossible to make out what people are saying behind these damn things.</p>

        <p>Frankly, I not only disagree with the notion that masks take away humanity,  but I'd much rather wear my mask and look a little weird to other people than to risk contracting Covid-19 myself, and/or infecting other people.  I don't care what others think.  I'll wear masks out in public, even when out for a walk, as long as this pandemic is going on.</p>

        <p>I'm having the same problem. I was crying a lot this week because Catholic churches in my area are reopening for Masses this weekend, which is supposed to be a good thing, but naturally, they're requiring masks. I was in tears because the thought of going to CHURCH of all places and having to sit and receive communion socially distanced, see the priest in a mask, see everyone else in a mask...I'm not ready to do it. It made me sick just thinking about it.</p>
<p>My company is also requiring masks for everyone who can't work from home and has to be in the office. They also want us to wear masks and gloves at all times when they fully reopen next year (unless you're alone in a closed door room), along with things like not having your own permanent workspace, having designated walkways in the hall and not having the break area/convenience market open. I have the same feelings of dread about seeing everyone at my office in a mask too. My job can be done from home just fine anyway, and I'd so much rather be remote than look at my coworkers behind masks all day and feel too freaked out to work. I will also quit my side job (baseball team) if they return to business next season and I'm required to wear a mask. Since we're not even working/playing this year, there's nothing to worry about in that vein at the moment, but I won't spend summer 2021 hiding behind a mask because it will take away everything I enjoy about the job. </p>
<p>I know it's "selfish" to feel this way according to the doomers, and I'm just supposed to "mask up" and be happy about it, but I can't do it. I tolerate it in Walmart or other retail, but it weirds me out to see EVERYONE forced to wear one. I wish it were a choice but in PA, it's required in every business.</p>

<p>Anytime I read arguments against mandatory masks, the issues are personal liberty, mental health, the arresting of our children's emotional development, important things that concern the population as a whole. </p>
<p>For all their posturing, the pro-lockdown-and-mask people's underlying message is all too clear: "I DON'T WANNA GET SICK!" They're the "selfish" ones, never forget that.</p>

        <p>Yeah I get it.  I don't have as extreme a reaction as OP, but there's something in the symbolism I don't like.  It resembles a muzzle, a symbol of submission.  I don't think it's a coincidence that society has popularized kneeling right afterwards.  Two submissive symbols in the name of morality.  My intuition tells me this just isn't right.</p>

        <p>The keeling has different origins which pre-date the current round of authoritarian and lockdown BS, I don’t think the two are related. At least the kneeling is voluntary, many places mandate masks.</p>

        <p>Yes. And I can't hear anyone who is wearing one. Not only do they seem to muffle voices, but apparently I depended on lip reading a lot more than I realized. And the ones I see advertises with clear panels are even creepier to me for some reason.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat as you. Wearing a mask makes me lightheaded and gives me headaches. It's just so hard to breathe and having my face covered makes me panic a little (I have anxiety). Also, it's super itchy and I'm constantly messing with it.</p>

        <p>If you have asthma, that's a whole other matter.  Then you're exempt from wearing one.  People who <strong>are</strong> able to wear masks are required to do so in order to protect themselves, as well as other people, especially those with asthma and other respiratory issues that make them even more vulnerable to the Covid-19 virus, from getting sick.  </p>
<p>Since I'm an adult over 65, that puts me in a higher risk group, despite being healthy, so I wear one whenever I go  out in public, and/or just out for a walk, but I wear a mask not only for my own protection, but for the protection of other people, especially ones who have asthma and/or other underlying medical conditions that make them even more susceptible to the Covid-19 virus.</p>

        <p>Too bad if it does get you pissed, 35739578345353!   I really don't have much sympathy for people who refuse to abide by the rules of mask-wearing and social distancing, because they clearly don't give a shit who they sicken or kill.  Moreover, Covid-19 is not only more deadly and more contagious, but a person can be asymptomatic, still be infected, and still be capable of spreading this virus.</p>

        <p>They're dystopian and depressing. They make you feel and look less human. They make it hard to breath and even see your surroundings properly. Unfortunately, they're mandatory in stores and public transportation where I live, so I have no choice. Thankfully, almost no one wears them outside, where they don't have to. When I wait at the tram stop or train station, 90% of the people seem to wait until it's absolutely necessary before putting them on. You always get the occasional militant WHO groupie, yelling about "distance!" to her kids or lecturing\giving dirty looks to strangers (ugh, this type is so unbearable), but I feel like the silent majority is sick of this nonsense and is ready to move on.</p>

        <p>I have no objection to them -- as long as they aren't mandated and wearers acknowledge that there's no proven benefit to them outside the health care context. I am fine with people who want to wear a mask because they don't see any harm in it and think there might be some potential benefit. I am even ok with requiring them in certain limited situations, like in crowded subway trains. (Who knows how NYC might have turned out if there had been more hand washing and mask wearing on public transit.)</p>
<p>What I can't stand is the sanctimonious attitude of many mask-wearers that those who don't wear them are somehow morally or intellectually defective. I've studied the subject and have reached an informed opinion. I've also had Covid and so can't catch or transmit it; as a result even if masks were effective in general, my wearing one wouldn't benefit me or anyone else. The last point applies to tens of millions of  Americans and is almost never mentioned.</p>

        <p>It's weird. I look at a lot of Japanese street fashion pics and used to wish I could occasionally wear a mask without people being uncomfortable around me. But given the reason we started wearing the masks, plus the way it has played out here, it doesn't seem very desirable anymore. However, I don't think looking at those pictures from Japan will seem any different than before.</p>

        <p>I feel that way. It's a hot sunny day in London and still people are wearing masks.</p>
<p>When it's an old/frail person it doesn't bother me, the fear campaign was really powerful and I can't blame vulnerable people for falling for it but there are healthy young guys walking around in masks and I litereally laugh in their face. Why are they, a fucking dog who can't think for himself who has to put a muzzle on? I'm just so confused as to how some people are still buying into the bullshit.</p>
<p>Anyway, starting Monday, I will be wearing a mask 10 hours a day including public transport and a full day at work. This might be my last week in that job.</p>

        <p>Meh. I don’t find it creepy because I don’t scare easily  like these virtue signalling pussies. That being said, it annoys me because of the implications.</p>
<p>They’ve already forced masks onto the subway here staring in July and I’m worried they’re trying to normalize masks so they can start boiling a frog and introduce mandatory mask laws everywhere.</p>
<p>Also hear losers need to stop littering their masks everywhere.</p>

        <p>It absolutely creeps me the fuck out. I don't know what kind of normal person could look around at a room full of masked strangers, including children, and think that felt in any way "normal" or okay. </p>
<p>That being said, I refuse to wear anything that actually resembles a mask. I go for more of the bank robber look with a bandana or scarf across my face. I am forced to wear the covering when shopping in Los Angeles County since we are still one of the last idiotic counties to be enforcing this bullshit. </p>
<p>Here is a sampling of idiocy I observed while out running errands today: </p>
<p>Grocery store encounter (Pasadena, CA) - I ask the clerk if the face mask rule is still being enforced because I noticed they no longer had a sign outside. She assures me it is still in force and says they will not serve anyone not wearing a mask. As she says this, she observes a man walking towards the exit removing his mask (he is nearly halfway outside) and proceeds to chastise him for removing his mask even though he is headed to the parking lot and fresh air. </p>
<p>I pass several grocery stores in my immediate neighborhood - All lines are 10+ people deep of masked zombies waiting to be let inside. I have yet to stand in one of these idiotic lines and just shop in neighboring cities now. There are ways around the idiocy. </p>
<p>I pass a peaceful protest of about 30 or so people - everyone is pretty well socially distanced and despite being outdoors, 100% of them are wearing masks as they wave their fists and hoist there signs in solidarity with George Floyd and BLM. </p>
<p>While driving, I observe that 90% of people driving ALONE on the road, some even with the windows rolled down, are seen driving with masks on. WTF do they think they are protecting themselves from?! This particular look of the masked zombies behind the wheel is horror movie creepy to me. </p>
<p>Another grocery store (Glendale, CA) - More masks but here most people aren't even bothering to wear them correctly. Most have them down below their noses or even their chins. Brilliant. No one enforces it. They just want to see that you've complied. Utter idiocy. </p>
<p>The Water store - they have the entire front entrance blocked off so that no one can enter.  You must place your water jug on a cart at the door, stay 6 feet away from everyone (no one is in line), wear a mask, and the person serving me is wearing a mask and plastic gloves to fill up my water jug. "NO MASK, NO SERVICE" is plastered on the shop windows. There are more reminders inside the store that say "6 feet away" with arrows pointing out, though I don't know why since they haven't let anyone inside for months now. He handles both my water jug and my cash with the same gloves. </p>
<p>All in all, absolutely nothing has changed in Los Angeles in the 3+ months of this lockdown. If anything, shit has gotten more absurd and people seem more and more apt to accept this dystopia as the "new normal". Can't wait to get the fuck out. L.A. has lost its goddamn mind.</p>

        <p>No trolling actually. Just trying to understand other perspectives. apparently mask wearing is a very traumatizing experience for a lot of people including yourself based on your "picture of daily life". I'm so sorry you have to go through it.</p>

        <p>It <em>should</em> make you uncomfortable. Our brains are highly tuned to evaluate other people's expressions in order to successfully cooperate, or, be wary.  Your brain is scanning for information it needs but can't get. Plus of course there's the historic use of masks to prevent identification when doing nefarious things such as robbery or lynching.</p>

        <p>I gotta give credit where credit is due: some of the designs on these new masks are quite artful and appeal to my girly little "oh pretty!" side. But you know how most people supposedly find pointy angular faces more intimidating than round faces? Yeah, I'm kinda the opposite. Something about how masks look when they cover the chin really creeps me out. So round, so small, like the person has no jaw. I'm also terrible at reading facial expressions on a good day, and it doesn't get any easier when I can't see the bottom half of someone's face.</p>
<p>I support the right to wear a mask, especially for privacy reasons. But I would much prefer people wear scarves and bandanas. They have more....texture. More....volume. They don't make the chin look so small and round, like the person is missing their mandible or something. I'm glad my mother-in-law's masks don't cover her chin. She's very gung-ho about masks, tries to get my husband and I to wear earloop masks instead of bandanas, always gushing about the cute new designs she found. Again, I do appreciate the artistry put into some masks. But it bothers me that some people are treating it like a fashion statement instead of the security theater it is.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I intended to do the same thing: wear colorful girly masks, scarves, or bandanas if they made it mandatory. Then my state made masks mandatory, and I decided to wear a simple.black bandana in mourning of our freedoms. Thankfully, I haven't actually had to wear it much, since most businesses here aren't really enforcing the mandate. Sometimes I wish my ideals didn't run so deep, so I can wear a bandana around my face and look like a little robber in a supermarket while I can.</p>
<p>My mother and brother won't let my niece go to the store with them because they don't want her to wear a mask. This is pleasantly surprising; I've often been at odds with my mom and brother, especially when it comes to government/corporate overreach, like that time my brother beat the holy hell out of me over an anarchist symbol on an album cover. Not sure what stores they've been going to though, because we go to the same stores and I haven't really been bothered for not wearing a mask. Maybe it depends on which "guard" is on duty. I fear for what might happen to my niece when she goes back to school, whether she'll be required to wear a mask or possibly something much worse.</p>
