        <p>It's not as deadly as you think.</p>
<p>It's simply stacked on top of other causes of death.</p>
<p>More people than usual die in pandemics, that's kind of the fundamental way we know we are in a pandemic.</p>
<p>The question is not "did more people die"</p>
<p>The questions is: are enough people dying to justify the violation of people's rights in an effort to supress a particular virus?</p>
<p>The answer for this is clearly no.</p>

        <p>For me? 10 million in a year globally At a minimum before they start restricting people's rights.</p>
<p>27 million people died of hart disease and cancer last year.</p>
<p>Of course you'd know that if you did your research.</p>
<p>18m from heart disease and 9 from cancer.</p>
<p>The kinds of restrictions we saw imposed globally shouldn't even be on the table with under 25 million deaths.</p>
<p>10m for basic things, 25m for serious violations like national lock downs etc.</p>
<p>For America? I would argue over 1m would have been needed to die in a single year to justify what we were seeing in some states.</p>
<p>In my country Canada? 150,000 at a minimum.</p>

        <p>Heart disease and cancer are not contagious. </p>
<p>You don’t think a million would have died in the US without the restrictions that were in place? Last year Dr. Doom and Gloom Fauci said worst case scenario w/ restrictions was 100-250k dead in the first year, those numbers look pretty quaint now.</p>

        <p>The fact that a non contagious chronic illness kills more people that your pandemic should literally be the only thing I have to say.</p>
<p>Covid would have had to have killed 10x more people to even come close to how many died of those two illnesses globally.</p>

        <p>I asked what someone’s hypothetical numbers requiring restrictions and precautions might be, you mention how many people die annually of unrelated, non-contagious health problems. You mention “mild disease” and compare to the 1918 pandemic, which occurred when we didn’t have antibiotics yet or even the basic understanding of how a virus spreads, so you seem happy to keep bringing up unrelated concepts for some reason.</p>
<p>If that flu were to happen now w/ modern medicine, it would probably be as “mild” as covid has been. Ditto if covid had hit in 1918, several million dead in a year. Everyone who has required ventilation or supplemental oxygen probably dies in that scenario.</p>
<p>I’ve been anti-lockdown from the start and believe there have been ways to help this problem without shutting down society and laying off workers etc, for the record. This ain’t “my” pandemic.</p>

        <p>Yes I admit the flu is deadly and kills tens of thousands of people each year in America alone. The question is, why did you do nothing about it? Why are you virtue signaling covid saying even if 1 life is saved it's worth it, but you never gave a shit about the flu deaths?</p>

        <p>It’s deadly to a certain demographic, a demographic that we could have easily protected without doing so much collateral damage. </p>
<p>80% of US deaths have occurred in the 65+ demographic. 1/3 of all US deaths occurred in skilled nursing facilities. </p>
<p>We could have kept the elderly and frail out of harms way while the young and healthy kept on about their lives. </p>
<p>Also, per CDC only 5.5% of covid deaths occurred with covid as the only diagnosis. The other 94.5% had 4+ co-morbidities. </p>
<p>So yes, covid has the potential to kill, but it isn’t as deadly as people would have you think it is. Context matters.</p>

        <p>Please indicate how many of these were caused by covid vs the drastic increases in lockdown caused deaths from everything from cancers, violent crime, substance abuse, etc. Site sources. Don't use pcr as an indication of a covid death, nor stats based on states "deaths from any cause within x days of a positive test" because those can't discriminate between deaths from, deaths with, or merely deaths near a test.</p>

        <p>My feeling the entire has been that sars-cov-2 is a worse than usual flu strain for those over 70.   It would be interesting to break that graph down into age groups.</p>
<p>The point is not whether or not 'covid' is deadly.   The point is that the reaction to it was over the top and used to benefit a very small number of people at the expense of millions.   And to set in motion a plan for changing how we all live without our consent.</p>

        <p>Well, part of the reason we have seen more deaths this year is that the past 2 years have seen a dramatic drop in winter time deaths. For some reason, I can not attach the CDC graph for deaths from the past 14 years, but there has been a drop. Those drops are what is called 'dry tinder'. (Not my term) That means that there are an above average amount of people who are at risk of dying, for even the smallest reason. If you look at the graph, there is only a slight increase in deaths. If someone can tell me how to attach the graph here, I would appreciate it.</p>

        <p>OP, here's the thing, have you paid attention to how COVID-19 is being diagnosed and how it is being marked on people's death certificates?</p>
<p>You control how you run the tests (rt-PCR), and you can easily control the figures. Based on what we know now, the rt-PCR test is not a infectious disease diagnosis tool. Who said that? Kary Mullis said that, the inventor. Also look at how deaths are being counted; it is not a coincidence that the seasonal influenza season has taken a back seat. In addition, you need ask how are these figures being counted.</p>
<p>People who late have stage cancer, lung diseases, are in hospices are being counted in some instances are dying from COVID-19. That should ring alarm bells!</p>

<li>Look at the proportional deaths reduced to other causes; flu, heart attacks, etc</li>
<li>People who can't get surgeries/treatments because of COVID political reasons at hospital</li>
<li>The control groups that Pzifer/moderna used did not include more than a few 80+ year olds, the ones they did were relatively healthy</li>
<li>If you have a positive case, within 60/90 days you are called 'covid death'; if you died of vaccine problems, it's attributed to other causes. Solicited symptoms were marked as stage 3/4 severity but dismissed, and the number of people that suffer from those are 5-20x  higher (stage 3/4 severity can be 'hard to breathe, high fever, intense sweating)</li>
<li>People suicided, people took opiods, people killed themselves from losing their jobs, spouses every lockdown</li>
<li>Just because 3 in 5 were infected in week 1 of vaccinated and unvaccinated population, and then 1 in 5 in vaccinated and unvaccinated population, you can't just call it an X% effective because both populations have a similar level of decreased risk of getting it, and getting symptoms; furthermore, people weren't vaccinated for the entire duration - later people are considered 'vaccinated' for only a few days so they have lower risks</li>
<li>Vaccinated people have shown to have an increased risk of catching covid before <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.21252652v1</a></li>
<li>They only count 'fully vaccinated' or 2+ dosed people, but the people who only took one dose because of a refusal of taking more doses, or those in worse conditions didn't count</li>
