    <strong>2021 is already making 2020 look like an absolute joke so far. What the hell is going on??</strong>
    <p><p>2021 is one of the strangest years ever (both good and bad), and I don't think I'll ever forget it, even years later. Almost nothing has made sense. Its only July and so far we've got:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UFOs and Aliens openly discussed in the news. What the fuck?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total global hysteria on an unprecedented scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>News feels like it has become parody, and so has real life. Literally an upside down planet at this point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scientists (especially Robert Malone in regards to mRNA) being shut down and erased from history, all in plain sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least 2020 had "we're all in this together" despite them being misled, but in 2021 its now "get the vax or lose your fucking job / rights" or straight up medical tyranny - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o7wq9l/the_best_vaccine_is_the_one_available_to_you_this/">example, a guy who got the AstraZeneca vaccine was STILL denied the privileges that the vaccinated were supposed to receive</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People have lost all common sense especially when it comes to risk assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Australia/Canada/UK has been absolutely unrecognizable (mostly). Thank fucking god the USA has the 2nd amendment which makes the United States the last to fall against a possible tyranny wave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fucking president of Haiti, a liberal democratic country not too far from the shores of the United States has been assassinated in cold blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to 2020, The elites have been much much more sloppy with their lies the last few months, when it comes to Covid rules. Openly broke their rules (Matt hancock, G7 summit) and yet ABSOLUTELY NO ONE EXCEPT CONSPIRACY THEORISTS ARE QUESTIONING THIS?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now some billionaires are prepared to go into space near the end of July, which conveniently has a great chance  for Project Bluebeam to actually happen. Along with UFO talk being openly discussed, Do they know something we don't? Are they conditioning the public to expect something like this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ohnhyz/today_is_the_first_full_day_of_the_new_world/">Fucking Australian news literally mentioned "NEW WORLD ORDER" on live TV, they didn't even try to hide it</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media bots on absolute overload ever since the 2020 United States presidential election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People losing all nuance. Anyone questioning whats going on, is labeled a Qanon moron that believes the earth is flat, and all discussion is instantly shut down or censored...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This would be the spark of a possible war.</strong> BETTER FUCKING HOPE THE VACCINES DON'T END UP BEING A PROBLEM. With growing civil unrest, along with people at their very limit, and seeing the vaccine as the way out, if it turns out that the vaccines are actually useless + possibly making the situation worse, i wouldn't be surprised if a war breaks out soon by November / December 2021 (dark winter, anyone?), especially after all the propaganda, censorship, gaslighting, along with constant tensions growing at an all time high.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOW ONTO THE "VIRUS FEARS" and other nonsense rules</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Knows if you're standing up or sitting down at a restaurant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows if you're in a restaurant before a curfew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows if you're in a store before a curfew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows the difference from a handshake and a fist bump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Super spreader" when protesting something politically incorrect, but apparently takes a vacation when you protest for the right cause. It's (D)ifferent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Peaceful" protests allowed, yet do other daily activities and the boogeyman Coronavirus comes out to exterminate you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must quarantine for some countries upon arrival even if vaccinated, yet all the world leaders broke their own covid rules 100% during the G7 Summit, but social distanced when the camera was on them, then went back to normal when the cameras were off. So it knows who are the rich and who are the plebs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only virus where a vaccine has to be 100% effective or else its unacceptable even if its 80-90%... nevermind the flu vaccine which ranges around 40-60%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only virus smart enough to rewrite the past and have every symptom as "long covid", ministry of truth style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knows when its lunch time, now you can take your masks off or any earlier would've ended up in a ventilator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cold/flu? what's that? I heard its only the delta variant now. Flu is so 2010s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only virus that managed to successfully and completely kill off common sense, even the more deadly ones failed at this. Brains over brawn!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each variant conveniently arrives as countries plan to reopen or when politicians get exposed. Corona to the rescue!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curfews can be set differently in different areas or different countries... huh? So man-made rules are what dictates the pattern of this particular virus in each respective area?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, come on! Almost NOTHING has made sense. What is going on?! And I'm not just referring to the hysteria around the virus, but the world in general feels like a radical transformation is ongoing. Movie event one after another in 2021...</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for this. Between working my job, losing my friends because they’re brainwashed, and trying to work and carry on like a normal person, I feel like I everyone I know has their head buried in the sand. To add to your list, I’d also mention the absolute mess of the financial markets (all red flags are pointing to crash) and the crazy inflation happening, I’d say you hit all the nails on the head. Oh, and the absolute moral deterioration of our society and indoctrination of our public education system.</p>

        <p>Yup. And the push for electric cars is in preparation for the petroleum extraction/refinement/distribution supply chain to break down. When that happens we’ll still have power grids, especially in coastal areas. That way the cloud people will still have vehicles.</p>

        <p>Sure. I learn a lot from r/conspiracy, and there is a lot of talk there about an upcoming financial collapse. Post links:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/jv8ere/the_next_false_flag_will_be_likely_a_cyberattack</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/od4an2/2021_financial_crash</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lilch6/rothschilds_courting_financial_collapse</p>
<p>It is related to a major cyberattack. The World Economic Forum's most recent event was Cyber Polygon. The event prior was Event 201, a "mock" pandemic. That event was in October 2019. So, it's widely expected that a real cyberattack will happen in a couple months.</p>
<p>Other related news includes Wells Fargo shuttering all personal lines of credit, a move that to me seems pretty shocking.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ogh7ne/in_regards_to_todays_announcement_that_wells</p>
<p>And, you've probably heard about Blackrock buying up homes.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nw3oq0/blackrock_are_still_buying_up_homes_to_rent_out</p>
<p>One possible answer to why they are buying property at inflated rates is that land/property is an asset that can withstand a financial crisis. Another reason is to further the "own nothing, be happy" agenda.</p>

        <p>TPTB know something, for sure. I figure it's either an upcoming natural disaster, or the singularity is coming sooner than expected. They are wanting to usher in the NWO as quickly as possible. They are desperate for us to take the vaccine. I believe there is something in the vaccine that will either sterilize us, alter our DNA to prepare for the microchips, or dose us with chemicals that make us less prone to question their motives.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I think the vaccines are mostly inert. They’re a symbol, a thing for the obedient people to support and the disobedient people to resist.  I think our side is being spooked with fear porn propaganda about these inert vaccines while the other side is being spooked by the Covid propaganda.</p>
<p>The whole point is to condition the public into compliance and to raise their animosity toward our side to the point of open violence.</p>

        <p>I don't know about strangeness. But I do know, that one year ago I was still quite OK compared to now. For me 2021 is worse than 2020 (except for December, which was by far the worst month of 2020 for me).</p>

        <p>Maybe, but I think that the recent news about aliens is just the first step of their next spyop. Like there's gonna be some alien invasion scare at some point and then we have to form a one world government and "unite" to fight the aliens or something xD</p>

        <p>I don't know a whole lot about the different requirements for travel, so I can't comment in that. I know Canada does still have some quarantine rules (pretty sure you have to pay for the government quarantine hotel). Mask mandates were lifted in most of Canada July 1st.</p>
