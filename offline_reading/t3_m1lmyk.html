    <strong>New ticketmaster survey being sent out regarding covid concerns.</strong>
    <p><p>The survey may be targeted, but I imagine a lot of others got it. Asks a series of questions on if certain ideas would make you more or less likely to go to live events. I'd highly recommend checking your ticketmaster email for it. Lots of concerning ideas in there (onsite/off-site covid testing requirements, vaccine passport requirements, masks at shows, social distancing etc). This type of survey should be telling on what the masses want and god I hope I don't have to get a covid test just to see a show. Fill it out if you're excited to get back to shows and don't want to deal with safety theater and even higher ticket prices as a result.</p></p>

        <p>Ugh I knew that people who were celebrating that they won the Ticketmaster vaccine thing were wrong. A part of me knows Iâ€™ll never see live music again and it makes me very sad. Iâ€™d only go if it was the same way it was in 2019.</p>

        <p>The local theater in my area sent out a similar email.  One of the 'ideas' they bandied about is whether the public would prefer <strong>the performers</strong> to wear masks.  I told them my wife and I would love to come back, but won't, until we don't have to wear a mask, at all.  I encourage everyone to let these places know how you feel.</p>

        <p>Damn I didnâ€™t get it even though I used to go to shows all the time. It was sad and surreal to see that my last email from them was a promotion for a Tool concert in September of 2019 (that I wasnâ€™t able to go to ðŸ˜ž)</p>

        <p>I am so thankful I went to both nights of that show when they were here. I had another ticket to see them in summer 2020, but that didn't pan out. </p>
<p>The survey has unique links so sharing it will do no good. Was sent around 709pm est from research@tickemaster.com if that helps any. I should have saved screenshots of the questions on this thing.</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s awesome. They are amazing live. I got to see NIN back to back in 2018 and they played a completely different set list each night.</p>
<p>Talking about this now is just making me depressed. Even though I wouldnâ€™t like it, I would be willing to wear a mask to see a band that I liked enough (although Iâ€™d blow it off once inside), but if they require the vaccine passports I might never be able to again</p>

        <p>We're into a lot of the same stuff! Loved that NIN tour. Saw them twice on that as well, hearing perfect drug live was an experience! </p>
<p>I hear ya though, it's so upsetting I haven't seen a show in over a year. Seeing an amazing show is like a religious experience to me and that's been taken away. My biggest fear of what's going to happen is shows will be another socioeconomic factor caused by all this. Ticketmaster sure isn't going to pay for covid tests. They're also going to jack up the prices if social distancing is required. Security guards who love harassing and bullying patrons will love the mask rules, it'll hide their identity giving them more power to get away with shit too (have heard countless stories of them molesting younger girls at security check points). Shows will be something only the wealthy are allowed to attend, I mean shit it was already heading down that direction anyway.</p>

<p>I think you are right about the social distancing requirements jacking up prices. Thatâ€™s something Iâ€™ve thought about too if they are going to allow concerts this summer.</p>
