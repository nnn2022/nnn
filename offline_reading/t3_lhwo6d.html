    <strong>To my brothers in Lockdown States. To the Future. To the Past. To a Time when Thought was Free...</strong>
    <p><p>For those of you who are scared of Covid and who are exhausted mentally because you live in a lockdown location, my heart goes out to you. I can't begin to imagine what life has been like for you this past year and I feel for you. </p>
<p>If all you know about Covid is what you hear on tv and you are not allowed to go outside to see if it's safe or not, then its only natural to fear the unknown and to fear the worst - especially when we keep hearing all those massive death counts. </p>
<p>I live in a FREE state (Florida) and I'm scared and exhausted too - but it's not Covid, I'm scared of (anymore) - it's the fact that those who have taken power seem to have us on <a href="https://theeagleswillfly.com/great-reset/">a course that leads to our doom</a>. </p>
<p>As far as Covid goes, perhaps <a href="https://thathelpfuldad.com/coronavirus-fear-lockdown/">this story can give you some hope.</a>  As for me, we've been living pretty freely in Florida since the summer. My kids have been in live school since Aug. We play live sports (basketball, football, soccer, baseball). I go to the crowded gym almost every day. We eat out as a family all the time. We visit with friends and family. We go to parties. I've been to events with 10,000 other people around. And, <a href="https://redstate.com/bonchie/2021/02/11/a-great-triggering-goes-forth-after-tom-brady-celebrates-his-super-bowl-win-n325230">just like Tom Brady</a>, <strong>99% of the time we do NOT wear masks</strong>. In fact, we have a 75+ year old relative in the household and (like many other retirees in Florida) she and her friends are out and about more than any of us!  #WisdomofAge</p>
<p>I figure that we've all probably had covid many times over by now, so we don't let the fear stop us like it used to in the beginning when we used to believe what the news told us without ever questioning it. Thankfully with Florida being free, we've been able to use the #EvidenceofourEyes to SEE for ourselves that covid doesn't seem to be dangerous for most people. I know lots of people who've had it and most have only had mild symptoms. To this day I do not know anyone personally who has died OF covid - although I do know a 93 year old relative who had a host of other medical conditions and died WITH covid (and I'm sad for his death like I am for anyone who's died). </p>
<p><strong>Do I think covid is real?</strong> I used to say 'yes,' now I say 'maybe.' Is it all a pLandemic? I believe it's<a href="https://theeagleswillfly.com/event-201/">reasonable to assume it probably is</a>. </p>
<p>Whether Covid is a real virus or not, I am not trying to be flippant about the risk. I am a parent and I love my kids. I love my family. I don't want to put them in unnecessary risk situations. And personally one of my life goals is to try to live to 100+ years old so I don't wanna die either. But I don't want my family live a #LockdownLife either to try to escape a virus that poses very little risk to us (we're 99%'ers like most of you) - it seems to me that living a lockdown life is not really 'living' at all and I pray that all of you will one day have a CHOICE about whether you want to #StayHomeStaySafe or whether you want to take your chances against a virus that has a 99%+ infection-survival rate for most people. </p>
<p>How do we protect ourselves? First off, wee try to stay healthy - eating good foods, using the <a href="https://theeagleswillfly.com/will-improving-your-immunity-help-protect-you-against-covid-19/">immunity defense tips regarding certain vitamins from Dr Mercola</a>or similar health gurus, exercising, meditating, and being a part of our community. </p>
<p>Does that mean I'm living large and always happy? Far from it. <strong>I suffer from mental health issues just like you.</strong> I have good days and bad days. I not ashamed to admit I wanna cry when I think about the <a href="https://theeagleswillfly.com/great-reset-global-takeover/">1984 dystopian future</a> our children appear to be doomed to endure. I've been known to drown my sorrows in a beer or 3 with some country music. </p>
<p>But I continue to endure. Day by day. Telling myself that even if we are doomed to lose, we must #ResistTyranny because it's the right thing to do. </p>
<p><strong>Is there any hope?</strong> I honestly believe that it's group like the NoNewNormal that allow us to come together are part of that hope. It's important for us to communicate so we can KNOW that there are #OthersOutThere who share the same beliefs as me. I live in fear that we'll all be #censored soon and that eventually "THEY" will come for us to round us up and put us in #quarantinecamps - but until that day comes, I'm standing here with you. Standing in the breach, against the storm and hoping against hope that God will hear our cries and contend for His people once again. Let's hope that happens sooner rather than later. </p>
<p>God bless, friends. </p>
<p>"No one knows when their hour will come: As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them." Eccl 9:12</p>
<p>"Contend, Lord, with those who contend with us; fight against those who fight against us. Arise and come to our aid!" Psalm 35: 1-2</p></p>

        <p>Went to a local burger joint for lunch today.  10 people in there.  Not one mask. It was glorious. In California.</p>
