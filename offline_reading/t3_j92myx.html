        <p>Brushing aside the many ways this comparison is illogical, it is enough to point out that traffic laws are just that, laws, agreed upon by everyone and carefully refined over many years by democratically controlled institutions. Anti-Covid-19 measures are most often undemocratic decisions taken by institutions without the proper mandate and against civil rights that are guaranteed by law.</p>

        <p>Reddit is the fucking worst but I stay because of the amount of different subs and ease of crossover interests.  I have loved message boards since their beginnings and I have tried Tapatalk for more of a “feed” from my different boards but the setup is so clumsy and all boards aren’t supported.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has been skeptical of the lockdowns from the beginning. He recently said it has made him <em>question his faith in humanity</em>. This coming from one of the smartest individuals in society....I believe that we are on the right side of history. It is amazing that so many intelligent people went along with the corona madness. I learned something during all this:</p>
<p><em>Intelligence does not equal skepticism</em>.</p>

        <p>To be intelligent one has to both be open minded and skeptical. What I mean by that is that even absurd sounding ideas are considered but thought about critically. I even looked into the flat earth theory even though it’s obviously bullshit, but you have to look at it yourself, the people who make fun of flat earthers but haven’t looked into it themselves aren’t smarter, they’re just on the opposite spectrum of unintelligence.</p>

        <p>No I was talking about legit intelligent people I know personally who have become engulfed in the corona mania, because even though they are very smart, like much smarter than me, they lack skepticism--they never questioned that the entire society might have been wrong and in all actuality is in a state of mass hysteria.</p>

        <p>There's a difference between book smart and street smart. They also lack self control and are victim to fear mongering. This only means that they're not really smart and can't think for themselves. Smart people educate themselves on a given subject by leaving their emotions out of the door and are focusing on facts. I'm sorry but they're just dumb. The authority tells me that canola oil is safe hence I'll cook my fries with it when the scientific literature undeniably proves that canola oil consumption wrecks your health. People no longer know how to think for themselves, they're just looking for articles to confirm their emotional bias.</p>

        <p>reddit  actively hunts down subreddits, that go against the mainstream narrative and also  block growth of them through quarantining them at the extreme.</p>
<p>i am surprised, that at almost 10k members the reddit censorship monsters didn't delete it yet with made up reasons.</p>
<p>so 10k means a lot for a massive censorship platform and in NO WAY! represents the true representative number of people, who had enough.</p>

        <p>Perhaps, I think there are too many people that are content, that just go with all the restrictions without thinking about it. Their life just hasn't been disrupted enough or they don't care enough to express it. Things just have to get ridiculus enough and I think people will start being more resistant.</p>
<p>The Holidays, especially Thanksgiving and Christmas may be the breaking point in the US. I know a lot of people that are planning and excited the whole year up to it to plan the work parties, to get together with extended family, etc.</p>

        <p>Totally. Whenever I hear ‘ oh. We are all in this together ‘ I say fuck, no! Simply not true. There are so many people whose experiences differ greatly during this pandemic. There are those who are on full pay, sitting at home. Maybe they don’t want to go back to work. No commuting, less expenses, eating at home instead of takeout sandwiches etc, seeing more of their loved ones, it all adds up. Then there are the people who are working in their office, again, on full pay, less traffic, less people, that’s appealing to some too.  Then there are the people that weren’t working when the pandemic hit. The people that have retired already and are on pensions etc. The only disruption to their lives really is wearing masks, and possibly not seeing their families, if they stick to that . So there is no rush to get back to ‘normal’. Then there are the others. They’ve lost their jobs, they’re getting unemployment for now, but they might be earning less than when they were working. Not necessarily. Some are getting more not  working. The companies they work for will remain solvent, and they will have a job to go back to. And then there are the others who have lost their jobs, and their companies have folded, so they won’t have a job to actually go back to. You are so right. The level of disruption is commensurate with your personal and financial situation, together with a need to get back to work and a normal existence. I am a Brit living in California. I was talking to a friend in England yesterday. I asked her. What’s the feeling on the streets there?? She said people are getting really fed up. So I said yes, but what are they doing about it though?  She said not much. But I have noticed the media are reporting more on the devastation of continued lockdowns, so that’s something. My point is I guess, yes there’s more dissent. But not much is actually happening. The Holidays might be a turning point. I can’t believe I am even saying that.  April. Two weeks.  Flatten the curve.</p>

        <p>Ours ran out months ago in the US... around the beginning of August I think for the extra unemployment benefits and we only got one $1,200 stimulus check back in April which isn’t enough money to do anything really.  </p>
<p>This virus seems more and more like a deliberate attack on the middle class.  Our wealth is being stripped completely as they get ready to push socialism on us and the masses will happily clamor for their socialist checks to save them.... of course they will seem like saviors at first but then when they start deciding who has the social credit to deserve checks like
China does this shit will get real.  If you disagree with the party you’ll get cut off.  So people will lose their most fundamental rights.  And then  China will have fully won.</p>

        <p>This has all been about the Chinafication of western societies.  Our rulers are seeking to adopt the same corporate-friendly systems of social control that China has perfected.  This is absolutely going to lead to a social credit system.  </p>

        <p>Ah, it's like looking in the mirror, we have the same views. </p>
<p>Absolutely, if the Great Reset has anything to do with it, it's about consuming less.</p>
<p>The problem with socialism is it doesn't promote the less fortunate towards the middle class, it demotes the middle classes to the lower classes of society. (I hate using classes to describe peoeple but unfortunately it exists.)</p>
<p>The western world are bending over backwards for China presently. They are the manufacturer of the world. The manufsacturer of consumerism. There's a book called "When China rules the World" - And it was written a while ago. I'd suggest giving it a read.</p>
<p>China are absolutely influencing western politics at the moment. I guess, we have to submit to their ideals in order for them to approve of the Great Reset. Conspirtual, I know but makes sense.</p>
