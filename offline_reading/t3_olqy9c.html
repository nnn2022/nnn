    <strong>I understand the skepticism but I think this kind of rallying against the "new normal" is something we should be more careful about.</strong>
    <p><p>So like I said I get the skepticism over the pandemic and I would say I even encourage. You should be skeptical just in general, but you should also make sure that that skepticism leads to a reasonable conclusion.</p>
<p>Let's take wearing masks as an example. If we are to be skeptical about wearing masks, the question that comes up is "why/why shouldn't I wear a mask?".</p>
<p>Why you should is because reportedly, there is a deadly pandemic going around and wearing a mask helps stop the spread of it, in theory it will literally save lives.</p>
<p>Why you shouldn't is because the "why" might just be a exaggeration or straight up false. If it is then you just inconvenience yourself for no reason.</p>
<p>With these two possibilities in mind we reach the conclusion that you should wear a mask, why you ask? Because that's the option with the least risk involved. If you wear an mask and the "why" turns out to be true then you've potentially saved lives and partially helped stopped the spread of the pandemic.</p>
<p>If the "why" turns out to be wrong then you end up mildly inconveniencing yourself every day.</p>
<p>So for picking the "why" option you are potentially saving lives with the slight risk of inconveniencing yourself. The "why not" option has the opposite risk and reward.</p>
<p>If you pick "why not" then you are making your day a bit easier but you run the risk of getting yourself or someone else infected. Like I said it's good to be skeptical but you have got to try and actually reach a reasonable conclusion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With that said I would like to talk about how the rallying against the "new normal" this sub seems to do a bit too often can have dire consequences.</p>
<p>The skepticism against the new normal this sub promotes is just that, skepticism. It's taking the available knowledge we have of the pandemic and questioning it which is good. The problem occurs when you begin to treat skepticism as a conclusion that differs from the general consensus.</p>
<p>This sub quite frankly does not strike me as a "skeptical" sub from the posts I've seen. It doesn't feel like a sub where different thoughts and ideas are shared regarding the new normal but rather as a circle jerk.</p>
<p>Going against what the sub is supposedly mean't to be it feels like there is a consensus, one which states something along the lines of "quarantine bad". Which sure, you can have your opinion and other may agree with it but when you spread those opinions as if they were fact it becomes easy for people without an opinion on the subject to just assume that you're correct because you sound reasonable.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by rallying agains the new normal potentially having dire consequences. People should be exposed skepticism regarding this situation not conclusions that can lead to people dying if they end up being wrong.</p></p>

        <p>Speaking for myself, it was the illogical aspects of the directives which drove me here. From what I've seen in other members, that holds true pretty much sub-wide.</p>

        <p>That's how this all started for me as well.  None of these measures made sense to me and I knew there would be massive repercussions for them.  I never thought that "masks do nothing" but the problem is that the "something" is an unknown factor and it's quite possible that their effect is not significant enough to warrant all of the negative social and even health consequences.</p>
<p>Also, part of it is that I am strongly in opposition towards giving the government new powers, especially without voting on it.  I am in strong opposition to a government forcing anything in or on my body (injections/drugs and type of garment I must wear) as well as allowing the government to decide what is essential.  We have gotten used to governments abusing "emergency" power since 911 that nobody questions it anymore even because it's been like that ever since.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your attempt at a nuanced post.</p>
<p>And unfortunately for your argument; for anyone who has been paying attention, this sub/situation is not about scepticism, well maybe it was in the beginning....</p>
<p>But now, 18 months into this. For myself and many, many others - there is simply no doubt left as to what is going on and for what purpose.</p>
<p>There are countless posts here with studies backing up logical positions on subjects such as facemasks.</p>
<p>The way you are considering and presenting that topic (and I imagine a similar trend would be observable in a discussion with you around other associated topics) is within incredibly narrow, prescribed parameters.</p>
<p>All the data required to really understand why people are <em>convinced</em> the "new normal" is something that must be resisted at any cost - is easily findable here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for anyone who trusts the government, or the media, or big pharma.... And has so far failed to see the woods for the trees - it is very hard to have a meaningful conversation. (And ofc vice versa)</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, at this stage of the game - people's positions are entrenched. (Either way).</p>
<p>All the best.</p>

        <p>That was a well thought out argument but 
What you fail to realize is that this entire “pandemic “ is based on a faulty testing system that in all reality can’t tell if a person actually has the virus or not. The reason they focus so hard on “cases” is to spread fear and nothing else. Cases do not mean sick, cases do not mean contagious. The majority of the deaths were WITH Covid not from as they report for example anytime someone dies with a positive test it is a covid death or if they die with covid “symptoms “ it’s a covid death. They made the flu disappear with covid. Why you ask because they relabeled it as covid. There has been so much hypocrisy during this that if you stop watching the news it’s actually very easy to see.  </p>
<p>I will not submit to “the new normal”. I will not submit to further government control. I will not submit to other people’s fear.</p>

<p>Long story short, you are trying to dictate HOW people should handle a literal descent into tyranny, while thinking you are the good guy. Which maybe you have good intentions, but to me it just looks like the fear mongering got smeared so deep in your brain you have no choice but to replicate it. Also, this sub isn't just about masks. Really tired of people who aren't actually active in it thinking that narrowly about this whole matter.</p>

        <p>there is a deadly pandemic going around and wearing a mask helps stop the spread of it, in theory it will literally save lives</p>
<p>You're assuming I care about other people enough to "inconvenience" myself with a mask, especially people I will never even meet.</p>

        <p>Hello and this is a message to this sub's users:  u/MrMcHat is from obviously a visitor to this sub but it appearsw as if he is being respectful and has a genuine question.  If you don't want to answer his questions, please don't bother responding.</p>
<p>It's very verbose though and the answer to this is not a one-liner in my opinion so I'm just not in the mood to formulate a response that will almost certainly go into the mental waste bin.  If these guys start showing up to respond to each other I'm going to shut it down.</p>

        <p>What I have on or inside my body is none of anyone's business.  Of course a company uniform is different in terms of clothing although but I find it unethical to coerce grown adults to take an injection of anything.  We have to put limits on government's authority to interfere in our day to day lives because otherwise the natural trend to to end up in the direction of North Korea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;With that said I would like to talk about how the rallying against the "new normal" this sub seems to do a bit too often can have dire consequences.</p>
<p>I understand that this is what you believe which is consistent with the propaganda and the majority of society but the mainstream narrative has been wrong so many times in the last year or so and not only that, they have knowingly been deceptive and covered things up such as the origin of Covid itself.</p>
<p>How can you still trust the people who told you two weeks to slow the spread that now is on it's way to two years?  To me, that makes it quite clear that these people either don't know what they are doing or we were intentionally lied to from the beginning.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the two weeks thing didn't make sense from the beginning because if it was contagious as advertised, two weeks weren't going to ever stop anything which is probably why they said "to slow the spread" instead the misguided belief that eradication was possible.</p>

        <p>I got banned from r/Justiceserved then r/aww  just for membership here.</p>
<p>There is a subtle message in that.  </p>
<p>Censorship and propaganda not just here, but all social media, all main-stream media.</p>
<p>"Trust the science" has become a tagline not a mandate.</p>
<p>A mask mandate has become a draconian power grab.</p>
<p>I wear it like a like a good little citizen but I'm not gonna be silent about it when I get the opportunity to speak (while I still can)</p>
<p>I wear it confident in its ineffectiveness out of spite, always watching and noting who is clearly buying the narrative and who is, like me, making eye contact with others who watch the masses with incredulity.  I've found that they tend to avoid spraying poison on their hands and they don't wear the muzzle alone in the car.  </p>
<p>I want to hear diverse opinions from professionals and academics.</p>
<p>I want transparency about the origins and funding of the research.</p>
<p>I want sovereign countries to move independently and not in LOCK-STEP.</p>
<p>I just need to understand the reason why these cancelled doctors, nurses, paramedics, insiders, researchers etc. decide to commit career suicide by speaking out, what is the benefit to them?</p>
<p>I'd rather be wrong and condemned to live in shame . . .</p>
