    <strong>I found a cheap flight to Rome...then I worked out the logistical exercise involved in flying there as an unvaccinated person</strong>
    <p><p>BTW it's only slightly more convenient if you are vaccinated.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because of the Covid situation, the only vaguely affordable flight is from Manchester at 7am. I used to live near Manchester, but now I don't, so I would have to get a taxi at some ridiculous time of the morning, incurring additional expense and rendering the trip not as affordable as it would have been. I could stay in a hotel in Manchester, but that is no cheaper and no doubt involves more hoop jumping. I can't even get an Airbnb because the flight leaves too early to hand the keys back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need a negative Covid test before I can go to Italy. However, booking a test is not easy. If I don't book a test through official channels, which is made as difficult as possible, then I could pay extra for a home test, thus rendering the affordable trip less affordable. Even then, you have to be careful that you acquire the right type of test, as if you get the wrong type of test, you will be refused entry to Italy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have to take a test at a maximum of three days before you leave. Arranging this through official channels is bordering on impossible. So you'd pretty much be obliged to have a home test, incurring more expense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've got to arrange for someone to look after my dog. This one is on me. However, theoretically they would need to look after my dog in my house, as technically I have to come straight home and quarantine immediately when I return. There is no wriggle room here; if I collect my dog from any address other than my own, I have broken the law. If I cannot arrange for someone to look after my dog in my own home, I would then have to arrange for someone to look after my dog for an additional 10 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The test requirement means that you cannot book until two days before you leave, because if you test positive then you're never getting into Italy in a million years. If you wish to travel with someone, the same applies to them. Of course, we know that the tests are unreliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't looked into travel insurance, but no doubt they will ask me if I'm vaccinated and then either (a) fuck me over when they find out that I'm not, (b) refuse to insure me, rendering the trip either extremely risky, or, more likely, impossible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would need to wear a mask during the flight, even though I have tested negative, even though everyone on board has tested negative, and even though most people will be vaccinated, as most people cannot quarantine on return and so are basically forced to be vaccinated in order to travel (I am a writer, I'm very fortunate, I have worked from home for 10 years, I can quarantine. My life is one massive quarantine!). I haven't worn a mask previously, and could theoretically try to claim that I'm mask-exempt, but I'm not sure I would wish to take the risk, as I've seen people ejected from flights for the most trivial reasons, and I've also read the terms and conditions associated with air travel, which effectively state that the airline can do anything. So I'd probably have to wear a mask to be on the safe side, as if you're ejected than you're obviously fucked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cannot rule out the possibility that even if I jump through every hoop that I would be refused entry to Italy for some reason on arrival. Thankfully, I don't actually need a visa, but in this climate you never know what can happen. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the time of writing, I would need to self-isolate in Italy when I arrived. This won't be the case after 30th July, so at that point visiting Rome would at least become feasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, while it is unlikely, I also cannot rule out the possibility that while I'm in Italy, the rules regarding Covid will change, and I will either (a) be forced to quarantine or self-isolate, (b) end up stranded in Italy. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/advice/holidays-italy-latest-covid-restrictions-entry-requirements/">the Daily Telegraph</a>: “Everyone in Italy is obliged to carry a mask with them when they leave home. Masks are mandatory in all indoor public places, including shops and on public transport. They must also be worn outdoors where keeping one metre apart is impossible. They should be worn in cars and taxis, when passengers are from different households and inside restaurants, cafés and bars, except when seated at a table and/or eating or drinking. Attitudes vary, and there are noisy pockets of resistance to the mask rules, but it's quite common for people to don face covers even when not required."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Daily Telegraph continues: "Customers must wear masks at all times when shopping, and are expected to use the sanitizer gel provided as they enter. Some shops also take customers' temperature. How many people can enter a shop depends on floor space: the limit will be displayed on the front door. Masks must be worn at all times when on board and in train stations.” I'm 100% comfortable in not wearing a mask in the UK, but I must confess that my ability to communicate with the authorities and annoyed Italian people in Italian is limited, albeit my friend speaks Italian quite fluently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I return to the UK, I must take a test and secure a certificate with a negative result within 48 hours of departure. If I fail to do so, I will be denied boarding, and risk a fine of £500 on arrival back in the UK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once I am on home soil, I then have to quarantine. I cannot leave my home for 10 days. I can't even take my dog for a walk. I live in the countryside and am surrounded by fields, but if I take my dog for a short walk to chase a ball in a field that is no more than 50 yards from my house, I am breaking the law. This is despite the fact that I will come into contact with absolutely no-one, will be in the open air where it's basically impossible to contract a virus, and will be literally within sight of my own home. While I could probably get away with this, if I am unfortunate enough that the police happen to do a spot check when I'm 50 yards from my house with my dog, in full view of my own home, completely on my own, with a negative Covid test, I can, and probably will, be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, meaning potentially a <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/uk-new-arrivals-to-face-jail-fines-for-breaking-covid-rules/2138940">fine of up to £10,000, and a jail sentence of up to 10 years</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am fortunate enough to have a garden and views of the Peak District, but if, for example, you lived in a flat in London, you would then be confined to potentially one room for 10 days, with no legal right to go anywhere or do anything.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've probably forgotten stuff, but, anyway, I decided not to go.</p></p>

        <p>The elite don't like the middle class, and sure don't like the middle class flying around.  Eventually, you won't be able to go to Italy ever because of a (covid/climate-change/other) social credit score.</p>

        <p>I'm happy where I am. It would just have been nice to see a few things. I'm not one of these people that is obsessed with travelling, I prefer to enjoy my everyday life, but I wanted to go to Rome, the Rhine region of Germany, Tokyo and the Swiss Alps. No doubt there are some other places that I would go, but it would have been nice to see those locations.</p>

        <p>I feel you OP. I’m American and happy where I am but I’ve always wanted to see the world, just never got around to it. Now I’ll never be able to because I’ll never get vaccinated and the testing requirements seem like way too much of a hassle (and who knows how long they’ll even allow a negative test as an alternative to the vax.)</p>
<p>It sucks but I’ve made peace with it.</p>

        <p>Nobody would possible know that you’ve more than 50 yards away from house unless you tell them or you take your phone everywhere with you. Nobody would stop me going my back yard, if I had one. I live in flat so would never have one. The covid rules are designed to make a shit ton of money and make flying a think for the rich.</p>

        <p>You can go in your backyard or garden, so I could confine my dog to my garden. I just don't think this is fair. You are correct that I could probably get away with it, and of course I have considered this. However, if I am unfortunate enough that the police happen to spot check, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/travel/holidays-foreign-airports-wales-coronavirus-20636542">which is happening</a>, while I'm with my dog then I wouldn't have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not actually sure that I can arrange for either (a) someone to look after my dog at my house, or (b) someone to look after my dog for an entire holiday and then 10 days after I get back. Yes, I know that I can theoretically break the law, but I'm just saying that this is what I would be required to do.</p>

        <p>The laws stupid and open to interpretation in many different ways. If you’ve got a big back yards then it would be more than 50 yards. So it makes no actually sense. Borris is fine to break his own rules tho, hence why I doubt it’s a deadly disease.</p>

        <p>It definitely makes no sense, at least from our perspective. It makes sense from an authoritarian perspective.</p>
<p>But, actually, it's quite clear. You have to stay in your house and garden. As soon as you set foot outside of your house, you have broken the law. I guess it would be okay to put the bins out, beyond that you cannot legally leave your house and garden.</p>

        <p>Just had an argument with my mum about borris not following his own rules and then she says she doesn’t want to go to a dentist that hadn’t had the vax. She’s had it, I’ve not as I don’t plan on going on holiday, anytime soon. So I don’t see the difference there at all. She will be around me that will never have it but not a dentist.
