    <strong>British Medical Journal article summarizes what we know and what not - ironically it rhymes with what skeptics have been saying</strong>
    <p><p>The editorial article is by Allyson M Pollock, professor of public health, James Lancaster, independent researcher. This is not by some "right-wing nutcase", but in a reputable journal by professors.</p>

<p>Interesting bits -- well, all of it, but just an excerpt:</p>
<p>"Unusually in disease management, a positive test result is the sole criterion for a covid-19 case. Normally, a test is a support for clinical diagnosis, not a substitute. This lack of clinical oversight means we know very little about the proportions of people with positive results who are truly asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection and the proportions who are paucisymptomatic (subclinical), presymptomatic (go on to develop symptoms later), or post-infection (with viral RNA fragments still detectable from an earlier infection)."</p>
<p>"It’s also unclear to what extent people with no symptoms transmit SARS-CoV-2. The only test for live virus is viral culture. PCR and lateral flow tests do not distinguish live virus. No test of infection or infectiousness is currently available for routine use.678 As things stand, a person who tests positive with any kind of test may or may not have an active infection with live virus, and may or may not be infectious.9"</p></p>

        <p>"The BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal, published by the trade union the British Medical Association (BMA). The BMJ has editorial freedom from the BMA.[1] It is one of the world's oldest general medical journals. Originally called the British Medical Journal, the title was officially shortened to BMJ in 1988, and then changed to The BMJ in 2014.[2]" (wikipedia)</p>
