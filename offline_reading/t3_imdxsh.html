        <p>To what extent are you for wearing masks? I am not opposed to a temporary targeted mask rule (ie to flatten the curve and within public indoor spaces such as grocery stores)</p>
<p>However, the scope creep has been huge. My city (Toronto) passed one saying it was temporary and targeted. Within two months it’s changed to likely 2 or 3 years of masks and apartment dwellers have to wear one as soon as they leave their home. I’m worried it will very likely cover outside too because these mask stans just want to see everyone wearing them.</p>
<p>Now they’re forcing kindergartners to wear them. This is fucking psycho and no longer about the virus but about wearing a uniform. Our numbers aren’t even bad here.</p>

<p>And that phenomenon is a big part of why I’d strenuously oppose even a “temporary targeted mask rule” (or a “two-week lockdown to flatten the curve”). The slippery slope is real. You want to <em>recommend</em> that people wear masks or “social distance” for two weeks in an effort to buy some time for hospitals to ramp up capacity? Go for it. I think you’ll find that most people will be happy to oblige. But use state coercion to force those behaviors? Fuck that.</p>
<p>&rt;Now they’re forcing kindergartners to wear them. This is fucking psycho and no longer about the virus but about wearing a uniform.</p>
<p>It is <em>completely</em> fucking psycho although I wouldn’t say it’s “no longer” about the virus as it seems pretty clear now that it never was.</p>

<p>I've been trying to tell people this since March, on lockdowns, on masks, on all the security theater, and so on. But people continue to go "Durr hurr it's only for two weeks/a month/a few months/a year, why are you being such a baby about it?" As the goalposts shift via the politicians, so do the ones from the populace, including the skeptics on our side too. This whole thing feels like a litmus test on how much people are willing to put up with, and how many freedoms they are willing to trash. The results are unsurprising to me, but also depressing as fuck.</p>

        <p>I agree with your point, but I guess I’m outlining my baseline positioning without considering strategic politics. Kinda trying to show why we can’t give an inch even if it might seem reasonable</p>

        <p>"I'm for wearing masks" - great, then wear one. THEY ONLY PROTECT THE WEARER - PERIOD.</p>
<p>just look at any occupational safety information on masks </p>
<p>just like a hard hat or safety goggles, no mask is designed to control the exhale.</p>
<p>an i'm talking real N95 masks , not these random cotton face coverings that seem to be just fine. </p>
<p>it's nonsense , but YOU can do whatever YOU feel necessary , it has F-all to do with me.</p>

        <p>Let's also look at unintended consequences. Here are just a few examples. </p>
<p>Dentists and other doctors are finding evidence of increased disease in their patients wearing masks. The payoff is in the treatment of these increased diseases. Just look up stinky syndrome and mask-ne (increased acne from masks) for an introduction. One could read studies or just use common sense and think about the increased BACTERIA behind the stinky syndrome and acne.</p>
<p>Businesses are getting their liability insurance rewritten to include being protected from being sued for accusations of contagion from their premises. The pay off is for lawyers and insurance companies. See this article for the minutia: http://www.sheehan.com/news/will-your-commercial-general-liability-insurance-policy-cover-covid-19-claims/</p>
<p>Single use product waste has significantly increased since the security theater, including disposable masks. https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-single-use-plastic-waste-by-jacob-duer-2020-06
The payoff is for the manufacturing and disposal industries.</p>
<p>Schools are suddenly much less challenged by discipline problems because they have more and stronger reaons to kick kids out, and they have less incentive to create lessons that preclude behavior problems. School administrative payoffs. https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/08/19/utah-students-staff-who/</p>
<p>Mandates drive all these consequences to a far greater extent than voluntary use would. </p>
<p>And they create scape goats for some very expensive longterm problems society has had for a long time. Extremely poor ventilation and air quality in older buildings, deadly air quality throughout poor communities near dirty industry across the country, hazardous ozone and microparticulate levels in urban areas. Oh you don't like the air? Where is your mask? </p>
<p>Voila, in one broad sweep, government has placed regulation responsibility back on the environmental victims and has rewarded lawyers, insurance companies, and big pharma/public health with an all you can eat buffet of new accusations and claims and remediation, and the bureaucracies can keep going brrrr.</p>
