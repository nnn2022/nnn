        <p>My family has always been very open about death. It’s never been a taboo subject. It wasn’t ever hidden or sugar coated. From my parents to grandparents, they were all about living life to the fullest because no day was promised. Death doesn’t scare me. I always hope I die swiftly and painlessly but again, nothing is promised.</p>
<p>Seeing so many seemingly have the first realization in their lives that they will in fact die some day has been wild and infuriating. People really think they’re immortal. And they’re ruining my short time on this earth with this fucking God complex bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yep I’ve accepted the risk I may get it if I haven’t already and whatever consequences come with that. I’ll take some precautions but otherwise going to go live my life. I’d rather risk death even than live for years or more in a “new normal” dystopian world. </p>
<p>The insane part is you can be ostracized for choosing not to live in fear.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think Lauren is wrong and most people just put on a mask because their over controlling governor told them to. People like her who pat themselves on the back for being “caring” and “respectful” are the worst.</p>

        <p>I am afraid of the process of dying, having seen it up close several times.  However, I'm not afraid of being dead.</p>
<p>And more to the point:  I'd rather be dead than alive in a totalitarian society where people inform on their neighbors, eschew all human contact, and abdicate their rational faculties to a government and media that have proven their unreliability over and over.</p>

        <p>I'm going to have to disagree with you. The way you wrote this is way too inflammatory. Yes the virus shouldn't be feared how it is, but the argument that everyone will die anyways so we shouldn't try to mitigate it is not a strong one. The strongest part of your argument is that everything else has a higher chance of killing you, but the people you're talking to don't have that viewpoint, they think that the virus is super deadly and have bought into the hype. I feel like this is will just drive people away from scepticism of what's going on. </p>
<p>I would however like to take a moment and thank you and this community for existing and helping me feel less ostracized, and feel supported because there are other free thinking people that are critical of what's going on.</p>
