    <strong>Simple math that proves the United States government is defaulting</strong>
    <p><p>According to https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/mspd/2021/opds042021.pdf the public debt is at $27,747,798,000,000 as of December 2020.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the interest owed on this debt amounts to $522,767,299,265.34 in 2020, according to https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm</p>
<p>This means OFFICIALLY, the United States government is insolvent and will default on the international stage once the treasury yields pass 1.88399562108%.</p>
<p>$522,767,299,265.34 / $27,747,798,000,000 = 1.88399562108%</p>
<p>This is the REAL reason they shut down the economy, not because of covid. It's just simple math. If they allowed this to continue any further, the system would have collapsed. The party is over and thus the need for a global financial system reset.</p>
<p>This is also why the US government has been spending like a drunken sailor. They know they are going to default/hyperinflate, so they better get something out of the currency before itâ€™s too late.</p></p>

        <p>OK, I agree that the USD is absolutely toast and that C19 is a cover for the repo market implosion that happened in Sept 2019, but as an economist, I need to correct a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The US Treasury issues fixed-coupon bonds (except for TIPS and FRNs, of course).</li>
<li>An increase in yield means that it'll be more difficult to roll over the debt in the future as the value of the securities declines, requiring MORE debt to be issued to compensate for the reduced value of securities.</li>
<li>The US Treasury issues bills, notes and bonds with maturities ranging from 4 weeks to 30 years. (There was even talk of 50Y bonds in 2019!) Differing maturities naturally mean differing yields to maturities, so one cannot derive a universal yield at which the US defaults.</li>
</ol>

        <p>And that 30Y yeild is absolute trash (2.261% as of right now).</p>
<p>That said, since you're an economist: Do you think stagflation, or inflation/hyperinflation is more likely?</p>

        <p>Hey! I had been offline for over a month.</p>
<p>LOL. Inflation is not "transitory" as we have a dysfunctional labour system AND collapsing supply chains AGAINST a backdrop of hyperactive fiscal stimulation funded by the Fed. (I am not from the US but just assumed that you are.) Stagflation will ultimately cause hyperinflation after the "Cyber Pandemic" shuts down the economy for 6-8 weeks. The USD will lose 'reserve status' and the IMF will increase its SDR quotas for all countries and become the new reserve currency. National currencies will exist as central bank digital currencies.  </p>
<p>I recently made fun of the inflation narrative. Here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o9ffnt/the_clowns_in_charge_of_the_wests_central_banks/</p>

        <p>This is why we are in a hyperinflationary depression and why there's rent/mortgage moratoriums that will never end. The country would be faced with staggering numbers of homeless and unemployed through no fault of their own. You can ultimately thank the Federal Reserve for this.</p>

        <p>Oh yes. Everyone needs to prepare heavily for a complete loss of purchasing power. This is why Klaus Schwab at the World Economic Forum says "You will own nothing and be happy." They aren't going door to door to take your stuff. They're doing it through mathematics.</p>

        <p>I agree to a point. However, I think they could string it along further with inflation. As long as the money supply grows, they can cover the minimum payments to service the debt. The 4 trillion dollars borrowed into existence in the last year will keep the lights on for a bit longer, albeit at the cost of noticeably higher prices everywhere.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong. Not an economist, just someone who knows our money is debt.</p>
