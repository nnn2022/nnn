        <p>It just doesn't add up. I know nobody who has died, and I know a great many people. 
Also, I hate to be callous, but the average age of mortality for the illness is eighty something. I'm 35 trying to provide for a family; why should I have to give up my livelihood for strangers who have &rt;10 years left to live? My kids have their whole lives ahead of them, and the quality thereof is being decimated.</p>

        <p>I do know people who have died from this virus: My own mother and father, who were barely 69 when they died from a negligent rehab center sending Dad home with this virus to Mom and I, killing Dad and Mom and getting me sick.</p>
<p>The thing that pisses me off? They are refusing to hand over Father's medical records to the medical malpractice lawyer I hired.</p>
<p>That alone makes me think that something very horrible happened with my father.</p>
<p>Especially since I listened in on speakerphone calls my Mom had with the Social Services lady, telling her that someone since Dad left Johns Hopkins Hospital for the rehab facility after his CAB had kept on trying to get him a CoVid-19 test!</p>
<p>I'm betting Dad was sitting in the rehab facility for nearly 2 months, slowly dying from CoVid-19.</p>
<p>My Daddy was the epitome of "Tough old bird!" so I can believe he was fighting it off until it started attacking his CAB.</p>

        <p>I'm a fucking liberal. Yesterday I got a 100 piece order. When I pulled up to the house, I was actually happy to see the Trump flag. That meant I didn't have to wear a mask while hauling groceries inside the house.</p>

        <p>The testing is a fraud, the death certificates are a fraud, almost everything about this "pandemic" is fraudulent and easily debunked. Any doctor still clinging to the narrative needs to lose their licence or worse since they're in violation of the hippocratic oath of "first do no harm".</p>

        <p>No, the death certificates are not a fraud. We do have a disease called CoVid-19 going around. It does exist.</p>
<p>We do not have people being labeled as CoVid-19 deaths when they are not CoVid-19 deaths.</p>
<p>If you get CoVid-19, even if you have other pre-ex's, and were STABLE before getting CoVid-19? You were killed by CoVid-19 so they rightly count you as a CoVid-19 death.</p>
<p>Same thing for someone being in an accident with CoVid-19: If your accident was caused by you passing out due to CoVid-19 (something I nearly did at the wheel while going to Baltimore to get my CV-19 test), you are rightly labeled a CoVid-19 death because if you didn't have the CV-19, you wouldn't have passed out at the wheel.</p>

        <p>By your logic, if someone sneezes and gets into accident because of it, it should be written off as death from cold. Right?</p>
<p>Or, another example, if someone gets into accident because of drunk driving, it should be counted as death from alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p>You must be joking.</p>

        <p>"... I think we are not going to be wearing masks any less anytime soon if people are going to continue to behave the way they're currently behaving," Kraft said. "I would say we have at least another year at the rate we're going ... But that has to do with the effort that we're sort of seeing in the public. The more people that are just refusing to wear masks and making this an issue of personal freedom, I think the longer we're going to be wearing masks. The longer we can't get it done, the longer that the pandemic rages on."</p>
<p>"We may need to (wear masks and update the vaccine) hopefully not every year but potentially on a regular basis in order to keep ahead of changes the virus is making," he said.</p>
<p>"All three experts said it might be possible that masking becomes a more general cultural norm, especially during cold and flu season."</p>
<p>"That would be something, as an infectious disease physician, that I would be very excited about," said Kraft. "We are learning, for better or for worse, about things such as how to protect ourselves, how to not come to work if we're sick, how to wear protective equipment when others are sick or when we're sick ourselves. The masks are really about source control and about protecting ourselves, so I definitely think we will see more masking wearing when people don't feel well ... And that would be a good thing."</p>
<p>Jesus. So just because we have case counts are in the 100K+ each day, the vaccine doesn't matter? AND I AM NOT FOR WEARING MASKS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. These people can, but expect mask compliance to be nothing by spring/summer.</p>

At first we didn't but now that we know and the whole thing has been a fearmongering campaign, let's get on with our lives...
