    <strong>Understanding How Sketchy Vaccines, Rough Terrain, High Fevers, Human DNA, Autoimmune Diseases, And Spike Protein, All Form Interconnected Parts Of A Very Complex System ... PSA: This Is Your Brain, ON VACCINES! Brought To You By The Partnership For A Vaccine Free America</strong>
    <p><p>In the 1980's there was an anti-drug abuse PSA on TV from The <em>Partnership For A Drug Free America</em>, that went, </p>
<p>"This is your brain... This is your brain... ON DRUGS!"</p>
<p>And to illustrate this point, they used a chicken egg to represent your brain, </p>
<p>And a sizzling hot frying pan represented the drugs. </p>
<p>And they cracked the egg, and put it in the frying pan, and the egg fried, </p>
<p>And the fried-egg metaphor was well-understood by the public, and so the public quit abusing drugs, and so therefore the PSA was considered a success story.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOnENVylxPI</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Your_Brain_on_Drugs</p>
<p>Just kidding. All things considered, it was a miserable failure, with much more drug consumption today than there was in the 1980s</p>
<p>The PSA ads seem to just go on forever. like for years, and anyone who watched TV in the 1980s will remember these PSA ads... and laugh about them...</p>
<p>BUT the PSA ads did accidentally tell the truth... <em>ABOUT VACCINES</em></p>
<p>And how your brain is the chicken egg, </p>
<p>And the sizzling hot frying pan, is the fever, that is caused by a vaccine.</p>
<p>I wen't into some depth on this "friend egg" metaphor for protein folding on an earlier post. </p>
<p>Heres a link in case you missed it. (a must read!)</p>

<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProblemSolvingMatrix/comments/ngapg6/complex_systems_how_do_pool_balls_break_spectrum/"><strong>To use the game of pool as a metaphor for complex systems</strong></a>, </p>
<p>Most people who have played pool, can intuitively understand the basic cause-and-effect of hitting the cue ball into a numbered ball, and making that numbered ball fall in the pocket.  </p>
<p>And most people who have played pool, can intuitively understand the basic cause-and-effect of a 2, or 3, or even a 4 ball combination. </p>
<p>But most people who have played pool, can NOT consistently make an 8-ball break, </p>
<p>And most people who have played pool, can NOT intuitively understand why the balls break the exact way they do on the opening break, or why most opening breaks are unique, compared to all other possible opening breaks.  </p>
<p>So we have a spectrum, a scale, from 1-15 of how well the average lay-person can understand cause-and-effect, in terms of the complexity of predicting the outcomes of systems of multiple variables. </p>
<hr>
<p>I have been actively engaged in the vaccine debate almost every day from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/my9h20/update_the_most_important_mmrautism_study_ever/">August 27, 2014</a>, until today, May 21, 2021, which is coming up on 7 years...</p>
<p>And in that time, i have read, and watched, and listened, and researched, and discussed, and debated, many different vaccine concepts, with many different pro-vaccine people. </p>
<p>And the vast majority of my sources, have been pro-vaccine sources. </p>
<p>We merely disagree on the semantics, and the subtle implications hidden in these pro-vaccine sources. </p>
<hr>
<p>So how did I become "anti-vaccine"?</p>
<p>First of all, the term "anti-vaccine" is a slur, a misnomer. </p>
<p>It would be more proper to call the critics "EX-vaccine",  or "pro-SAFE-vaccine" </p>
<p>Since most of these vaccine critics and skeptics were previously PRO-vaccine, </p>
<p><a href="/r/HearThisWell+VaccineReaction+VaccineInjury+VaccineHomicide">Until one day they had a bad experience with a vaccine, and then they became skeptical, and started asking too many questions</a>. </p>
<hr>
<p>I became "less-pro-vaccine" because after a while, it became very evident that "the science" was fixed,</p>
<p>Around "the narrative" that vaccines are safe and effective, and necessary. </p>
<p>And so i started to study the abnormal psychology of the people behind "the science", and the people who believe "the science",</p>
<p>And after a while, it became very evident that the current state of vaccine science, which is "just trust the science", </p>
<p>is the exact antithesis of the original spirit of the Scientific Method! </p>
<hr>
<p>To summarize some of what i have observed, as far as wishful thinking, cherry-picking, circular-logic, and selective critical thinking...</p>
<p>1) if a vaccine DOES NOT cause a fever, then that means the vaccine is <em>safe</em></p>
<p>2) if a vaccine DOES cause a fever, then that means the vaccines is <em>effective</em></p>
<p>3) if a vaccine DOES cause a fever of 104.9F, then thats actually safe, because vaccines studies prove vaccines are very safe. </p>
<hr>
<p>1) if any study suggests that vaccines are good, then its automatically a good study.</p>
<p>2) if any study suggests that vaccines are bad, then its automatically a bad study.</p>
<p>But besides just cherry-picking "muh studies", it became very evident that most people just can't think abstractly, especially about vaccines, as a complex system. </p>
<hr>
<p>Most people can understand the cause-and-effect of a vaccine administration, </p>
<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/whawuwonxpwy.jpg">AND the redness and swelling around the vaccine injection site</a>, </p>
<p>Thats a 1-ball cut shot. maybe. </p>
<hr>
<p>I have encountered many people, who can't seem to understand the cause-and-effect of a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProblemSolvingMatrix/comments/n5zvvk/new_fever_reports_this_is_your_brain_on_drugs_psm/">vaccine causing a fever</a>, AND/OR a headache,</p>
<p>AND when i press them on their reasoning, they explain that the vaccine goes in the arm, and the forehead is a long way away from the injection site.  </p>
<p>This is a 2-ball split, bank shot. maybe</p>
<hr>
<p>However most people CAN seem to understand the cause-and-effect of a MMR vaccine administration, </p>
<p><a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-340">AND a person developing vaccine-induced immunity to Measles, AND/OR Mumps AND/OR Rubella</a>.</p>
<p>Thats a 3-Ball split. Nice Shot!  </p>
<p>::Crowd Noise Intensifies::: </p>
<hr>
<p>I have encountered many people who can't understand the cause-and-effects, of a vaccine causing a high fever, AND/OR headache,</p>
<p>AND then the high fever ALSO causing <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vaccines-autism-and-brain-damage-whats-in-a-name/">brain damage</a>, AND/OR <a href="https://i.redd.it/0865pgthhfw61.png">organ damage</a> AND/OR <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8w4eun/webmd_edits_their_dravet_syndrome_page_from_the/">genetic damage</a> AND/OR <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25966693/">protein denaturing</a> </p>
<p>This is a 3-ball combination and split. maybe</p>
<hr>
<p>I have encountered many people who can't understand the cause-and-effect of spraying a live "attenuated" flu virus vaccine up a girls nose, </p>
<p>AND then the girl soon becoming "infected" with the flu, </p>
<p>AND then the girl dying, </p>
<p>AND then the doctor AND/OR nurse who gave the vaccine playing stupid, ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_x6QmuJdms">It Wasn't Me! ~ The Shaggy Defense</a> )</p>
<p>AND then the parents playing stupid,</p>
<p>AND then the live nasal flu vaccine makers playing stupid, about why they discontinued making the vaccine,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2016/11/28/family-iowa-girl-who-died-flu-urges-vaccinations/94568902/">AND then the so-called journalist, who wrote it up in the big-media-conglomerate-owned "local" newspaper, playing stupid</a></p>
<p>AND then everyone who reads the story in the local newspaper, playing stupid. </p>
<p>Thats a 7-Ball combination. maybe</p>
<p>More like a bar full of noisy drunks, and your buddy throwing 4 of his balls down a pocket, while you are in the bathroom. </p>
<hr>
<p>I have encountered many people who can't understand the cause-and-effect, of a vaccine causing redness and swelling around the injection site, </p>
<p>AND/OR a fever, </p>
<p>AND IFF the fever is greater than about 104F, </p>
<p>AND the person with the fever is HOT under blankets, because they still "feel chilled",</p>
<p>AND the 104F fever causing gene damage / genetic mutations, AND/OR protein denaturing, </p>
<p>AND how the genetic damage/mutations changes the expression of a protein,  </p>
<p>AND how one well-known change in protein expression, are in the ion channels of various cells, which are called a channelopathy,</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/ProblemSolvingMatrix/search?q=channelopathy</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelopathy</p>
<p>AND how a channelopathy results in dys-regulation of ion movement into AND/OR out of a cell, </p>
<p>AND particularly in "excitable cells" like muscle cells AND/OR heart cells AND/OR brain cells,    </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential</p>
<p>AND how a channelopathy might mimic AND/OR exacerbate the symptoms of an electrolyte imbalance,  </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water-electrolyte_imbalance</p>
<p>AND thats why so many people are drinking Gatorade AND/OR Pedialyte, for preparation for AND/OR recovery from vaccination. </p>
<p>AND other people are preparing for AND/OR recovering from vaccination, by supplementing with Vitamin D, AND/OR Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium, Sodium, etc</p>
<p>AND thats why doctors are now routinely checking for electrolyte etc imbalance, when a patient comes in with symptoms, after a vaccine, AND those symptoms include Headache, Muscle Ache, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProblemSolvingMatrix/search?q=Tinnitus&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all">Tinnitus</a>, heart rate dys-regulation, </p>
<p>Thats an 11-ball combination? maybe.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lets look at this from the point of the opening break, a 15-ball combination.</p>
<p>The cue ball is the vaccine. </p>
<p>AND The first ball that the cue ball hits, is the skin, </p>
<p>or other tissue surface, such as inside the nasal cavity,</p>
<p>Henceforth called "the terrain", which is defined as <em>the physical features of a surface</em>. </p>
<hr>
<p>On his deathbed, Louis Pasteur confessed, </p>
<p>&rt;<em>"Bernard was right; i was wrong. the pathogen is nothing; the terrain is everything."</em> </p>
<hr>
<p>"the terrain", meaning, the physical features of the surface of...</p>
<p>your skin, organs, cells, </p>
<p>your digestive tract (throat, guts, bowel, etc)</p>
<p>your respiratory system (nose, lungs) </p>
<p>your circulatory system, (heart, blood vessels, blood.)</p>
<p>the COVID 19 coronavirus spike protein. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_protein</p>
<p>ACE-2 </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2</p>
<hr>
<p>AND the next 2 balls could be looked at as 1) the antigen and intended result, AND 2) the rest of the vaccine ingredients, and unintended consequence,</p>
<p>AND the next 3 balls could be looked at as the various immune responses ... intended, and unintended.</p>
<p>AND so on down the line, </p>
<p>except instead of a 15-ball combination, its more like a 15 BrazZZZZzzillion ball combination. </p>
<p>Where every cell in your body is affected, in numerous ways. </p>
<hr>
<p>It has been said that people will not let go of the old model of understanding, until they are presented with, and understand, a new model of understanding. </p>
<p>It seems that very often the old model inside of lay-peoples heads, for how vaccines work, is NOT very complex, and therefore does NOT allow for more variables, and does NOT allow for the possibilities for adverse reactions, or unintended consequences.  </p>
<p>so my aim today is to try and present a new model for vaccines that is more complex, and yet understandable to the lay-person. </p>
<p>A model that uses simple, non-controversial examples from every day life, that most people are already familiar with. </p>

<p>Water freezes at 32F.</p>

<p>Rubber Band breaking. </p>

<p>Vaccines Cause High Fever </p>
<p>Being Hot Makes You Sweat</p>
<hr>
<p>Chaos Theory: </p>
<p>We know that a rubber band can be stretched and relaxed, repeat-edly, and repeat-ably, and predictably, within a certain range of stretch, </p>
<p>BUT that if the rubber band is ever stretched too much, it will suddenly, and without any warning, SNAP, and break, and entire rubber band will fail, and the rubber band will never return to its previous, functional state. its broken forever. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Water Freezes At 32F and boils at 212F</strong> </p>
<p>This is somewhat an extension of chaos theory, where water behaves like a fluid liquid between the temperatures of 33F and 211, </p>
<p>But then suddenly, at 32F, water freezes into ice, and it changes state, and behaves like a solid. </p>
<p>If we raise the temperature of the water back above 32F, the water will change its state back to a fluid liquid, </p>
<p>And we can repeat this experiment many times, and ultimately one day convince ourselves that water will predictably freeze, and thaw, and boil, at a certain temperature </p>
<p>(IFF you are at sea level AND IFF the sea level is not rising AND IFF ... )</p>

<p>Reporter: "Is Water Wet?"...</p>
<p>The debate rages online, </p>
<p>Many people say YES!, water is obviously wet, </p>
<p>BUT some experts say its more complicated than that. </p>
<p>We went to the Arctic Circle, and talked to some indiginous Eskimos, to find out more.</p>
<p>Tune in to Channel 7 News tonight at 10PM to hear what the Eskimos had to say about this complex, and fascinating, and highly contentious issue!  </p>
<p>And Don't Forget The Popcorn! ...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Human body operates best somewhere between the temperatures of 95C and 103F</strong></p>
<p>Biological processes within the human body operate on a much tighter window, than the 32F-212F window that liquid water operates at. </p>
<p>The human body has historically been said to operate at about 98.6F (a so-called standard, which has inexplicably changed recently) </p>
<p>The human body will freeze into a block of ice at 32F, just like water will. </p>
<p>But long before the human body reaches 32F, there will be a spectrum of physiological changes in the human body. </p>
<p>If we start at 98.6F, and just start going down in temperature, everyone at some point will experience "feeling cold".</p>
<p>You could experience a "feeling cold" from something as simple as going outdoors on a cold winter day, </p>
<p>And that may only be because of a fraction of a degree of temperature difference, on a small patch of skin, at your extremities, </p>
<p>For example, if you got cold feet merely by walking barefoot out to the mailbox on a cold winter day. </p>
<p>Which is why we wear shoes, hats, and coats, and extra clothes. </p>
<p>If your body temperature continued to drop, at some point you would start to shiver, in an effort to keep warm. </p>
<p>When body temperatures drop below 95°F/35°C it is considered hypothermia</p>
<p>https://www.emedicinehealth.com/how_long_does_it_take_to_die_from_hypothermia/article_em.htm</p>
<p>Biological processes are slowed, and stopped, by colder temperatures, which is why we refrigerate, and freeze, meat. </p>
<p>The main idea here is that the human body can tolerate a little bit of cold, and will bounce back like a rubber band, </p>
<p>BUT that if the body temperature goes too low, even once, and even for a moment, then it will kill you, </p>
<p>And, once you are dead, there is no reversing that. You can't just warm up a dead body back to 98.6F and expect it to come back to life. </p>
<hr>
<p>Going the other way, if we start at 98.6F and start raising the body temperature, we will experience a spectrum of sensations, and have tangible biological reactions. </p>
<p>For example, we will "feel hot",  and we may start to sweat, in an effort to cool down. </p>
<p>If we got even hotter, we will eventually be forced to begin to take remedial actions, such as drinking water, taking off clothes, getting out of the sun, turning on the AC, etc</p>
<p>And during a heat stroke event, if a core body temperature is 104F it is considered a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the "obvious" treatment for high body temperature is to lower the body temperature, </p>
<p>Sometimes even with an ice bath, to rapidly cool the body temperature, and to reverse some of the damage that was done by the high body temperature. </p>
<p>I suspect this is why it feels good to put ice on minor burns, not simply because the ice is lowering the local temperature near the burn, but because the cold is actually reversing some of the damage that was done, </p>
<p>Perhaps it is possible to repair some damage to some of the cells that were "marginally damaged", meaning they were on the fine edge in between the badly damaged cells, at the middle of the burn, and the healthy cells outside of the burn area, that were not damaged at all. </p>
<hr>
<p>So to summarize where we are to this point, </p>
<p>The human body temperature operates well at ONE temperature, 98.6F</p>
<p>and the human body will bend, and flex, and tolerate some degree of change, </p>
<p>within fixed a range of motion, and/or within a very tight window of temperatures, from about 95-104F </p>
<p>But outside of this narrow temperature window, the human body breaks, in a way that cannot be unbroken.  </p>
<hr>
<p>Vaccines Cause High Fever. </p>
<p>We can measure a 104.9F fever as easily, and accurately, and precisely, and repeatably, and predictably, as we can measure any other symptom.  </p>
<p>So when a parent vaccinates their child, and then their child develops a fever, and the fever measures 104.9F on the thermometer...</p>
<p>That vaccine-induced fever, has caused the body temperature to rise far above its natural breaking point, </p>
<p>and therefore has caused irreversible damage to body organs, and the brain.</p>
<p>Just as assuredly and predictably, as the observation that water freezes at 32F. </p>
<hr>
<p>PSA: You must opt in to /r/VaccineUniversity quarantine warning to access some linked materials </p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProblemSolvingMatrix+VaccineUniversity/search?q=Google+Trends&amp;restrict_sr=on">If we look at Google Trends for search for high fever temperatures</a></p>
<p>Fever of 103</p>
<p>Fever of 105 </p>
<p>Fever of 107</p>
<p>Fever of 109</p>
<p>Fever of 111</p>
<p>and then we can see that there are enough of these exact google searches, to generate enough data, to show up in google trends... </p>
<p>it appears to me that the number of searches for each fever temperature follows a smooth, predictable bell curve, </p>
<p>from 98 to 112, with 103 being the most commonly googled.</p>
<p>and with 112 F being the highest fever temperature that was regularly googled,</p>
<p>as shown by fever 113 and 114 being empty data sets.</p>
<p>I believe this is basically because high temperature kills, and higher temperature kills even faster, </p>
<p>And the fine line between life and death, is somewhere between 112 and 113F</p>
<p>Note that the most commonly googled fever temperature is 103F... AND 104F is considered a life threatening medical emergency!</p>
<p>So if the fine line between life and death is somewhere between 112F and 113F, </p>
<p>Then the fine line between a mild fever that is recoverable, and a high fever that causes irreversible brain damage, is somewhere between 103 and 104F.</p>

<p><strong>Important Background Context</strong></p>
<p>To make viruses for vaccines, a virus must be grown in a suitable cell. </p>
<p>Some viruses are grown in CHO cells, which are Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_hamster_ovary_cell</p>
<p>PCOS is Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome, which is a vaccine-induced auto-immune disorder where the human immune system attacks its own ovaries. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome</p>
<p>CHO cells are the most widely used cells in industry. </p>
<p>CHO cell residue makes its way into vaccines, and into the human body, and within the context of a vaccine-induced "enhanced" immune reaction, </p>
<p>Consequently, PCOS is the most prevalent endocrine disease in the world. </p>
<p>Some other viruses are grown in chicken eggs, </p>
<p>And chicken egg residue makes its way into vaccines, and into the human body, within the context of a vaccine-induced immune response, </p>
<p>Consequently, we now have a man-made epidemic of "chicken egg allergy"</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Even More Important Background Context</strong></p>
<p>To make some viruses for vaccines, a virus must be grown in a human cell, in a lab.</p>
<p>These human cells are stem cell lines, that were harvested from elective abortions, of otherwise healthy babies.  </p>
<p>These stem cell lines have names like WI-38 , MRC-5 and HEK-293</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WI-38</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC-5</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEK_293_cells</p>
<p>Therefore, just as CHO ovary protein residue in vaccines, can cause the "auto-immune" disorder called PCOS, </p>
<p>And just as the chicken egg protein residue in vaccines, can cause a so-called "chicken egg allergy"</p>
<p>The human DNA and/or protein residue in vaccines, can, and does, cause a so-called auto-immune disorder for every organ, every cell, in the human body. </p>
<p>Make a list of the organs in the human body. </p>
<p>Find the associated auto-immune disorder for each organ, </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autoimmune_diseases</p>
<p>And then check to see if that auto-immune disorder is alleged to be caused by vaccines. </p>
<p>And Im calling the 8-Ball in the corner pocket on this one. </p>
<p>Next Up! Whose a Quarter is on the table?...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The 15-Gorillian Ball Combination</strong></p>
<p>Opening Break. Vaccine is the cue ball. First ball that gets hit is the skin. dang. its a deep puncture wound too.  </p>
<p>Next 2 balls are 1) the intended effects of vaccines, and 2) the unintended consequences, of high fevers, AND/OR autoimmune diseases. </p>
<p>The 1) "intended" effect, is to have the antigen in the vaccine, interface with the human immune system,</p>
<p>AND cause specific AND/OR non-specific immune reactions, such as the development of a fever AND/OR development of antibodies </p>
<p>BUT the 2) "unintended consequence" is the introduction of human DNA, within the physiological context of a human body's immune system, and during the "enhanced"  immune response that is caused by the vaccine. </p>
<p>While I can't yet predict where every 1 of the 15G balls will go, </p>
<p>I can say that from what i have observed, generally speaking, </p>
<p>The harder you hit the cue ball on the opening break, the wider the pool balls will spread out on the table.</p>
<p>And the higher the fever is above 103F, the more chance there is for irreversible brain damage, or other organ damage, or DNA damage, or protein damage,</p>
<p>And that even without a high ever, the human DNA residue in vaccines is causing many auto-immune disorders </p>

        <p>Of course the "terrain" is everything: it's why the obese 25 year old who smokes, goes to McDonalds for her lunch break, calls out of work every other week and can't make it through the day without being tired is in a constant state of low-grade sickness (with spikes higher), while the gym-going 45 year old runner who packs a small sandwich and some veggies hasn't called out in a decade still feels good after work ready for the gym. Are they not exposed to the same pathogens which continuously run through our society?</p>

<p>id kinda like to re-do this post, and make it flow better. </p>
<p>I'm still trying to work out the nuts and bolts of how all this works, but the more times i try to articulate what i am seeing, the more clear the model in my mind becomes. </p>
<p>trying to understand vaccines and immunity is truly the most difficult thing i have ever tried to learn, partially because its so political. </p>
