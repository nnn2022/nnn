        <p>Nobody bothered to ask her if she was eligible for the vaccine, or to prove eligibility. If there were actual shortages, you bet your ass they would. </p>
<p>The entire phased system was put into place because shortages of the vaccine, and high demand, would have made distributing it a real shitshow without it. But apparently demand hasn't been as high as anticipated, and the supply is adequate, so I've heard many accounts of people just showing up out-of-turn and getting it, and nobody caring. </p>
<p>Hell, I keep getting emails telling me I can come in and get vaccinated, even though I'm in the lowest priority group (I'm over 50, but not fat, and have no health conditions; nor do I live with anybody in a high-risk group, like this woman does). I still have no intention of getting it, but anybody who really wants it can. So while she's kind of pathetic, she's not guilty, and no penance is required here.</p>

        <p>It seems like anyone who wants one can get one already where I am. I have friends in their 30s who arenâ€™t in healthcare who have gotten it.</p>
<p>The fact is people donâ€™t want it. If they did, to the extent that the media claims, they would be desperately lining up outside of the vaccination sites hoping someone canceled their appointment.</p>
<p>There was a drive-up covid testing site in my town for a while too that I drove past at least 3 or 4 times, and same thing, I never saw a single car in the parking lot. Thankfully itâ€™s gone now.</p>
<p>The scarcity narrative driven by the media is only for marketing purposes. Itâ€™s one of the oldest tricks in the book.</p>
