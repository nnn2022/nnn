    <strong>this “pandemic” is ruining kids’ lives</strong>
    <p><p>i never post on here,  but i’m just so frustrated and need somewhere to rant. i’m a high school senior and volleyball player. normally, high school volleyball is a fall sport, but we started the season at the beginning of february and it goes through near the end of this month. i also play volleyball on a club team, so i’m currently apart of 2 separate teams, with 2 different sets of girls. </p>
<p>a girl on my club team tested positive yesterday, monday. i had a tournament with that team on sunday, so i was exposed or whatever. i was instructed to tell my highschool coach, and though i didn’t want to, i did just because i knew he’d find out from others if not from me, and i’d likely get in a lot of trouble. so i texted him today with the situation, and a bit later my high school nurse called me and asked me some questions, and then told me she’d call me back soon. 
she called me back half an hour later, telling me that i have to quarantine for 14 days. even if i produce a negative test before then, i cannot return. how does that make any sense??? (14 days from now, our season is over). i’m a senior, i’ve been on this high school team for all 4 years, and i played my last high school game ever last night without even knowing it. i have to miss my senior night that i’ve been looking forward to for 4 years. i’ve been in tears over this for 3 hours now. it’s just so frustrating that unjustified rules regarding a virus with a 99.997% survival rate for people my age is ruining my senior year and there’s nothing i can do about it. i missed an entire semester of junior year, haven’t been to a single in person day of senior year and won’t go to one, won’t have a prom, won’t have a graduation, and now won’t even have a senior night, the one thing i thought i’d get.</p></p>

        <p>I’m sorry. But don’t just vent on here. Organize with like-minded students. Petition the leaders of your school relentlessly and with righteous indignation, tell them what you just told us and demand an end to the insanity.</p>

        <p>The Asch conformity experiments: psychologists showed you could get people to stay quiet and assent to obviously incorrect things if a bunch of people around them all agreed on those incorrect things. But when just one other person in the room (planted by the experimenters) spoke up and dissented, it was enough that most of the experimental subjects then felt brave enough to speak up. There are more of you than you think. Be the spark that gets them to speak up. Posting anonymously helps a tad, but what you do in meat space matters more.</p>

        <p>I am decades older than you but I really feel bad for you and many other kids your age. You're being robbed of an important part of your life. Just keep your head up and try to stay positive. There are many people on your side and outraged at at how so-called "adults" have handled this whole situation to rob kid's needed experiences.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear this. If it's any consolation, I too missed my senior night and prom, back in 2004. Not because of a pandemic, obviously, but because that shit was lame. You're probably not missing much on that front. But missing your sports and in-person school is total bullshit. You should teepee your principal's house, for real.</p>

        <p>that last part made me laugh, sounds like a good idea. i’d rather hit the governor’s mansion though. and to be fair, i wasn’t going to go to prom anyway. i went to hoco sophomore year, and that was enough for me. not my scene. but i’d still like the option to go, you know. and for everyone else to be able to go</p>

        <p>I do work, but not enough hours/high enough wage to really be affected by taxes. However I’m very involved in politics/economics for someone my age and know a good bit about all that. The more I learned and the more research I did about politics, economics, and our government, the more anti-government I became</p>

        <p>What they've done to you is the most unfair thing I've ever heard of.</p>
<p>I still have several memories from my last two years in high school.  They weren't at home alone on a zoom call.  </p>

        <p>I really feel for you.  Being robbed of your senior year is a serious injustice.  I feel so lucky I graduated before any of this mess.  Grade 12 had a lot of the best memories of my life so far.  It would be one thing if we really were in a deadly pandemic that ravaged the world; okay yeah shit happens and that in itself would be a unique growth experience.  But this isn’t anything about a pandemic; it’s a government brainwashing the masses with a false narrative.  I think for that reason this is actually harder to deal with; because we’re aware here of how unnecessary and stupid this all is.  Like it’s one thing when there’s an inevitable natural disaster but it’s something entirely different when the cause of your suffering is someone else’s
maliciousness/hysteria projected on you</p>

        <p>I posted this two days ago so here's my stance </p>
<p>I'm 16years old in the beginning I believed that mask up save lives and all that but after I read what cuamo did I became disgusted then Immediately after biden got elected and then stuff starts opening up I knew something wasn't right and after 1 year of online school I noticed I've changed for the worse I'm usually outgoing and shit like that but know I feel out of place and not want to be seen like the nightkin in fallout newvegas I don't turn my camera on in "school" it just sucks and I feel like if I talk bad about the vaccine I'm the white devil and how dare they question the wise teachers for saying I don't want to get the vaccine because it feels rushed  and saying we should have regular school back but I'm just a dumbass kid who doesn't know shit</p>

        <p>Sorry, sister. That's terrible to hear. I'm thankful society didn't self-immolate like this when I was a teenager. That would have been rough. </p>
<p>Hang in there. You still have a lot of good years ahead of you.</p>

        <p>That's so unfair! I'm not in my last year of high school just yet, but I hope this is done by then. I play saxophones in band, and I haven't had any bands or music anything to speak of for the last year. I hope to god I can do it all one more time before I leave but I feel so bad for the people in the year above, they went to their last ever rehearsal (we didn't even get to do the concert) without even knowing. It's so frustrating because we can see how unnecessary this all is and it just makes it more painful. Nobody cares about us though, I've learned that much through this.</p>
