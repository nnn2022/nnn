    <strong>The Myth Of East Asian counter pandemic success</strong>
    <p><p>I see lots of people mentioning the success of East Asian countries in tackling the COVID cases, and how they are opening up again; this is bullshit, the anti-pandemic effort of Asian cities, especially in Singapore and Hong Kong, have proven to be failures despite how the govts try to spin they're 'successful'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>I'll speak for my place, Hong Kong. We have one of the strictest restrictions in the world, and our govt likes to play the "Zero COVID" strategy to justify these restrictions; here's some of them</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-Must wear mask everywhere outdoors and indoors (except at home)</p>
<p>-Restaurants must sit only 4</p>
<p>-Gathering of only 4</p>
<p>-Contract tracking app or information required in restaurants and shops</p>
<p>-Bars, gyms are closed or will close soon unless they adhere to stupid restrictions (see below)</p>
<p>-Parks are locked down with tapes</p>
<p>Failure to do so in accordance of above will net you a fine of 5K HKD or more, which is equal to 1/3 to 1/4 of the average wage here, a big amount.</p>
<p>These restrictions not only damaged our businesses and economy but also were INEFFICIENT. Before the tightening up of the restrictions, the cases were stable, much like after the restrictions. It seems that our govts just hate small businesses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Our government has recommended stupid 'solutions' to 'problems', namely some of them:</strong></p>
<p>-Bars not allowed to reopen unless customers drink through a tube with a mask</p>
<p>-Gyms not allowed to reopen unless customers wear a mask when exercising</p>
<p>-Wear a mask inside home toilet because supposedly sewage systems spread virus</p>
<p>-1/3 of students to return to school, despite the fact that most cases don't happen at schools</p>
<p>-Lists every vaccination death as unrelated, but lists 'with covid' deaths as COVID deaths (Majority of them were chronic illness + very old age)</p>
<p>-Still force masks after TWO vaccine shots, because "there's a chance you may still be infected/spread virus"</p>
<p>-Mixing vaccines, namely SinoVac and BioNTech mRNA</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With zero cases for the second day, our government is considering to extend these measures to 2 weeks, in order to attempt for a "zero COVID" strategy here, but we all know it'll fail.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We have the highest mask compliance in the world and one of the most scared population in the world, and among the lowest cases but also one of the strictest laws in the world; what does that tell you? RESIST. Don't comply, because that's how you get heavier restrictions hit your ass.</p></p>

        <p>This pandemic stopped being a health crisis long ago, if it ever was.</p>
<p>My country is pretty much the same as yours.</p>
<p>It is a political and economical plan to change the way of life in the whole world.</p>
<p>We have been with masks and lockdowns and shit for a year now and no improvement whatsoever. Covid is still with us. Meanwhile they are wrecking everything else.</p>

        <p>Correct.  Variants are queued up and ready to be used as excuses to further push back reopenings and possible reversing the easing of restrictions... as the vaccination experiment yields results far short of the 95% efficacy lie told to the experimental lab rats being coerced into participating in a test of unapproved serums being called "vaccines".</p>

        <p>Same is advocated here in Austria. By a young premier minister, who never saw any people getting sick by this virus. 
The put more and more force on masks and school children with their tests and all. 
And they keep doing so, even most of old and endangoured people are vaccinated.</p>

        <p>How can people say Asia is successful at countering pandemics when almost all the new viruses come from Asia. With the exception of mers I canâ€™t think of any new virus from anywhere other then Asia</p>
