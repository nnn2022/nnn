        <p>Someone on my local FB page posted complaining about the service from our urgent care.</p>
<p>She went in, surrounded by actually sick people, for three hours and then when she asked for a Covid test due to possible exposure they turned her down because they've struggled to keep stock of tests and she was bad mouthing them (on the post). </p>
<p>Thankfully several people jumped in like "you aren't sick, why are you getting tested ?"</p>
<p>That particular urgent care is our only local one in a very small town... To get to another you're taking the highway, one into the neighboring state.. has now closed to all but respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>So if my kid, say, busts his chin and needs stitches or I get a UTI .. I'm going to have to travel further to be seen if our doc office isn't open that day. It's bullshit.</p>
<p>Also on that FB post someone said she <em>was</em> sick with respiratory symptoms (coughing, hacking, fever, etc) and went in and was waiting for an hour <em>in a packed waiting room</em> and "thank goodness by Covid test was positive ! I would have been putting everyone there at risk ! They didn't tell me to wait in the car or anything !!" </p>
<p>Bitch you're a grown ass adult they shouldn't have to tell you how to not get others sick EVEN IN A DOCTORS OFFICE WAITING ROOM... Almost as if she WANTED to have Covid and infect others if you ask me.</p>
