    <strong>Just curious: In what situation would you wear a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>The major arguments against masks seem to be that they are inconvenient or uncomfortable, don’t work well enough, and are a violation of civil liberties. 
There are also arguments that the virus isn’t that bad, that it only kills the elderly, or that it isn’t real. </p>
<p>But in what circumstances would you wear a mask? </p>
<p>For example, would you wear one if enough scientific evidence came out saying it prevented the spread of the virus? What sources would you trust? </p>
<p>Would you wear one if it protected the wearer from getting sick, rather than protecting others?</p>
<p>Would you wear one if it was a different virus that killed young people more often and was effective to prevent the spread? </p>
<p>Assuming they worked against this fictional virus, how deadly would it have to be to wear one?</p>
<p>Would you wear one if the government had endorsed them from the beginning instead of changing their mind and going from recommending against them to recommending them? </p>
<p>I’m not here to argue about the masks. Your opinion is your own. I just want to know if there would be a circumstance, in another world, another situation, another pandemic, where you would consider wearing them appropriate?</p></p>

        <p>if people were dropping dead in the streets, i might consider wearing one</p>
<p>if this thing was anywhere near as deadly as claimed, no dictated orders would be necessary, for the same reason that i don't play in traffic.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t wear one, in any situation, unless maybe I was sick, but when I’m sick I usually just stay home and don’t go anywhere anyway. The problem is, I HAVE to wear one. I am in Southern Ontario Canada and masks are mandated EVERYWHERE. If you go into a store claiming you have a condition as to why you can’t wear one, any store or business will call a by-law officer and they can come and determine if you are telling the truth or not, and if not you get fined. They also have hired security in some places for this reason. I actually have a friend that did this and they were fined! I think everybody should have the right to a CHOICE. I don’t think it’s acceptable to make someone like myself, who has been healthy throughout all of this, and is in a low risk category wear a mask for absolutely no reason other than to make others feel safe. If I had the choice, it’s a no from me.</p>

        <p>Never. If I’m sick I stay home or far away from others. And if this was some super deadly terrifying virus I’d just be staying home. </p>
<p>I have medical issues and struggle with masks, I’m not giving up my health and safety to give others the illusion of safety they’re so desperately wanting.</p>

        <p>As long the virus is as mild it's now, I won't support any restrictions or lockdown including mandatory masks. The virus has 99,8%+ survival chance.</p>
<p>If it was more severe like the Spanish flu, Ebola or plague I would support being more careful, if it were evidence for it worked.</p>

        <p>If I were to rob a bank I'd probably wear one. </p>
<p>On a more serious note, I do wear a mask. It's actually a bandana, but it stops people from giving me crap about it. I must have heard of at least 50 people that I know, or know through someone, that have gotten covid. Absolutely none of them described it as any worse than a flu. None were hospitalized or anything(which is kind of misleading because I work in a prison hospital and some of them were inmates so technically they were already hospitalized). I'm not doubting that 200k people have died, but I am curious how many of them would have died if they had merely caught a regular flu or pneumonia. Also, the state I live in has had a state-wide mandate for almost the entire time and we're still getting cases so it doesn't seem like they're really even that effective.</p>

        <p>Not in my experience. Everytime someone left the prison they were isolated for 2 weeks upon returning. I'm not high enough on the chain to look at reports. I basically just make sure no one kills themself in the middle of the night.</p>

        <p>I have to wear one when I am on the floor of the hospital at work, and while entering/exiting the building.  Beyond that, I would wear one if there was any credible evidence they do anything except look stupid.  The whole "you wear a seatbelt bc the government tells you to, masks are the same!" is bullshit.  I wear a seatbelt because my car beeps otherwise and it fucking annoys me.  Chase me around with a beeper if you want me to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>You left out the main mask problem for me. They are psychologically disturbing, and dehumanizing. </p>
<p>They prohibit proper social interactions and promote fear in stead of friendliness. It is seeing others in masks that bothers me much more than wearing a mask myself. </p>
<p>I actually do believe psychological health is super important, even more important then physical health. If you have psychological and mental well-being you are always better equipped to handle physical health issues, or any other negative curveballs life throws at you.</p>
<p>I would never wear a mask unless visiting somewhere like a cancer unit. If I’m feeling sick, I’ll just stay home. 
Masks are never worth the psychological drawbacks. <a href="https://culturalanalysis.net/2020/07/09/phenomenology-of-the-face/">here is just one article </a></p>
