        <p>When you say it's a hoax, It's impressive how many people judge us non-believers of the virus itself.</p>
<p>No, dear. I do believe the virus exists.</p>
<p>What is a hoax is the overreaction to a problem that is purposely not being dealt with due proportion to the real danger of the problem itself, aiming secondary evil goals that your little silly brain can't figure out, despite being so obvious.</p>

        <p>At the very beginning, the predictions were really really bad. But once the data came out that, no, this was a somewhat worse version of the seasonal flu, everything should have returned to normal. </p>
<p>INSTEAD, the goal posts had already been moved way, way down the field. Every news site plastered with case numbers, death counters, huge swaths of red over a diagram of the earth.  Places like Amazon, Microsoft, P&amp;G, Zoom, any toilet paper manufacturer, etc., all immediately had a huge vested interest in keeping this thing going. There was no incentive for any government to take their foot off the gas, they were getting the subservience they could hardly dream of and all they had to do was keep pumping out new restriction after new restriction. </p>
<p>Shit, half of /r/Coronavirus still can’t tell me what the lockdowns are actually supposed to accomplish. Eradication? That is simply never going to happen. Vaccine? Except those pesky variants. Flattening the curve? 0 hospitals in the world overwhelmed with covid patients currently.</p>

        <p>I mean there are people on our side that believe the virus is possibly fake and that viruses can't actually kill people and aren't contagious. I know them painting all of us in that brush is a fallacy but there are those people here. I tried to argue with one just today that truly believed based upon a single experiment over 100 years ago that viruses are magically made inside a body, that they can't be contagious, and that they aren't deadly.</p>

        <p>I understand that and tried to listen at first but parroting information that is clearly wrong is not helpful either. They push prospective people away and gives a little legitimacy to the other side. Most importantly, it spreads more misinformation which we should all be against, no matter what side it comes from.</p>

        <p>I have a personal reason to believe the virus actually exists.</p>
<p>I caught covid in mid october last year, it was probably the most mild flu of my live. It lasted at most 2 days and it was more like a beggining of a flu that makes you wonder ''Am I getting sick? Lets wait to see''</p>
<p>But it was no more than this, despite the fact that I lost my sense of smell and taste. Like really lost it. 3 months of absolutely no tasting or smelling anything and I've never had this symptom out of a flu. Did the blood test to detect antibodies and it came out positive.</p>
<p>When I finally could smell and taste things again, I quickly noticed that everything had the same weird smell and taste like 20 day old kitchen oil or something.. Turns out I developed <strong>parosmia</strong>, a condition where the sense of taste and smell gets totally twisted up.</p>
<p>I cannot enjoy food or candy anymore because the smells and tastes are very unpleasant... lets see how long it goes...</p>

        <p>With states opening up and showing no significant difference in covid deaths than similar states that are still going hard on restrictions, it's clear none of those restrictions are saving lives.</p>
<p>When you then consider all the second-order effects of lockdown, over-reacting to covid has almost certainly cost more lives than under-reacting would have.</p>

        <p>doesn't that mean early in the pandemic, when states closed and death rates went down, be proof that the lockdown was effective? and now that we have antibody treatments, vaccines (most of the vulnerable have been vaccinated), people still masking/social distancing, available ICU beds and respirators, it obviously means that with or without lockdowns,  death rates will be low.</p>

        <p>This has to do with population density. Take New Jersey: because NJ is the most densely populated state, of course the numbers are going to be more alarming than Idaho or Wyoming (for example). Suggesting that each state is so directly comparable is disingenuous.</p>
<p>If you want a better picture of lockdowns vs. no lockdowns, look at the cases and casualty rates of Sweden, who didn't do anything (857,401 cases / 13,621 deaths) and Norway, who did (102,379 cases / 684 deaths)</p>

        <p>The fact that you somehow don't see how directly you're contradicting yourself is seriously alarming.</p>
<p>&rt; This has to do with population density. </p>
<p>&rt; look at the cases and casualty rates of Sweden, who didn't do anything and Norway</p>
<p>Sweden has more than double the population of Norway.  Sweden has 10 cities with more than 100,000 population, Norway has 4.  So is it because of population density or is it because of lockdowns?  Also, a 1 second glance at /r/sweden would inform you that they did have restrictions, did enforce mask wearing, did limit social gatherings, etc.  Your ignorance is somehow ignorant.</p>

        <p>You act like surgeons don’t have surgeries that last over hours upon hours.  They’ve been wearing masks I’ll go out on a bunch and say before 2000 masks were required during surgery. So over 20 years of doctors wearing masks for surgeries that last anywhere up to 8 hours (if not longer, sure most surgeries are 1-3 hour long) and not a single case of a doctor dying from it or complications.</p>

        <p>Lmao yeah because the virus cares if you get paid a lot of money.    Let’s say doctors get better health care than the average person how does that prevent bacteria build up in a mask?? Why would a sterile environment matter?   You don’t make any sense.  You’re arguing the bacteria is coming from our mouths but sterile environments nope no bacteria in our mouth.  Okay bud keep making up shit excuses</p>
<p>You know what I’m curious what your excuse will be for this one. For the past year every healthcare worker has to wear their mask (some hospitals required n95 and a surgical mask so two masks) for 12 hours.  No complications no deaths.  Let’s see your excuse this time.</p>

        <p>Old people wouldn't be abandoned, filled with constant fear, and told the virus is basically a death sentance for them.  Stress, abandonment, and a lack of the emotional support they need means a weaker immune system and less of the will to fight it.</p>
<p>Likewise, fewer people indoors getting fat and missing out on life.  Less exposure to the sun, less vitamin D, less exercise.  </p>
<p>Fewer people dealing with the stress of job loss, the loss of small businesses, etc.  Leading to poorer nutrition, higher rates of stress and depression, and due to social distancing lacking much of the support they need.</p>
<p>Wearing masks that for every person they might "lessen" potential exposure to the virus, keeps another person exposed to it despite our immune systems best attempts to purge itself of it.</p>
<p>All for a disease with over a 99% chance of survival even with us doing all these things that both demolish our immune systems and will to fight.  Imagine if we did none of that...  oh right, the whole Texas thing that's confusing everyone, I wonder if the things I mentioned above might have something to do with it?</p>

        <p>It doesn't, it keeps you exposed if you have it, which interference with your bodies natural ability to expel it and thus fight it.</p>
<p>Imagine you're in a tent and find a bunch of mosquitos got in and instead of taking an effort to shoo them out, you instead decide you don't want to risk exposing the other campers, so you instead, close the tent trapping them inside with you, making no attempts to remove them.  You're going to get a whole lot more mosquito bites.</p>
<p>The mask traps the virus close to your face.  You breathe, cough or sneeze it out, to then, immediately breathe it back in, along with all the other bacteria that's been building up in your mask.  </p>
<p>Where as you might have fought the virus off without the mask, you're instead helping the virus to survive and multiply in your system by hampering your bodies ability to expel the virus.  Sneezing, coughing, etc, is not caused by the virus, it's caused by the body fighting the virus.</p>

This just gives me circumstantial evidence that masks do work.   If I witnessed all of my fellow co workers contract the disease I’d go hmm maybe masks don’t work but that’s not the case.   I’m not trying to come in here and scare people like the media.  I’m not saying we should have strict lock downs and put people in jail who don’t follow.   Sure the survival rate is high but over 1 million people are dead because of it.   1 million people died way too early because of a virus people didn’t want to take seriously.    People who had Covid are having long term effects and we still don’t fully understand what all the long term effects will be.      Everyone wants to go back to normal but this isn’t the common cold.</p>

        <p>I think that if we didnt have the media reminding us all the time that we are in a '''deadly pandemic''' and specially if the cycle threshold of the PCR tests were below 30 in every single test performed (which is the right thing to do), we would have much, much less deaths attributed to covid-19.</p>
<p>Those are the two pillars of why this '''pandemic''' keeps rolling: the shitshow of the PCR tests and the media constant propaganda.</p>

        <p>The pandemic saw a rise in armchair experts, people who had never  stepped foot in a laboratory suddenly learning about PCR and thinking,  as in true crime dramas, that they had cracked the case wide open. But the interpretation of PCR tests for the coronavirus relies on a lot more  than a single Ct value: it depends on all of the variability, plus the type of specimen collected, whether or not samples  are pooled in a single well to save on reagents (with positive pools  being tested individually afterwards), and on pre-test probability,  meaning whether or not the person being tested has symptoms and whether  or not they were potentially exposed to the virus. The blind reliance on  Ct values unfortunately shows a misunderstanding of the complexities of  molecular diagnostics. Ct values are not elementary; they require  expertise to interpret.</p>

        <p>OK, smarty pants. Where I am, we no longer have to wear masks. People can go where we please, too. You’ll probably hate to hear that there’s been no outbreak since this started, since it goes against your fear-mongering agenda.</p>

        <p>Lmao what part of my question was fear mongering agenda? </p>
<p>I’m sure ~~vaccines~~  the 5g tracking microchips have no part in that.       I’m glad places are opening up but let’s not act like we are in the worst of it when things are getting better.    Places are opening up when we aren’t having record breaking days of positive cases/ deaths.   </p>
<p>On the flip side of that there’s people in my local nursing home who had Covid, then the vaccine, and are back in the hospital with a covid again</p>

        <p>Sweden didn't do any of that stuff and their mortality was better than the rest of Europe. How about Africa and India? The WHO said that there is no evidence lockdowns work to slow the spread of viral illness. The Canadian government said the same, as 99% of infections occur in the home or hospital settings.</p>

        <p>Yes I do. It simple really, we know that the elderly are more vulnerable to this virus. We know that social distancing and shutdown only delay people from catching it. There are people who if they catch the virus today will be fine but if they catch it in 3 or 6 months it will be lethal. Be delaying exposure you’re causing more deaths.</p>
<p>Then there are secondary issues with the lockdowns such as bankruptcies and suicides.</p>

        <p>I didn't say anything about Trump, but no I don't believe he handled it best. It was mostly left up to each individual state which caused some issues. Some states handled it better than others. Iowa never even had a mask mandate, for example.</p>
<p>Warpspeed was helpful, but people are still hesitant about the vaccines that he helped make a reality. </p>
<p>His rhetoric, including calling it a hoax, led to many deaths and an epidemic of misinformation, including this sub.</p>

        <p>Show me one pandemic in history that needed a marketing team, non-stop reminders to the public of how deadly it is, a test to figure out whether or not you have it, and happy feel good videos of medical staff performing choreographed dances in empty hospital hallways. If this were a real pandemic absolutely no one would need to be reminded of it.</p>
<p>The only person I know who got hit hard with covid is extremely overweight. Every other person I know personally who had it said they just felt sick and only went in to get tested because they had to for work.</p>
<p>If we're calling this a pandemic we might as well do the same every year for the flu.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have been sceptical since the first GitHub sequence was given to the WHO by China back in Jan 2020. Remember, this is the same country that claimed zoonotic transmission and has yet to provide a SINGLE example of an animal host that was sold at the Racoon City wet market.</p>
<p>That said, I no longer focus on that because there's something infinitely more dangerous on the horizon - ~~masks~~ vaccines.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what you're looking for, honestly. Figure 1 clearly shows SARS-CoV-2 from a human isolate. That is how viral isolation works. You have to grow them on host cells in culture and find plaques. Those virions are literally from the original host. </p>

<p>http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543926</p>
<p>Unless you're saying there is some sort of virus in Vero cells or on the nasophayngeal swabs, I really can't think of a reason why all these isolated would be similar genetically. </p>
<p>If you're looking for like electron microscopy of human autopsy patients showing covid-19, that's also available, even with sequencing confirmation... </p>

<p>Denying these are isolates of a virus is quite ignorant.</p>

        <p>If someone has an active infection that is prolific enough to make them sick why can't the virus be isolated directly from the host? The images in that figure are of vero cell cultures not a human sample. Another question why are monkey kidney cells the best culture medium for a human respiratory disease pathogen?</p>

        <p>I did in my recent post above. The document you're referring to is from ~~December 2019~~ February 2020 and you are vastly misinterpreting its meaning.</p>
<p>This explains it well: https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-cdc-idUSKBN27633R</p>
<p>Basically what it's saying is that a readily available viral stock wasn't available at the time in ~~December 2019~~ February 2020 so they used RNA matching what was submitted by Chinese scientists. There are now hundreds of stocks of cultured SARS-CoV-2 and it's even used in one of my research projects by my collaborator.</p>

        <p>IMO Covid19 very well may be a total and complete hoax. IMO they have no proven it exists, and the policies being designed specifically to allow false-positives from PCR tests which go positive on old Flu\Virus DNA fragments indicates it is very possible Covid-19 is a PCR test, not a disease.</p>
<p>I rarely discuss this though. it is a nuanced and detailed discussion and most people are totally incapable of nuance or detail on any topic, let alone this propagandized PsyOp.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even if covid-19 exists and is 100% real, Covid-19 is STILL a hoax. It is a hoax to pretend something is not what it is.</p>

        <p>Watch the first minute of the video and he explains who he is and what he does. He basically explains exactly what you’re saying and links it to patents that were suspiciously gained regarding the coronavirus and the way it is tested for. I understand you’ve seen other videos that echo what you believe and I think you’re right too. It was just an interesting interview that was different from any other I’ve seen on the subject. I heard from someone that he had brought lawsuits against certain people for illegally gaining patents on certain things that should never have been granted. It goes fairly deep into the whole situation and it was a worthwhile watch. I’d love to see it on MSM but that’s not going to happen any time soon if ever.</p>

        <p>I need to jump in here and clarify something. </p>
<p>Where are you getting the 99.98% survival rate? I come in peace, I think it’s sad the world will never be the same and that this has been a bit overblown. Our response and the pro-lockdowns and pro-mask majority will undoubtedly screw over the rest of our society indefinitely, and I guess unfortunately it is what it is. </p>
<p>But I don’t know where that survival rate comes from, any specific sources would be great. I’m all for advocating for “no new normal” but this number just doesn’t seem accurate.</p>

        <p>The WHO says we shouldn't call it by it's official name because "SARS" scares Asians. They call it "the COVID-19 virus". Feel free to file an official protest with them.</p>
<p>From the WHO's website:</p>
<p>"What name does WHO use for the virus?</p>
<p>"From a risk communications perspective, using the name SARS can have unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some populations, especially in Asia which was worst affected by the SARS outbreak in 2003. </p>
<p>"For that reason and others, WHO has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus” when communicating with the public.  Neither of these designations are intended as replacements for the official name of the virus as agreed by the ICTV.</p>

        <p>You need to stop taking hits off PMSNBCNN and try to make your way back toward reality.</p>
<p>There are far less deaths than what's reported. Unless of course you consider people who were shot, drown, or died in a car accident to be valid COVID deaths. There's a vast difference between dying *WITH* COVID and dying from it. The reported numbers are those who (probably) died WITH the WuFlu.</p>
<p>&rt;If someone dies <strong>with</strong> COVID-19, we are counting that as a <strong>COVID-19 death</strong>. </p>
<p>-Dr. Birx, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator </p>
<p>And, by the way, that's not how you calculate survival rates. Maybe read the CDC link I sent and you'll perhaps understand. If only 10% of the population is susceptible to a disease and 10% of those who get it die, the survival rate is not 90%, it's 99%. 90% survive because they never even get it, and another 9% (90% of the 10%) survive even after getting it. CFR, IFR, and survival rate are not the same thing.</p>
<p>The math you are using is the same idiotic math the MSM-DNC used to calculate the "85% of Americans approved of U.S. President Joe Biden's first speech before a joint session of Congress" garbage stat. Even far left leaning DNC PR site Snopes acknowledges this is absolute misinformation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;This stat refers to the approval rating among Americans who watched the speech, not the country as a whole. While 85% of viewers did approve of the speech, according to CBS News, the majority of those viewers were Democrats. </p>

        <p>That would be true if you treated everyone as a clone. In reality, people are different. Most people have a functioning immune system that can easily fight it off. The number of (falsified) deaths seems high now because of the harvesting effects. As people continue to test positive but fewer people die, you will see the death rate continue to plummet.</p>
