        <p>I've done my research and have this concluded it is safe. The clinical trial have deemed it safe. The people who have gotten it have all been doing well and hospitalizations are down 40 percent in my area in the short time we've had it.</p>

        <p>Clinical Trials? It usually takes 7-10 years to pass a medicine or vaccine. This took a few months. And didn’t this same technology kill tons of animals a few years ago, early in trials?</p>

        <p>I get why you're wary if a vaccine developed this quickly. But you do have to understand that  countries diverted everything toward a getting a vaccine that would work ready. That "same" technology was actually being tested and has since been changed and refined. That's the simplest way to put and you can look into credible sources as you please.</p>

        <p>“The people who have gotten it are all doing well.”  ?!?!?! These people would probably disagree. Mind you I don’t care what you do. But don’t say you’re done your research and then say that the people who have gotten it are doing well. Because you’re wrong. </p>
<p>A 58-year-old Washington woman took Pfizer’s first dose of COVID vaccine at about 9 a.m. on Jan. 4 at the medical center where she worked as a housekeeper and one hour later began to complain of nausea and feeling like she was going to pass out.

<p>A 56-year-old man who worked at an extended care community facility in Florida received a second dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine on Jan. 12 and was found “unresponsive,” within one hour. He was pronounced “brain dead” the same day and died two days later. [944595]</p>
<p>A 58-year-old woman walked to her car 20 minutes after receiving the first Pfizer vaccine dose in the state of Virginia on Jan. 30. According to a VAERS report, she was leaning out of her car saying that she couldn’t breathe and began vomiting. She was administered two epi-pens and an epinephrine gas but became unresponsive shortly after she was put in an ambulance, where a “large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patient’s lungs,” and she was pronounced dead at the emergency department. [989006]</p>
<p>A 23-year-old New York man received a first dose of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine on Jan. 17. “Patient developed 104.4 temp approximately 48 hours after being given the vaccine. I treated him with antibiotics, IV fluids, cooling methods,” stated one report filed by a physician. “Unfortunately, he suffered a cardiac arrest on 1/21/21 in the early morning and expired.” [960841]</p>
<p>A 28-year-old New Jersey man was due for his second dose of Pfizer’s vaccine Jan. 11 but was found unresponsive at his workplace in the hospital. His pupils were “fixed and dilated,” according to a VAERS report, and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. [943397]</p>
<p>A 33-year-old woman died on Jan. 28 following her first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine. The report filed by a physician stated that “16 hours after receiving the vaccine (the) patient was found dead at her home.” [1000669]</p>
<p>A 43-year-old man who received Moderna’s COVID vaccine on Jan. 8 in New York died the following day. [933578]</p>
<p>A 43-year-old woman with no pre-existing medical conditions and no known medications died six hours after receiving Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine on Jan. 13, according to a VAERS report made by a pharmacist. “An autopsy was not performed. The cause of death was unknown, death unexplained. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected,” the report stated. [965441]</p>
<p>A 48-year-old Tennessee woman experienced a temperature, nausea and vomiting after her first dose of Moderna’s COVID vaccine on Jan. 30 and died Feb. 1. [994913]</p>
<p>A 49-year-old Alabama woman had her first dose of Moderna’s vaccine on Jan. 15 and died within hours after suffering a seizure and heart attack. [950057]</p>
<p>A 53-year-old California man who received an injection of Pfizer’s COVID vaccine on Jan. 4 began to feel unwell immediately, according to one VAERS report. “He went right home and went to bed.” The man slept intermittently and began vomiting and developed trouble breathing. He was taken by ambulance to an urgent care facility, where became increasingly “agitated,” he continued vomiting and was dehydrated. The following morning, according to the VAERS report, “The patient stated that he couldn’t breathe, and his mind was racing.” He died at 10:15 am on Jan. 6 and, according to the VAERS report filed by his brother, “it was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine.” [934968]</p>
<p>A 58-year-old Virginia pharmacist developed fatigue and shortness of breath hours after receiving Moderna’s second dose vaccine on Jan. 21. He was hospitalized two days later as his condition worsened, but he repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19. He died on Feb. 5. [1006168]</p>
<p>A 52-year-old Hawaiian woman died two hours after receiving Moderna’s first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, after having a stroke. [930910]

<p>There’s also quite a few records of miscarriages and Bell’s palsy. Also recommend looking into the company’s that are making the vaccine like Johnson and Johnson.  They have already done horrible experiments to humankind and proved that they don’t care.</p>

        <p>As long as you don't coerce medical devices or treatments on others it's fine.  If you want to force medicine on others, you should be liable for their medical bills.</p>

        <p>I think people should get medical treatments. I won't force them on them though regardless of what I think. Being liabel for their bills is a bit of a stretch though.</p>
