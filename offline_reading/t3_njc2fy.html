    <strong>Questions regarding research steps taken for the coronavaccines (more precisely the mRNA ones)</strong>
    <p><p>Ciao,</p>
<p>More unknowns than knowns regarding the vaccinations in motion right now.
One thing that I have found quite interesting is the push for the mRNA vaccine. I don't mean the fasttracking in particular but more the pivot that is ongoing.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong; J&amp;J and AstraZeneca are 'conventional' vaccines. They use deceased adenovirus' strains from some primate. I have a lot less issues with these, I can see the use in those.
Lot of talk about these two; blood clots, pausing of etc.</p>
<p>Not much talk about Moderna and/or Pfizer, especially in the mainstream yet these are the vaccines with the most unknowns and downright warnings. Mostly concerning the deaths of pretty much all animals used for testing earlier SARS and MERS vaccines, so I've heard.</p>
<p>The pivot I mentioned earlier is clearly visible; the European Union has bought 1.4 billion Pfizer mRNA vaccines for future use. Talk about mixing Astra and J&amp;J with Moderna and Pfizer. Agenda looks to be focussing alot on, more than anything, getting the mRNA-vaccines into arms.</p>
<p>With this pivot getting visible, some questions:
Does anyone have info on these dying animals (ferrets I believe) in earlier mRNA-vaccine tests, especially for SARS and MERS?
Does anyone have info on wether or not the mRNA-vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer have been tested on animals?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>Antibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE, is the reason the animals died in coronavirus vaccine testing. For the most part, they were fine after getting the vaccine, but when they were exposed to the virus, their immune systems overreacted, causing a cytokine storm which killed them. This was the problem with the dengue vaccine, which was used in people.</p>
<p>mRNA shots have also killed animals, and they think it has to do with the uncertainty of the dose and its unpredictability. Everybody is different, and some bodies will react more strongly and produce more than the "desired" amount of spike proteins (or whatever the mRNA has coded for).</p>

        <p>Excellent question as it is something I am looking for too. If you find anything credible, give me a shout and I'll do likewise.
There was a video from Texas legislature the other day but I haven't really examined it.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9792931264">AP News</a> both Moderna and Pfizer went through animal testing, and passed. They did it during an overlapping period with human testing, as testing needed to be sped up if we wanted to approve the vaccines, so instead of doing animal testing and then human testing both were conducted at around the same time. Bit riskier for the human test subjects, but both trials were successfully passed before the full vaccine rollouts began.</p>
