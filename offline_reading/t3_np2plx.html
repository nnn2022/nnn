    <strong>What's going to happen ?</strong>
    <p><p>What do you think is going to happen to the vaccinated in the next year ? I read somewhere that mass deaths are going to happen in 2023. Some others say it's going to cause infertility worldwide. Thoughts ?</p></p>

        <p>I don't think anyone knows.</p>
<p>Alex Jones says it is a weapon intended to kill everyone.  He's right about alot, but I think that is a stretch.</p>
<p>Anthony Fraudci says it is the safest thing ever.  He's wrong about alot.  And he is wrong here.</p>
<p>This rushed and untested treatment is almost certainly higher risk to people under 50 than COVID itself - simply because COVID itself won't cause death for 99.97% of us and won't cause any long term damage to 99% of us.  The vaccine only has to harm more than that for it to be a bad choice.  The stories we're seeing show the immediate toxicity to be near that bar.  It is very reasonable to guess a couple of long term side effects could easily hit 1/100 people.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe people will start dying or be infertile or start dropping like flies. It is a possibility with cytokine storm happening, where immune system goes into overdrive when introduced to the virus the second time. </p>
<p>But I think the pandemic was basically money motivated, i don’t think anyone cares about people or found it beneficial to start killing them, it seems like a plan that would fail fast.</p>
<p>No, this whole thing in my opinion, was motivated because of money and the pandemic was needed because money had to change pockets. Look at the people who benefitted the most because of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Can't you make more money by making a large fraction of the population sick with chronic ailments? A win win for big pharma (they get to sell more "treatments") and big government (they get to amass further power) and blame it on those anti-vaxers or the VaRiaNts</p>

        <p>I think they are going to die. They will start dying and they will blame it on a new variant, the vaccines are "failing" at solving when it's the vaccine itself causing it and will turn and blame the unvaccinated. Hate to be this morbid, but I swear I am seeing subtle health effects in many people I know who have been vaccinated, they don't seem as lively, [yeah I know this can be from endless lock down]. People look different to me who got it, it's subtle. They don't seem as WELL. I notice some of this stuff because I have been sick for years with extreme autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>The fact they are pushing these vaxx so much makes me suspicious. I read the Deagle predictions YEARS ago, before Covid hit, and this seems to explain them. For a Great RESET to happen which they have announced to us, I think something this horrible will be used. If the system fails, my chances of making it are low due to being disabled. I don't want to lose almost everyone I know either. :( Sterility will come along with it.</p>

        <p>I'm an Aspie that notices details and I have been very chronically ill for years some with rare scary stuff that is appearance oriented. I will add the caveat outside of very few masked meetings I have seen very few people and see people on Zoom but I saw these same people on Zoom prior to the vaxx.</p>
<p>Here's my list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They look more grey in coloring, like not the same coloring. Not completely green around the gills but the edge of it. This one has me worried the most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look more tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eyes look more rheumy, like glazed over. [reminds me of my own eyes before I get a flare--I have an eye ball that goes full red, is actually an impending sign]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kind of bloated in a bad way like lymph system is not cleaning things as well. Puffy, yeah that's the word I am thinking of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People look a lot more rashy. [I am covered in severe skin rashes myself, from autoimmune diseases] One woman's face was so rash covered it shocked me and red, and there she was bragging about getting the vaxx on Zoom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice some slowing down in speech, like more mollified but this could be some of the Covid psychological effects.</p>
</li>

        <p>I warned husband the other day to be careful of people, some is psychological pressures from the amount of BS but I am wondering myself about mental effects from the vaxx on people. If it is a "mark of the beast" and I myself believe the vaxxs are spiritually evil, then it very well could change the people who take it. I am not going to be mean to any vaxxed people and think we should treat everyone with compassion but I have worried about spiritual influences of this vaxx on people too. Did you read the report about the people who said god was cut off? I also have written about how God or the Source/divinity was screaming in my own spirit not to take it. I had dreams not to. I am high risk too. I would rather die then be part of this, even the fact they are experimenting on children is enough for me to say HELL NO.</p>

        <p>Thanks for answering, this is disturbing. I’ve been kind of antisocial lately because I’ve been sick (feeling better now, I think it was just a spring sinus infection) but I’ll see if I notice anything like this next time I hang out with vaccinated friends. I don’t want to fall into confirmation bias though, if that makes sense</p>

        <p>Yeah see if you notice anything. I don't have any local close friends to hang out with. Guess it takes the decision out of my hands. Groups are meeting [well ones  that aren't banning the unvaccinated yet] and I decided to wait until the fall....to see if there is going to be a Covid 22 or  not. I think I've given up on a social life at this point outside of husband and have entered "don't care" territory. There's no one to honestly talk to about any of this IRL. [except husband]</p>

        <p>Think it will certainly kill some but maybe not as many as predicted. Think it will create many health issues (including widespread infertility) and it will be blamed on covid, carbon and our western diet. This allows for continued control of health and vaccines, climate control and total control over production of food. Who funds the vaccines, who wants to block out the sun and who owns the most farmland in US? </p>
<p>Just see what he says and does and it'll be the next thing on the agenda. How has he not been taken out by now?</p>

<p>I have narcolepsy and it developed after a run of having several viruses close together including the flu and pneumonia. If there is any chance the covid vaccine can give me an increased risk of another autoimmune disease of which I have several then I do not want to take the risk, nor subject my children to any increased chance of a loss of quality of life. We all had covid and came out the other side just fine. So for right now I don’t see the reason to take any additional risk on an experimental drug, no matter how much our school district pushes to negatively impact their education.</p>

        <p>Considering the CDC keeps putting up “Zombie Apocalypse“ stuff on their website, which if you really think about that.. It’s a government agency putting zombie stuff on their medical site.... </p>
<p>I‘d say they’ll switch on the 5G higher sending out a frequency that makes all the vaccinated lose certain brain functions making them zombie like. It won’t be the undead, it will be like highly aggressive emotionless people who can’t control their actions attacking others.</p>

        <p>Ok guys, I'm all for scrapping all of the stupid restrictions and going against the new normal, and I do believe that there some risk to the vaccines. But damn, you're stretching things way too far! If a vaccine is going to kill someone, it's going to do it quickly, it's not going to wait TWO DAMN YEARS! By that time, the antibodies from the vaccine would be long gone anyways. You are blowing the risks of the vaccines way out of proportion, same thing the media is doing to the virus itself.</p>

        <p>Actually 18 to 24 months is the time period to develope antibody dependent enhancement</p>
<p>ADE occurs when the antibodies generated during an immune response recognize and bind to a pathogen, but they are unable to prevent infection. Instead, these antibodies act as a “Trojan horse,” allowing the pathogen to get into cells and exacerbate the immune response </p>
<p>This is a major hurdle for vaccine development in the animal trials. Animal shows a robust immune response to vaccine. All looks well, 2 years later they are introduced to the virus they have been inoculated against and either get really sick or die.</p>
<p>Being the the COVID trials all but skipped the animal trials and rushed phase 1 and 2 and are currently rushing phase 3, who knows what will happen and because of the rush ADE is a real possibility.</p>
