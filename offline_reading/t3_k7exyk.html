        <p>I get what you mean because of the colours and top font but this isn't really artdeco, and soviets didn't like art deco themselves that much either only bits were inspired by it.</p>
<p>To me this looks more like a 60s cartoon, like the original scooby doo, especially the eyes and general flatness</p>

        <p>Are you sure?  Just think about it.  You honestly believe most people are swapping out for clean masks regularly?  And do you not think bacteria grows in warm damp locations such as a mask that’s been worn for hours/days without being cleaned or replaced?  There’s no way you’re not getting sick if you’re breathing in mold.  Even your god fauci said bacterial pneumonia was the killer in 1918.   Sure masks could help if worn properly, but nobody does and I believe it’s making people sick.   </p>

        <p>Thats statistics from 1918 though. In 2020 people are buying paper masks in bulk and wear a new mask everyday. People with cloth masks are washing them atleast once a week. And also people would notice quickly if there was mold in their masks.</p>

        <p>Washing once a week???  Yes we agree on that - So in a 40 hour work week plus going out for groceries and other public places, taking it off to drink/eat/smoke, touching all the public surfaces and dirty cell phones, going to the bathroom... You see no problem with that? You think that weekly wash is good hygiene?</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I’m not anti mask - I’m anti people being forced to wear them without any regulation.  I also believe most people think a mask is a replacement for a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<p>if an authority, like a police officer for example, comes up and tells you to put on a mask are you going to say no? if so, who the hell do you think you are? if you do listen to them, than your not an NPC, you just want to avoid a problem and simply do as your told.</p>
<p>what harm does it even do wearing a mask? NONE. so by wearing one you simply avoid having problems and do your part to end a pandemic, people like YOU are whats wrong with the world</p>

        <p>The constitution was not written by our current government, but men like those of us here who stood up to tyrants and authoritarian government.  They knew what the point of government was, control, so they wrote the constitution to ensure that the government they were creating would not become the one they fought against.  Unfortunately though, over the years the government has found loopholes and ways to get around the constitution, meaning many of our rights granted to us by our founders are merely a shell of what they were supposed to be.</p>
<p>One thing you stated that really scared me is that rights are granted to us by the government.  The natural rights to Life, Liberty, and Property are not granted by any government or any power other than God, we are born with these rights and no just government may take them away without due process.</p>
<p>On your point with masks, yes you are right, masks themselves are not a problem, it is mask mandates that are a problem.  Masks are a way the government is promoting a false sense of security, and a way to groom people such as yourself into shaming others for not doing what the government says.  It's obviously worked for you, you're on this subreddit wasting your time trying to convince us to do what the government says, and that we should be terrified of the big scary virus.</p>
<p>Millions of great men in our history have died so that you and I can enjoy the freedom to speak our mind, see our families, travel the world, yet in the matter of a few months people like yourself have enabled the government to strip us of these liberties all so that we can "save just one life."  You know my ancestors could've went along with the British, accepted they had authority over them, and lived under British tyranny, and saved thousands of lives by not fighting a revolution, but they realized that some things are more important than life, some things are worth dying for.  By accepting tyranny, by staying complacent while your basic natural rights are taken away from you because you don't want to be inconvenienced by being confronted by someone for not wearing a mask, you are disregarding and disgracing the great men who died for your freedoms all those years ago.  My ancestors died for the freedoms we enjoy today, the least we can do is refuse to wear a mask.</p>

<p>Loopholes, what loopholes? Where’s your source? A government needs to control, part of your “civic duty” is to OBEY THE LAW and a law is to wear your face mask when told to.

<p>Jesus, the only kind of reasonable thing you said there was “did we just go with British rule” ok cool sure I guess, But British laws were cruel and unreasonable and unthoughtful, all you have to do is wear a mask.</p>
<p>Those men also fought for the country and supported the government established today.</p>
<p>I wear a mask, if I ever go out is so I can do my part to stop a virus that I know is real because I had it.</p>
<p>What’s going to happen if you wear a mask, are you going to explode? Are you going to die a most agonizing death? No, what do you expect bad to happen from wearing a mask?</p>
<p>I can’t tell if your really this stupid or your just putting on an impression.</p>

        <p>I am not arguing store owners cannot make you wear a mask, they have the right to their property, and can remove anyone from their property for any reason.</p>
<p>So lets look at a few loopholes that the government has taken to get around the constitution, shall we?  For one, the Second Amendment.  The Right to Keep and Bear Arms Shall Not Be Infringed.  Based off of that, you would believe that any an all infringements on the right to keep and bear arms would be in violation of the Constitution, and that is what our Founders intended.  Well, the US government decided in 1936 it actually meant that they could ban civilians from owning certain types of arms, which is by definition infringing on the right to keep arms.  Lets also look at the First Amendment.  Corporations such as Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook ban certain opinions they disagree with from being shared on their websites.  Though yes, they are private companies, I would argue that they're websites are now the primary form of communication in the modern world, and therefore should be covered by the First Amendment, and I'm sure our Founders would agree.  The Constitution of 1787 was really in my opinion voided in 1861 during the Civil War.  Lincoln suspended Habeas Corpus, as well as consolidated power in the federal government and stripped those powers from individual states.  Our founders intended this nation to be a union of many states cooperating together, not states ruled by a single federal entity as we see today.</p>
<p>And this is gonna blow your mind, but what we're experiencing now is way worse than what our Founders fought a revolution over.  In Colonial America, you could still see your family, you could run a business without the government shutting it down, you could disagree with someone like yourself without them saying you're killing grandmas.  One of the main complaints our Founders had with British rule was a lack of representation in government.  If we look at our current system, we have very little representation in it.  Governor are issuing their tyrannical decrees without consulting legislatures, and without any real legal backing in either federal or state constitutions, yet what they say is the law.  Our elections are also complete frauds, as we've seen this election cycle, we have no real say in them.</p>
<p>If our Founders were alive today, they would fight another revolution, I'm sure of it.  This nation was founded on the idea of not trading liberty for security.  America was completely safe under Britain, a superpower at the time, the strongest nation on Earth, but we were not free.  Sure, we may be safe from COVID hiding away at home, but we are not free, that is for sure.  Benjamin Franklin once said, "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." That quote rings true to this day, we are giving up our liberty, our very rights that our ancestors fought so hard for, just to be safe from a virus that has a death rate under 1%, and an average death age of 80 (the average life span in America is 78 years).  Any of the great men who risked their lives by signing the Declaration of Independence would be rolling in their graves seeing this great nation today.  </p>
<p>People like you, who are complacent to tyrants, do what they are told no matter what, and trade liberty for safety are what have led this nation down this terrible path.  We are a nation founded on rebellion, we are a nation of rebels.  Oh wait, I forgot, actually standing up for yourself and your liberties requires you to stop watching Netflix all day and mindlessly scrolling social media, to give up your oh so comfortable life.  Sure, live your comfortable life, in twenty years when I'm long dead after trying to save both you and myself from these tyrants, you'll look up from your phone, and realize that you didn't do anything before it was too late, you'll realize that maybe if you had done something earlier, you would have been able to prevent this.  Our lives have become so comfortable over the last half century, that we no longer are willing to give that comfort up even when we can no longer see our families, eat out at a restaurant, be with our parents as they die in the hospital, with all of it having no end in site.  Live your comfortable life, wear your mask, do what you are told, that is your choice, our Founders also believed in self-determination, you can do what you want, but also realize that all actions have their consequences, good and bad.</p>

..........Simply being told to were a mask, is worse than a revolution? Come one, please tell me your being satirical.</p>
<p>Nothing of what your saying is even relevant to the topic, you basically agreed with me by saying stores have rights and what not. The point is that just simply listen to authorities and wear your mask because it’s not that bad.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, I’m honestly done arguing with you <em>”because you know I’m right”</em>
No, simply because your far too stubborn to change your mind and see yourself as some kind of hero for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I could care less about the masks, it's the lock downs and the massive increase of government power that bother me, the masks are simply representative of that and a very small part of that.  The easiest thing we can do to try to stop this is to refuse to comply with mask mandates. It's a lot harder to overthrow a tyrannical government preventing me from seeing my family than to not wear a mask</p>

        <p>Everything the politburo does is for our safety. We will follow the lead of the great humanitarians who kept their people's safety in mind, such as Zedong, Stalin, and Castro. Keep fighting, comrade! And remember that what the State does is for our own good!</p>

        <p>You guys are crazy and delusional. A mask isnt equal to mass genocide/killing. And I havent seen anyone die as a result of wearing a mask. What I do see is the covid death rate rising because of idiots spreading the virus. I find it funny when anti maskers try to sound smart and end up sounding more idiotic.</p>

        <p>People getting groceries, people needing to use an atm, people at school/work. And wearing a mask is to prevent the spread of germs. Obviously the virus can be passed by touch. What point were you trying to make? You sound very stupid.</p>

        <p>the point I'm trying to make is that there is no reasoning that justifies blaming the people who aren't wearing masks. First of all, you're generalizing about some conceived notion of a group of people who spread the virus hypothetically, not even referencing literal people with identities that have actual real world events happen to them. Second, you have no clue whether anyone, anywhere, is getting COVID from a person with a mask, a person without a mask, or a doorknob, whether the person is even hypothetical or not. Third, if getting COVID is so threatening to you, and it really matters as much as you say, don't stake your life on something completely unreliable, like strangers around you wearing masks; rather, do something that actually protects you, like staying home continuously or wearing a gas mask to the grocery store. If you're not even going to bother trying to protect yourself, you might as well be explicitly consenting that you are exposed to COVID, or at the very least, you forfeit the privilege of expecting me to cover my face to protect you.</p>

        <p>what you said is that you see the COVID death rate rising because of idiots spreading the virus. The word "because" denotes direct causal attribution. It's right there in the word. So yes, you did blame people for not wearing masks. That's what attribution is: it's blame. However, I agree: I do sound stupid. Specifically, I sound stupid for treating you as though you are capable of productive dialogue.</p>

        <p>&rt;I understand that</p>
<p>Ok. So you see the connection with communism then.</p>
<p>&rt;you should definitely work as a group to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>But this is a very "simple" sentiment.</p>
<p>I dont want you to drive a car, because it damages the planet.</p>
<p>So you shouldnt. Actually ... I am going to <em>make</em> you stop.</p>
<p>I also dont want you to get fat. Because then you have a bigger chance to get sick.  And that uses up the medical resources of our country. And then when somebody needs care, they cant get it, because you chose to be fat.</p>
<p>So I want you to lose weight. Actually .. I am going to MAKE you.  Because it is "for the good of the people" that you are healthy.</p>
<p>And lastly, it is very important for all of our safety that our country is able to defend itself against attack. In order to do this we need a strong military. So I would like you to go for 2 years of military service. Actually .. I am going to <em>MAKE</em> you serve for 2 years.  Because it is for the safety of our citizens.  Do you want us to be hurt?</p>
<p>So .. you can see that it is not such a black and white situation. And <em>your</em> definition of "work together to keep everyone safe" may not be the same as mine.</p>

        <p>No i dont see any connection to communism. I just said that to get yall to stop comparing a mask to an ideology/political stance. And risking someone elses heath isnt the same as someone being fat. You can be a threat to yourself but when you are trying to prevent people from helping others not get sick, you are a selfish douche bag. And stop making up stupid scenarios that have nothing to do with masks.</p>

<p>If you are fat and get sick because you are fat, maybe somebody doesnt get a hospital bed because of you and they die.</p>
<p>That <em>exact</em> argument gets used for Covid.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>But not wearing a mask, <em>when you are not infectious</em> is not risking anybody's health, is it?</p>
<p>If I am walking out in the city, <em>and I dont have the virus</em>, then I am not dangerous to anybody.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>If you want to "punish" me somehow and say I am being dangerous, then prove I am infectious with whatever test you want, and then we can talk.</p>
<p>Until then, I'm just a healthy guy walking around and I'm not a danger to anybody.</p>
<p>\&rt;Innocent until proven guilty&lt;, right?</p>

        <p>Some people dont show symptoms. And that arguement can be used for anything. You can break your toe and have to go to the doctor. And there you go again with pointless scenarios. If you are in a non crowded city then you dont need a mask as long as you stay 6 ft away from people. If it is crowded then you should use a mask. Try to come up with an arguement that doesnt rely on very specific scenarios.</p>
