    <strong>They manipulate us into believing the enemy is our neighbor. Excerpt from my journal.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm tired with the world, with existing. The only value humans are given is money. Money this, money that. Little pieces of paper given imaginary value. Controlling us, marginalizing us, dividing us, killing us; turning us into slaves, whores, murderers, dictators. The big businesses and government make us work for imaginary paper, tells us lies about where it goes, then adds it to their stack of trillions. It is robbery. Robbing us of our livelihood, our true value. Then the media takes this money, spends it on advertising to convince us they deserve the very thing they stole from us. They hide under a facade of relating to us. Walmart pretending to give a shit about us or our family. All they want is your money.</p>
<p>The "coronavirus" for example, has made advertising even more unbearable and excruciating. Let's tell the entire population to be ashamed to interact with others, cover your face, stay alone in isolation, don't see your family and friends, you're a killer for not wearing cloth over your face. Then turn on the television. "We're all in this together", "the holidays are a time to come together", "family", "love",etc... Don't speak of love or family when all you want is our money and division. That fat rich guy looking down on us like vermin tooootally cares about you and your family...riiiight. Biggest joke ever. Hypocrisy and contradiction have become the basis of media. </p>
<p>The most mind-numbing, disgusting, sanity-stealing part about this day and age, this whole "pandemic", is how easily it has been to control the human race. We have allowed the government to tell us where we can and can't go, how to behave, where to fucking stand in line, who to trust, who to hate. <strong>We have fallen victim to a multitude of injustices with compliance.</strong> People are actually siding with the oppressors and believing their lies with ignorant, unquestioning faith in the government. They have been dishonest since telling us it would be only 2 weeks. After they broke that promise, there is no excuse to believe a single word that spews from their mouths. Of course, it's easier to tell a population a lie to get them to comply. Real threats don't strike loudly, <em>they sneak in through the back door</em>. When has the government ever had the peoples' best interest at heart?</p>
<p>Many people are fighting for the wrong side in the belief that they made the right choice. Mindless compliance is <strong>never</strong> the right choice. I am ashamed for humanity, and I am ashamed of myself. Ashamed for being compliant to avoid hassles and dirty looks. No more. It disheartens me even more knowing that my generation, the youth, are the ones siding with submission, making fun of people who stand up or question the government. I thought young adults were the rebellious, who questioned authority, who hated people telling them what to do. <strong>Freedom is not a constitutional right, it is a human right</strong>. Don't believe a narrative that strips you of your human nature.</p>
<p>Everyone is so lost in the muck of finger-pointing, blaming, and blind hatred of anyone who has a differing opinion. Race, political-parties, religion, and sex/gender identity are the most common ways that tyrannical governments' control the masses. Anything to get us to turn against our fellow man than to turn against them. They fear us. <strong>They should fear us.</strong> The damage we could do to them if we all stood together would be astronomical. We far out-number them. Their power is fictional. So, <em>they manipulate us into believing the enemy is our neighbor.</em> How's that for easy population control? It's all "you're black I'm white!", "you're left I'm right!", None of it matters! There is no difference. Hatred is hatred. Life is not as simple as black and white. Left and right is the same thing. Only when we stand on our own we can be free. We do not have to pick sides because the sides are a fantasy. Not to sound like a hippie, but peace and love is the road to solution. Has everyone forgot about that? Although, it's much easier to lack empathy when all you see is half a face. People have become mere objects, obstacles. Disease-carrying, wrongly-opinioned, hate-filled obstacles. Humans have lost their humanity. Until we realize <strong>the only real enemies are the ones playing this chess game</strong>, we are doomed.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with most of your points, except ‚Äòleft is right‚Äô. </p>
<p>Because they fundamentally have different principles for governing. Left is more government power, while right is more power to the individual - let the market play out. True capitalism, with no bailouts. Corporations that are meant to die are meant to die. </p>
<p>We‚Äôve gotten here from shitty leadership on both sides, yes. </p>
<p>Do I think the two party system works? No.</p>

        <p>&rt;the enemy is our neighbor</p>
<p>It goes even deeper than that.  They want you to think that <em>you</em> are the enemy of the people.  It's not just that your neighbor is your enemy, it's also that you are your neighbor's enemy, and you must remember that at all times and treat your body as you would a weapon of mass destruction.  YOU must wear your face rag because YOU are a toxic bioweapon spewing disease particles all over the place.  YOU could be killing your neighbor without even knowing it.  If you feel healthy, you're sick.  They're getting people to doubt their ability to read the signals their own body is sending them.  It's straight-up gaslighting, it's literal psychological warfare, it's pure evil,</p>

        <p>So well said! How can we influence people to take back their humanity? How can we get them to see who the real enemy is? How can we get them to understand that the only thing they should be afraid of is losing their freedom? We need a revolution, a complete paradigm shift or society, culture, anything and everything we have ever prized is lost. Wake up to the reality of what's going on!</p>

        <p>Damn man, you should submit that to the NYT or something. People need to hear that, especially the left...I‚Äôve actually been ‚Äúsubmitting‚Äù half way, I wear my mask like a good puppet but I wear it on my chin. No nose, no mouth. I‚Äôve been doing this since August and no one has had the balls to say anything to me.</p>
