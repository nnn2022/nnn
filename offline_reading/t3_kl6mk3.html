    <strong>I Get How the Doomers Feel.</strong>
    <p><p>You know, sometimes I DO understand how the doomers feel. I’ll be sitting, on here or on Twitter, reading news stories and discussions about covid, the vaccine, lockdowns. Sometimes, just sometimes, for a few seconds, my lizard brain kicks in and all rationality flies out my head, and my animal emotions take over. I think to myself, “Would it be <em>that bad</em> to take the ‘harmless vaccine’, and help others and myself with it? Is it such an inconvenience to wear a mask?” </p>
<p>But then I tell myself NO. This is your lizard brain coming through creating these thoughts. And I bring back the logical side of me and all the dissidence I’ve been seeing, reading, and hearing, with evidence. And you know what? It takes a LOT of willpower, time spent researching, and intelligence to override that automatic, animal instinct— the mob mentality, societal conditioning to “love and care for others and help the elderly”. And I turn myself away. Not because I’m heartless, but because I’ve seen the secondary effects of the lockdowns and vaccines come to the forefront, and know those are way, way worse.</p></p>

        <p>How would you ever help anyone else???? The drug companies literally told us it won’t stop you from getting it, and it won’t stop you from spreading it. </p>

        <p>When I had COVID a few weeks ago, I poked around Reddit in subs for people who tested positive. I could feel myself getting pulled in rather quickly. How had I gotten it? Was I bad? Did I give it to someone else without knowing and did I kill them? What if I had to go to the hospital? What if my smell and taste never came back?</p>
<p>It was really easy to spiral. But then I realized that all of those daunting questions had been put there by a heartless media with an agenda. I had been sick plenty of times in my life, and never once had I felt guilty until now. It isn’t a moral failing to get sick. Even if you DO pass something to someone, this is how viruses work. It’s nothing to feel bad about. </p>
<p>I started reading that 90% of people recovered their sense of smell and taste. So it was unlikely I would be in the 10%, although not impossible. But it didn’t deserve to take up so much space in my head. </p>
<p>I was better after a few days. Now, several weeks out, I feel completely normal. Smell and taste are normal. I haven’t changed my stance on anything, and in fact I’m even more skeptical than before. </p>
<p>But it was so easy to slip into the panic, fear, shame and guilt, that I can see how others who are less discerning have fallen for it.</p>

        <p>Yes, you articulated my thoughts brilliantly. I'm glad to see someone else notice how easily it is to be sucked in by the headlines and fear. You are right, all these questions and fears <em>have</em> been put out by heartless media and the rich, that care nothing for the average folk, only their bottom lines as well as depopulation. </p>
<p>I'm glad you're feeling better and haven't let your getting covid detract from your main stance and thoughts for sure. It definitely doesn't deserve all this anxiety, can you believe it's 9 months later and we're still talking about covid? Because the restrictions haven't ended? So exhausting. I do think it's important to take breaks from social media and from this subreddit as well from time to time, I have doing so throughout this and it's helped immensely.</p>

        <p>I can believe it, unfortunately. I permanently deleted my Facebook account. I do no have TV besides streaming services so my access to news is limited. I don’t use Twitter. I only follow 100 people on Instagram. </p>
<p>I realized that many people are not like this. They are plugged into the doom 24/7. I have a few friends who are doomers, although they’re starting to crack. When they talk about the latest scary thing they saw on Twitter or tiktok I internally roll my eyes. If I am somewhere where the news is on, I grimace at how sensationalized it all is. Once you step away, it’s easy to see. But many people are incapable of this because they are addicted to social media and fear porn.</p>
<p>I do think the holiday season is looking to be the breaking point for many people. The “just stay home” line is tired and clearly ineffectual. As the weather warms, I do firmly believe the will to keep doing this will completely evaporate. There will always be the hypochondriacs still crying about this, ￼ but they can stay in their basements for all of eternity.</p>

        <p>Good on you for staying away from social media. I lost my job months back cause of all this crap, so have a bunch of free time and was like “why not open a Twitter”. </p>
<p>I’m glad to hear your friends are starting to crack. That is so, so relieving to hear, as I’d give anything to return to normal life. I aim to never take for granted normality ever again and do everything I can to live as much as possible to the fullest extent, each and every day. </p>
<p>I completely agree with you, everyone being stuck inside gets them trapped in their own heads, fear every which way on repeat. This is one of the problems of media and social media abundance. But when you step outside, everything is fine! There aren’t hundreds of people dead on the streets due to this. I always think, that had the media not spoken about covid, we never would have known it existed (if it even does). </p>
<p>I really hope you’re correct in that with Spring coming up, people will start to break down. I’m pretty sure people won’t outright take back their covid support throughout all this, to save face, but will subtly start to break more and more rules. Yes, the hypochondriacs can for sure stay home endlessly forever for all we care. Let them 
cry forever. We have had enough!</p>

        <p>Yesterday afternoon I started getting a headache. I never get those. By 6pm, my headache was blaring and I felt awful. I went to bed like well, I guess rona finally got me. I woke up feverish a few times. I slept for over 12 hours and woke up completely fine. Huh</p>

        <p>You hit the nail on the head, for a lot of people that truly enjoy this, it’s no different than their previous life. So they take satisfaction in seeing others suffering with them, and feel better because they’re not obligated to attend social functions anymore. “Misery loves company”, as they say.</p>
