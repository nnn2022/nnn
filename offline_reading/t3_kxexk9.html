    <strong>Germany getting crazy</strong>
    <p><p>Germany starts imposing fascist regulations. They discuss to stop all public transportation. Schools, kindergartens, restaurants, all retailers are already closed for more than a month. Another stupidity in Bayern state starting from Monday only FFP2 type of masks are allowed in still open places such as food stores and public transportation. It seems it took them more than a year to decide what mask work indeed. I feel that it is a long term plan which aims to divide people, to widen fear, make everyone suspicious of others and think egotistical. Then they would impose more. Firstly they would widen home office approach, slowly abolish some professions, tell people that anyway they were working from home and their job can be done by some machines, softwares. As a result we would have only up class. No mid class. Others will be doing still physically human power demanding jobs and for these jobs there will be high demand because mid class already will not exist and all those unemployed people will need to feed their family. Of course they have excuses. Too much population and accordingly climate change, blah blah but they would never accept that they are the reason. Somehow we have to resist, let them know that we are aware of that. Definitely they have great control, they have internet, they have Amazon, they do have all data to get us but before it is too late we have to do something.</p></p>

        <p>There's, unfortunately, also a lot of compliance.</p>
<p>It's <em>really</em> tough in Germany, with all the implied societal conformity. Being individualistic is not as respected as is in the US, and being rebelious not seen as passionately as is in France.</p>
<p>However, on the upside, news articles on new policies by tabloid journalism has been approaching a 60/40 angry/like ratio on Facebook, but is still around 40/60 on "serious" journalism. The FFP2 mask mandate in Bavaria wasn't too well received, I've noticed...</p>

        <p>A lot of people that i know from germany are super alternative people.</p>
<p>But i imagine there is also a lot of compliance. Germany is well known for following the rules strictly and profusely anyway. But yes also germany has a large percentage of hippies and alternative people, subcultures i also think.</p>
<p>I think it is the same in many first world countries of the world.</p>
<p>I think that the non-compliant will soon outweigh the compliant ones.</p>
<p>People are starting to get super super tired of all of this.</p>

        <p>It's not wrong that Germany does have a lot of subcultures, but guess what: The people there are just shifting conformancy from greater society to a subculture.</p>
<p>Only very few Germans are "true" individualists, who'll say and do what they believe to be correct. The rest will carefully try to find out if they're conformant, before opening their mouths, and keep it shut otherwise. And this holds true in Germany no matter where, be it in a mainstream political party, or, ironically, even amongst anarchists.</p>
<p>I grew up in Asia as a kid of German expatriate parents, was heavily influenced by Western/US media and the internet, and have now been living in Germany for the past 15 years, so I'm kinda fortunate to be able to see it from an outside perspective as well.</p>

        <p>Where did you see that? I don't use any other social media therefore I am not aware of. There was one planned in our city for coming Sunday and city governing bodies canceled permission.</p>
