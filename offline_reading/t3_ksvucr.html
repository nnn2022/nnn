    <strong>We are all in a madhouse now.</strong>
    <p><p>Being a history buff (especially medicine), a while back I read an interesting book by the American 19th Century journalist, Nellie Bly - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Days_in_a_Mad-House#Research">Ten Days in a Madhouse</a>.</p>
<p>It made me think of what has been going on around us for the last 11 months.</p>
<p>As an investigative journalist, she feigned madness and got herself committed to the asylum on Blackwell's Island, where she observed the barbaric conditions, abusive staff, rotten food, and complete lack of empathy or treatment of the people trapped there. When she (after great difficulty) got herself released and wrote her book, it caused a scandal.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the ScamDemic, you ask? Simple. Our society is now operating in the same dysfunctional way as the madhouse she describes:</p>
<p>-  When she arrived at the madhouse, she immediately returned to acting "sane". Her "doctors" immediately twisted this into more "proof" that she was crazy. The harder she tried, the more they doubled down on their diagnosis. <em>It's the same inversion of reality we see all around us now, as our health officials, politicians, and media double down on their insanity, and project it onto those of us who see The Rona for the sham it is.</em></p>
<p>- She quickly determined that at least a third of the inmates were perfectly sane, and had no business being locked up. It was "the inmates who were running the asylum"! <em>Instead of a building, think in terms of a society.</em> <em>Sound familiar these days? Do our masters strike you as rational and stable? Do those questioning the narratives strike you as crazy?</em></p>
<p>- She also determined that the routine, conditions, and treatment in the madhouse were actually what drove the inmates insane - seemingly by design. Their inability to process and understand the reality or purpose of what was being done to them versus what their own senses told them, drove them over the edge. <em>In the same way, instead of chains, electric shocks, ice baths, and straitjackets, our keepers are using lockdowns, masks, and gaslighting to create a society of neurotics.</em> </p>
<p>Our present society's demands that people accept an inverted, false reality inflicted upon us by our elites - society as a giant asylum, against the evidence of their own senses, is literally driving men mad. </p>
<p>But those of us who won't go along with it are the ones they call "mad".</p></p>

        <p>Nice research man!  That is super interesting.  I had never heard of Nellie Bly.  </p>
<p>Great observations about society gaslighting.  </p>

<p>Have you ever read the book <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest?</em> It goes into those same themes in psychiatric hospitals. There‚Äôs a movie version of it as well. I‚Äôm seeing the same type of rationale for it being used in the world right now, too. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for your own good.‚Äù</p>
<p>(Btw, nice username. I think she does need a plastic surgeon. üòÜ)</p>

        <p>Sounds like a fascinating read. I'll be checking it out.
And yes, it does sound like there are some stark parallels. Brings to mind the Trial by Kafka too.</p>

        <p>Maybe different because our leaders are in fact acting rationally, they are just trying to achieve goals that have nothing to do with stopping the spread of the virus or preventing a public health crisis.  When we look at their actions via this prism, it seems insane, because there is no logic to it, but looked at via the goals they are actually trying to achieve, they do make sense.</p>
