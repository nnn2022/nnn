    <strong>If I had my medical emergency during COVID, I think I would have died.</strong>
    <p><p>About a year ago I had a miscarriage and developed sepsis. I never knew I was pregnant until I was hospitalized. I don’t remember much from the night I went in. I had a super high fever and I was throwing up. My husband took me to the hospital and I was immediately taken care of. I had gone into septic shock. That kills about half the people who get it. My second day in the hospital they told my husband I probably wasn’t going to make it and he should make arrangements while I was still around. I’ll never forget him bringing me flowers and holding me for hours on end. They never told me, but that’s when I figured my time was up. I’ve fully recovered now, luckily I have no long term damage to any of my organs.</p>
<p>At that time I lived in a really liberal state with heavy lockdowns. I’m afraid that if that happened during a hard lockdown, I would have died. The hospitals in my state (which doesn’t have many restrictions) have some stupid policies. I can’t imagine what it’s like back where I used to live. I heard of whole hospitals being reserved for COVID and drugs and treatments only being for COVID patients. Not to mention the other BS that comes with emergency rooms.</p>
<p>I know that they would have treated me anyway because I was literally dying, but waiting a few extra minutes can be deadly. In the condition I was in, an extra few minutes without treatment would have killed me. This idea really scares me. I might be pregnant so I’ve been thinking about the whole experience and I’m terrified. I’m terrified of something like that happening and not being able to get care fast enough. I wonder about the other people who have died because of this.</p></p>

        <p>I’m so glad you made it through that and your husband didn’t lose his wife. If you are pregnant again, that is so wonderful! I hope it is a healthy pregnancy.</p>
<p>During the lockdown a friend took her son to the ER due to stomach pains. They refused to treat him until he had a covid test. While they were waiting for the results, his appendix burst. He almost died because they had to make sure he didn’t have a flu like illness. So you are absolutely right. You wouldn’t be here if this had happened during the lockdown. I have no doubt they wouldn’t have treated you without making sure you didn’t have covid first.</p>

        <p>That is absolutely fucking ridiculous. If he had tested positive for Covid, wouldn't they have still treated him anyway? So what does it fucking matter? And if they would NOT have treated him if he'd tested positive, then that's even more fucked up.</p>

        <p>I know! It’s all ridiculous. My only guess is if he had covid they would have put him on the covid floor? I don’t know. Man that hospital would have been sued for everything they have if he had died.</p>

        <p>I didn’t even know I was miscarrying until a few days after I first got into the hospital. I had bad cramping and pain but I never bled, to explain it crudely that’s how I got the infection. When I went to the ER I collapsed on the floor so I think they still would have helped me fast but yeah probably not fast enough.</p>

        <p>I cannot blame you for being scared.</p>
<p>This is the thing that I am worried about as well: Should someone get truly lethally sick? Because of the stupidity of the CoVid-19 lockdowns, they might wait too long to call for help and be beyond help when they get to the hospital.</p>

        <p>I’m so glad you’re okay! This is exactly my fear. My tokophobia has gone through the roof to the point where I’m terrified of sex even with two birth control methods. I don’t want kids ever and I can’t wear any tight face coverings because of PTSD so I guess I’d just have to die untreated if something like that happened. Yet I’ve had COVID and it wasn’t even that bad.</p>

        <p>During the spring peak the hospital where I work and many others had to put off non urgent care. I worked in neurosurgery and all neurosurgical patients require an ICU stay, even when the surgery isn't an emergency, so we had to cancel many procedures that were not treating immediately life threatening diseases. I really hope that we are able to maintain low numbers of patients requiring hospitalization due to COVID using the appropriate public health measures so that I never have to see that again.</p>
