    <strong>Now everyone wants to feel sorry for small businesses being screwed by the lockdown but when we pointed out that in March/April we were grandma killers.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m noticing the MSM shift of posting these sad stories of Businesses going under which are full of the virtue signal of the month mentality types. </p>
<p>Now all a sudden they care about Small Business being fucked over after advocating for longterm indefinite lockdowns. But it’s not only that they were wrong. It could be understandable if they were misled I know many of us anti lockdown/new normalers converted from full doomer. </p>
<p>But what pisses me off is how they demonized, shamed, and ostracized anyone who dared to express their personal economic concerns. They expected us to just be fine with our livelihoods being destroyed for their security. You couldn’t even say you were worried about losing your job or paying bills without being labeled as selfish. They went and misconstrued lockdown protests as being about haircuts and ignored the cries of those same owners. Why? Because it wasn’t the virtue signal of the month</p></p>

        <p>That's a stupid opinion, and I'd like to use American Beer to prove it.</p>
<p>Before prohibition the USA actually had a great beer scene with over 1000 American breweries creating all styles and even mixing and matching regional ideas as America does so well.</p>
<p>Obviously most brewing companies shut down during prohibition but a small handful pivoted to other legal activities and were able to survive. Of note - Coors pivoted to ceramics for scientific use, malted milk, and refrigerated shipping (and to this day won't shut up about the temperature of their beer). Anheuser Busch did a similar pivot minus the ceramics but also sold ice cream (which cracks me up) </p>
<p>Anyways when prohibition ended the 1000 breweries didn't magically reopen. A small number of companies that already had cashflow and know how came to quickly dominate the market. And while the past decade or two we're finally seeing the return of the American micro Brewery, the dark ages of American beer caused by prohibition lasted over half a century. </p>
<p>So yeah, new restaurants might open. But don't be shocked when those mom and pop places turn into applebees and outbacks.</p>

<p>I share this one a lot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP98ZKt709A "The Six Purposes of Schooling" - John Taylor Gatto (1917 Alexander James Ingles) The 5th purpose should ring a bell with the "incel" issue.</p>
<p>"Schools are meant to tag the "unfit" with their inferiority, by poor grades, remedial placement, humiliation; so that their <strong>peers</strong> will accept them as "inferior"."</p>

        <p>This is a really good point. Of course the economy <em>will</em> recover. Whether or not it happens in your lifetime, however... well, that's something people don't grasp. </p>
<p>The issue is that, in small town America, most of the businesses that go under won't actually be replaced immediately. Your local [insert business here] is going to fold. Then the lot is going to be empty, because no one can afford it or no one wants to take the financial risk of establishing their business there. After several years of the lot being empty, it might be bought out by a chain, and you might get to have an Applebee's years after John's Deli kicked the bucket. It's a lose-lose situation.</p>

        <p>By the way, this entire situation is much more nefarious than you'd imagine. Ethanol was becoming a cheap biofuel at the start of the 20th century. Not only did prohibition consolidate power over the "getting drunk for fun" industry, ethanol now isn't a reasonable alternative fuel source because the monopolies drove up the price so much.</p>

        <p>No one in my personal life that was pro-lockdown cares about small business or pretends to now. They got take out three times and then said "Yay us! We saved restaurants!" Even though that meant advocating against my family's income. Against me personally. Even when I explained in painful detail why take-out can't shore up a restaurant. Why capacity restraint is a slow death instead of a fast one, especially when there's no plan to restore things. And this is just my experience in this one area. They are very happy to stay in Costco where it's REALLY SAFE and have a contactless corporate pizza in a hazmat suit wash itself in the driveway from now on. You can't trust a small business. They are owned by people, and people are dangerous. They might make a decision they don't agree with. Can't have that!</p>
<p>If the MSM is shifting now, it's so far past being too late it's going to lap itself.</p>

        <p>It’s the technocracy. Look at young 30s and under. They do not care about small business. They only care about what food has an app and they can have delivered. Quality is not important as long as it cost them what they consider means quality. If there’s a promo code on YouTube they are using that. They LIKE corporations because they don’t have to do any thinking. They can return to jerking off quicker if they don’t</p>

        <p>They often say they feel bad for the small businesses but will never blame the lockdowns, they’ll blame the government for not doing more to support them, As if it is viable for the government to provide every business affected in the country by Lockdown restrictions with indefinite financial support until they deem it “safe” to reopen eventually... someday... maybe after a vaccine.</p>

        <p>You know what else is funny?  Everyone on reddit gushing about essential business workers and how awesome they are until the riots started.</p>
<p>When you pointed out how the essential businesses workers are probably going to get assfucked by the riots, you'd be flooded with downvotes, called a racist, and told that "rioting is the language of the unheard!" and "things can be replaced, human lives can't!"</p>
<p>Here's another funny thing.  Everyone was saying "Stay home for the sake of the healthcare workers!"  Which immediately shifted to "Go out and protest now, or else you're a racist!"</p>
<p>Idk why everyone's scared of covid/trying to come up with vaccines to kill it  These germs all seem like cool people who'll just take the day off if you're at a BLM protest because it's for a good cause.</p>

        <p>Social media has created such a massive platform for hive mind, public shaming, virtue signaling, bullying. If you don't fit the mainstream, you're bad and you deserve to be shamed. There's no room for alternative opinions or polite discussion when people treat others this way.</p>

<p>That said, I think you’re barking at the wrong tree. The problem lies in the fact that massive corporations have gotten billions upon billions in bailout, but assistance for small businesses have been abysmal. Maybe channel your energy into that.</p>
