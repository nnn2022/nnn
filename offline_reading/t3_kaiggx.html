    <strong>When did vaccines become a bonafide cure?</strong>
    <p><p>What happened to just eating healthy and being active taking your vitamins and so forth. </p>
<p>Could have sworn this was almost always far more effective than any manufactured drug.</p>
<p>Imagine telling someone last year December about everything that transpired this year, just to save the 0.03%.</p>
<p>Yet here we are and when you ask to provide concrete proof you get the usual MSM  bull or so and so saw it on XYZ social media platform. </p>
<p>If you still don't accept to blind follow then you are the problem and are labeled with whatever arbitrary title fits the timeline, whether it be a communist, an illegal immigrant stealing our jobs, or an extremist trying to destroy our 'freedom', backwards etc..</p></p>

        <p>You want people to eat healthy and be active? That sounds like a lot of effort. It is easier to eat whatever you want and sit on the couch.</p>
<p>We do know that obesity is a big risk factor when it comes to COVID, and instead of addressing that, we're exacerbating the problem. People are gaining a few pounds a month, and most didn't have any room to gain in the first place.</p>

        <p>If everyone started eating healthier and exercising daily back in March, they could have been 50+ lbs lighter by now. Instead they used COVID as an excuse to be lazy and gluttonous and are at a bigger risk than they were in the first place.</p>

        <p>&rt;When did vaccines become a bonafide cure?</p>
<p>Vaccines have been th√© preventive strategy for conditions like tetanus &amp; polio for decades.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Bill Gates started to invest a fortune into the vaccine business, though, that vaccines slowly but steadily became this holy miracle cure for mostly harmless viruses that everyone must take to keep their civil rights even though they don't really seem to cure or prevent anything most of the time.</p>
