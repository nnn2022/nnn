        <p>We just had the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the ultra wealthy during this "pandemic"</p>
<p>This is just one example of many of how that sausage gets made.</p>

        <p>Because money after the financial collapse back in 2007-2008 there were a ton of foreclosed homes and mortgages were harder to get after and the government started allowing investors to buy foreclosed homes in mass and then rent them or resell them when market conditions improved and make a profit.  It's BS but it's not suspicious or a new practice.</p>

        <p>Is this real? Canada’s housing market is fucked and I have to wonder how so many people can apparently afford almost $1 million dollar homes when the average salary is $55K a year or somewhere around there.</p>

        <p>There is nothing new about this practice. Wealth management funds buy any assets that promise appreciation. As long as it appreciates it’s all good. Whether it is a house or pork bellies does not matter, the only thing that matters is rate of return. I am old enough to remember how in 2006 everyone around me were flipping houses completely confident that the prices will keep rising forever. Then crash came. And I bought beachfront condo in FL for the price of a used midrange BMW, 75% off the price the condo sold only a year ago. I am not a wealth management fund. Ultimately, the value of a house is limited by how much people who buy it can afford. If wealth management fund owns a million houses but there are no million people who can buy it at the price they ask it’s a loss, not profit. The person who thinks that they are buying up all the properties to rent them out has no idea what kind of major headache it is to be a landlord. It is far from glorious because you very often deal with people who don’t pay, either because they are unable or because they are unwilling.</p>
