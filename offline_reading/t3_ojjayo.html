    <strong>I grew up in an abusive household, so I'm not surprised by any of this {TW: abuse}</strong>
    <p><p>The other day, my fianc√© made a remark that I had a keen ability to predict how this whole coronavirus situation would unfold--I had correctly foreseen a year ago that as soon as vaccines were distributed, the goal posts would shift again, and that nothing would ever be good enough to justify going back to normal. I knew with certainty that those in power would never let us go back to freedom easily. They'd continue to demonize, humiliate and restrict us.</p>
<p>Do I possess some kind of clairvoyance? Hardly. But I did grow up in a physically and emotionally abusive household which I left at 17. It took me years to reconcile the abuse I experienced since it was so normal. But now, and probably like many others who have lived through similar, I can see it from a mile away.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for sympathy. I've dealt extensively with these experiences in therapy and my mother has been dead for nearly a decade, but never did she once apologize for her cruel mistreatment of me and my sister. The closest she got was asking me on her deathbed if she'd done a good job. I lied and said yes, she had. It's difficult to to seek retribution when your once terrifying mother is reduced to a heap of skin and bones, wasting away from the cancer that consumed her.</p>
<p>When she was in her prime, however, I lived in perpetual fear of when she'd snap. Her rage resembled that of the fictional cartoon character, the Tasmanian Devil--all of a sudden, and without warning, she'd become angered. Her face flushed red. Her eyes, usually blue and wide, narrowed into black slits. She'd scream until frothy spit accumulated at the corners of her mouth and her voice reached an otherworldly octave that is likely responsible for my lifelong tinnitus. The earliest memory I have is at 4 years old, with her coming towards me, about to punish me for something. I was walking backwards down the hall with nowhere to escape; the floorboards creaked under my small feet. Her unbroken gaze bore into me like a lion about to devour its prey. The beatings themselves have long since been blocked from my memory--I seem to remember them as if I were floating from above, watching them take place. I do remember me screaming and pleading for her to stop. I remember the heel of the black clog sinking into my flesh. I'd instinctively try and block her blows with my hands and she'd shriek for me to move them out of the way. She'd grab my hair and throw me around my room, usually ending the sordid affair by locking me in my closet. Eventually I'd fall into a tenuous sleep, always nervous she would burst through the door and start again. My bedroom was on the second floor and I would lay awake devising plans to jump out of the window if she ever tried to kill me, which I was convinced she would. At one point, I snuck a kitchen knife into my room and hid it my drawer to defend myself against her, although I never used it. The soft, thin sheet of my bed stung against the fresh bruises. I'd wake up the next day, forget for a second, and then the heavy, sick feeling would return in my stomach as I remembered the day before. The morning after was always quiet, yet tense. My mother would ignore me for days, telling me to get out of her sight.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for you, I would have gone to college and made something of myself," my mother snarled in my face. "But now I'm stuck here, having to take care of you." Sentiments like this were common for my mother, who was a deeply emotionally disturbed, mentally ill woman. A few of her favorite morsels of motherly love she enjoyed sharing with me, her daughter, included telling me how I was born miserable, and that there was nothing I could do to change it; I was just naturally a repulsive person who cleared a room as soon as I entered it. She'd call me an ungrateful bitch and insist that no man would ever want me; I'd end up alone, drug addicted underneath a bridge. And if I did somehow manage to convince a man to be with me, she felt sorry for whoever that was.</p>
<p>What brought on these beatings? Once, when I was 8, we did an arts and crafts project in Girl Scouts where we painted sweatshirts with fabric paint. When my sweatshirt was hung up to dry, the paint ran down the front of it, ruining my design. This was cause for a severe beating, because somehow this was my fault. Another time I touched--literally, just touched with my index finger--an end table in the living room, and this was enough to awaken her rage. <em>"I told you not to touch my furniture!"</em> That one lasted for hours. Eventually she forced me into the bath while she retreated to her room and cried loudly about why she was stuck with a daughter like me.</p>
<p>Around this time, she sat me down and apologized for hitting me. She said she'd never do it again. I believed her. However, that promise was soon broken. It was a cycle. One that I could never escape from. I imagine she felt guilty at some point, because after each harsh beating and mandatory 3 day silent treatment, she'd offer to take me shopping. I would always refuse, not wanting to be in her presence any longer than necessary. But she would insist, so off to the mall we'd go. But it was only a matter of time before she became impatient and frustrated with the whole experience, telling me to hurry up. I'd feel my pulse quicken, knowing that any wrong move on my part would ignite her temper. Being in public was no deterrent either--humiliation seemed to be some sort of pasttime for her. She once pushed me down on an icy sidewalk in front of a friend's house because she was angry I was there. She refused to take me to school in high school, and when a friend called our landline to get my address (pre cellphones) she screamed into the phone that I wasn't her friend and she better not dare come here to pick me up. She forced me to wear out of style uncomfortable clothing and threatened to break my neck if I didn't. Her way of motivating me to do chores was to tell me she'd knock my teeth out. If I tried to cook, clean, or otherwise assert any independence at all, I was doing it all wrong. I was stupid and should know by now how to take care of myself even though she never bothered to calmly show me how to do basic chores. I was so scared to ask for help that I avoided chores, which of course, made me lazy, disgusting and ungrateful in her eyes. Every hobby I had, she sabotaged. Swim team? She got mad at me for something and then refused to take me to my swim meet. The coach confronted me the next day because I hadn't shown. I was 12 and had no idea what to say. Drawing? In a rage, she once ripped all my sketches off the wall, tore them up, and left them in a bag for me to find when I got home. Guitar? She'd threaten to cancel my lessons any chance she could. Soccer? She refused to sign me up for the team, then said I was the one who didn't want to join because of school, which wasn't true at all.</p>
<p>At 15, during one of her tirades, she ended up kicking me out of the house and telling me not to come back. I walked two miles to the police station and filed a report, thinking this would be a catalyst for change. I was growing tired of her abuse and as a teen could see that the problem was her, not me. Nothing was ever good enough; she always found fault in whatever I did or didn't do. Got a 1250 on my SATs? She said I could do better, and slapped my face. If I wanted to go out and have a social life? She called me a whore. So, I naively thought involving authorities would somehow help.</p>
<p>My dad picked me up from the police station and brought me home. It should be mentioned here that my father never once stood up for me or protected me, even though he was often home during the abuse. He was, and is, a passive shell of a man. The only time he stood up to her was when she wanted to take my house key away in high school, so that I would either never be able to leave the house or have to wait outside to be let in if I did. That was the only time he said he wouldn't allow it.</p>
<p>When my dad and I got home, my mom was standing at the top of the stairs with a butcher knife clutched firmly at her side. She had been waiting. Her eyes were dead and cold, like she wasn't really there. She seemed to stare through me. In a haunting whisper, she said, "Why did you go to the police?"</p>
<p>I froze. She took one step down, then asked again why I went. <em>Here it was,</em> I thought. <em>She was finally going to kill me, just like she had wanted to all along. And it was going to hurt.</em> I turned and ran. Out the back door, across the yard, and to the neighbor's where I pounded on the door, crying frantically. They ended up calling the police. DSS was involved.</p>
<p>Freedom came at 17. I went to college 12 hours away, purposefully far enough to be outside of her reach. Our relationship did improve after that; she got treatment for her mental health and calmed down some, although she still had her moments. But as I became an adult I think she knew her grasp on me was gone. She also had cancer, which weakened her. She died when I was 24.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I sharing this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because the situation we're in now is the exact same. It is abuse. An abusive person will</strong> <strong><em>never, ever</em></strong> <strong>stop being abusive. You cannot plead with them. You cannot rationalize with them. They will tell you they're sorry and then they'll do it again. It will be your fault. IT WILL ALWAYS BE YOUR FAULT. You're the reason they're angry, the reason they're miserable, the reason their life hasn't turned out like they hoped. You will never be good enough. There are no rules. You think you're following the rules, but they'll change on a whim to justify the abuser's actions. They want you to be scared and alone so they can control you. If you begin to claim some independence or have the nerve to feel confident about yourself, they'll immediately tear you down. They are actually terrified that you'll leave them and thrive without them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We are living under the rule of people who are disguising their abuse as beneficial for us. They are sabotaging everything that makes us human--friendships, family, relationships, hobbies, leisure, travel--and then blaming us for it. Saying that if we only did what we were told, we could have those things back. The mask is a ritual in humiliation and discomfort. The covid "precautions" are dehumanizing, nonsensical farces meant to confuse and belittle us. The headlines about surges and returning mandates are just like my mom yelling at me to clean or she'll break my neck--a threat to get me to do what she wants. Now they're onto vaccines, guilting and shaming us for not wanting it. Again, it will be OUR fault. They want you afraid, hanging onto their every word. They want unrestricted control over your life. They want to demonize you for having immutable human desires.</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOU CANNOT ASK AN ABUSER NOT TO ABUSE. YOU HAVE TO REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE EQUATION</strong> <a href="https://ENTIRELY.Do"><strong>ENTIRELY.</strong></a> <strong>Do not participate. Do not give an inch. This is abuse. You aren't crazy and you aren't alone. Most people who haven't lived through abuse don't know any better.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p></p>

        <p>also any sort of disagreement was NOT TOLERATED at all. Even questioning something would be met with harsh punishment. Reminds me of the New Normal. Expect reprisals all out of proportion for not complying with absurd ever changing rules.</p>

        <p>I really feel you on this one. I lived 18 years of my life being denied the ability to breathe and just be as my own person because my dad bullied and threatened me and anyone else who disagreed even slightly with him. I never spoke against him, I gave up and altered my entire identity just to accomodate for both his and mom's behavior but to also not face any consequences of such. You give yourself up in that situation in order to survive that toxic hellhole. It actually dawned at me at that age that not everyone is actually in constant pain, not everyone actually lives in that way, always anticipating what's going to happen next, always trying to prevent any bigger problems from coming up lest you get the brunt of it. Never again. Once bitten, twice shy.</p>
<p>Right now, the one place/outlet we have outside of home is also being fucked up in so many fucking ways...being divided among friends, co-workers, there's been the other social/political occurrences in the past that might have divided people but NEVER has it been on this intimate of a scale. </p>
<p>Enough is fucking enough and we NEED to make that loud and clear so they don't walk all over us more than they already have been.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are. They had parents who were normal and looked out for them, they've experienced few hardships, and they genuinely believe that the authorities making these decisions are doing it for the common good. They cannot accept that people can and do abuse power.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly....this was my life growing up too. Sadly I didn't go no contact until my 40s, and was NC for a time when I was young, and low contact. I had beatings and being locked in rooms and other really bad stuff and ALL THIS COVID SHIT EXACTLY MATCHES.</p>

        <p>And the cure should be the same! Go no contact. Don't give the powers that be an inch. Rest assured they will never stop because there's plenty of people volunteering to be abused and act as their little flying monkeys. But that shouldn't stop us from enjoying and making most of the precious and only life we have. Build alliances, grow things, trade and prosper in any way you can. As always, success will be the best revenge.</p>

        <p>Thank you. My life is pretty great now. I forgave both of my parents. My mom was horribly abused as a child and repeated what she knew. Mental health was stigmatized and I believe she did the best she could. </p>
<p>I don't know that I will ever forgive the politicians and doomers who insist on permanent lockdown, however. At the end of her life, my mom displayed remorse and regret. Even though she never outright apologized she told her friend that she regretted a lot of what she did and said.</p>
<p>I could forgive just about anyone if they were truly sorry. But these sick people enjoy this game.</p>

        <p>That is so amazing what a special person you are! I grew up with an alcoholic mom, my parents were the sweetest kindest people but my dad suddenly passed away from a heart attack when I was five. My mom was a nurse and she worked so hard to take care of us on her own it was just the two of us. She had so many losses in her Young Life I see why she turned to alcohol to self-medicate as an adult now. Her drinking affected me profoundly however she was a very sweet kind loving person. Her struggles were so hard to watch but I learned a lot from her. I ended up at the same place as you though. I realized my mother had had a very hard life, I looked at her as a human being not as my mother and I could see that she did the best she could. No bitterness or anger here for me either. Many people can't get to where we are, it's a blessing to be able to see this! I agree with you about the government too. These people are absolute Psychopaths. I honestly think they have some sort of criminal mental disorders. No Remorse. Like a bunch of serial killers. The way they compartmentalize is absolutely chilling. I seriously hope they pay for what they've done. I'm not too hopeful about that though.</p>

        <p>This is spot on! I was listening to a podcast the other day and someone mentioned how people who had been in abusive relationships and worked towards their inner healing were able to recognize this scam. 
I was in a similar situation with my mom and it‚Äôs interesting because I woke up before my partner and thankfully I helped him wake up too. I think it‚Äôs because I have a bullshit detector for narcissists and psychopaths. I feel like I‚Äôve fought them my entire life ( family, friends, bosses, etc).</p>

        <p>I was bullied by a guy in high school. He acted all cool with me in the beginning and one day turned on me. I ended up fighting him and he straight up kicked my ass. Funny thing is later I found out he bullied all of his friends individually in private and if you stood up for yourself he would do it in front of an audience. </p>
<p>It wasn't until I stood up to him that one by one the others stood up for themselves as well a little later down the road. They just needed to see that it was possible. I now know why they were so kind to me the next day after the fight. I saw my wife's friends, people who were all about helping the down trodden, the little guy, suddenly turn into bullies doing the exact same thing my bully did. </p>
<p>I knew masks were going to be the symbol that would turn the public against each other and I wanted no part of it. I made sure not to teach my son the phrase "sheep" in reference to the mask wearers. He's 4 now. He asked once, "Why do people wear mask and we don't?" </p>
<p>I told him that they're scared and that fear causes people to do silly and strange things but that we should be patient with them because they're people just like us. I told him there are situations were it's ok to wear masks like at parties or Halloween or when the air is filled with dangerous chemicals. He got the gist. I did not want to teach him the behavior of my wife's friends as well as some of mine displayed toward us. He's also seen me handle confrontation regarding masks and I did it without yelling or calling people names or being disrespectful or a fist fight though I have no problem defending myself when necessary. </p>
<p>Terribly sorry for what you went through OP but I'm so glad you're done with it and that you were able to take valuable knowledge from it. Good luck out there, my family is with you in spirit. Love and light.</p>

        <p>Every word you wrote resonates.  I would only add:</p>
<p>I don't think ALL the rabid, pro-lockdown, pro-mask, pro-covidvaccine people haven't been abused.  I think a lot of them also grew up in an abusive family, but are too scared to stand up for themselves, too scared to rock the boat, too scared to not go along with the abuse.  They know what happens when you disobey the abuser, and they are just not going to do that.  And they'll turn  anyone else in, without a second thought, so as not to bring it down on themselves.  If you are in an abusive family, you know who I mean.  And like the abuser, they will never change.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm so sorry you had to experience that as a child. I too had an abusive childhood and I think because of that we are able to look at these situations and question them. We have learned that the people who are supposed to love us and take care of us don‚Äôt always have our best interests at heart. As horrific as it is, it has given us the gift of not blindly trusting. So many people are blind to reality right now, we just need to keep connecting with like minded people and try and ride it out. Things will be very intense the next six months for the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Hmm, similar story with my abusive yet very religious father and ALS. But you certainly notice the cracks when you  are marginalized or forgotten. Further being a single Dad in a system that does not even see us as a parent but a pay check and it is up to the mothers charity so children suffer, you really begin to see the system is not only not perfect but self regulating. I am also far from the most marginalized which i saw when i grew up in Africa, you realize it is all a show.</p>

        <p>Wow, I‚Äôm speechless. This is one of the most enlightening posts I‚Äôve ever read and I‚Äôve never related to someone‚Äôs words like this before. You worded this better than I ever could.</p>
<p>Reading and relating to your experiences has me tearing up. My past rarely escalated to violence, but that was because my abuser was playing a long game with me so he could get away with whatever he pleased, as long as the scarring was all mental. </p>
<p>There are more people than we realize who are unspeakably evil, from all walks of life. Those of us unfortunate enough to have had psychopaths controlling our lives, really are the first ones to truly get it.</p>
<p>I went through an all too familiar cycle in March 2020. Trying to do the right thing for my own preservation, trying to get by. Then as the next few months passed, logic was a fantasy construct, mass hypnosis was starting to enthrall us and suddenly in June 2020 it all clicked. I was going through the motions the exact same as I used to with the abuser I escaped from. </p>
<p>Trusting our instinct is the very first thing abusers pummel outta us. I‚Äôll stand by this until the day I die, the power of your own instinct will save you more than blind trust while afraid ever will. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs indescribably sickening watching more and more people around me grow demoralized. They can‚Äôt see why and I can‚Äôt do anything to help them.</p>
<p>I continue to endure these restrictions like everyone else here, but to a certainly more specific extent, I feel my heart crack a little bit extra each day feeling like I‚Äôm gonna go down with the ship. I never thought I‚Äôd be back here again, when I was just starting to feel safe.</p>
<p>The words of a stranger likely won‚Äôt provide you with any form of consolation or solace, but as someone still relatively young who‚Äôs very much on their own road to recovery, you‚Äôre a bright shining star of a survivor in a decaying hellscape. The fact you‚Äôve been able to recover of your own volition, and still have not lost sight of yourself, proves your mother wrong everyday by embracing the life you‚Äôve been destined to lead.</p>
<p>I wish you all the future happiness and peace in the world, with whatever time is left for us all. I just want you to know that your words deeply affected me.</p>

        <p>Wow, this brought up so many of my own memories (see username). </p>
<p>I consider myself beyond lucky to have spent my high school years in a group foster home, where I went from a withdrawn weirdo to a fairly normal person. My poor sister stayed home with the lunatic and later confessed she felt she must be beyond saving. </p>
<p>Maybe that's why I spot the lunacy, too? Not sure. Dr Peter McCullough described his fellow doctors as seeming to be under a spell. Who knows when it will be broken.</p>
