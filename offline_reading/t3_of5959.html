        <p>I find it hard to wrap around my head the situation we are currently in(well not really). People(not all) have really forgot how to think for themselves. Their argument proceeds from hypothetical ifs to their desired conclusion. Like if their was no lockdown, more people would have died. Like how do you know something that never happened. The usual response is linking some heavyweight publication, with data, charts and credentials flying at your face. Then it is followed by a condescending remark how dumb you are to shut you down(Everybody wants the moral high ground in the loose sense.). Well slugging it all out on table is all well and good, as science proceeds from there. But somewhere along the line, the definition of disagreement has narrowed down. Well its okay to disagree if both you and i reach the same conclusion, but you deviate from the agreed upon conclusion, you are shut down. You see cases like the red states vs blue states in america, or sweden vs uk, but no scientists, experts come forward the deviance from the NORM. That's when you realize its not SCIENCE anymore. The survival rate is more than 99.9%, and early treatment can reduce hospitalization/death by 85%. The effective treatments like ivermectin and hydrochloroquinine, are declared ineffective based on flimsy data. But there are effective treatment protocols centered around these that are being used to treat people. And the results have been very encouraging. But people advocating these and other alternatives are being censored and their character assassinated. There are angry mobs of people attacking these scientists on big tech. Well, one can't argue with facts anymore, as everybody has facts to back them up. But these people who are labelling us anti- science or anti-vaxx are not really concerned about science. There is human need for being part of something bigger. These transcendence was provided by religion for sometime. But as society has progressed and the balance has shifted from individualism to collectivism, this transcendence has lost its metaphysical significance, and has instead degraded to become an animal desire to part of the bigger group in a space with no personal growth of one's own. You see the posture of the people in the media, the government, the language they use. Its not we are combating a virus by scientific means, but a mythical good vs evil battle, where the virus doesn't appear on either side of equation and  where the statists are jumping in to play the hero on the path to victory. Hope we all stay healthy and strong and this comes to pass.</p>

        <p>Heads up OP, this is a very, very silly argument.</p>
<p>I'll be up-front and say that I disagree completely with you politically and was just trolling through the subreddit, but I do risk analysis and figured I'd take a minute to educate, because there's some basic logic here that you're missing:</p>
<p>Even though the vaccine does not fully prevent sickness and transmission, it's supposed to decrease the rate of sickness and transmission. When you're doing public policy, everything's a game of decreasing risks, because usually eliminating them is impossible. Installing traffic lights doesn't completely prevent collisions, but it lowers the risk of them happening.</p>
<p>If there was a collision at a traffic light, would you start asking if they were just a front for people to embezzle money?</p>
<p>I don't think that's the first thing anyone would jump to. I'd start to ask questions about how well-designed the light was, and why there are still people crashing at the intersection.</p>
<p>The idea with vaccine passports is to decrease the risk of transmission by making sure that the people who do high-risk activities are as low-risk for disease transmission as possible. A "better" way to do the same thing would be to go full-on China and actively screen every single person you possibly can, then track them individually.</p>
<p>It's fair to disagree with how necessary stuff like this is. That's the sort of thing you can have a conversation about.</p>
<p>But... what you're trying to disagree with is the basic idea of risk management. To people who understand how that works, you might as well have added 12 and 15 and gotten 45.</p>

        <p>Clever quips are fun, but look at the point I'm making:</p>
<p>This isn't an attempt to change your mind, I'm trying to help you make better arguments so more people take you seriously.</p>
<p>The logic here doesn't work. It's close to working, but if you don't address what masks are supposed to do then anyone who doesn't already agree with you can just outright ignore everything you're saying.</p>
<p>Because you're not talking about how masks are supposed to work, you're talking about how you want them to work.</p>
