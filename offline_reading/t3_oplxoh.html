    <p><p>Where is this data coming from?</p>
<p>Sounds like media propaganda. Isn't the opposite true in the UK?</p></p>

        <p>They're probably pulling the statistics from January 2020 until today.  Which, in that case would be factually correct. </p>
<p>The denominator is so large (because we had a whole year of no-vaccine deaths), any uptick in fully-vaccinated deaths in the last 6 months/year is still a drop in the bucket.</p>

        <p>“During June, every person who died of COVID-19 in Maryland was unvaccinated, according to a spokesperson for the governor's office. There were 130 people who died of COVID-19 in Maryland in June, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”</p>
<p>“In Louisiana, 97% of the state's COVID-19 cases and deaths since February have been in unvaccinated people, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday. Between February and July, unvaccinated people in Louisiana were 20 times more likely to become infected with COVID-19, according to the state health department.”</p>
<p>“In Alabama, over 96% of COVID-19 deaths since April 1 were in unvaccinated people, the state health department said on July 13, for 509 deaths out of 529 total. Over 42% of adults in the state are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.”</p>
<p>“In Los Angeles County, nearly every COVID-19 case, hospitalization and death is in unvaccinated people, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported on July 12. Of the 1,059 new cases reported that day, nearly 87% were in people under the age of 50.”</p>
<p>“New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi said the vaccines are "astonishingly effective" while sharing that over 98% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in the city between Jan. 1 and June 15 were in people who were not fully vaccinated. That included 8,069 deaths in people who were not fully vaccinated. Over 64% of NYC adults are fully vaccinated.”</p>

        <p>ABC is a secondary source, with each quote I provided sourced back to the CDC or a state health agency.  But if any source connected to a government agency or reported by a known media outlet is immediately to be taken as fake news, I’ll have to “do my research” and find the real sources of truth on YouTube and social media.</p>
<p>It’s quite possible that this is not all a grand conspiracy and simply a challenging and unique situation being managed by fallible, sometimes corruptible, but largely well-intentioned individuals who have dedicated their careers to healthcare and science.  Is that even remotely possible in your worldview?</p>
<p>I didn’t mean my tone to be disrespectful, btw.  I’m truly interested in your response.</p>

        <p>100% of people getting seriously ill are unvaXXXed....</p>
<p>Let me fix the sensational headlines.  Now I made this up but it's the jist of what you see.</p>
<p>&rt;"We did an analysis where we looked only at hospitalized individuals who were unvaccinated and our analysis showed that 100% of the people who were hospitalized were indeed unvaccinated.  </p>
<p>&rt;Let us add a footnote for clarity to state that the CDC is not currently aggregating the numbers for individuals who have been vaccinated and are in the hospital because they don't require testing of vaccinated individuals.  However when those numbers are examined by other countries like the UK, so as to offer an accurate picture, they find that actually the majority of the hospitalized patients have had two doses of the vaccine."</p>
<p>Then CNN turns that into an article that reads.</p>
<p>"100% of hospitalized patients in the US are unvaccinated"</p>

        <p>you're "unvaccinated" until 14 days from your second shot (or the one shot jnj). </p>
<p>The numbers are also misleadingly skewed as you will also see reports like</p>

        <p>It's propaganda, but not entirely made up by the media. The data is being manipulated during collection. Unvaccinated people are tested much more aggressively and are labeled COVID hospitalizations/deaths if they tested positive, regardless of symptoms or co-morbidities. EVERY unvaccinated person in the hospital for anything at all is tested with PCR settings known to produce some false positives, and a positive result = labeled a COVID case. Vaccinated people don't get tested unless they're hospitalized for symptoms consistent with COVID, with different, stricter testing standards.</p>
