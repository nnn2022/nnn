        <p>No, the brain-dead doomers are the population. Auto the autopilot is the government: willing to kill anything and anyone to keep control.</p>
<p>Auto keeps them blind to their true status, fills their ears with only uplifting messages it produces, and feeds their comforts so that they need never suffer want.</p>

        <p>There is more to life than living, everyone seems to have forgotten that over the past year.</p>
<p>Life is full of risk. To remove all risk is to remove all life, and all you'll have left is an empty existence. </p>
<p>Life is all about spending time with loved ones, it's about travelling and seeing new places, it's about going to a work you love, it's about going out to eat and to sports games. Most sane people will risk the remote chance of dying from the flu to experience all of this, but because of hypochondriac doomers we've had our lives quashed to appease them.</p>

        <p>I honestly don’t think 90% of these doomers would mind a world where they are told exactly what to do every day. They’d happily put on their government mandated safety helmets and masks, pump up their inflatable water wings, and cautiously make their way to their at home office to drone away for the next 12 hours. As long as the man on the TV said they were being good boys and girls. It’s honestly pathetic.</p>

        <p>It’s not about that. It’s about individual freedom. Like in Wall-e. The autopilot wouldn’t allow them to return to earth because it was to contaminated and polluted. However, the captain realized that he doesn’t want to be stuck on a ship floating through space, he wants to live out his life freely and return to earth. That’s what this is all about.

Are you trying to kill grandmas?!?!?!? Every time you go to a fast food store you are supporting a system that kills grandmas you fucking right wing nazi!!!!!!

        <p>nobody killed anyone ELSE by eating too much fast food. plenty people have died of covid who did everything in their power to not get it, just because you fuckers decided your right to spit in peoples faces at bars was more important than their right to fucking live. you can make choices that affect your life, but what gives you the right to make those choices for others?</p>
<p>you selfish cucks cannot IMAGINE a world where ANYONE BUT YOU matters. you cannot IMAGINE a world where YOUR DECISIONS affect the ability of others to choose to FUCKING LIVE. im all for people eating themselves to death cuz they dont give everyone else at walmart diabetes too, they get the consequences of their own fucking actions. a good amount of the people dying of covid are feeling the consequences of the actions of others, the actions of people like you who couldve just stayed inside and worn a mask for 6 FUCKING WEEKS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS, and HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WOULDNT HAVE DIED PAINFULLY. you couldnt even pretend to care about others for 6 fucking weeks, nd because of that half a million people died who wouldnt have died otherwise.</p>
<p>but go ahead, think of yourselves as the lions while you go around making everyone elses lives harder, and prolonging this pandemic for as long as humanly possible. im fucking tired. im tired of trying to teach people that they arent the only people on this goddamn planet. im tired of this god damn pandemic, and the people like you who are keeping the cases as high as you can manage. im tired arguing math with people who couldnt get into college.</p>

        <p>Lol if you’re going to bring math and education into it, I’m pretty sure the guy with multiple rental homes and a close to six digit salary at the age of 27 (me) can do some math better than the guy who has to resort to cursing every two seconds and straw man arguments to win a conversation. (Yes I did use cursing in my previous comment but I was being facetious)  the issue I have is that if you actually do look at the math and the statistics, and compare it to other things going on in this world, the reaction to this “pandemic” is nowhere near close to what it should be.</p>

        <p>Lol.  My passive income is most likely higher than your income from your 9 to 5 job.  The reason I am successful at investing whereas other people just blindly put money in the stock market and hope for a return is because of my ability to access risk versus return, which is mostly statistics. The whole point I’m making is that I make a bunch of money barely doing anything because of my ability to math. Not only that but the math I’m specifically making money off of is statistics. So don’t go on about how you’re so smart whereas I wouldn’t even be able to pass a college level math class while I’m making more while doing nothing because of math than you will make working your butt off at your 9 to 5.</p>
<p>And the whole point of why I don’t trust the covid reaction is because of my grasp on statistics.</p>

Don’t make an assumption and then when I tell you nah that’s not it, act like it’s me being sensitive about it. </p>
<p>When you take into account population growth, the 2019 death rate was 8.78 out of 1000 would die, and the 2020 death rate was 8.8 out of 1000 would die. This is why statistics are misleading, because you probably just looked at the total death rates without taking into account population growth over year.</p>

<p>You have every right to walk out your front door this morning and climb aboard public transportation, even while being infected with a disease that could kill a fellow passenger's entire family. Because there is no law on the books requiring you to get tested for each and every contagious pathogen before leaving home and exposing yourself to others. For all you know, you are "Covid John/Jane," a permanent asymptomatic carrier of the virus. Until someone <strong>proves</strong> that you are a danger to others, though, you have the right to move about as you choose.</p>
<p>If people want to avoid infections, they are free to stay safely within their own four walls, or wear layers of PPE whenever they do venture out. But they aren't permitted to demand that the rest of the world do the same.</p>

<p>Companies are not allow to operate since they pollute and that could put me in the hospital.</p>
<p>People being unhealthy are now mandated to workout and eat right since their comprised immune system allows them to spread any sickness more might put me in the hospital.</p>
<p>No one is allowed to use heat for cooking as this may lead to fire and put someone in the hospital.</p>
<p>We must be in padded rooms all time with nothing else in it eating cold foods to ensure everyone is as safe as possible since we can't take any risk!</p>

        <p>1: cars require a license and expensive insurance and their use is pretty stringently regulated. this is a terrible example</p>
<p>2: companies have regulations placed on them to limit/reduce their carbon footprints, and regulations limiting their ability to pollute. they arent regulated ENOUGH yet in my opinion, but thank you for bringing that up, because i also believe that to be true, so its a terrible example</p>
<p>3: in most states it is a crime to intentionally or recklessly spread a communicable disease, i.e. sharing a needle with someone when you have HIV. terrible example</p>
<p>4: reckless use of flammable material is already a crime, and people get fined for starting fires even accidentally. terrible example</p>
<p>life is a constant danger of death, but that doesnt mean we should allow people to raise that danger for others. if i came up to you and threw a knife at your head and it barely missed, should i be congratulated as a hero because i showed you how dangerous life is? or should i be arrested for almost killing you with a knife.</p>

        <p>&rt;1: cars require a license and expensive insurance and their use is pretty stringently regulated. this is a terrible example</p>
<p>So no one dies from vehicles at all then because of these measures? If your arguement is atleast families get paid from the death of their child through insurance that kind of throws out your arguemnt position of caring that people die. Terrible rebuttal.</p>
<p>&rt;2: companies have regulations placed on them to limit/reduce their carbon footprints, and regulations limiting their ability to pollute. they arent regulated ENOUGH yet in my opinion, but thank you for bringing that up, because i also believe that to be true, so its a terrible example</p>
<p>But the arguement with covid is that even one death is to many. Any amount of pollution is a danger to people so sorry regulation alone won't stop deaths. Shut em down!! Terrible rebuttal.</p>
<p>&rt;3: in most states it is a crime to intentionally or recklessly spread a communicable disease, i.e. sharing a needle with someone when you have HIV. terrible example</p>
<p>So sick until proven healthy eh? This is for diseases that are sure to kill you. These laws also are the same for if you walked up and shot someone. If you want to apply these rules for intention murder to just living life then we should go back and charge anyone who gave the elderly the flu or a cold, those monsters! Covid has a 99.98% survival rate. Its like comparing the plauge to the flu. Terrible rebuttal.</p>
<p>&rt;4: reckless use of flammable material is already a crime, and people get fined for starting fires even accidentally. terrible example</p>
<p>Again does that stop it from happing? No so it should be out right banned to stop it all together. As long as it saves one life am I right? Terrible rebuttal.</p>
<p>&rt;life is a constant danger of death, but that doesnt mean we should allow people to raise that danger for others. if i came up to you and threw a knife at your head and it barely missed, should i be congratulated as a hero because i showed you how dangerous life is? or should i be arrested for almost killing you with a knife.</p>
<p>Sigh yes because this is the same as someone just walking down a road and say I chased by aciddent a part of the concrete side walk to shift. Now you come along and trip on it and fell in a way that killed. Did I intention ally murder you? Or was it a chain of events no one could have for seen or stopped? Anyone reason would look down and go, "shit it cracked and shifted. Guess it wasn't made very well" and expect people to not trip and die on it. Again I have no obligation to setup cones and tape it off and child proof it for others. Look down, be careful, and take precations if you might die from it. So does that make me a murder?</p>
<p>This is far more accurate of an anology then you seeking to harm someone and missing. If you can't comprehend this then your mind state is already  of a perpetual victim that everyone is intentionally out to get you. That's nothing I can fix but sadly the frail mentalitly of people now a days.Terrible rebuttal.</p>
<p>&rt;others right to live doesnt end where your "fun living" begins.</p>
<p>Well I believe you to be a danger to my right to live, so does that mean I have a right to keep you in your house for ever now? Since I believe that beyond common sense and with no evidence? That's what your asking!</p>

        <p>1: you were saying we shouldnt regulate how people walk around in public, because we dont regulate how people drive their cars. i said we do regulate how people drive their cars to reduce deaths and property damage.</p>
<p>2: you were saying we shouldnt regulate how people walk around in public, because we dont regulate how companies pollute. i said we are trying to start regulating how companies pollute, to reduce deaths and property damage</p>
<p>3: where in the ever loving fuck are you getting 99.98% from? confirmed cases are at 32 million, confirmed deaths are at half a million, thats a survival rate of 98.5%. estimates are that only about 1/8th of covid cases end up with a positive test confirmation, so a better number would be 98.8%. even if you believe not all covid deaths were actually FROM covid, to get down to 99.98% youd have to assume that only 1-10% of covid deaths are actually covid deaths, which is a fuckin crazy estimate and necessarily assumes that the people counting are lying to us, which makes the numbers meaningless to begin with, including your bullshit figure.</p>
<p>i never said one death was too many. i said half a fucking million deaths is too many.</p>

<p>You original premise is that no one is allowed to put someone in the hospital. The things I stated can lead to putting someone in the hospital thus my points were valid. Stop trying to refame what was said to make what you said less insane. You lost. It was an idoitic premise with no base in reality, hence why it was so easy to destroy.</p>
<p>&rt;3: where in the ever loving fuck are you getting 99.98% from? confirmed cases are at 32 million, confirmed deaths are at half a million, thats a survival rate of 98.5%. estimates are that only about 1/8th of covid cases end up with a positive test confirmation, so a better number would be 98.8%. even if you believe not all covid deaths were actually FROM covid, to get down to 99.98% youd have to assume that only 1-10% of covid deaths are actually covid deaths, which is a fuckin crazy estimate and necessarily assumes that the people counting are lying to us, which makes the numbers meaningless to begin with, including your bullshit figure.</p>
<p>Struck a nerve here I guess. Well to start off last year I looked through a lot of the raw data with covid classifications and a majority of them were death "with" covid, not by. Also first time a lot of countries changed how they classified what was the cause of death. In this case it was covid. So if you had cancer but died with a positives pcr test it was counted as death by covid in the CDC's statics of how they died even though the root cuase was different. And numbers are lower again due to the high pcr test failure rate. I know people who have tested both positive and negative multiple times in a day. And beyond this if your under 70 and healtly it's rare for you to die of it so yes, for the majority of the population its around 99.98%. Those that due are already immunocompromised would suffer the same fate due to other illnesses. So why haven't we taken these precautions for these before before this?? Common sense use to be you don't restrict the majority for the few. Also the average life expectancy hasn't changed. If this virus is as horrible as you think shouldn't that have moved lower?? In stead the people who normally die at that age are.</p>
<p>First I've seen in history we were willing to forfeit the future generations for the past. Now I'm not advocating for elderly death here. Just stating what is a fact of life and what has been know for thousands of years up until the last 2 years. Your arguing from an emotional position not by logic based in reality.</p>
<p>So once again the argument that no one is allowed to do anything that results in a "might put me in the hospital" indirectly is childish and wishful thinking that reaps no benefits but will in fact harm people. Last thing I will leave you with since you lack the education to grasp basic concepts in life is:  please stop having a victim mentality and live life!!</p>

        <p>&rt;I know people who have tested both positive and negative multiple times in a day.</p>
<p>thats because the false positive rates and negative rates are different. the test you can take multiple times in a day and get results that day has a 25% false negative rate but only a 0.5% false positive rate. meaning that if you have it, and you get tested half a dozen times, youll probably have 3-5 positives and 1-3 negatives, but if you dont have it, you'd need to take this test a couple hundred times to be likely to get a positive. if you get some positive and some negative, you have it. if you get only negative, you dont have it. why do you think theyd test one person so many times in a day? the test that takes a few days to get results is much more accurate, though.</p>
<p>the original premise i had was that you dont have the right to put someone in a hospital. walking around without a mask can put someone in a hospital. driving recklessly can put someone in a hospital. excessive polluting can put someone in a hospital. burning down a building can put someone in a hospital. theres only one item on this list THAT ISNT ILLEGAL. WHICH IS MY WHOLE FUCKING POINT.</p>
