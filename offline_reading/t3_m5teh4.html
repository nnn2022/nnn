        <p>I admire Feynman, loved his book, amazing guy who had an amazing life.</p>
<p>He talks about pseudoscience but I think most of stuff related to COVID is not even that, it is worse (I'm not talking about vaccines - I'm talking about government enforced rules and restrictions).</p>
<p>It is the problem with "soft" systems that have a large human element and are impossible to replicate or A/B test as we do not have two planet Earths - <strong>medicine and economics</strong> are probably the best examples of such soft systems.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea if Feynman would do better if he were a prime minister/president of some country right now but based on his life philosophy described in his books, I'd guess his approach would be much more libertarian and common sense.</p>

        <p>Sadly, the field of public health has been infected with by pseudoscience, particularly when it comes to equity. Equity is the reason we’re stuck wearing masks, since the “experts” believe it’s unfair that your retail workers close to minimum wage have to go into work and risk getting the virus while middle/upper income people can work from home. Equity is the reason the vaccine rollout has been so fucked up, since millions of vaccines have been diverted to poor, black and brown communities who are no more deserving than the rest of us to get vaccinated. The virus has not been good from an equity standpoint, but that’s no reason to make the population as a whole miserable.</p>
