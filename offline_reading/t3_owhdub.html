        <p>V4V is an amazing film. Watched it 100’s of times - literally. V is an excellent false-flag, fear mongering example. Utopia is another level entirely (IMO).</p>

        <p>Same here! Just watched it last week. It gave me hope, but I was becoming more concerned at the same time. While possible, it's highly unlikely that a 'savior' / V will just trot along and enter the scene.
Spoilers ahead:</p>
<p>It would have been better if people did the &rt;!masked march at the end of the movie by themselves instead of waiting for V to initiate the resistance!&lt;</p>
<p>A little bit off-topic: I think social justice was done right in this movie.
I can totally see how an authoritarian regime would discriminate against people on the basis of identity politics.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The movie is literally the story of what's happening today. It's just a few years down the line. But the timeline told in the movie is spot on along with what we're seeing.   </p>

        <p>I doubt it. My friend loved this movie so much that he could quote one of the big speeches. I don't know about him, but his wife got the vaccine as soon as it was available and does mask in the car ALONE selfies. I expect he's done the same. Last year they acted like they didn't care and threw parties all year, but they wouldn't talk about what was happening. </p>

Even portray conservatives oppressing homosexuals. Nah, in reality it is the homosexual mafia that forces their ideology on people and it is the liberals who are the tyrants.</p>

<p>If we ever want to get out of this, some group of people will have to articulate a vision for society divorced from the stupid 'rona rules, and convince people. In other words, we need to take a 'side'.</p>
<p>Endless complaints about elites when there are clear politicians who are better on this issue than others do nothing but serve the ruling party, who is not on your side at all.</p>

        <p>There's always going to be politics. If the citizenry simply sigh and give up, refuse to acknowledge difference and pretend its all the same, then they get what they deserve.</p>
<p>Me? I will call good good and bad bad, instead of the good is bad crap that the 'awakened' conspiracy theorists do. Have you ever wondered why all your 'awakened' people are not in charge? Have you considered it's because they're completely incapable?</p>
<p>For me politics is a game. Obviously, no politician can possibly have my interests at heart. Anyone with a head screwed on straight can see that. For one thing... they don't actually know me, and I've never met them.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean they're the same. I have to vote and advocate for those people running that will best serve my interests based on the available choices. And then advocate for policies that serve me. You know what doesn't work? Sitting back and pretending it's all the same.</p>

        <p>That's absolute bullshit mate. Politicians and politics exist because we continue to be ignorant fucks succumbing to elitism. We could have direct democracy and only have an administration that handles it all. But since people are lazy useless fucks, they rather give up their rights as autonomous beings to get this dystopian society back.</p>
<p>Please use your brain and reason beyond what others have forced on you. Most of the ideas you have aren't even your own. When was the last time you stopped and reasoned around something important, just asked yourself if your thoughts on it were your own or someone elses. You'll soon come to realise that deep down, you don't give a fuck about most it.</p>
<p>You know what the worst part is? You won't even admit it, because admitting it would mean you'd have to tear everything you've ever known and felt down and build it right back up. It's patethic and sad. Mostly sad.</p>

<p>No thanks. That sounds awful. The majority in this country want all kinds of crap I don't want.</p>

<p>Um.. the last time I reasoned about something on my own was when I figured out this covid stuff was nonsense based on the fact that all my friends predictions were wrong.</p>
<p>Then I found /r/nonewnormal and realized there were others like me.</p>
<p>That is to say... I think it's clear everyone here thinks for themselves. Now, you need to think for yourself. Do you really think that direct democracy is going to lead to better outcomes? Look at how easily society is manipulated.</p>

        <p>Direct democracy would lead to the people legislating. Would it get you the world you want? Maybe not, but it would at least get us a world that the people want, not them. What's so great about society right now?</p>
<p>I'm not an american, but I'm pretty sure you are. So lets be honest. Put aside your patriotic side and just reason with me as a fellow human.</p>
<p>-Your country is literally a war machine killing innocent civilians around the world for profit.</p>
<p>-Poverty is so wide spread that a majority of the country outside the urban areas are almost third world societies.</p>
<p>-Your leaders are raging war against it's own people in so many ways.</p>
<p>-You're divided and if the US survives as a federation it's nothing less than amazing.</p>
<p>-Your society has become a literal exporter of everything immoral. Tell me the last thing the US did or achieved to be proud of? The moon landing?</p>
<p>Now what the fuck are you voting for? What is it you think is gonna get better. When is it coming? You think Georgie jr did any better than Clinton? Trump who promised you change and ended up not doing a god damn thing? Maybe this deranged 400 year old you got now is the solution? Wake the fuck up.</p>

        <p>&rt; -Your country is literally a war machine killing innocent civilians around the world for profit.</p>
<p>Um yeah, and that's because American's like it that way. This idea you have in your mind of the average american being anti-war is just way off. Trust me. I was the only one in my entire class (was in school at the time) against the Afghan / Iraq war. Everyone, of every single party, wass all over me for that. Trust me, if you think the parties are bad... American popular democracy would be much worse. </p>
<p>&rt; Poverty is so wide spread that a majority of the country outside the urban areas are almost third world societies.</p>
<p>No it's not. I've been to and lived in rural america. I've been to and lived in many places in Europe and Asia. Americans are basically way richer. Don't believe the media propaganda.</p>
<p>&rt; -Your leaders are raging war against it's own people in so many ways.</p>
<p>For all of our faults, America has had the most feeble lockdowns and mask mandates compared to Europe and Australia. I'm not exaclty sure what you're referring to here though, since it could be a lot.</p>
<p>&rt; -You're divided and if the US survives as a federation it's nothing less than amazing.</p>
<p>In all likelihood we will, just based on history. My guess is the Eu will be long gone / unrecognizable in about 50 years. The US will likely still be here.</p>
<p>&rt; -Your society has become a literal exporter of everything immoral. Tell me the last thing the US did or achieved to be proud of? The moon landing?</p>
<p>Oh please. America is way more socially conservative than every other country. Don't believe the elitist exports. The garish images you get from hollywood are combatted daily by the 'deplorables' the foreign and American media both love to hate on. This country is made up of good and moral people (war mongering and foreign policy stupidity notwithstanding), constantly shat on by our own media and that of the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Exactly what has Sweden exported? There's nothing to be proud of in being so impotent on the world stage that the country is barely noticed. Plus, Sweden is hardly a harbinger of morality. America still has a higher percentage of children born to married parents, for example. Although, I have no idea what your 'morality' even is, since European marxists have basically taken away every meaning of that term.</p>
<p>&rt; Trump who promised you change and ended up not doing a god damn thing</p>
<p>Trump did quite a bit. Stop believing the propaganda. Man, I was not a trump voter in 2016. But by the end of his term, you can bet I was. My biggest regret was not voting for him in 2016. For the first time in almost a decade, we had seen the rise in America's real wage. There was so little unemployment in the US, that grocery stores were hiring intellectually and physically disabled people. My last grocery store clerk before covid was a quadriplegic. There was so much opportunity in this country, you could trip and have a job. I've never seen that in any country or at any other time in this country. It was amazing. Being in any American city was like living on cloud 9. So much economic activity. So much bustle. So many people having a great time.</p>
<p>And then the democrats found a virus they could make into a big deal, to destroy the economy, force government dependence, force unemployment, and then they could hold off on actual legislation to stymy the administration to force their guy to be in charge.</p>

        <p>BS dude. the movie you brought up 100% has a political message in it, but then you want to tell others not to bring up politics. Sorry, but you are not going to bring up a movie that portrays a dystopian authoritarian universe perpetuated by conservatives (I mean they even say the conservatives in the movie) and not have someone rebut that message by pointing out the reality of today’s world.</p>

        <p>I do not disagree. The movie is good despite its political message. Also, I am not defending Republicans. I agree both political parties blow. Conservative and Liberal do not necessarily equate to republican and democrat. There are many republicans that are in fact liberal. </p>
<p>However, you yourself are trying to censor. Nothing I said was even political, it was a fact. The movie 100% has a political message of conservative = bad. There is absolutely no denying that. In addition, it is a fact that liberals are the majority of those perpetuating the infringement of freedoms that we are all here complaining about. Look at states with conservative leadership vs. states with liberal leadership. Now, tell me which states have had fewer COVID restrictions, fewer lockdowns, that have laws against vaccine passports, laws against vaccine mandates. Look at the media today. Would you agree that it heavily leans to the liberal left? Has it not aided in the actions of an authoritarian government with its lies and propaganda? Is it not ultra-liberal social media that has censored and suppressed information? Are the French president and Australian PM not liberals? Are we supposed to pretend? Am I supposed to deny all the evidence right in front of my face? I am sick of that kind of bullshit. I will call a spade a spade. The authoritarian left commandeered the name "Liberal", which in the classical sense was all about freedom and they deceived people. 100% there are sheep in wolf clothing on the right too. Lots of religious leaders are actually vipers, but right now, it's liberals trying to force me to take medicine, so fuck them.  </p>
<p>So again, what I said was a fact. The movie portrays the conservatives as tyrants, but when we look at the world today, it is actually the opposite of what I am experiencing in my day-to-day life.</p>

        <p>Thank you, MovingForward2Begin.  I've read all your posts, and I agree.  </p>
<p>When I hear someone making a "on both sides" argument, it's so feeble.  The scope of liberal tyranny and violence over the last year-and-a-half in no way compares to those of the conservatives.  Liberals and Far-Left control the culture and most institutions, and people are still terrified of the boogeyman of the rural white supremacist from flyover states.  There are a few thousand of those people and millions of authoritarian neo-libs.  It's just no comparison.</p>

        <p>I agree and we have to stop pretending that is not the case. Go to r/politics, r/News, r/anyothersubonreddit, and speak your mind. Say something against the narrative and watch how quickly you get booted or downvoted. I realize there are some bots and paid shills, but these subs have ALWAYS leaned hard left and have ALWAYS been like this, even if it is worse now, they have been echo chambers for many years. The Tyranny of the left has been building for many years.  I also get sick and tired of seeing people say "well reddit is not representative of reality." Oh yeah, it is not? Have you stepped onto a college campus in the past two decades? There are professors in medical schools apologizing for saying things like "pregnant woman." Have you not seen with your own eyes the absolute suppression of individual thought and opinion? Have you not seen cancel culture run rampant in our society canceling anyone who thinks outside of the mainstream narrative? Is our government not saying bullshit like "birthing people?" Are those things not reality?</p>
<p>We have to face reality and that is the liberal left lied to us all. They took the name Liberal, which gets its origins from the word liberty, and polluted it. A true liberal would invite debate, not call you names and attack you when you say something obvious like "there are only two biological sexes." I've been told I am a piece of shit numerous times for simply stating that obviousness of natural reality.</p>

        <p>A lot of people DID see that movie... and all it resulted in is that every wannabe anarcho-communist put one on when they wanted to mask up to do some violence; ironically the masks being majority made in China by sweatshop labor, supposedly in the effort to smash the very corporate system that made the masks possible.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can't even look at a Guy Fawkes mask anymore without associating it with those ignorant goobers who couldn't identify hypocrisy and irony if they were slapped so hard in the face by it that the stupid masks came flying off.</p>
