        <p>As a teenager, I get that it’s not easy to know what to believe. Hell, I’ve wondered at times if I’m wrong but no, I am old enough and smart enough to know how to do my own research.</p>
<p>Do not blame other citizens for having these moments stolen from you. Please remember that every single citizen is struggling with missing their own things and every citizen will handle it and respond to it differently. If people like us don’t fight for your freedom, you will never ever have much of a life ever again that doesn’t involve getting a government check and watching Netflix 24/7. You’ve been lied to about your government. They don’t care about you. They don’t want a better life for you. They want you dependent on them. They want you under their thumb. </p>
<p>The citizens out here trying to live despite all of this are each experiencing their own worlds collapsing and not everyone will ever play by the rules you think they should. Don’t carry anger at your fellow citizens. Carry anger at a government that’s lying to you and wants you miserable.</p>

        <p>Yup, you got it right.</p>
<p>&rt;Don’t carry anger at your fellow citizens.</p>
<p>That sentence above is the point. It's to divide <strong>us</strong>. The regular non-elite people. We aren't in their group, so we are supposed to suffer, and get mad at each other.</p>
<p>It's because they are hiding things that are worse, way worse. If people united, then they wouldn't stand a chance.</p>
