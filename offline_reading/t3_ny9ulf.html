    <strong>NH high school received community backlash after it marked the hands of unvaccinated students with a sharpie for 'contact-tracing purposes' at their outdoor prom</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;"If they were on the dance floor they had to raise their hands after every three songs so their numbers could be recorded by other underclass students for contact tracing purposes," the parent wrote, according to Litchfield.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[The superintendent] added that "students who were unable to provide a vaccination card because they did not have or share a card or had not completed the full vaccination process had a number written on their hand" and that students who danced "were asked to raise their hands to determine who they were around."</p>
<p><strong>Okay here's the hilarious part, IMO. This was before the prom:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"Students will social distance during all events at the prom. Because we are allowing students to dance, it is not the expectation that students will social distance while dancing.</p>
<p>Lmao but it gets even better:</p>
<p>&rt;"It is suggested that students <strong>rotate dance floors</strong> in order to <strong>avoid close contact with other students.</strong> It is essential that students comply with this contact tracing process. Students who do not comply will not be allowed to dance and may be asked to leave the prom early."</p>
<p>What??? How does that make any sense????</p></p>

        <p>And the kids left after "prom" and did whatever the heck they wanted hopefully. When I went to prom, the school part was just for pictures. The real fun was after.</p>
