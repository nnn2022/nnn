        <p>This!!! I'm curious how much longer governments and the MSM will try to pass this off as a super dangerous and unpredictable killer virus that basically jumps at you from thin air and sneaks home with you on the soles of your shoes to attack you when you're sleeping etc. My guess is they're keeping up the narrative because they can't think of a way to backpedal without losing face.</p>

        <p>The more time passes the more we see there is actually nothing very novel about this novel coronavirus. Itâ€™s passed by coughing and doesnâ€™t actually grow legs and chase you down the street or hide in your closet to come out and chew your toes at night?! No shit whoda thought? Too bad a lot of people still have no idea that the regular old flu and colds can in rare cases give you some pretty freaky and potentially dangerous symptoms like myocarditis, rash, pneumonia, etc. and the media uses these to scare people into thinking this is something more than a regular virus.</p>

        <p>I'm masstagger labeled as a "conspiracy theorist" apparently. I can't post anywhere without getting at least -12 downvotes. </p>
<p>I don't really care about the downvoters, but I'm sure a lot of lurkers don't see my lengthy link-dump posts because of them.</p>
<p>Seriously why would you let someone else "tag and label" other people, and believe it? I could understand if it was built to tag shills and bots but I'm neither of those....</p>
<p>This is one of the most unhelpful websites on the planet, I joined this site because it kept showing up in search engines and finding an answer was impossible so I decided to become part of the solution. I always organize by "controversial" now so I can find the users like me who post evidence, link-dumps, and coherent thoughts.</p>
<p>edit: Here is a recent example of vote manipulation; I have a hard time believing that users on this sub even saw this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ilnta1/free_c0nv1d_lawsuit_template_frud_st0pper5/ A free lawsuit template like this is incredibly useful to a lot of people on this sub, I can see that it applies to many of the "So this happened today..." posts. Spread the link there around as much as you can I'm obviously not here to milk upvotes.</p>
<p>Apparently my algorithm thwarting attempt did not work.</p>
<p>Another good example: https://np.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/impf6r/algal_blooms_due_to_human_agriculture_and_rising/ God forbid I actually draw some correllation to an issue that everybody is ignoring.</p>

        <p>Your claim that we didn't learn anything new about the virus that doesn't apply to others in the same family is incorrect. From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758">NEJM</a>...</p>
<p>&rt;When Covid-19 burst onto the global scene, public health officials initially deployed interventions that were used to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, including symptom-based case detection and subsequent testing to guide isolation and quarantine. This initial approach was justified by the many similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including high genetic relatedness, transmission primarily through respiratory droplets, and the frequency of lower respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, and shortness of breath) with both infections developing a median of 5 days after exposure. However, despite the deployment of similar control interventions, the trajectories of the two epidemics have veered in dramatically different directions. Within 8 months, SARS was controlled after SARS-CoV-1 had infected approximately 8100 persons in limited geographic areas. Within 5 months, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2.6 million people and continues to spread rapidly around the world</p>
<p>And if you'd like more detail...</p>
<p>&rt;What explains these differences in transmission and spread? A key factor in the transmissibility of Covid-19 is the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract,1 even among presymptomatic patients, which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract.2 Viral loads with SARS-CoV-1, which are associated with symptom onset, peak a median of 5 days later than viral loads with SARS-CoV-2, which makes symptom-based detection of infection more effective in the case of SARS CoV-1.3 With influenza, persons with asymptomatic disease generally have lower quantitative viral loads in secretions from the upper respiratory tract than from the lower respiratory tract and a shorter duration of viral shedding than persons with symptoms,4 which decreases the risk of transmission from paucisymptomatic persons (i.e., those with few symptoms).</p>

        <p>This is grasping at straws. That's not new, just a variation on the same thing. Does it replicate in the respiratory tract? Yes. It applies to the others in the family, because they also replicate there. It doesn't replicate in your liver. If it did that, then you would have an argument, but it doesn't. Where in the respiratory tract? Irrelevant, it's still a respiratory virus.</p>
<p>Difference in spread doesn't make it a unicorn either. Every virus has its own infectivity.</p>
<p>The only thing different was our mindset. We were stupid enough to try and control a virus when we should have just allowed it to burn itself out in its own course. One that spreads much faster and is far less deadly than its cousin just doesn't make sense to spend worldwide trillions of dollars to try and inevitably fail to contain. SARS1 was contained because it spread slowly and had a high death rate so it burned itself out.</p>
<p>It's a new breed of dog. It might look and act a bit different from the others, but in the end it's going to act like a dog, it's not going to start flying.</p>

        <p>Because nothing in there is new. Find me an article that proves that SARS COV2 primarily attacks the liver or neurons and replicates there, and no other HCoV did so before, and I will concede. I won't accept a source that says they found viral fragments, because I know that there will be at least one case where the circulatory system deposits pieces there.</p>
<p>Lastly, your 2nd source compares the main sites of viral load between the flu and SARS COV2, not other HCoVs. It's still irrelevant, because it's still the respiratory system. Even if all other 7 HCoVs replicate in the lower respiratory tract and this one is a unicorn, then this fact that changes nothing about mitigation and treatment prcedures is splitting hairs.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's the entire point of the article.</p>
<p>The main point of the article is that the US should do more to shield and protect nursing homes which are extremely vulnerable. Although, it's from late May so anything that was gping to be done should have been done way before. The article isn't talking about anything new. Like I said before, find something that this coronavirus does that the others don't, like stay dormant in neural ganglia, and you have a valid point. Because as long as it spreads by respiratory way, you have no valid point. This took an example of the worst coronavirus which spread incredibly slowly and killed more and is surprised when mitigation efforts that worked withit didn't with this one.</p>

        <p>Since you're really asking for it, then here. Here are some articles on immune response, something actually clinically relevant. Something that would have been a gamechanger if it actually was different.</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770758</p>
<p>https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/t-cells-found-covid-19-patients-bode-well-long-term-immunity</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.23.20179796v1</p>
<p>This virus ilicits the same immune response, coming to the same conclusion. Truthfully, these should all have been assumed from the beginning, instead we had both scientists and idiots yelling "there's no immunity!" This is clinically relevant, this matters, unlike the comparison of replication zones between this virus and the flu. If this was different, we would be in trouble. If it had the mechanism to latch onto CD4+ T Cell surface receptors and hide in them like HIV does, we would be in big trouble. But it doesn't. Because it doesn't have the mechanism to do so, because it's a coronavirus and coronaviruses lack those mechanisms.</p>
<p>https://www.jimmunol.org/content/early/2020/09/03/jimmunol.2000839</p>
<p>Oh, look. Coronaviruses are so similar that healthy donor T Cells can recognize specific antigen epitopes from SARS-CoV 2. Vice-versa for other HCoVs.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32726801/</p>
<p>And so we come back to the original point. If this replicated in hepatocytes like hepatitis A, B, C, D, or laid dormant in peripheral neural ganglia like HSV, or climbed the nerves to the CNS like rabies virus, or attacked and destroyed T cells in the body like HIV, something which none of the coronaviruses do, only then can we say that it isn't like any of the other coronaviruses we have seen. And so far, we have no evidence suggesting these.</p>

        <p>&rt;We found out nothing new about this so-called "novel" virus that doesn't apply to others in the same family.</p>
<p>As the article states, health officials attempted to follow your advice and <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758">treat it like Sars</a>, and yet it didn't respond. Because it's a new coronavirus. Whether you're impressed with how new it is is irrelevant.</p>
<p>I'm tired of your dancing around your erroneous claim and am leaving you to your echo chamber.</p>

        <p>That's fully on the health officials. We knew it was far more contagious than SARS1 from the beginning, trying to eradicate it was a stupid idea that was never going to work. Doesn't disprove anything I said.</p>
