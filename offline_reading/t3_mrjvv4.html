    <strong>restrictions of freedom of movement and freedom of assembly are an attack on body autonomy</strong>
    <p><p>the use of emergency laws to prevent people meeting others where-ever when-ever for how long they wish to move in what enjoyable mode they would choose</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>equals to an attack on body autonomy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my body my choice</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>its important for the wellness of my mind, my soul and my physical body that I can anticipate meeting my fellow buddies and flood my body with bio-chemical happy molecules thinking how I will meet my loved partner(s) anytime soon this evening, how we will heal each other by exchanging all sorts of sweating breathing ... activities with nothing in between us, nothing to separate us but we fully becoming one in harmony</p></p>

        <p>Easy. Identify as a Black Lives Matter protestor that’s transgender and vaccinated by systemic racism. No one would touch you with a 1000 ft pole. I’m white and covered in tattoos but changing to black trans vaxed has changed my life. I go where I want. I get Nikes from free. Curfews mean fuckall to me. I thought White privilege was nice but not anymore.</p>

        <p>there were some more than 10 million human beings what have been abducted from africa, brought to the americas against their wish, they and their descendants being enslaved over more then 300 years ... something like during 10 generations ....</p>
<p>also there were living more than hundred million indigenous people in the americas before the white skinned european settlers arrived to take away most all of their homelands</p>
<p>and all because our european ancestors were not standing up to their feudal oppressors in europe but fled overseas to steal someone else's land</p>
<p>so much for white pride</p>
<p>there is nothing to be proud of wearing a white skin, much to the contrary...</p>

        <p>my oppinion is that restricting freedom of movement and freedom of assembly results in an attack on body autonomy as ... my body, my choice ... includes the ability to be able to go out whenever one is motivated to meet with whomever one feels happy to engage in a group sports activity ... while of course walking on ones own in the forest admiring natures beauty is a perfect choice to engage in a soft exercise not only for the mind, the feelings ( enjoying natures beauty ) but also smoothly allows body circulation ... some of us need or greatly profit from having the incentive of meeting with others to play ball games, run together ( without stupid masks ) or just plain rave a whole night trough loosing oneself in an orgasmic dance ecstasy surrounded by hundreds of sweaty smelly people all too enjoying each others clouds of bacteria and viruses emitted ...</p>
<p>there is not yet being given enough attention to how we can exchange our very own catalog of microbes living in our bodies and our skins, how we can exchange our very own collection of viruses we gathered trough our lifespans ... how the spontaneous meeting of people one to one or in groups of five, fifty or five hundred people </p>
<p>how we greatly profit when being exhausted but happy, when we breath on each other full of pleasure, excited with the movements we enjoy together</p>
<p>how this is positively enhancing our own biomes and viromes</p>
<p><a href="https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/">https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/</a></p>
<p>"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."</p>
