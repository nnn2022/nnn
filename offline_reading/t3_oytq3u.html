        <p>Serious question; are you not concerned about the long term effects of contracting a severe case of Covid, or death? I’m not attempting to change your mind or argue with you about the vaccine, I’m just curious.</p>

        <p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>You see, I don't just read Conspiracy Theory sites.</p>
<p>I have learned about covid itself.</p>
<p>I've seen doctors explain it's mechanism of disease, and the explanation offered fits exactly with the real world data I see.</p>
<p>I am confident, that being in reasonable health, snd maintaining a well supported immune system, that Covid is nothing more than a minor inconvenience.</p>
<p>The people that get seriously ill had poor immune systems and were low on Zinc. 
Zinc has been shown repeatedly to block viral replication and those results have been confirmed with sars-cov-2.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the vast majority of hospitalized patients that had poor Long Term outcomes were deficient in Vitamin D.
Vitamin D Deficiency is so common, especially in winter at northern latitudes, that nurses are taught to just ASSUME Vitamin D deficiency.
Yet the Health Canada website said Most Canadians get sufficient Vitamin D and recommended AGAINST supplements. </p>
<p>It is an unarguable fact that naturally acquired immunity is far superior to vaccine immunity.</p>
<p>I see a problem in THIS:</p>
<p>1) There is a simple an effective treatment for this disease, but it is not being used. Studies purporting to show the drug having no benefit DO NOT FOLLOW the published treatment protocol. Unless you are prepared to believe that  the researchers are STUPID, the only conclusion one can draw is that the research was DELIBERATELY slanted to fail.</p>
<p>2) In pursuing this "vaccine", they want a shot in every arm. It's not about immunity, herd or otherwise. A positive antibody test is unacceptable. Proof of having Covid and recovering is no good. Only proof that you have had their injection.</p>
<p>3) I have seen video of doctors and researchers doing what they can on virtually no funding.
One did microscopic examination of blood cells.
Unvaccinated people's blood had round, regularly spaced cells in the plasma. 
Vaccinated blood looked damaged. Blood cells had rough irregular edges, or were even elongated and "tube" like. They were clumping together, rather than being evenly spaced in the plasma. This is a PICTURE of clumping blood cells, after a vaccine that is known to cause Blood Clots. </p>
<p>4) Another researcher, studying blood, found a reduction in the blood cells that form the Innate immune system. The Innate system is the generic antibodies that float around and attempt to identify and "choke out" invading pathogens.
A few days after infection, the body's Adaptive immune system kicks in, producing pathogen specific antibodies.
The Innate system helps to keep you from getting too sick by limiting viral load.</p>
<p>People that had been vaccinated showed much lower levels of these cells in their blood. People that had had two shots had lower levels than those with just the first shot. The older a person was when they got vaccinated, the lower the level.
Most disturbing though, was that the LONGER it had been since your vaccination, the lower the level, suggesting on-going damage.</p>
<p>We know from genome study that some of this virus resembles structures of HIV... </p>
<p>Are these doctors and studies real and legit? I don't know.</p>
<p>But I DO know that if I was in charge, and genuinely concerned about the public's health, I would HAVE to Halt things while this was investigated.</p>
<p>Instead it is covered up, and derided, and banned from platforms... why?</p>
<p>Science is about asking questions.
Anyone telling you to "Trust The Science" ISN'T following Science. </p>
<p>For me, there are far too many questions, and far too many people, not just "not answering" those questions, but actively working to SUPPRESS questions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is the Propaganda turning The Vaccinated against The Unvaccinated.
Restrictions on Unvaccinated people.
News stories blaming Unvaccinated for the new cases.
News stories blaming the unvaccinated for continuing Restrictions.
This is "Othering". It's the foundation of racism, and it's HOW THE HOLOCAUST happened.</p>
<p>Lawfair... an illegal practice in which The Process gets used as punishment.
Submit to vaccination or you can do this or that, you have to go TWICE A WEEK, at your own expense, and get a nasal swab test. 
"What about an antibody test?" 
Nope. Gotta be a nasal swab. </p>
<p>It's not about detecting illness. It's about making non-compliance painful and difficult.</p>
<p>I've seen several posts now saying variations of "My employer posted a list in the office of who was vaccinated and who wasn't".</p>
<p>In my country, (Canada), pastirs that have held church services for their own congregations have been arrested, jailed, &amp; fined by authorities AND have been victims of vandalism including arson and have received death threats.</p>
<p>They are building "Covid Camps" and there is documentation that the plan can escalate to "confining 'high risk' individuals in "blue zones" until such time as they can become vaccinated.</p>
<p>I could go on for a while, I think you get the point, by now, or at least I hope you do.</p>
