    <strong>Health Care Workers, why no whistleblowers?</strong>
    <p><p>The one thing that I can't get my head around is that for this nefarious plan to work it's pretty much required everyone who works in health care trusts and hospitals around the world to be complicit and say nothing. Yes, there are a few high profile doctors who are online and ultimately discredited but what about the hundreds of thousands of nurses, support staff, cleaners, caterers, technicians working in health care around the globe? It appears that none of those have spilt the beans to friends or family about this being a bit off? Indeed I have friends who state they know nurses etc and they without fail all confirm that hospitals were busy (admittedly months ago now). What explanation could there be for this? Have they been given a different narrative to the rest of us and their discretion is required to prevent things getting even worse?</p></p>

        <p>Registered nurse here. I openly tell my friends and family not to participate in the experiment, and since this all started have been calling out the bullshit with numbers and scaremongering. </p>
<p>I can tell you “covid,” whether it’s man made, natural, or just regular old coronavirus, is real. I can also tell you it is not as severe as they make it seem. I have 2 covid patients at work today. My local media would have you believe there’s hundreds. The numbers and situation is overblown, no doubt. At the end of the day it still has 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>100% agree with you, fellow healthcare worker here. One of my friends is a nurse working in the field doing home care and we were just talking a couple of days ago. She said she hasn't had a covid case in months and we are in New York City. She used to get quite a few a year ago. This is definitely real. But it's nowhere near what they're telling us it is. They are co-opting it and using it for nefarious purposes.</p>

        <p>100%. This is why I refuse to take part in the experiment, why would I need it for a 99% survival rate virus? There’s too many questions and too much fuckery for me to go along with it.</p>

        <p>Jon Rappoport had explained how one of the biggest tricks they’ve pulled is making people think there is “one thing”, covid, a single enemy.</p>
<p>Are you sure there is one thing called covid? Or are you dealing with several things that all ping positive on PCR?</p>

        <p>Close.  Actually we have Covid being an incidental finding and being blamed for deaths caused by other diseases.  A person has a positive PCR test.  There's Covid genetic material in their nose.  Then, they have a heart attack due to having severe existing heart disease.  That death is labeled Covid even if they had zero symptoms of Covid.</p>
<p>Almost all "Covid deaths" are actuallt due to something else.</p>

        <p>That I don’t know. Is it possible that the PCR tests are detecting something else and calling it “covid?” Maybe. However CT scans have been pretty consistent when it comes to presentation of the virus. Hard to say at this point.</p>

        <p>I think most people want to be afraid. Or they want to be “led” and told what to do. Either because it brings meaning to their lives or because they are too weak or afraid to steer their own lives.</p>

        <p>As a nurse: because we were told from the beginning of the pandemic that to speak out against what health authorities were recommending would jeopardize our jobs and license. </p>
<p>Obviously they didn't play it off as "hey nurses and doctors, the pandemic is being blown out of proportion. don't tell anybody or we will fire you" </p>
<p>It was much more subtle. They made examples of those that didn't follow covid health guidelines as being unsafe and spreading disinformation. They made the hive mind believe that being skeptical was a sure fire way to look crazy amongst your colleagues. </p>
<p>But let me tell you...most of us know it's all BS. We were there. We saw it. </p>
<p>The nurses who were in the thick of things were based in specific hospitals and areas affected by covid. The whole system was NEVER overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>There have been lots of whistleblowers:</p>
<p>first, the whisleblowers saying that they were being told to call everything covid, then the CARES Act was signed and doctors were paid for each covid case and the whistleblowing stopped</p>
<p>You then had the whistleblowers on other treatment options, and they got their medical licenses revoked</p>
<p>And then you had doctors saying the public should have informed consent in regards to the vaccine, they got fired and had all their licenses revoked</p>
<p>Then you had the inventor of mRNA vaccines and other leading vaccine researchers tell folks to be wary of the vaccine, they got deleted off platforms and "factchecked" with the factcheckers "accidentally" strawmanning them</p>
<p>The question you should be asking is: </p>
<p>there are over 10k vaccine deaths according to VAERS in the US, a BBC presenter died at 44 and vaccine is listed as the cause on her death certificate, the UK is also having a higher mortality among vaccinated than unvaccinated; and yet Canada? Why no mention of any deaths anywhere? The deaths that doctors are saying they've experienced are being denied by health officials. So, the question should be, if you are writing in good faith (although your inability to notice any of the above mentioned whistleblowers suggests you aren't) why so few vaccine deaths outside of a few places that are discussing them?</p>

        <p>The few whistleblowers that I've seen have been instantly discredited, shamed, fired, and in general made to look like a quack. It takes brave souls to risk that. We're talking about all the work involved to obtain a medical career down the tubes. And this is also why I pay attention to medical workers who speak against the narrative. What do they have to gain by putting their career at risk?</p>

        <p>We do speak out, but it falls on deaf ears.  The hospital and health department directors and managers just "take it under advisement".  We can't go to the public because it's against HIPAA to distribute patient info, and without patient specifics these occurrences are faceless anecdotes.</p>
<p>Plus, among healthcare professionals, there sre those who've drank the Koolaid.  They believe the "experts" even if the info flies in the face of everything fhey were taught.</p>
<p>My colleagues are being ordered not to ask patients if they've had the vaccines or not when they present with possible vax adverse reactions.  Also in my hospital, many experienced nurses were laid-off due to low patient census causing a unit to close (ie hospital pleading poverty).  Afterwards, they immediately reopen the unit and start hiring nurses fresh out of school.  They even doubled the referral bonus for nurses.</p>

        <p>Always funny to see “infection control” completely disregard decades of evidence based practice in favor of “that’s what CDC said.” They want us to wear N95 and face shield for ANY patient care. I don’t even wear one for covid patients, lmao. </p>
<p>I’ve said it here before, this whole bs has made me realize my coworkers are much more stupid than I originally thought.</p>

        <p>I got a ride to work from an acquaintance about a year ago. She told me how important it was with masks, vac's etc. I just changed subject since I didn't want to start debating early in the morning with someone I hadn't met in a long time.</p>
<p>Got a ride about a month ago and she was completely changed in her stance surprisingly. She have 3 nurse friends (or some slightly higher position) in my local hospital. They all said that they were told not to report vacc related injuries.</p>
<p>Was a bit shocked that even in my small/mid size town in Sweden this is a thing.</p>
