    <strong>Just another proof of the Freakshow that we live in</strong>
    <p><p>So, I was helping a friend finding a job because he needed advice with his programming career.</p>
<p>While I was looking between his viable options to apply (25), I noticed something. None of them had option for full remote work, not even in the middle of this supossed crisis. So I asked him: do you hate remote work? To which he said: I found no viable options for me with remote work.</p>
<p>My point with this:</p>
<p>1 - They tell you not to gather in large groups</p>
<p>2 - Curfew</p>
<p>3 - All the entertainment that gave you a break from the retarded job market forbidden</p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>1 - No problem forcibly almost kissing eachother in the subway, train or bus because it is completely full.</p>
<p>2 - No problem for everyone going to work at the same time and no problem forcing your workers to go to the office when work can perfectly get done remotely (I understand this is impossible in some instances).</p>
<p>3 - No problem with big companies but all problems with small or medium businesses. A programming company is essential, local food store isn't.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If this was a serious virus, all these tech companies would get forced to remote work inmediately.</p>
<p>I guess the virus is very smart. It only spreads at family meetings, parties, bars, etc. It seems to only attack the areas that made the average person's life a bit worth it. Also it seems to me that it only targets the small and medium business owners.</p>
<p>Also, they ask for every possible expertise in web development + 2 languages while paying between 1000-1300â‚¬ of net money lol</p>
<p>How do we accept this bullshit?</p>
<p>So you are free to go to work and have your boss bully you in exchange for a missery wage but you are not free to do everything that is supossed to give you a mild break from all the bullshit you endure everyday?</p>
<p>Why isn't there a mass revolt already against the banks, big tech, big corps and everyone that made this bullshit world possible?</p></p>
