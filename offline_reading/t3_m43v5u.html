        <p>I think it's more related to the fact thay Harry is not related to the queen. He doesn't look like prince Charles, and looks too much like princess Diana's lover. You can see pictures in this article <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-harry/11315109/Prince-Harry-was-fathered-by-James-Hewitt-new-play-claims.html">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-harry/11315109/Prince-Harry-was-fathered-by-James-Hewitt-new-play-claims.html</a></p>
<p>In that 1000 year old family blood lineage matters quite a bit. So, they were kicked out, and the whole Oprah interview is just a scandal monetization thingy. Americans will easily believe that Archie is one of the blackest people in the world, and that this couple was opressed for being marginalized and underprivileged.</p>
