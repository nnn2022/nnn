    <strong>[U.S.] My public school system is such bullshit</strong>
    <p><p>My super liberal public high school did a mock AP test in person, which I attended, today. Each weekday, the school asks us to complete a survey asking if we have COVID symptoms, which is super easy to lie on. Then you're supposed to show that the survey emailed you a green checkmark after completing it when you enter the school. The problem is, I am frugal enough to not have a smartphone (I actually go through a forbidden path where there's nobody to check that green checkmark). And the AP Test forbids electronic devices. How the hell do I enter school on the real AP Test day if administrators are checking it at the entrance to the testing building? Plus, we're supposed to wear a mask even during the part of the AP test where we speak to a microphone. Talk about getting misheard when speaking in a language that I just learned to fulfill future college credit.</p>
<p>And then there's having to wear a mask the whole time during track &amp; field practice. My mask gets sweaty as fuck; it's like tissue trying to be flushed down the toilet but it can't because tissue doesn't dissolve. I'm already fully vaccinated and the school coach is being a bitch about it. It doesn't make any sense. My school is allowing extracurricular sports ASSUMING COVID has a tough time spreading around. If I don't wear a mask, that assumption still holds true thanks to my vaccination. I can't believe just showing your bare nose disrespects my coach.</p></p>

        <p>Don't have any particular advice but it's good to know that there are still some sane zoomers out there. Every kid I see now is either a fucked up antisocial loser or else some neurotic nerd wimp. No in between, when in reality being successful at life takes both intelligence and a spine.</p>

        <p>Good thing those covid germs canâ€™t make it thru your sweaty mask onto your hands. Your coach needs a straight jacket.</p>
