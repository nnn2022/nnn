    <strong>"Nuance? We Don't Know Her: Why COVID-19 Is Destroying My Mental Health In Ways I Never Thought Possible And Created Caricatures Out Of You &amp; Me: A Story About Face Masks - Acts 1-69"</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, r/NoNewNormal. This is my first Reddit post ever. The following started out as a Facebook response to a friend's (F29) status detailing the audacity of a stranger at 7Eleven who was not wearing a mask indoors and literally doing nothing else that could be considered a crime. It quickly turned into a rant/stream of consciousness of my own, however. I never responded to my friend's Facebook status, but I still wanted to share it somewhere. I apologise if it's not 100% cohesive -----</p>
<p>This little ditty is called, "Nuance? We Don't Know Her: Why COVID-19 Is Destroying My Mental Health In Ways I Never Thought Possible And Created Caricatures Out Of You &amp; Me: A Story About Face Masks - Acts 1-69"</p>
<p>Six years ago when I was working as a cashier at a gas station in Nowhere, Wyoming, there was a regular customer who I grew to dislike almost immediately. This was a man in his 40s or 50s with a permanently hateful expression on his face. He never spoke a word to me or anyone else, never made eye contact, always tossed his balled up money on the counter instead of handing it to us, and never ever said "thank you" or "bye." After he'd left the gas station one morning I vented to a coworker about this dickhead only to learn that my coworker knew this person somewhat and had been able to piece together his story over the years (small towns, am I right?). </p>
<p>Turns out that this disagreeable customer (David) was completely deaf from childhood and eventually become alienated from the world. David's parents didn't properly provide for his needs which resulted in having to deal with lifelong bullying and remaining an outsider to his peers. After 40+ years of frustration, loneliness, unable to hold down a job, living off of Welfare, and never gaining the tools to navigate productivity through world as a deaf person, this man essentially adopted the attitude of, "fuck it," and gave up trying.</p>
<p>There's little excuse for intentionally shitty behavior towards another person. However, it's very rare that we're able to grasp the full picture of another human being's existence and appreciate why they might be the way they are, based on one interaction alone. I'd venture to guess that most people wouldn't hold up very well, either, to decades of never feeling like you're capable of making a human connection. David was an asshole, but thinking about being in his shoes was heartbreaking. Without insight from my former coworker about this regular customer with a bad attitude, it would have been too easy to continue traveling down the rabbit hole of assumptions I, as well as other, had made about him. </p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p>Over the past several months, the common (and socially encouraged) response I've seen to a stranger smugly walking around in public unmasked is generally something along the lines of, "Do you see that?? How can a person be so selfish and reckless? Bet they own a MAGA hat... I genuinely can't understand why they don't care about the lives of others. Absolutely disgusting. Just wear an effing mask, it's not hard! All of these Republican anti-maskers need to be fined or given jail time. I weep for the future..."</p>
<p>So, that's all it takes to completely suss out a person's entire character? The single fact that they're not wearing a mask tells you everything you need to know about them, period, full stop? They look like they should be able to wear a mask so, why aren't they? There couldn't possibly be any reason whatsoever in the history of God's green earth not to do exactly what you, yourself, are doing? None? No reason at all? </p>
<p>"But if you can't wear a face covering, you shouldn't be going out anyway. You need to be at home. Get DoorDash delivered. Get your groceries delivered. If you can't afford it just get a credit card or borrow money from your mom. Talk to your family on Zoom. Just work from home, it's easy! I know it sucks, but it'll only be for two weeks. Just two weeks. Catch up on Netflix while you're at it!"</p>
<p>It's dangerous to ascribe such malicious intent to strangers. And it's borderline schizophrenic reasoning to believe that people you've never met are directing ill will towards you and everyone you love by virtue of having a bare face. Until a maskless person is invading your personal space, and coughing directly onto you, who cares? So anti-maskers are dicks. Who gives a shit? Most people are going along to get along in the way that's easiest for them, yourself included. You have the agency to protect yourself and protect your loved ones, and if that means keeping your distance from strangers, so be it. Others have the agency to live their lives as well. Someone not wearing a mask down the isle from you doesn't infringe on your rights, personally. Someone being verbally abusive to you infringes on your rights. A person purposefully coughing or sneezing on you infringes on your rights. Having your facemask ripped off of you unwillingly infringes on your rights. But it's not illegal to have unpopular beliefs or commit Wrongthink.</p>
<p>Not every single thing falls on the side of either Jane Fonda or literally Hitler. People are complicated, and righteously assuming the intention of a perfect stranger does nothing but push the world closer to hell.</p></p>

<p>As the world gets bigger and more complex, people are reacting by relying more and more on simplistic heuristics and binaries.</p>

        <p>You're so right, what you have posted is so well written.</p>
<p>We are hearing more stories of friendships ending and families being torn apart due to the big mask debate. There is no reasoning or understanding, just " do as you're told " and being treated as if you are a child.</p>
<p>I don't understand the people who are judging others who are not wearing a mask, especially making assumptions on their political stance. </p>
<p>It's not as simple as that. it's like I've said before the majority of pro mask/pro lockdown people come onto this sub on the attack. Where as I've found the anti mask/anti lockdown people at least the majority listen to other opinions, and the news then make up their own minds. </p>
<p>Just because someone is anti lockdown doesn't mean they don't wear a mask, just because someone  is pro lockdown doesn't mean they do wear a mask.</p>
<p>It's causing so much hate.</p>

<p>This flies in the face of the spirit of your post, but...</p>
<p>As it happens, this <em>is</em> all I need to know about somebody’s thought process. Is there complexity behind their stance on this matter? Perhaps. But I find that fact to be irrelevant. These people are control-obsessed wannabe-authoritarians. They are incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>They are desperate to control you, in the most obscene and intrusive matters. The more intimate the matter, the harder they wish to clamp down on you.</p>
<p>Societies always have vast reservoirs of these cretins, waiting just below the surface to be given the green light to...rat out the Jews hiding under the floorboards next-door. Or snitch on their neighbor, so when the neighbor is taken away and shot in the basement of the Lubyanka, they can make a move on their widow.</p>
<p>I appreciate your post and I read it in the spirit in which it is intended. But I stand by my harsh judgment of those who wish to, at any cost, force their depravity upon others.</p>
