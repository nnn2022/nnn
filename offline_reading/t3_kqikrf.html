    <strong>There Are More of Us Than We Realize</strong>
    <p><p>I was doing a tour of an apartment out in the suburbs, and after realizing it didn’t fit what I’m looking for, I walked over to another one nearby hoping to get a walk-in tour. I asked the receptionist if they take in walk-ins and she said no. I said is that because of covid. She proceeded to explain the procedure and how to book a tour online, not really answering my question. I guessed she didn’t hear me properly behind the plexiglass and my mask, so I asked her again if the no walk-ins rules because of coronavirus. She said yeah, this wasn’t the policy before. I said that sucks, she said yes I’m sorry. I said it sucks how everything we do nowadays has a road block, we’re restricted from doing most everything when we’re just young people that want to live our lives. She said yes, exactly in avid agreement and nodded her head. I said I’m glad other people feel the same way I do, I thought I was crazy. We continued talking a little and she said let me see if I can do something for you about an immediate appointment. She went on back then came back and said sorry we can’t, but you can book one online for tomorrow. I thanked her and she told me to take it easy and all these nice pleasantries. </p>
<p>Point of the story is there are more of us than we realize. I think this was the first time I really spoke out like this to a stranger so abruptly about how I really feel regarding the lockdowns. It was a little nerve-wracking but worth it in the end. I know it won’t automatically change the world around us, but it made me feel really good to finally find someone in real life that truly feels the way I do. We aren’t alone, and need to speak out more to find solidarity and more peace of mind. It’s the only thing that keeps a lot of us going nowadays.</p>
<p>Edit: thank you everyone for sharing your stories, great to see there is some light amongst all this darkness. I can’t reply to everyone but appreciate you all, keep the good fight going you are all amazing ❤️❤️❤️</p></p>

        <p>Little interactions like these are huge. Why do you think masks and self-isolation are pushed so hard? Can't have the plebs talking about what's going on in uncontrolled ways now can we? Keep your opinions online where we can censor you or use the herd to run you over with virtue-signaling.</p>

        <p>That’s a very good point about why masks and isolation is pushed, it really is about control and the great reset after all. </p>
<p>The funny thing is online opinions are censored, loads of videos disputing the lockdowns and the virus have been deleted off YouTube, for starters</p>

        <p>The censorship is the closest thing to a smoking gun for me. Funny, mass surveillance of citizens happens, ""What does it matter if you've got nothing to hide?" But when mass censorship of anything that questions the narrative happens, well, does anyone wonder what the government/media has to hide? </p>
<p>The censorship had been getting pretty bad leading up to rona, it felt like they did a dry run with deplatforming Alex Jones, now they're taking it a step further. A doctor in my state lost his medical license for speaking at a anti-lockdown rally, where were the "anti-fascists" for that one, I wonder?</p>

        <p>A lot of real-life compliance with bullshit pandemic "control" rules and restrictions aren't done by people who wholeheartedly buy into it. They're done by the vast population of individuals who are at best apathetic about them and see it all as an inconvenience that they have to do upon pain of fines or social shaming more than zealous belief in how "effective" they are. </p>
<p>So yes. There are a lot more people like us out there. The question is how far most of them have to be pushed before enough of them stand up and say it's all bollocks and it's too much. Unfortunately for many people, that limit is limitless, because when they're so fixated on getting by day to day and surviving they won't care about anything else if it doesn't affect their wallets.</p>

        <p>That is very good point you bring up. The apathy is the real issue here and the fact that people don’t speak up further adds to all this nonsense. I’ve been speaking up with future employers, asking of their policies on masks, vaccines upon return to the office. I personally don’t care what opportunities I miss out on, friendships that fall apart, businesses I get kicked out of, this is our livelihood and freedom at stake.  I’d never give that up for anything. Spot on observation.</p>

        <p>A lot of the restrictions result in people doing less work, and they love it!  See: teachers.</p>
<p>Anyone who is still scared after nine months of this is dumb.  No piles of bodies in the streets, and most people don’t know one person who has died of this thing.  There is a giant mismatch between the official narrative and objective reality.</p>

        <p>I live in doomer central, the San Francisco Bay Area. I went to a grocery store a few days ago and mentioned to an employee that their COVID policy seemed like overkill: no hand baskets because they apparently let people get too close to each other, no standing next to the cashier while they ring up your items, no bringing your own bag.</p>
<p>To my shock, he completely agreed and we started talking about how all the restrictions are just hygiene theater, how wearing a mask outside is absurd, etc. It was really therapeutic to meet somebody in real life who didn't have COVID hysteria.</p>

        <p>Most people don’t really buy into it but just cave to the social pressure. It’s similar to tv interviews of passerby’s where they ask them what they think about restriction measures/masks and the person literally just parrots word for word a talking point like “well it’s a little inconvenient but hey if it can help us get out of this mess sooner, why not”. Chances are they think it’s total bullshit but don’t quite know how to phrase it in a socially acceptable manner.</p>

        <p>I met a couple on Sunday out ice skating. We got chatting and it soon came up that they too, were not buying into the bullshit narrative. It was honestly such a relief because just two days prior, I expressed to my husband that we were alone in our thoughts and that we'd probably be better off dead. (I was just talking, not really contemplating suicide or a family murder, so don't worry lol)</p>
<p>This couple gave me such hope again. It was like an oasis in this lockdown new normal desert, and for me, someone who was losing hope fast, it gave me an extra boost for this week. It made me feel not so alone.</p>
<p>It's amazing and uplifting to meet like minded people in the wild! They even invited us for drinks at their house and it may be the start of a well needed friendship. We need to speak out, not be afraid of expressing our views. Eventually we'll meet people who feel the same and we can make our (in real life) circle bigger!</p>

        <p>I run a shop and have 11 guys from all walks of life. 
The only one guy who is absolutely hopeless knows nothing about what's going on but can tell you full stats for the 1978 world series. Other than sports this dude is a chowder head and can't comprehend that lockdowns are bullshit. My point being, is if you think these lockdowns are still for our safety and not about control you haven't been paying attention.</p>

        <p>spoke with a checkout clerk a few weeks ago. she's fed up too. we were the only ones around, and ended up both taking off our masks and having a short chat. it was great to see another person's smile.</p>
<p>she was saying, she's behind plexiglass (and no not the kind you can lean around), we were 'socially distanced', the whole checkout takes about a minute. how is that not safe enough?</p>

        <p>While I was servicing a site during the first lockdown in the UK I had a similar conversation with a woman too. Half of my friends feel the same way but are too scared to say anything because you literally get painted as murdering granny. </p>
<p>There are a lot of people out there feelin the same. If you check out Anna Brees on FB. She used to be a BBC new reporter but left because of bias. She posts stuff that's a fun read online.</p>

        <p>I actually deal with the public outside of the shops and things and very few seem sincerely concerned about it any more. People answer their door and no-one comes out with a mask on anymore. It’s all just a show of compliance. Like cheating to pass a class in school.</p>

        <p>I live in Wyoming, but work in an oasis of sanity in Colorado. I've gotten away with going maskless at work, and I've empowered my 66 year-old(liberal) coworker to do the same. They sent out a company-wide email that said face diapers are mandatory. Okay... We haven't worn masks from the beginning, and my customers are SO supportive! I only see two or three masks out of several hundred customers in a day. It's so wonderful to encounter like-minded individuals. They know the mandate is bullshit.</p>

        <p>If we reason analogously to concerns about the new vaccines, the majority of people make their skeptical stances known when the cost of accepting the lockdown is their bodily autonomy. The <strong>majority</strong> of people have well deserved reservations about this vaccine. In contrast, the idea that the majority <strong>want</strong> to take it <em>is totally a media creation</em>. See the major reservations so far:</p>
