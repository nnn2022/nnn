    <strong>I know what to thank for all of the insanity</strong>
    <p><p>I personally see all of the panic-insanity as a mere outcome of a greater problem. The plan for the United States hasn’t been carried out correctly, mainly in that the federal government has too much authority as opposed to the states. Each state was supposed to essentially be a nation state, run independently, but without border/trade restrictions or tariffs between states. Literally aside from a national defense, there should be very little that the federal government has authority over, and that in almost all cases, it should be the state government that creates laws, not the federal government. The constitution should’ve essentially stayed the same, perhaps with changes to explicitly ban slavery, and the rest of the interpretation of the law is to be done by the states.</p>
<p>Looking around and other smaller countries (that report by the Dutch CDC, other European reports on asymptomatic case spread being rare, etc) there is so much more integrity in their science, less perverse incentive, less corruption, and most importantly less authority.</p>
<p>God help us all. </p>
<p>If you’re still reading this and are in the US, vote for the Libertarian Party Candidate Jo Jorgensen. She won’t be the next President, but if the libertarian movement can get more visibility and more votes, then in time the corrupt beast that is the US Federal Government can start the healing process and maybe someday we can have an actual libertarian president. None of this pandemic BS would happen if the incentives and authority for corrupt, fearmongering pseudoscience weren’t there altogether.</p></p>

        <p>The CCP is a really powerful entity and serious threat right now that people (not even the most dedicated conspiracy types) never seem to talk about or take seriously enough. Even in this sub or on LockdownSkepticism it seems it's all about things like the Illuminati, secret satanic clubs, or the "deep state". If you ask me the CCP is the actual real culprit/threat behind everything and is one of the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, entities on the planet and most evidence for the source of New Normalism points back to them.</p>
<p>The CCP has been controlling our entertainment and leeching off our economy for years. This is just one more step in their game.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly the collective groupism of “protecting big others” reeks of communism. No ones ever protected me my whole life, I’ve had to claw my way out of an abusive muck of a childhood and fight tooth and nail for everything I’ve ever had. It’s been every man for himself since I was a baby and and now they want <em>me</em> to protect <em>others</em>? The same others who haven’t given a shit about me and who have been competing my with me for jobs and housing and other resources my whole life? Get fucking bent. The earth is woefully overpopulation. I didn’t care when people died in the decades leading up to today and no one cared that I didn’t care. Now the TV tells them to so they do. Why on earth would I want to protect anyone who thinks they have jurisdiction over someone else’s face? Our population needs <em>less</em> people like that, not more!</p>

        <p>I'll definitely be voting Libertarian for Jo Jorgensen! I love her goals of decreasing government power, protecting individual's rights, ending the "war on drugs", and moving towards international neutrality. I'd never support Trump or Biden! Both are senile, corporately-owned, old men with sexual misconduct allegations</p>

        <p>I’m ok voting 3rd party if I believe that between the two main candidates both are equally bad in what would happen with their election. However with the current race, I strongly believe that a Biden/Democrat win will be significantly more damaging then a Trump win. So even if I dislike them both, I’m going to vote for what I think is the best option. Making a statement doesnt do much good if one of the others will win anyway, so unless you believe that you’ll be equally screwed either way, make your vote mean something.</p>
