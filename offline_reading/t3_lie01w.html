        <p>Shocking.</p>
<p>Many people here predicted Biden would force the schools open, and just re-open everything. Sorry to report, that is not going to happen. They're going to make it tougher for kids to go back to school.</p>

        <p>I saw so many anti-lockdown people voting for Biden that somehow believed it would lead to the country opening. I was constantly reminding people that Biden’s own health expert was on tv telling people we had to stay locked down till a vaccine. This was back in April!! Many going to get a shock when this guy keeps masks, distancing and restrictions around forever. If it wasn’t for Governors fighting back his team of doomers would have us locked down in a heartbeat.</p>

        <p>Oh Jesus F Christ. </p>
<p>Yes, I saw many <strong>idiots</strong> on here, and at LDS, claim they voted Biden, because <strong>he</strong> will re-open the country. "This is about getting Trump out of office so if Biden wins, we'll get our freedom back." I facepalmed so much at those comments that my face got a hand print right on it. It's just stupidity. Go ahead and downvote me, people. I don't care. You went and fucked up, and all the people who told me and still tell me that Biden is going to re-open the US are ignorant, useful fools just as much as the people who believe the masks and lockdowns are going to save us.</p>

        <p>Every Dem governor in the country went batshit dictator crazy with covid while red states pushed to reopen. Why in the actual fuck would Biden, whose controlled by the same people that pressured the blue states, and is in league with the fanatics pushing Covid hysteria be different? He also ran on being the one to take covid seriously because Trump let it get out of control. So how exactly do you take covid seriously and how does not that not obviously mean masking and restrictions. I know trump was problematic but People that voted to continue the erosion of our rights and ongoing imprisonments while complaining about inane lockdown restrictions deserve our fury.</p>

        <p>I don't trust either side, but the Democrats have been in most support of the restrictions, so it was foolish of people to believe Biden would somehow re-open, and just "play hero". There's way more going on here than just an election.</p>

        <p>People voted for Biden because he's not Trump. If they were under the illusion Biden would open up schools and businesses, maybe they shouldn't vote anymore.</p>
