    <strong>Ireland is back in level 5 and as much as it pains me to say, I really am not surprised.</strong>
    <p><p>A massive pain in the ass like, fr this shit just seems like a fucking endless circle. Level (1-4) for a bit then back to Level 5, then back to Level (1-4) then back to Level 5. Like seriously, this is so damn annoying and how people are just accepting it and not even seeing any problem with it. Like the vaccine rollout has started here (not taking it, no I’m not ‘anti-vax’) and now the ‘second strain’ or whatever bullshit has too. Like when will it end? The vaccine is ‘99%’ effective, effective at what exactly? Stopping/slowing symptoms, but not actually preventing infection. Like I don’t even know the next time I’ll see my grandparents, whether it will be their funeral or what (I dont even know if I’d be able to attend their funerals.) Like there’s so many people getting absolutely shafted by the governments, people committing suicide, people losing loved ones not being able to see them, people losing their business’/jobs/social lives etc, the economy getting fucked and we were doing so well on a global scale when it came to the ‘eradication of poverty’ and we’re after throwing that out the bloody window. Like the stats are there for anyone to see this virus is not as deadly as the MSM and corrupt government/health officials are making it out to be. And anytime I hear someone say “There will still be mask/social distance after you get vaccinated” literally makes me astonished, it’s like there’s a horde of fucking mindless, ideologically possessed mouthpieces everywhere thinking that the government really want the best for them. They believe everything they hear on the TV/Radio, they are doomed.</p></p>

        <p>The fact that the vaccine doesn’t prevent infection should be a huge red flag to everyone. Basically means that you should only take it if you’re worried about covid killing you, which is like.. elderly and sick people. If I’m injecting this fucked up shit in my veins and I wouldn’t even display symptoms anyways as a person in my 20s, why is the government trying to force me to take it? Out of control.</p>

        <p>The world is heading towards what will be just short of, if not total economic collapse. </p>
<p>There was some “leaked” info from a Canadian Labor Party member who supposedly exposed the planned 2021 events. One of which involves the IMF offering to dissolve all personal debt in exchange for UBI and enrolling in COVID-19 and possibly COVID-21 “mutation” vaccination schedules. Not only this but the supposed “leak” also stated that in exchange for accepting UBI from the IMF, you will forfeit all property and assets, forever. </p>
<p>Only time will tell the alleged “leak” was really a leak or just a fabricated hoax. I have to say though, that everything in the leak is coming to fruition. Here’s to hoping it was just an elaborate hoax.</p>
<p>EDIT: for anyone curious. <a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">Here</a> is an excerpt of the supposed Canadian leak regarding the plans for 2021. Pay very close attention to the events and more importantly the timeline. So far everything is going according to plan...</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s something that planet earth wants to see: the worlds largest and most diverse economy crumble.  The last step, in my mind, is the push for a Universal Basic Income.  UBI, as it is, isn’t the issue.  It’s the fact that the ship has already sailed in this nation, and that goes for universal health care and gun ban outright.  It’s too late in the game.

        <p>It's total shit but to be fair, the last level 5 just before Xmas there were a lot less people giving a fuck about the rules. People are getting sick of this.</p>
<p>I have a friend who works in a nursing home and he's tested every week, not even allowed to go away in Ireland for a break, and he was the most into it of anyone I knew for the whole year, up until last week when he told me they need to fuck off and open everything back up already. Said he will hand in his notice if he's made to take a vaccine.</p>
<p>A couple of others that were putting up with it have been getting fed up lately too.</p>
<p>Go back out and live your life as fully as possible the way things are right now. I'm just doing my thing, if someone confronts me about anything I'll tell them my opinion but I'll leave it at that because chances are you aren't convincing someone who is going out of their way to tell you how you should be living.</p>

        <p>This is happening in a lot of places.</p>
<p>I've heard it postulated that a restaurant could survive short term entirely closed down. But by cycling restrictions you make it unpredictable.</p>
<p>If you want to open when the sun shines, you need to order fresh food. To order fresh food you need to put in a minimum order. So you buy $1500 worth of product in hopes of selling it. But now there's a control on number of patrons at a time. So half of it gets thrown out. You raise prices, lose even more customers. But at least now you're open. Maybe bar seating opens. You need another order because you're just about to break even when...</p>
<p>New restrictions hit. You freeze what you can but the restriction goes on. You need to cut power. But that means risking product.</p>
<p>Up and down up and down they're just fucking with businesses.</p>
<p>Otherwise you could just power down, cancel service for gas, briefly get minimal insurance. But cycling like that means constant adaptation and that's expensive.</p>
<p>tl;dr they just need to make sure they crush <em>all the small businesses</em> before China can take over.</p>
