    <strong>I don't know which is worse, Being generally afraid or knowing it's all BS.</strong>
    <p><p>I've been on both sides of the extremes. I was so far ahead of this thing, that I was actually able to purchase N95 masks in Feb. Leaving the house was such a chore, and the anxiety about catching Covid was exhausting. I thought there was a good chance that I wouldn't be alive by this time.</p>
<p>Now I'm wondering if I'll be alive by this time next year, but for different reasons. Possibly being forced to take the vaccine, or just genocide by the government. It sounds radical, but if you've heard the whistleblower nurses' stories you know that they called the hospitals "death assembly lines". Putting as many people as possible on ventilators to get that government check. </p>
<p>The types of things we are seeing are the telltale signs of a government with too much power. The public now is completely powerless. They can't vote their rulers out, they can barely express themselves online, and now protests are not going to be tolerated without the rulers causing some kind of incident so they can justify more crackdowns.</p>
<p>So which is worse, the fear of the virus, or the fear of government tyranny. I believe the fear of tyranny is a justified one. I think about this a lot. But I guess it's better to not fear the virus so you can take care of yourself better. Knowing that masks can harm you is one thing. If I was scared like I was, I may have been suggestible enough to possibly take the vaccine. So in a way I'm glad I see things more clearly than I once did. But it's lonely not being on the same page as everyone else. It was lonely for me a year ago too when I was the only one worried about the virus.</p></p>

        <p>It really has to be great to believe all of this.</p>
<p>Feeling like a good person just for putting a thing on your face. Signs, media, billboards, and policies all around you to reinforce your thought process.</p>
<p>The ability to talk to any of your friends and family and co workers without worry of getting reported or ostracized because your ideals are totally protected.</p>
<p>For real, imagine being ok with your whole life being shut down because you genuinely believed it was for the greater good instead of losing your lifestyle AND knowing there was nefarious intents on top of it making the load twice as heavy.</p>
<p>It’s like when people argue about 9/11 and say that even if the conspiracy theorists are right they don’t want to believe it because they can’t handle the idea that the government would do such a thing. There are a lot of things that go around like that just because the reality would ruin so many peoples world views it has to stay buried. It’s all about getting through the day in the end.</p>

        <p>It was a huge relief to see credible professionals saying there’s no need to fear. That there is no new deadly virus. </p>
<p>It’s easy to get lost in doom stories. But I am sure there’s a local group near you fighting against this.</p>

        <p>So basically, you're an anxious wreck that jumps to extremes and struggles to rationally approach issues.</p>
<p>Most people aren't really afraid of either.</p>
