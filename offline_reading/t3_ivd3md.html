    <strong>[Ramblings] The speech no Member of Parliament will make.</strong>
    <p><p>I made this out of frustration, anger and a desire to come out as contemplating suicide for the first time in three years to people who might actually care about that instead of mindlessly telling me to wait it out.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with parliamentary procedure, MPs are addressed as “The Right Honourable Lady/Gentleman from [Constituency]”. West Suffolk is Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and Richmond is Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<p><em>”Mr. Speaker, Members of the House,</em></p>
<p><em>I speak on the eve of the greatest upheaval of British democracy since the interregnum. 66,796,806 people are crying tonight, for a terrible plague grips the nation. A plague of anxiety, of nihilism, of cognitive dissonance. A plague that originated not in a Wuhan wet market, but in a brain, in a room, in 10 Downing Street.</em></p>
<p><em>There is a conspiracy theory amongst the opposition that out country’s secret Prime Minister is a tall, dark and handsome stranger from Durham. I disagree, although I share their sentiment that our premiership has been seized by a lone individual within its inner circle. When the infamous Rule of Six was proposed to the government’s Coronavirus Task Force, the Prime Minister and all its members laughed the man who proposed it out of Whitehall. And yet, with no assent from either house of Parliament or Her Majesty the Queen, it became the law. Families torn apart with one aye from 650. As I’m sure the members of the house and the public will know, this “aye” was that of the Right Honourable Gentleman from West Suffolk.</em></p>
<p><em>When this government won a majority in 2019, no one outside of West Sussex voted for a manifesto with this man.’s face on it, and nobody in West Sussex voted for a manifesto </em>because<em> it had his face on it. And yet, the Right Honourable Gentleman has, through foreign agents, couped this government. Need I remind you that we are being asked to trust with our lives with the man who used the COVID crisis to cull the working class by turning people away from empty NHS hospitals and clinics? We are being asked to trust with our lives the man who exacerbated an existing PPE shortage by ordering defective products from Turkey and the People’s Republic. We are being asked to trust with our lives this man, who will force us through his COVID mashalls to return to the house arrest we worked so hard to break from. The Right Honourable Gentleman from Richmond has done a better job of safeguarding the health of our citizens and our NHS, and it was never his sworn duty to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>The science is settled. COVID-19 has followed its forefather SARS in becoming less lethal as time has progressed. Hospitalisations and deaths are lower than they have been since the crisis began in February. We are halfway to our all time peak in cases, and yet dementia, cerebralvascular disease and flu are all bigger killers per day than COVID-19. Do we lock down society for them? Will there be a further lockdown from the suicides, eating disorders, liver poisoning, malnourishment, domestic violence and neglect for treatable illnesses that will result from this recklessness? Why will the government not guarantee a majority for thirty years by marking a national holiday for a country that sacrificed everything to beat a deadliest viral threat in a century together? In the words the young boy at the Krusty Burger, and of everyone in our country tonight: “Stop, it’s already dead.”</em></p>
<p><em>66,796,806 people, 649 of them in this very house, are reading the same graphs as the Right Honourable Gentleman from West Suffolk and coming to a different conclusion. Ochlocracy may be flawed, but it seems that every horse on the racetrack is jumping the right fences except for My Little Matty. He is the only outlier, and he has couped this government with the backing of the World Health Organisation, which every member of this house knows to be a puppet of the People’s Republic. I encourage both his party and the people of West Suffolk to petition a Vote of No Confidence and end this man’s stranglehold on our democracy and our civil rights</em></p></p>
