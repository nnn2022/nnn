    <strong>When do you think the tide will start turning?</strong>
    <p><p>When the average person realises they wasted so much precious time they can't get back and that Cough-19 only kills those who are basically dead anyway?</p>
<p>I live in Ireland and as a whole we are very compliant but it's nice to see that it seems like fewer people are wearing masks on the streets, wearing them incorrectly and just generally it seems like everyone is fatigued and doesn't really give a fuck if they catch it or not. You just can't tell me that if this was Ebola and if it was as contagious as COVID, this would still be the case. People wouldn't have to be reminded 24/7 that they're in a LITERAL GLOBAL PANDEMIC LITERALLY. We'd know that.</p>
<p>The current plan in my country is to open gastropubs by the end of MAY, they'll obviously have a bunch of stupid restrictions and really it won't be much different from last summer.</p>
<p>I really don't see people being okay with it. Right now it's winter so people are staying inside anyway, but if they get told that they'll have to miss out on another vacation, after more than a year of infections, 6 months of vaccinations and barely any deaths, I hope to God that there will be riots.</p>
<p>Right? Enough old people will be vaccinated by then for the average person to realise this isn't because of a mild virus. Or am I being too hopeful?</p></p>

        <p>Hopefully it will turn when anal swabs start becoming a thing in the US. They’re starting to do it in China now.</p>

        <p>The anal swabs are really stupid. Stupider than having to shove a swab up your nose and touch your brain case to get enough viral RNA to 'test'.</p>
<p>If this fucking virus is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO damned contagious, I should be able to spit on a swab and they will get enough viral RNA to test or they should be able to swab my mouth and get enough viral RNA to test.</p>
