        <p>Ok, well how about this - </p>
<p>My mother-in-law passed away a month ago from cardiac arrest in her home; she had suffered from a heart condition for years, and a month prior to her death she had been experiencing a myriad of severe symptoms of a looming heart attack  (fainting, weakness, etc).</p>
<p>Although my father-in-law tried desperately to get her to go to the hospital during that prior month, she continuously and steadfastly refused - even as her condition worsened - because she was extremely fearful of "getting" corona virus at the hospital.  </p>
<p>This is a sad, tragic story - hers was an avoidable death that was <em>legitimately and literally</em> caused by the rampant fear and propaganda surrounding the misinformation about the "pandemic".</p>

        <p>I absolutely and I know several accounts of that honestly and even more so now of the mindset that "If I go into the hospital now, I'm a goner" because of how greedy for money they are to get someone on a ventilator etc</p>

        <p>We had a very difficult conversation in our house about what we are going to do if something happens to us that we need medical care. The consensus, I'd rather die in my bed with my family, then go to a hospital and be cut off from all protection and advocacy and let the doctors do what they may, while alone.</p>

        <p>Thank you for that, the sentiment is much appreciated.  I actually felt a little bit weird about relating the story here, but after seeing the upvotes, I'm really glad I did;  I feel like it's really important for people to hear this story (and others too, like the o.p.' s).</p>
<p>I mean, this is the reality of this nonsense, things like this are literally happening.  </p>
<p>I'm glad that a little bit of good can come out of telling her tragic story.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I appreciate that - it affected my wife and father-in-law much more than it did me, but it is just so was stupid and tragic.  </p>
<p>The world has gone completely crazy - I am 57 yrs old, and I have not seen anything like this in all those years; we really need to keep up the good fight and continue talking about things like this so more people are enlightened by anecdotal information, rather than just the msm.</p>

        <p>Im so sorry to hear that. My husband just had a bunch of bad seizures last night. We were told we should not take him to the hospital because of Covid. He’s a healthy man in his 30s other than the epilepsy. This scaring everyone away from hospitals is causing half the damn excess deaths. Ridiculous times we live in</p>

        <p>This isn't even as close to being as bad, but I put up with an ear infection because I thought they might think I had COVID if I went to the doctor's, and shove a swab up my nose. I put up with it for three months. I had no other symptoms of sickness other than sore and plugged ears, which I've had on a regular basis since childhood.</p>

        <p>What I don't get is that doctors are generally pretty smart and should be able to see through all this shit, but the only doctors I know that see this whole thing as a moronic exercise are republicans. That should tell you something right there. There is absolutely no reason for someone's political opinions to affect their opinion of a goddam disease. It points to the whole thing being a massive psyop/scam/bioweapon or who the fuck knows what. All I know is I smell shit</p>

        <p>I've been noticing a lot of sloppiness in the medical community lately. Haven't been to the ER, but I am going to a lot of specialists, and they just don't seem to give me much care or good bedside. Maybe because I am not allowed to bring a companion? For real, they've been rude, lazy, lack empathy, and so on. One doctor I saw gave me a really rough physical exam, and it disturbed me, probably because he didn't have to deal with someone being in the room with me, which I usually have.</p>

        <p>I noticed this too when my daughter finally got her surgery after being delayed for several months. The nurses were cold, the room going back could have been cleaner. When I was taking her home she was incredible upset from the anesthesia. While I was trying to carry her, and find the exit, I dropped my bag, and her stuffed animal. The four nurses walking past me just looked at me and carried on instead of stopping to help me.</p>

<p>In Canada we had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplessis_Orphans">Duplessis Orphans</a>.  Where Doctors and the Catholic Church with the Government Conspired to misdiagnose Orphan Children as Mentally Ill to get more Government Money.  These children were abused Physically, Mentally and Sexually.  They were SOLD(adopted) to families.  They were SEX TRAFFICKED.</p>
<p>There used to be a Gay Brothel in Montreal Canada that was frequented by Politicians that had some of the Boys come through to service the Elite.  </p>
<p>If there is money involved some one is lying to get more of it.</p>

        <p>My grandfather got it the week of thanksgiving, mid 70s and very overweight. He lost 20 pounds, didn’t eat for days, had covid pneumonia, and could barely walk. Guess what. Hospital turned him away because he wasn’t a bad enough case and were worried about people “in worse condition”. In the state of Georgia, hospitals are quite literally turning you away (even in the so called “high risk category”) for people they slap on a ventilator and wait to die so they can get money. Thankfully he got through it and is healthy now.</p>
<p>Edit: he got turned away twice, the second time an ambulance took him.</p>

<p>If you come in an ambulance, that is an automatic sign that you need medical treatment NOW... not days or even hours later.</p>

        <p>I work for hospice and see this ALL THE TIME in the medical records- “patient has XYZ symptoms, covid negative but assumed positive.” And their chief complaint/cause of death is covid, despite “other” medical issues are dementia, cancer, being 90 etc. It’s absolutely ridiculous</p>

        <p>So, let me get this straight .. you truly believe that doctors &amp; nurses across our entire nation are willing to put their reputations, licenses and their jobs on the line to commit illegal acts to .. what end?   What gain?  Help a hospital get more money?  They would be guilty of committing fraud ... thousands of docs &amp; nurses are going to risk it all for what?   </p>
<p>To Hurt Trump?  Is that what you truly believe?   Wouldn’t the other docs n nurses who are Trump supporters rising up &amp; screaming from the rafters look look my hospital is trying to hurt Trump by lying about numbers &amp; filing police reports or walking out since they know their fellow doctors &amp; nurses are committing mass fraud across the nation?  It’s not happening because it’s propaganda.</p>
<p>If anyone truly believes something this insane ... you need professional help.</p>
<p>Q said 160,000 subpoenas have been sealed across the nation to indict pedos .. 160,000 of them ... if it were true, hundreds &amp; hundreds of people would be involved in the preparation of said subpoenas &amp; the signatures of so many would be needed but not a peep outta anybody that’s actually typed one up anywhere to be found.  It’s propaganda ... </p>
<p>Jesus christ people .. you cannot be this stupid .. </p>
<p>Here are just some of the insane crap im hearing from .. adults .. i mean seriously </p>
<p>Doctors &amp; nurses are lying to help hospitals for ... (fill in the blank)</p>
<p>Hillary gets blood transfusions from newborn babies in basements</p>
<p>160,000 subpoenas for pedo democrats are prepared blah blah .. that was 9 months ago i heard this .. (why wait?  Babies and children are being molested &amp; they’ve not served the prepared subpoenas yet?  Wut?  Why not?  I mean you’ve got republicans in charge &amp; yet they’ve not served these 160,000 subpoenas </p>
<p>JFK Jr is not dead?  Come on Q ... produce him .. i love that guy .. where’s he at?  </p>
<p>Please people .. my friends who are Republican nurses &amp; doctors along with my Democrat nurses &amp; doctors are not going to lie &amp; commit fraud for any damn reason.  They are exhausted from the work .. the stress .. the pain of watching patients dying in record numbers.  </p>
<p>Wear your masks for them.  Social distance for them.  if you’ve got a brain, it shouldn’t be that big of an ask that your behaviors contribute to the problem if you don’t... hopefully you help save lives by participating in the process of eradicating a global pandemic.</p>

<p>It is a "There is nothing else that we know of currently that can do this to the heart of a healthy man, so we are going to assume it is because of CoVid-19!"</p>
