<title>The excess hunger deaths this year will likely surpass the total deaths from covid globally. Were not saving lives, we're exchanging them. Every year 3 million children die from malnutrition and we are forcing hundreds of millions into poverty.</title>

    <strong>The excess hunger deaths this year will likely surpass the total deaths from covid globally. Were not saving lives, we're exchanging them. Every year 3 million children die from malnutrition and we are forcing hundreds of millions into poverty.</strong>
    <p><p>It's just strange to me not only how we've ignored mass casualty on a grand scale for the entirety of our lifetimes, (over 200 million starved to death since I've been born and 2.6 million upper respiratory deaths in 2019 alone) but also how we are creating a mass casualty event with an attempt to prevent one. </p>
<p>The idea of lockdowns lies within the logic that that we are saving a significant amount of lives and that the net positive drastically outweighs the net negative. I'm not at all convinced that lockdowns are making any significant difference in per capita death rates compared to the massive issue we caused globally. </p>

        <p>No, not really. It's a big number, I'll grant you that, but it still doesn't even come close. And if you want to be precise, in most cases that's not too much food, but rather wrong kind of food that kills people</p>

        <p>Yeah, but compare it to 22,000 children dying every day as a result of extreme poverty according to the UNICEF (and that's before the pandemic). That's over 8 million annually.</p>
