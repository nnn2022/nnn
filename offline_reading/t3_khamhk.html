    <p><p>They are laughing at us. Whether or not they released this virus intentionally, they are absolutely taking the piss and probably did not expect this to work as well as it did. While they are busy claiming islands and land in the east and claiming land on the moon, we've been fucking around for the past 9 months taking orders from the Chinese controlled WHO! You can't make this shit up. Reality is truly stranger than fiction.</p></p>
