    <strong>Mene, Mene,Tekel, Parsin</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; 5 Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote. 6 His face turned pale and he was so frightened that his legs became weak and his knees were knocking.</p>
<p>&rt; You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. 24 Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription.</p>
<p>&rt; 25 “This is the inscription that was written: mene, mene, tekel, parsin</p>
<p>&rt; 26 “Here is what these words mean:</p>
<p>&rt; Mene : God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end.</p>
<p>&rt; Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.</p>
<p>&rt; Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.”</p>
<p><strong>God will reward the righteous and punish the wicked in the end.</strong></p></p>
