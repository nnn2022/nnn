        <p>I'd like to see one compelling example of this.  I can give numerous in which this is not the case.  I also don't consider vigorous debate a shortcoming in individuals as long as it is done in good faith.</p>

        <p>I also had a hard time wrapping my head around the concept. Perhaps it's like if you have a lot of Karen's in your Florida retirement community they keep everybody in check and it keeps any one person from being too disruptive.
However in the case of a bad idea that a small group wants to do, the larger group just holds the ground and says no we're not going to do this.</p>

        <p>I dont see how legitimate short comings in people lead to a better world.  Say for example robberies and killings etc lead to police and better security overall.  People start watching their kids more to make sure they are safe and all the other usual rational reactions you would expect to occur from crime.  Imagine now if as a result of all these precautions there was never a murder or robbery again.  Is the world a better place?  Yes.  But not because of the criminals.  In spite of them.  The world is only better because their legitimate shortcomings are no longer a problem.  Which means the world would have been better off had those shortcomings not manifested themselves in the first place.  Just my take.</p>

        <p>Your response mentions more police and possible crime. It's interesting that now so many people are in pandemic relief, essentially UBI, we have the possibility to instead have some kind of sharing or cooperating, acknowledge our plenty and get rid of unnecessary scarcity mindset. Perhaps something like this essay[Thought experiment â€” Summer Camp for All rather than Universal Basic Income</p>

        <p>I dont think you addressed my point.  If you did, I'm sorry but it flew over my head.  UBI is a different conversation entirely.</p>

        <p>Just hopefully whatever new system evolves won't need so much policing. I guess I was saying if everyone has free housing and monthly money then there won't be the haves and have-nots, which ends up with lots of police and people unhappy</p>
