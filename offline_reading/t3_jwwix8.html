        <p>This has to be geographical. I read these stories and it's a complete reversal of where I live. </p>
<p>The kids here hate the masks, they openly mock them in school, and they all think Joe Biden is a hair sniffer who can't talk. I have two children, one freshman and one third grader, both of their schools voted for Trump in their "elections". </p>
<p>While I do hear some of the kids talk about liking the masks it's few and far between. </p>
<p>Both my children completely understand the real concepts behind the mask wearing, and remove them every chance they get.</p>

        <p>Listen, you’re in school, which means you’re a kid.  Most of the things you’re describing is because kids are kind of stupid.   If it wasn’t masks, they’d be acting the exact same way about another topic.   Don’t worry, some of them might not be so stupid when they grow up and get a mortgage and family to support.</p>

        <p>Yeah most people stay stupid even after they turn 18. I've always said that adults are just big children.</p>

        <p>Don't worry i feel the same way, I'm in a fully compliant state myself and every time I'm still confused at the mindsets fueling this fire. They will say anything to justify what simply can not be justified by any of this. Most of the people calling other people selfish are the most selfish people in the world. You can't buy the mainstream narrative without also consuming mindlessly the other poison fruits spawned from the tree it's growing from, it would be easier to see if they were aware of the extent of their hedonism since this would feel more like a gaslighting celebration of it they spout with a smirk but they don't even seem capable of that. The mainstream media, the health/beauty products, the trash it calls food, the suicidal education systems, the wireless smart grid they are glad they have no escape from and no desire to. Never in my entire life has mass conformity been so dangerous to its essence.</p>

        <p>Don't worry friend. Ride this wave. It will peak soon if it hasn't already. Once it all crashes down things will go back to "normal". That or we'll have a small civil war lol. But I don't think America would ever seriously have a civil war again. Just be patient. Every action will have a reaction. The swing to the left will be equivalent of the swing to the right.</p>
