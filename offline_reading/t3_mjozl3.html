        <p>As someone who spent the better part of 2 decades well ahead of their peers on reality, I can tell you it only brings you pain and loss of relationships if you try to "wake people up." Don't bother unless they come to you, even then, baby steps. It's a lot of stress, misery, despair, and pain to know the truths of this world. Some people aren't equiped for it, and so they will fight you trying to break their programming. Hell most days I wish I could go back and take the bluepill.</p>

        <p>Yeah just tell who is safe, or feed a little baby food in, that's about all you can do. Most don't want to know. They will hate you for telling the truth. I have faced ostracization in too many places. I speak out a little bit, and that has been enough to not be "accepted".</p>

        <p>I feel you here. It always felt like I was living in a different reality, but the last several months have exacerbated the feeling. I’m also in a blue area that follows science like a religion (which it has become for most). Tough to find likeminded people that think for themselves. My lease ends in a few months and I work remotely so I’ll be moving this year to greener pastures.</p>

        <p>I want to add a caveat based on my own experiences. When I try to "red pill" people on social media, it almost always backfires. I have even lost friends doing it.</p>
<p>However, it always ends up differently when I talk to people in person. Especially in one-on-one situations. They are far more receptive because they are released from the performative demands of social media. Don't forget organizing 101--be polite, don't preach, let them come to the conclusions on their own.</p>
<p>One last thing. You shouldn't be *shy* on social media even if it isn't the best way to change people's minds. I post things everyday that normies find offensive. It isn't for illumination, but for support---to support the people who kinda think like we do. If they don't occasionally see opposition, we lose them too.</p>

        <p>What I do is I don’t try to convince anyone; I just lead by example.  That’s way more effective anyway.  Not wearing the mask, going out, not social distancing, not participating in conversations about how scary the variants are; etc.; really just not even talking about covid at all and just being normal and doing shit.  If it does come up I’ll drop a very light unobjectionable red pill like “I hate how the masks stop you from seeing smiles and dehumanize people.”  Little things.  We don’t need to be missionaries and persuade people; just let your light inspire one person here; another there.</p>

        <p><strong>Can’t convince them directly, but maybe indirectly with guerrilla tactics.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone on this sub could make 100 calls to restaurants and businesses to ask a reasonable question (do you have dine in service? Do you have product x in stock?).  These could be businesses 500 miles from where you live.  Then say, “Oh, do I have to wear a mask to enter your shop?” followed by, “Oh, we’re still doing the pretend pandemic?”  If the person gets offended, then say you’re just kidding.  Probably they will laugh in agreement.  People need to think that others are questioning the pandemic also- it gets them out of their shell.  They already know it is nonsense deep down, they just don’t realize it yet.</p>

        <p>Very true; everybody today is faced with what the media tells you covid is, and then the walking contradiction to that story which is our personal real lives.</p>
<p>For this reason, every last doomer or person in between still has at least some degree of cognitive dissonance about covid.  After having this for over a year now, It may not take much; say one more irrational lockdown, followed by one person pointing it out; to tip them over to sanity/reality.  </p>
<p>I know a big moment just happened with my brother in BC Canada, After a year of him putting up with it and just kind of going “ahh well i guess it’s a pandemic and it’s just how it is”, </p>
<p>when they suddenly announced restaurants would be shut down <em>again</em> from
Indoor dining,</p>
<p>Bro came out and said “this is starting to look like this whole thing was planned to take out small businesses.”  Couldn’t believe he said that; I thought that was awesome lol.  I had thought that by this point if you hadn’t woken up; you never would, but I’m seeing now that lots of people do have a tipping point; there’s is just after an insanely long period of “patience”, or whatever you call it.</p>

        <p>This kind of defeatism works against us. We need some of the masses just for the numbers, even if you don't actually care about them as fellow humans. Plant a seed here and there, wherever you can. The more of the masses who are awakening, the less of a chance the totalitarians have.</p>

        <p>Don’t hate people or get mad at them for being afraid. Anger and hate only adds to fear, they can never defeat it. If you’ve overcome fear then I’m truly grateful for you but that doesn’t put you above those who haven’t overcome their fears yet. The world is scary and they end up suffering most from their fear complexes. Create as many on-ramps to the truth and freedom for them as possible or you will lose.</p>

        <p>You think that this is a conspiracy and I don’t. That’s not because I’m brainwashed, it’s because it not being a conspiracy is the most logical answer. </p>
<p>Let’s apply Occam's razor to this situation. If you don’t know, Occam's razor states that “entities should not be multiplied without necessity”. Basically, it states that the simplest answer is almost always the right one. </p>
<p>Now, what’s the simplest answer here? </p>
<p>1) COVID is a massive conspiracy that have every nation on earth, including ones that don’t like each other (ie: Russia, China, and America), and it’s lead by a currently unknown group with unknown motives. The existence of said unknown group has no evidence of even existing.</p>
<p>2) COVID is a virus. It moves from person to person and can kill people, just like other viruses can. COVID rates increasing is a result of people not wearing masks and not socially distancing, something which has been proven to work. Conflicting information about COVID is a result of little being known about it, as it is a relatively new virus. People get hostile over this because others have died, not because they’re brainwashed.</p>
<p>If you say that 1 is more reasonable than 2, please re-read Occam’s razor. I would also like to point you to a quote from the second volume of Mark Twain’s autobiography:
“How easy it is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo that work again!”</p>

        <p>What evidence? All I’ve seen for evidence is statements from unqualified people, unsupported conclusions, misquoted statements, and misused data. I’ve seen no evidence that it’s about money. I really don’t know know what your talking about when you say “abusive measures”. </p>
<p>Do you mean asking you to wear a mask? Or are you talking about the vaccine? Because there really isn’t all that much evidence that it’s dangerous or anything other than helpful in making things go back to the old normal. That’s what you guys want, right?</p>

        <p>You still didn’t provide any evidence, only saying “look around”. I have looked around. I haven’t seen anyone putting actual evidence that has not been disproven. Be honest with yourself, you’re the one who’s not looking around and seeing all the evidence that covid is real and dangerous. You seem to think that the government is out to get us and harm us. They aren’t. If you think about it logically, that doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.</p>
