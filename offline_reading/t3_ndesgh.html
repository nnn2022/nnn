    <strong>My Job And Mask Requirements</strong>
    <p><p>So my job stated today that employees no longer have to wear masks if they are fully vaccinated. I've been telling my employer since day one I hate the masks, covid is bullshit, and I'm never getting the vaccine. All of my coworkers have been vaccinated besides me and I wasnt wearing a mask today like everyone else. </p>
<p>I know some time soon, my boss is going to catch me not wearing one and report me to corporate. I'm thinking corporate will come and ask me to prove if I am vaccinated. If I tell them it's none of their business, I'm thinking they will make me wear a mask or fire me if I refuse to wear one or show proof of vaccination. </p>
<p>Do I have any legal recourse? Apparently jobs can ask you if you've been vaccinated and ask for proof. They're also not allowed to fire someone unless they offer an alternative to being unvaccinated, such as requiring you to wear a mask to protect other employees</p></p>

        <p>I'm sitting tight and waiting to see what OSHA says about this. Mandatory vaccine = employers are on the hook for damages if an employee is hurt by the vaccine. Voluntary vaccine = employer doesn't have to pay. <em>However</em>, if they take adverse action against an employee for not getting the experimental shot, even if they don't actually fire them, that's enough to flip it from voluntary to required for OSHA reporting and liability purposes.</p>
<p>So if they give you bad assignments, bar you from promotions, etc. that's "required" and they're liable. Forced masking <em>probably</em> doesn't qualify, but it's not clear, especially in states that don't have a mask mandate at all. Like it's perfectly legal for me to work without a mask, and making me wear one was a unilateral decision from the employer. If they lift the rule for vaccinated employees, but refuse for unvaccinated (even if immune and can show proof! wtf), that's differential treatment at least. So I'm curious about what forced masking of only unvaccinated employees means for employers' liability under OSHA guidelines.</p>

        <p>If you work in an office:  why would they care if the single unvaccinated person is maskless?  Why would the vaccinated care, aren’t they protected?</p>
<p>If you work with customers in person:  are they going to force unvaccinated clients to wear masks?</p>
<p>While you look for another job, continue to wear your mask, but get more and more lax about wearing it properly.  Soon nobody will care</p>

        <p>This is 100% unhelpful. Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but,</p>
<p>Like it or not, vaccination is not a protected class. Your employers ability to ask and mandate varies greatly from state to state. Asking for proof is a grey line in many states, but again this will depend on where u are and the local laws. If you are in a rights to work state then your employer can pretty much mandate what they want. It’s easy to let emotion play into the feeling of “unfair”, but the truth is that in more states than not your employer can ask about status and drive repercussions for your actions, or lack there of. So depending on where you work, your boss “catching you” could lead to swift termination or prolonged termination after multiple “catching” events. </p>
<p>Again, no offense, but that’s how the law works...</p>

        <p>EUAs are clear: Getting these vaccines is voluntary</p>
<p>The same section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that authorizes the FDA to grant emergency use authorization also requires the secretary of Health and Human Services to “ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product.”</p>
<p>Likewise, the FDA’s guidance on emergency use authorization of medical products requires the FDA to “ensure that recipients are informed to the extent practicable given the applicable circumstances … That they have the option to accept or refuse the EUA product …”</p>
<p>In the same vein, when Dr. Amanda Cohn, the executive secretary of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, was asked if Covid-19 vaccination can be required, she responded that under an EUA, “vaccines are not allowed to be mandatory. So, early in this vaccination phase, individuals will have to be consented and they won’t be able to be mandatory.” Cohn later affirmed that this prohibition on requiring the vaccines applies to organizations, including hospitals.</p>

        <p>OP, are you an immunologist, virologist, zoologist, epidemiologist, medical doctor, or at least a nurse?</p>
<p>Chances are, to be this ignorant, you either work in a no-name office or work in the trades.  In both cases, you don't respect people who are experts in their fields, and instead prefer to get your accurate information from Facebook.</p>
<p>Should you get sick, would you want the nurses and doctors to refuse you treatment?  If so, feel free to say so now.  There have been thousands of patients--sick with covid--getting hooked up to ventilators while they say "well how can this be? The virus isn't even real?!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile doctors and nurses have to put up with your idiotic thought process amd ignorance, but still treat you even though you are doing everything in your power not to deserve it.</p>
<p>PS did you spend your stimulus checks?  I am just curious how deep your hypocrisy goes.</p>
