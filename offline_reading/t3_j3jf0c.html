    <strong>Missing work because I got tested and have to stay home until I get a call or email.</strong>
    <p><p>My boyfriend likely just caught a cold and only has coughing as a symptom. It's been almost 2 weeks since he had this cough and I am not sick at all and haven't been feeling sick since he started. We took the precaution to take the test, also my boss that day sent out an email to let him know if something like this is up so that's another reason to get tested. </p>
<p>I got a paper as proof to my employer and it's ok at work so far it's not busy. However I've been anticipating and checking my email every 20 minutes for the past 55 hours or something and I only went outside to take the trash and I hate this so much, this is not a day off of work to me, yes I sat home cooked and watched YouTube videos but I am not free to walk outside because I could get fined. I guess I fell into the fear mongering trap anyways. I feel like 8
If I am positive and they call to ask where I've been and find out I didn't go straight home after my test I'm gonna get a hefty fine or go to jail for going to the mall and ordering take out.</p>
<p>They said it can take 24 to 48 hours usually for the test results up until 5 days.</p>
<p>If I am negative, I lost half my work week, I owe my coworkers their hours back and I just faced days of absolute boredom and frustration.</p>
<p>If I don't get any word by the 72 hour mark after my test I'm fucking calling because I want to go back to work!!!!</p></p>

        <p>A friend of mine had "exposure to a positive person" at work (middle school).  He had to get a test.  Test came back negative.  The school district still required him to quarantine for 2 weeks despite the negative test.....makes no goddamn sense.</p>

        <p>The "must have negative COVID test to work" thing is such bullshit. Even if coronavirus was actually a big deal, that whole policy makes no goddamn sense</p>
<p>For one, doesn't testing negative simply mean you've never had it? Who's to say you can't get it between the time you get tested and go back to work? Or what if you get it while working? Wouldn't it make more sense to want a positive test so you at least know you have developed immunity?</p>

        <p>This is why you don't get a test, unless you really, genuinely sick.</p>
<p>The people telling you to stay home don't give a shit if you have support, food in the cupboard, or any cash or credit reserve to get you through.</p>
<p>To them, you are literally a number - an egg that got broken making their panic omelette.</p>
<p>Plus you are now on a contact tracking database somewhere - count on it.</p>
