    <strong>I just witnessed an awakening and it was beautiful</strong>
    <p><p>I have been feeling so hopeless over the last few days. I live in the people’s republic of new York  and I am vastly outnumbered by people who think I’m a murdering trump supporter because I don’t want the vaccine for myself and I go for walks unmasked. I really feel like nyc is the biggest disappointment on earth , our protests are pathetic . Low turn outs compared to other cities and you would think the vaccine passport here would wake people the hell up but nope. Not only are they sleeping, they adore our perverted dear leader Cuomo. Its a COVID cult. It’s just awful. </p>
<p>Anyway here’s the surprise....I am a chick and I have been going to a hairdresser for the past few years who is the stereotypical nyc liberal. I remember her posting BLM stuff last summer , she was into the whole movement just to paint a picture of who she is. She has a good heart and does care about people. Very sjw conscious going with the movement and the crowd, the vast majority of which are now proudly getting the vaccine and wearing double masks and wishing people like me dead because I don’t agree with them. </p>
<p>Tonight I was checking Instagram and her stories popped up in my feed. She was talking about her policies and how she won’t be asking anyone about their vaccination status and she is not going to be answering any questions about her own status and neither are her staff. She stated that she has equal respect for people who have chosen to be the control group as she does for people who have taken the experiment and are proud of it. Then she started talking about how hard this year was and she mentioned freedom and constitutional rights. I was shocked. This woman is the absolute last person I would expect this from. I also noticed she is now following prageru. </p>
<p>This is not about politics for me , it’s about watching someone change their views and not be afraid to stand strong. When I was a liberal dem here years ago a Prageru video got to me too. It made sense and when it was over I remember thinking wait a minute. I thought this was supposed to be bigoted and racist? It made me start thinking, if I was wrong about that, what else was I wrong about?Yes I was that closed minded back then. I am now no party and I will never lay claim to any political party ever again. </p>
<p>I was left feeling hope. If a person I would never expect to be thinking like this is waking up others must be too. I am guessing a year of being jerked around and having her livelihood taken away from her by the government played a part in this awakening. She is also really into her health, exercise and eating healthy and vitamins etc. I’m guessing being pressured to have an experimental vaccine probably horrified her.</p>
<p>This also confirms for me that the last people who will be die hard pro lockdown, pro mask, pro vaccine pro passport are the people whose lives were barely affected by this. They didn’t lose income, they didn’t have to commute, they got to stay home and they were never that social to begin with. They don’t want this to end and they will kick and scream at the rest of us who want our lives back now. They actually have more to lose going back to normal.</p>
<p>I am hopeful that more people are finally starting to realize there is much more to this than a virus. That caring about nothing but Covid has resulted in unparalleled destruction that will take years to rebuild.  Also...Our government doesn’t give a shit about us and if you think they do you need to think again. The only one who cares about you is you, and if you’re lucky people close to you who love you.</p></p>

        <p>It just gave me hope, at this point I'm pretty desperate for it. The slightest little thing picks me up a tiny bit. I'm in a very dark place right now, New York and California are the most awful places. It makes me sad because I always loved my state but now all I think about is leaving. I'm really hoping that more people will start snapping out of this. It seems like people have been under a spell for over a year now.</p>

        <p>I left in 2014, moved around the country about 6 times for work in a short time frame and ended up in Texas and I love it.</p>

        <p>So happy for you that you got out! I've been in Texas and I really liked it I just couldn't deal with the weather though. I love snow and I love cold, if I could live anywhere in New York state I would pick the Adirondacks where I lived growing up. I have to get out of this city it's crazy. Other places in the state are beautiful and very nice places to live. The city is a hellhole and I don't think it's ever coming back. I really wish I liked hot weather because if I did I would go down South for sure oh, I would absolutely love to visit Nashville.</p>

        <p>I am around people who love them and will tell you they want to keep wearing them. I have been told by insane women that they like them so they don't have to do their makeup. Here in nyc i have been told to put a mask on while walking on the street with no one close to me by people across the street. I don't know where you are but people here love this shit and don't want it to end. Many have masks to match their outfits and see it as a fashion accessory.</p>
