        <p>I wish everyone would just catch it and be over it by Halloween. I’d volunteer to go first but I think I had it in February. </p>
<p>Slowing the virus down makes zero sense now that we know the death rate is extremely low. Sprinters and Endurance runners both reach the finish line. Endurance running just takes longer.</p>

        <p>It makes perfect sense when you accept that none of this was about saving people from a virus. </p>
<p>While I agree with OPs sentiment, I want to add that I don't get colds. I'm not trying to show off, I just think it's worth sharing.</p>
<p>I work out a lot. I don't particularly eat healthily but I make sure to eat some fruit and veg everyday (I normally get some kind of Mcdonalds or chicken burger as a meal in a day). </p>
<p>I don't get ill in general. I NEVER worry about sanitisation and have never touched that hand gel stuff and will happily eat food off public tables or stuff that fell on the floor. I make sure when the sun is out that I get some of it on my face. However most the time I am sat indoors in front of a computer. </p>
<p>Cold's and flu aren't even innevitable if we just did the basic looking after ourselves.</p>
<p>If we all did the bare minimum looking after ourselves we would have never been able to be manipulated so hard this year. </p>
<p>Exercise people.</p>

        <p>Lol I’ve talked to so many people who said they had it in feb. </p>
<p>I could have as well but I honestly think it was just a bad cold. But you really can’t tell the difference so who the heck knows.</p>

        <p>To be fair, the rona IS pretty much just a bad cold....I think I had it back in February, simply because I've never had such a <em>dry</em> cold or flu in my life. Woke up with a cough, thought it was just my occasional morning allergy/pollution cough, mother-in-law asked if I had a cold, I angrily said no because my husband and I don't like her meddling with our health or safety, then I was shaking and feverish by bedtime. Fever lasted a few days, dry cough persisted for a week or so, thought maybe I had pneumonia because my chest hurt from coughing and my lungs felt like I was drowning. No sinus symptoms whatsoever. Never had a cold or flu quite like that, totally fine now though. Aside from, y'know, the state of the world.</p>
<p>If it was the rona....3/10, would not recommend. Not worth masking up or locking down though.</p>

        <p>Had the same around February in an area they later found had cases as early as January.</p>
<p>Mine lasted several weeks but also the worst sore throat I've ever experienced. Assumed strep but looked at my throat and it was just reddish but not streppy. No fever. The cough lasted forever and I remember being on the phone with people and just coughing my lungs out and us joking I definitely had the 'rona.</p>
<p>Followed by one household member with never getting sick, the other a mild cold for a few days (both kids) and the other adult getting a stomach bug. </p>
<p>All different reactions to a virus I obviously brought home, and let me tell you as a family of 4 stomach bugs don't just hit one person but it did this time for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Actually Covid ? No idea. And I don't actually care. </p>
<p>Both adults say 6/10 do not recommend, kids were not even really bothered.</p>
<p>Lockdown and masks and collapse the world ? No dude. I've been way sicker.</p>
<p>That cough though did suck.</p>

        <p>Yes, I (almost certainly) had it in March....went away completely in 1 month. Only a couple days fever or so... a few days of harder breathing. Lingering cough for other weeks.  Mostly gone in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoLockdownsNoMasks/?f=flair_name%3A%22Long%20COVID%22</p>
<p>But worth learning about others....</p>
<p>Now, I might have caught another strain on a recent trip - Las Vegas. The G strain. Feb infections were D strain mostly - original. There's also the V483A strain...which is just emerging.</p>
<p>I have none of the listed symptoms except a burning feeling in my mouth, and on/off again irritation in my throat. Do I know I have it, no, it could be something else. But to be sick in Sep is very unusual.</p>
<p>Guessing my body mostly knows how to deal with it...but needs some extra time perhaps? But I can't confirm any of this, and I don't want to have a nasal swab.</p>

        <p>Same. I thought I was just regular sick. I was working at a gem &amp; mineral show, which is the largest on the planet and brings tens of thousands of people from every corner of the globe. </p>
<p>I remember being scared shitless when I went to urgent care, and the doctor and nurse I saw were in head to toe full garb. I was thinking “omg am I that sick? Does someone else here have ebola or something? What is going on?” 
But corona wasn’t really a thing here quite yet. </p>
<p>I still dont know if it was or wasn’t. I haven’t gotta an antibody test, but I am kinda curious</p>

<p>Edit: Middle aged people are also at risk, and they’re kinda backbone of the economy. Furthermore, a rather significant percentage of people who get sick and recover are left with some kind of permanent damage. (e.g. reduced lung capacity, brain damage, etc.)</p>

        <p>That's not what I intended, at all. What I was saying was, most of these deaths are people that were going to die soon, anyway. Why ruin the lives of young people, for years, just so a sickly person can have another 3 months? Plus, why keep someone alive, if they have to live alone, in seclusion, unable to see their loved ones? Doesn't sound like living to me!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52446965">There were early reports of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time.  But the scientific consensus is that testing was the issue, with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus.  Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different.</a></p>

        <p>I remember way back in April thinking "ok this is basically a cold that no one has immunity to and everyone is gonna get sick" then I chuckled and thought about all the snowflakes who can't accept things they don't like and how there is no way out of this one I underestimated their willingness to destroy society but nonetheless there's no getting away from a highly contagious airborne pathogen. </p>
<p>I was much of the same mindset back when I was 21 I found myself in the back of a cop car in handcuffs for a dui and I thought nope nope nope this isn't happening im gonna get out of this and I litterslly started eating my shirt to "soak up the alcohol"</p>

        <p>I know! I agree with you. My dad and I were a bit sick during covid but we did not get tested because they are fake and false tests anyway. But my mum and sister didn’t get it? Maybe we got covid? Who knows? Everyone’s just going insane over it. 
I saw this post saying “I social distanced and wore a mask but I got covid. Wear your mask, social distance, wash your hands!” How stupid and brainwashed can you be? You did that and you still got the ailment? Your saying what you did which resulted in you getting it will stop the spread which doesn’t even exist. He probably got sick because he wore a mask.</p>

        <p>Think about the insanity of saying you’d never get the flu for the rest of your life. Actual influenza (not the stomach flu) really sucks to get but I’m not gonna avoid doing things in the winter because I may get the flu. Sometimes you get sick, that’s life. It sucks, but it’s life.</p>

        <p>But like... isn't that the same for all diseases?  Like of course the death rate would be higher if your immune system has been weakened from other things.  I'm sure that flu statistic included many people who had preexisting conditions.</p>
