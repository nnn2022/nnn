        <p>The problem with cult logic is that it denies real logic. So, the less sense the cult makes, the more vicious the believers become to rationalize everything they have done so far.</p>
<p>We are here if they want to see reason. They can still find the truth if they wish.</p>
<p>At this point, we must work towards our own survival and build alternatives to this failing society. The ship is sinking. The flood is here. Maybe we can fix the sky to stop us all from drowning. You have my respect for trying that. At some point, however, we must have our own lifeboat lest we drown.</p>
<p>They will eventually come at us to smother us all. This is real and it is happening.</p>

        <p>So if you take the vaccine, you are safe from covid. Great! (You might disagree but idgaf) but not everyone can get the vaccine. There isn't enough of it, or maybe they have a medical condition which means they can't. Or perhaps they don't want to. So if more people take it, then the ones who don't are protected, because there are less people for covid to spread to. So there are less people to spread it to in a room on average, so it slows down. </p>
<p>If there is a 25% chance that a person with the virus is in the room, and everyone has 50% chance of having the covid infected person walk up to them, infecting them if they aren't vaccinated (all made up figures but it's for the explanation) then everyone inside our room has a 1 in 8 chance of getting covid. So if there are 25 people in the room including the first guy with covid, that's 4 people with covid. Then let's say the unvaccinated person comes in this room. If he has a 50% chance of talking to someone also, then he will talk to half, which statistically means he would talk to two of the covid carriers in our room, meaning he has a 25% chance of getting covid. That isn't the best, particularly if our "can't get vaccinated" dude is vulnerable. </p>
<p>But if out of the 24 people in the room who didn't have covid at the start, 75% were vaccinated, then there is a 25% chance of the person the covid carrier is talking to isn't vaccinated. And if there is a 50% chance that he just doesn't talk to them anyway, them that means 12.5% of people get infected. 12.5% of 24 means 1 person. That means two people of the 24 get infected, and remember there is a 25% chance that no covid carrier walks into our room anyway. 3.125% chance of someone getting covid. Statistically, that means that there is a 1.3125% chance of our vulnerable unvaccinated person getting covid, which is a much nicer number than 25%. </p>
<p>That means if an unvaccinated person walks into the room there is less of a chance for them to get covid if more people are vaccinated. And I'd say a lot less than 25% of are people willing to go to our 25 person gathering when they aren't vaccinated. And if this was a party, you'd most likely talk to more than half of the 24 other people there. So think of this as an underexaggeration. </p>
<p>So that's why other people need to get vaccinated in order for it to have any effect. Because it isn't just about protecting yourself, it's about protecting the other people.</p>

        <p>Ok if you want an answer: why should you be responsible for someone who can't take the vaccine? Because otherwise their only choice is to stay home and never leave until covid is over, and I'm pretty sure this sub is against that whole idea. </p>
<p>You have the ability to get the vaccine and not only protect yourself but protect others, and some people can't. And saying "they should be responsible for themselves" is really shitty. If you saw someone being robbed or killed in an alleyway you would do something. You could very well do nothing, but then the victim suffers. Nobody is holding you accountable for the deaths of these unvaccinatable people, but nobody holds people accountable for turning a blind eye to a mugging or murder.</p>
