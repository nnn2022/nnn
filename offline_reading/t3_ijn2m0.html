    <strong>Do you think it's "selfish" to hold a wedding right now?</strong>
    <p><p>My sister's getting married in October, and postponing is DEFINITELY not on her agenda. This has been in the works for months, and she would lose out in thousands if she did. But all over the internet I keep seeing shit about how selfish it is for people to go through with weddings at this time. I'm honestly really conflicted about it. On the one hand, I know it's probably wise to be limiting large gatherings at this time, but on the other hand, we don't know how long covid's going to be around. Even with a vaccine, it could be here to stay forever. And I don't think it's fair to expect people to indefinitely postpone major life events like this.</p></p>

        <p>It’s her life.  If she wants to have her wedding she should.  Strangers may throw a little fit but they will get over it.  Maybe limit social media posts/photos to friends/family only? That way she won’t get hate and even threats from these “doomers”. </p>
<p>We can’t keep living in constant fear.  Eventually we have to get back to normal and actual normal not this “new normal” bull shit.</p>

        <p>Why is it wise to limit large gatherings at this time, but not during flu season?</p>
<p>Is COVID substantially more deadly than the flu? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Is COVID known to cause non-fatal damage that the flu can't also cause? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Does COVID's "novelty" make it substantially more infectious than the flu, thereby increasing the likelihood of overwhelmed hospitals? <strong>Maybe a few months ago, but not anymore, given the strong evidence in favour of herd immunity having been achieved or nearly achieved in most of the western world, including the US.</strong></p>
<p>Is there a vaccine for COVID that's as effective as the flu vaccine? <strong>Given the above points, this is irrelevant. Besides, we can't resign to living in a soulless dystopia on the promise of a vaccine that may never come.</strong></p>
<p>Conclusion: I see no reason why we should behave any differently now from how we do during flu season.</p>

<p>Playing the devil's advocate here, because I definitely think the lockdown measures are overblown, but 180k deaths is way more than the typical flu season.</p>

        <p>Flu numbers are estimates. The flu has never been hunted and tracked with basically unlimited resources by every government in the world, like covid has been this year. Very few people are ever tested for the flu. Thousands of people die every year that likely had been infected with the influenza virus, but they were never tested, so their death was never added to the official flu numbers. Comparing covid numbers to flu numbers is not a fair comparison. Every covid case is meticulously tested for. Every possible covid death is added to the covid death toll. The way we are monitoring covid is unprecedented and makes comparisons to other diseases difficult.</p>

        <p>Also, a huge chuck of American deaths are from bad human decisions early on. Sending sick people to nursing homes and the overuse of ventilators killed tens of thousands of people in April, that probably wouldn't have died otherwise. These mistakes inflates the death toll, and makes the disease appear to be more lethal than it actually is.</p>

        <p>I guess it depends on your definition of "substantial." The typical American flu season has averaged around 30k/year over the past decade, so if COVID deaths level out at around 200k (which seems likely), we're looking at 6 or 7 times worse than a typical flu season, and about 2 or 3 times worse than a nasty flu season. Nothing to sneeze at (pun partially intended), but also no reason to radically alter our way of life. And keep in mind that if we were as obsessed with tracking the flu as we are with COVID, that 30k number would undoubtedly be higher.</p>
<p>(It also depends on the country: In Sweden, where the flu season tends to be worse, their death count, which has already levelled off, is only about 3x as bad as a typical flu season.)</p>

        <p>No. It's time to get on with life. Anybody who isn't comfortable going can simply decline the invitation, and if they're in a very high-risk group that might be a wise decision. As long as the couple accepts they might get a few polite refusals (which they should accept anyway) there's nothing wrong with having a wedding.</p>

        <p>Yes, that is exactly my thought as well. They aren't forcing anybody to come, and they're actually being very gracious about the high risk folks who might need to stay home. It sucks that they have to miss out, but obviously we understand why being in a large group like that might not be the best idea.</p>

        <p>If you’re willing to give up living to protect against infinitesimally small risks, then you really aren’t living at all. </p>
<p>The risk here is negligible and no reason to change such a big event. </p>
<p>She should get married and not even think about it. The only concession I would even consider making would be to tell invitees that the couple will understand if they choose to not attend - so anyone who is concerned about attending has an easy pass to decline (and it’ll be more fun without anxious mask wearing guests, anyway).</p>

        <p>I feel strongly that people should continue to live their lives right now. The biggest danger to a young person is the public health response. These politician dictators of big pharma are spending like mad on faulty and mandatory PCR testing, and a host of Orwellian data mining and tracking operations.

        <p>Warning: her wedding won’t be that fun. There will be limits mandated by local authorities. I went to one with 100 people. Wife and I wore masks. Kids didn’t (though theoretically one was supposed to under Ontario law. Had to take food to go which we ate back at our place and obviously no booze/dancing.</p>
<p>The only reason they could even have a gathering that big was because it was a religious gathering which meant nothing that was like a “reception”</p>
<p>It wasn’t horrible and I was happy out to be there for my boy. But in our (south Asian) culture, weddings are a big deal and I feel so shitty for the couple not really getting to have a big day they’d been saving for awhile.</p>

        <p>Well the venue is privately-owned, so they told sister they basically operate according to their own rules. They’re not even mandating that we require masks for guests.</p>

        <p>My uncle is actually on the board, I think (that's how my sister was able to book so last minute), and he knows the owners pretty well. We also live in a very conservative community, one of the reddest areas in the country, and for better or worse, that means most people here aren't panicking about it.</p>
<p>So while I won't deny there's some fear in the back of my mind, I have to believe things will go ahead as planned, regardless of whatever hysteria might surround us.</p>

        <p>I’ve been seeing more wedding posts online, different parts of the US (so a variety of rules)... once the booze starts masks get forgotten. Sometimes they’re worn by guests during the ceremony but not always</p>

        <p>This is an issue close to my heart. I was supposed to get married in June 2020, tried again for July 2020, and we ultimately decided to push to June 2021. We still have people griping at us that it won’t be safe. Great. When will it be safe? 2030? Illness has always, always been present in the world. Like you said OP, it’s not fair or reasonable to expect people to keep postponing a major life event like this.</p>
