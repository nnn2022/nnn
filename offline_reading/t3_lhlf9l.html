<p>Every option was tried (and failed), floyd refused to cooperate since the very begining and even people on the street told him he should have listened/gotten in the car. He lost all credibility when he started screaming "I can't  breathe, I'm gonna die" as soon as he touched the police car's seat and continue for a while after that.</p>

        <p>I think there is a problem with police brutality, and I do think there is a racial aspect to it while also seeing that most cops are not vehement racists looking for a black person to kill. I think it's something you're going to get with that profession, because, relatively speaking, it's a position of power in the community and those positions can attract that exact type of people you do not want in those positions. </p>
<p>For me, the reason why George Floyd has been pushed so much is because it's the perfect instance to strike a divide between people. If you don't know any better, you see a poor African American man who, while he was breaking the law, did not deserve the fate delivered to him by the cops. You look into it a little more, and while yeah, it might still be a grey area for some people, you see why the cops did this as a protocol and not a modern day lynching. Not saying they handled it correctly, and the cop smirking as he knelt on the guy's neck didn't do anything to make himself not look like he was enjoying it. </p>
<p>It's another example of something with a lot of exaggerations and stretching of the truth being turned into a completely polarized issue with no questions asked unless you want to be a "racist" or "Soros shill." I remember in the immediate days following this, everyone I talked to, conservative, moderate, liberal, thought what happened was wrong. Then the media and politicians got ahold of it and it turned into a hyper-partisan topic in an already volatile society. </p>
<p>My inner conspiracy theorist sees this as a perfect way to get people split on the police in the middle of a forced lockdown/new normal that people were beginning to get sick of around Memorial Day. Imagine if BLM and the anti-lockdown protestors were to have joined forces in June against the oppressive state instead of seeing one another as the enemy? Can't have that happening. Gotta make them hate one another.</p>

        <p>&rt;while he [George Floyd] was breaking the law</p>
<p>Was he? There's no evidence of that. Even the suspicion he was under was only a citation offence. If he'd been "counterfeiting" there would have been at least some evidence. Passing a counterfeit bill only indicates you received a counterfeit bill and failed to identify it and remove it from circulating. If Floyd had one other bill on him or at his residence, I would be a bit more suspect.</p>
<p>&rt;You look into it a little more, and while yeah, it might still be a grey area for some people, you see why the cops did this as a protocol</p>
<p>Not a grey area at all, the hold was already banned which is why the officer was fired. </p>
<p>&rt;Not saying they handled it correctly, and the cop smirking as he knelt on the guy's neck didn't do anything to make himself not look like he was enjoying it. </p>
<p>Actually, I'm going to come to the defence of the officer a bit here. He reached for his gun (didn't draw it) to keep back a bystander who was telling him what was wrong with what he was doing. I don't think the officer was enjoying himself at all. Also, you can see an indication when the officer realizes he'd just killed Floyd. Floyd's body evacuated as a dead body would. There was a bit of horror on the officer's face when he realized what had happened and that he'd just been warned by witnesses that it was going to happen. </p>
<p>While I'm not one to say that officer was acting that way because he was specifically racist. I will say he acted that way because systemic racism allowed him to. There are plenty of black cops that can be seen doing these types of holds where specific racism isn't even in question. However, officers are far to often prejudice against, inarticulate, poor, unkempt, or incoherent suspects regardless of skin color. Unfortunately two of those things (inarticulate &amp; unkempt) are more subjective when you don't identify with the culture of the suspect. All four points seem to work against black culture especially when you're not black. That's the systemic aspects of racism. People aren't doing it consciously and can even articulate specific non racial excuses. I'm not sure it can be entirely done away with.</p>

        <p>I don't know if you are thinking of something else or if you just got confused but this is not about "filming cops". It's about the confidential body cam video only a few select people were allowed to watch, which only got to the public because one of those people recorded it as they watched to then share it. I hope this clears things a little bit.</p>

        <p>He wasn't on his neck, he was high on his back in the appropriate hold. He was restraining him because Floyd refused to get in the car, he wouldn't sit still, and they don't just let suspects under arrest wander around.</p>
<p>The "can't breathe" wasn't because a cop was kneeling on his back. He was saying that when the cops first arrived - because he had overdosed on fentanyl and was dying. Breathing problems are one of the symptoms.</p>

<p>I don't think the cops killed him, but it did look that way from the first video. The second video I saw showed (if I remember correctly) two additional cops holding him down and that he was handcuffed.</p>

        <p>...'The world witnessed Floyd's asphyxiation on video, and now defense counsel is asking us to disbelieve our own eyes. Multiple autopsies determined that he died of asphyxiation because of the officers kneeling on his back and neck.'  ...</p>

<p>I'd be curious to see and hear where you got your info from and why you think that it was the fentanyl. </p>

        <p>"Multiple autopsies" did not say he did of asphyxiation. There were two autopsies; the coroner's report was rewritten to claim that the cause of death was "homicide" in that his fentanyl-induced heart attack was "complicated by being restrained." The coroner's report said he had 4x a fatal dose of fentanyl, as well as meth and marijuana. He was complaining of being unable to breathe at the time the first officer arrived - it had nothing to do with the restraint because this was before he was restrained. He didn't have any damage to his throat and no bruising on his throat or back, according to the medical examiner. The family autopsy only release a series of opinions, not a report, and they didn't even look at the toxicology.</p>

        <p>How interesting. So basically he takes 4x fatal amount of fentanyl at somepoint then went to a store where he tried to use fake money and as he's being arrested dies of a heart attack. </p>
<p>Well, definitely can't see that from the video.</p>

        <p>I'm not taking a side on whether or not fentanyl killed him, just  want to say that a deadly fentanyl dose varies <strong>significantly</strong> depending on tolerance. What would easily kill an opioid naive person four times over might not even affect a hardcore addict. Also methamphetamine can increase the dose needed for fentanyl to be deadly...</p>

        <p>Kneeling on a neck (MRT - maximum restraint technique taught to officers) does not cause lungs to magically weigh 2-3 times what they should. Pulmonary edema from fatal dose of fentanyl (per the coroner's report). </p>

        <p>Black lives matter doesn't believe black lives actually matter. Only black votes. If they really did care, then they would be addressing the massive amounts of black on black crime that happens in proportionally greater numbers than any other form of racial crime, most of which is gang violence. If they actually cared about black lives, then they would overwhelmingly condemn Planned Parenthood for being the racist eugenicist organization that it is. It's a racist Marxist organization that cared more about optics than actually getting anything meaningful done.</p>

        <p>Yea ever encounter I’ve had with cops ended up fine. I listened. Most of the times I knew I was driving like an ass so what am I gonna argue? Lmao   and luckily Ive had no issues with the covid shit    I was at a pizzeria in Brooklyn, cop walked in massless so I took mine off. He didn’t say shit and started talking for a bit.   But the thing with cops is they put their paychecks first which I can get. They’ve got families to feed. But it comes to a certain point when they need to realize that following orders sometimes is the wrong thing to do   And if they don’t enforce it who’s gonna?</p>

        <p>Absolutely. The more extreme, brain melting viewpoints get all the attention to keep people away from looking into something. So when people start looking into certain connections, opinions, and actions of people in power at the time and leading up to the attacks, the most crazy idea gets promoted as something everyone asking questions believes. Bush not paying attention to the signs and having a lot of people around him who supported, hell, even published a study in the 90's about, the idea of a black swan event to get people motivated to invade a Middle Eastern country, has turned into Bush &amp; co creating holographic planes while laughing maniacally in the Situation Room.

        <p>Another problem with conspiracies is that there always has to be a "central command center" to this instead of realizing it's run by pure human greed. A lot of people have a lot of money, influence, and power to be gained through the policies that come out of certain mindsets. Why would WaPo ever question the lockdowns when the owner of that paper is raking in more money than because everyone is being forced to shop online for things? That's just one example, and while it would sound like I'm trying to say it's all Jeff Bezos, it's not. He's just a major beneficiary of these changes, has a lot of stake in it, and will be willing to play the game in order to gain from this. </p>
<p>There are a lot of people just like this out there, they have control of major media and other companies, and while they may communicate together like other like-minded people and loose coalitions do, this isn't something cooked up by a secret society in some evil villain lair.</p>

<p>Somewhat. Depends on the tangibility of the outputs produced.</p>
<p>Certainly your average leftist/doomer has far too much faith in these things.</p>

        <p>Are helmets safe for our heads? Do they really help our brains? Or are people just trying to take advantage of our fear of brain injuries in order to sell helmets?</p>
<p>The point I’m making is that both can be true. It can be a real problem AND people can be trying to take advantage of the general public’s fear of that problem.</p>

        <p>Like I said - Tangibility matters.</p>
<p>There's a difference between someone who's hired to build a bridge and someone who's paid to produce ideas.</p>
<p>If the bridge falls down, the engineer gets fired. If it turns out men can't be women, the professor who suggested otherwise still gets tenure. If it turns out that the minimum wage creates more unemployment, the professor who suggested it still gets a platform for life, and probably ignored that consequence because it sounds so moral. </p>
<p>If it turns out climate change is not an issue, all the climate scientists become unemployed...</p>

        <p>Alright, then let’s be specific. Which part of climate change are you questioning? It sounds to me like it’s the timeline of predictions, but you agree that climate change could some day be problematic. Let me know if it’s something else, please!</p>
<p>The cost of guessing we have more time than we do costs millions of lives and trillions of dollars. The cost of doing what needs to be done early is still costing trillions of dollars, but it would save lives. It seems like an easy choice to me - be early. Convert away from fossil fuels as soon as reasonably possible, being mindful of jobs and helping people convert from (for a simple example) coal mining to solar panel installation. </p>
<p>The notion that powerful people see an opportunity to make money on fear of a given problem doesn’t change the fact that the problem still exists and should be addressed.</p>

        <p>You’re absolutely right! It will continue to change! And it’s always been changing! </p>
<p>However, the rate of change is important to measure. And the components that are changing are important to notice. </p>
<p>1 quick example. The ozone has not previously changed in the ways it is currently changing (e.g. growing holes in it). </p>
<p>Can’t say whether you’re super smart but at minimum it seems to me you’re not dumb - so think on why holes in the ozone (one of the most critical things to allow life on earth, as I’m sure you know) could be problematic. Earth’s shield is deteriorating and we know how to stop it, we just aren’t doing it fast enough. The ozone wasn’t deteriorating before the industrial era.</p>

        <p>We don't 100% know that the Ozone layer wasn't deteriorating before the industrial revolution, the Ozone layer wasn't discovered until 1913 and the spectrometer wasn't invented till the mid 1920s. </p>

        <p>I support BLM but am highly skeptical of the corona measures and am really concerned about the two issues being artificially linked in debate. It should be possible to criticise the government response to corona without people making assumptions about my stand on other issues. Very uneasy about this.</p>

        <p>Friend returned home from NYC for Christmas a couple months. She worked in NYC's DHS. Went to the bar (fuck you govnah!). She got insanely drunk for the first time in a while. She starts going off about covid numbers, almost gets into a fight with someone who had a 95 year old relative die from it, and I had to drag her out and home. We get back to her place, and that's where the fun starts ;) ...I have her go over everything she knows and wrote it down as we smoked cigs into the night. </p>
<p>After a hot night of steamy propaganda and conditioning debunking, she wakes up the next morning and casually makes her way to my kitchen, sits down next to me, and says "I talked about covid last night, didn't I?" </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Did anyone take my name?"</p>
<p>"lol no."</p>
<p>"Good. Never mention this again."</p>
<p>Starts crying that she could lose everything, not just her job but entire career, if it gets out she's airing the dirty laundry. I tell her to stop being so paranoid, she snaps back that I just don't get it. I was dumb enough to mention the notes I jotted down, and she wanted those put through my paper shredder. Haven't really talked about it again after that. She's a very good friend of mine, so I wasn't going to ruin that over something I have a million other sources that tell me the same thing. Yeah, it's nice to have a little anecdote to share without going in-depth, but beyond that, I think everyone here knows what I mean by "covid numbers." </p>
<p>Also, to the newbies, don't take this at face value. Do your own research, don't be the guy or gal who backs themselves into a corner by saying "I read a post on Reddit where someone knows someone who..." I am not posting proof of my friend's profession, she would never consider doing an AMA, so take my little anecdote with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>Easier said than done, my friend. Everyone is a freedom fighter until they actually have to take into consideration that they're not just putting themselves at risk, but their families as well. It would be great if everyone today had the mindset of the American Founding Fathers, who knew they and their families could be targeted for treason, but saw the cause as just enough to move forward, but times have changed. We're a society that, even the "don't tread on me" gun nuts, heavily rewards compliance and punishes going against the grain. Even more so than back in the day when you would get hanged for treason. </p>
<p>I don't think many people see much reward in standing up to this if everything they say gets scrubbed from the platforms used to spread information. Why ruin your life if what you say is only going to be seen by the people who don't need any more convincing? Why come out about something, as a modern day peasant, when the iron fist of our corporate media will cancel them and everything they say? </p>
<p>A very noble virtue, yes, but one that 99% of people are going to see as a hopeless endeavor. How do you change that mindset? I don't know, and I'm not about to ruin a friendship with someone to find out how.</p>

        <p>If they test positive and die within 28 days of a positive test then it goes down as a covid death on the death certificate I believe. </p>
<p>I would imagine presenting that death certificate in court if you were on trial for that persons murder would show that they died of covid according to the rules so covid did indeed kill them.</p>
<p>Common sense no longer applies to this land so I could imagine this defence being presented and being successful.</p>

        <p>But die 25 minutes after getting the jab, "no, it's not the jab that caused the death". Because 15 minutes is the time limit lol. <br>
And why haven't smokers been prosecuted for murder of innocents breathing their secondhand smoke? That's another "they" aren't doing it for health reasons! Since cigarettes are still produced and sold by the millions, even though millions have died over decades from it. Drug addicts gotta have their drugs. Smokers may not like that title, but if you look at facts...<br>

        <p>More simply - flu cases are down and covid cases are up because everything is being counted as covid, with a notoriously false positive test that should never be used for diagnosis. Stated by the creator of said test, Kary Mullis on video, probably still available if anyone wants to search for it.</p>

        <p>As of right now there is no way to be fully safe with the corona virus, even if you have the vaccine you are still able to spread it. If you had it before and got anti bodies afterwards those only last 3-6 months until you are susceptible again. This virus will not go away until everyone works together. Now it’s ur turn to be specific on how you are immune.</p>

<p>According to you,even if everyone gets this virus and gets antibodies, everyone will get it again 3 to 6 months later and so no one will ever be safe from it and it'll keep spreading until the entire planet is dead.  Am I reading this right?</p>

        <p>No you are not, in your situation you described it would work but that will never happen bc not everyone will get anti bodies at the same time, as it stands when your anti bodies no longer keep you immune there are still other people out there that can spread it to you again.</p>

        <p>I never said at the same time.  You did.  So your stance really is that everyone on the planet will get this again and again until we're all dead which means that you plan on hiding under your bed for the rest of your entire life.</p>
<p>What a sad life you're going to lead.  I'll leave that totally to you.</p>
<p>See, I have read many studies that show that this virus cannot be contracted more than once and that antibodies are not the only force at play in getting immunity.  See, I've taken a couple of anatomy courses in college and I know a thing or two about the immune system.  I'd go into it, but then, why would I waste my time on someone who has given up on life?</p>
<p>Not everyone is going to wear a mask.  In fact, several countries and states have already dropped mask mandates and some never even had any to begin with.  Not every state has closed down businesses and banned gatherings.  Nearly half of healthcare workers like myself have refused to get the vaccine due to the very nasty side-effects (and the fact that it was developed using skin from aborted babies - yes this has been proven and fact checked and proven some more).</p>
<p>Your dream of everyone working together are never ever going to happen.  Wyoming has just announced that it's dropping all lockdown measures and mask mandates.  More will follow.   You'll never ever be able to leave your house.  You'll never be able to take off your magical mask.  You will forever be a prisoner of fear.</p>

        <p>Nah, not me.  I know I'm immune.  It's you who is lost- after all, don't you wear a mask to protect others?  When everyone else stops wearing one, what will protect you from the fear of covid?</p>

        <p>Even if it turns out ur completely correct I will not feel bad at all about wearing a mask in the hopes to protect others, it’s not an inconvenience at all</p>

        <p>Everybody listen. I am Candy The Strippers father and I want to apologize for his behavior lately. There is reason for this and it is called being a liberal.</p>
<p>I know he's a slow bastard but I'm just proud that he managed to eat his cereal today without dropping majority of it on his lap.</p>
