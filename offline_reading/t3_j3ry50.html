    <strong>New to this subreddit, have no idea what this is.</strong>
    <p><p>Can someone explain what this is? Please? I seriously have no idea, it seems like a subreddit thinking that the coronavirus is just a cold or a flu even though it’s an entirely different virus, people who don’t want to wear masks, etc. Please inform me of what this place is about.</p></p>

        <p>It's a bunch of people questioning the mainstream media narrative of the coronavirus and anaylysing the effectiveness of masks</p>
<p>And if any of the restrictions make sense
Most people here know it's worse then a typical flu but more so is it as bad as the MSM say and if the death rate is accurate</p>

        <p>I’m on mobile, I did see it but I guess I only really glanced at it. Also, it really seems filled with a lot of these kinds of people where they full on believe this stuff. Of course, there still are skeptics and such.
Skepticism
1.
a skeptical attitude; doubt as to the truth of something.</p>
<p>2.
the theory that certain knowledge is impossible.</p>

        <p>It's a subreddit where idiots congregate to find the "truth" about the "virus scam". I've already found people saying how they don't care about anyone whose died and that the government is trying to erode their rights.</p>
<p>While they haaate that people are being "oppressed for their beliefs" (aka, endangering the lives of others) they also will downvote you if you have a different opinion to them.</p>
<p>They constantly complain that the lockdowns are ineffective, saying they'll disregard stay at home orders and masks, then wonder why it hasn't ended yet. </p>
<p>Oh? New Zealand and Australia are basically functioning societies because they listened to the corona virus orders? Na na na na, I can't hear you!</p>
<p>I'm already losing my sanity seeing these numbskulls parade their stupidity while thinking they have foiled the plans of the tyrannical government. I would call them Neanderthals but that would probably be a compliment - they have a much higher IQ than anyone else in here!</p>
<p>I can't wait to get banned. Then I can mimic them by throwing a big tantrum and crying myself to sleep because "muh rights and freedoms are being taken away!!!"</p>
<p>Leave. It'll only benefit you. Of course, you're also welcome to come to your own decisions based on your own judgement.</p>

        <p>No one in the world is pushing for this to become the new normal. Australia and New Zealand are almost running entirely the same as before, with mask and social distancing precautions still being held to ensure the people's safety. No one here has any doubts that life will go back to normal once the virus has been beaten.</p>
<p>Asian countries wore masks whenever sick before corona struck. For them, wearing a mask was never an infringement of their rights because they would do so anyway. </p>
<p>My life actually hasn't changed at all since corona started, except for a few weeks of online stuff before being allowed to go back to in-person.</p>
<p>If anything, I'd welcome a "new normal" where people are able to work from home, online, instead of going into an office.</p>
<p>The people that frequent this sub are of course largely anti-vax coronahoaxers. The same subset of people that don't believe in vaccines and coronavirus are the people who somehow believe governments will use the virus as a way to erode civilian rights.</p>
<p>Of course, if everything goes all 1984 on us after everything blows over, please come back and scream "I told you so". I'd laugh at myself in that case.</p>

<p>I have to wonder if your opinion might not be different if you had, let's say, lost your job.  Or been forcibly quarantined.  Or unable to visit your parents.   Or had your cancer treatments cancelled.  Or been unable to go to a dentist for a toothache.  Or even just had all classes go online indefinitely. </p>

        <p>Yea, exactly the same as normal, only with pregnant women being arrested and people's doors being smashed in because of Facebook posts.  Oh, and a collapsing economy with record unemployment.  Sounds fine to me. </p>
<p>In Asian countries, you may wear a mask if you like, that isn't an issue, the issue is the mandatory wearing of masks under threat of state violence, which is what we are against.  If you search for 'new normal' you will find many, many articles stating that 'we are never returning to normal' and most frame that as a good thing.  So you're wrong, there is a push to make this permanent.</p>
<p>Almost noone here is a corona hoax antivaxxer, that is a strawman and honestly pretty slanderous.  It's interesting that you see nothing to worry about but here in the UK Lord Sumption, a former supreme court judge, has called this the greatest attack on civil liberties since Cromwell, who lived in the 1600s.  So is he, along with a whole slew of other academics, philosophers and lawmakers, also a corona hoax antivaxxer? Should I be listening to you, some random redditor who probably still lives in their mom's basement instead?  Nah, I don't think so.  Your life probably hasn't changed because you barely went outside or had any social interaction to start with - that or you live in Sweden, one of the countries who dealt with this well, and who do not wear masks, by the way.  Clearly all Swedes enjoy endangering each others lives, as you put it.</p>

        <p>I don't know about the issues you pointed out in your first paragraph. Assuming you're from America, those might be issues occurring there and not where I am. I do know you have a lot of issues with your police force, so I think some of those issues are about the police themselves, not any governmental control. </p>
<p>I could literally go and take screenshots of all the "corona isn't bad" and "there's no way they can get me to take the vaccine!!" people to prove you wrong.</p>
<p>But I won't, because this will be the last time I post here. It was hilarious watching squadrons of you guys come in and claim the world is going to end because you are temporarily wearing masks and being in lockdown.</p>
<p>^(Hilariously, someone tried calling part of Australia, yes <em>Australia</em>, one of "the most authoritarian places in the world". Sounds like he's never been to Australia!)</p>

        <p>I'm from the UK, I actually mention that in my post but I guess you lack the attention span to get to the 3rd paragraph.  Of course you don't know about any of those issues because you are ill informed and haven't read anything beyond what the government tells you.  There are mass breaches of civil liberty happening globally. </p>
<p>I could literally go and take a screenshot of people saying I hope you die as a response to concerns about lockdown and masks, it doesn't mean that that is the majority position.  Hilarious you mention 'squadrons' of us when it's guys like you coming here brigading our sub.  See ya later, don't come back.</p>
