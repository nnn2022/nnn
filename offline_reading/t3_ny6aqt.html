    <strong>Dispelling the misinformation spread on this sub.</strong>
    <p><p>I've noticed many people on this sub are in denial of the possibility of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, sometimes citing <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774102">this meta-analysis</a> as supposed evidence that such transmission is hardly possible.</p>
<p>But if you’ve actually bothered to read the study and the papers it’s referencing instead of reading about it in some dodgy Facebook post, you would’ve realised that it doesn’t disprove presymptomatic spread. <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/28/facebook-posts/no-recent-study-didnt-find-no-asymptomatic-spread-/">There is a good overview of what you’ve missed</a>. In summary:</p>
<p>(1) Presymptomatic spread has a lower attack rate but is definitely possible.</p>
<p>(2) The study looked only at household transmission, missing an important piece of the puzzle, which is community spread. The findings cannot be used to inform public policies targeting community spread, such as mask mandates or lockdowns.</p>
<p>(3) The number of studies on asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission this meta-analysis looked at is very small, which the authors themselves admit. It’s only four studies [<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-2263_article">26</a>, <a href="https://www.e-epih.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4178/epih.e2020046">43</a>, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1166/5893024">44</a>, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/8/20-1274_article">52</a>].</p>
<p>When you look at the cited papers, you’ll notice that two of them [43, 44] weren’t even designed to study asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission. The results are merely a by-product. Paper [26] is also the only one that analysed a considerable number of asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases (hundreds). It found the household attack rates for symptomatic, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases to be 14.4%, 6.1% and 4.4% respectively. What’s more, it observed <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-2263-t3">the overall attack rate (i.e. household and community spread combined) to be comparable for asymptomatic/presymptomatic and symptomatic people</a>. As mentioned above, paper [43] didn’t try to measure the presymptomatic attack rate. It did, however, observe it to be possible. Paper [44] didn’t look at presymptomatic transmission at all, and paper [52] only at 11 such cases. If the attack rate were to be consistent with [26], they shouldn’t find a single secondary infection in that sample.</p>
<p>The fact that the meta-analysis lumped together asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases is rather questionable, considering that there is little evidence for asymptomatic spread but a wealth of evidence for presymptomatic spread (<a href="https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&amp;bid=0015&amp;list_no=366637&amp;act=view">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120970/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7184331/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.01.20135194v4">4</a>). Many studies report that peak infectiousness occurs shortly before the onset of symptoms (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">5</a>, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30172-5/fulltext">6</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121626/">7</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x">8</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131901/">9</a>). The first paper estimated the proportion of presymptomatic transmission to be 44%. Paper [52] also observed that the SIR in crowded non-household settings can be as high as 43.5%.</p>
<p>This all shows why the restrictions target non-symptomatic people as well.</p>
<p>My question for you is:  What do you, guys, think about drunk driving? Should drunk people be legally allowed to drive because, ultimately, it's their body? Presymptomatic COVID-19 spread poses a much higher risk to others than drunk driving. Why do most of feel entitled to risk other people's lives?</p></p>

        <p>Covid isn’t as dangerous as you think it is. If you read <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">this</a> study, you will see that community transmission rates are on par with a common cold, and the rates of people that fall critically ill from Covid are infinitesimal.</p>

        <p>You guys lose nothing by saying this or that is 'definitely possible'.</p>
<p>It is definitely possible to die from electric shock from 12V car battery. However, it is definitely not practical to worry about it.</p>
<p>It is very easy for you to impose restrictions that others should follow, based on sheer possibility. You will never get banned for saying COVID can be transmitted in a certain situation. Nobody(except filthy antimaskers) will even argue with you that COVID can soak through thick concrete walls: heck, if it convinces one antimasker to wear a mask, lying is worth it!</p>
<p>However, you can get banned or get a strike by saying COVID cannot be transmitted in a certain situation, or that certain situations are safe. Same as in any totalitarian state: nobody ever got punished in USSR for being too communist, so people were spitting out all kind of nonsense to prove that they are loyal.</p>

        <p>If you read my post and the sources, you'll find out that there's plenty of evidence showing that it's possible and responsible for a sizable share of the transmission.</p>

        <p>How about this. I don't give a fuck about the health of anyone else except me and mine? I'm healthy, and if I'm asymptomatic then thats the way of the world. Why do you people think you can just change centuries and centuries of biological values? We need a small amount of bacteria in order to thrive and when our environment gets too muddled with pollutants those microbiota get our of control. Like gut flora. A great comparison is what we do to our gut. </p>

        <p>Of course it's plausible that certain diseases could be spread by an asymptomatic host. Think of how many times you've been sick without being in contact with someone with symptoms. Surface spread could be a factor too, obviously. The point is it's impractical to try and reduce spread this way as you'd have to be testing everyone all the time. The tests we have aren't that accurate and it only would lead to lockdowns and masking which do more harm than good. Additionally, the mindset that "you are responsible for keeping me safe" is a slippery slope. Yes, there's such a thing as gross negligence, but just living together in a society comes with presumed risks. You could argue the real threat is people who are old and overweight since they had the hardest time getting over Covid and bogged down the HC system. We should be focusing more efforts on healthy eating and habits instead of taking a reactive approach when a new virus comes along.</p>

        <p>Yet they have no issue manipulating and coercing billions of people into a novel gene therapy trial. Seems it's not actually about ethics. Most of what they deem "bioethics" is just rationalizing forced medical interventions.</p>
<p>Edit: they also could do transmission studies of the common cold with no ethical concerns.</p>

<p>what makes you say "covid 19 presyptomatic spread is more dangerous than drunk driving", what makes you come to this conclusion?</p>

        <p>In 2019, about 280 people in the UK were killed by drunk drivers. 85k people were convicted for drunk driving. Assuming that those 85k people accounts for all such incidents (unlikely), if you drink drive you have a 0.3% chance that you'll kill someone. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0">COVID-19 kills 1% of the infected or so in the UK</a>. With no restrictions/vaccines, an infected person will on average infect three others. In other words, the chance that you'll kill at least one person if you just act like normal is about 3%.</p>
<p>P(A U B U C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A ∩ B) - P(A ∩ C) - P(B ∩ C) + P(A ∩ B ∩ C) = [(0.01+0.01+0.01) - (0.01*0.01) - (0.01*0.01) - (0.01*0.01) + (0.01*0.01*0.01)] * 100% = 2,97%</p>

        <p>and i know some people like to use the argument "if we hadnt prevented the spread with politically decided lockdowns and masks etc etc, we would have the virus rip, which is an unethical experiment"</p>
<p>as a counter argument i would bring:</p>
<p>lockdowns and similar measures (including fear inducing communication via media and politicians) themselves are an unethical experiment.. especially if no risk-benefit analysis is presented. i conclude, the measures kill. one example:

        <p>The risk benefit analysis has been done by every country. The alternative to no lockdowns is not people happily going about their business. It's the epidemic getting completely out of control like it did in Lombardy, where <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7520169/">a 2-fold increased in the number of deaths was recorded</a>. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/49/6/1909/5923437">The hardest hit provinces experienced excess deaths at a level of 800%</a>.</p>
<p>Many countries, including the UK, tried very hard to avoid locking down, but it proved impossible. <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">A report by Imperial College concluded that if no measures were taken, the pandemic would kill 500k people in the UK</a>, assuming everyone who needed treatment would receive it. That's the price of reaching herd immunity naturally. As we know from Bergamo, New York City etc., many people would not receive help if we allowed the pandemic to run wild. And that's just COVID-19 deaths. Many other people would die due to the collapse of the healthcare system, far more than <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/198444/report-estimates-9000-non-covid-excess-deaths/">the estimated non-COVID excess deaths</a>, which for current figures translate to tens of thousands. <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n44">Those deaths are attributed to the health system pressure caused by the pandemic</a>. Things would've been even worse without lockdowns.</p>

        <p>What I read was 'experts say' people spread it Presymptomatic ally,  but couldn't really show us proof... they just think it happens. </p>
<p>How does it spread? It spreads via water droplets.  Symptoms such as a cough, runny nose or sneeze will spread the droplets. Breathing normally will not. Most people breath through their nose unless speaking, or working out. </p>
<p>If there are not symptoms, there is no water droplets. Also there needs to be viral load. People cannot get sick from a single viral fragment, there needs to be millions of virus in the air to infect.</p>

        <p>Household sets the <em>upper</em> bound on transmission frequency because it's where asymptomatic transmission is most likely to happen: indoors, fairly small air volume, no commercial-grade air circulation and ventilation, and in the same room/house as the infected asymptomatic person for many hours a day every day. Other everyday situations would be much shorter exposure time with more dilution in the air. Lower risk.</p>
