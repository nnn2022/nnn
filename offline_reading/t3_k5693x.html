        <p>I have usually considered myself I opposition to anti-vaxxers but the way this is being handled by government and their lackeys has made me deeply sceptical. It's not unfair or unreasonable to be cautious about a newly and possibly hastily made vaccine.</p>

        <p>There is no need for a vaccine, for a disease with a 99.7percent survival rate.</p>
<p>Even the flu vaccine gets criticized heavily by (generally pro vaccine) health experts (doctors and scientists).</p>

        <p>Some excerpts I thought were interesting:</p>
<p>“In the imagination of extreme opponents of vaccination — or anti-vaxxers — every human inoculated against coronavirus will be turned into a chimera, injected with nanoparticles that beam out their biometric data and commoditised with bar codes linked to cryptocurrency.” </p>
<p>“UK public health experts do not engage with the fringe figures pushing these views, such as the conspiracy theorist David Icke, a former footballer who has been banned from some social media platforms for publishing unsubstantiated theories about the virus. But they do worry that anti-vaxxers are making incursions into the mainstream ahead of a looming battle to persuade the public that mass immunisation is the way out of the pandemic.”</p>
<p>“In the past month, three separate vaccine breakthroughs have been announced — by Oxford university and AstraZeneca in the UK; Pfizer in the US with BioNTech in Germany; and Moderna in the US — bringing hopes of an end to the pandemic.”</p>
<p>“In other recent polls, there have been signs that the public is increasingly cautious about the vaccine. Concerns are centred on the safety of experimental vaccines and the speed with which they have been tested — and come against a backdrop of broader mistrust of the government’s handling of the pandemic.”</p>
<p>‘A survey by market research company Kantar at the end of November found that 75 per cent of people in the UK were “likely” to accept a jab. But only 42 per cent said they would definitely do so, and “the hesitancy is growing”. “The ones we care about are the fence sitters,” said Simon Piatek, a digital analytics expert at the VCP. “The anti-vaxxers are also targeting this group,” he warned.’</p>
<p>“According to the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, the number of those following the largest anti-vaxxer accounts on social media platforms has increased 19 per cent, or 7.8m people, this year.”</p>
<p>‘At that time the anti-vax agenda was being amplified on social media by Russia, said Rose Bernard, a research fellow at King’s College London and author of a recent report on the online danger to public health posed by hostile states. “It didn’t take on an anti-establishment dimension until all these bot campaigns started,” she said, adding that more recent disinformation from Moscow has included memes targeting the Oxford vaccine.’</p>
<p>“The UK government has become more proactive about countering these threats in recent weeks. The Cabinet Office has a rapid response unit scouting out disinformation. This month five social media platforms, including Google, Twitter and Facebook, agreed measures to limit its spread. A separate Whitehall Counter Disinformation Unit is charged with responding to harmful content on social media, taking it down where necessary and promoting authoritative information in its place.”</p>
<p>‘Dr Matthew Snape, a consultant in paediatrics and vaccinology who has been at the forefront of developing the Oxford vaccine, said it was futile trying to counter every bogus claim. Instead, the government and scientists needed to put forward their own convincing line: “Most of the story will be about getting on the front foot and generating a positive message rather than being reactive,” he added. To this end, the government is already “looking at a wider campaign” to increase uptake of the vaccine using celebrities and well-known public figures, environment secretary George Eustice said on Monday.’</p>
