    <strong>You are complicit in perpetuating lockdown theatre every time you walk into a store with no mask and then immediately comply when someone asks you to wear one</strong>
    <p><p>Every time you submit, you empower and validate the lockdown enforcers. You demoralize those who might secretly be against the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Screw your temporary comfort. Take a real stand now while it's easy, before it becomes not so easy.</p></p>

        <p>This so much, every time you comply even a bit you are contributing to it all, learn how to say no and mean it. In most places you'll be fine besides certain big retail stores that will swarm you like a bunch of wasps if you don't. I got a kick out of it as maddening as it was and not being able to shop soon after, it was one of the creepiest things I ever witnessed. You can't reason with a mask enforcer they have a a hive mind instead of one of their own and they are drunk with the power of it because they're certainly not empowered in any other way.</p>

        <p>I’ve found that ignoring them like you would a misbehaving or bratty child works very well. I just keep walking and make them work for it. And I only leave if they actually call the cops. I’m not afraid of being fined for being normal. </p>

        <p>Yep. Submission is the food for this monster. </p>
<p>The mask is CORE to keeping the spell of fear and compliance in effect. </p>
<p>Without it, there would be no visual representation of it. There would be no willful and physical act of submission to this conditioning.</p>

        <p>I have a question for Americans: are you not fined for not wearing a mask? In my country in Eastern Europe we get fines between 130$ - 630$ depending on the mood of the policeman... And since most of us are poor we kind of have to wear it because we can't afford fines. How do you guys deal?</p>
<p>(I'm not promoting or approving mask wearing in any way. I hate it as much as everyone here but I can't afford fines right now)</p>

        <p>Can I ask you, if they had a regulation, that forced you to smoke cigarettes, in order to go out of your house, what would you do? Because that's what facemasks are causing me. And the wealth of the entire planet cannot bring back health.</p>
<p>Dyspnea with healthy adults</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p><em>Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask</em> </p>
<p>If they accuse you of spreading disease then demand evidence, that you personally are spreading disease. </p>
<p>So the point is you contest the "fine" because it's not only a scam, but a facemask can damages health (I can prove it in my case). And you don't need to prove to them that you have already a condition that justifies not wearing one. The fact facemasks damage health pretty like cigarettes do is enough.</p>

<p>Maybe you can win years later when you're homeless and poor because of the lawyer fees, but it's more probable you lose.</p>

        <p>Sadly. Most Americans "think" the ENTIRE world has the EXACT same laws  rules and regulations.  Here in Cuckanada,  you can get a $1000 fine ( $1300-1400 USA currency ) for not wearing a mask ( That's 2 weeks wages for most people ) . Spoiled rich kids who order food online and never have to leave the house tend to be the ones telling other  people to just "not comply".</p>

        <p>We have a $250 fine in Round Rock Texas just north of Austin but the cops don't enforce it. I was threatened by a maskhole at the beginning of the mandate he was going to call the cops, but instead he cried to the manager like a whiney bitch who did nothing. I kept shopping with my family. I knew the cops weren't going to come and fine me and even if they did considering how long it takes for them to show up to report a non violent crime I'd be long gone by then, lol.</p>

        <p>Here in Cuckanada multiple squad cars will called to the grocery store for the high crime of not wearing a mask. 
So you can "choose" not to wear a mask in a "great act of defiance"....... but then you'll starve and have a 1000$  dollar fine.</p>

        <p>Fellow Canadian here.</p>
<p>Almost every jurisdiction here has medical exemptions. <em>Use them.</em> They can't ask for proof, either.</p>
<p>I never wear a mask while shopping. In general, they don't say anything. If they do, I claim the medical exemption I am entitled to use - I also carry a copy of the bylaw in my wallet, with the appropriate sections highlighted.</p>
<p>They won't call the cops, because as soon as you claim a medical exemption, there are no grounds to charge or fine you.</p>
<p>Use their own bullshit rules against them.</p>
<p>Our US friend is right - if we don't fight this and refuse to obey, it's never going to end.</p>

        <p>You watch way to many "lawyer" movies and television. I was asked to leave multiple stores BEFORE the mask mandates ( back in April, May and June )  became a thing . Same with Banks. They LITERALLY have people standing in the entrance and refuse entry if you refuse to wear a mask. Plus I'm not a Karen, so I'm not going to give some minimum wage employee a hard time about rules and laws they had no part in drafting. Go shit on politicians and public health officials and leave the minimum wage employees alone.</p>

        <p>&rt;You watch way to many "lawyer" movies and television. I was asked to leave multiple stores BEFORE the mask mandates</p>
<p>So you knuckled under <em>before the mandates even happened.</em> Got it. I would have called the cops if I were you. The store had no grounds to refuse you entry.</p>

<p>Remember that statement when some low-level functionary tells you that you can't fly, can't go the pub, can't work without "the vaccine". Solzhenitsyn warned us about what happens when you stick your head in the sand and "go along to get along" with the foot soldiers of tyranny. You can fight the easy stuff early, or you can have to fight the hard stuff, against worse odds, later. Your choice.</p>
<p>Your post is simply a fancy way of saying "I don't want to fight, because it might be inconvenient, or I might offend some pimply-faced rent-a-cop".</p>
<p>In closing, I will leave this for you:</p>
<p><em>“If ye love wealth better than liberty, the  tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom,  go home from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down  and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you,  and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen.”</em>     </p>

<p>Jesus fucking wept - I can't believe I actually have to point this out to you.</p>
<p><strong>Publicly disobeying their edicts is doing exactly that.</strong> And it's the only way said officials will get the message.</p>
<p>I don't wear a mask, I don't social distance, and I refuse to follow the stupid Pac-Man arrows on the floor. I do my best to get others to question the narrative. I don't shop at mask-Nazi establishments. I don't spend money at Amazon, Walmart, or the other mega-corps profiteering from this scam. I have written and emailed every politician in my area, at every level of government. I will refuse the vaccine.</p>

It's up to them what orders they choose to follow and I think you'll find, just following orders or just doing my job is not an excuse.

        <p>Maybe in the beginning. If you're in an area where it's already been totally normalized...i.e. you haven't seen a maskless person in any of these places for months, I'd argue it's not helpful. That is, you'll come off as a "Karen" if you go about it in a way that causes a scene and you'll characterize people who would resist as naive or tactless.</p>
<p>For the vaccine, sure, we've had our warm up and there is zero excuse not to to say "fuck you" from the jump and give it no ground. </p>
<p>For masks and the stupid safety theater, I'd say subtlety, malicious compliance, a bit of humor, etc. is a better way to start adding some friction back to the system. I heard one guy say that he had a policy to act stone deaf the first TWO times someone asks about his mask, wearing it around his neck and just acting like he forgot to pull it up. Whatever you can do to send a signal is contextual to your situation.</p>
<p>I guess in another way I'm saying </p>
<p>&rt;    Take a real stand now while it's easy, before it becomes not so easy.</p>
<p>...we have vaccines rolling out in full force in days. I think we're already here.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately in this country (Canada) you cannot enter anywhere without a mask, to the extent that anything is even open (only grocery stores).</p>
<p>The only place we have been "granted" the government's mercy and grace to be maskless is our home and the sidewalk.</p>

        <p>Maybe easy in the USA. </p>
<p>In Hungary, the government was wiser.</p>
<p>They are issuing huge fines for shops who don't enforce the rules, and thise shops can be also be closed for weeks by the police.</p>
<p>So it's a collective punishment, not just penalty for the person not wearing the mask.</p>
<p>It works.</p>

        <p>Easiest solution for me, and is drama free: respect the decision of private business to have their customers wear a mask, and if I disagree, do not patronize that business.  There is no restaurant or retail place that I HAVE to enter because they offer something no one else does.  I don’t agree with their stipulations to conduct commerce in their location, so I simply won’t.</p>

        <p>I agree in theory.</p>
<p>In practice, I just submit to the mandatory face marks and other regulations whenever not submitting can result in a fine or conflict with the people around me.</p>
<p>It's a pragmatic choice. I choose my battles. My life isn't at a stage where I can afford taking too many unnessary risks or creating too much unnecessary stress.</p>
<p>In theory I agree with you... but, at least for now, I don't put it into practice.</p>

        <p>I agree. </p>
<p>I wore a mask just over my mouth due to asthma to a drs apt. to see if I have uterine cancer, they turned me away for not being able to cover my nose up. I did try to comply but when I covered my nose I went into a full panic attack, I ended up having to cancel the apt. </p>
<p>They pretty much didn't give a crap that I could have cancer, they cared more about a piece of clothe that is useless anyway. </p>
<p>I've learned to never comply, in fact I don't even wear a mask anymore.</p>
