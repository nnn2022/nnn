        <p>Just read it, it says nothing of the sort lol. It doesn't even have the phrase "temporary isolation" in it anywhere. It essentially just says trying national guard personnel can work in hospitals and drive ambulances, which has been going on in several states</p>

<p>Really not sure how you can blatantly ignore or shrug off this info. Alot of ppl in tennesse are pretty concerned about this, in fact, claiming it leaves doors open to vague interpretation that could potentially lead to major civil rights abuses under the guise of a public emergency.. </p>
<p>what happens when medical authorities deem a person mentally unstable for refusing the vaxxx? Well according to this they can be assesed and if found unwell, can be placed in an isolation facility. Please explain to me how opening the door for this is even remotely okay...</p>

        <p>I'm not shrugging it off but what your claiming and how its worded doesn't line up. It talks about involuntary commitals for mental health. I was a cop in California for 13 years (resigned like 3 months ago) and 5150 calls were like 25 percent of my job. A 5150 is an involuntary comittal for a person who is suicidal, violent, or gravely disabled which is what there describing. Your piecing together different things from different paragraphs and claiming the national guard will drag people out of their homes</p>

        <p>Well this sure as hell brings it one step closer huh? The time for temporary quarantine and isolation camps was last year early on in our response. There is no justifiable need for them today with the data we have. Yet alas, here we are...building isolation camps.... have you evr read the book 'the good german'? They thought there was no way their government could load ppl into boxcars and take them away...until they did....</p>
