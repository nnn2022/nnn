    <strong>To anyone that thinks masks aren‚Äôt about control and compliance</strong>
    <p><p>Think about the logic of openly denying and arguing with a maskless person. If the virus is so contagious and deadly, it would make sense to not engage with a maskless person at all. If a maskless person steps up to a counter expecting service, it would make the most sense (if you take this shit seriously) to do whatever you can to keep them from speaking and breathing in your direction. That would mean shut up, don‚Äôt engage, scan the items, and get them the fuck outta the store. That‚Äôs how it would be if people actually thought this was dangerous as opposed to just wanting to force compliance. That is why we constantly see videos of maskless people spending sometimes up to 15 minutes arguing about masks and then leaving before the police arrive. If it is to be believed what we are told by ‚Äúexperts,‚Äù than having as little interaction as possible is the best course of action. Arguing mask mandates, law, and policy for an extended period of time is nonsensical.</p></p>

        <p>Airborne diseases don't spread just by talking or breathing. They make you cough and sneeze so you're projecting particles. Mask is useless just cover your mouth if you cough, it's always been good manners anyway, sick or not.</p>

        <p>I've been saying the same shit. If y'all really cared about your health, you'd keep your head down and stay away and not engage. It's counterintuitive to engage somebody without a mask, inviting breath and spit in your general direction.</p>

        <p>I understand your point, but I think it's more that if they make it hard for you it's less likely for you to keep entering, I mean at some point you would probably get tired of arguing and leave and either start wearing a mask to enter, or goto a different store.</p>
<p>If they feel strongly about this they don't want to set a precedent that they will still serve you, because then most people won't bother, Ive seen that logic in children, if he doesn't need to wear a mask, why should I? Actually even beter, the guy with no mask is helped quicker, because they want them out the store asap.</p>
<p>That's probably the thinking.</p>

        <p>Oh I totally get it but it underscores the point that people don‚Äôt truly think it‚Äôs as deadly as they‚Äôre told it is. The media pretty much creates the idea that getting it and passing it along means a death sentence. If that were true than they‚Äôd be terrified to confront a maskless person. Instead, the push for compliance has been so great that I feel it‚Äôs more of a power trip. ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre not gonna wear one than I am not gonna serve you. I don‚Äôt care if you stand here and scream in my face for an hour, I‚Äôm not selling you Cheetos.‚Äù</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs not going to kill anybody to do it. Simple fact of the matter is that people still aren‚Äôt going to do it. So it‚Äôs up to the worker to either engage and deny, opening themselves up to prolonged exposure, or not say a word, complete the transaction swiftly and get them out.</p>

        <p>Still got them to leave, all while not enabling the behaviour. People are less likely to try it again if it already failed.</p>
<p>At least where I live, it's worked for the most part. Much less anti-mask behavior in stores and whatnot since there has been actual consequences for doing so.</p>

        <p>The majority of this sub is stupid. </p>
<p>If you shop somewhere that mandates masks and you don't wear a mask, you are being an asshole for no reason. You don't have to shop there. You are not entitled to their service for violating their rules. Shop somewhere else that doesn't ask for masks to be worn. It's not rocket science. If stores lose money because they are enforcing masks they will change policy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, government mask mandates are absolutely horseshit. The government is overstepping by requiring masks to be worn.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre missing the point. I don‚Äôt deny that I am an asshole. Unfortunately for the general public I and my fellow assholes exist. It‚Äôs not a matter of rights, it‚Äôs a matter of how dumb it is to refuse the service. Of course they can and often do. But my point is that if they believe this to be as deadly and contagious as they‚Äôre told it is, than it would behoove them to serve the asshole quickly so as to get them out of the store as fast as possible rather than deny them and engage in a worthless argument allowing said asshole to spew germs in the air, possibly infecting and killing countless grandmas.</p>

        <p>I know I am in the wrong. I‚Äôm still going to do it. Yes they have the right to not serve me. But assholes still exist. The incidents still happen. So, when such an incident presents itself, does it make more sense to make a point to refuse service, cause the customer to spew Covid around the store, or just get them checked out and exited the store?</p>
<p>Also, stores do not have the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. If I wanted to deny a customer because they‚Äôre black Id be shut down really fucking quick. And, the recent ruling that forced a Christian bakery to make cakes for gay marriages? Looks like you missed that era of history.</p>

        <p>You still don‚Äôt get it. I 100% agree with you. Stores have the right to refuse service to people for not wearing a mask. I‚Äôm not disputing that and I never did. All I was pointing out is that when that service is denied, emotions her high. If the denier is doing the denying because he or she is truly afraid of Covid, than they run the risk of being infected by the irate customer that refuses to leave the store as opposed to just serving the customer and getting them out of the door as fast as possible.

        <p>Why don't anti maskers just wear a mask and listen to the rules? If no one in forces a rule than no one will follow it. The reason these policy are needed for an extended period of time is because people won't wear masks</p>

<p>Also most of those websites in the post you link disprove your point</p>
<p>1) It's about influenza, not covid and the CDC now recommends wearing masks anyway.</p>
<p>2)The objective of the study is</p>
<p>"To  assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces  wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were  uncommon and not among recommended public health measures." basicly its about whether masks work in places where they aren't used often</p>
<p>3) The third one literally said it failed to come to a conclusion</p>
<p>4) In the recommendations section in says to wear a fucking mask</p>
<p>5) Appears to be leaning toward not needing masks, however the article is outdated and says we should wait for a study to conclude in south africa and that study concluded that you should wear a mask.</p>
<p>6)Look at the first paragraph under authers conclusions</p>
<p>7)Look at reason number 4 in the very first section about the articles being removed from the website</p>
<p>8)This article agrees with you</p>
<p>9)"<strong>Objective</strong> The aim of this study was to compare the  efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital healthcare workers  (HCWs). The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between  medical masks and cloth masks." quoted straight from the article lmao</p>
<p>also all of the posters quotes in the comment you linked are very very cherry picked lol</p>

        <p>I'll address your last point as it shows you have no idea what you are talking about. You quoted their objective as if it was the result of the trial. They were attempting to see if there was a difference between cloth and medical masks with the starting assumption that there was not. However the results of the trial showed that cloth masks were significantly inferior to medical masks.</p>
<p>&rt;Results The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</p>
<p>Also your point about evaluating flu is true for some of the trials but many of them including the BMJ trial discussed above use Influenza <strong>like</strong> illness as an endpoint which includes respiratory disease caused by coronaviruses.</p>
<p>&rt;Main outcome measure Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection.</p>
<p>Also even the latest observational study done by the CDC which I'm sure is heavily biased at this point since they have been touting them as nearly a panacea for the past year only found an association with a 1.8% case growth reduction.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm</p>
<p>I'd also like to see the rigorous study showing that masks have no adverse effects.</p>
<p>a taste of the CDC's bias.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/cdc-director-masks-better-than-vaccines-at-stopping-coronavirus-2020-9 </p>
<p>So again if you want to wear a mask by all means go ahead, but there is not nearly enough evidence to mandate them.</p>
<p>Edit: also many of your tv "experts" say that mask wearing is the reason why influenza dissappeared even though there is no evidence backing that claim. However using that same logic if masks eliminated influenza but not Covid then masks are less effective against Covid meaning that trials showing them ineffective against flu would imply they are even less effective against Covid.</p>

        <p>I quoted the objective to show that the study was trying to compare medical masks and cloth masks in <strong>health care workers</strong> not normal people doing normal things. Also of course medical masks are going to be better than cloth ones, I never said that wasn't true. Also the CDC article you linked is about restaurants in general. That CDC article also recommends you wear a mask. What "adverse effects" does wearing a mask have? I'm unsure what you were trying to prove with the business insider article. </p>
<p>In response to your edit influenza is less contagious than covid.</p>
<p>Also you didn't respond to any of the other articles I linked.</p>

        <p>You shills are so dishonest it's amazing, either that or you don't know how to read. The CDC study evaluated mask mandates AND restaurant reopenings, why would they evaluate masks mandates IN restaurants when people were always allowed to have their masks off when at the table, which is the majority of the time they are there. Again with the influenza, if all the RCTs show no effectiveness of masks in regards to Flu and Flu is less contagious than Covid then logic implies they would be even less effective against Covid. If you want me to respond to all your points please refrain from making ones that show you are a fucking shill or illiterate.</p>
<p>Edit: Also your point about it being in HCWs and not the community is another argument showing you are an idiot. HCWs are properly trained in PPE use, get fit tested and have better access to replacements when needed. HC settings should show greater efficacy than community settings.</p>

        <p>I think part of it may be that people don't care about mandates. Some people would have worn a mask before and the ones that woulden't have mostly don't care about any mandates. Aswell with the influenza, masks don't stop anything on their own. Increased hand washing and social distancing are part of it to. You are yet to explain why masks are so bad?</p>

        <p>If masks don't stop anything on their own then they don't have a use. People also tend to disregard the social distancing when they are masked so if anything they reduce the effectiveness of social distancing. In regards to hand washing, the predicate for community masking is using them as source control, washing your hands has no impact on what comes out of your mouth and nose so it could have no impact on the effectiveness of masks as source control. Again your arguments are flawed and you are showing you have no idea what you are talking about and are just spewing talking points from the Corporate Disease Center.</p>

        <p>masks help, they can't prevent disease on their own people need to do all three to really prevent disease. My arguments are fact based and I am spewing fact from the center for disease control. Literally everyone around the world says you are incorrect. You might be.

        <p>nobody has to follow any rules. We only have rules now because we agree they are good rules. We are the ones who create the rules, and we are the ones who decide whether they are rules. If we don't agree to them, then they're not really rules. When someone appears and tries to make us follow different rules, rules that are not our rules, this is called being under attack by an enemy.</p>

        <p>According to a CDC report, mask mandates only result in a 1.32% decrease in the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. </p>
<p>Meanwhile there have been more studies showing the effectiveness of Vitamin D in strengthening the immune system enough to prevent the illness. </p>
<p>We're not against stopping the spread, but we want a proper discussion on the proper methods that are effective. Not kneejerk reactions by politicians from a year ago that have been proven to be less than effective. I don't think this is unreasonable.</p>

        <p>I'd be curious to know if that report considered how effective the mandates were in actually getting people to wear them.</p>
<p>Just because people are being told to wear them, doesn't mean they actually are. Data matters.</p>

        <p>Mask compliance varies wildly depending on which region, but in my area it is extremely high and still we had a giant wave of new infections last winter.</p>
<p>Which is why I'm skeptical, and why I think the "one mask isn't enough, wear 2 now" is political backpedaling. Politicians never admit they were wrong, if something doesn't work they double-down 100% of the time. </p>
<p>Of course, it's possible that 1 mask is ineffective and 2 masks is effective, what I disagree with is the super heightened focus on masks. After 1 month of mask mandates, they should have seen the numbers didn't go down substantially at all, and switched to a new protocol, such as subsidized Vitamin D testing. If we keep trying the same thing over and over expecting different results, this madness will never end.</p>
