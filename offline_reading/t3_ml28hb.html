    <strong>Send them this the next time the vaccine cultists tell you "it's safe" and "le science and expurrrts"</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; Two issues are raising suspicions. The first is the unusual nature of the clots which, including low levels of platelets and rare antibodies in the blood that have been linked to other clotting disorders.
&rt; "This raises the possibility that the vaccine could be a causal factor in these rare and unusual cases of CVST, though we don't know this yet, so more research is urgently needed," said Prof David Werring, from the UCL Institute of Neurology.</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56620646</p>
<p>&rt; "Immune response may be linked to AstraZeneca vaccine clot issue; death risk rising among young adults in Brazil"</p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-science-idUSKBN2BL2R3 (deleted...)</p>
<p>&rt; Doctors are calling this “vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia” (VIPIT). VIPIT seems to be rare, occurring in anywhere from 1 in every 125,000 to 1 in 1 million people. </p>
<p>https://covid19-sciencetable.ca/sciencebrief/vaccine-induced-prothrombotic-immune-thrombocytopenia-vipit-following-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccination/ (One in a million, but there are more than twenty cases in 17M vaccinated people so it's 22000000/17000000 = 1.3 in a million. The same as covid in Thailand)</p>
<p>&rt; “Our theory that this is a powerful immune response most likely triggered by the vaccine, has been confirmed”, says professor and chief physician Pål Andre Holme. </p>
<p>https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510</p>
<p>The experts made a vaccine which caused an immune reaction that led to cases of thrombosis, leading to some countries discarding an entire batch (when the problem is the reaction to the vaccine itself, rather than a single defective batch). Either they did this on purpose, or they weren't qualified enough to prevent this outcome.</p>
<p>Say NO to mandatory vaccines, to vaccine passports, to ostracizing unvaccinated people and to peer pressure. If it only saves one life...</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. I felt this whole thing was an excuse from day 1. The new normal, great reset, the vaccine passports; they all confirmed my suspicions. Too bad I'm in Moronland, I wish I were in a town full of conscious people ready to fight totalitarianism armed to the teeth if necessary.</p>

        <p>America has baseball stadiums full of people, protests against the masks (which are optional)</p>
<p>Here people are just starting to take off their masks (restaurants, people walking in the street; even the leftists who pushed for the whole agenda don't wear them at their marches, but they blame it on us). It's not enough yet, but we're seeing some progress.</p>

        <p>I never gave a single thought to these "conspiracy theories" until uh around April 2020.  I woke up extremely fast. Now I don't believe SHIT, not even things from the last twenty years or so. I've seen some cringy "memories" of mine regarding gun rights since then. I'm so happy I woke up. </p>
<p>I saw my dentist recently. The hygienist was super interested in my opinion and said things like "Draconian" and "nothing makes sense". Then my dentist started telling me how the governor is getting thrown out and he can not wait. He also said "nothing makes sense". It was an uplifting day for me. I think I've only met one person this year who is a covid and covid "vaccine" worshipper. Everyone else is confused and not trusting the narrative.</p>

        <p>Good to see people are waking up; slowly but surely. The experts got it all wrong, the media was caught lying, the governments are being exposed... internet at work. Once you see and find out for yourself how one of the conspiracies is real, you'll be open to others. Once your mind is open, no truth is absolute, no source is infallible and everything has more than one side. Conspiracy is the basis of all politics.</p>
<p>That's why they want to ban "hate speech" so much. It'll end up just like on reddit; they banned "alt-right" and left communist , "fuck you karen", "white people do X", ANTIFA, etc. subreddits up and running.</p>
<p>Investigate more, regarding <em>certain events</em> that happened 20 years ago. Or a 100. Or more. The project for world goverment is old as fuck, and this is yet another step.</p>
