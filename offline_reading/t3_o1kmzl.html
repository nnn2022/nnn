        <p>If you're really committed to changing people's minds, you have to play to them. You have to recognize what they're saying, and let them know you understand it, but here's why you think this way.</p>
<p>For example, in the above, you could say something along the lines of "I get the research they've done over the last year or so has shown really promising results. But it still doesn't<em>insert point here and back it up with a link</em> "</p>
<p>You still might not change their mind, but they'll want to contribute more to the conversation just to prove you wrong. It's not about making them think you're right it's about making them understand that they need to do more thinking and researching on the topic. Otherwise, you're just trying to brainwash the brainwashed, and that's not very productive</p>

<p>There are literally people who can't have certain or any vaccines.  This is a proven fact.</p>
<p>For example, if you go get a flu vaccine, they will ask you if you have an egg allergy.  Why do you think that is?</p>

        <p>Show them this: </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">largest study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>

        <p>The mortality rate increases because with a COVID wave come lockdowns. Lockdowns cause <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/20/lockdown-developing-world-coronavirus-poverty/">a steep increase in poverty-related deaths</a>, increase <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/06/21/covid-19-lockdowns-cause-increase-in-alcohol-intake-oecd">alcoholism</a>, increase <a href="https://fee.org/articles/another-deadly-cost-of-covid-19-lockdowns-a-hidden-epidemic-of-drug-overdoses/">drug overdoses</a>, increase <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/lockdown-suicides-on-the-rise/">suicides</a>, and cause people to be <a href="https://www.wsmv.com/news/health/people-afraid-to-seek-medical-care-because-of-covid-19-fears/article_7e7e6650-e714-11ea-8c97-bf5db4e45ff4.html">afraid to seek timely medical care for treatable conditions</a>.</p>
<p>The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that many unvaccinated people are misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital, whereas far fewer vaccinated people are.</p>
<p>We haven’t seen a catastrophic level of adverse reactions yet simply because, as shown from the list of studies I linked, a lot of the adverse outcomes are not immediately apparent on getting the vaccine. If a lot of people had liver damage from it, yes, it would be apparent, but what about prion disease? That can take <a href="https://gizmodo.com/prion-disease-can-lurk-in-your-brain-for-30-years-befor-1823628617">years to develop</a>. And ADE only occurs in response to exposure to a strain of a disease that is not quite the same as the ones covered by the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The poverty article you linked discusses starvation in Africa. The mortality rates I linked are from the US. Deaths from suicide and drug overdoses are recorded as such, and don't account for anywhere near enough of the increased mortality. In fact, the suicide rate in the US <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778234">actually fell in 2020</a>. And nobody is going to be dying so rapidly in any significant numbers from increased alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>&rt;The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different</p>
<p>Wrong. Firstly, the study I linked was undertaken in Israel, not the US. Secondly, a positive result from a high Ct count isn't a 'false positive', it means you have a low viral load either because you've just caught it or have overcome it. The journalist who wrote that article literally <a href="https://twitter.com/apoorva_nyc/status/1301545759154802692?s=20">confirmed this</a>. Third, the link you posted confirms that the 28 count threshold is for determining whether a sample should be sent for sequencing by the CDC for possible variants, not for determining a positive test result.</p>
<p>&rt;what about prion disease?</p>
<p>Please tell me you're not relying on Classen's 'study'. There is zero evidence that the vaccines cause prion diseases. Given the rates of vaccination, there would be a causal link by now. They don't all take years to develop.</p>

        <p>I doubt they would ever realize it... There's a number of families that lost loved ones to the vaccine but they go on TV and they still encourage people to get it and say it's safe 🙄 and there are people who experience serious side effects that still defend it and tell people to get it. </p>
<p>I think many are so brainwashed there's nothing that will convince them otherwise. I call them lemmings.</p>

        <p>Whenever somebody asks me when I’m getting the experimental gene therapy, I respond with: “Would love to, but my doctor advised against me getting it”. Works every time.

        <p>For some reason my brain starts playing classical music and turns the reading voice in my head into a sophisticated British gentleman’s accent for the remainder of the comment whenever I read something like “go look at the science” or “safe and effective”.</p>
<p>It’s probably a coping mechanism to endure the stupidity of someone thinking they know what they are talking about by quoting the exact words they heard on TV the night before.</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter if you are an expert or some pleb glued to your TV, at this point in time there’s no possible way of knowing that “they are safe and effective” short of being a time traveler from the future.</p>
