    <strong>Big Business is and will be the primary enforcer of COVID tyranny in the US, not the government</strong>
    <p><p>There is a long history of governments (especially the US gov't) using private entities to further their insidious motives when doing so themselves would not be practical or politically expedient.</p>
<p>Just because it is not specifically the government doing something unethical does not mean that the government is not behind it, or at the very least complicit to it. It definitely does not preclude them from benefiting from it. </p>
<p>In some situations, corporations are indistinguishable from government. </p>
<p>In the following cases, private entities were responsible for unimaginable and incalculable harm on behalf of various governments. I have also included some of the specific crimes they perpetrated against innocents. </p>

<p>-Various governments (like the English Crown) permitted or encouraged piracy of foreign ships in the form of privateering </p>

<p>-The corporate state of the "Congo Free State" (as well as the ABIR Congo Company) in Belgian Congo led to the obscene torture, slavery, and genocide of over 10 million Congolese to provide cheap rubber for King Leopold and later the state of Belgium </p>

<p>-The privatized prison industrial complex plays a substantial role in modern day slavery on behalf of the US government </p>
<p>Source: https://sites.tufts.edu/prisondivestment/the-pic-and-mass-incarceration/ </p>
<p>-The Convict Lease System in post-Civil War southern states directly led to the unjust incarceration of (mostly black) men who committed minor or arbitrary offenses such as loitering. </p>
<p>They were then shipped out against their will to work extremely dangerous and physically intensive jobs for the profit of wealthy business owners. In some situations, over one out of every four of those men shipped out was killed on the job, and their families were irreparably harmed. </p>
<p>Slavery was illegal in the new South, but this unholy alliance of the penal system and industry kept it going on for decades after the Civil War to the benefit of both big business and the government. </p>
<p>For example, in 1898, the state of Alabama received 73% of it's yearly revenue from the Convict Lease System. It profited enormously by allowing business to continue the evil system of slavery that had been ended only a couple of decades earlier. </p>

<p>-Racial segregation in the US South was both de jure and de facto. </p>
<p>The government enforced it to an extent through segregated public facilities (such as schools,) but private businesses and individuals were substantially responsible for ensuring that black Americans could not participate in Southern society and were therefore a permanent underclass. </p>
<p>These white individuals and business owners claimed that it was their "right to serve whom they choose," and largely locked black Americans out of mainstream life.</p>
<p>Housing covenants prevented the sale of real estate to non-white individuals. </p>
<p>Black Americans were not permitted to work any jobs except the most dangerous, menial, low-paid, and least respected ones.</p>
<p>Black Americans would not receive service at many restaurants, hotels, gas stations, stores, or a variety of other essential businesses. </p>
<p>While government provided the legal framework to support segregation, and definitely was responsible for it to an extent, it was mostly private businesses and individuals that led to the constant and ever-present harm it caused to black Southerners.</p>

<p>-Apartheid in South Africa was strongly enforced by private interests as well as the government. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the support of Apartheid from industry permitted the white minority government to continue oppressing the black South African population.</p>
<p>To quote former Apartheid-era South African prime minister John Vorster, "Each bank loan, each new investment is another brick in the wall of [the white minority rule government's] continued existence."</p>

<p>Tyranny does not necessarily have to be enforced by the government. Corporations can serve as surrogates for government interests and commit the exact same atrocities. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in America, many of us blindly fetishize successful businesses and businessmen without ever giving thought to the ethics of those individuals/organizations or the implications of the extreme concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a select few. </p>
<p>We are taught from a young age that anything short of a kleptocratic oligarchy is communism or socialism, and therefore bad. </p>
<p>We are taught that people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, the Waltons, Warren Buffet, and others are virtuous as a result of their wealth. </p>
<p>We are indoctrinated with the just world fallacy and are told that if those individuals and mega-corporations were not good, the free market would have weeded them out long ago and made them go broke. Ergo, the opposite is also true - they must be morally upstanding. </p>
<p>We worship billionaires and big business in the US. Yet, we have to believe that those things are the result of the superiority of unrestrained crony capitalism and the "free market," and not primarily the natural progression of intergenerational wealth. </p>
<p>To keep the masses content with the systemic subjugation and pillaging of the working class to the benefit of the elites, we must also believe that any of us could one day become a billionaire CEO. </p>
<p>Despite the fact that almost all massively-wealthy people in the US were not born into poor or working-class families, this falsehood is still frequently promulgated. </p>
<p>This is where we see the odd appeals to "private business," when in fact there are almost no true large-scale "private businesses" in the US. </p>
<p>We are fed the lie that small, independent businesses control the lion's share of commerce in this country, when the truth is that they do not in most industries. </p>
<p>Read enough comments on social media about vaccine passports being mandatory to enter a store, and you will hear some variation of, "a business owner can deny service to whoever he pleases. Free market at work, baby." </p>
<p>When someone tells you that a business owner has a right to determine who can or cannot associate with them and patronize their establishment, they conjure up an image of a working-class small business owner with a unique and highly personal/intimate operation (such as making artistic commissions like a special cake) determining whether or not he agrees with an idea that he will be forced to condone should he engage in business with an individual. </p>
<p>Most of us agree with the right of a small businessman to turn away potential customers. Given that many small businesses operate on rather small profit margins, they would not last long if they started arbitrarily denying service to people. </p>
<p>It is not really a concern - and in any situation, you can simply patronize another establishment if one individual business wants to deny service.</p>
<p>In truth, that is not who is going to be denying services to those who do not follow pandemic measures. It will be the large corporate entities that control nearly every aspect of business in this country. </p>
<p>If all the major grocery stores were told by the government that vaccine passports were necessary to implement, they would do it instantly. Anyone who did not have one would be going without essentials. </p>
<p>Some will say, "well, that's the free market at work. Don't like it? Start your own business or go somewhere that agrees with you." </p>
<p>That is a completely implausible solution to this issue. </p>
<p>The first problem is that pretty much every major corporation moves in lockstep with what the government-backed pro-pandemic measures in-group desires. </p>
<p>These for-profit companies will want to appeal to the largest group of potential customers - and once the vast majority of people have been vaccinated, wear masks, have vaccine passports, etc, those people will want to shop in a place that rewards them for their obedience to those measures. </p>
<p>These major corporations will implement measures to entice those people to patronize their establishment. They will proclaim that they have disease-free stores where one could shop without concern about mingling with the "unclean." </p>
<p>If it were just your mom-and-pop stores acting like this, it would not be a big deal. The issue is that major corporations will be the ones behind this, and at this point, one could argue that they are no longer private enterprises (especially if they are publicly-traded) but rather essential infrastructure that should not be permitted to deny service to anyone. </p>
<p>Just like your power company (which in many states is granted a legal monopoly and other special privileges by the government) cannot deny you service or turn off your heat/cooling and electricity during the winter/summer months even if you are unable to pay, "essential business" should not be permitted to deny service to anyone for any reason. </p>
<p>Companies like Walmart were allowed to flaunt pandemic closures that decimated small business. </p>
<p>If they are treated as "essential" public utilities that are not subject to the normal laws and regulations of industry, they should no longer be considered "private business" that can be run as they see fit. </p>
<p>Mom-and-pop stores were deemed nonessential and shuttered to "stop the spread," yet big business leveraged it's massive wealth, power, and influence to keep their doors open even though the risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus is arguably greater in a place where more people can congregate. </p>
<p>Walmart was "essential business" that was so critical to our society functioning that it was legally exempt from COVID rules. </p>
<p>Are they really "private business" if they have government mandates buttressing their profit margins and protecting their business interests while real private business is forced to tank during a pandemic? </p>
<p>They sold the exact same goods as many small businesses, and were given an unfair advantage by the government that ended up running many of their smaller competitors out of business. </p>
<p>And this is to speak nothing of the fact that our tax dollars permit them to pay their workers starvation wages. By subsidizing their workers through welfare, we allow companies like Walmart to not have to pay their workers a living wage. The owners can then pocket the difference and enrich themselves. </p>
<p>They are not private business, they are not a part of the "free market," they should not have the ability to deny service to "whoever they please," and they engage in government-sanctioned monopolistic behavior that any non-corrupt Department of Justice would have enacted antitrust measures against. </p>
<p>As an example - Walmart has a stranglehold on our food supply in this country. According to a study by the Institute of Local Self Reliance, Walmart alone captures at least 50% of the grocery market in 204 different metropolitan areas. In 38 of those, Walmart has a greater than 70% share of the grocery market. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Walmart "receives 25 cents out of every dollar spent on groceries" in the US as a whole. </p>
<p>In 1944, the A&amp;P supermarket chain only controlled 16% of the grocery market before being hit with antitrust lawsuits by the DoJ. Then, it was forced to split into multiple smaller companies, each with substantially less market share and influence. </p>
<p>Why is Walmart able to avoid such sanctions when they quite clearly control way too much of the market for such essential goods? </p>
<p>Because our current government does not protect the interests of the public. They protect the interests of big business, and the corollary is that big business protects the interests of the government in turn. </p>
<p>Source: https://ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Walmart_Grocery_Monopoly_Report-_final_for_site.pdf </p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, Walmart is just one company. Surely, you could patronize another major supermarket chain if they denied you service. </p>
<p>Oh wait: it will not just be Walmart doing this. All the rest of the major grocers such as Target, Whole Foods, Kroger, Aldi's, Publix, Meijers, and others will require vaccine passports as well once they are encouraged or required to do so by the government. </p>
<p>In many areas, you would be left with literally nowhere to purchase food if these corporations all followed the same instructions from the government and denied you service. </p>
<p>Is this the "free market?" When there is only one corporation to buy essentials from, and the alternative to not purchasing those essentials is eventual death, is it really a free market, or is a rather large degree of coercion involved? </p>
<p>When they have been given preferential treatment by the government (such as tax breaks, subsidies, exemption from pandemic measures, etc.) and bankrupted every last bit of independent business in an area (cough, Walmart in rural places, cough,) are you really free to "vote with your dollar" and find somewhere else that has similar ideology to you? </p>
<p>Or is the truth that government and big business are one in the same, and the government does not want to be seen as the face of tyranny and coercion in a country that is generally untrusting of the government but praises laissez-faire capitalists regardless of how corrupt they are? </p>
<p>In terms of the common argument about "you can always start your own business if you don't want a vaccine passport. Something something free market something something cake shop ruling," it is completely and unequivocally false. </p>
<p>It is not as simple as start your own store. Let's say that you decide to go that route. Here is what you will have to deal with. </p>
<p>You will have to come up with the money up front to purchase a facility. Relying on renting is not good enough when people will not want to (or cannot) conduct business with you. And guess what - that's not cheap. </p>
<p>You will also have to negotiate and pay for insurance for the facility, as well as countless other administrative costs. </p>
<p>Next, you will have to negotiate deals on every last item that you wish to carry in your store. </p>
<p>You will have to contact distributors, find ones that will be willing to trade with you (in a world where adherence to pandemic measures is mandatory,) and you will have to create a supply chain to bring the products to your facility. </p>
<p>Realistically, if it ever got to the point where every major business hopped on the "agree with pandemic measures or else" train, you would be screwed on all of that. </p>
<p>You would have to be a vertically integrated company that controls the entire supply chain for every last one of your products. </p>
<p>You would have to own the farms that grow the food, own all of the equipment (and not just rent it, like how most large farm equipment is required to be used nowadays,) own machinery or other tools to package the food and ensure that it is safe to eat, own the trucks to take it to your store, own an oil rig and refinery to create the fuel needed to power your machinery, and own the building itself as well as have the means of providing your own water and power for all of this. </p>
<p>You would have to come up with financing for this venture as well. </p>
<p>It could not be obtained by becoming a publicly-traded company - the risk of shareholders demanding adherence to government-encouraged measures to curry favor with consumers and increase profit would be too high, and you would lose the ability to truly control your company. </p>
<p>You would also have to find companies and individuals that would be willing to become pariahs and trade with you. This will be no easy feat. </p>
<p>This will be even more true should the government tie a vaccine passport to your bank accounts. </p>
<p>At the moment, Mastercard is involved with making vaccine credentials. It is not much of a leap to assume that they will one day tie your finances to this document. </p>
<p>Source: https://www.paymentssource.com/news/mastercard-brings-tech-and-scale-to-vaccination-passport-projects </p>
<p>Then, after all of this, you are going to have to find the very small amount of people that will still not be subordinate to pandemic measures and will want to patronize your business. </p>
<p>You are going to have to find a way to reach them and advertise your store, but Big Tech which controls nearly all social media (and that is to say nothing of the monopoly on traditional media by certain corporations) will likely ban you once they find out what you are doing. </p>
<p>They will claim it is "misinformation" or some other garbage. </p>
<p>To summarize, the idea of "just make your own business, it's the free market, bro" is unfeasible. </p>
<p>No individual that wasn't already a billionaire would be able to do that if he were blacklisted from trading with major corporations. </p>
<p>This whole "free market" fantasy of those in favor of pandemic measures is just that - a fantasy. </p>
<p>We do not have a free market in the US. Our government and big business are one and the same. </p>
<p>How else could one explain the fact that social media companies, grocery stores, internet providers, power/water companies, etc. are all permitted to engage in monopolistic practices without being investigated and punished for antitrust violations? </p>
<p>I am no Republican, but it is deeply troubling that during the end of former President Trump's term, I had no way of staying informed as to what he had to say. I usually did not agree with what he would post, but it is scary that he could be so easily removed from public view. </p>
<p>Social media uniformly acted to silence the sitting President of the United States because they deemed him to be harmful. If they have enough power to silence the leader of the free world, they have too damn much power. </p>
<p>If they can determine that someone as powerful as the then-sitting multi-billionaire president should not be allowed to be heard, and have the capability to keep him from communicating with his constituents, they are engaging in monopolistic behavior. </p>
<p>If all the major social media networks act uniformly to suppress speech, and can prevent the goddamn president from being heard, how can anyone say with a straight face that they do not have a monopoly? </p>
<p>Where is the DoJ cracking down on our modern-day Standard Oils or AT&amp;T's? At most, they accuse a company like Microsoft of engaging in monopolistic behavior when it steps so far out of line that it cannot be swept under the rug. Yet they will do nothing to actually break the company up or severely punish it. </p>
<p>The current government does not care about the people. They will conspire with big business left and right, and permit them to do every manner of awful act. </p>
<p>Those who say "free market" or "start your own business" do not legitimately believe in either of those. They know deep down that there is no free market, and it would be next to impossible to start your own business and compete with major corporations, especially at scale. </p>
<p>Something must be done about all of this. Personally, I believe that the only way forward is to obtain the means of survival (arable land, seeds, potable water, shelter, tools, instruments of self-defense, etc) and form communities that will not tolerate the evil being foisted onto all of us. </p>
<p>Starting your own business to stand up to the powers that be, like I described in this post, is a fool's errand. For an individual, it will simply not possible in the near future. </p>
<p>Forming your own community right now is, however. Finding like like-minded individuals and living according to what you know to be right is doable. </p>
<p>In any regard, remember this: if you cannot grow your own food, if you do not have access to your own water supply, if you do not own the place you live in, and if you do not have the means to defend yourself, you are at the mercy of whoever provides those things to you. </p>
<p>We must all realize something - this world does not care about any of us. Some of us have known this for a long time, some are just now realizing it, and some have not yet awakened to this reality. </p>
<p>Many of the people in your life will turn on you if exposed to the right conditions. Propaganda and constant fear can lead to even intelligent, good, loving people becoming twisted monsters that would do terrible things to those they used to care about. </p>
<p>If you are not self sufficient, you will never truly have control over your destiny, and you will forever be controlled by the puppet masters pulling the strings of all those who cannot or will not act for themselves.</p></p>

        <p>Is not the use of private enterprise and business to do the dirty work of enforcing government propagated tyranny a definition of fascism?</p>

        <p>Have a 💯 in lieu of a paid award. Excellent insight, and you did a great job of laying bare the numerous shortcomings of the 'free' market, which most creators I otherwise enjoy have a tendency to dismiss. They think 'capitalism' is the opposite of woke entitled SJW bullshit and thus a perfect system based on meritocracy which never fails and is impervious to corruption, or at least that's the impression I'm left with after listening to them. But as you point out, when unlevel playing fields, special treatment, and high level collusion between gov and corps is established, these companies essentially <em>are</em> the state at that point.</p>
<p>Anyway, fuck Tyranny. Whether private, public, or whatever it may be.</p>
