    <strong>Veterans not able to visit Washington DC unless they get the Covid vaccine or until this rule is lifted (If they don't want the vaccine), this is insanity.</strong>
    <p><p>So I dropped my wife off at work, headed home, and turned on my classic rock radio station. I was just hoping to either hear music or a morning shock jock. Nope, they're talking about pushing vaccines on people and how people aren't vaccinated. They were also talking about how to get people who don't want the vaccine to get the vaccine. This is all normal shit these days so I just ignored it, and right when I was about to turn the radio off I heard this and it pissed me off. There's some sort of program that lets Veterans visit Washington DC on Memorial Day, it's a free flight for veterans. The only requirement is that you get vaccinated! This is disgusting. We aren't even letting our own veterans visit monuments and memorials for their services if they don't want to get vaccinated. It's bad enough that we have stopped respecting our veterans, but this is really fucking bad. They did mention that there will be another flight but only after that covid vaccination rule is lifted, which might not be until sometime in June. June. PAST memorial day. So veterans that don't want the vaccine will have to wait until after memorial day to go visit these sites. I'm really starting to get sick of this shit.</p></p>

        <p>Just remember - all these little indignities are to keep you outraged.   As long as you are outraged, you're not thinking.</p>
<p>They are playing a long game.   While we fume about masks and lockdowns and vaccines, they are already planning the shifts in currency and food production.   They are already planning on rationing energy.</p>
<p>There is more to come, if they have their way.</p>

        <p>Remember, if they can do that to our veterans now, imagine what they have in store for us people who are aNtI-vAxXeRs and AnTi-ScIeNcE!</p>
<p>They know people are waking up to the bullshit, so before they stop the vaccine nonsense, they're going to go all out to get as many people to get their toxic sludge for the "right" to visit these monuments.</p>
<p>I predict if you want to go to a national park, or visit any federal monuments or areas, you need the vaccine. I know, I know, I shouldn't give these morons orchestrating this non-sense any ideas, but this kind of nonsense is coming our way.</p>

        <p>If the ccp model is any accurate glimpse of what is to come, and I believe it is... well, look at the falun gong practitioners...</p>
<p>Their great crime of wrongthink is promoting a spirituality that does not include the state as the most holy divinity, and they are put in concentration camps, used in medical experiments, and the reason why ebay made the policy against selling human parts on its site.  </p>
