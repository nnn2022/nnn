    <strong>What is the endgame for Australia?</strong>
    <p><p>Australia, the envy of the world. No more. As half the population enters yet another strictly enforced lockdown, are the Aussies beginning to scratch their head at this zero COVID elimination policy?</p>
<p>Even with high vaccination rates, the vaccines do not prevent the spread of the disease and therefore the country must be prepared to accept an influx of cases and a significant number of overinflated deaths in the future.</p>
<p>I understand that Australia can only view the pandemic through the lens of the media, portrayed as apocalyptic in countries such as the USA and the UK. The fear is heightened, the behavioral science at peak levels when in stark reality things aren't as bad over in the UK/US in terms of mortality regardless of what the propaganda presents.</p>
<p>Do Aussies agree that a small amount of death is a price worth paying for liberty?</p>
<p>Or do they continue to play cat and mouse, eat up the propaganda and enter a vicious cycle of lockdown from a minute number of cases for the foreseeable?</p></p>

        <p>You’ll end up like mad Max, where your own people fight against its government. I know nukes were involved in the films but I don’t believe in them. One would of been used by now, if they was real. Mini nukes have been used and people now live there, so I don’t they are real for that reason. Also your country’s seems to never want tourists again but a lot of the world is the same. The elites can grab what ever they like whist the world is in constant lock down. Gold, diamonds, gas and plenty of other money making things.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who thinks the only answer is vaccination, lockdowns and hard borders. He only watches the news on TV. He’s a great yardstick to figure out what’s going on with the general population.
Based on this observation and many others, I think we’re fucked in Australia.</p>
<p>The rest of the world should be paying more attention to Australia as we are at the forefront of this.</p>
<p>Please send help!</p>
