    <strong>Thanksgiving Message From Pam Popper</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone\~</p>
<p>I just received this email letter from Pam Popper, and thought I'd share it. She is a strong person and I appreciate her views as we come up on our locked down holiday here in the US:</p>
<p><strong>Choices About Thanksgiving Celebrations</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Pamela A, Popper, President</strong><br>
<strong>Wellness Forum Health</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Thursday is Thanksgiving, a holiday we usually look forward to. We gather with friends and family, allow ourselves a few dietary indiscretions, enjoy a glass of wine, and thank God for our blessings. Typically, at least at gatherings I’ve attended, we’ve expressed thanks for living in the greatest country in the world and all of the benefits associated with this – such as freedom of speech and religion, the ability to assemble, and protection against unreasonable search and seizure.</strong><br>
This Thanksgiving is different. Most of us have lost many of our rights. Our speech is censored. Many churches and synagogues are closed. We are told how many people are "allowed" to gather at the dinner table. And the state will be watching us to make sure we comply. Snitches are encouraged to call and report anyone who breaks any of the "rules" – which change from day to day and in some areas are downright ridiculous.<br>
In Ohio we no longer have a governor, we have an emperor who has declared himself above the law and demonstrated time and time again that he’s an inhumane sociopath. For example, just a few months ago, he denied a request for both parents to be with their dying eight-year-old at the same time in a hospital. The Emperor DeWine’s Thanksgiving rules are mild compared to this, but clear in their intent: Turn the people against one another, and make sure that everything that matters in life – family, fun, camaraderie, hugs, singing, dancing, enjoyment – is forbidden.<br>
I’ve come to expect this from the emperor – we are somewhat used to his insane proclamations now. But what I cannot fathom is what makes people decide to impose ridiculous rules on their own friends and family. I’m appalled at some of the Thanksgiving invitations people have forwarded to me, and this one is a good example: <br>
Hi to everyone. We would like to follow CDC guidelines as much as possible for Thanksgiving gatherings, and this is what we propose.  Prior to Thanksgiving:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We should all minimize contact with people outside our own households in the 6 days leading up to Thanksgiving.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If we must interact with anybody, we need to be scrupulous about observing the 3 Ws:  Wear your mask, Watch your distance, Wash your hands.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Try to note whether the people you're interacting with are in a high-risk group for transmitting the virus (eg. students, or people who are cavalier about wearing masks and taking other precautions).</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you have the ability to get tested before Thanksgiving day, that would be great.</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p>On Thanksgiving Day:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There will just be the four of us.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The weather indicates some rain, though the percentage has dropped since a few days ago.  Not sure we can bank on good weather, so we're likely to be eating indoors.  To be confirmed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bring a small, personal bottle of hand sanitizer that only you handle, and of course your regular mask.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will provide brand new full face shields, allowing us to see each other's faces, lip read (making conversations easier), and even eat with the shield on if desired.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will keep environmental noise down (music included) so that nobody needs to raise a voice to speak -- loud speaking is not safe, but the face shields will help.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will open up our dining table to its full size so that we can spread out.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will open windows, and set fan space heaters around to both warm us and move air around.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We will have other heating on of course, and put the big ceiling fan on for additional air circulation.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear warm clothing other than a coat so that you can sit comfortably without being in anything too bulky.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid putting anything on the dinner table that is not part of the dinner (phones, keys, purses, other personal items, etc.)</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Sanitize hands before handling things touched by more than one person (serving spoons and dishes).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Both bathrooms are of course available for washing hands, and we'll have clean towels in them.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If anyone has other ideas to make this a great but safe occasion, please share them with us. We want to have a good time. Won't it be fun to get together again!  It's been a long time.</strong><br>
<strong>Won’t it be fun? Are you kidding me? First, one has to "qualify" to attend this dystopian dinner that seems more like a scene in a science fiction movie than a holiday celebration. After qualifying, one earns the privilege of sitting in a cold room with a face shield and being asked to use hand sanitizer after touching anything. This sounds like as much fun as having a root canal without any anesthetic.</strong><br>
<strong>But the issue is much more important than the ridiculousness of it all. Our emperors and empresses do not care about us; they are despots who only care about maintaining power and control over us. People who follow their instructions are no better than they are. Social distancing and eating on the porch and wearing shields and avoiding all contact at a gathering of family and/or friends is not a sign of caring. It has nothing to do with health, and it’s cruel. And it’s particularly cruel at a time when what we all need is familiarity, to experience closeness, to demonstrate love for one another, and to form a united front against the enemy - a government that is trying to destroy all of us.</strong> <br>
<strong>Your decisions concerning this holiday make a statement about what you think is right. Going along to get along is the path of least resistance. But if you choose to participate in this nonsense, there will most certainly be more of it. Actions speak louder than words and your compliance shows the world that "This is ok with me." This empowers our rulers to wreak more and more havoc with our lives. After all, they got the idea to do what they are doing now because, so far, they’ve been getting away with it.</strong><br>
<strong>The purpose of this editorial is to point out that the decisions we make really do matter, particularly right now. We’re in a fight for our way of life; one that we can only win if we have the strength of character to say "Enough. No more." The despots regularly remind us that "We are in this together." The question now is "Together with which group?" The despots or the resistance? The choice is yours.</strong></p></p>

        <p>Apparently, this is an example of some of the invitations people are getting. Someone mailed this to her. At least, that's what I gather from the letter.</p>
<p>On her YT channel, she often shares emails and comments and stories that people send her.</p>

        <p>Not the OP, but this is must read material even if it's long!</p>
<p>If i wasn't personally active in anti NWO fight, i'd dismiss it ,like a bad joke, but unfortunately it's not. If you'd tell that humano-phobic host, that this is how he/she's gonna be treating his guests eight moths ago, he'd be LOLing like crazy and block u in a heartbeat. </p>
<p>It's depressing. I've read that it takes about 10-20yrs for major societal changes to take effects  in the populous ,but it takes like 6 months when they are scared shitless. I wonder what's so great in those sheeple's lives ,that they are so paranoid of the flu ,which can most likely kill them only in theory (unless old or sick from before).</p>
