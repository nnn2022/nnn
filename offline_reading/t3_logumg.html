    <strong>Theory about current suspended and slow vaccination</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccination is currently suspended or very slow on most countries (US, most Europe, Australia,...)</p>
<p>I may be getting on conspiracy with this post, but I am curious about your opinion on my theory.</p>
<p>I was thinking about what could be slowing the vaccination to this rate. Media have been blaming the weather or slow production, but what I learnt this past 5 years is that Media never tells the complete truth.</p>
<p>So I was thinking about it and I came to conclusion that they are slowing down so we do not notice the excess of deaths from the vaccines in the mortality statistics. What I mean is, they want to avoid spikes or noticeable anormalities in the data.</p>
<p>However, the data can still be manipulated, so it may not be it.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p></p>

        <p>As someone working in marketing, my theory is that they’re making use of one of the oldest selling tactics out there. The scarcity principle. </p>
<p>In a nutshell it’s this: more people want something than there’s current supply of. Withhold the vaccines long enough to increase the number of people wanting to get vaccinated (rise in demand through artificially created scarcity). Then sprinkle in the msm fear mongering campaigns to ‘market’ the benefits of the product while ‘de-bunking’ the vaccine deaths and the ‘conspiracy theorists’. As a result, you’ll see a run on the vaccine as they miraculously find a way to scale up the production. The goal of all this is to achieve a max percentage of the population who’ll be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Also. As long as it’s not available to the majority of the population, fewer people will notice a potential spike in deaths caused by the vaccine (it’ll get declared as covid death anyway). At this very moment, this gained time can be used by governments to push vaccine mandates and passports.</p>
<p>But.. I might as well just be paranoid, who knows.</p>

        <p>Haha thanks. Even my 75 yo grandma (who’s run a business her whole life) brought up that the media and the government make use of the scarcity principle. She didn’t use that exact wording but she described it perfectly and called it a stupid ‘no brainer’ strategy to increase the % of vaccinated people.</p>
<p>She can’t understand why not more people see that.</p>

        <p>This!!! Even though someone I know easily got both shots, she still acted like it was a prize because "they're hard to get". They really aren't if you're edit in healthcare or fit the other criteria.</p>

        <p>They need time to design post-pandemic all-reset world. Bureaucrats are slow and inefficient, they can't do it too fast. Also, they don't want rapid and uncontrolled reopening, so they are more comfortable with a trickle. Vaccine side effects are also a possibility: even 2% of people having serious side effects is way too many patients for them, they explained us already that treating us is a hassle they can't be bothered with.</p>
<p>Vaccines can also be genuinly hard to make. There is a reason we didn't have common cold vaccine before.</p>

        <p>The reason we don't have common cold vaccines is because they keep on trying to do a "One vaccine to rule (thwart) them all!" scheme with the common cold.</p>
<p>You cannot do that with a virus that has literal THOUSANDS of different strains.</p>

        <p>here you can see they are already check-mate!</p>
<p>they risk too many people waking up when they push too hard and slowing down wont bring their plans to fruition. everyday more people are waking up and its a one-way ticket, this number is only increasing faster and faster.</p>
<p>so yeah, we have won guys! it is litterally save to say at this point. give it  a few more months and this whole system will be taken down.</p>
