        <p>It's "unique" because it's man made. Injection sites so it can manipulated and changed as needed. We are nothing but cattle to the powers that be and they believe it's time for a slaughter.</p>

        <p>I'm other words we don't know what exactly it is because we have never isolated and purified it.</p>

        <p>Who fact checks the fact checkers? Anyway, you will see several claims of isolating covid 19. However it has never been purified (broken down to a state where it is completely on its own). If you actually read the papers that claim to have isolated it, they use the term "in-silico genome" which means they have basically made it up. We are then shown a picture which could be anything and told it is the virus!</p>
<p>Think about it, why, in an event like this, has there not been an in depth programme to show the ins and outs of isolation and purification? It's top secret and it's that way for a reason. </p>
<p>So I urge everyone to look in depth at the studies or get someone you know who has an idea about this type of process as I can guarantee you it has not been isolated and purified in the way that proves this virus exists.</p>
