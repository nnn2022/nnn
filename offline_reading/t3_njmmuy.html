    <p><p>In reality, these formulas that are being administered were developed 10, 20, 30, or possibly even more years ago, deep behind the curtains of the military industrial complex and likely methodically studied such that our overlords would know exactly what the effects would be. There's no source to back this up - it's just basic common sense that anyone who's IQ exceeds 96.35 can ascertain. </p>
<p>The elites do not leave anything to chance. Any major initiative is carefully thought out and tested for years and years before it is finally put into practice - that's how they do business. </p>
<p>Propaganda is the meat to any psychological warfare operation, but reverse psychology is the potatoes of it all. When we feed into their narrative of these poisons having been produced in the timeline that they say they have, we are allowing "them" to box us in exactly where they want us so that they can later come and discredit us in one fell swoop.</p></p>
