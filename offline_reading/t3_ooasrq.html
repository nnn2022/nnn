    <strong>My friend's heart inflation from Pfizer</strong>
    <p><p>My friend, who is just a regular young and healthy male, was not feeling well after taking the Pfizer clotshot. He went to the hospital and all the results showed he had myocarditis. The EKG showed his heart's erratic behavior, and the other tests also pointed to heart inflation. He showed me a picture of him in a hospital bed connected to machines with an IV in his arm and he was there for a few days.</p>
<p>I am definitely pissed about these poisonous inoculations. I couldn't warn everyone, but I tried. I am annoyed at the people telling me that if I convince someone not to get the shot and they die of COVID then I am responsible. (Well how about if you tell someone to get the shot and they die...?) And the people telling me that (even though they agree with me on most things and don't care if I don't get vaccinated,) I am just as bad as those pushing the COVID agenda because I am pushing my own agenda (that the "vaccines" are not safe). Well I am just trying to spread some facts about the side effects of the shots. A friend (an EMT) told me and my friend that COVID can give heart inflation too. I told him that if one takes the "vaccine", then they are putting that stuff strait into their body and definitely increasing their chances of this happening because that is one of the symptoms of the "vaccine". Also I didn't see any news stories about people getting heart inflation from COVID, but I have seen many news stories of people getting heart inflation from the shot...</p></p>

        <p>Some people on the "normie" subs try to say that stories like this are lies, when these are well-known side effects of the vaccine, no matter how rare they want to say they are. I'm sorry about what happened to your friend.</p>

        <p>It's going to dribble out bit by bit, I think. I think they wanted everyone to get these vaccines before the truth could come out.</p>

        <p>So sorry to hear that this has happened. They'll need to report it to VAERS/MRHA Yellowcard. Ensure he's getting the best medical help. Hope for the best. You're fighting a losing battle if you try and convince others. Just tell them to be careful in case they have pre-existing heart troubles. The media is too strong. You're labelled an antivaxxer if you even try and say anything. Bit that doesn't mean you can't offer comfort if anything does go wrong.
How's he feeling?</p>

        <p>I stopped trying to convince others, I will just let people do what they want.</p>
<p>He is out of the hospital and he seems mostly fine, but he has some cough because of it. He was told not to play sports and other activities which would affect heart rate.</p>

        <p>Covid causes spike proteins to circulate in your body in a certain quantity. They can cause severe damage. The clotshots make your body produce spike proteins in even larger numbers and distribute them all throughout your body and make them bind to cell walls. So both you and your EMT friend are right. Only one of you is being reasonable though.</p>
