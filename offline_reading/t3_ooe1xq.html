        <p>sadly i think many even those who are free thinkers donâ€™t know much about ivermectin. Dark Horse podcasts are a great source of info, i find it all incredibly fascinating</p>

<p>Academic Articles:</p>
<p>Journal article from 2004 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2004/12/sars-vaccine-linked-liver-damage-ferret-study</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15755610/</p>
<p>Journal article from 2005 shows evidence that sars-cov1 vax caused ADE when subjects were challenged with different strain:
https://www.nature.com/articles/news050110-3#ref-CR1</p>
<p>Journal article from 2012 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov1 vaccine:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035421</p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 on autoimmune disorders from Sars-cov vaccine (can't figure out if they're talking about cov1 or 2):
https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672.abstract</p>
<p>Article explaining how ADE works in Sar-cov1:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Article explaining the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2538-8</p>
<p>Another article that speculates on the potential for ADE in Covid19:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32920233/</p>
<p>Article from 2021 explains that there is evidence that covid19 is able to kill macrophages by using antibody dependent mechanisms:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.22.432407v1 </p>
<p>Journal article from 2020 explains why immune disorders happen with covid vax, because human and Covid19 proteins are similar:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589909020300186</p>
<p>Article on how the Covid19 spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096999612030406X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Japanese article on how the Pfizer vax is associated with brain hemorrhaging (lending credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40545-021-00326-7</p>
<p>Article on how AstraZeneca is associated with blood clots in the brain (lending more credence to the hypothesis that the spike proteins are crossing the blood brain barrier in some people):
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840</p>
<p>Pfizer animal testing document that was obtained by Dr. Byram Bridle through a FOI request to the Japanese government which shows the biodistribution of the lipid-nano particles throughout the bodies and organs of the test subjects. This is evidence that the lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the injecton site, but instead travel all throughout the body (go to pg 16/23 for the charts showing biodistribution over the course of 48hrs):
https://files.catbox.moe/0vwcmj.pdf</p>
<p>Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell:

<p>Article with evidence that spike proteins do end up circulating in the blood, when they're not supposed to, they're supposed to be anchored on the cell membranes:
