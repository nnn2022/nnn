    <strong>We are at the point where the vaccines are being used as a vehicle to remove internet freedom.</strong>
    <p><p>This is how we know this has gone too far. Now they are using vaccine “misinformation” to gain the brand new ability to choose what is and isn’t said online. This door might never be closed if opened, and obviously gives them the ability to use this power in regards to other topics. Isn’t this the point where we say the administration in the United States is going too far? The media, and the surgeon general of the United States, who should be ashamed of him and themselves? To come out here, after everyone who wanted the vaccine has taken it… yes there is misinformation but there always has been and it’s the job of an adult to parse information and stimuli and determine what is accurate and what is the truth. For the surgeon general to come out and, in really no uncertain terms claim that the public is too stupid to make their own decisions after reading and observing and following the news and people around them for 1.5 years, and because of that the conclusion is that the government must be granted the power to censor and choose what they think people should be allowed to even read or say, is heinous. </p>
<p>The vaccine is one size fits all. Not different for different people. Superficial things like AstraZeneca can’t be used in certain ages because of clotting. We are suddenly acting like it’s normal that every citizen on earth might be mandated to take the exact same brand new medication, discounting the massive spectrum of different effects any and all foods and regular medications have across a variety of the billions of different variations of human being currently existing. </p>
<p>I believe we are living through a hysteria. The signs of it are there when I look back. In my hometown, a village of 800 people, the benches and garbage cans in town were roped off with police tape at the start of this. Everyone had hearts on their windows and messages saying “we are all in this together” and so on, as if it was the end of the world. Nobody even in my small village was walking around outside, maybe a couple people. It was incredibly eerie. Nobody wanted to touch anything or a gas pump, everyone had to use tap debit now, the drive-thrus tried all sorts of strange and stupid experiments to avoid hand to hand contact, the drive-thrus gave out masks… there was a person I saw who ordered a coffee in the Tom Hortons drive thru and literally sanitized the whole cup at the window before driving away. There were LINE UPS outside of every single grocery store like we were in the Soviet Union all of a sudden. I’ll never forget it, I took pictures the first time I saw it. </p>
<p>Personal anecdote: I had a therapist a while back. One day I went in for a session, I guess this would’ve been maybe around end of December 2020, or January 2020. I told her I had been seeing things about this new coronavirus in China starting to spread. At this point I was starting to bring it up to people in my life. She sort of berated me, like laughed/brushed it off, and said something along the lines of “ohhh liljes that’s nothing to worry about! You’re not losing sleep over that are you?” Then she gave me a personal anecdote about the swine flu, and how at the time the management (her office was on the ground floor of a hospital) had told her and the other staff to come in through the back door instead of the front main hospital entrance, and how she thought it was so silly at the time. Fast forward a few months later and she is calling me on the phone, saying that we can only do our sessions on the phone now because of coronavirus. That’s an example of how even the people in the “medical world” or “professional” are people too, and that they get things wrong as well.</p></p>

        <p>I mean, the goal is to impose mandatory vaccination. Which is far more profitable than a population that can choose what the hell they put into their bodies.</p>
<p>Also, lets say that you kill a bunch in the process and injure another bunch, the second bunch will go back to your products in hopes that they can recover from the injuries you caused. On top of that, you can't be held accountable in any way. So a bunch of dead people means nothing because you are protected.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, don't think for a second that we will be of any value to the psychopathic 1% once they are able to launch the 4th industrial revolution, which is essentially fully automated work with some monitoring maybe.</p>
<p>Then my bet is that people will start dying because "people are depressed without working".</p>

        <p>Well it’s not bad at the moment I guess. Jason Kenny did say that he’s not going to implement a vaccine passport or mandatory vaccines and won’t support it federally, but I do wonder if the federal government has the power to mandate it which is a concern.</p>
<p>The other thing too is private business implementing their own passes which does kind of suck if it happens, which I believe it could because they whole world seems desperate for it to happen. Honestly I’m not too worried though because I know if they did that, most business wouldn’t be able to survive with the massive amounts of customers lost, but I guess that’s why governments want to mandate this, a small part anyways. Crazy world.</p>
<p>I have family in ontario. What’s going on there lately around you?</p>

        <p>I think Alberta is probably more free than the rest of us. Well, Ontario is hell. We just got back the right to get haircuts a few weeks ago, and last Friday, gyms opened again. We are in Step 3. There is no Step 4. Which means come winter they will lock us down again and I will officially lose it. We have almost 80% vaxxed here. I am 99% sure vaxx passports will emerge before long. Maybe October? Once people get sick again, the hysteria will increase and voila. 😔</p>

        <p>Wow, yeah I definitely agree. I think the closures will happen again and I can see the narrative forming that it’s the unvaccinated’s fault that the vaccine isn’t working at that so called 95% efficacy that they’ve been banging on about, and effective against the delta variant, for what feels like ages now. Sounds like a perfect recipe to force everyone else to take it. So I am concerned about that.</p>
<p>Oh I did get my first little fold out flyer booklet in the mail telling me to get vaccinated and that it’s safe, which I felt was quite dystopian. Not like I already had enough dystopia with the constant radio ads, ads before every couple YouTube videos, commercial campaigns, etc.</p>

        <p>Personally I think the best thing is to be honest to anyone and everyone what you really think about all of this. How terrible this is, what’s happening, the manipulation and the freedom stealing. </p>
<p>I think when people see that certain people of a certain personality that they might not expect are totally not putting up with this crap and lining up to get shots and ready for a booster and so on, and that they are still fine and living life, it has an impact, to see someone in your life having this total opposite opinion of you, you might think, how did they come to that conclusion, after I’ve respected them for so many years? They may hate you for it or maybe even want you dead, but hey, this is a revelatory moment we are all living in.</p>
