    <strong>Smallpox vaccine vs Covid vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Back in 2002, CBS News called the smallpox vaccine the most dangerous vaccine in the world. "No one is certain how many people will be hurt by the vaccine. A 1969 study found that, out of every one million people vaccinated, 74 will suffer serious complications, and at least one will die."  My math skills calculate that one person in a million is 0.0001 percent. </p>
<p>Contrast the smallpox vaccine to the Covid-19 vaccine where MSN "fact-checkers" state: "As of publication (May 2, 2021), at least 37 million coronavirus vaccinations have been administered in these countries, according to Bloomberg's global vaccine tracker. In those countries, the total number of reported deaths that have occurred post-vaccination is fewer than 250. As US data includes user-submitted information, at least 181 of these cases have not been independently verified."   My math skills calculate that 250 deaths from 37 million doses is 0.0007 percent.   If the Covid vaccine was as safe as the smallpox vaccine there would be 37 deaths.</p>
<p>Smallpox vaccine, death rate 0.0001 &lt; most dangerous vaccine ever</p>
<p>Covid-19 vaccine, death rate 0.0007 &lt; <strong>safe and effective</strong> (CDC) </p>
