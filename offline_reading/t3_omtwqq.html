        <p>Yes, and after that war we imported all their best Natzis created an intelligence agency and here we are now.  But true, I don’t fear this stupid pandemic</p>

        <p>Some scientists are no longer certain FDR had “polio.” They suggest GBS.</p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/10/31/roosevelt.polio.reut/</p>
<p>https://gizmodo.com/franklin-delano-roosevelt-probably-didnt-have-polio-aft-5958933</p>
<p>DDT was part of the “polio” scam.</p>
<p>“Polio” is a <a href="http://whale.to/a/bealle2.html#December%2016,%201955%20VACCINE%20FRONT">classic scam</a> of grouping DDT/other paralysis-inducing poisoning, GBS and other forms of paralysis under one banner to sell the panic. Then once you starting doling out “polio” shots you reclassify things as needed to uphold the Pharma “polio” vaccine racket.</p>
<p><strong>“Dr. Biskind had the composure to argue what he thought was the most obvious explanation for the polio epidemic:</strong> Central nervous system diseases (CNS) such as polio are actually the physiological and symptomatic manifestations of the ongoing government- and industry-sponsored inundation of the world’s populace with <strong>central nervous system poisons</strong>.” ^1</p>
<p>“Early in 1949, as a result of studies during the previous year, the author published reports implicating <strong>DDT</strong> preparations in the syndrome widely attributed to a ‘virus-X’ in man, in ‘X-disease’ in cattle and in often fatal syndromes in dogs and cats. The relationship was promptly denied by government officials, who provided no evidence to contest the author’s observations but relied solely on the prestige of government authority and sheer numbers of experts to bolster their position. . . .” </p>
<p><strong>“Investigator Jim West unearthed Biskind’s writings and testimony</strong>, along with other reports about the effects of poisons on the CNS, dating from the mid-nineteenth century. West compiled the following graphs, noting the correlation of pesticide use and polio incidence in the United States.41 <strong>As use of DDT in the United States declined, so did the incidence of polio. Vaccination programs were introduced at the same time and take credit for the decline.</strong> ^2</p>
<p><strong>West says: A clear, direct, one-to-one relationship between pesticides and polio over a period of thirty years, with pesticides preceding polio incidence in the context of the [central nervous system]- related physiology . . . leaves little room for complicated virus arguments, even as a cofactor.”</strong></p>
<p>“The polio death rate was decreasing on its own before the vaccine was introduced, and there is no credible scientific evidence that the vaccine caused polio to disappear. Cases of polio increased after mass inoculations.” ^3</p>
<p><strong>”In Biskind’s opinion, the spread of polio after the Second World War was caused “by the most intensive campaign of mass poisoning in known human history.”</strong> ^141 Along with DDT, the much more poisonous DDE was also used in the USA. <strong>Both toxins are known to break through the hematoencephalic barrier, which protects the brain from poisons or harmful substances.</strong> Nonetheless, housewives were urged to spray both DDT and DDE to prevent the appearance of polio. <strong>Even the wallpaper in children’s rooms was soaked in DDT before it was glued on the wall.</strong> ^4</p>
<p>A look at statistics shows that <strong>the polio epidemic in the USA reached its peak in 1952, and from then on rapidly declined. We have seen that this cannot be explained by the Salk-inoculation, since this was first introduced in 1955.</strong> There is a most striking parallel between polio development and the utilization of the severe neurotoxin DDT and other highly toxic pesticides like BHC (lindane), which was also hard to degrade and actually much more poisonous than DDT. While use of DDT was eventually drastically reduced because of its extreme harmfulness, the use of BHC was curbed because it produced a bad taste in foods.</p>
<p><strong>“It is worth noting that DDT production rose dramatically in the United States after 1954,”</strong> Jim West remarks, “which is primarily connected to the fact that <strong>DDT was increasingly exported to the Third World,</strong> to be used primarily in programs to fight malaria or in agriculture.”</p>
<p><strong>"The vaccination programs are irrelevant to the decline of polio, while pesticides correlate perfectly with polio.</strong> The unfunded, ostracized theory of poison causality far exceeds all other theories in simplicity, exactitude, and directness regarding correlations within all data areas: dosage, physiology, etiology, epidemiology, economics, and politics."</p>
<p>-Jim West </p>
<p><strong>”As of today, no programs have been funded to investigate or validate the scientific findings that implicate associations between chemicals like DDT and arsenic and the syndrome of poliomyelitis. Instead, the world is reliant upon blemished vintage research that was funded by the major medico-political powers of the first half of the 20th century.</strong> ^5</p>
<p>The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis was <strong>overseen by the major medical monopoly, the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Vaccination continues as the sole intervention for the perceived problem of poliomyelitis in India and other undeveloped countries, even in the face of <strong>vaccine-induced paralysis, vaccine virus mutations, and obvious failures. When vaccine programs don’t live up to their promises, the blame is always placed on the unvaccinated,</strong> or a new angle is drawn to the tune of “five vaccines per child may not be enough.” <strong>By sleight of hand—changing the diagnosis of old-time polio to AFP—any ongoing paralysis will be covered while the dimes continue to roll in.”</strong></p>
<p>“History books of the future may reflect upon a disaster with this conclusion: <strong>Wild poliovirus should have been left alone and the real sources of paralysis pursued and addressed.”</strong></p>

        <p>FDR, Churchill, and Stalin all worked together with the Zionists to quite literally force Germany into WW2. Before you go calling me a Nazi bigot ask questions or do your own research on these claims as they are true, no matter how difficult it is to accept.</p>
