        <p>Have you read up on leaky vaccine syndrome?</p>
<p>You know previous attempts at coronavirus vaccines created ADE?</p>
<p>You know the mRNA tech has been studied a long time but not used before, due to both technical challenges and safety issues?</p>
<p>You know to overcome the technical side, they use nanolipid particles, more usually used for getting drugs past the blood-brain barrier?</p>
<p>You know the mRNA shows up all over the body, proving the nanoparticles are NOT saying in the shoulder pad or lymph node?</p>
<p>You know most people survive corona with no problem, and that percentage goes even higher with Ivermectin, a safe and reliable drug?</p>
<p>You know there are huge conflicts of interest across all the big players, from Google to Reuters, Big Pharma, even the CDC, the WHO etc etc? They are ALL heavily invested in or funded by vaccine makers and the Gates foundation or its spin-offs.</p>
<p>You know you just got permanently banned from a bunch of subs, for daring to post on here?</p>

        <p>One of the primary purposes of government is to protect life. There are immunocompromised individuals who may not be able to get vaccines, or if they do get them they are much less effective for them. Even if you feel you don’t benefit much from the vaccine, the reality is your failure to get vaccines could cause immunocompromised people to die.</p>

        <p>The primary purpose of government is to provide basic services, no protect life.  This is a perversion of the system which has been used to exert massive over reach.  Protrcting life should be primarily the responsibility of an individual. </p>
<p>The government isn't forcing people to stop being obese which is the primary risk factor for severe covid.   If people will not take basic steps to improve their own health I won't take an experimental vaccine to "protect" them.</p>

        <p>The government should not regulate health in this way. I’m a big believer in individual responsibility. But the difference is the immunocompromised did not make the choice to be immunocompromised. The obese person made individual choices to have that health outcome. Much different.</p>
<p>I would compare not getting vaccinated to driving drunk. The government should be able to regulate both. Both actions have the potential to kill people who weren’t involved in performing those actions.</p>

        <p>The complete denial of natural acquired immunity and prior immunity indicates protecting immunocompromised is not the objective of the vaccines.  </p>
<p>A healthy person that does not have covid cannot transmit covid to others and does not require an experimental injection to retain their basic human rights.</p>

<p>Pharma stands to make $100 Billion dollars over the next couple years through the Vax the world and take your boosters program.   That is enough money to lie and manipulate study results.</p>

        <p>Please tell us all about your knowledge and experience with immunocompromised people. How do people become immunocompromised? How do people become un-immunocompromised? Why should healthy people be forced to take experimental pharmaceutical products that are currently causing people to become immunocompromised? What experience do you have with these immunocompromised people that lead you to take such a strong stance to mandate the population become lab rats for pharma?</p>

        <p>I haven’t had a vaccine since I was a infant. I have spent my entire working life working directly with children and people. I’ve worked with disabled children and adults, as a nanny, caretaker and later a stylist. I’ve been sneezed on, spit on, I’ve had feces on me. Ive had my face directly in front of plenty of people and inhaled their breath. </p>
<p>I DON’T GET SICK. I exercise and eat pristinely. I don’t eat processed junk foods. Most importantly I don’t take pharmaceutical products. My health is my responsibility.  </p>
<p>Why do you think I should be forced to take experimental pharmaceutical products from criminal companies?
Why do you hold such a selfish belief? Are you getting paid by pharma for this endeavor? If not, Why are you working for criminal companies for free? 
How have you spent your life trying to make this world better?</p>

        <p>I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I just dont want to take this one until it's been out for a while.  And I totally reject any kind of "VaxxPass" system, because that will lead to social credit. And that is (to me) obviously a part of this whole thing.</p>

        <p>Most, if not all, of those links have nothing to do with human-to-human transmission of disease. What’s a payment from Pfizer got to do with anything?</p>
<p>I do prefer studies, but in this case I think most people can anecdotally say that disease can spread from human-to-human. How come when I take care of a family member who is sick with a cold that I often catch a cold a couple of days later? That stuff happens all the time. If you truly believe disease can’t pass from human-to-human, would you want to hangout by a person with Ebola?</p>

        <p>So a study is false if the individuals behind the study have money or have a vested interest? It could be the case that there’s a bias in the study, but you actually have to look at the methods and determine whether they were sound or not.</p>

        <p>Pharma is one of the most corrupt industries on earth. I’ve already cited ample evidence to prove this fact. They are going to support anything that is going to give them more money and control. Hence, research is mostly fraudulent.
Whole system is rigged.</p>
<p>Medical education and research were taken over by the corrupt Rockefeller Syndicate over 100 years ago. They teamed with the crooks in the AMA to build a protection racket for their corrupt Pharma cartel, which later allied with the criminal German Dye Trust.</p>
<p>Long before vaccines and antibiotics, “infectious” diseases had mostly faded away due to sanitation, hygiene and nutrition improvements. This would’ve been bad for the business interests of the AMA and Pharma.
So they mostly swapped autoimmune diseases and cancers for the old “infectious” diseases, creating many evergreen “treatment” franchises. </p>
<p>&rt;“While science greatly extended the original nontechnological advances in agriculture, hygiene, and birth control, the contribution of medical science to the overall reduction in death rates and improved health was relatively quite small. ^1:220-221</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In the great majority of cases the toll of the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"The <strong>chief credit</strong> for the conquest of the destructive epidemics ... ought to have been given <strong>to the social reformers</strong> who had campaigned for purer water, better sewage disposal and improved living standards. <strong>It had been their efforts, rather than the achievement of the medical scientists, which had been chiefly responsible for the reduction in mortality from infectious disease"</strong>. ^2:12

<p>&rt;<strong>“MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE ROCKEFELLERS</strong></p>
<p>&rt;The merchants-in-medicine, organized in the A.M.A., found allies in their fellow merchants in industry at the beginning of this century. <strong>It is peculiarly fitting that the agency that enabled them to monopolize the field of medicine and its education should be the General Education Board, an outgrowth of Doc William Rockefeller’s quack cancer cure and medicine show.”</strong> (5:93)</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE</strong></p>
<p>&rt;...The establishment of the Rockefeller Institute marked the <strong>firm saddling of big business and its methods on medical research.</strong> From the start an alliance was formed with the American Medical Association.”(5:107)</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Up to 90% of the total decline in the death rate of children between 1860-1965</strong> because of whooping cough, scarlet fever, diptheria, and measles <strong>occurred before the introduction of immunisations and antibiotics."</strong> ^6
&rt;<em>-Dr. Archie Kalokerinos, M.D.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Much of what you have been led to believe about immunizations simply isn't true.”</strong> ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”If immunizations were responsible for the diminishing or disappearance of these diseases in the United States, <strong>one must ask why they disappeared simultaneously in Europe, where mass immunizations did not take place.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”With the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”For thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.”</p>
<p>&rt;”In 1900 there were 13.3 measles deaths per 100,000 population. <strong>By 1955, before the first measles shot, the death rate had declined 97.7 percent to only 0.03 deaths per 100,000.”</strong> ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”Similarly, for England and Wales <strong>John Powles shows that overall mortality declined</strong> over the last hundred years <strong>well in advance of specific immunizations and therapies.</strong> ^1:220</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/obituaries/rene-dubos-scientist-and-writer-dead.html">Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</a> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“Many so-called "medical discoveries",</strong> however, have been <strong>announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^8</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported</strong> on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that <strong>microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination.</strong> One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J.,</strong> who stressed that <strong>‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases</strong> including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease <strong>and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^9</p>
<p>&rt;##“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals</strong> pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the <strong>present measures used</strong> to check contagious diseases <strong>may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments</strong> used to check diseases, <strong>he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate</strong> that America may become a nation of invalids. <strong>Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young."</strong> (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^10</p>
<p>&rt;”Medical records prove that a <strong>90% decline</strong> in child mortality from scarlet fever, diptheria, whooping cough and measles occurred <strong>before the introduction of antibiotics and immunization,</strong> from 1860-1896. ^11</p>
<p>&rt;”I read what prominent men of science, medical officers for health, and doctors wrote about vaccination and its sequelae that never made it into today’s textbooks, and found out what anyone with even a passing acquaintance with disease figures of the 19th and 20th century knew. For example, by the 1950s when the whooping cough vaccine was introduced, data showed that whooping cough was killing only 1 percent of the numbers of people who used to die in England and Wales 50 years before. ^12</p>
<p>&rt;Official data showed that the same happened with measles.”</p>

        <p>They were inoculated with "viral" culture not from the original host. In the discussion they admit that hamsters eat their shit which wouldn't rule out excreted toxins that were initially dosed into the index hamster. They also didn't describe the pathological changes in the contact hamsters except to say they were "similar". The only change they actually documented was weight loss which showed a significant difference in the contact hamsters, which would support a lower dose of toxin from the index hamsters shit.</p>

        <p>That was not the only change. The important change is that the contact hamsters tested positive with a PCR test, meaning that the RNA sequence they looked for was present. And they sequenced the spike protein gene, meaning that that genetic information was also present.</p>

        <p>No .. we are going to stop and frisk <em>anybody</em> the police want to.</p>
<p>They should be able to act on hunches.  If they think you look "up to no good" they should be able to stop and search you.</p>
<p>That's the most effective way to reduce crime.  </p>

        <p>Yeah I don’t think the way to do mandatory vaccinations are from any de jure requirement. It’s probably through a requirement to get them to attend school and such, which at that point makes it a de facto requirement. That’s what I had in my state growing up with measles, TB, etc.</p>

        <p>&rt; If the law enforcement officer genuinely had a suspicion you are up to no good, then yes I think it’s appropriate to stop and question them. </p>
<p>No .. full search.  If you are not hiding anything you have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>&rt;There’s only so far they can go without probable cause of course due to the 5th amendment.</p>
<p>We are going to change that, to make things more safe.</p>
<p>Your personal rights are not as important as the safety of the community. </p>
<p>How do I know that you arent an armed killer?</p>
<p>I need to feel safer.  So I need you to comply with full searches by police for any reason.</p>

        <p>Public policy is a balancing act of weighing pros and cons. Being subject to a full search 100% of the time is significantly more intrusive than getting a vaccination imo. The nurse puts it in your up, squeezes for a second, and then you’re done with it. I don’t see what the big deal is honestly.</p>

<p>So literally nothing else happens after that? The vaccine doesn't alter the behavior of unknown numbers and types of your cells?</p>

        <p>Your body has an immune response to know how to fight off the virus (there’s nuance to this depending on type of vaccine). But yeah, that’s the gist of it.</p>
