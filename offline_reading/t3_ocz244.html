    <strong>Anyone else think that the constant bribing about the COVID vaccines actually hurt their effort overall?</strong>
    <p><p>Ironically this seemed counterintuitive to their vaccine initiative, because when I heard that they were starting to be distributed starting 2020 December, I was 50/50 on it, my stance was to wait and see the long-term effects before even getting it since it was still way too early, but I wasn't 100% opposed to it yet, but after the events of the last 5 months with the constant bragging + lotteries + free scholarships + outright threats, I went from on the fence to wondering what the actual fuck was going on. I saw it as well in this sub when people were discussing about the constant bribery from the officials. If their intention was to up the vaccine intake, I think this actually hurt their overall effort, basically shooting themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>Also, it doesn't help when you realize the Swine Flu vaccine 1976 FAILURE, along with the Tuskegee experiments and then also learn that the swine flu vaccine was pulled out of the market after only 10 weeks due to so many problems, and the covid vaccine already makes the swine flu vaccine look like a joke, yet the covid vaccine is STILL available.</p>
<p>For Swine flu 1976 pandemic vaccine, here's the source:</p>
<p><em>The program was suspended after at least 25 people died from vaccine reactions. Other estimates put the death toll at 32 people, while about 500 others later suffered from Guillain-Barre syndrome</em></p>
<p>So, the swine flu vaccine was absolutely nothing compared to how many problems are from the COVID vaccine, and yet... its still available for people to get. Just wow.</p>
<p>Honestly I think that President Biden would've been able to reach the 70% goal that he was planning if they didn't go so fucking hard on the propaganda, making people more skeptical. Biden's previous goals were achieved until the bribery and propaganda regarding the vaccines started to really take off. Now he has to deal with only 67% or so when July 4 comes around instead of the 70% he originally wanted (hell, who knows if that 67% number is actually even real, they've lied so many times anyway)</p>
<p>But either way, my point is that Biden's vaccine plans were easily achieved in the early months of 2021, so i don't think that its a coincidence that when they started the bribes, that most likely made his 70% by july 4 goal fail.</p></p>

        <p>Me: Why was there no seeming desperation from the governments to vaccinate the world during past pandemics?</p>
<p>Normie: Back then we didn't have the internet with all those conspiracy theories floating around. The government has to fight extra hard this time to counter-act those.</p>
<p>Me: Or maybe past vaccination campaigns had just as severe adverse effects as this one but we never learned about them because we had no internet and the MSM wouldn't report on it?</p>

        <p>Those tactics work on the segment of the population that they want to vaccinate asap - the poor and the ignorant. I hope I'm wrong and this is not a killshot but this would make sense if that was the case.</p>

        <p>I only know a handful of people who have gotten it. Out of the 5, 1 of them has absolutely not been right since taking it. Constant sinus problem and migraines and a bout of anxiety that she’s definitely never had. That’s enough for me to forego any lottery, free beer, or cheap watch they try to throw at us to get the “fauci ouchi”</p>

        <p>Yeah, all the government propaganda in the UK eventually made me look up how the vaccines are made. Read about mRNA therapy that makes your own body produces spike protein and I was instantly: "Nope, this is dangerous. I'm never having that."</p>
<p>If they'd have shut up about it I would've always thought it's a traditional vaccine with inactivated viral particles.</p>

        <p>Yeah same. Similarly with censorship. I was hesitant after my uncle had a very bad reaction but I assumed it was more an allergic reaction vs the vaccine itself. I was thinking of getting it several weeks ago seeing reopenings and lack of severe symptoms, but then seeing the coercion was an odd red flag, then the cases on VAERS kept exponentially increasing. For me the final straw was the gross censorship, and eventually reading for myself some of the early study results on mRNA vaccines (and later the podcast by Bret Weinstein which validated what I was seeing).</p>
