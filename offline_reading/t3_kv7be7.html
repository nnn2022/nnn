    <strong>Today at the post office</strong>
    <p><p>I was not wearing a mask and I wear my exemption card on my neck.</p>
<p>This little girl, 5 or 6 years old, couldn't take her eyes off me, hiding behind her mom.</p>
<p>She stared deeply and constantly at me for the whole time I was in there, doing my business. </p>
<p>When she left, she basically run and sided herself on the opposite side of the corridor, with a frightened look in her eyes. Trying to avoid me as much as possible and keep an insane distance when walking close to me. </p>
<p>I wondered why. And then I realised, its because I am not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>She is afraid l am a murderer that will kill her mom and her whole family. She was not older than 6.</p>
<p>She is afraid of a normal human being without a mask. 1/6 of her life memories are made of fear, masked people, isolation. </p>
<p>She was indoctrinated at school and by her parents and the media, to be afraid of maskless people. People that show their natural and true face. </p>
<p>That if you don't wear a mask you are an extremely dangerous individual that can put your whole family on death row. </p>
<p>It made me think about how much psychological abuse lockdowns are doing to this kids. It's hard to forget this kind of trauma when you are so young, you will probably carry it with you for your whole life. </p>
<p>We are abandoning all the kids. Teaching them to live in fear of others, that other people are nothing but pestilent murderers. </p>
<p>Save the children. </p>
<p>Can't believe I'm writing this.</p></p>

        <p>A few days ago, I was wandering around Walgreens, and a girl was picking up something in the greeting card section until her mom yelled at her to put it down, then began to drag away by the arm. "I told you not to touch anything!" the mom screamed as she walked by me (though she gave me a look of disgust because I was "too close" to her). I've seen lots of great displays of parenting like this since March 2020.</p>

        <p>Eh.</p>
<p>"Indoctrination" comes from many places. People are influenced and shaped by many things like parents, friends, celebrities, teachers, social media, etc. I'm currently arguing with someone in another post in this sub over this, even. There's people who can escape this, and become more individual, but there is often a price to pay for it, like ostracization from others. Soon, the idea is that the technocrats will make our online activities and identities tied to our offline lives as well, that seems to be a part of the current agenda.</p>

        <p>I'm glad someone does. The other argument on this topic is just downvotes and huffiness. Though I stand by my opinion on this. It's kind of naive to believe otherwise. </p>
<p>If things like school and social media had no influence, then the elites wouldn't bother using those tools. Sure, some can quit or not participate, but it won't matter because the masses love to indulge in drama. This is really no different to gossiping and rock flinging back in the 1800s and before then. Humans seem to thrive on this.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the next generation is doomed.  Left-wingers have chosen the side of the new overlords.  They are doomed and their children are doomed.  They will be the ones who gladly side with the police and military if this escalates to civil war.  They were the ones cheering the riots last year.  Hell, many of them were in the riots last year.   My roommate's family and my family were denying the existence of the riots.  They were peaceful protests and nothing more.  They completely denied the fires, the murders, the rapes, and attacks against police.   When a reporter was attacked by rioters, they posted his face with his bloody eye and stated that he was attacked by Trump supporters who were attacking the peaceful protesters.</p>
<p>This is why my roommate and I have cut family out of our lives.  We can't live with brainwashed people in our social circle.   We can't live in fear of a virus that doesn't exist.</p>
<p>When I came in to work today, I had my temperature taken like always was asked that same question I've heard hundreds of times, "Any new symptoms?"  I replied, "No."  She responded, "Well, you answered that a little too quickly."  I turned and glared at her and she quickly said, "You're all set." and let me through.</p>
<p>I just can't take this shit anymore.  If you want to take my temp, fine.  If you want to ask that stupid question, fine.  But I won't tolerate someone questioning me over a virus that ended a long time ago and is no threat to the population.  People need to keep their fear to themselves.  I'm having greater and greater difficulty keeping my anger in check every time I have to deal with these fucking doomers.</p>
<p>Honestly, without a civil war, I don't see any hope for the children of the future.</p>

        <p>My cousin is doing this to her kids - my aunt said the 7 year old broke down weeping one day because she was visiting my aunt and had forgotten her mask (which she wouldn't wear anyway at my aunt's house), and she was just saying she was so scared to go outside.</p>
<p>I do not wear a mask and I certainly don't try to force my toddlers to. I am trying to teach them what normal life is like and to make them as emotionally healthy as possible.</p>

        <p>This hits so much harder because a huge chunk of my family has said they no longer want anything to do with me because my risk of transmission to them is too high for them to take that chance. They said even after everything is cleared, they'll no longer feel comfortable being in the same room as me because we don't live together. I've also endured people saying they hope I die cause I didn't wear gloves or because my mask fell off for half a second.</p>

        <p>I really try not to take sides on this issue because we were all perfectly fine not wearing them 2 years ago but I do think they generally help.</p>
<p>However I will say just because you are medically exempted from needing to wear one doesn't mean that you're not contagious or can't spread diseases so if a company asks you to wait outside or do curb pick up please don't hassle them, they're looking out for other customers as well as themselves.</p>
<p>Like if you're allergic to latex condoms and a doctor gives you a note that says you don't have to wear them that doesn't mean you can't spread STDs.</p>

        <p>Human biology, mainly.
Not sure where op lives but most “mandates” “respect” exemptions for people with health conditions like asthma. An exemption card around the neck sounds authoritarian as hell to me and is no different from wearing a Jude star</p>

        <p>Human biology...broad strokes. Was curious specifically, your example...for example is not an actual exemption for wearing a mask unless say you were actively having an asthma attack. Obviously in an acute medical emergency taking the mask of an asthmatic might be worthwhile.</p>
