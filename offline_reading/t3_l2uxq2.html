        <p>I thought so. I just wasn’t sure if someone here posted it from a pro-covid page for a laugh at how sad they are or if they were being childish enough to think it’s funny posting it here to get a rise out of us. The amount of effort they go through to take time out of their lives to make an account just to post such a childish photo is actually pretty sad</p>

        <p>The main issue is that they want to paint anyone asking questions as a "Covid Denier". People are bored/polarized/have been coerced into being useful idiots. Why make bots when misinformed people will do the chattering for you.</p>

        <p>lol Pseudo/anti-science your just making shit up What do you wanna argue about masks lockdowns I got points and opinions on all of them just say the topci.</p>
<p>Using the word conspiracy shows your bias people should have the freedom to share opinions or theories without them being labeled. SO you know things like the meeting between banking  elites both North American and European at Jekyll island to form the federal reserve was treated s conspiracy for many many years</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Go read the book titled The creature from Jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve. Every single fact should be presented and you should be able to make objective decisions upon labeling things as conspiracy just makes a real discussion harder to have.</p>
<p>subs like /r/coronrovirus are just as much of a echo chamber they also ban and censor more</p>
<p>I don't think everyone is a sheep I think people say that here because what we are fed on Reddit primarily is extremely cultivated with bais towards this stuff in real life it's not like that</p>
<p>this summer I went to the skatepark a lot and nobody wore masks nobody distanced all thee kids were bitching about what their teachers were forcing them to do and pointing out the hypocrisy in the enforcement etc like 14-16 age group</p>
<p>The young people you see on social media do not reflect, what younger kids and other people think like in real life.</p>
<p>one question did you make this or did you just find it on the internet because their are like 4 or 5 memes that people repost here and i feel like this might get to being one of them even though it is not even good</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>guy already deleted his acc so w/e have a nice day man</p>
