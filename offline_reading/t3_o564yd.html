    <strong>Why were the principles of "do no harm" ignored in all of this?</strong>
    <p><p>"Do no harm" is a guiding principle that ""first do no harm" is that, in certain cases, it may be better to do nothing rather than intervening and potentially causing more harm than good."</p>
<p>Sometimes desperation requires extreme measures and doctors pursue treatments that would otherwise be seen as reckless but it's agreed upon that the potential harms are justified in that the patient is likely to be dead soon either way.</p>
<p>For example, the vaccines  were not tested to the same standards giving the Emergency Use Authorization because the rationale was that the risk of getting covid is more dangerous than the known and possibly unknown side effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Do no harm" seems to make a lot more sense when it is applied to an individual patient but the calculation is much different when you are treating an entire population in the context of an epidemic.  What are the guiding principles for treating the population as a whole since perceived harm is relative to the individual?  In other words how do they decide what is for the greater good and where is this discussion and consensus being formed?</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> </p>
<p>In the tradition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">Trolley Problem</a>, what is the threshold for acceptable harm do we accept to save the lives or limit the suffering for some much smaller percentage of the population.</p></p>

        <p>It's nuts.  I'm 100% in favor of "right to try" laws or of having new treatments generally available to patients before full testing is done.</p>
<p>But this is becoming mandatory in many places around earth.</p>
<p>The fact that this is a bioweapon has terrorized 70% if society.</p>

        <p>It may have been a gamble worth taking if:</p>
<p>The disease was anywhere near a deadly as they try to portray</p>
<p>The vaccines actually stopped you from getting it or transmitting it, which seems to be something that has evaded the vast majority of those who want to ostracise those who do not want to be guinea pigs in the worlds largest lab</p>
