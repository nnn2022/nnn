    <strong>[Rant] I don't want grandma to die, but I don't want to die either.</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: I am at the end of my rope, and I really don't know what to do, or where to turn. </p>
<p>Probably not the place to talk about this but my mental health is in the shitter. </p>
<p>I gave up on college even though I used to be an A student. I haven't been on a date in months. I have 2 friends and I see them maybe once a week, but all we do is game watch movies and drink. I got fired from a job in construction, and almost every business is not hiring. So I just sit at home and stew. </p>
<p>I feel like my brain is eating itself. I have come close to suicide multiple times in the last 3 months, and I don't know how much more of this I can take. </p>
<p>I am so worried that this is it. That I'm never going to get my life back. The degree, the friendships, relationships, my <em>fucking future</em>. All gone because people are so afraid of dying that everything has to stop. And to top it all off, I can't talk about this with anyone or I'm selfish. I care about grandma and my neighbors and healthcare workers. I don't want them to suffer. But you know what, <strong>what about me?</strong> No one cares about the sacrifices that millions of people are being forced to make. It's just about keeping the numbers down. I don't even think this is about control, or a power grab. I think that my parents and my generations (Gen x - Gen Z) have become so accustomed to the easy life that the very idea of loss has become so repulsive that they are willing to sacrifice anything and everything to simply feel a bit more secure. </p>
<p>Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but I'm overwhelmed and this feels like one of the last places that I can open up about how I feel, without getting mocked or shamed. Thanks for reading. I feel a little bit better now :)</p></p>

        <p>Real talk... If you were actually willing to die and end it all... Why not at least fight back against this crap by not complying first?</p>
<p>This could be your calling. You could be the one that refuses to obey these dickheads that took your plans away. </p>
<p>You will make new friends. Perhaps some enemies. </p>
<p>If they’re gonna take you out, make sure they’ve earned it. I think you’ll find that you have more power in standing up for your liberty and life than crawling in a hole waiting for hope that constantly evades you. </p>
<p>Get out there and fucking show em who they underestimated. You will no longer be their fucking monkey. You will not obey these clowns. </p>
<p>You have nothing to lose except your self respect at this point. Show em who you are. Because I know for FUCKING SURE you have what it takes to make a difference. </p>
<p>Head held high, beautiful face open and free. They don’t own you. Remind them of this.</p>

        <p>Please hold on, I feel the same. You are important, I am important. People like us are so important now. We can't lose you in it here. Not one of the true people. We just don't see the results yet...because: </p>
<p>we don't do it for our ego like the people that claim they are heroes by wearing a mask/pro lockdown but for the greater good, so please hold on. It's been tough for me aswell &amp; feeling hopeless but  we can't let them have  what they want. Not that easy. I care for you  and it breaks my heart that many people feel the same like we do and noone seems to care and we're left feeling alone. But that's true strength I believe. We do it because we are convinced it's the right thing, not for likes, not for acceptance. Please hold on and be with me in that case. We're all counting on each other.</p>

        <p>Please do not end your life and give them what they want. There are more likeminded people out here than you or I even realize. All hope may be lost right now, but all hope is not lost forever. I feel this, and I understand.</p>
