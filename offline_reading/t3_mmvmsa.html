&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“In terms of increasing trust, I think it’s a very different mosaic in the US from maybe even 10 years ago, I think we have a very politically charged environment, and frankly, that gets in the way of actually the practicality of instituting an identity system.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I hope that gets mitigated, but I think the current environment in the US — everything ID-related is getting politicized; fairly or unfairly, depending on which side of the fence you sit.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“If you have entrenched systems, it’s incredibly difficult to leapfrog, so you’re almost better off being in a country that doesn’t have a structured, entrenched system. I think the US is going to be very hard-pressed to get a national identity system in the way that Ukraine has done, or Estonia, or some of the other countries that are out there like India as well. I think we’re going to have our own brand of fragmented identity mixed with public-private partnerships. I think that’s the only way the innovation’s really going to happen,”</p>

<p>&rt;“The Ukrainian Parliament has also adopted a draft law making us one of the first countries to legalize digital passports, which means we have fully put an ‘equal sign’ between plastic or paper passports and IDs and digital IDs, and now they’re accessible in all life situations.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“The pandemic has accelerated our progress. First of all, people are really now demanding digital, online services. <strong><em>People have no choice but to trust technology</em></strong>. We see what kind of business is developing, and this business is influencing the development of our services.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“We believe that we have to make the best product possible, a high quality product, a product that is so convenient that a person will be able to disrupt their stereotypes, to breakthrough from their fears, and start using a government-made application. When we allow a person to register a business in three clicks; when we allow them to pay their taxes in two clicks — no matter how skeptical a person is about the technology, they will start using our services.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>“Our goal is to enable all life situations with this digital ID."</em></strong><br>
