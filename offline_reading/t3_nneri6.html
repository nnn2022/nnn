        <p>Oh, interesting. I had never heard of this guy.</p>
<p>The PCR test was actually invented by Kary Mullis: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis</a></p>
<p>&rt;Kary Banks Mullis (December 28, 1944 – August 7, 2019) was an American biochemist. In recognition of his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, he shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Michael Smith[4] and was awarded the Japan Prize in the same year. His invention became a central technique in biochemistry and molecular biology, described by The New York Times as "highly original and significant, virtually dividing biology into the two epochs of before PCR and after PCR."[5]</p>
<p>Kary Mullis was Dr. Fauci's #1 critic and you can find fascinating interviews of him scolding Fauci for misusing his test (in regard to HIV diagnosis) and demanding to face him in a debate... But Fauci would never debate him and there was a media blackout about the controversy.</p>
<p>Interesting timeline:</p>
<p><strong>2017 Jan 10</strong> = Fauci says, "<strong>There will be a surprise outbreak</strong> and I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you'll understand why"</p>

<p><strong>Jun 28, 2017</strong> = <strong>World Bank Launches First-Ever Pandemic Bonds</strong> to Support $500 Million Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility. It was 200% oversubscribed and they lured investors in with promise of an 11% guaranteed return (hint: investors lost their money. I'm GUESSING this is how they raised money to pay off officials globally, and many of the biggest investors probably knew they would lose... But gain it back during the pandemic.)</p>

        <p>What this guy did was make up a fraudulent covid test from Mullis’s pcr procedure. Isn’t it interesting how all this went down a few months after Mullis died? Imagine what he’d be saying about the test if he was still alive.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is one of many <em>very strange</em> coincidences in regard to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Everything these people do is in plain sight, if we can figure out where to look. I'm sure you saw Parker Crutchfield's lobbying for covert medical  bioenhancent? And Kissinger's Security Memorandum 200 that makes reference to sterility vaccines?</p>

        <p>Honestly the root of covid scam is the test itself. There is no covid if you don’t have a test for it. The paper itself is laughable. They basically guess the people sick in Wuhan have similar symptoms to SARS based on “social media reports”. So they base off the test from (also not proven to exist) SARS genetic sequen ce and guess the additional sequence, yes, guessing. So all the papers and news now claiming covid exist are based from this bogus test.</p>
<p>If you are a scientist, and have this supposedly dangerous pandemic, don’t you want to gather a group of sick people from Wuhan, get their swabs from them, identify which common pathogen that might cause it, study it, prove whether it can spread and cause disease?</p>
<p>Nah they won’t. They just guess from “social media reports” and add bunch of “random” genetic sequence, call it a day, and justify it to lockdown the world.</p>

        <p>You dont think Pcr testing actually works for this use case do you? Its creator avidly disagrees with it being used to test for Infection of Coronaviruses. Kerry Mullis actively disapproved of it being used that way as it isnt applicable. More would know that It is bullshit If he was alive today. He would never have let this go on without all of the world knowing about it. He died just before this all started of pneumonia some say he was assassinated neither proven.</p>

        <p>PCR test for the presence of the virus not whether its alive or if it is enough to cause concern. You could already be immune and your test would come back positive because of the dead virus particles still in your body. Thats why its not good For what its being used for as "you can find anything in anything." those are words of  Kerry mullis its inventor himself.  It is the perfect tool to bullshit case numbers.</p>
