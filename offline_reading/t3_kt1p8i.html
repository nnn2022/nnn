    <strong>I'm done being nice about this. I've been hiding this for months and I need to let it out</strong>
    <p><p>I'm fucking done caring about this. Doomers give all their care to some 85 year old but fuck young people, amirite? Hell even older people want to go outside and live out their final years, but they have to live in loneliness and watch their grandchildren suffer during their final years. Doomers don't truly care about lives or older people. They just want validation, but we're the fucking selfish ones. The ones that want to hang out with family and friends. Hiding people's faces with face muzzles, locking people up in their homes until they go insane, depriving people of social interaction all for a fucking virus with a 99.997% survival rate. Fucking ridiculous. Look at the places like New York City where mask compliance is high, THEY'RE CASES ARE SKYROCKETING meanwhile Florida doesn't have any lockdowns or mask mandates THEY'RE NUMBERS ARE STILL LOW. The reason places with strict rules are skyrocketing right now is because THE STRESS PUT ON PEOPLE FROM THIS SHIT. It's weakening their immune system. Losing jobs, going into poverty, getting evicted, losing businesses OH, but if Karen wore a mask in the store that wouldn't have happened!! NO, IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LOCKDOWNS! Doomers also say "The economy can recover, lives can't". WELL THE ECONOMY IS LIVES TOO THEY WERE PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AND THEY ENJOYED IT BUT IT WAS TAKEN AWAY. Doomers don't give a shit about you, they just want to virtue-signal. Doomers never gave a shit about deaths from obesity, car crashes, heart disease, or the flu but they suddenly care about a virus with a 99.997% survival rate. Since you doomers are so scared, YOU stay the fuck home, YOU wear a mask! You can even get your Ubereats in a hazmat suit, I don't fucking care just don't force your retarded ways onto us. Let us live our lives while you watch Netflix while stuffing your face in ubereats in your mom's basement like you did before the pandemic because you don't have a life.  I'm 16 and I'm fucking done with this. I have to stare at a screen for 6 hours in a laggy ass zoom class and it gives me a headache. I just want to be in a actual school. I can't hang out with friends anymore. Online isn't enough. My family has canceled plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I haven't seen my cousins or aunts in a year. I hate this so much. I just want the old normal and not this dystopian shit. It's been worse for other people. They've lost jobs, fell into depression, AND EVEN COMMITTED SUICIDE, but they don't care about those types of deaths. I fucking hate doomers with a burning passion and if I ever encountered those cunts irl, I don't think I would be able to control myself. I would punch them. If doomers don't care, why should I care?</p></p>

        <p>This. They just want to believe <em>SO BADLY</em> that their government is looking after them and caring about them and always has like they’ve believed all their lives.  <br>
They cannot be wrong, since being wrong means they were fooled a long time ago and have always been wrong. That’s a huge horse pill for them to swallow.</p>

I'm 34 years old and completely fucking livid over the fact that the twilight dusk of my youth is being <em>desecrated</em> by psychopathic tyrants, but at least my teens and twenties were comparatively happy and free. Your generation, on the other hand, has to spend the best years of your life in a living nightmare, ruled over by clowns and evil sorcerers hellbent on technocratic enslavement.

        <p>You lost me in the second sentence.  Doomer's don't give a f*** about 85 year olds.  They are rotting in nursing homes, dying of loniliness.  My conservative group has been going outside of nursing homes caroling, trying to let them know that somebody cares about them.  One of the residents stuck his hand out of the window, and held the hand of someone from our group.  He said that was the highlight of his day (or maybe week, can't remember).  None of the Doomers EVER asked what the nursing home residents want.  They NEVER asked if they want to take the risk (90% chance of survival even for 90 year olds) so they don't need to die alone.  They are just another pawn, used by the same people that warp the Doomer's brains.</p>

        <p>We are in a mass brainwashing.  Best to just cut off contact with these "friends" in hopes that maybe someday the they will gain the ability to see the world again.  Link below is one of the articles about it.  This photo in the beginning shows the resident's hand, but our caroler actually held the resident's hand and sang for quite a while.  It was a magical show of normalcy.  See the photo at the bottom, that is our group.  Really parts of several groups together.  No, it's not a photo from 2019, it's from December 2020, in New York State.  Only 1 or 2 wearing masks.  Look at the ages of people - lots of grey hair, some in 70s/80s.  Been meeting since the beginning, and none of us are dead.  We are taking a lot of heat because our existence proves the Covid narrative is a lie.  People have tried to get us fired or kicked out of our homes.  It's worked, occasionally.  It doesn't matter.  I will never accept the new normal.</p>

Miami, FL: 71 F (22 C)<br>
New York, NY: 31 F (-1 C)</p>
<p>It's almost as if getting the common cold has something to do with cold weather. Maybe that's why it's called the cold!? But hey, what do I know, I'm just a non-essential. /s</p>
<p>Oh, and yeah, I'm 100% for letting people wear or not wear exactly what they want. Full burka, butt naked. There should be no laws regarding clothing.</p>

        <p>I do agree Florida's weather no doubt has an impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>But it's spread in California like wildfire (ahem) <em>with</em> lockdowns. So basically, anywhere that lockdowns haven't worked then the assumption is that things would be worse without lockdowns, and anywhere that is fine without lockdowns well then it's because of the weather or whatever.</p>
<p>Lockdown efficacy is unfalsifiable in the views of many, and it's infuriating.</p>

<p>Anyone else losing hope? Anyone else feel that we are powerless? No, not against the doomers - those nolifers are probably dungeon dwellers so I don't think there is anything weaker than them.
But we are weak in the face of the surveillance state. Governments enforcing policing, fines and jail time. Restrictions continuing harder than ever ( UK for example ). What can we do...</p>

        <p>I couldn't agree more. The majority of 70+ people that I deal with on a daily basis, don't wear masks and don't social distance. I've asked a few of them what their feelings were towards everything "pandemic" related, and they all had the same answer: they don't care, they're not scared, and they just want to continue on with their lives. Masks don't do shit. The second that they mandated masks in my province - cases have skyrocketed, but yet they all blame it on "social gatherings". Like c'mon guys, let's maybe pull our heads out of our asses already.</p>

        <p>I live in WA where lockdowns are extremely strict. In November, I went to visit my family in FL and I still can't believe we're even in the same country. </p>
<p>Everyone was so happy there. Here, you will be shunned from society if you don't wear a mask, even if you are outside by yourself. When I take my pup to the dog park, some people will legitimately not let their dog play with mine because I'm not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I agree, I think the stress does a number on people’s immune systems, as well as the isolation and lack of fresh air. </p>
<p>Think about when you were in school, even in college. You would go back to school after being home all summer and all the germs from being around people all the time would cause you to catch a manageable cold. It was the back-to-school crud but later on you were used to it from being around people all the time! Or even the kids who lived in super clean houses who would get “allergies” the minute they were around dust. </p>
<p>These isolated doomers probably have shitty immune systems from never being exposed to people with different chemistries and germs. If you’re home all the time bathing in sanitizer, yeah you’ll get sick when you go back out, even from limited exposure. Meanwhile the folks who go out and do things are fine since they’re regularly exposed to other people. I swear it sounds like pseudoscience but it makes so much sense to me. I think me going to the gym and not wearing my mask there every day for the past 4 months has made my immune system stronger!!</p>

        <p>I am so fucking sorry, and I'm here for you. It sounds like your family have doomer leanings and that's making your situation worse, is that correct? Also, so far as the school thing goes there are some no-video online options and even mail-in options out there that might be better for you, maybe you could talk to your parents about it? Especially if your current school situation is literally causing you physical pain, hopefully that's something they will care about making better for you. </p>
<p>Regardless, I believe in you and I firmly believe that those of us who have kept our sanity intact CAN help each other through this nightmare. I hope you feel at least a little better after getting validation that you're not alone.</p>

        <p>I’m there too. I stopped giving a fuck a long time ago. I’m not wearing masks anymore. What happened on Wednesday solidified everything for me. This is all theatre. None of this is real. And people are still eating it up. The only way I feel I have any control in my own life anymore is by going against what they say. Sorry, not wearing a mask. Sorry, I’m going to leave my house and see my friends and family. They want us divided, they don’t want us talking to others and finding out the truth. Isn’t it obvious by now? They’re censoring everyone that is conservative and for Trump. They’re censoring Trump. They’re trying to stop other social media platforms from evolving. But silly me, why on earth would I think that the same people that bought the whole Covid scam wouldn’t see what’s going on now right before their very own eyes? When I was watching everything unfold on Wednesday I thought, no way is this real life rn. All of the news stations couldn’t get enough of it, they were practically creaming their pants. And you see how fast things have happened since?! It’s only Friday! Like holy shit. Scary times. My advice: Focus on what you can control. If half of the country just stopped wearing masks do you know how much would change? The one thing that stands true is they’re scared of us, and we’re easier to control when we all comply, which we are! Like if we all just said fuck no to the masks this would be done. It’s our own faults this has gone on so long, really. We can’t agree on anything and the divide that the media and TPTB were hoping for has finally happened among us. What a shame.</p>

        <p>Democrats think compassion is protecting the elderly for a virus that could kill them. Republicans think compassion is human interaction regardless of it may cause mortalities. Neither is right or wrong, it's a tradeoff between life or loneliness. </p>
<p>However, your understanding of state's responses to COVID are misinformed. New York City is an extremely dense city which is why they are so high risk. Even with mask mandates and lockdowns, they're likely to have high cases because there are so many people living close to each other and there is a higher reliance on public transport. Florida numbers are NOT low, they're climbing every day. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/</a></p>
