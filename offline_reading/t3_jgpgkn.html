    <strong>I cant go on anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I cant take this world anymore. Im so fed up with all the bullshit, fearmongering, lockdowns, and fighting i see on a daily basis. Im fully ready to die if the time comes. Only reason i havent shot myself is because im afraid of the pain like a coward. Every good thing was supposed to happen this year. All i ask is "why?" Why are we still living in this hell. Ive tried so hard to be hopeful and to be happy but i just cant do it anymore</p></p>

        <p>Hey I guess try to think of it like this. You get a lot of years on this planet to experience lots of great stuff. Don’t throw that away because of a couple of bad years, things will get better and you can make yourself happy. It’s just gonna take some patience and effort</p>

<p>Not in a post lockdown dystopia. What great stuff is there to experince in a post lockdown dystopia?</p>
<p>Low wage work?
Homelessness?
Civil unrest?
Social Alienation?</p>
<p>A lot of opportunities previous generations have are gone forever.</p>

        <p>I worry that movie mentality isn’t healthy. I often hear the phrase “it feels like something out of a movie” and I wonder how people <em>used</em> to compare it. Before movies. Would they say it feels like something out of the Bible? The Vedas? The Hellenic pantheon? Did we denigrate our perception of reality by replacing our comparison of life events to powerful legends, passed down through generations, with fast-fashion film and flimsy, commercialized tv?</p>

        <p>Before movies, people had plays, books and stories passed down. </p>
<p>I meant to mentally distance oneself from the events in a way that I can look at the situation like, “how’s this going to turn out?”. That’s how I sometimes have to handle the news. Otherwise I get overwhelmed with outrage of things looking like they are going to hell.</p>

        <p>Lie, of course! Put a local address, and fly down for the interview, if you get it. That’s how I got my out of state job (across country actually) in the recession. If a rule isn’t fair, break it.</p>

<p>They will ask for your id, and you get fired. You are lucky your employer didn't fired you for not having the wrong address.</p>

<p>Entry level jobs do not exist anymore except for commission only insurance sales. Even the mcjobs are impossible to be hired in. That type of job hunting where you call around restaurants for a job does not work anymore. Trust me, I've tried and all of them told me that they weren't hiring or after a application admitted that we have no openings!</p>
<p>The advice you gave me is incredibly outdated because the age of mass employment is long over.</p>

<p>However, I take issue with you telling the OP (my advice was to HIM, not to you) that you know for sure that he can’t find work if he leaves his abusive family situation. </p>
<p>People land entry level jobs all the time.

<p>YES, YOU CAN GET A MCJOB in a state that has a functioning economy.</p>
<p>You aren’t experienced enough to speak with that kind of authority. Also: why don’t you fucking try insurance sales? You need some moxie and that’ll help you develop it.</p>

<p>Its better for them to vent than to keep it to themselves only to snap and take their own lives when they get invalidated by society for not doing enough.</p>

<p>Amazon only hires you if you pass their personality quiz and 90 of the time, people who are competent at the job can fail.</p>
<p>&rt;You aren’t experienced enough to speak with that kind of authority. Also: why don’t you fucking try insurance sales? You need some moxie and that’ll help you develop it.</p>
<p>Insurance sales are commission only and no one will touch you with a 10 foot pole if you do have said job. These days its a resume killer. And I would not be qualified for one because I habe a developmental disablity.</p>
<p>And despite 10 years of IT/Linux Experince the field is oversaturated unless you know someone.</p>

        <p>Man I’m not shaming you. I just don’t think YOU have a right to spread your abject (and untested) negativity. It has an effect on people. And you just aren’t experienced enough in the job market (I can tell by your self pitying language) to be giving advice when that advice is “give up now dude it’s all over and the job market doesn’t exist anymore.”</p>
<ol>
<li>Insurance sales won’t kill your resume, that’s crazy talk. 2. Okay so it’s commission based - go out and make commissions Jesus chriiiiiiist 3. I’ve never known anyone not be able to get an amazon job. 4. You’re clearly used to higher paid work in IT and are upset you can’t find it, which is 10000% understandable but don’t tell this teenager that all is lost and he can’t get work in Florida just because YOU are in a painful mid-career transition. Don’t spread nonsense pessimism that isn’t even based in reality for this kid. What are you trying to accomplish besides making yourself feel better about not moving forward?</li>

        <p>Also my ex-con boyfriend got a job in a grocery store just by going in and talking to a manager. He was hired on the spot with no interview or application. That was just a couple months ago. We are in Oregon and the economy is shit here. But places are still hiring “essential” workers i guess bc everyone is scared? I dunno. But if you’ve convinced yourself you can’t find work <em>not matter what!</em> and that entry level work doesn’t exist anymore (huh??) then its possible you aren’t seeing the whole truth or the whole picture, much to your detriment.</p>

        <p>I can totally empathize and I have been there too but I believe we will pull out of this. Try to remember that there can still be good things that can happen again. I recommend the Victor Frankl book Man’s Search for Meaning about his experience of finding a way to survive even in a concentration camp. It helps me to put things in perspective.</p>

        <p>Do something nice for someone else, unwarranted. Make a sandwich and give it to a homeless person, tell someone you pass on the sidewalk that you like their shoes, write a nice note and stick it on someone's windshield - anything.  Also, if you have access to the outdoors take a long walk and focus on your breathing. Focusing on your breathing will help turn your mind inward and drown out the external, negative thoughts.</p>

        <p>Keep on living and piss off the people who caused the problem. Refuse to be afraid, refuse to hunker down at home and post cringey #staysafe silliness on twitter or wherever they're doing it, and just do the best you can. You have lots of time to figure out what you want to do, where to go. The number of people who are fed up will grow and it won't all last forever.</p>

        <p>Some things are worse than death. I have depression, and it makes each day a living hell under these lockdowns (I'm in CA, looks like the OP is in NY). The monotony is soul crushing.</p>

        <p>Is it bad over there, its not bad at all here in the UK, a few dumb measures the gov seem to make up on a 3 weekly basis. The virus over here keeps to timed schedules, only works in certain places and changes its mind a lot.</p>
<p>Our 'numbers' are low and hospitals still empty.</p>
<p>We just embrace the free things we can do, ignore what measures we can, wait for the idiots to change the rules yet again.</p>
