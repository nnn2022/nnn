        <p>This is terrifying. So many of these symptoms are VERY concerning and seem like autoimmune. As someone with three autoimmunes that all flared/presented/crashed me at once, doctors did not take me seriously when I was begging to be diagnosed because the sheer variety and severity of my symptoms was so unbelievable, they thought I was making it up or imagining it due to stress. I had to PROVE each of my symptoms (the ones I could). Some of these comments read like me at the time. Symptoms all over the map. My concern here is that the range of adverse reactions is so wide that IF they are ever really taken seriously on a mass scale, the steps we will take towards understanding them and the research will be very inefficient. Oof...</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this. The symptoms are very similar to what people who have actually had covid go through too. I agree that the vaccine seems to suppress your immune system or flare up underlying problems. I became alerted when so many of my clients were getting sick. 2 of them had heart attacks, another palpitations. I just had a lady who got the j&amp;j in this past week and she was swollen from head to toe. I'm so concerned she just didn't seem healthy. So many posters over at covid vaccinated say the same thing. They went to the Dr and all the tests came back normal. The Dr's not speaking out is a puzzle to me. It could be denial, trust in the group think. It could be fear of being called out, punished. I talked to a nurse the other day who said that even when patients were saying these things were happening after the shot the Dr's were not writing it in the patients notes, no mention of the vaccine. What happened to 'Do no harm'?</p>

        <p>&rt;It wasn’t the worst thing in the whole world but it was odd and uncomfortable, so I’m sharing this story as a cautionary tale/recommendation to not get acupuncture soon after your vaccine near where the needle went in!</p>
<p>Yes, the problem lies with the acupuncture needles and not the vaxx. I can't with these people!!!!!!!</p>
