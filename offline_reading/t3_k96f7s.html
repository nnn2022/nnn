    <strong>A list of suggestions for doubters.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve compiled a list of things to suggest to people who are starting to question all this.  All it is is a list of suggestions for research.  Feel free to use it. Feel free to add to it.  </p>
<p>“If you’re questioning all of this even a little bit here’s what I suggest you do. 
Look up the Great Reset.<br>
Look up the Communist Chart of Coercion.<br>
Look up the signs you’re in an abusive relationship.<br>
Look up the history of Bill Gates and what he’s all about. 
Look up the definition of propaganda. 
Look up the definition of brainwashing. 
Look up the history of the Holocaust and how it came about. 
Look up what’s really in that vaccine. 
Look up the occult meaning of masking people. 
Look up mRNA technology.<br>
Look up the Georgia Guidestones.<br>
Look up the difference between the words “from” and “with”.
Look up the peer reviewed documents that isolated the covid 19 virus. 
Look up the peer reviewed statistically sound studies that prove asymptomatic transmission exists. 
Look up when the covid test was developed. 
Look up what the creator of the test says about it.<br>
Look up the death rates for the last five years including this year. 
Look up the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
Look up what business the CDC is actually in.  </p>
<p>And then feel free to draw your own conclusions.  You’re still free to do that. For now.”</p></p>

        <p>I have quite a few acquaintances that are doubters. Surprisingly yesterday they were up in arms about the California restrictions, in particular the story of the woman crying because her outdoor patio is not okay but the movie-related (I’m not sure what exactly it is and don’t want to say the wrong thing) patio is open for dining. Both patios look exactly the same and are right next to each other, yet one is okay and one isn’t. The people I knew were upset about it, saying how these measures make no sense anymore and clearly aren’t rooted in logic. I think it’s the first step in waking them up to being anti-lockdowns, but it seems to be an effective place to start. If people haven’t seen this, they should.</p>

        <p>that video is pretty sad and compelling. and it's great that it was highlighted in this manner.</p>
<p>but what is needed is we all come together for liberty because it's only a matter of time before they come for you or me.</p>
<p>we don't need to agree on everything outside of basic liberties</p>

        <p>Hello Claud, i appreciate the effort but your list is very important and worthwhile but a bit advanced for "doubters".</p>
<p>for doubters, they need to first see the simple stuff.</p>
<p>"how many people do you know that have been hospitalized due to covid ".</p>
<p>if total death is relatively flat year over year, then everyone that has died this year, was going to die from something and therefore NO PANDEMIC.</p>
<p>we need to provide guidance for the logical steps to prevent people from jumping off a bridge. from questioning &rt; doubting &rt; researching &rt; speaking out.</p>

        <p>Right. I hear ya. But at this point I feel like all of that’s been tried. And it’s all a bit too small. Maybe these suggestions may wake someone up.  I don’t know, I just felt like I had to do something.</p>

        <p>What’s interesting is that prior to March 2020, the CDCs definition of a “pandemic” (as well as that of many worldwide health programs), is that it infects younger people and makes them ill and kills people who aren’t already in the age range of death. Any illness that kills people who are already at an average age of death does not qualify as a pandemic. </p>
<p>The definition of what exactly qualifies as a “pandemic” has been brought up a lot in discussions following the H1N1 panic that many scholars now describe as unfounded nonsense, while others claim that the low age of average infection and death made H1N1 unique enough to qualify as a pandemic despite overall low death rate in general.</p>
<p>So yes, 2.1-2.3 MILLION people over the age of 65 die every year in the US alone. If even 1/4 of those are also covid positive, we have a new category for cause of death, not a pandemic.</p>
