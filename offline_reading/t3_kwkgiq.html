    <strong>My daily rant about the hypocrisy</strong>
    <p><p>In these UnPrEcEdEnTed TiMeS, we see hypocrisy NoW MorE TheN EvEr. But this one just really grinds my gears. </p>
<p>So, I pulled my daughter out of virtual school and put her in a private, in-person school. What do we discover on her second day there? Welp, turns out that the children of the 3 loudest, doomerist teachers from her old school. </p>
<p>The ones who wear gloves, face shields, and 3 masks to the school board meetings just to fight for schools to stay safe. They literally said opening schools was “leading educators to slaughter.” The ones who begged for the vaccine, but once it became available to them, they said it was still to dangerous to be in the classroom. </p>
<p>These hypocrites actually pulled their own kids out of virtual, and enrolled them at the in-person private school. Funny how the private school teachers lives don’t matter. </p>
<p>I. Just. Can’t. </p>
<p>Thank you for listening to my hourly rage speech.</p></p>

<p>What do you expect? This has been the case for months now. This is common knowledge now, that people are hypocrites, and continue to break the rules (including those who set the rules) in order to satisfy themselves. I see it basically every day. Most of the time, these people will have each other's backs, too, they'll defend "their own" against the hypocrisy while chastizing those who are not in their inner circle. This includes the masses embracing celebs and politicians they like who break the rules, but not Average Joe. </p>
<p>None of this is surprising anymore. At least, I don't think you should be surprised by things like this happening. It's quite clear they are acting irrationally, and also not (sometimes simultaneously). The world is in the toilet right now.</p>

        <p>Oh I totally agree. Nothing is surprising anymore. This one really triggered me though. When will the madness end? </p>

        <p>Although I get very angry by this behavior, I also feel so little shock by it. I think it's desensitization after all the shit I've been through, both last year and in life as a whole.</p>

        <p>I think we all have a collective case of covid PTSD and desensitization to the crazy. It’s just like “oh, ok so I guess this is what we are doing now.” Nothing is shocking anymore.</p>
