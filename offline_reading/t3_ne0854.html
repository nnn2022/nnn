        <p>Haha well I suspect "normal" to you guys is watching youtube videos and reading crackpot websites, so I don't doubt that your lives haven't changed at all.  You were probably unemployed before this anyway as well.</p>
<p>My normal is doing outdoor activities and having bbqs in the backyard - all of which have remained as normal other than wearing masks when necessary, so yeah I've been living normally too.</p>

        <p>I walk without mask for 7 months, risking a 3-month salary fine, because I don't like anyone to interfere with my personal health choices, especially not governments. I only got challenged by Karens in supermarkets, no security staff or police ever talked to me.</p>
<p>On top of that, I stopped believing in germs making us sick after I understood the unproven scientism we call germ theory and virology. Germs are our friends. My covid19 lockdown time has been spent wisely. Knowledge is power. </p>
<p>What you call vaccines are full-fledged experimental gene therapy products, that normally require many years to develop, go under strict regulatory safety requirements, and would normally cost $100.000s per shot. What we have are unfinished clinical trials and emergency use "approvals" for 10-40 bucks. Skepticism should be the norm.</p>

        <p>Go fuck yourself COVID has taken many jobs in my hometown, and when places won’t allow a person outside even not in a business. Shut down an entire economy for a disease that has such a low death rate for healthy people, and then politicized the whole fucking thing, oh REPUBLICANS are attacking Asians because of corona, JOE BIDEN saved us with the vaccines and mask mandates, and keep setting a new fucking date every time, despite mask mandate ended counties death rates not exceeding the ones with them. WE Are against big pharma until we’re told we’re bad people who don’t care about life , so everyone should take a vaccine that has not been cleared by the fda, nor has any long term effect research been studied on them. Ad stranza gave people blood clots , and had to be pulled from the market. I WILL never trust the government as long as I live do to shit like the aids epidemic, vaccines gone bad in Africa, agent orange, the government sprayed our cities with deadly chemicals right after the polio epidemic ended, not a conspiracy, tobacco and abestos were said to be safe, healthy in fact, high concentrations of ddt poured in public pools to keep mosquitoes away,   I hate how people act like not wearing a mask is an ultimate resistance, and signifies something great, but we have no reason to trust them as everything they have said is a lie. The results are now we have kids whose anxiety and depression are sky high, suicide rates at an all time high, originally it was 2 weeks social distancing then 6 months with masks then now it’s been a year and a half and people are putting their foot down, because the government has not earned our trust back. ALOT OF PEOPLE claim   Let’s do this for the old people, then refused to care when the now former governor of New York sent people with COVID to die in nursing homes, that’s why New York’s nursing home death rates were so high. That man fucking murdered them and we are supposed to trust people like him. Then he only got removed from office for sexually harassment, instead of being charged with murder or even brought to court. Sorry for my long rant and no this isn’t alex Jones Reddit account have a good day.</p>
