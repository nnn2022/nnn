    <strong>Vaccines are not about you they’re about society. If you don’t want a new normal you should take the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I get it you think you’re low risk but this isn’t about you only. You benefit from being in a civilised society because of individual responsibility towards the community. Take that away and civilised and stable society collapses. </p>
<ul>
<li>The evidence is building that vaccines actually do prevent people from spreading the virus to a great degree. There was no evidence in the begging though, because there wasn’t enough time to build that evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>-It’s not about you or your immune system. You live within a society. </p>
<p>-The effect of long term tissue damage on Covid survivors is still unraveling. It’s not just about your survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>if not eradicated, then the risk of more dangerous mutations and repeat infections is a huge uncertainty. We still dont know if Covid will keep doing rounds chipping away at your health and causing permanent tissue damage every time.  There are signs this may be happening in Brazil already.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccine has been tested and it’s generally safe. As for the long term effects, it’s extremely rare for any chemical to cause a harmful long term effect from one small dose exposure. Medications that cause long term side effects are usually a result of multiple small exposures over a long time. Pretty much one can not get a vaccine one day and then suffer as a result 5 years on. It’s not how things generally work. It doesn’t make biological sense.</p>
<p>Yes some people in the short term however will suffer side effects, sometimes fatal, that’s very unfortunate and it’s a fact for all medicines, chemicals even foods like peanuts. But that’s a small minority compared to the destruction caused by the virus.</p>
<p>Look at Brazil, India, look at what can happen to the health system when this gets out of hand exponentially and you end up with people begging for oxygen whilst fighting to stay alive. </p>
<p>-Look at Israel. They’re close to going back to normal because of vaccines. No rise in cases or deaths.</p></p>

        <p>So the choices are that everyone get vaccinated, RIGHT NOW SO IT CAN END!!!</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>... There will be a new normal of mask mandates forever and lockdowns forever and 5 vaccinations a year with new strains, new media fear mongering and its all the fault of people who won't comply.</p>
<p>Most people here think that is propaganda being pushed by the known liars in the mainstream media and don't believe it.  We also aren't afraid and getting stressed about it, so we trust our own judgement over the average maskers judgement.  </p>
<p>The government is in the wrong here for mandating anything like this for so long.  So you think we should all be locked in cages, or shunned from society?</p>

        <p>Literally "we live in a society" lol.  </p>
<p>No healthcare professional or government agency has EVER said that it is possible to eradicate covid. Where did you get the idea that zero covid was even attainable? CDC has never said that.  </p>
<p>Our goal from the beginning has been to flatten the curve so we don't overwhelm hospitals while we build immunity from vaccine and infections.  </p>

        <p>It’s very interesting that prior to covid this magical hand holding united humanity/society speak was no where to be found. </p>
<p>Even during covid, I walk down the street and have my lung polluted by second hand smoke. We know cigarettes both to the individual, others around them, and the ecosystem are harmful and can be deadly. Where’s the unity in stopping the spread of cigarette sales? </p>
<p>There’s 100 more things I could list that we should be united on, I’m not making the comparison that because that isn’t currently being solved we should ignore Corona, no, what I’m asking is why is it magically we only care about Corona for “the bigger picture”? </p>
<p>There’s a level on un-ironic mass hypocrisy at play that I’ve seen. </p>
<p>The people I’ve seen with masks on their chin still puffing up a cigarette. The pro maskers and vaxxers that still eat disease ridden meats, chemically processed foods, invest their money directly or through stocks to funding companies that destroy the environment. There are much more pressing things than covid, and nobody united on these things. Why are we suddenly expected to sing Kumbaya and hold hands over covid? Because it kills people? I know of many activities, substances, MEDICINES, foods and beverages that kill people, and nobody significant seems to care about that. </p>
<p>This pro mask and vax talk isn’t about saving lives, it’s about your own moral quandaries. You want assurance that you’re pitching in to help save lives, but guess what, it’s too late. </p>
<p>The virus is already here in America, in this land of diabetes, this land of obesity. Everyone who did not consider their health, their children’s health, the health of the  people around them. You’re all at risk and it’s too late for you. </p>
<p>I don’t wish illness and poor health on people, I only recognize the presence of it, and I am sorry for what the virus is doing. I didn’t ask for it, but it’s cleansing out all the unfit people. </p>
<p>It is highly unfortunate yet simultaneously it’s not humanity-impacting enough (given that the people being affected are under 1%) for me and the rest of the world to conform to a new way of living. </p>
<p>If life itself was supposed to be about saving the lives of the weak, protecting those vulnerable. </p>
<p>Drinking and driving would exist, second hand smoke wouldn’t exist, people would be donating all their financial earnings to charity and fund raisers. We wouldn’t have all these lawyers and business man, everyone would have to be a doctor to save lives, we’d have less fast food chains and more hospitals and farms.  </p>
<p>When it comes to the personal choice of directly saving lives you cannot tell me that En mass people actually care, because the proof isn’t there. And for a virus that is only going to kill 1% of people, I’m not changing the entire way of life for that, you can call it selfish but I know there’s many things you have control over in your life that you’re being selfish for. I’m not going to make you conform to my way of living, and you should not try that on me. It’s not fair, but it’s freedom. </p>
<p>In life freedom should be higher priority than fairness, no matter the cost</p>

        <p>Anecdotally, I know a few anti-vaxxers and they all smoke.</p>
<p>Smoking is bad. It should end. Public smoking, near people is already banned or frowned upon and should stay that way. </p>
<p>However buying cigarettes as bad as it is, damages the person smoking only as long as they’re not smoking near others. It doesn’t have a societal effect like a pandemic, and it’s not multiplicative. It doesn’t require lockdown and destroying the economy.</p>

        <p>No, it’s actually you with that comprehension level. </p>
<p>You truly believe smoking is an individual blight and not one that affects the larger picture? </p>
<p>If we tally up the smoking related instances of cancer, first hand or second hand that alone is worse than covid. Now factor in all the uncorrelated cases that were obviously the result of something as poisonous as smoking the cancer sticks or being near them and the picture gets more dire. Do you think all these people getting ill from cigarettes are not part of the society you live in? Because they are, thus meaning that there is a societal impact for cigarettes. </p>
<p>NOW let’s add in to the societal impact not just the health but the wealth of people who smoke. The populous at large has many smokers with estimates being 1/3 of all adults. THEIR money, goes directly to the CEO’s. Ceos who then use this money for what? Is it all being invested back into charity? No, it’s being used to hire shady lawyers, biased scientists and doctors, underpay their employees (in relation to their salary) and in rare occurrences pay out settlements. For the opinion part of this I also believe they use this money to fund endeavours into the upper echelon, “buying their way into the club”. What club? The club of elites that literally do not care if you live or die, and even if you live they don’t care for your quality of life. They just need you able enough to be their servants, wether as customers or employees</p>

        <p>&rt;The vaccine has been tested and it’s generally safe. As for the long term effects, it’s extremely rare for any chemical to cause a harmful long term effect from one small dose exposure. Medications that cause long term side effects are usually a result of multiple small exposures over a long time. Pretty much one can not get a vaccine one day and then suffer as a result 5 years on. It’s not how things generally work. It doesn’t make biological sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10472327/">SV40 in contaminated Polio vaccines given between 1955 and 1961 cause many types of cancer. These are very long term effects from a very small dose. 98 million people were vaccinated with these contaminated vaccines.</a></p>
