    <strong>The absurdity of the third dose</strong>
    <p><p>In this thread I'm going to reflect on what the third dose is doing to humanity in my opinion</p>
<p>Note: I'm just some random teen who has English as his third language, this essay like rant isn't gonna be good at all points but it's worth to read</p>
<p>The people that just wanna be fully vaccinated because they see it as a trophy:</p>
<p>On tiktok I've seen people taking the third dose, however when looking at their pages I noticed it were people who used being vaccinated as a personality trait, this made me realize the people that we see as "the leftists who use being vaccinated and wearing masks their whole personality trait" have evolved. Since I don't have any interest in writing that whole sentence again I'm gonna call those attention seekers group A. Group A doesn't care about people dying from covid, the pandemic or going back to normal. They see the virus as a trend that they follow; if the media says you should drink 5 liters of alcohol to protect yourself against covid, they will drink those 5 liters of alcohol. I've seen that group A likes to keep things from the pandemic as a treat for later like the sticker they get from vaccinating. They have no singular thought about what the third dose can do for them. They just want to take it for the trend.</p>
<hr>
<p>Group B, the people that have already been vaccinated but pretend to be woke for the third dose</p>
<p>I would have never guessed this group existed if it wasn't for my family. Some of my family members have had both doses of the vaccine that they could get but they seem to skeptical about the third dose. I've seen them say stuff like "yeah this kinda feels like something that isn't safe" etc. It's crazy because they've already injected themselves with experimental fluids but they're skeptical if they have to do it a third time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Group C: Forced</p>
<p>I'm not gonna give this group a long name since you all already know what I mean when I say that they were forced, this is probably a group that comes from a leftist family that lives in a first world country but complains about it 24/7.</p>
<hr>
<p>The influence the groups have on each other:</p>
<p>Group C's family or people that force that group are a type of people that you would see on the news voluntarily talking about how its safe, you will also see them on social media, if these people never got attention or pulled attention to them group A wouldn't have been interested in vaccinating thus vaccine records drop. Group A and Group C may also change the mind of group B by saying that it's safe so they might also have an influence on people who are skeptical and make them unskeptical. </p>
<p>I think those are all the groups that exist, if there's more please add in the comments and I'll reflect on them, thanks for reading kind strangers</p>

        <p>There's a very good psychological rationale for Group B.</p>
<p>Our human brains hate being wrong. But even more than being wrong, we hate making an irreversible decision, and <em>then</em> being wrong. Since you can't get unvaccinated, you don't want to think that you made the wrong, irreversible decision. So you use Confirmation Bias to tell yourself you did the right thing.</p>
<p>And as such, Group B can be actually considered mRNA skeptics, in the sense that both don't want any more mRNA shots <em>from now on</em>.</p>
<p>I just talk to these people normally and don't bash them for having got 1 or 2 doses previously, when they had less info. No need to make them feel bad if we want them to keep being critical thinkers from this point onwards.</p>
