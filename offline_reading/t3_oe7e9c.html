    <strong>Me and my mom got Covid on April 2020. Slightly worse than a fever.</strong>
    <p><p>So, i am Italian and as a lot of you may know we were some of the first countries to encounter Covid.</p>
<p>My whole family got covid around april of the 2020 but only me and my mom had symptoms. We decided to treat it normally at home with the medicines we had, scared of what was happening in hospitals.</p>
<p>In the end in not even a week we were healthy. It was worse than fever on some aspects but we managed to cure it with normal medicines while people were literally getting killed with random treatments in hospitals.</p>
<p>Same happened with some friends which also cured it at home in a week or so at home.</p>
<p>I don't even know if treatments in hospitals changed now but if you are under 50 your immunitary system is likely enough to kill the virus.</p>
<p>Media are trying to make the virus seem like the worst in history while unless you are old it is just a fever.</p>
<p>Also don't you think it is strange that after this "pandemic" any death was because of it? Literally any other disease just disappeared from the planet.</p>
<p>Don't trust the masses, learn from your experience and always remind government isn't with us but against.</p></p>

        <p>Glad you beat it. Must have been scary having it when it was new / unknown how likely you were to survive.</p>
<p>Hope to visit Italy again someday as long as vaxxports don't become the norm.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sadly those damn "green passes" now are becoming the norm and everyone is making the vaccine to have it. </p>
<p>They all talk about finally having freedom but what really is the point? They still have to weark masks, having distance and all that shit...</p>
<p>You can still make a test to see if you are positive, but spending 20€ for it Everytime is a steal and that's likely  just to convince you even more to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Hopefully all this will change and we will finally be able to travel again ❤️</p>

        <p>You were <strong>diagnosed</strong> with Covid-19, but as you described all you had was a minor fever. There is no evidence this was caused by the alleged virus Sars-Cov-2.</p>

        <p>Probably you are forgetting how younger people are for the majority asymptomatic or with very few effects usually, as i said it was worse than a fever, but not that letal as medias try to make it seem.</p>

        <p>Still doesn't change the fact that none of the tests being alleged to detect Sars-Cov-2 actually do, and the markers they do detect have never been demonstrated to be specific to Sars-Cov-2. This is because to prove they are indicative of Sars-Cov-2 you actually have to prove the existence of it first.</p>

        <p>Treatments in hospitals did change. Because they tell people who catch it nowadays to not go to the hospital unless it is severe.</p>
<p>At the beginning they didn't know what to do. They did not even know if asymptomatic spread is a thing. People got rushed into the hospital for symptoms that aren't much more sever than a strong flu, they got put on ventilators, because then they have more staff available to treat others. Someone on a ventilator needs minimal treatment, cause the machine now does it. But breathing through a tube itself isn't without risk and it doesn't even make your case better.</p>
<p>If you get a serious CoViD case and get a blood clots or inflammation in your lungs, the vent doesn't help you.</p>
<p>Many people died because they didn't treat it right. If you went to an hospital during the height of the pandemic, you weren't better off than if you stay at home. If your Dr doesn't know how to treat you, but has to rush it cause of an high amount of patients, you will probably be worse off.</p>

        <p>It was all a psy op, the way they mishandled the early cases. To make it easier for people to accept all the later craziness. They needed high death count and will defend it and reuse it for as long as needed. Italy, NY, China, Spain. All those put on a show tp terrify the world.</p>

        <p>Hey! I had it April 2020 as well! Mine was bad, real bad. I had very severe symptoms and ended up in hospital. My wife, who was pregnant at the time, couldn't distinguish between her pregnancy symptoms and her covid symptoms and my children had slightly runny noses.</p>
<p>My illness lasted an entire month. I had fevers that went up to 104.5 then I would wake up with hypothermia, literal hypothermia, my temperature was 93. The virus spared my lungs but attacked my blood and my kidneys which still gave me difficulty breathing, something about fluid buildup around my lungs. The virus also attacked my ability to produce testosterone. I had no sense of smell or taste and I had no appetite. My muscles and joints ached and my head pounded. </p>
<p>There were moments that I genuinely believed I was going to die. While I was in hospital the doctors gave me the choice of dying alone in hospital or dying with my family in my bed. They told me because the virus was attacking my blood and causing it to clot in a very peculiar way there was no chance for them to save me if I stroked out. I chose to go home and I guess I got lucky.</p>
<p>To this day my joints still hurt. I am no longer sick and haven't been for a year but my joints still hurt. I don't believe in long covid, I actually think it's stupid but I do believe this virus can wreck your body in lasting ways, long after it's gone. For some people it's like a wrecking ball that just smashes its way through and does as much damage as it can while your body fights it off.</p>
<p>In many ways I'm happy that I went through that and it turned out okay and I am happy that my family went through that successfully because having naturally antibodies is, I think, the best way to do it. When I got better it was like this weight was lifted off of me. I no longer gave a single fuck about this pandemic, I had been so scared and taken all the precautions and I still got sick so I figured I did my time and I wasn't going to be afraid anymore.</p>

        <p>Had it in March 2020. Worst was muscle soreness that you'd get from the flu. Lasted 3-4 days and Sudafed made most symptoms unnoticeable. Quarantined 21 days which is probably most than any doomer would even though they assume unvacinnated people go around handing covid like candy.</p>
<p>I've cought some sort of flu superbug from uni years back and that one was a lot worse than covid.</p>

        <p>I’m glad that you and your family only had mild symptoms but sadly this doesn’t happen to everyone. The hospitals don’t kill the people but they can’t help everyone. Sometimes the virus is just too strong and the body too damaged for people to be saved. </p>
<p>Media aren’t trying to make the virus seem like the worst in history. But they show that it definitely is one of the most severe ones and has to be taken seriously. </p>
<p>Nobody says that every death is because of Covid. There are people dying from other reasons, too. The media just mostly talks about COVID deaths because it is relevant. Other diseases did not disappear. They are just talked about less. But some diseases like the flu actually had less cases which is due to the fact that it is airborne and spread less because of masks and social distancing. </p>
<p>You can’t just learn from your own experience because everybody reacts different. If a persons experience was that multiple people in their family died would that mean that everybody dies? No, because you have to look at a lot of cases to get a picture of the whole situation. </p>

<p>You mean, like the creator of mRNA who says that the vaccine is shit? Or Dr. Richard Fleming?</p>
<p>I do trust them.</p>
<p>But i DO NOT trust people without any medical experience (the government) or the media (which has a personal interest to lie to you) or Big Pharma companes (who also are biased and have a personal interest to lie to you).</p>
<p>The question is: Why do YOU not trust them? Why do you trust some guy on the tv more than actual experts and scientists?</p>

<p>Do you know how scientists advance their careers? They compete for grants from govt and pharma backed institutions. Those institutions give grants to research that benefit their financial and political interests. Scientists are not divine beings, they are human and as such are just as vulnerable to manipulation and corruption as anyone else.</p>

        <p>&rt;Nobody says that every death is because of Covid</p>
<p>the UK government data says that every death counts as CoViD if it happened within 28 days of a CoViD infection.</p>
<p>Misleading and lying media and screwed government data is surely a reason why this pandemic went so badly. They are responsible for many deaths. They even lied about treatments (HCQ lie that had to get retracted).</p>

        <p>No if you are old the risk is actually high and you may have serious problems, but young people rushing to vaccinate while the majority of times they will be asymptomatic or have it only as a slightly worse fever? It blows my mind that people with such a strong immunitary system want so much to be lab rats.</p>

        <p>Getting vaccinated with the Covid jab does neither protect YOU from the virus nor ANYONE ELSE since you can still spread it. What is the fucking point of taking an experimental shot that doesn't stop the spread? Have you thought that far? We're talking strictly Covid here, not something else.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, the same vaccine which:
is still sperimental, 
has still a very high chance to infect others,
has no real effect with the majority of variants, 
has killed and gave side effects to a lot of people,
has made pioneers of the mRNA technology suspicious</p>
<p>and is literally stated how we don't know ANYTHING of possible side effects overtime.</p>
<p>No thanks, my immunitary system has already killed it one time and it is way more trustworthy ;)</p>

        <p>I am pretty sure you have finger to type it right on google, but really i have to legitimate those which are literally obvious, you hear and see every second of them unless you lived under a rock through the whole pandemic. The only thing i can accept is the mRNA pioneers being suspicious, so here you go just search about one of them which got suspended from socials for saying what he knew.</p>
<p>Also why don't you give me a reason of why i should believe all the immense propaganda while i already passed this virus and people are literally getting billions of vaccine shot because it is ineffective with all the new variants?</p>
<p>Sheeps like you don't really ask a few questions themselves and just trust the masses, the government, the propaganda and never dig more to see if what they know is the truth.</p>
<p>Even after this you will not care and just be very happy of getting sperimental substances in your blood, well happy for you too! You can't make an ostrich think sadly, all this will be wrote on history books remind it.</p>
