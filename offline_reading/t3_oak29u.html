        <p>My father in law began wasting away shortly after having the vaccine in March. Early this month he went to the doctors and they find his blood sugar levels are all messed up and they have him on insulin now. From a active, healthy middle age man to a diabetic in the course of 3 months.</p>

        <p>Two of my mom’s friends died suddenly of advanced stage cancer within the past 3 months. Another just diagnosed with late stage prostate cancer and given 40% chance to live. Grandparents who are 87 made it fine through covid now aren’t doing so great. My brother now has pancreatitis and someone else I know from school has tinnitus, all shortly after getting the shot</p>

        <p>This is a real story from Canada, Québec. </p>
<pre><code>    Last weekend, a friend of my girlfriend came over to chat with us. We had some wine and we spoke for a few hours. She is vaccinated and for it 100% so is her family. So the conversation at some point turns to her beloved uncle who was basically her dad because her dad wasn't there. He passed away at 53 of a heart attack on May 4th despite being healthy. Her aunt came back home and found him eyes opened, all purple and rigid (riggo mortis) in the bedroom.

     The doctor sees the obvious signs of a heart attack, rules the death as one, he gets incinerated they have the usual sad funerals.

     I subtly try to bring into the conversation the question, out of curiosity, was her whole family vaccinated. Yes they are, her mother uncle and aunt all went together, then the cousins and herself. I open the goddamn vaccination calendar in Québec, April 30th is the day it opened for 50-59 yo !!!!!!!! Means the guy got vaccinated and died between 1-4 days after it from a heart attack. People believe it's so safe that none  of her family even thought it could be linked !?!?! Not even the fricking doctor !!!!! We can't say for sure and well never know but wtf if nobody is looking for it how many people could this happen to without anyone thinking it's linked to the vaccine?? 1-4 days after the vaccine I mean that's a lightning strike coincidence....
</code></pre>
<p>Stay safe and stay off the vaccine, if you want it is your choice but please wait a while and see what happens if you are going to take it. 6months-1year and well know whats to know.</p>
