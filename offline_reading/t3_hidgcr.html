<title>Audio message on public transportation says "wear a mask out of respect of other passengers", instead out of public health. Because they know the science was never on their side and mask wearing is nothing but politics and a religious belief in novel IFR</title>

        <p>Currently on underground. I don’t have any respect for these easily manipulatable idiots who want the government to micromanage their lives. So I’m good.</p>
<p>Edit: BTW was this London/UK? Because it's exactly the same here. "Out of respect for others" I didn't see anyone respecting my point of view the past three months.</p>
<p>Respect is earned and I have no reason to respect these people. Haven't worn a mask since the first day they implemented it and not one person has said a thing. I'm not the only one either. Don't do it.</p>

        <p>I was behind a lady in line at the gas station yesterday... She was on the phone, and telling whoever that such and such had only smoked half a cigarette since they got off the plane... She then proceeds to turn around and look at me, and says, “Oh, I’m sorry I don’t have a mask on. I promise I had one on on the plane”... I looked confused, and said, “I really don’t care. I don’t have one on either”... When I got to the cashier, I said, “If I was looking a certain way, it was only because she was on the phone while trying to check out with you”!! We both laughed</p>
