    <strong>Dealing with friends who think aliens are responsible for the covid vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I once stood in a garden with friends and told them the future lol. They laughed, I laughed and I forgot all about it. Most of what i said came true or looks to soon be true around the world. (We havn't got to the part where cash is frowned upon because it's unsanitary. But i was correct on the rest.) </p>
<p>Lets be clear. Even though everyone i know, apart from a one person has had the jab. Most couldn't care less that i havn't and thats why they are good friends. The one person who like me hasn't. i try not to discuss it with, because she thinks its all linked to the secret space program called solar warden and that there is a micro chip in the vaccine. I shit you not!</p>
<p>I don't believe any of the crap she comes out with. i just don't want the jab. MY CHOICE! My question is how many of these people with extreme views make up the anti covid vaccine people . just curious. i would imagine very few but what do you guys think? So my question is:  <strong>How do you deal with these guys?</strong></p>
<p>Also. </p>
<p>If pushed to support a theory this would be mine:</p>
<p>They overeacted!</p>
<p>The goverments of the world saw the chinese propaganda they released to their own people of randoms falling over and convulsing and believed it. They turned to people who's job it was to safe guard against a serious biological threat and they rolled out what we have now.</p>
<p>Now whats more likey: Every goverment in the world say: "Uhhhh sorry guys we made a mistake. this will only effect the vunrable, old, and possible one percent of the healthy population we'll vax them and the rest of you be careful around them so as not to overload the health system. maybe keep them locked down. Sorry and uhhhhhh carry on..................."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Realising they just can't admit they are wrong. Then realising that they should never let a good crisis go to waste and implement I.D. cards and other stuff. As for china? Well i think someone said the chinese have a 50 generational plan ( im not sure if this is bull) but if they have this is a good start lol</p>
<p>anyway that my thought on the matter</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thanks guys be nice to each other x</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry, but I honestly think the Solar warden theory is more plausible than yours, and it's not plausible at all.</p>
<p>Wake up and smell the coffee, my friend. This is a deliberate plan being carried out, and most of our leaders have an assfull of China cock.</p>
<p>They aren't dumb or naive, but the majority of people are.</p>
<p>There is a need to thin out the herds, and I honestly think this is a very clever way of doing it.</p>
