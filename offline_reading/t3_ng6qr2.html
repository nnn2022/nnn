        <p>Because those people don't comprehend the term "science". And that's also why they were screaming "trust the science" in the first place even though if science was something you're supposed to trust, it would be called religion instead. There.</p>

        <p>That’s what blows my mind. Theres a general lack of understanding of what “the science” is. It’s not something you believe in. You can believe in the scientific process, which if uncorrupted is absolutely legit and powerful. But “the science” is not what they think it is.</p>

        <p>Everyone say it with me, an American has the choice to practice religion, in any way they want. An American has a duty to follow a mandate from someone with more expertise than them on the subject IF it endangers others. For example, if you want to do something without negatively affecting anyone else go ahead. If you endanger people around you by just being there and you can prevent it, either do so or stay isolated until you do.</p>

        <p>Say it with me, I am not infected until proven clean. Your irrational fears cannot and will not impede my freedom of movement or liberty. I am not a danger by merely existing without a proven useless mask. Germapobia and Agoraphobia are mental disorders. For me to play into those also indicates I have a mental disorder.</p>

        <p>It’s psychology.</p>
<p>We have an instinctual bias to fear things that are not “normal” to us, particularly when we’ve been conditioned to believe that “normal” is safe, and “abnormal” is dangerous.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, imagine you’re an American used to driving in the right side of the road, and you suddenly had to drive on the “wrong” side of the road on a vacation in the U.K.—you’d go through a period where you were extremely uncomfortable driving on the “wrong” side of the road, because you’ve been conditioned to believe that doing that is dangerous.</p>
<p>After a few days, you’d get used to the idea.</p>
<p>Then, when you got home to America, you’d go through the same process reconditioning yourself to drive on the right side of the road.</p>
<p>For people like the OP asks about, it’s the same thing: they’ve been conditioned to believe that the virus is an existential threat, and that masking is the only thing standing between them and death.</p>
<p>It’s going to take them awhile to get over that psychological hump. The best thing that we can do is to ignore them, continue not wearing masks, and carry on with our lives.</p>

        <p>The virus is a threat. It harms people, therefore it is a threat. Please make an effort to protect others around you. Your beliefs are your beliefs, but if they harm others when it could be avoided then it should be changed. I’ll be hospitalized for anywhere between 2 weeks and the rest of my life if if I get COVID. Many people suffer immune system disorders and COVID-19 can harm us in ways it can’t harm the rest of the population.</p>

        <p>Short answer: No.</p>
<p>Long answer: You’re free to live in a bubble if it’s what you think that you need to do in order to protect yourself, but you’re not free to violate the personal autonomy of others. If you’re so worried about the virus, perhaps you should avoid spending time in public, and get yourself a Racal suit (or similar) for those rare times when you need to venture out.</p>

        <p>Several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They feel that if they take off their mask, people may misjudge their political beliefs</li>
<li>They have a white-collar office job and never missed a paycheck and like working from home and don't want go back</li>
<li>They feel that this summer will be non-stop parties for people that were restricted from parties over the past year and know they won't be invited to any of them</li>
<li>They've been extremely pro-vaccination since the vaccines have become available, but they're afraid of needles and/or side effects; they think they can be part of the 30% that don't get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. They don't want people to know they never actually got the shot</li>

        <p>It was never about science, health or safety...it was always about showing their moral superiority by virtue signalling their mask obedience and they are so obedient (aka morally superior) that they are wearing masks even when they don't need to.</p>

        <p>Well no, there was scientific data and research to show that masks and distancing were beneficial.</p>
<p>At this point if they still mask up they’re denying science, doesn’t make the denial on the other side any less denial</p>

        <p>I always thought mask wearing was a copout for doing something meaningful for others. Suddenly a selfish populous who couldn't be bothered to help other people or make sacrifices for their community before discovered a way that they could, while media and advertising applauded them. That ground is hard to give up.</p>

        <p>Their brains are broken and they let it happen.</p>
<p>Left leaning Liberals used to say shit like, "Question authority. Question everything." What happened to that mentality?</p>
<p>What made me feel crazy over this last year, was the fact that no one I knew, none of my family, none of my friends, no one around me asks questions anymore. I stood up and started shouting, "<em>Why am I the only one asking questions?!</em> Why did they let inmates out of jail to 'slow the spread' but tell everyone else to stay indoors to 'slow the spread'? Why are we still taking advice from someone who admitted to lying to the American people and the world? Why are people who were adamantly against the vaccine because it was developed under the Bad Orange Man now screaming at people to get that same vaccine? If you got the vaccine, and it works, why do you care what anyone else does? If the vaccine doesn't work, why did you get it? Why is no one else asking questions?!?!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, I fear everyone around me has been replaced by pod-people and somehow I evaded them.</p>

        <p>To me, that's all the proof needed to expose this as  political coercion rather than on unbiased scientific findings.</p>
<p>They want to rid the political residue of the last administration in the attempt to gain power and influence over fringe voters and they don't care if that entails the total infliction of psychosis on the masses.</p>
<p>They want division and are ready and willing to tear down the social fabric of society to achieve it.</p>

        <p>I think some of these people are probably extremely anxious people (I see the mask thing a lot in the r/anxiety sub) that are so scared, self conscious and want lockdowns continued indefinitely. They just want everyone else to suffer along with them because even before the pandemic they were too scared to go out and do anything. So they’re not really losing anything, but just bringing everyone else down to their level of being a shut in. </p>
<p>Others I’ve seen are on pro communism subs that are overjoyed with how this is affecting the economy and want to see it all crash and burn, even though the only ones really getting hurt through this are mainly small businesses while the big ones rake in tons of money. They cheer on posts on McDonald’s offering higher wages, though most of them still think it’s beneath them and won’t work there, especially as long as the government keep handing them out money.</p>

        <p>No. it significant reduces SYMPTOMS. </p>
<p>You are jumping to saying less symptoms=less chance of spreading it but wasn’t this virus advertised as an asymptomatic spreader? </p>
<p>If you have a source that says the vaccine severely reduces the likelihood of transmission. I would take a look at it.</p>
<p>Because so far, all I’ve heard from the mainstream media is that it only reduces symptoms.</p>

<p>5800 out of 77m have re-contracted the virus after vaccination. I think that would qualify as reducing the likelihood of transmission. I prefer to share this statistic as it makes those who are vaccinated look even more stupid when they demand I get vaccinated due to theirs and others “safety”.</p>

With every issue, they try and make you concede to their will; not because it's right or wrong, but because they want the submission.  Every thing you grant them a win on becomes the fuel for their next demand, which is why you can never submit and you must never apologize, because it'll NEVER be enough, ever.</p>

        <p>It's very interesting that you continue to use this alt account, rather than your standard one, when it's the easiest thing in the world to do to demonstrate your inquiry is sincere.</p>
<p>this is how it's becoming crystal clear you're just a concern troll, and as a rule I don't feed trolls, so either move to your main, or become disappointed when you get no further replies.</p>

        <p>Nothing they say is accurate. That's why they didn't want to give you a source, because they don't have one. I used to be a Trump supporter and even when I posted  on the The_Donald everyday mostly agreeing with things, I was always called a concern troll, bot, shill, etc the few times I challenged someone. You have to agree with them on everything or else you're a sheep. Strange, because doesn't never questioning anything make you the sheep?</p>
<p>Republicans and democrats are two sides of the same coin. They both have extreme bias and lash out the same way when questioned. It's weird they can't see that. How are you calling others brainwashed when you flip out the moment this person asked for a source?</p>
<p>Instead of continuing to argue right after saying you don't reply to trolls, you could have gave proof and been done with it. But you got nothing. How are you different from the fake news you scream about?</p>

        <p>It's not that I don't want to, it's that I refuse to waste time with concern trolls, and it's like 110% likely that 'agoldenrage' is one, given it's low comment/karma count on a 7 year account.</p>
<p>Can't tell you how many times I've spent the time to link a half dozen sources, only to have them all blanket dismissed by an ideologue that was never interested in the first place.</p>
<p>I mean, you account appears to be legit, why don't YOU try asking me?</p>
<p>Also, I very much doubt you were a Trump supporter, as the number of people I've seen on this site claiming to be a former Trump supporter outnumbers the amount of ACTUAL supporters on this site.</p>

        <p>I had like 40k karma on T_D but I don't care if you doubt it or not. I went to his rallies filled with Chaldean trump supporters only to see him deport them once he took office. Both sides are disgusting. It's either "let police kill anyone with immunity" or "abolish prisons". This country will collapse because extremism has infiltrated both parties. It's choosing between a Qult or the party of 600 genders.</p>

        <p>It's interesting that you won't even ask the question yourself when prompted to do so, and it's become a habit to do due diligence on people who are suspect concern trolls.</p>
<p>I typically find that people who respond with "could you cite that?" or "could you tell me more about that?" aren't people who are actually interested, they're just looking for things to quote mine for retorts, to which they'll say "that source is alt-right" or "here's a semantic argument that demonstrates you're wrong".</p>
<p>I get that someone who's been deluded by the 'both sides are equally wrong' fallacy wouldn't grasp that, because typically they're not inquisitive enough to see the disparity, but here's something that'll make it crystal clear to you:  I'm going to give the other guy a couple links, and I want you to see if u/agoldenrage actually has anything meaningful to say, of if their response will be nothing but them trying to poke holes.  That way it's a win-win for me:  either I'll get a decent reply from him, or I'll have proven my premise was right from the start.</p>

        <p>Hmm, now why would you reply to THAT on THIS tangent of the thread?  Could it be that u/agoldenrage and u/mallie66 are in fact the same person, and simply forgot to swap back?</p>
<p>Also, kudos for doing exactly what I knew you'd do and attack the messenger.  I mean, you could've just gone through the links in the articles for the source material to see if the premise was sound or not... but why do that when you can just say "you're biased and use biased sources".</p>
<p>THIS is why I didn't want to talk to you.  Also, there's been no auto-mod; maybe the filter you've installed to clear out conservative media outlets is what triggered... much like your tender sensibilities.</p>
<p>How about this:  address the arguments in the articles INSTEAD of just blanket dismissing them; if they're so false, you should have no problem, right?  Sucks to have the ball in YOUR court, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Just keep thinking you've got it all figured out, and that the people who disagree with you are the brainwashed ones... I'm sure that'll work out super well for you.  Would you like if I bought you a plane ticket to go over there and talk about how you support them AND gay rights?

        <p>I agree with the left on some issues and agree with the right on other issues. Learning to see different sides of things is a good way to think freely. Maybe you think in black and white terms (either 100% with something or 100% against it) but not everyone is like that.</p>
<p>Do I support Hamas? Nope. Do I think every act of violence committed by Israel should be excused because "they're fighting terrorism?" Nope. Do I think they should own whatever land they want? Hell no. Does Palestine have problems? Yes, but kids should not be getting killed. I'm for freedom. I'm not in lockstep with leftists, especially since Biden is openly supporting Israel.
Conservatives love to point to Palestine's lack of gay rights as evidence they're the bad guys. Which is funny because conservatives are pretty anti-gay with all the "gay agenda" and "alphabet mafia" talking points but it's only bad when the muslims do it right? While you're ragging on their intolerant culture, know that you can't even move to Israel unless you're one certain religion. Seems intolerant doesn't it?</p>
<p>Agreeing with a political party on certain issues does not make someone part of that party. It's calling forming your own opinion. Something you are incapable of understanding because you're a victim of propaganda. I do apologize for calling you brainwashed earlier. It appears I was wrong and you never had one to begin with.</p>
<p>Am I for gay marriage? Yep. Do I think there are 500 genders? Lol. Do I think trans kids should be normalized? NO. I'm not lockstep with liberals on these issues because I think for myself. Try it sometime.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask let people feel virtuous (stay home, save lives; mask up) without having to put forth an effort, and it gave them a common enemy (anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers) to build a common cause around.  These people are complete losers who have never achieved anything in their lives.  Now that it is gone, they have even less meaning in their lives.</p>

        <p>Okay serious answer. None of the vaccines have been approved for children under the age of 12. Everyone who says "it's just like the flu" isn't grasping the concept of over half a million people died from it in one year. Now people who are vaccinated are safe but those kids are not and all the unvaccinated people are not either. We are trying to save your lives and the lives of millions of children... not sure what else to say that should really be enough. We are not stupid sheep we just care about other people too.</p>

<p>This self-righteous shit right here.</p>
<p>Let's get one thing straight: <strong>nobody asked for your concern</strong>.  </p>
<p>Who put you on a big fucking pedestal and said you're here to save the lives of others?  Why isn't it the responsibility of healthcare professionals or the government - who by the way are far more fucking qualified to administer policies and healthcare than some rando on the internet.</p>
<p>You want to save lives?  Go to a soup kitchen and feed the homeless.  Go to an animal shelter and make sure the animals get adopted.  Go to the inner city and educate the children so they understand how social mobility will get them out of the cycle of poverty. <br>
 Go to a third world country where the children are little more than skin and bones and make sure they are vaccinated for the things that are more likely to kill them than COVID.  </p>
<p>Don't tell me that putting a dirty piece of cloth on your face and getting a shot is what Jesus would have done.  Because near as I can tell, he would have actually lifted a fucking finger to DO shit for other people.  </p>
<p>This "we care about other people" shit could be expressed in more ways than just concern over COVID, but I'd be willing to bet that COVID is the first, and probably the only time you've ever gotten on your high horse about "saving lives".  </p>
<p>So yeah, take a fucking seat, all right?</p>

        <p>So 1. you don't know me or what I do in my life. 2. How many lives have you saved? 3. If you put that much effort into being a decent human being instead of trying to prove that I'm scum like you then the world would be a better place. Also you say I should go to third world countries and teach so I'm qualified for that but not qualified to speak about why people want to keep masks on... you might have missed something there. 
Look I'm not trying to prove you wrong or make you feel like shit for being an aweful person I'm answering a question someone asked in the best way I can.</p>

        <p>The science says not wearing a mask but vaccinated is low risk. It’s even lower risk to be vaccinated and wear a mask. Maybe people don’t want to get sick?</p>

        <p>I am currently in an ongoing argument with my wife because of this. I've been tired of sitting around on my ass for over a year, having to cancel our gym membership because it was "too dangerous". So today, after work, for the first time in a year and a half I went for a 4 mile run. My wife freaks out that I'm being too reckless. "What if you run in someone's exhaled breath???" That's a verbatim quote. My response is that the CDC.... I'm interrupted that she doesn't want to hear about the CDC and that it's just a government institution and that the government lies. So why should we believe them when they say it's safe to spend time outside without a mask? I respond that it's those same fucking government agencies that YOU listened to over a year ago causing us to shut down our lives. Now she's pissed at me, and upset. I just can't handle it anymore. I want to be concerned for her feelings, but she's so goddamned scared and gaslighted by all of this that I can't break through. And I'm the selfish one apparently. Maybe I'm just going to be REALLY selfish and she'll see how much I've been holding back all this time. She's fully vaccinated and I'm partially vaccinated, so it makes her position even more ridiculous</p>

        <p>The better question is why do people on this sub trust the CDC when they say it's okay to take off masks (which is still just for vaccinated people which probably doesn't include anyone here) but you didn't trust anything else they've said, especially when they told everyone to wear masks in the first place?</p>

        <p>Pretty sure the majority here has never  actually trusted anything the CDC has said at any point.   People in this sub (for the most part) believe it's been a farce since the beginning, so their thoughts on CDC Guidance is irrelevant.</p>
<p>That's not the question though.  The question is this:  There are people out there who literally scream at people to wear masks, and yell at people to 'trust the science' and have made the last year or so their virtue signalling to just trust what the government is telling us.  Now that it's all waning, these same people who have literally yelled at people to trust the government are now refusing to do so.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's the part I genuinely am interested in hearing about.  What made you turn your back on 'the science' and continue to wear a mask?</p>

        <p>I think (i have no proof) that its just a maner of who is seen and heard.
Because i think that in EVERY "community" there are extremely loud and stupid people.
Now this is true for "anti vaccine" even the "science believers" there are people who dont actually understand what they say, they just do it because everyone they now did it, and especially thees people are the kind to scream there believes no matter if they're rigt or wrong.</p>

        <p>I doubt you’re looking for a legit answer, but I’ll give you one. </p>
<p>Some places here still require masks inside (university, some shops, etc.). It’s also a really small inconvenience for me to just toss one on before running in somewhere as a “why not” precaution for anyone that still is at risk/concerned and for me. </p>
<p>Mainly because it is such an extremely small inconvenience for me and it can helps others and it gives me another layer and it’s about half and half if a building requires it or not.</p>
<p>It’s literally more work for me to find out if a building requires it or not than it is to just put it on lol.</p>

        <p>The science is telling us that fully vaccinated people can take off their masks.  But as the participants in this sub show, non-vaccinated people are going to take advantage of that change as well, which leads to additional questions.  Just like at the start of this thing, things are being studied in real time, and so they change often which makes it difficult for people to keep up.  </p>
<p>Luckily the latest studies are showing that vaccinated people are protected from the unvaccinated as well, which opens up the idea of letting everyone do what they feel is best for themselves and people only harming themselves.  But these things take time to work out details.  We are making great progress but it still requires patience.</p>

        <p>But if unjabbed people are taking advantage of it they are only risking each other, not the vaxxed ones per CDC guidance.  Hence if you've been jabbed, the science states you can pretty much run naked through a stadium filled with people without risk of infection (although I don't recommend that test)</p>

        <p>Well not exactly, but close enough.  That only came out in the last week though.  For reference, look at when they recommended no masks first and then masks later.  How long did it take people to adapt to that change?  Some still haven't a year later.  So this one which has more detail involved may take people more than a week to get up to speed with.</p>

        <p>I'm sure it had occurred to the CDC, before they removed the mask requirement, that unvaccinated people were going to lie about it.  And even taking that into account, they deemed it safe to make the announcement.</p>
<p>It's just funny how people trust the CDC blindly when putting restrictions on us but then as soon as they start to loosen them, suddenly they can't be trusted to make such decisions.</p>

        <p>It doesn't make people immune, it makes them less likely to catch it and become seriously ill with it. So if only a small number of people get vaccinated then this shitshow is going to keep carrying on.</p>
