    <strong>I dived into why No New Normal Ban hates us and well let's just say it was as I expected</strong>
    <p><p>So I thought the other day I'd go into that sub and really ask why they hate us and well some responses were well expected. Apparently all we do is spread misinformation, get people killed with our "opinion", they think their side is right and when you try to find out why someone hates you apparently you're an attention whore.</p>
<p>While the experiment was interesting it was sad. These are the same people that just only care about the numbers. I don't think they bother to take into account how one does feel about masks, restrictions, etc. To them if you can't "adapt" to the restrictions you're wrong. It's almost like all they do just take the government or the CDC's words and that's it. That's the "fact" they use against us because their "facts" are from "authority". I doubt anything they say their pouring their heart and soul into their posts. They post links that are "facts" that their precious search engines give them. </p>
<p>I am sure I could Google "are masks good for you" and find pages flooded with "facts" why they are. It would be a lot harder to find a link that would explain why some shouldn't wear a mask. The "information" the left find to use against us is either cleared by social media or haven't been taken down by the government. To say there is only one side where the "science" is the facts by jabbing people unwillingly, making people distant from each other, making people not want to interact with each other in person unless it's over Zoom and just taking the human element out of the equation.</p>
<p>Even if everything they say is right based on "science" when does "science" become dangerous for everyone's mental health? Do they even give mental health a thought? If the conditions of life end up being restricted because they think it's good for our health is it really the right way to live? Just throw everyone's feelings out the door because of "science" it isn't good to feel? It's just so frustrating and it's not even when I hear it from them. It's when I hear it from the average person in support for masking and restrictions. That they say it's all for our health when it's just making everyone more miserable. </p>
<p>Is it really worth it that in order to be "safe" we have to give up everything if "science" comes out and says we need to be mindless if it's "for the greater good". I don't know doesn't sound like the kind of life I want to live if you ask me.</p></p>

        <p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257385v1 actually.. masks don't do shit. It's false security which is what continues the spread of this virus. It's all total bullshit and the truth will come out soon. We don't need a vaccine for something that kills 0.03% of humans ..</p>

        <p>Agreed and some of it is already. For instance what was once a racist conspiracy to say it's the Chinese virus when the Chinese created it in their Wuhan lab is turning out to be true. We were also right about vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>The same people who will freak out now if you donâ€™t wear a mask and stay 2 metres away from others are the same people who in January of last year were saying that trump was racist for closing the borders and were clapping like seals when palosi and Cosmo said to go to Chinatown and hug random chinaman and would tell anyone who listened how masks actually make the virus spread faster</p>

        <p>It's so true. if you google anything negative about masks- like even just people dealing with problems they cause- you come up with nothing. I've been kicked out of two other reddit groups, not for anything posted but simply because i'm a member and post in this group. Wow.</p>

<p>No they do not. These people would see 2+2=5 and not think twice to argue with you that "It can't equal 4, everything shows it as 5. 1 2 3 5... I don't know how hard that is for you to understand."</p>

        <p>'Safe' is an ethical term, not a scientific term. Promoting 'safety' is an act of ideological, not scientific justification and motivation. It is by definition a process of diminishing liberty - to promote any ideology such as 'safety'. The people you are talking about are not smart enough to begin to comprehend that they have been coopted into a global ideologically driven genocide.</p>
