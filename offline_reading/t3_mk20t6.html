    <strong>Why are young people getting vaccinated with little risk from covid and far more from the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Was on a zoom group, was horrified that two people in their 30s with excellent health got and were going to get the vaccine? WHY. One works in a solitary job, the other is a housewife. The risk factors don't even work out here. Just baffled.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of them are being pressured into it .. work, school, sports, family .. even teenagers.  It’s fucked up.  Heard a teenage boy riding his bike saying he got his first shot.  The indoctrination is not just for adults.</p>

        <p>People are superstitious about thier health and dont want to take personal responsibility. They’d rather follow the herd so they wont feel guilty even if the vaccine kills them. Also, generations have been playing it safe more and more as time goes by.</p>

        <p>To me one needn't necessarily research the matter to know that something doesn't smell quite right with this entire year long (plus) process.</p>
<p>Two weeks to (start) flatten(ing) the ~~curve~~ economy, curious nursing home mandates to take in cases, special apparent exemptions for ANTIFA while churches get busted; precautions and protocols oriented strictly to lock downs with nothing about safely going about life outside one's locked door.</p>
<p>Endless fear mongering scare tactics- inflated death counts; experts cry wolf... impending doom doom doom... Fauci says we should worry.  Frankly it insults my senses to where I can no longer watch or listen to newscasts for very long.</p>

        <p>Yeah the whole thing is suspicious and there is way too much contradictory news. Many lock down rules made no sense. Why didn't they pass out KN95s on every street corner. No one talks about cleaning doors, and things people touch, there's a lot of holes in the script so to speak. I have stopped watching news, and listening to the BS being shoveled. In my case I do believe a real virus some SARS2 has been released but they are lying about A LOT. They are claiming it's going up in my state now, don't even care. Same old same old.</p>

        <p>What the fuck is wrong with your head? They didn't pass out masks because they couldn't. There was a shortage across the world because the disease in the early stages was so infectious and was literally everywhere. And they have absolutely addressed your "WHy dONT THeY CleAn the DoOrknobs" point because they did and stressed you should. It just becomes a bit unmanageable when there are billions of people on the planet and many dont even give a fuck, i.e. the people on this sub. </p>

        <p>We still have people wearing the fucking gaiters, and bandanas a year later. Funny how they always have plenty of million dollar bombs and military equipment to blow up the latest Middle Eastern nation, but some simple PPE was so "HARD" and we have a sHorTaGE. Give me a break. Read my posts I was a Covid believer and supported all protoccols and the narrative until they wanted to force experimental vaccines on people and now children built on mRNA "operating systems". I even still wear the damn masks now due to being high risk, don't line up like a sheep.</p>

<p>The entire world was having a shortage. Congress begged trump to enact the defense production act to force companies to immediately switch production to these items but he didn't because he didn't acknowledge the pandemic for months.</p>

<p>I couldn't care less about how you feel or how you felt. I get it, you're a knuckle dragger that found somethings on the internet and now you're anti-vax. Don't care at all, not worth trying to convince you people of anything that you don't already want to believe. </p>
<p>I'm just here to disrupt the echo chamber of stupid ideas a little bit.</p>

        <p>Funny how you lump everyone in with antivaxxers when we don't want experimental vaccines but got every other safe vaccine, we were supposed to get. I'm not anti-vax, I'm anti-bullshit and being lied to and being a guinea pig. Doesn't it occur to you since I wear the masks, I believe Covid is real? Hope that didn't hurt your brain. :/</p>

        <p>So many people I know who already got the vaccine were really surprised to hear, that they’re part of a trial for experimental mRNA-‚vaccines‘. Most of them thought this was a ‘traditional’ vaccine as we had it for other diseases. They didn’t even do their homework before getting this stuff injected into their bodies..</p>

        <p>I would say that is the MAJORITY and from what I can tell 90 percent of them believe it has made them completely IMMUNE and where they cannot get Covid or pass it on. They believe it is the same. Most are mRNA what? They don't realize it is an experiment and don't realize there are risks. Informed consent in the true meaning is not happening. I was horrified the first DAY I went on to the pharmaceutical websites, I was a COVID true believer, leftist, in liberal circles, wore the masks, etc......</p>

        <p>In Canada the vaccine response has been a joke but I dread soon once they actually have the old people vaccinated the government will shift its focus to the young and began the campaign to pressure the youth to get it.

        <p>I’m 23 years old. Disagree with the lockdowns and the masks, but also will accept that covid is dangerous to some people in our society. Been going into work every day since this all started. I got the vaccine because I was eligible, I know it’s not going to kill me, and despite my disagreement with it I know the world will be moving towards vaccine passports in some form or another. Yea I hate it too. But I like to travel. I don’t buy into the conspiracy theories of chips or any other bullshit, and it’s not going to alter my dna, so why not do it and move on from the whole thing. Just my opinion.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently y’all didn’t actually want to know why someone from the younger generation got it? Just wanted to circle jerk around the idea that we’re stupid or something, I guess?</p>

        <p>I became disabled in my 20s, I don't like seeing people put their health at risk. I guess now you will find out if it does anything bad or not to you and I hope it does not. As for vaccine passports and the rest, is that the kind of future you want? When I was young, young people stood up a little bit, though I would say my own generation Gen X was far too apathetic. I didn't make my decision based on conspiracy, I went to go read the pharmaceutical websites FIRST and what they had to say about mRNA. I am horrified that young people are being told to play this experimental roulette wheel when these "vaccines" haven't even been vetted or proven not to have long term effects when Covid is such a small risk to you. Also it does not MAKE YOU IMMUNE OR PREVENT YOU FROM PASSING COVID TO someone else. So I ask what was the point? I know some young people are going to have parents and others influence them.</p>

<p>It’s been over 2 weeks since my second shot. Doing fine.</p>
<p>&rt;As for vaccine passports and the rest, is that the kind of future you want? </p>
<p>Did you actually read my comment?</p>
<p>&rt;When I was young, young people stood up a little bit, though I would say my own generation Gen X was far too apathetic. </p>
<p>You don’t know anything else about me. Who are you to judge?</p>
<p>&rt;I didn't make my decision based on conspiracy, I went to go read the pharmaceutical websites FIRST and what they had to say about mRNA. </p>
<p>Can you point me in the direction of some of this horrifying evidence/the dangers of mRNA?</p>
<p>&rt;I am horrified that young people are being told to play this experimental roulette wheel when these "vaccines" haven't even been vetted or proven not to have long term effects when Covid is such a small risk to you. Also it does not MAKE YOU IMMUNE OR PREVENT YOU FROM PASSING COVID TO someone else. </p>
<p>I agree on this to an extent, but like I said this vaccine isn’t going to kill me. You’re exaggerating. Kinda starting to sound like you’re drinking the kool-aid.</p>
<p>&rt;So I ask what was the point? I know some young people are going to have parents and others influence them.</p>
<p>Again, did you read my comment? I did what I did because whether you or I or anyone else likes it or not, vaccine passports will likely happen. Hard to fight for change if I’m locked inside my house while the rest of the world moves on.</p>

        <p>I mean maybe. Thats kinda the thing. Its a dice roll, and some people KNOW their body can't have a successful immune response. And they should either prepare to die or stay inside because you can't handle putting a piece of fabric on your face or getting a vaccine. Got it. Selfish child.</p>
<p>The majority of people realize how ridiculous you all are. We understand why you're this way to a degree because we all have a little bit of this fight in us. But in this instance its absolutely something to resent you for. You're stretching out difficult times over the most minor of inconveniences and its exhausting.</p>

        <p>Dude I had covid and I'm fine. I knew I'd be cause I've always been robust, but because I'm fat I was concerned. Aaron Paige is a world class strongman and died in a couple of days at like 32. I was aching all over my body, exhausted every day, couldn't smell anything, was coughing and had a consistent headache for two weeks. Afterwards I found that my endurance had gone down in my weight training and even disc golfing 18 rounds had me WAY more tired than I've ever been. Now I'm closer to "normal" in terms of training but I am CONSTANTLY hacking up phlegm. I have no idea the damage its done to me internally (because that's what covid does, it constricts your blood vessels causing them to suffocate and die).</p>
<p>Just because you don't understand what something is doesn't mean it isn't dangerous. And just because you haven't suffered from it yet doesn't mean that you won't. I am considerably more lucky than many.</p>
