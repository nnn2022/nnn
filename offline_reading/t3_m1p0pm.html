        <p>There's a reason they haven't been pushing antibody tests. The more people that find out they already had it and were asymptomatic, the harder it is to scare people.</p>

        <p>A couple of months ago, there was a theory being floated that previously infected people might not need both doses of the two-part vaccines, and that might help get more people fully protected faster. All it would take is a test for antibodies before getting the first shot.</p>
<p>Since that would just throw a hurdle into "getting shots into arms," the health authorities decided it wasn't worth looking into. I remember saying that it would end the panic within weeks. People who thought they'd done such a great job of following the rules and avoiding infection, instead found they'd been infected months ago and never even knew.</p>
