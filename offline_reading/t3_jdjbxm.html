    <strong>I have heard a little about how Agenda 21 and the Great Reset are real possibilities as part of this corona mess.</strong>
    <p><p>However, I am curious if anyone has any solid ideas about how the agendas could be only conceptual, and why likely couldn’t actually be carried out.</p></p>

        <p>They aren't just possibilities, they are happening. The websites of governments, the UN and various other NGOs specifically discuss Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, and the "Great Reset". It's straight out of their own mouths.</p>
<p>As a wise man once said "If someone tells me he wants to kill me, I tend to assume he is serious".</p>
<p>The sequence of events since at least the 90's make it obvious it's real - like the little flowchart I've made below, with assorted goalposts of brainwashing and increased government power:</p>
<p>"Global Warming" panic -----&rt; 9/11 "Security Theatre" ----&rt; Obsessions with "Urban Density" and "Sustainable Development" ----&rt; Greta and the "Climate Change" cult ----&rt; Coronavirus "Bio-Security Theatre" ----&rt; Restrictions and Lockdowns ----&rt; Marriage of Climate and Corona panic cults ----&rt; Global government and tyranny</p>
<p>I beg you - read up on this, and get informed. The information is out there for all to see; far too many believe the narrative fed to them over what their own eyes and their gut instincts are telling them.</p>

        <p>I’m not a full-on doubter, but I know that not everyone believes this can happen and I’m curious how they explain that. </p>
<p>Also, no plans are ever 100%. Maybe there are ways the plans could fail. I’m interested in these two possibilities.</p>

        <p>Those who don't believe this can happen are those <em>who simply don't want to believe it can happen.</em> It is human nature to try and wish away unpleasant things - especially when they are so potentially life-changing and on such a massive scale. </p>
<p>If the 300 pound gorilla in the room is hiding behind a curtain, I can simply say: "I don't see the gorilla, so he doesn't really exist".</p>
<p>As for the agenda failing - there are only two ways to prevent it - the ballot box, or the ammo box. I'm not confident there is enough will or critical thinking skills in our present population for either to happen.</p>

        <p>Why is it that you believe your sources of information are infallible? Just claiming anything that doesn’t confirm what you have chosen to believe is a lie isn’t critical thinking. </p>
<p>You’re gorilla analogy implies a lack of critical thinking. Since claiming it doesn’t exist won’t stop it from coming out from behind the curtain and tearing your face off.</p>
<p>It’s more like you’re telling someone there is a gorilla behind the curtain and you’ll create any kind of evidence and link any kind of information together in order to prove you’re right. And if they look and find there is no gorilla, you’ll make up more stories in order to prove that you were not wrong, and blame the other person for misinterpreting what you said. </p>
<p>How is what you are doing any different from members of different religious sects claiming that only they have the real information. Only your source is true. And anyone else who believes otherwise is a mindless sheep. If someone else’s critical thinking doesn’t lead them to the exact same spot as you, they just don’t get it!</p>
<p>How do nations that are not facing COVID restrictions and are going about life with little to no changes (I.e. New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam), fit into the narrative you have sold yourself?</p>

        <p>If you live in a city in the west: Just Google [name of your city] + Agenda 21 and you will very likely find official documents or websites describing how Agenda 21 has been already actively implemented in managing countless aspects of your city for years. I live in a small German city and found documents from the 1990s. This is not something that is just getting started because of corona. Corona will accelerate this long perexsisting plan to incredible heights though.</p>

        <p>Yeah I do know it goes back to the 90s. 
I understand it’s probably a reality</p>

        <p>&rt; EDIT: Why am I getting the opposite of what I asked for ?</p>
<p>because agenda 21 and it's current phase agenda 2030 <em>ARE</em> actually being carried out</p>
<p>&rt; I know where to go to do more research on why it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>then why are you here asking inane questions?</p>

<p>you are talking in circles</p>
<p>the core readers here are realists for the most part. </p>
<p>they obviously reject the 'new not normal' and are aware of the both a21 and TGR that are being foisted on us with the bogus ass covid as pretext for the latter.</p>
