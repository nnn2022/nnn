    <strong>Saying you're selfish for not taking the vaccine would be like saying you're selfish for not going to war and fighting for your country</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Both war and Covid has caused a lot of damage to the world.</p>
<p>Those who go to war don't know what will happen to them. For all they know, they could be killed by an opposing soldier tomorrow. Likewise, those that take the vaccine could be killed tomorrow from it's poison or whatever.</p>
<p>Those that partake in either could save their people, but it comes with a lot of risks that only the most selfless of people would do.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all under the assumption that the vaccine blocks transmission, which it DOESN'T. I've stressed this a lot lately. But if it actually did, then saying you're selfish for not taking the vaccine would be like saying you're selfish for not going to war and fighting for your country.</p>
<p>Not selfless doesn't necessarily mean selfish.</p></p>

        <p>No one has a moral obligation to be a lab rat.  And to encourage participation in mass experimentation is even worse. </p>
<p>If 70% of the women who took the vaccine become  infertile, will it still be worth it?!?</p>

        <p>That's a good observation. I never once saw these hardcore pro-vaxxers feeling empathic for those that experience horrific effects from the vaccines. Instead, they are always like "take the vaccine, or you are a horrible, selfish person."</p>
<p>These people are such NPCs. If anything, they are the selfish ones.</p>

        <p>They are selfish. No one will be around when you get injured or die. You suffer your injuries, day in day out. They just keep repeating like idiots, get the shot, get the shot. I think that those people who were forced or pressured through to get the death shots and if they were injured or die, they or their family should go after the people that did that to them. Those people should feel the repercussions of their actions. You injure or kill someone because you force a medical procedure on them, you pay. Let’s see how many will continue to say, mandate death shots, unvaccinated should feel the wrath or be forced to live like a 2nd class citizen. </p>
<p>See, you can’t go murdering or injuring people and walk away Scott free.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Since the vaccine companies and pharmacists aren't liable for any vaccine injuries or death, they are basically getting away with maiming and murdering people scot-free.</p>

It was organized by prominent suffragettes of the time as a propaganda device aimed at men who didn’t participate in the war.</a></p>

Aside from being absent of emotional understanding, the campaign lacked research. This meant that women were handing the flowers to more or less any man whom they found on the street instead of on the front.</a></p>

It frustrated young boys who wanted to prove their masculinity, it offended men who tried to enlist but were turned down as unfit, and it was simply rude and ungrateful to hand a white feather to veterans.</a></p>

        <p>That is exactly what they did in the world wars. If the white feather brigade saw you they would hand you a white feather. That white feather was very derogatory and symbolic of cowardice and not being a real man. It didn't matter if you were ineligible for combat or a wounded soldier who returned home or in a profession that couldn't go over like a teacher.</p>
