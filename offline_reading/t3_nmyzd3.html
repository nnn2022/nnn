    <strong>Can those vaccinated give the virus to unvaccinated people?</strong>
    <p><p>So my in laws all got vaccinated and they live with us. Me, my wife, and son are all now sick. Very mild symptoms, just congestion, headache, diarrhea (tmi I know), and overall sluggishness; no fevers, and my baby boy literally just had a stuffed up nose. Im wondering if we could have been infected with something from my in laws being vaccinated. I’m curious if anyone has any studies or information showing this possibility in clinical studies or trials.</p></p>

        <p>Vaccinated people can get the virus, and get sick from it. They can also transmit the virus to other people, including other vaccinated people.</p>
<p>The COVID vaccines are meaningless junk that provides exactly zero protection from COVID.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It was only approved by the FDA and similar international agencies because they because felt they had to do something about COVID, with what a worldwide hoopla it was causing. </p>
<p>Suggesting that the pandemic would eventually end through herd immunity via infection was not an option.</p>

        <p>Correction, at this point in time, none of the mRNA vaccines are FDA "Approved". They are Authorized for emergency usage.</p>

        <p>Yeah its why i initially didnt take the jab, no reward only risk</p>
<p>Doesnt prevent you from getting or spreading it, just makes the symptoms less extreme. So whats the point?</p>
<p>Not to mention the makers arent liable for any damages which is a huge red flag for anything. I sell you a watch but im not liable if it explodes in your face. Would you buy it?</p>

        <p>Yep, all those peer-reviewed studies of millions of vaccinated people all over the world that show how few of them became infected, how few of them were hospitalized, and how few of them died are all just a giant conspiracy.</p>

        <p>All I need to see is that the US, with one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, is doing no better with COVID than these European countries that have barely vaccinated their elderly.</p>

        <p>Of course medical studies are going to lie about how effective the vaccines are.</p>
<p>If the vaccines worked in the least, the US should probably be no higher than 50 COVID deaths a day right now. Not almost 700.</p>

        <p>Guessing you've never been through the peer-review process, as someone who has I can tell you lying doesn't work out well.</p>
<p>The vaccines clearly work as we have had a large and statistically significant drop in daily cases and deaths since vaccination began - anyone who can read a simple trend line chart can <strong>see</strong> that.</p>

        <p>If people have taken a vaccine and are still catching the virus and spreading it to others, nobody is vaccinated in that scenario.</p>
<p>Up until the last year or so, "vaccinated" was all but synonymous with "immune". Newspeak has changed that, but the fact remains, there's little point in a healthy person taking the vaccine when it doesn't actually do what vaccines have always been understood to do.</p>

        <p>There's some good info in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmfvpe/i_think_the_shot_causes_people_to_shed_something/"><strong>this post</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Ryan's video about <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>Self-Spreading Vaccines, Self-Amplifying MRNA Vaccines &amp; COVID Vaccine Menstrual Disruption</strong></a> was one of his best works (and he always cites his sources near the bottom of the page). </p>
<p>And <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/"><strong>here's a good article</strong></a> that talks about shedding. </p>
<p>Also, listen to what former Pfizer scientist Michael Yeadon had to say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nlphfh/michael_yeadon_full_interview/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>about this scamdemic</strong></a>. Or you can just check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nl72px/chief_scientist_of_pfizer_mike_yeadon_it_is_now/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>this out</strong></a> to read. </p>
<p>I'll share a short story with you: I met two relatives who got the AZ shot (they only got the first dose, haven't got the 2nd one yet). After meeting them I came down with a sore throat, and a slight fever. My mum came down with stomach cramps (no menstrual bleeding but she felt cramps/pain in that region). After several days we both got better. Neither my mum or myself are vaxxed, nor plan to get vaxxed. I am worried if something was passed onto me, but so far I feel fine (this was over 30 days ago). But because of what happened I started looking into viral shedding. I am a bit scared about it because what if those behind this scamdemic (aka The New World Order or NWO) had pre-planned this whereby they knew many of us wouldn't take it, but would count on the brainwashed ones to take the shot, and thus become walking/talking sources of contagion? Like, they can roam about everywhere and make everyone sick, so this is a big concern of mine.</p>

        <p>Thank you, sorry I wasn't much help, and I hope I didn't scare you further. Sorry, I just wanted to share my experience and some links. I can definitely say I'm physically in tiptop shape, very very healthy, no medical issues, no body pain or aches, every bodily function works, and so I'm glad it was just a fever and sore throat that I had. Yes, I am worried something is still in me, but I pray every morning and at night before going to bed for protection and blessings. That's all I can do right now, aside from eating healthily and avoiding those who've been vaxxed. Good luck my friend, and be ready for the NWO's next set of diabolical plans.

I do worry for my wife and child, but they’ll be alright. I hope I’m wrong about this feeling of evil being unraveled in the world, and that I really am just crazy but we shall see.
