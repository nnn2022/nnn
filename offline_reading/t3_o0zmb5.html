        <p>While this is funny, doomers actually respond with "but covid is way worse than the flu which is why masking killed the flu but not enough masking to kill covid." So you simply respond with the fact that if the flu was so ridiculously easy to defeat, and the flu kills tens of thousands of people a year every year in America alone, why weren't we taking these steps to stop the flu and save untold lives? Then end with the statement that this means the CDC have allowed all those flu deaths to occur because they are incompetent or they are mass murderers by knowingly doing nothing. Checkmate.</p>

        <p>Don't think that I'm defending the fools who believe in this shit, but this is an argument flaw and we skeptics are better off for not arguing improperly. I'll play Devil's Advocate here: It's possible that the amount of mask wearing was enough to stop the flu from spreading as it normally would have and that the amount of mask wearing was not enough to mitigate COVID . From an argumentative perspective, they are two different viruses with similar but not exactly the same method of transmission.</p>
<p>I know memes are convenient and sometimes funny, but if we are to maintain our bodily autonomy in the face of tyranny, we must argue thoroughly and properly.</p>

        <p>Both viruses are smaller than what a mask can protect, so a mask is basically useless.</p>

        <p>Well I for one will not let the lack of data get in the way of conjecture. Its been the fucking mantra the whole time. Masks work because they <em>"obviously"</em> do. No actual qualitative data proves they work. Just some bullshit infographic about people pissing on eachother. </p>
<p>It is a valid observation to point out that,  even with less than optimal NPI adherence we essentially eradicated a disease that has been endemic for decades. </p>
<p>If the NPIs were ineffective against covid and we actually believe asymptomatic spread is a significant transmission vector. It would stand to reason that a very significant amount of people have already been infected and the pandemic is over. Now its just going to be endemic for a few decades. We <em>never</em> needed herd immunity. We just needed to beef up the hospital system and keep going. </p>
<p>We didn't fucking beat this virus with masks and a vaccine. The people who claim this sound as stupid as suggesting using a nuke to stop a hurricane.</p>
<p>Regardless if the virus is natural or a man made bio weapon. As soon as significant human to human transmission took place it became a force of nature. </p>
<p>Its silly to think we could control it.</p>
