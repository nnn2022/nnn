        <p>It's not 'just' anyone, it's medical professionals and scientists. Censorship is probably the biggest reason for my anger right now. And it involves the entire scope of the situation, not just the lockdowns. </p>

        <p>He raises the interesting question of whether lockdowns would be justified if covid was deadly to children. For the sub, if covid did kill children at a high rate, would you support the lockdown measures?</p>
<p>Are you for freedom as an absolute, or do you instead feel that the measures aren't justified in this case because the virus isn't deadly enough? My view is that there are cases where a measure that restricts freedom is justified, but only in the extreme case where the ability of the society to exist is threatened.</p>
<p>So conscription of people into the military is justified in cases where there's an imminent threat of invasion - you can say you have a constitutional right not to be in the military but if most people say that and Hitler invades, he won't be respecting your constitutional rights. Likewise, if there was a disease as deadly as the Black Death it would kill so many people if it spread unchecked that food distribution and essential utilities would no longer function. You couldn't live at all under such circumstances.</p>
<p>So I would say lockdown measures are justified if the virus was deadly enough, but it in no way threatens the existence of society. At most it means a shortage of intensive care beds and doctors to treat patients, which is far from civilization-destroying.</p>

        <p>I don't think mandatory lockdown is justifiable under any circumstances. If it was killing children, then keep your kids at home and do your best to keep them safe. Provide as much state assistance as possible to achieve that aim. Let everything else continue and let people make their own choices. Lockdowns don't work anyway, they just make the problem worse. There is only so much control you can exert over a force of nature.</p>
<p>I don't believe conscription is justifiable either. In both world wars, the majority of men that signed up did so not just voluntarily, but eagerly. In the face of a real existential threat, which is the only time you should be going to war anyway, the majority of people will step up to fight without being forced. Trust people to do the right thing, we are a society after all, if you have to be forced to fight to defend that society, I'd argue it isn't worth saving in the first place.</p>

        <p>If it was that deadly and contagious, none of this medieval quackery would do a thing to stop or slow it. Instead, there would just be a total societal collapse as millions of workers die and the rest flee the cities. They are able to LARP an apocalyptic plague with covid-1984 and act like they are controlling the virus with all their dystopian measures precisely because it is such a mild and low IFR virus.</p>
<p>If you had something that was as contagious as covid, but as deadly as ebola (bioweapon scenario, since such viruses don't exist in nature), then society would have collapsed within weeks and the governments would basically cease to exist...not become more powerful than ever.</p>
<p>This whole covid psyop is very effective precisely because the powers that be know that this isn't a deadly plague at all. They know it's a new strain of a coronavirus cold but they also know how easy it is to brainwash a gullible and ignorant public that watches to much Hollywood shit and idiotically believes that "science" and government can save them from a deadly plague.</p>
<p>All you have to do is tell them a 0.2% IFR virus that only kills the most frail and elderly is a once-in-a-millennium pandemic. Then quickly dismiss and silence any opposition from scientists while anointing your own specific set of quacks to fearmonger to the masses how horrible the virus is. 24/7 media coverage of blatant lies and disinformation, social media spreading the bullshit constantly, and scapegoating anyone who doesn't mindlessly accept the narrative as to why the virus still exists. That's the formula for pulling this off and getting hundreds of millions to accept it, love it, and ask for more.</p>

        <p>20% means its truly new, similar to the diseases Europeans introduced to native Americans.</p>
<p>Not even the 1918 Flu killed that much. We should be marvelling at the efficiency of our immune system and how it keeps us alive from so many micro predators. And a proper health system would be promoting at strengthening it. Stop pandering to obese people and others that are endangering themselves.</p>

        <p>1918 flu only killed as many as it did due to the hygiene and conditions of the time period and no antibiotics. The IFR was something like 2%. Most that died did so of secondary bacterial pneumonia. If it had happened later it would have had a much lower IFR.</p>

        <p>on the upside, it might get you quite famous and fire back in some way.</p>
<p>although having your name turned into a verb may not be the famous someone would be looking for :D</p>
<p>"wakefielded" is the term used by some. example sentence:</p>
<p>"i know, that  vaccines are harming and even killing our children, but i can't speak up as a doctor or scientist, or i might get wakefielded."</p>
<p>wakefielded refering to the destruction of one's professional career and also  a huge propaganda campaign based on lies in the media, as this happened to dr. andrew wakefield.</p>
<p>for those curious, that is a nice 30 minute documentary  going over the wakefield case:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo</a> </p>
<p>what came out of this war against this person however is a person free of  those chains of shutting up, who is aware of the attacks, that will get thrown against people and who researched the harms of vaccines and  did tons of work to bring awareness about the harm to people.</p>
<p>he was one of the people behind the documentary:</p>
<p>"Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe", which was an unbelievable success, partially due to the censorship, that hit the documentary actually.</p>
<p>and he is also behind a new documentary:</p>
<p>"1986: the act" this is refering to the  National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, that removed all liability from vaccine manufacturers:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5546/summary/36">https://www.congress.gov/bill/99th-congress/house-bill/5546/summary/36</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Provides that no vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death: (1) resulting from unavoidable side effects; or (2) solely due to the manufacturer's failure to provide direct warnings. </p>
<p>and thus opened the ground for the insane vaccine flood, that happened since without any proper testing done on them of course.</p>
<p>point being, that the desired destruction of a person resulted in that person having a MUCH MUCH bigger influence on people  as he would have ever had otherwise.</p>
<p>those documentaries and his other work going far beyond what a few case series or peer reviewed studies do in waking the people up.</p>
<p>so yes the  war against anyone questioning the mainstream controlled narative is horrible, but we shouldn't fear  what happens as we speak up, because that is the only way to change things and it can also have wonderful longterm consequences, like for dr. andrew wakefield :)</p>
