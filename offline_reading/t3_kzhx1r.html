    <strong>Who here got Covid19 ?</strong>
    <p><p>I am just curious to know if you or someone you know got tested positive and what was your overall experience. What were your symptoms or lack off ? How long did it last ? When did all of it dissapeared ? </p>
<p>I got tested positive last year and i must admit that for 2 weeks i was literally on my ass. It was exactly like the flu and sinus infections but 100X worst. I get the flu every year but that time was different which is why i believe in the virus (regardless of the plan and all the other topics that we all discuss here). I had high fever,stuffy nose,i couldn't smell or taste anything,short breath but the most suprising symptom was the intense fatigue. That was something that lasted for a whole month but after that everything came back to normal and i am perfectly healthy again. I am a "builded on a cat frame" woman in her thirties and healthy in advance so that was my best defense obviously.</p>
<p>My husband and kids got it too and for them it was just like the regular flu,not worst nor better. They were fine after a week and we all respected the mandatory quarantine and a year ago we were on the doomers side so...</p>
<p>Besides that,nobody that we know got tested positive.</p>
<p>I work in health care,in a hospital and my family's experience seem to be the norm. The only patients with problems have comorbidities. Such as obesity,addictions (mostly smoking,alcohol),old age,cancer,diabetes and other immunocompromised patients. 2% of patients died and 95% were in these categories and often in more than one.</p>
<p>So i am curious to know about all of you !</p></p>

        <p>I know 2 people (out of 500+ friends on Facebook) who were hospitalized because of high fevers. Just 2 out of hundreds. They both recovered and are fine. The other people I know who tested positive had no symptoms, or what seemed like a regular cold</p>

        <p>Quebec City here.  I know 6 people and a family of 4 who tested positive.  2 people had a loss of taste/smell for a few weeks and the rest were completely asymptomatic.  The family of 4 included a woman of 82 years of age that was never tested and asymptomatic despite living with 4 positive family members.</p>
<p>I took a deep dive into the vitamin D research and recommended everyone I know to take at least 3000 IU vitamin D daily. Since taking vitamin D, I have not experienced a cold or flu for 5 years where I would previously get sick at least twice a year.</p>
<p>The good news is Ivermectin is about to hit the scene which will help protect those most at risk.</p>

        <p>Good job on the vitamin D ! It is crucial for the immune system.</p>
<p>Since you are from Québec,you probably already know that they stopped giving vitamin d and other supplements to our elderly in chsld and rpas ? </p>
<p>I wonder if there's a link between all that and the last years narrative of staying away from the sun as much as possible and using very high dosage of sunblock ?</p>

        <p>Since I became a farmer, I never got sick. I used to catch a cold 2 times a year on average. Not anymore, probably due to the sun exposure </p>
<p>Vitamin D works very well</p>

        <p>Me, my family, most of my friends. Last time we discussed with my friends, it came out 9 out of 11 had it alongside their families.  And many more people I know personally. Some say it was terrible, others like me are not so impressed. Better to be one week with a fever than one year in lockdown misery.</p>

        <p>Unconfirmed but anyway,</p>
<p>I went to the doctor just before this whole thing kicked off, around the time it was coming to Italy first (I live in Europe), felt like absolute shit, like the flu but worse. I only went to the doctor because I wanted a sick note to stay off work, wasn't actually that bad </p>
<p>The doctor was pretty relaxed and chill 
Anyway, doctor joked and asked had I been to Italy or Wuhan, laughed and said no. He examined me anyway, came back and told me I had some "weird virus" and who knows what it is and to go home and rest</p>
<p>Went home, got into bed for 2 days, felt horrible, no energy, couldn't move, dizzy, hard to breathe. After 2 days I came around, still felt a bit stiff and groggy but fine other than that</p>

        <p>Around 8 cases in the family. Worst was woman in her 30s, healthy, in hospital on the ventilator. Another had oxygen at home for few days. Couple others were bedridden for a week. I was suspected as having. My worst symptoms were no taste n smell for 12 days. My Mrs has had ongoing taste n smell issues since March 2020. We both didn't test until much later. Hers was negative. My sample was unreadable.</p>

        <p>Neither I nor my husband have had it. My cousin (a surgical resident) caught it from a patient in July. He was mildly sick, like with a cold, for about 3 days and tired for about a week. He was normal a week before his quarantine ended. He did lose his sense of smell / taste, and he says it's still screwy.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law and father-in-law caught it when he was in the hospital for back surgery. They were both mildly sick for 3 days, and extremely tired for about a week. No other issues. My brother-in-law caught it, and was sick and terribly miserable for over 2 weeks (fainted in his hallway trying to get back from the bathroom once). He has asthma but is otherwise healthy (no drinking, slim and exercises regularly). He's fine now. They think he caught it from his teenager daughter but, if so, she was asymptomatic (never tested).</p>

        <p>My whole family (31,33,9,6) and I(32m) all got it except my fiance and I's two year old. Lost my sense of taste and smell for a month and for a couple days had some sniffles. That was it. Didn't need a swab buried in my brain to tell me I had it.. one of the people in my house had it worse and got tested positive . He had a 104.8 degree fever and aches and really tired for a couple days. Then was nearly perfect again..  this shit is not that big of a deal. It's literally the flu but not seasonal.</p>

        <p>Who would I know if I have had covid ? </p>
<p>In all seriousness. Covid has not been isolated so how can you test for it. How can you say for sure that it wasn’t the standard flu. </p>
<p>How can you trust the PCR equipment. When the inventor said it should not be used to test for viruses. </p>
<p>How the fuck does anyone know they had covid?</p>

        <p>As far as I know I have not had it. My child tested positive a couple weeks ago. He complained of a headache and he had a very low fever. I used no extra precautions. I did not mask him or ban him to his room. I didn't disinfect anything. His symptoms got less until they were completely gone 48 hours later. </p>
<p>My friend with extremely bad asthma got it this past fall. He's around 50, slightly overweight from asthma meds (steroids), and also has elevated blood pressure. He felt tired for a week and has some lingering fatigue. </p>
<p>My coworker's family got it in the beginning, well her and her husband and half of the kids. Totally fine in a week. </p>
<p>A friend's kids got it over the summer, but she didn't. She banned them to their rooms and cleaned like a crazy person. They all recovered easily. </p>
<p>I don't know anyone that has died or been hospitalized.</p>

        <p>Not me or my household, but my 66 year old mom and my 83 year old step dad both got it just before Christmas.  They addressed it quickly, and just felt crummy for 5-6 days.  They are both reasonably healthy for their age, tho he has some very minor issues with blood sugar, normally.  None of that seemed to increase the threat they had from contracting COVId.</p>

        <p>It lasted a little over a week for my wife and I but your description is bang on.  I’m 59, generally pretty healthy. For a couple of days we just stayed in bed until 3pm.  No lingering effects since.</p>

        <p>It can apparantly be a very rare symptom actually but it is true that we have seen this more in children. </p>
<p>I remember an obese man in particular who had pretty severe diarrhea,to the point of dehydration. Poor man was so anxious and scared because he tested positive and he had comorbities,he took the result as a death sentence literally. Medias are scaring people to that point. Fortunately he made it very well !</p>
