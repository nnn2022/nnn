    <strong>Upstream from obedient</strong>
    <p><p>I felt compelled to write a quick note in here saying how much I appreciate everyone in this sub.  99% of reddit is pro lock down and majority are on board with govt removing more rights from the people, but here i feel the people with common sense flock.  I love when I see someone shit talk this sub, get 15 down votes, then delete their post because they're worried about fake Karma points and what it will do to their profile.  Amazing how fast they retreat when they realize they don't have answers for the questions or comments we make.  You guys keep kicking ass, and ill keep lurking and throwing in downvotes for the supporters of the 14 day curve 11 months later.</p></p>

        <p>Right back at you friend, I really am feeling the love and positivity in here lately. Perhaps the 1 year mark on the pandemic restrictions coming up is causing a great awakening but I think many of us are sick and tired of society not weighing all the pros and cons equally in their reaction.</p>
<p>I believe the facts and the science are now completely in our favor. Tides are a turning.</p>

        <p>Some areas are very much pro-lockdown. In Washington where I live about half of the people I see are double masked. It's very rare to see people without masks on even outside.</p>

        <p>Washington is the epicenter of the jewish-american ruling class. It only makes sense that the propaganda is the strongest there.</p>

        <p>Their fear and ignorance and pride drive their decisions. If we remain respectful and share evidence and truth with logic and reason we can potentially influence more people to question their reality. I think people do want to believe humanity is not a virus. They just can't reconcile new and old information within their current experience. We have to keep asking the right questions and sharing the sound data. Pointing out fallacy and pseudoscience.  Glad you came here. Speak out to as many as you can about what you think and how you feel. You never know who may be receptive.</p>

        <p>Always have to take baby steps with the doomers. I like to start with a general non-politicized idea like "do you think people make good decisions when they are scared?" Then follow up with "so why then is your government and media trying to terrify it's people on a daily basis?"</p>
<p>Just little reality checks once in a while. People hate admitting they've been fooled or mislead, so just give them something to think about and don't expect an apology unless it's truly a humble individual.</p>

        <p>Exactly. it's embarrassing to our egos to admit we're wrong. Hubris is strong.  Humility is a noble and narrow path. And there is no point in speaking to someone who speaks ill about or against you. Their minds are not for the making or changing. They are too far gone. We have to focus on the ones who know in their hearts something is off, they just don't understand why. Just like how we were when we started to ask questions and seek truth. These are the ones who can also activate change in thinking of others.</p>
