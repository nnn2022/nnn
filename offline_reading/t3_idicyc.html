    <strong>So me and my Mom had a huge discussion</strong>
    <p><p>She said that Masks will perhaps soon be mandatory, at my school and in general and i said Well if thats the case, then i won’t wear a mask, and she said Well then you’ll get fines and perhaps not be able to go to school.  I simply said yeah well then i won’t go to School.   </p>
<p>She has said that she won’t get the Covid-app or take the vaccine.  Which is a good thing </p>
<p>But she totally downplayed the effects complying with these rules has on my future.  Like the Economy falling apart,  school and education going down the drain.  And when i mentioned the fact that we have not even been given evidence of Masks, Social Distancing and Lockdowns working, she simply said that is just because there is so much we don’t know.  Then i said if we don’t know if the rules even work, then complying with the rules are even more pointless if we do not even know the effectiveness of these Draconian rules. <br>
She was also down playing the treats of tyranical goverment.  I said tyranical goverment has always killed alot of people all throughout human history.  And a virus or a disease are only a Spike for a certain period of time, then it fades as the population gets immune to the disease  </p>
<p>I got very mad,  because my own mother has atleast in some sense became a treat to my rights!</p></p>

<p>They don't know indeed, but they also don't care because, all they want is people to have blind faith and believe a dogma. And when people's health is damaged by this dogma, they can't restore it.</p>

<p>Hey, at least your mom acknowledged that it was a possibility.</p>
<p>When I called all this police state bullshit exactly what it was and asked her if she'd be fine with doing this every single time some "new" virus was discovered, my ma literally said it was worth living in one so the government can "keep us safe."</p>

        <p>Based on your grammar alone, you need that education. Based on the content of your post and your grammar, you REALLY need that education. #1 If you do not believe masks and social distancing mitigate the spread of covid-19, that's just your opinion, and your opinion is far from fact. #2 Good luck making good friends in college. The only people disregarding college-wide rules are the few selfish assholes.</p>
<p>You said "she totally downplayed the effects complying with these rules has on my future." I can guarantee, if no one had worn masks or social distanced during this pandemic, the "effects" on your future would be far, far, more negative. Also, what impact does wearing a simple piece of cloth over your face have on your future?</p>
<p>\&rt; we have not even been given evidence of Masks, Social Distancing and Lockdowns working,</p>
<p>There is far, far, more evidence that face covering, social distancing, and lockdowns (extreme social distancing) works. 99% of the primary articles I've read support face coverings and social distancing as an effective method of preventing the spread of Covid-19. I would be very, very, surprised if you were able to even provide five peer-reviewed primary papers from reputable journal, disproving the effectiveness of masks or social distancing.</p>
<p>As someone who just graduated with a BA in Biology, its honestly hilarious that there are people out there who doubt the efficacy of masks and social distancing, since its LITERALLY common sense. If you lack the common sense to realize that masks and social distancing work, I highly doubt you have the capacity to properly interpret the results of a primary paper. My suggestion is to go to college, follow their rules, and work on those critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Also, I'd love those sources if you have the time</p>
