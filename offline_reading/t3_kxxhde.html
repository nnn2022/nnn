    <strong>Anybody from Massachusetts</strong>
    <p><p>Is anybody here from the state of Massachusetts? I have been thinking about coming up with a way to get involved with this lockdown stuff and reaching out to our state reps with questions. It would be things like how long do they expect for this to go on and if they have been looking at any recent data that has been coming out of this pandemic that justifies further restrictions and mandates. They have recently required all students going to school, including college students up to the age of 30 to get the flu vaccine before they can return to school as a result. My concern is that if we don't get involved locally, the madness will continue.</p></p>

        <p>I saw your post a while ago and meant to respond. I’m in mass. I’ve been feeling like I need to take action as well and we both share the idea it needs to start locally. I think we would want to ask more specific and precise questions. For example: “you have kept us in lockdown and formed policy based around the statement of believing in science. We demand that you show us specific scientific data that supports these statements.” Specifically peer reviewed scientific studies, with proper control groups etc. </p>
<p>Things like demanding information on cycle threshold limits from labs over the last year. Mask studies, t-cell immunity information, amount of people actually studied to get the 95% efficacy rates. Things like that, but demand the actual literature they are forming policy off of.</p>
