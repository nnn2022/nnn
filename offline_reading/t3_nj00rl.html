        <p>I know people hate Californians but I honestly really want to move to another state like Texas because california sucks right now. The only reason I’m not fully supportive in going is because I have friends who I may lose because I’m not getting the vaccine</p>

        <p>The thing is, no matter where Californians go, if you want to leave your state, please leave your states politics behind. The only reason Californians get such bad rep, is because they say it sucks, so they go somewhere else, and then way too loudly try to turn whatever state they ended up in into California. Don't do that, and as a Texan, you're good.</p>

        <p>This might be a small factor, but Californians migrating is not the root cause of states flipping. It's immigration by and large causing states to flip. Immigrants will overwhelmingly vote and agree with taking away American values like the 1st or 2nd amendment. If you can find them look up what American elections would look like if only certain groups voted, it's eye opening</p>

        <p>Only U.S. citizens can vote in US elections. Saying immigrants are voting is false. It also takes years for immigration to lead to citizenship. </p>
<p>How long does one need to be a citizen to not be considered an immigrant?</p>
<p>Children of immigrants born here are citizens too who are eligible to vote at 18. Unless you're considering those folks to be immigrants to. </p>

        <p>I'm a Californian who will most likely make the exodus soon like so many (don't worry, I'm not a dick who will end up voting like I never left Comifornia), but I've found people are leaving due to different things but mainly financial. Your money doesn't go far here. I earn a decent living, but as a single person all I can afford is a shitty condo in an undesirable neighborhood. True I could live in it for years and then get some money back, but I'd rather not go through years of that. Other reasons people leave? The homeless have taken over and when the city does try (poorly...) to intervene,  there's locals (ie young, white Bernie fans...) who get pissed about it. The city is putting homeless shelters now in suburban residential areas where the majority of people are home owners and (NIMBY) despite people getting together to work against it, lose. My neighborhood added a trolley stop and with that came the homeless and then eventually a shelter (that they are trying to expand....)  . You will see tents and all their filth throughout the area. Where I once would ride my bike, has been blocked and taken over. The park where families used to go to now has tables with a bunch of them looting. Despite all the mental health and substance abuse outreach, they have free will so continue to live this way. </p>
<p>That said I cannot say that this is all over CA rather in the cities (including suburbs near the city), it's a growing problem. Many bedroom communities have also have become barrios (not mine however the ones near me are). Making weed legal (I fucked up voted to make it legal here) here also has made my neighborhood become  a hang out for people who sit in their cars, getting high due to the dispensaries and increase in smoke and accessory shops everywhere. You see them loiter all the time at night. In the morning, they leave presents in the community of the silver canisters from inhaling. the empty green weed containers, beer bottles, and a bunch of fast food trash. Myself and others in the neighborhood now weekly clean up after them. If you want to smoke weed, fine but don't pull this shit and loiter in neighborhoods. </p>
<p>I can keep going on and on. Honestly though, what I would miss about CA is really just the weather and the close proximity to the water. I'm realizing though it's not enough to sacrifice everything else  for it.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be no understanding of cause and effect, so they're not even aware they're creating the issues. They're not voting for massive inflation and shutting businesses down, just raising the minimum wage.</p>

People from California have done that to my home town in Oregon, and I know how much animosity it can produce. Finding housing is nearly impossible where I live. </p>

        <p>It’s like the idea of hearing about aircraft accidents. </p>
<p>You only hear about the ones that crash. Imagine if you heard about the ones that successfully land. </p>
<p>People don’t put that into perspective. It’s almost like the media has an effect which makes people focus on one element 🤔</p>

        <p>There is a reason Florida, Texas and other states are doing so well - the vulnerable elderly in those state received two jabs in the initial vaccine rollout, not one.  Canada is too busy pushing initial jabs onto the low risk 18+ and 12+ age groups, while the vulnerable 60+ to 90+ groups who received their initial jabs in Feb-March all have to wait until July and August for their second jab.  The Canada media echo chamber pushed the narrative that younger folks are winding up in hospital, but the average age of COVID hospitalizations and deaths in Canada's Wave 3 has only dropped by 12-months.  It is still old folks ending up in hospital and dying, and most of them have had just one jab. It is no longer about following the science, it is about cajoling as many people into getting the jab, and unless they change course, Canada will not be able fully reopen until late August. Contagious stupidity at all levels or the invisible overlords' shaking our jar - take your pick. </p>
