    <strong>Canadians, what's your experience?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Canada and from my experience things aren't getting better here. You hear of the one off rebel business (Support Adamson BBQ!) but the general consensus from people I talk to is they're more scared than ever. I'm also worried because the protests seem to be dieing down not picking up as I thought it would with the new lockdowns, perhaps that's due to the winter cold I don't know. How are we going to get out of this thing? I've started speaking up in my friend group more aggressively about how we need to get over this shit already but I don't know if that'll work. </p>
<p>What's you're experience? Please tell me I'm wrong and it's just my social circle who are doomers.</p></p>
