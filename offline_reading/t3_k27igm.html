        <p>People who can not see through this bullshit. Here in Uk we are not allowed alcohol in pubs unless it comes with a meal. I mean how in the actual fuck this has any relevance in a <em>pandemic</em>?</p>

        <p>Rationale is probably that drunk people are less likely to follow The Rules™.</p>
<p>I mean it's ridiculous, and pretentious. Drinking is a god damn national past time here, and pubs are the most British thing ever. During the war they remained open, even if a bomb blew up in the garden they'd clear the rubble and pour a pint. There was no government demanding you have a "substantial meal" with your beverage.</p>

        <p>There is a sports bar that has been open in my area though this whole thing. Nobody cares. If you are scared, don’t go there. It’s not fair to force people into poverty. It very hard to keep a biz open. Most make the $$$ off the booze.</p>

        <p>I hate the way people mock poor people and working class. I see a lot of mocking like “but muh economy.” They are using “muh” to mock poor people who didn’t have the opportunity to go to college. It is a dog whistle for rednecks and southerners. These are gamers, truck drivers, etc. The “uneducated class.” </p>
<p>Also, the economy is not just rich people playing the stock market. It is people going to work so they can pay their bills. </p>
<p>Yet again the liberals mock the poor. They assume anyone that is worried about how they are going to pay their rent is an uneducated redneck.</p>

        <p>I’m an atheist. But I did join a support group for people that had abusive parents. A lot of the people there said their faith in god is the only reason they where able to get through the trauma. One girl was raped by her stepfather and said it was her church that helped her heal. </p>
<p>Also, a lot of churches are helping people going through bad economic times. A lot of food banks are funded by churches.</p>
<p>About porn: porn is toxic. I feel sorry for young girls growing up today that are being brainwashed into believing sex should be violent and painful for them.</p>

        <p>There is a post on TrollX about this. They all think it is "empowering" to do sex work. To make money sell pics of your tits and ass on OnlyFans. Women have options now. We can go to college. In the olden days, they didn't have these options. They were forced into sex work. It was not empowering then. It is not empowering now.</p>

        <p>Don’t make me pick </p>
<p>I hate the masks. I hate that I could lose my job if I’m caught with my sweat soaked mask under my nose at work </p>
<p>I don’t mind the social distancing cuz get out my bubble but “only 4 people allowed in elevator, stand on these stickers” and like only so many people allowed in a store or the other day I went to fix my phone at Apple and they had me wait at the end of the line to talk to someone. Which, well of course. But wait. The line starts 30 feet from the store. And there’s one guy standing there waiting. Like. Wtf is this shit??? </p>
<p>I hate the card reader being handed to me at a drive thru cuz instead of one person touching the card reader all day it’s every single person getting food </p>
<p>The mentality that if you’re not wearing a mask or you’re out doing something “not essential” then you’re “putting people in danger” is so absurd to me. It annoys me so badly </p>
<p>It’s all annoying</p>

        <p><em>Since</em> Communism? This is basically the same shit rearing its ugly head yet again. Not there yet, but so many signs and contrived circumstances point to this situation being cynically exploited to usher in their delusional utopian and anti-human vision. The fact that the very ideal of freedom is being mocked and spat on by the very same individuals who have enjoyed the highest quality of life in history in large part <em>because</em> of this freedom is insane.</p>

        <p>Mine is a little different, and much more personal; with the exception of the mask nonsense and the specific wording, all of the others I saw with the Apatriot act and its related nonsense. </p>
<p>Mine is that so many people just expected I'd go along with it.  People who stood and watched as I bled for what I believed in.  That's not a metaphor, either- I genuinely thought I was going to die, and if they'd been thinking, they would've thought so, too.  I don't blame them for not acting; panic can make a coward of even the bravest people, but if <em>that</em> doesn't convince you that I won't be ruled by fear, what will?  A scared teenager with his whole life ahead of him stands in the face of nigh-certain death, but a disgruntled middle-aged man barely making enough to get by is going to cower in the face of a disease with a less than 1% chance to kill me?</p>

        <p>I try to find a renewed sense of purpose in rebellion and resistance. Cope, perhaps, but it's similar to my attitude toward the universe in general. I wake up and do what I can to rise to the challenge of thwarting the cosmic (and much more grounded / politically personified) forces which try to tip me over the edge. Like, fuck you all, what little shred of fight I still have left in me I'm gonna direct toward denying these sadists the pleasure of seeing me cave to sorrow and giving up. They'll have to kill me. Suicide isn't an option, no matter how much I might 'pray' for existential obliteration at the same time.</p>

        <p>First, it would be the forced mask mandate. I seriously despise how there is such a push everywhere to normalize it and businesses requiring you to have a mask on and if you don't then you are "putting everyone's lives in danger". What's next? No vaccine, no service! I'm worried that will likely occur. All complete and utter nonsense. Along with the mask, the ridiculous security theatre designed to make everyone feel "safe". Yeah, good luck it's not going to do anything against covid. </p>
<p>Second, my family virtue signaling and blindly believing everything mainstream media tells them without question. Their lack of critical thinking astounds me.  I'm tired of constantly hearing them regurgitate the same lies over and over in fear and they have blind faith for a vaccine. They just believe things won't ever get better until a vaccine and that makes me scream on the inside.  They better not scream at me to take the vaccine whenever it comes out.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the no vaccine no service narrative has been going for a while and various places across the globe are threatening that. All of this was called many months ago but, ya know, 'conspiracy theory'.</p>
<p>I have made a policy of, when and where I can, avoiding all Covid talk with (my few remaining) friends and family. Just walk out of the room. Don't get involved. Otherwise I just lose respect for them further, am stressed out and angry, etc... Bitter pills being swallowed all 2020. The only way I'm taking the vaccine is if they literally hold me down and force it into me. I've been in a similar position before and it was hell, and when the time comes it's definitely the line in the sand I won't cross, but I ain't exactly Rambo nor do I know how to grow my own food and live off the grid / away from government eyes, so who the fuck knows what'll happen.</p>
