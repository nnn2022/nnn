        <p>The majority of new polio cases are contracted by vaccine. The same way corporations rake in billions off of the military industrial complex and the for-profit prison system, they are gearing up to create a world of perpetual contagions to profit off of vaccinations. </p>
<p>In all cases, monetizing something causes it to exapand. Profit from arms=more wars. Profit from prison=more convictions. Profit from vaccines = (you do the math)</p>

        <p>Another way of saying this is that the vaccine (following the same criteria used to determine a covid death) is guaranteed to kill 7.35 million people, since that is the average number number of people that die in the world in 49 days.</p>
<p>They found that criteria fair in determining a "covid death" so no doubt they will use that same criteria to determine a "covid vaccine death".</p>
<p>Except they won't, because it is stupid, just as it was scammy as fuck to use for determining a "covid death".</p>

        <p>Where does the 1/723 come from?</p>
<p>I’m not here to argue - but I keep seeing this 99.8% survival bandied about like it is somehow factual.</p>
<p>US reports 3% fatality or 1/34
BC (where I reside) reports have been worse (about 1/28)</p>
<p>If we were to assume that the numbers are fluffed up (unrelated deaths and such) wouldn’t a more reasonable death rate be closer to 2% or so?  Or 1/50?</p>
<p>Did I miss someone break down that math because it seems to get thrown about a lot here.</p>
<p>I definitely don’t want to see the current state become the new normal and accept some risks in my behaviour, but I also don’t believe hyperbole is the solution.</p>
<p>I came to the sub not to fight, but to be educated in the ideology - I generally lurk but really feel like I need to understand this point</p>

        <p>Yes, you definitely missed the breakdown as all the sources are provided:</p>
<p>The WHO estimates that 750m people have been infected by covid based on antibody test results. </p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626</a></p>
<p>Source for number of deaths at the time (Oct 2, you can use the graph to get the exact figure for the date: 1,037,341 deaths) of the WHO's estimate:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/worldwide-graphs/#total-deaths">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/worldwide-graphs/#total-deaths</a></p>
<p>1,037,341 deaths/WHO estimated cases 750m = 1 death per 723 cases</p>
<p>This is on the low end, since the 750m estimate is based on antibody tests, but many people who were infected by covid never develop antibodies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563">https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563</a></p>
<p>\&rt; At least six studies have reported T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 in 20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus</p>
<p>\&rt; T cell studies documenting pre-existing reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in 20-50% of people suggest that antibodies are not the full story.</p>
<p>\&rt; Buggert’s study in Sweden seems to support this position. Investigating close family members of patients with confirmed covid-19, he found T cell responses in those who were seronegative or asymptomatic.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563#ref-10"><strong>10</strong></a> While around 60% of family members produced antibodies, 90% had T cell responses. (Other studies have reported similar results.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563#ref-27"><strong>27</strong></a>) “So many people got infected and didn’t create antibodies,” concludes Buggert.</p>
<p>\&rt;1/34 BC (where I reside) reports have been worse (about 1/28)</p>
<p>As far as I know, Canada hasn't been doing any antibody tests at all, let alone T-cell tests.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia, where I live, has always had a very strict criteria for who they will test:</p>
<p>- you travelled abroad within 14 days and have 2 or more symptoms</p>
<p>What this means is that cases are vastly under-reported. I caught something very covid like at the end of January, but there is 0 ways to have me reported as a covid survivor. 80% of cases are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and those people would never be tested according to the criteria that has been established. </p>
<p>If you look at China's numbers, and other countries as well, but China specifically since May, they have 3400 cases and 0 deaths.</p>
<p>If you look at Canada's numbers, we only have 161 deaths as of last week outside of old-age care facilities.</p>
<p>So, numbers of tested vs death are highly deceptive. </p>
<p>In Canada, 92% of people who had covid and died were marked as a covid death. That includes folks with late stage terminal cancers and those who had fatal car accidents. In the UK, that number is 100%.</p>
<p>So, anything that can be counted remotely as a Covid death is, but the government has ensured that the actual number of covid infections is hard to know. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-children-antibody-study-1.5824520">https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/covid-19-children-antibody-study-1.5824520</a></p>
<p>This is saying that as of now, some antibody testing will be done in BC. The problem is that antibodies have a 36 day half-life. In other words, if I did have it in January, I'd have 1/512 of the antibodies left and probably wouldn't show up on a test.</p>
<p>A recent report out of Italy showed that 11.6% of blood samples taken from cancer patients in September 2019 showed that they had had covid antibodies at that time. </p>
<p>And yet, the first covid death in Italy wasn't recorded until Feb 21, 2020, 5 months later. </p>
<p>How could 11.6% of cancer patients have it by September and yet no one noticed it until late February? </p>
<p>Fast forward to today, Italy has 8 x the number of daily cases, yet the same number of daily deaths compared to the March/April period.</p>
<p>If we look at the recorded death rate at July 17 in Italy, around 35k dead/243k cases = \~15% death rate. </p>
<p>Since July 17th, an additional 1,464,000 cases, 25,000 deaths or 1.7% death rate.</p>
<p>So, you either believe that covid caused a 0% death rate for 5 months, a \~15% death rate for 5 months and then a 1.7% death rate for 5 months or you realize it's all about how they record the numbers.</p>

        <p>Some issues with numbers, but as you say they can often be rearranged here to tell a particular story.  </p>
<p>I tend to mainly just use the active cases from worldometer which seems to grab reporting that are official into the spread.  </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I can tell you over 3 months of teaching 120 students, the tests (nose to brain tickler) don’t seem to spew that many false positives.  I’ve been made aware of no less than 15 tests for students I taught, with only one positive. So, anecdotally they don’t seem to want to slap Covid on everything.</p>
<p>The long-term care facilities are indeed tough to measure, but being terminally ill doesn’t negate the fact that the disease seems to rip through these already immune-compromised people.  But what constitutes a covid death in those cases has been shown to be sketchy in places.</p>
<p>Anyway - I’m pretty content to see some data nonetheless.  Differing interpretations are pretty damn valid reasons for a difference of opinions about this pandemic.</p>
<p>All the best - thanks for indulging me.</p>

<p>Not really sure what that means. </p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/nyregion/new-york-city-antibody-test.html</p>
<p>August 19, 2020 </p>
<p>"Across the city, more than 27 percent of those tested had positive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibody-testing.html">antibody results</a>. “</p>
<p>They performed 1.46m antibody tests. Are you saying these are official numbers of aren't?</p>
<p>South Africa also did large scale antibody testing (I believe each test was around $3) and showed a similar result with New York.</p>
<p>Are you saying that these results don't count?</p>
<p>I linked above that T-cell immunity has been achieved in a greater population than is displaying antibodies, so it's scientifically, repeatedly been shown that the antibody count will be less than the true count of those infected by covid.</p>
<p>So, despite it being scientifically shown that more 27% of New Yorkers had had covid prior to August 19th while the worldometer only recorded under a tenth of that, you will go with the worldometer numbers because...</p>

        <p>I use the worldometer metrics because they are taking it from the health authority reports of a positive test.</p>
<p>The antibody data validates part of the conclusion, in that those who develop antibodies have contacted the virus.</p>
<p>However, I don’t tend to see a case where someone doesn’t get ill (maybe not even a carrier) as a covid case.</p>
<p>Again, none of the numbers are false - we are seeing the metrics differently.</p>
<p>To shift this slightly, is there still talk of herd immunity?  I still am hopeful that is still a possibility, but there have also been articles about second cases developing in recovered victims.  Is that now debunked or is that still a possibility?</p>
