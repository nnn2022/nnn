    <strong>How the worldwide madness helps you get more self-reliance</strong>
    <p><p>The statement</p>
<p>&rt;Yes you had symptoms and yes people died, yet never from covid. It were always other well known diseases that doctors neglect in favor of the current narrative, that everything was caused by covid.</p>
<p>is very helpful, when it comes to diseases in general.</p>
<p>You realize how doctors work:</p>
<p>&rt;Symptom A? Must be disease B.</p>
<p>Instead of how they should:</p>
<p>&rt;Symptom A? Could be disease B. But also C. But also D. But also ...</p>
<p>Therefore if the most common cause is not accurate, which one is the next likely one?</p>
<p>So if you get a diagnosis, know that the first shot in the dark does not always hit the target.</p>
<p>Also, always focus on solutions, ie therapies that work, not problems.</p></p>

        <p>I'll usually catch the cold once or twice a year, sometimes a heavy dose that I consider to be flu-like, I deal with a lot of people and see a lot of people and I've never blamed anyone for biological terrorism, nor have I ever let it bother me it is what it is, it's called the common-cold for a fucking reason. Granted I haven't had as much as a sniffle since the Corona started, I can't lie the masks, distancing and general hygiene probably have a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>But I'm still prone to getting the cold. Although these days if I caught it, I doubt anyone would assume it's the cold and that's troubling. It's like no other virus exists anymore other than The Rona, and that's due to the fact that this specific Coronavirus appears to have an incredibly wide range of symptoms, that almost feel made up. Definitely not saying the virus doesn't exist, but plenty other shit out there too and have been there our entire lives for generations.</p>
