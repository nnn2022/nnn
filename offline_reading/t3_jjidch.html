        <p>Depends on which country. These Asian countries - Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, have been commended on their response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>Singapore carries out more tests, and to add on to my post, we do contact tracing, which means we notify people who have come into close contact of suspected cases, in order to ringfence the spread.</p>
<p>Taiwan was quick to implement mask wearing, together with contact tracing, more tests and a 14 day quarantine, helped to keep their situation under control.</p>
<p>South Korea controlled the outbreak with rapid mass testing, without having to resort to lockdowns, despite their church cluster in March.</p>
<p>Vietnam controlled the pandemic well early on in Jan-Jun, and had no deaths for a while, due to testing and contact tracing. However, they experienced a 2nd wave, and their first death in July.</p>

        <p>Are you going to actually look at data, or merely downvote?</p>
<p>US is ranked #152 for Influenza deaths per population.</p>
<p>Let's compare the countries quoted:</p>
<p>-US: 10.85 per 100K</p>
<p>-Singapore: 69.92</p>
<p>-South Korea: 21</p>
<p>-Vietnam: 17.07</p>
<p>-Thailand: 47.82</p>
<p>Countries like Italy, France, UK are well under 10 deaths per 100K population. Of course its further complicated by the fact that it shows a single number.</p>
<p>If the Asian countries are so conformist and most wear masks due to their culture and follow the rules strictly why is their Influenza number higher than the countries that aren't like that? I know Singapore is especially strict in that regard. 24% of overall mortality is due to Influenza in Singapore while in the US its under 3%(the top being coronary heart disease).</p>
<p>Another possibility is that in previous years the countries with low death counts in 2020 due to Influenza had more in 2018-2019, and vice versa. Certainly there are analysis out there that shows the correlation. I also know US's numbers regarding the 1918 Flu is lower than in other countries. Perhaps the immunity being afforded by being exposed to it and not dying has more of an impact than anyone thinks! There's also a cyclical nature to everything.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't bet on masks/measures. Why should they work there but not in a place like Germany? What I would bet on is genetic factors, pre immunity, climate, overall health, etc. The difference between Asia and Latin America supports this. Africa would be an interesting comparison too. The tale of "Asian NPCs wear masks when they take a shit and drink gallons of disinfectant" really needs to be debunked, it's garbage.</p>

        <p>Asia has been on edge regarding viruses from China ever since SARS 1. They had infrastructure in place and a cultural preparedness to deal with the virus, and who knows, possibly already had a large amount of immunity given their proximity to China itself.</p>
<p>Social distancing certainly hasn't been a factor given how crowded most Asian city streets get, and masks can't be claimed as the savior either given that usage has gone up exponentially in the West, yet surges are still out of control.</p>

        <p>Agree on the preparedness part to some extent, when Singapore was hit by SARS in 2003, and H1N1 in 2009-2010. Our country was said to have <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-sars-lessons-wuhan-coronavirus-virus-plans-lessons-12380842">learnt from SARS back in Feb</a>, and we first had a cluster of Bangladeshi dorm workers contracting the virus in Feb, but it was contained quickly in time.</p>
<p>However in March, we were most certainly unprepared for the sudden surge in migrant worker cases, as clusters started forming rapidly in other dorms. </p>
<p>Aside from the Government's <a href="https://time.com/5824039/singapore-outbreak-migrant-workers/">foreign worker dorm mismanagement</a>, Singapore's community cases and transmission remains low as of currently.</p>

        <p>I think part of the initial surprise from Covid was due to everyone in Asia expecting the next virus to come from China, since for whatever reason when new viruses pop up in Asia they almost always originate from China.</p>
<p>There was probably a sentiment of "as long as China isn't worried, we have nothing to worry over". </p>
<p>China's delayed response allowed it to spread unknown to anyone for who knows how long in China, then it was covered up for a while, and then only later did China tell everyone else something was wrong. Prior to that time frame, Covid was probably spreading out of China to the rest of Asia without anyone even knowing there was a virus to react to.</p>

        <p>Here in Singapore, we have 57,000+ cases and 28 deaths. Our country's death rate is considered the lowest in the world (Source: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2680TH">https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2680TH</a>) Our Ministry of Health also excludes patients who died from other causes from the fatality count.</p>
<p>However, the bulk of out country's cases are foreign migrant workers from Bangladesh living in dormitories, mostly working in construction. Our country went into a partial lockdown (dubbed a Circuit Breaker) while the government settled the dorm cases. They did mass testing for these workers (all 323K of them) to stop and prevent the spread. Since these workers are young (mid-late 20s to 30s), they were also quick to recover, which explains our high number of cases but low fatality rate.</p>
<p>A task force was set up and they quickly carried out testing for vulnerable groups of people, such as seniors in elderly care homes. Tests were carried out for preschool teachers and staff as well. Testing for workers who interact frequently with the public (eg. F&amp;B hawkers, deliverymen) is underway. In fact, testing is mandatory for all individuals aged 13 and above with acute respiratory infection in clinics.</p>
<p>During Jan, when our first few cases were imported from China, mask wearing was encouraged, but not enforced. It was only after local community cases began to spike in around Feb-Mar, when our government made wearing of masks compulsory in April. Mask wearing was made mandatory the minute you step out of the house, and failing to wear a mask in public will get you fined. Singaporeans, who are docile in general, simply complied with the compulsory mask wearing rule.</p>
<p>Overall, the reason why Singapore contained the virus so well, is due to mandatory mask wearing and massive testing of selected groups of people.</p>

        <p>You can simply see from the economic data. The only major economy to show growth is China, the country that's suspiciously low in numbers, despite India with similar population being much much higher, and about to surpass the US in cases to be number one.</p>
<p>So rest of the world is also staying at home, refusing to go to restaurants, stores, and have lost jobs.</p>

        <p>That's a load of nonsense.</p>
<p>A country of 1.3-1.4 billion simply avoided it because of hard lockdown when its numbers were at tens of thousands when literally every other single country shows otherwise.</p>
<p>Don't you think you are playing into the lockdown everything narrative? Do you know China is the model they use for locking everything down?</p>

        <p>You’re proving my point. Tens of thousands were infected, most of them found during a hard lockdown. Making it possible to identify who and isolate until the virus passes. Allowing them to reopen</p>

        <p>Ah, so you are pro-lockdown, just doing it subtly.</p>
<p>Nope. It started in October during Wuhan. Hard lockdown didn't come until 2 months later.</p>

        <p>Because we actually cared about covid at first and went full lockdown, since not many people actually went out and we had tighter restrictions. The pandemic ended quicker for us</p>

        <p>That is frankly absurd. Lockdowns do not stop an epidemic of a highly contagious disease, at most they slow it down temporarily.</p>
