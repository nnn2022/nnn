        <p>‚ÄúProven safe beyond a shadow of a doubt‚Äù No they haven‚Äôt, but we believe that they have been because that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre told- by the same people pushing these experimental ones as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Billions have been paid out in vaccine injury courts- and that‚Äôs low compared to what should be paid out. We have no long term safety studies on vaccines. Recently a doctor and scientist put out a 10 year study comparing the health of the vaccinated to the non vaccinated, and the non vaccinated were healthier. The medical and science community attacked them over it and the doctor had his license suspended- with the medical board using a ridiculous reason for doing so. We should all want to know the truth on what they do to our bodies long term- and the community owes it to the public to do these studies. The MMR vaccine is dangerous, there were scientists warning about it who were shut up- just like so many are being shut up now. Japan even banned it. The polio vaccine has a terrible history along with the fact that the oral version of it was spreading polio in poor countries. </p>
<p>If you think these current batches of vaccines are the first time they‚Äôve been doing shady things with them, look deeper. You might be surprised by what you find. Organizations like the CDC, who create the vaccine schedule, hold vaccine patents themselves and receive royalties. They‚Äôre also the ones mostly in charge of vaccine information- but no conflict of interest there. 
Also- the government protecting vaccine makers from injury lawsuits should be a huge red flag that something‚Äôs off about them. In the US, vaccine doses went from around 5 before manufacturers became immune from lawsuits- to 72 when including pregnancy doses. Why should they worry about safety, when they‚Äôre not responsible for what happens to people who use their products?</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre leery about the way this pandemic has been handled- just remember the same people are behind all the other vaccines. This is just the first time they‚Äôve been so intently focused on due to the media and the newness of one of the technologies. The censorship for anyone questioning these vaccines despite people being injured and killed by them- and the fact that governments are paying billions to ‚Äúcombat‚Äù vaccine hesitancy- should make us all leery of those pushing them as safe. And wonder if they‚Äôve lied to us in the past as well. </p>
<p>Check this video out from another time when the government (not sure of your location but this is from the US) scared the population into a risky jab. https://youtu.be/4bOHYZhL0WQ</p>

        <p>Okay, well if everyone knows ONE person that had a single adverse reaction to anything, then we could say that basically any drug or vaccine isn't safe. </p>
<p>My main point was that because the MMR, polio and chicken pox vaccines have been around for decades, they are not experimental in the same manner the Wuhan inoculation is.</p>

        <p>I got the same treatment. I asked them if my opinions are so wrong and everyone on the sub is much smarter than me, why should it matter what I say. If I'm just going to get heavily downvoted and ignored anyway. But I guess even a small dissenting voice is too much for them to handle.</p>
