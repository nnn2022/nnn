    <strong>Based nail stylist</strong>
    <p><p>They say it's usually the more masculine stores like build supply-stores that are more based and the more feminine shops like hairdressers and nail salons are all real nazis on the regulations, but today I'm pretty pleased. I got my nails done professionally today for the first time since like December 2019 I believe. And had a good talk with my nail stylist. I'd been to see her twice before but like i said that was a looong time ago now. </p>
<p>When I made the appointment I checked and double checked they would not require masks as the mask mandate in my country no longer goes inside public buildings. Then I arrived today and the hairdressers and nail stylists in the salon were all masked, which kinda worried me. They said that they chose to do so cause "not everyone at the salon has been vaccinated" but that customers could choose for themselves to mask or not to mask. So i went maskless of course but i was kinda irritated. </p>
<p>But my nail stylist was super cool! She's only a little older than I am, and she's "one of us" pretty much. Doesn’t care much for all these rules. Said she doesn't want to get the vaccine until 2023 when the trials end but that if she ever talks about it to her colleagues she gets crucified basically. We had a lovely chat about bonkers corona-measures, stupid curfews, the corona vaccine and vaccination in general. </p>
<p>I normally only get my nails done once a year but I liked chatting to this girl so I may go back sooner.</p></p>

        <p>It’s the small businesses regardless of what services they provide that should be the most based. Marxists hate private property and want wish to abolish it! That includes your body, the most sacred private property.</p>

        <p>It's so crazy thst it's an event for us when we encounter a rational person. Same happened to me with my hair stylist. She made a statement in her newsletter email that she will not be discussing the vaccine or vaccination status, she isn't concerned with her clients status and she wont be discussing hers. I wrote back to her and thanked her for speaking out. She was always the  stereotypical NYer , most of whom are hard core masks and vaccines and pro lockdown. I am assuming the past two years has been extremely hard on her and possibly it woke her up. Having your livelihood yanked from you for a significant period of time will do that. She has struggled a lot financially and mentally during this shit show. I wonder how people who had their right to earn a living taken from them are feeling about this overall. I bet many are like your nail lady and my hairdresser. I remember at one point her commenting salons were closed and restaurants were open in NYC and salons were open and restaurants were closed in Texas and none of it made sense.</p>

        <p>Yeah hair stylists and nail salons were among several groups hit pretty hard as a "contact profession". They have a name for all being doomers in these feminine style shops or professions, but I have a quiet hope that being so harshly shut down when cafes and restaurants were opening  will wake some of them up.<br>
Of course  Gyms and sport-schools are even worse. Those are still closed over here even now that nail salons are open</p>

        <p>The gym owners seem like a real tough bunch. Lots of them have been defying orders and getting massive fines and locked out of their own places. My other hair person (colorist) has been adhering to orders so he can earn a living. I get it. City inspectors come into His salon at least two to three times a week and look around, if there's a person not wearing a mask they get a giant fine. He just wants to earn a living and not deal with this bullshit. So he wears a mask and asks everyone else to and takes temperatures like they require etc. But I get the feeling he's really not that into it either. He just wants to be able to pay his bills. Since the beginning of this whole thing he has been mixing up my color and dropping by my house with it so I can apply at myself since his Salon was forced to close. He managed to figure out a way to continue working to some degree during this whole thing.</p>

        <p>I was working doing canvassing in PDX for about 3 months before the pandemic. Since my company got shut down for the pandemic, I have been on unemployment for almost a year now. </p>
<p>Which is just wild. I also got in on GME and it's my birthday in a month. Hopefully my first with generational wealth in my back pocket.</p>
