    <strong>I’m going to a casino</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone else been to one since the world sucked? I’m worried I will be sitting in a glass room handing my money to a slot machine and just not having an enjoyable experience. I guess I just want to know if I should just hang in the room and enjoy the time away, or if the floor will have any semblance of normal enjoyment.</p></p>

        <p>Lower your expectations.  I was in Reno in the summer and it was pretty weird.  There are clear plastic dividers between almost everywhere people sit next to each other including slot machines and even card tables.</p>
<p>To describe it more clearly, there is a plastic divider between every seat at the card tables and probably something in front of the dealer too.</p>
<p>Also, masks are probably required but presumably you should be able to circumvent it if you are a smoker, haha.  At one place I was at, they were actually enforcing putting your mask on BETWEEN BITES and sips of your drink.</p>
<p>Results might vary between casinos though.</p>

        <p>I don’t know about other states, but casinos in Oklahoma are pretty much open for business. From what I’ve heard, they “enforce” masks/temperature checks but in reality it’s impossible to enforce - especially with the amount of drinking and smoking. Capacity is sort of limited, but you can still play table games with limited seating.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s unlikely that anyone in a casino right now is truly concerned about covid. The casino itself, maybe, but not the guests. I recommend giving it a shot. If it sucks it sucks, but if it doesn’t then you might end up meeting some new people and having a good time!</p>

        <p>Went to Vegas over the summer. Lots of security theater, but it’s mostly limited to the casino floor. Still a good time, overall, but honestly we didn’t gamble at all.</p>

        <p>I was in Vegas twice in November to escape this hell hole where I live. (Bay Area, not my fault I was born and raised here). Some casinos put clear dividers between the dealers and the patrons. Some do not. Slot machines are all open. Masks must be worn at all times inside the casino unless actively drinking or smoking, and they are very strict on this. Outside nobody cares if you do or don’t wear a mask. </p>
<p>Most shows and clubs aren’t open but almost everything else is. If you’re looking to gamble, drink, and eat, you will have a good time. Restaurants all require “reservations” per state order but it’s not a problem.</p>
