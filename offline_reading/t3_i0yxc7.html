        <p>I really hope the dine-in places survive.  I really do, but I just can't support them anymore until this shit goes back to the old normal.  I tried going back to them when the lockdown ended, but then they made masks mandatory, but only from the door to your table.  </p>
<p>I am supposed to put on a mask and walk to my table where I remove my mask; because the virus only affects people who aren't sitting down.   Then, when I'm done eating, I'm supposed to wear the mask in order to walk back out of the restaurant. </p>
<p>It makes no sense for anyone to do that except for theater and ritual; neither of which interest me when going to get some food that I am able to cook at home myself without having to wear a mask that's already given me a bad rash on my chin.  I'm supposed to pay money for people to serve me food when they aren't even allowed to treat me any better than a diseased idiot.  No thanks.</p>
<p>Unless things go back to the way they used to be, I'll eat at home.  Cooking is not that hard.</p>

        <p>I can handle the mask to the table thing.  But I heard there are some restaurants that require you to put your mask on whenever the waiter approaches.  No way.</p>

        <p>Yeah fuck that. I'm not going to let someone treat me that way if I'm paying them.  I mean think about it... These people are handling your food and bringing it to you. The least they can do is return the same trust I'm showing them.</p>

        <p>&rt;“If the next round of stimulus doesn’t make a major effort to save these independent operators — something bigger than the paycheck protection program — then you can say goodbye to your favorite place to eat, unless they can hold on until the now dreamed of vaccine somehow arrives,” Cramer said.</p>
<p>Or maybe we could reopen restaurants? Maybe that's a solution?</p>

        <p>This echoes a lot of the talk around my house right now. My husband and I have a combined 35 years in the industry. We both have degrees in the humanities, and he has an advanced degree in religious studies. We've done other things from time to time, especially me, but this industry is his career. His passion. He is really good at what he does and has worked hard at it. He started as a server, worked his way through kitchens of all kinds. He's been an executive at a chain, gone back to kitchens and worked his way back up, and finally landed a great position as the executive chef in a chef-driven concept. Lots of creative freedom, wonderful backers. It's basically the dream job. They were open for TWO DAYS before the lockdowns hit. They have made a remarkable recovery from that, and then survived another shut down for a positive test. I don't know how long we can survive if things don't return to normal--or very close--soon. Most restaurants are not built for carry out alone. I have no idea what we will be able to do to support ourselves if the industry dries up and blows away.</p>
