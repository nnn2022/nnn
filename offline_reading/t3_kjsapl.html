        <p>The story of our age is the story of how envy has been exploited, how it has been leveraged for financial gain and for power and control under the guise of equality, fairness, and the common good. During the ongoing psychological operation known as the worldwide response to covid-19, we have witnessed these machinations at work and much of what separates those of us who question the official narrative from the stay-at-home doomers who are so adamant in their support of it, is envy.      </p>
<p>For nine months now, weâ€™ve been told by these bullies and petty dictators that by not blindly following the rules set forth by the powers that be we are murderous, grandma-killing psychopaths. Many in this crowd see an opportunity to be virtuous and noble through passive heroics- staying at home, wearing the mask, getting the vaccine and scolding others to do the same. They ascribe our appeals to freedom, self-reliance and courage as a selfish wanton disregard for others, as anti-intellectualism and a lack of empathy and education. They see in us the very qualities they lack themselves and the invective they hurl at us is merely a projection of their own powerlessness.</p>
