    <strong>Suspicious quotes from a pharmacist</strong>
    <p><p>So i went out to get my mom’s diabetes meds. Let’s call the pharmacists W (the woman) &amp; M (the man). So as W is handing me my mom’s pills, I ask her, “so, what’s happening now with the flu? Are they still diagnosing it or is everything COVID now?” Man... shoulda worded that better. Even then, the answer I got was fucking “interesting,” to say the least.</p>
<p>M told me, “Used to be we got a flu case every week. Now, we’ve only had 2 since late August (3 months). Because the masks have been protecting against flu. Because COVID is more contagious.” When I asked in response, “so is everything covid now?” he just replied, “covid is the last thing we check for. First, we run the tests for all the other flus &amp; colds, &amp; then after ruling all that out, we do the covid test.” I think what this actually means is “we test for covid first &amp; covid only.” Not wanting a confrontation &amp; wanting to get out of there as fast as possible, I was just like, “I see” &amp; moved on.</p>
<p>Assume 3 months, a quarter of a year, is 13 weeks. Now, 13/2 = 6.5; 1-(1/6.5) = 1-15% = 85%. According to this guy, flu cases are down 85% at my pharmacy, in my home neighbourhood, from last year to this year. And NOBODY finds that suspicious. The shifting of masks’ purpose from “it protects against covid” to “it protects against flu.” More bullshit.</p>
<p>Strap in, boyos &amp; girlos. We’re in for a much longer, rougher ride than we thought. Have a feeling this might be the “new normal” after all if we don’t take back what’s rightfully ours, en masse (which I don’t think will even come close to happening).</p>
<p>EDIT: this is as non-suspicious as 100% of Biden’s votes going to all counties in several swing states. HAIL THE GREAT RESET &amp; BUILDING BACK BETTER! (please don’t kill me, o glorious tech overlords. Totally not /s).</p></p>

        <p>The CDC admits they wont be recording flu cases. All flu, pneumonia and covid diagnosis are lumped together since October, hence this new "spike in cases".
This plandemic has all always been pushed by deceptively presenting the statistics.</p>

        <p>What I’m worried about, as you saw in this conversation, is they’re gonna push the mask conversation from “protecting against covid” to “protecting against flu,” which means that we’re gonna be in lockdown 8 months of the year (September-May) going forward. Didn’t wanna believe it but here we are.</p>

        <p>98% of flu cases are down worldwide (it's not actually down, everything is the 'rona now) but don't speak against THE ScIeNcE and narrative, they'd burst into flames if you used any common sense or logic around folks like that lol</p>
