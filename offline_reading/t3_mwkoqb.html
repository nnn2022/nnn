    <strong>Story Time: USPS Edition</strong>
    <p><p>I had to go to the post office today. There was no way around it. I wasn't particularly happy after reading this morning they're using the USPS as a private spy agency, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>I walked in smiling, everyone masked up. Walked up to the sweet teller [or whatever you call them] and she complimented me on my outfit. I thanked her with another big smile, and said I needed to pick up a parcel that was oversized and undeliverable to my address.</p>
<p>She began looking into it, so I stepped aside by the wall as another young woman walked in. She was in a much skimpier outfit, fiddling with her phone, but didn't have a mask on. As soon as she got up to the line, one of the butchy, ratty bleach-blonde tellers yelled, 'I'm going to need you to put a mask on." She replies, "Oh! I'm so sorry! I must have left it in the car!" and was handed a mask.</p>
<p>Mind you, I'm standing in the corner, in full view of everyone who just got done looking at me with malice and hate in their eyes, without said mask on, but now a huge, fixed shit eating grin. I stood here for ten minutes smiling like a jackass waiting for them to locate the parcel.</p>
<p>I was called back over to the counter, so I started playing it up, praising the supervisor for her attention and told all of the tellers, "God Bless you, won't you have a wonderful rest of your day?" as I walked out the door.</p>
<p>You will win. Stand tall. They know they can't fuck with the strong ones.</p></p>

        <p>I've noticed that in a couple places, too. Also, I was very pleased that one of the grocery stores in my area that never really enforced masks has replaced their old standard "Masks must be worn inside" signs with a new one that says, "Per the governor's order, non-medical grade masks must be worn inside." It struck me as a form of malicious compliance which tickled me.</p>

        <p>You're not sick.</p>
<p>Just keep repeating it. You are not sick. You don't need a mask.</p>
<p>They can fumble over their words all they want. But you got papa Fauci on your side on this one. In the history of the world asymptomatic carriers have never been the main drivers of a pandemic for a respiratory illness.</p>
