    <strong>What your plan for the vaccine passport?</strong>
    <p><p>I read that they are going to use paper for a while but they are eventually going to move on to tattoos. I am going to try and pay a doctor to say they gave it me. What is the gameplay for everyone else?</p></p>

        <p>I will recede from society and become a nomad. At that point society is not worth it to me, personally. Well, it is already getting to that point even without the medical passport. They overplayed their hands with the masks. I will not participate in another step toward a mark of the beast system.</p>

        <p>How will you eat as a nomad? How about work? It's easy to say I will be a nomad but even without the government coming after you losing the convince of society is pretty damn hard.</p>
<p>They didn't overplay anything considering everyone is still wearing one.</p>

        <p>I am speaking from my personal perspective. I mean for me, they overplayed their hand with the masks. I see through it totally. There is no question in my mind as to whether they are effective/ineffective whether it is ok or not. Again, from my point of view, if they had eased up on the compulsory masks, I may have fallen for the vaccine and medical passports or whatever. But to me it is out in the open, utter, total tyranny over the human being and there isn't any grey area for me with this issue. I feel utterly subjugated and attacked, as a human being and as a Christian. I pray I will have the strength to do what is necessary to save my own soul. And honestly, each passing day that the world conforms to this "new normal" the easier it looks to become nomadic, go hungry, even die a miserable death in the streets amongst the homeless. To me there is more dignity in that then to go along to get along just to be a slave with invisible chains amongst other slaves who love their slavery and rebuke me if I show my human face.</p>

        <p>Maybe when we all reach our breaking points we can find some place to come together with like minded people and perhaps make a better life for people like us. Maybe we can be like the amish and sustain ourselves with minimal interaction with the slave-state. Who knows what the future holds. But I am constantly trying to strengthen my mind and reiterate to myself how wrong all of this is and I hope that I will be strong enough to break free before it is too late.</p>

        <p>Where? Even if we do the communist government will kill us like they do to all dissenters. The Amish has the blessing or apathy of the government we will not have that luxury. Go out in public without a mask for a day see how well that goes for you then triple that. Anyone who doesn't go along with the program will eventually be killed off. Probably by average Joe or at least reported by him. I have a pretty good idea I think not too bright for anyone on either side.</p>

        <p>The government kills nobody; life and death are in the hands of God. You go when your time comes. This faith is incredibly liberating. And there's always a way out, but you have to pray for it.</p>

<p>...Okay, then why are you here? Might as well just sit on your hands with a fake smile, and just wait for death. Why fight the "new normal"? It'll be "fine", because we will "go when our time comes" anyway! So why even bother with any of this if the endgame is to die and go to heaven?</p>

        <p>You can simultaneously have faith in god and also fight against tyranny. Destruction of the spirit and faith is half the reason these people don't give a fuck what happens to themselves and others. I personally believe in higher powers that guide me and others who listen, and those higher powers can lead you to resources, people to help you, etc. I only survived being homeless by God guiding me to the right places and people. Its not about sitting there and doing nothing, its listening to that inner voice that says "there is more to living than this"</p>

        <p>Never said God hated you, you have to be willing to have faith and listen. If you sit there pouting in self pity about how God doesn't love you and care about you, do you really think there is space for guidance to come through? Do you really think you're capable of hearing wisdom to guide you if you dismiss it as even being real and focus on how shitty everything is? Where your mind goes, your attention grows.</p>

        <p>Absolutely.

Where I live there are still people who remember ww2 and why exactly fascism is something you don't negotiate with, and you definitely don't want it for your children.</p>

        <p>They'll kill you and take your kids to "enlightenment camps" or just kill them to make an example of them. A ragtag bunch of neighbors can't take on the military no matter what country you are in. No, you don't negotiate with evil  or crazy but it won't stop most people from doing it in the name of convince or safety. And that shooting will just be used as propaganda to prove how dangerous guns  and how dangerous the alt-right are. We are all so boned.</p>

        <p>Dude, military personnel are people too, and getting people to shoot other people isn't as easy as you think. People will defend themselves and do whatever it takes not to die, absolutely, but when it comes to offensive action, you might want to look up how many frontline combat personnel actually targets enemies. You'll be surprised</p>

        <p>Exactly and if I have learned anything this last year it is that most people are sheep and will do whatever a guy in a suit says. But they still showed up and are firing a gun at someone and that ten percent is aiming to kill. There is not a lot of people like us and it does not take 100 men to kill 10 unarmed men it just takes one.</p>

        <p>If it gets bad enough I'm expecting at least 40% of military and Police to go AWOL.The best option is to refuse to comply with this agenda they are attempting to bring in.Anyone attempting to take your guns, when they come door to door well - I know what i would do personally.Theres really no point going along with the agenda, it won't end well.</p>

        <p>The military and police like most people are sheep they'll do whatever the guy in the suit says including putting a bullet in someone head who did nothing other then oppose the government. So long as their given some flimsy moral justification like they were a danger to others for not accepting the vaccine. Even if 40% leave the military and police they still have plenty of order followers with big guns. Most people will just give up their guns. I don't blame them a swat team comes in and your going to do whatever they tell you to. They already started with Canada any asshole can call a complaint or the government can just say they got one and then they can just raid your house and confiscate your gun and whatever else without a warrant.</p>

        <p>&rt; I am going to try and pay a doctor to say they gave it me </p>
<p>Not a bad idea. I checked how to get around mandatory drugging. There are immunosuppressants natural and synthetic on the market as well as methods to follow to nullify vaccine effect meaning the immune system will never mount an adaptive immune response. So you follow a protocol like this for few weeks and there you have it. </p>
<p>As of reaction to the scamdemic, remember everyone can cause damage. It's not a monopoly. Since the government decided to forbid my freedoms and destroy my life, I can bring enough destruction to this environment too with insignificant effort. I don't need to give you examples, there is an infinite number of possibilities to think of.</p>

        <p>No, I will not chill we are heading for a complete collapse with a  government lead by sociopaths with some sort of devil complex who will do everything in their power to keep power. They convinced everyone to wear a muzzle of submission despite the fact  it does not work and everyone knows it. They shut down the economy bankrupted just about every small business killing the middle class. Now Biden got in and will keep on devaluing our debt called money. Not they want us to get a rna vaccine pushed out in less then a year and people are still stupid enough to get under the guise of getting back to normal which we will not be ever if anything it this will just keep getting progressively worse. So in your opinion when will they go too far? What can't they pull off at this point?</p>

<li>Will be illegalized or become so expensive that you can't. Even use doordash? $5 turns to $15 real quick.</li>
<li>Will be illegalized. Helping "anti-vaxxors who are endangering us all" will be considered like helping a criminal.</li>
<li>Where? Government will be tracking down dissidents to make a example of as all communist countries do. Then what farm? You'll be an even bigger target communist LOVE stealing people food.</li>

        <p>You fear death too much. You are ethernal and life is a game. Just prepp, buy a slingshot, hammock, tarp, ferrocerium ,saw, knife and when you feel  shit hits the fan buy food and water supplies for 2 months. After that the earth will be yours, I will meet you and we will help each other. Stress is bad, lowers your defenses, just follow a good plan. Don't worry</p>

Even if I wasn't prepared and was killed off early I would still say I am luckier then the rest who will have to live literally like cattle.

<p>Bill Gates in the name of being green among with the government are cracking down on farmers anyone who knows anything about communism knows where that always inevitably goes. Government will probably seize the land of farmers soon. They'll probably make so many regulation they just go bankrupt. Like what they do with property tax.</p>

        <p>Well first off he’s not cracking down on farmers. He is buying farmland which is concerning. </p>
<p>There’s always a way for the human spirit. If you say no and mean it, you will find a way to feed yourself and meet other likeminded people. Have a little faith. And if you can buy land, do that if you expect farming to fail</p>

        <p>Right buying farmland should have make the difference. The government is cracking down on farmers though look up ice age farmer. But what I am worried about is that the government will just confiscate everything like all communist governments eventually do.</p>

        <p>There really hasn't been many peasant revolutions throughout history and even then its to the point where everyone is going to die in a months if something does not immediately change. Its usually other governments who does the overthrowing and we won't have the luxury because every country is in bed with each other. With maybe Russia being the one exception BIG maybe though. You take what the government offers you and if you don't they kill you or throw in a cell.</p>

        <p>The biggest impact on me during this scamdemic HAS been about international borders. If vaccine passports do actually set in stone, I will probably have to succumb to it.     <br>
I think it'll be easy for someone living in a large country like the USA to not take it, but I live in Singapore which lacks opportunities and leisure activities, plus a lot of my friends and family are scattered all over the globe. This sucks because I'm really not taking the vaccine for my safety nor health, it's just for freedom which is a horrible precedent that will be set for the future.</p>

<p>Your clearly new here if your going to take this experimental rna vaccine pushed out in less then a year with no liability.

        <p>As I said it's not really for my safety, it's just for my freedom. I've spoken out about the vaccine many times on this subreddit itself, im fairly active here.          <br>
But I haven't met a lot of my friends and extended family for the past year because of them being in other countries and I've been barred entry from there. What can I do? Not see them ever? In my scenario rolling the dice with the shot is the only way I can finally get my human rights back (unless vaccine passports dont become a thing).</p>

        <p>As I said it's not really for my safety, it's just for my freedom. I've spoken out about the vaccine many times on this subreddit itself, im fairly active here.          <br>
But I haven't met a lot of my friends and extended family for the past year because of them being in other countries and I've been barred entry from there. What can I do? Not see them ever? In my scenario rolling the dice with the shot is the only way I can finally get my human rights back (unless vaccine passports dont become a thing).</p>

<p>Are you going to take one every six months forever? That's what we are heading for. Try and bribe a doctor to say they gave to you. I don't know what to tell you about international travel your sort of screwed their. You mean you just flat out can't travel? But this vaccine will poison you not worth it. Your human rights will be taken away from you again soon enough even if you take the vaccine. They are already setting it up. I think it is pretty much a done deal.</p>

        <p>My problem is that the UK government clearly states that they don't know if you can spread or get it with the vaccine. So what's the point in getting the vaccine if I'm young and healthy?
They are proposing something extreme that has killed so few.
The whole "died within 28 days of a positive test" has massively padded the numbers.</p>

        <p>That's not even the worse part. They can't even prove it exists. So how they hell can they vaccinate you against a disease they can't even prove exists. It "minimizes symptoms" apparently but they still want you following all the old regulations. Its total bullshit. The point is sterilization and/or killing off the "eaters". The lockdown has killed more people then covid even if you believe the bloated numbers.</p>

        <p>Real funny good luck with your black market with the new digital currency they are going to be pushing out. What are you going to pay the mules in? Bitcoin? That will probably crash soon and they'll use that as an excuse to get rid of crypto all together under the name of your protection.</p>

        <p>I disagree, it's like me crashing your car, simply by writing numbers on slips of paper, it doesn't work that way. Sure, a group of sheep might think your car is now worthless, but does that really matter to you, when you can still drive it and use it exactly as it was intended to be used? </p>
<p>More people are realizing what's going on, more people are considered criminals or terrorists in the eyes of the totalitarian state. We already have a massive black market today. It's not just gonna disappear because it can no longer use a government issued currency, fact is that anything can and will be used as currency on the black market.</p>
<p>Consider this, what would you expect from a currency on the black market? name a few important properties, beside the obvious that no government should be able to control it. Now also consider that if they did ban cryptocurrency it's exchange prices to fiat would temporary fall and then stabilize, as it would only be traded on the black market, this has already happened in third word countries with hyperinflation. </p>
<p>You're assuming that you can't disobey government orders in the future, of course you can, just just have to avoid getting caught. I'm fully aware that I might have to clean my house using a broom, because modern vacuum cleaners spy on you, I'm aware that I'll be forced to use a wooden stove, because modern stoves spy on you, and electricity might be limited to "good citizens" only. Trading on the black market bets being poor and miserable nay day.</p>

<p>Interesting ideas. But I believe the government is going to come out with some digital currency soon they will be able to track everything with it and you can't exchange it with crypto currency at all. Basically cypto is useless if you can't exchange it for commonly accepted currency. You have to be able to exchange money for goods and services or else the currency is useless. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>

        <p>Exchanges happens on the black market all the time, theoretically speaking you're right. If everyone for some reason decides to pull down their pant's and obey every single order from the totalitarian government, I guess I'll be alone off grid with nobody to do business with.</p>
<p>The government could easily make their own crypto, with master keys, infinite supply and mass surveillance, anyone could easily do that. Question is, will people really fall for that? Why would you get government currency  when there's real cryptocurrency out there, not controlled by any government. </p>
<p>Regarding exchanges, it seem you're already deeply invested in the government systems, fractional reserve banking and so on. I'm not here to judge but maybe it's time to prepare for a potentially simpler life? If you're rich today the government could easily make you poor if you don't obey and don't use any alternative stores of value, like crypto, like gold &amp; silver, ammo or canned food.</p>
<p>If we truly end up with no currency on the black market, we'll just go back to direct trading. If I have chickens, I can trade eggs, feathers and chicken meat for pork with my neighbor who has pigs but no chickens. Someone might have carrots and potatoes (easily to store underground up to a year without refrigerator). Oil is available underground on my own land, that's free energy, just have to pump it up and refine it.</p>

        <p>But you can't get goods off the system to exchange them. You'll have to get someone on the system to basically do it for free and at great risk to themselves. Where do you expect to get food and good from?</p>
<p>Yes, people are gullible just call it cyber dollars call it secure and throw in a hundred dollar bonus for signing up and they are good to go. If the government illegalized the conversion of cryto to US dollar it would crash or am I wrong?</p>
<p>Everyone is deeply involved in this scam including just about every other country. Believe me I am stocked in those terms. I have silver and monero</p>
<p>You seem smart about economics but you don't understand how communist governments work they will do everything in their power to crush independence. I mean that if you have livestock and plants they will confiscate it along with your land (goodbye oil) and put you on a watchlist then give you a small scrap of it if you are lucky and grovel.  You are making the presumption the government will play by the rules. Look up and communist government they always go after the food to cripple to the people.</p>

        <p>There's always someone willing to take the risk, not for free, it's gonna cost, but there will be people. Just like it is today.</p>
<p>You're absolutely right about the sheep, wouldn't surprise me if 99% of the population just pull down their pants and bend over for their $100 check in the new digital government currency. But some people won't and they'll have to do their shopping on the black market.</p>
<p>Crypto has crashed multiple times throughout it's history, it recovers, that's the fine thing about market value. Supply and demand dictates the price, just like gold. Also, if the government runs their social credit system on any of the existing blockchains then there's no particular threat against that chain, there won't be any attempts to shut it down and if they try to add tools of oppression to the protocol they'll just end up with a centralized fork, that could be taken down.</p>
<p>&rt; Everyone is deeply involved in this scam including just about every other country. Believe me I am stocked in those terms. I have silver and monero</p>
<p>Correct, and a very good start. Got Monero and silver too, beside food and ammo. I'm aware about commies trying to crush independence, I might underestimate them a bit, but I've seen how they operate. They're against all kinds of independence.</p>
<p>They will certainly come and try to take my land and my food at some point, when that happens I got nothing to lose anyway. Better eliminate as many of them as possible. Maybe they stay away if they think there's covid in the village, people working for the government will certainly be afraid too.</p>

&rt;Yes, people are gullible just call it cyber dollars call it s</p>
<p>But what will you offer them? You and I will have nothing to offer them and I doubt anyone with any sort integrity will be apart of this new system.</p>
<p>Anal swabs are being used now to test for covid apparently. Again you'll have to get good off the new system somehow to put them on the black market. The black market isn't magic.</p>
<p>But crypto like money is only as valuable as the goods it buys if the new system won't let you convert crypto into its currency or accept crypto as a value form of payment then it is just numbers on a screen. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Communist leaders always have this god complex and they always build their throne on the corpses of everyone who isn't them. It's the devil's religion.</p>
<p>That's easier to say then do. The reality is they bust into your house at night and arrest you and take you to a "enlightenment camp" to starve to death under hard labor and probably torture. That's where we are heading I believe in a few short years. The people in government knows covid is a scam they helped start it. Afraid of what? They aren't risking their lives only the "just following order" morons are.</p>
