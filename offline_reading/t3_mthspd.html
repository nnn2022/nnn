    <strong>No Matter How Much Money You Have, We Are All On The Same Boat. This "Virus" Truly Proved That, Nothing is in Our Hands or Control.</strong>
    <p><p>For clarification, I live in Ontario. We have 1 of the craziest restrictions and lockdowns in the world. Literally everything is closed. Parks, Gyms, Places of worship, everything they deem non essential, dine in and the list goes on and on. There is literally NOTHING to do. And F online classes. Most of our degrees in this economy won't mean shi anymore. And sadly, it's only going to get worse and everything is going according to their (elite) plan, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/leaked-document-canada">according to this leak</a></p>
<p>On Friday, there was a huge assembly at the Mosque for Friday prayers, and I lead prayers there so I know a lot of important people in the community. So, 1 of the richest man in My area comes up to Me and says "Pray for Me, we are screwed." And mind you not this person owns many restaurants and businesses and has a net worth of easily 30 million plus. </p>
<p>He was telling Me that (Based guy and one of Us), no matter how much money you have, it doesn't matter anymore. We are all on the same boat. We can't go anywhere, can't do anything, and have to submit to this tyranny and have all these restrictions. And he told Me, "Value your freedom, because that money cannot buy." And this hit Me very hard. He's a wise guy, and very down to earth even while being so wealthy. How true?</p>
<p>While he may be rich, even he cannot do anything. There is literally NOTHING to do. Freedom over everything. F money, no matter how rich and based you are, money can't save you anymore. The truly powerful and in control are the elite. Which are the politicians, people in media, bankers, NWO people, and what not. These people are truly in control.</p>
<p>No matter how much money you have or anything, it doesn't matter anymore. We are all on the same boat.</p></p>

        <p>This was before the announcement. Nobody knew that Ontario will have even bigger restrictions. 25% capacity was allowed at places of worship. Now, all that is GONE.</p>

        <p>The money comment is true, up to a point. When you own 6.6 billion acres of land like Liz, or have an estimated combined net worth of 1 QUADRILLION US like the Roths and Rocks, the 'We're all in this together " mantra doesn't apply.</p>

        <p>This whole shit show can stop right now, if everybody says no more and takes off the stupid mask, opens their businesses, refuses the vaccines and we all stand together. They can only achieve this with consent and compliance, don't give it and the house of cards falls down.</p>
