        <p>These people are the real selfish people. They will defend their delusions until death and their main defense is appeal to authority. Their morals are dependent on the state and will do anything to get ahead if it's socially acceptable. Make no mistake, these people are dormant authoritarians. If they were born into the right family they would be ruling you. They will never wake up because their identity is ultimately dependent on people above them. Like how most bullies are victims of bullying themselves, they build this identity that is both self serving and appeals to the majority (because authority dictates the majority). They have no backbone and can be turned into monsters.</p>

        <p>I believe it's much more complex than that. Authoritarianism isn't usually a dormant trait, most that exert it are often quite open about it. The problem comes with identifying those that are controlled by virtue of their positions, versus those that achieved those positions for the sole purpose of exerting the authoritarian impulse. As for the masses.. IQ plays a large role in ones ability to identify when you are being manipulated and sadly, at least half of the population of the earth does not possess that skill. The appeal to authority is simply a survival instinct much in the way a pack of wolves will delegate to the alpha, but if the alpha were to ever show weakness it'll be eaten alive. Thus is the balance of controlling through psychology.</p>

        <p>Sad but true... These people will give up anyone and everyone to "survive". They have vastly underestimated the resolve of anyone with half a brain.</p>

        <p>Its easy to point fingers and say everybody else is stupid/ brainwashed but from the other side they see the same thing.</p>
<p>One side sees some brainwashed folk believing corperate and government propaganda, the other side sees some brainwashed folk believing misinformation and absurd theories that have been proven wrong countless times.</p>
<p>How would you convince either side that they are the brainwashed ones without the "butt of the rifle"? This would be either masses of people having long lasting side effects of the vaccine or you or a relative getting the virus and it hitting harder than you thought. </p>
<p>Ive seen a lot of people with an "us vs them" mentality, the "rich vs poor" or the "government and firms vs us, the people" with both sides just accusing each other of beeing brainwashed and stupid. And it fucking sucks.</p>
<p>I hope that these people on both sides are just a very vocal minority and that most people are open to question new information even if its supporting their current view of the situation. </p>
<p>But i guess thats hard to hard to prove because then the awnsers would also be mostly by the vocal minority...</p>
