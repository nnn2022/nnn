    <strong>Got aggressively kicked out from a shop for putting my mask on ‘too late’</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Cumbria, UK. Went into Asda, and straight away I’m being yelled at by the security guard to put my mask on. So I put in on a few steps later. She called the manager, took my shopping off me, threatened me with the coppers, and banned me &amp; my friend (who was outside the shop) forever, saying that we’ll get a £200 fine if we come back. All because I have an ‘attitude’ and didn’t put the fucking mask on straight away. My buses have been cancelled so that a bus 15 mins away from my house comes every 30 mins and the other one every hour, as if I wasn’t cut off from the city bad enough as it is. I’m beyond pissed. Apparently Boris wants to extend the lockdown another 6 months. What utter bullshit.</p></p>
