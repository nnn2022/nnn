    <strong>Were the Delta and Delta Plus variants created by the vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm asking this, because vaccinated people actually have a higher mortality rate from the Delta variant (and presumably, the Delta Plus variant too).</p>
<p>So, I think this is a sign that these variants could have been created by the vaccines. Vaccines that are ineffective in stopping a virus only puts pressure on them to mutate (just like the Marek's Disease vaccine). Though these variants don't seem to be any more deadly (unless you're vaccinated), we could eventually get a variant that is very deadly if we were to keep using the vaccines. Just like what people like Geert Vanden Bossche warned about. Maybe that won't happen, but I'm scared that it would.</p>
<p>There's many reasons to avoid these vaccines, but this is quite possibly the biggest reason.</p></p>

        <p>I am far from an expert and haven't really been following the whole variant thing but my gut feeling here is that this is a bioweapon that was created through gain of function research that we funded and it got out by mistake. I don't think they intended for it to have escaped like it did but it feels so engineered to me, like it's meant to do this to create as much destruction as possible. Like it's designed to fuck with us and disrupt society as much as possible and wipe out large segments of the population. I was skeptical of the whole depopulation agenda but now it seems very possible. </p>
<p>At first I thought all of those fringe scientists who were saying people who are vaccinated will be in trouble when they encounter another corona type virus were exaggerating and being sensationalistic but now it seems like it's actually happening. The whole cytokine storm thing is a nightmare and I am now genuinely worried about people who are vaccinated. I'm super concerned of them blaming people like me who refuse the vax and convincing themselves that I am the reason for new deaths. I think a lot of them are going to be very angry and confused and lash out at us. I believe that this too was intended. I recently watched a brother Bugnolo video that terrified the life out of me. It was about this sort of thing. I don't think of that all of what he's saying is going to come true but I do think that a modified version of what this guy is saying probably will come true and it is a horror show.</p>
<p>This is a new way of thinking for me, I've never been a person who connected the dots like this before and saw beneath a certain level. But I'm now realizing the depth of evil out there. For most people it's too horrifying and painful to even entertain the idea that there is something very Sinister going on. Right now though there are more and more people are starting to see this. Part of me thinks the variants are complete bullshit and a control mechanism. I think some of them are that and they're not real but I think some are real and the real ones are going to be very damaging to people who think they are well protected.</p>
<p>I think people also need to not lose sight of the fact that this virus is only part of the bigger picture. There is way more going on here than this. This is all part of a bigger agenda. It has been co-opted and integrated into the bigger plan for us. False flags and all that.</p>

        <p>Viruses go through many mutations. Viruses mutate to survive, so this is factually inevitable for any virus.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s either just another mutation of SARS-corona 2 (caused by peopleâ€™s natural immunity and the virus changing to attach again, the vaccines could also cause this reaction) or itâ€™s the other theory that the variants are a myth and people with flu symptoms are getting in inappropriately diagnosed. </p>
<p>From what Iâ€™ve read, the Delta variant is more in-line with flu symptoms and easier to diagnose than the Covid 19 major threat. Itâ€™s hard to find a number on how accurate PCR testing is, but it has been known to take multiple tests to confirm someone has the virus (or variant).</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not educated in any of this and Iâ€™m not trying to pass off my comment as education. These are just things Iâ€™ve read.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the Delta variant's main symptoms seem to be a headache, sore throat and runny nose. Nothing more than what you can get from the common cold or flu. Interestingly enough, loss of taste and smell are said to be much rarer with this variant too.</p>
<p>So, if anything, the Delta variant is less deadly, not more.</p>

        <p>According to Dr. Bossche, a mass covid vaccine rollout makes conditions optimal for highly infectious variants like Delta to emerge and spread. Since our vaccines cannot halt transmission, these variants will soon evolve into vaccine-resistant variants which are specialized to use sub-optimal vaccinal antibodies to give your immune system the slip, escaping immune pressure. Thus vaccine-resistant variants will make all previous covid strains look like childâ€™s play (which they are) and cause mass death/morbidity mostly in vaccinated people. To the rest of us, these variants wonâ€™t necessarily be any more deadly than the Wuhan strain (though covid is inherently more dangerous when it runs rampant, due to the higher probability of getting infected in the vulnerable few weeks after clearing an asymptomatic infection while you have sub-optimal antibodies).</p>
<p>This is all a rather unique viewpoint/warning from Bossche, but more and more signs emerge each day to corroborate it. As a student of biology who has read/heard much of Bosscheâ€™s work, Iâ€™m 99% sure it will come to pass. When itâ€™s obvious that vaccinated people are dying <em>en masse</em>, the devils (whose schemes may be dashed by this emergence) will try to blame unvaccinated people, and we must remind everyone that itâ€™s nonsensical that the virus would evolve &amp; specialize in response to a selective pressure it doesnâ€™t experience in unvaccinated bodies; that the far simpler explanation is that the vaccines held us back from herd immunity.</p>
<p>We live in profoundly evil times, but these will soon come to a close, if God wills.</p>

        <p>One of the strategies of manipulation of the masses involves the creation of an external enemy, in this case an invisible enemy.
Once you have created this external enemy you can make the masses believe what you want.</p>
<p>If it hasn't worked in the past years, it's because they didn't have the weapon of social media, which is an ideological carpet that stretches from West to East leveling the perception of the masses.</p>
