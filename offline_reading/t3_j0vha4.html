    <strong>Propaganda Is The Executive Arm Of The Invisible Government</strong>
    <p><p>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits, opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country-- Edward Bernays.</p>
<p>The deep state over reached and exposed themselves... I believe that by December the whole world, even the biggest sheep of them all will have heard and read into the truth of the hoax. The game is over for the covid hoax, the genie is out of the bottle.</p>
<p>What happens going forward when the hoax unravels intensively within the next few months? Every advanced economy except the US is headed into lockdown 2.0, but vast numbers of people are realizing more by the day the truth and massive pushback are starting across the world. </p>
<p>Will the deep state order governments to fall back or go ahead with lockdown 2.0 until revolt happens and the boot licking politicians are forced to stop the lockdowns.</p></p>
