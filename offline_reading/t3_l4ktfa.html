    <strong>Where have the "civil rights organizations" been? Your silence has cost us – and now, it has cost you.</strong>
    <p><p>Earlier in the pandemic, I tried to find out if civil rights organizations existed in my area. Local, national, whatever. I imagined donating to them, or even leaving them money in my will – because it seems to me we're going to need protection from government even more in the future.</p>
<p>But they were almost completely silent. I never saw anything about them in the media, I never heard about them bringing a case against the government, I never heard about them standing up for the little guy, and I saw next to nothing posted about them, or by them, in the "policy skeptic" subs or anywhere else.</p>
<p>So, I say to you, C.R.O.'s: you lost my money and my support, forever, by fucking off and failing to try to protect our civil rights. Now, I will never donate to you. If I'm wrong, show me what you did in the last 10 months. If I had heard of you being active during that time, I would have contributed. (The Canadian Civil Liberties Association is "monitoring" and producing "reports". Well, isn't that something!)</p>
<p>I thought you were the heroes, but now it looks like you're as afraid of government, or of controversy in a time of group-think, as everyone else.</p>
<p>(Forgive me for not posting this to r/LockdownSkepticism, because for months I've just assumed whatever I have to say will be "not quite good enough" there since that's what happened each time I posted.)</p></p>
