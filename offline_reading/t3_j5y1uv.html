    <strong>Melbourne Women Arrested At Beach For Travelling Outside Her Permitted 5 KM!</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/outdoors/melbourne-beach-arrests-daniel-andrews-threatens-to-extend-5km-rule-as-woman-arrested-at-altona/news-story/58e6642a9ab8a3b7472bb465405ea936">https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/home/outdoors/melbourne-beach-arrests-daniel-andrews-threatens-to-extend-5km-rule-as-woman-arrested-at-altona/news-story/58e6642a9ab8a3b7472bb465405ea936</a> </p>
<p>Victoria‚Äôs chief health officer has not ruled out an extension of Melbourne‚Äôs controversial 5km radius rule, saying ‚Äúthere are absolutely health reasons to keep it‚Äù.  </p>
<p>On Sunday police at an Altona beach were hit with an onslaught of  abuse during a dramatic arrest of a woman for breaching the covid hoax restrictions. The angry mob also claimed police pushed a pregnant woman as they were trying to deal with another woman who had failed to provide her name and address.</p>
<p>Police said they were conducting proactive patrols at Altona Beach on Saturday evening when they came across a group not wearing face masks about 6.15pm. A police spokeswoman said the group became aggressive towards officers when approached and a woman was arrested for refusing to provide her details.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOnce her identity was established (she was) found to be in breach of the chief health officer directions by travelling more than 5km from her home,‚Äù the spokeswoman said.  A patch of blood soaked sand can also be seen in the video as the woman was lifted up and taken away.</p></p>

        <p>Living here rn </p>
<p>When you add the fact china is deep into our state governments ass you start to learn where this authoritarian towards anti-government people comes from </p>
<p>But the fact the 5km might change to 10km is still annoying 
Terrible for the economy and mental health, fuck these unelected so called health officer who Arnt driven by health but scumbag politicians </p>
<p>Sorry if I came abit aggresiveüíÄüíÄ but I'm so sick of living here in this dictatorship with a dictator who's public said people who insist on human rights are selfish and dangerous, and seeing  the destruction of this state that I've been living for 18 years is going to shit</p>

        <p>The great reset and depopulation has nothing to do with china... The deep state are all eugenics that want to badly depopulate the world, the creator of cnn ted turner, soros, gates, richard rockefeller, klaus schwab and other sick fucks who have in their heads they absolutely need to depopulate the world going forward.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/</a> </p>
<p>What does china have to do with spreading communism in advanced economies and pushing depopulation through 1 child policies and vaccines? I feel like non educated people and astroturfers are trying to deflect the blame of the covid hoax from the deep state to china. </p>
<p>Why is it all the left leaning politicians across the world that are enacting this Orwellian non sense? Fuck off with your china bullshit... andrews is owned by the eugenics, not winnie and the cpp</p>

        <p>Yea true, I was gonna bring that up, 
He's 110% part of those things, but with China I think with the part of the great reset china was kinda a testing ground hence why now Victoria is following he Chinese model</p>
<p>But I kinda brought up china cause Andrews is the politician in Australia who's the closest with china and talks about how he wants Victoria to be the gate way and how he has CCP trained advisors </p>
<p>But yea I do agree it's more leaning towards UN, deep state operations then china</p>
