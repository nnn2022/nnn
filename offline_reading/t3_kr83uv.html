    <strong>How has this last year changed your personality?</strong>
    <p><p>For me, it made me into even more of a sarcastic asshole than before, increased my distrust in people in general (even though I’m still very much a “people person”, I’m more cautious about actually sharing my views in real life now) and completely obliterated my trust in the government and what I thought were my political views. </p>
<p>It also gave me an entirely new level of appreciation for the people I do love and trust, and made me more comfortable engaging with strangers online (I did so before but that was more hobby-related than talking about real world issues, expressing controversial opinions and getting into debates and arguments.)</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say I’m finding a silver lining in the “new normal”, because it’s all shit, but I did learn a lot about how awful people can be, as well as my own capacity to not give a fuck what they think. And that can be useful in the future.</p>
<p>Also I want to give a shoutout to everyone in this sub, even those of you I’ve disagreed or argued with, because I really don’t know how I would have survived without it.</p>
<p>If you feel so inclined, please share! :)</p></p>

        <p>Definitely for the worse. I have an extremely short fuse anymore and have random bouts of extreme anger, sometimes connected to the situation we’re all in specifically and sometimes seemingly for no reason. I don’t trust many people anymore and am no longer as friendly and outgoing when out in public. When I do find someone whose views align with mine it’s great but for the most part I view every single person I don’t know skeptically and with distrust and anger, and I assume for most of them they’re pro all this shit and happy to go along with it. It’s not good, I used to be quite friendly and happy but not anymore. I do have a greater appreciation for my family and friends who think the same as I do with all this and won’t support it, but that’s about the only positive.</p>

        <p>This is the work of the doom messaging and the masks. We all see each other as threats. Governments love it. I want to be open and smile and chat, but I also worry someone may turn on me. So I'm contributing to the problem. I try not to, but it's hard.</p>

        <p>Im with you on this...this year has absolutely been the worst of my life, im fucking miserable. Ive been noticing it a lot lately and that likely means others have noticed it a while ago. It sucks because i was in a very good place with family, friends and work before this bull shit. I feel like my life was taken away and im being told from every angle all the things i cant do anymore. Not that i was a world traveling, avid partier living it up every night, hell i thought i had social anxiety to begin with, nothing like this year. Everyone is a threat now, how can i feel comfortable with everyone hiding?</p>

        <p>hey. I just want to say I get it. But I think it's time to take back control and just do as you want. No one will punish you if they don't know. And no one will any way! Not sure where you are but in the UK it's all empty threats. No one can police anyone. So do as you wish and you will meet the right people and feel much happier!</p>

        <p>For me it's made me realise that other people are unreliable. A Holocaust survivor actually said this. I read an interview and she said that the experience made her realise how quickly people can turn. Well, I always kind of knew this on an intellectual level, but this experience has made me realise how easily people can turn against each other and revert to their base instincts. It doesn't matter it's coronavirus. It could be anything. Now it's happened, I can't unsee it and it's made me want to fly to a tiny island and never come back (to the UK).</p>

        <p>I am a lot more reserved around people.  It's difficult to talk to them or look them in the eyes.  Because of a few bad experiences this year I get afraid they will just start yelling at me without warning.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year I had a job that involved a lot of interactions with people, and I loved it.  Now I can't imagine approaching someone to introduce myself or ask if I can help them.</p>
<p>I feel frustrated because I had worked so hard during the last decade to get to that point from a starting place of being so shy I couldn't even order food for myself  without feeling sick.</p>

        <p>i was already pretty skeptical of the media and government before this for a while, so this last year was very much like watching reruns as far as trust in institutions goes. </p>
<p>what i was not ready for was all the snitching on fellow neighbors for partying or having over one too many guests. you're supposed to look out for neighbors especially so that when you have your own little gathering or you're up to something a little extra legal or need someone to look after your house, you don't have to worry because you know you have an ally on your side. or at the very least keep your disagreement between yourselves as neighbors. </p>
<p>on the other side though i have developed a deep, deep appreciation for things holding society together that we probably take for granted, namely truck drivers and people who deliver food to the grocery store and gas to the gas stations. because if those people just up and quit during the pandemic, i don't think many of us would have survived. i remember being at the grocery store one day last year and there not being any more of a type of meat and people getting real pissed off, and i was just thinking my god just imagine if they didn't have half this food here what the level of anger and hostility would be.</p>
<p>so i guess i'm a little more cynical now and rightfully so with what has happened.</p>

        <p>I’ve realized that I’m extremely fortunate to find the people close to me and that I value and respect the most all have a similar opinion about how ridiculous and damaging the reaction to a mild virus is. I’ve also realized how scared most people are in their day to day world and it makes me feel really bad for them.</p>

        <p>I've honestly just become more and more bitter. I don't really like it, but when every day is the same shit...</p>
<p>This has all gotten old, and I'm tired. I was already prone to depression before all this hit, but lately, there are some days that have become unbearable. We've started to make a world that I'm not sure is worth living in.</p>

        <p>I was always pretty chill to begin with, but it's definitely made me angrier and somewhat less risk-adverse too.</p>
<p>Not angry enough to randomly start snapping at people or risk taking enough to go out and snort blow of some goth chick's tits every night (DM me if this sounds interesting to you at all BTW), but noticeably so.</p>

        <p>Its revealed a dark reality about society.</p>
<p>Most people would love to commit violence against you for not obeying their every wish, but they will never admit this to themselves, much less you. Instead they vote in people who will authorize and/or commit violence against you on their behalf.</p>
<p>The test of a real man is to understand his propensity for violence and choose not to partake. </p>
<p>Behind every law is a man who will kidnap you and throw you in a cage, and if you resist arrest they may kill you. This is why its incredibly important to think through the ramifications of new laws.</p>
<p>The Cobra Effect is incredibly important too, being an example of the law of unintended consequences. Oftentimes policies that government introduce have the exact opposite results compared to their intentions.</p>

        <p>In addition to just being all around angrier and losing faith in a lot of people, I've realized that I depend waaaay too much on society. If supply chains get cut off, I wouldn't be able to support myself. That thought has me a little unsettled, so I am looking into living more independently--growing as much of my own food as I can, stocking up, preparing to live contently without electricity, etc.</p>
