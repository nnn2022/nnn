    <strong>Covid cases at this point DO.NOT.MATTER</strong>
    <p><p>i know im not saying anything new to all of you guys here. but anyone with a brain needs to realize at this point we are 16 months into this bullshit and its a never ending cycle unless you stop taking the MSM's word on it. The fact some countries that are viewed as Democratic are going back to lockdowns and masks is pretty telling.  Is it based on anything logical? of course not, its all about holding power over people and dividing among ourselves while rich people and their friends keep profiting.</p>
<p>At work We were talking and someone thought i was vaxxed and i said i wasnt. Of course they gave me that "oh well you could be at risk of getting it". then i mention how im not sick because i literally went to the doctors about a week ago. Then of course they gave me the old " well you could have it and not even know." i simply just said " theres no such thing as a nonsick-sick person. Asymptomatic spread is been debunked by so many doctors that arent paid by big pharma .</p>
<p>So when i still see almost 1 3/4 years where they still think that Cases are somehow a "checkmate" anti-vaxxers! is just pathetic. its been over a year and the deathrate hasnt changed one bit. thats kinda why the deathrate being less than .02% is never ever mentioned. </p></p>

        <p>They never did</p>
<p>Neither did hospitalization and deaths</p>
<p>Government doesn't give a shit about your health. It fucking sells you cigarettes. It has been cutting public health's budget for decades.</p>

        <p>Isn’t all of us dying from COVID or vaccinations bad for business? Edit: also all of us being locked down keeps us from feeding the capitalist machine?</p>

        <p>99% of 'cases' are sent home with no further medical treatment, other than 'isolate for 14 days' as with no symptoms, no diagnosis or treatment can be prescribed.</p>
<p>Oh, and on the way out, please fill in this contact form with all the people you have regular contact with, and we will add them to the case numbers as 'presumed cases' and further contribute to the 'spike/surge/skyrocket/uptick/soar/grim milestone'</p>

        <p>No one should be getting testing. If anyone gets a fever and cough, they should just be sensible like in 2018 and stay home and take a Tylenol.</p>
