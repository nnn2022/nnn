    <strong>Predictive Programming from ~2014-2015</strong>
    <p><p>So I’ve been rewatching a lot of old TV episodes, because you know.. lockdowns, and I’m noticing a lot of posters in the background on walls talking about ‘flu shots’ and ‘flu season’ and ‘get vaccinated’ and even just pictures of syringes. It’s weird. Or is it?</p>
<p>I first noticed it watching The Mindy Project, seasons 4-6, I think. And I didn’t think too much of it since the show takes place in a medical setting. But I kept pointing it out to my bf.</p>
<p>Most recently, I noticed it in season 6 of Community. Not a medical setting. Kind of weird.  Pointed this out to my bf and he said that I’m probably the only person who notices this stuff. </p>
<p>So just wondering what y’all are noticing when rewatching old shows. Anything similar? Any other thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>The propaganda machine has been shaming people for not getting the flu shot for awhile now. In 2018/2019, wasn’t there all those antivax memes going around?</p>

        <p>I'm only 20 but I think the last time I had it was in public school/grade school depending on where you're from. I'm normally fine with people doing what they want but even my friends have all been like you will face the consequences of your actions for not getting the vaccine when they roll out vaxpassports. It's such hivemind think my brain hurts.</p>

        <p>That’s so true. It never even registered for me to ever get a flu shot until around that time. I was going back to working in an office rather than at home, and figured I’d get it. Big mistake. A few months later I was sicker than I have ever been in my life. I didn’t eat for three days. </p>
<p>Looking back, I was definitely influenced by seeing/hearing about the flu shot and antivax propaganda more than usual.</p>

        <p>It's outside of the time frame that OP means, but, on the topic of predictive programming for the new abnormal? Three words: V for Vendetta.</p>
<p>- A plandemic is used by daddy government as an excuse to create a police state "for your own good"</p>
<p>- Said plandemic was actually the result of a bioweapon released by said government flunkies who made a figurative and literal killing</p>
<p>- US is literally on the verge of civil war after years of foreign interventionism and American "plague rats" are blamed for spreading the virus</p>
<p>And to top it all off: It's <em>set in 2020</em>. Yeah, I honestly wasn't sure about the whole "predictive programming" thing, but after last year and having this one pointed out to me, there's no doubt in my mind now.</p>

        <p>I'm currently replaying Life Is Strange, "get the flu shot" posters. And for all of the conspiracy theorist: there is a lot to discover about illuminati symbolism (I don't know about that, but it's undeniable).</p>
<p>Funny story a bit off topic. A few days ago I watched the epidemic episode of "little house on the prarie". When they had to quarantine Carolin says something along the lines of " it's been 10days keeping the children indoors. It can't go on like this." and I was screaming at the telly "ohhhhhh! 10days! Must be awful!!!! I'm sooooooo sorry for you!" XD</p>
