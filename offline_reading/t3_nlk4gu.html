    <strong>Woman I know has severe side effects from Pfizer- please watch out....</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>Person 1, who's already had covid: Severe vertigo, nausea, headache, fever, unable to go to work for a week +. </li>
<li>Person 2: fever, very bad headache, had to go home.</li>
<li>Person 3: Severe convulsions/involuntary spasms and muscle jerks, had to call the ambulance twice in one weekend after already having gone to the ER after having received her injection, unable to walk unassisted, severe headache, nausea, sensation of severe ''electric shocks'' shooting through her body, difficulty speaking and pronouncing words, still severely ill a week later and in a very worrisome state. They couldn't really find anything. </li>
</ul>
<p>With the third person, one of the things that makes it even more shocking and surreal, is that others recommended <em>drinking a broth.</em> A woman suffering from convulsions, spasms, unable to walk unassisted, difficulty speaking, feeling nauseous and truly sick, who had to call an ambulance twice in one weekend, gets suggested that she drinks a fucking broth, as though you're suggesting to a person suffering a terrifying heart attack that they need to eat an apple. Like, do people truly not see just how <em>alarming</em> this is?! </p>
<p>The third person's account, and she's not lying, was a huge ''holy shit''-moment to me. This thing is real. <em>Don't</em> take this injection! This is real, and this is terrifying. And the denial in other people is terrifying as well. (''get well soon!/ Sounds like you're dehydrated, drink a broth'') (as though the hospital wouldn't be able to figure that out, and as though severe dehydration immediately comes out of nowhere after taking an injection, as though it's completely random with no connection to this injection whatsoever) </p>
<p>Just don't don't don't.</p></p>

        <p>This might be a reference to bone broth, which <em>may</em> provide benefits by supplying nutrients and minerals that SAD is often lacking in.  But off the cuff I thing folks would have to start consuming before being vaccinated or getting sick, be it from a viral infection or vaccination.</p>

        <p>I've also heard some alarming side effects mentioned in an insanely nonchalant way, as if there is nothing unusual about it. Something along the lines of  "Oh I had the usual tiredness but other than that I'm fine, I've just had chills that don't go away ever since I got the shots" like whoa <strong>what?</strong> :D</p>

        <p>You know, in the last week or so, other types of posters are starting to reach out to NNN to express these and other censored sentiments. <strong>And they are joining the club!</strong> </p>
<p>When people have that "Holy Shit" moment described here and when other people around them witness for themselves how that plays out in reality, it's a GAME CHANGER! Doomers and the media can talk of the miniscule chances of side affects all they want but who, once they have seen the damage, is willing to even take those chances?</p>
<p>This is why we will win. No amount of propaganda can put all the genies back in the bottles that are opening everywhere. Eventually, and it has taken a lot longer than I suspected, the crushing devastation playing out for the world to see, in every neighborhood, company and church across the world will not be able to be suppressed.</p>
<p>I think this is why there was such a rush to push this thing. They knew it was deadly instantly for many people. For the rest, they have become the carriers of the "next pandemic" that Bill Gates so fondly chuckles over. They just needed a large minority of people to take the shot to perpetuate devistation on the vaxxed and un-vaxxed alike through mechanisms none of us are aware of.</p>

        <p>My Osteopath had similar symptoms to Person 3 and she is scared AF. Only got the jab because peer preassure was too much. </p>
<p>&rt;With the third person, one of the things that makes it even more shocking and surreal, is that others recommended drinking a broth. </p>
<p>After a whole year with long covid I can say with confidence that our medical system sucks and actually, drinking a rich in collagen drink it's good advice and closer to what our grandmas would recommend to us. Sadly, science has nothing to offer us besides dodgy jabs.</p>
