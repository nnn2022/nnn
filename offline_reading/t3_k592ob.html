    <strong>I was the first one to put on a mask in my town and they looked at me funny back in January.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm now the first one to take it off and they're still looking at me funny.  Literal sheep.. When the government said they didn't work, I didn't believe them. So I was wearing one until we had more data. Once they changed their tune i started getting hip to their jive, so I took it off.. Now i'm looked at funny again.</p></p>

        <p>Yep, I wore a mask and nitrile gloves everywhere back in March. Even sanitized everything on the front step before it came in the house. People thought we were nuts. </p>
<p>Now I don‚Äôt wear a mask, don‚Äôt sanitize anything, and am not getting the vaccine. People think we are nuts.</p>

        <p>I'm so glad to hear of others like this. I was a crazy person back in March. Wore a mask, sanitized groceries, washed hands incessantly, by the time of reopening in May I thought this was all bullshit. I have to wear a mask at work [I'm a hairstylist], and now that I currently have covid when I go back I'm telling all my clients I'm immune and that we don't need to do this anymore. Ultimately it is their decision but I am never wearing one out of work again now that I have immunity. Makes no sense.</p>

        <p>This is the main reason I don‚Äôt wear a mask. I had COVID from the last week of March into April. I still have antibodies. I‚Äôm not protecting myself or anyone else by wearing it, it would be purely theatrical to wear one at this point, and I don‚Äôt do things for show. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>Then someone realized they could lord this shit over people.</p>
<p>I was the same.  Me and my wife wore n95s all over and even made our cloth masks with pockets to hold hepa filters.</p>

        <p>yeah we did the same, wore a respirator mask and gloves, disinfected our feet and phones, etc, back in January when all we had to go on was China's experience (which was quite frankly horrifying and in retrospect was clearly a different strain), and we relaxed as more info came out about it and we saw that the government was using it as a power grab. Now we do as we always have, sanitising our hands when we get back into the car or back home and being careful with touching things lots of people touch like doorhandles and elevator buttons etc. Skepticism of the 'new normal' is no reason to throw out good caution cause this thing still sucks ass to have, but it's not gonna kill most people lol</p>

        <p>This was my husband too! He was wearing a mask as soon as the first cases popped up in Canada. I thought he was crazy, but then again I wasn't the one going to the grocery store and he thought it best only one member of the household leave.... 
Fast forward 8-9 months and he finally realized the data didn't back up mask wearing (or not for this virus anyway) and the fact that we're healthy means we're not spreading anything. He's now with me in going against the mask mandates. And let me tell you, the first time I saw his grinning face coming out of the grocery store amidst the sea of masked zombie sheep, I thought, I'm glad I have a real man for a husband. He literally doesn't care what anyone thinks (just like he didn't care when he was one of the only ones in an n95 back in Feb.)</p>

        <p>No you aren‚Äôt dumb, this entire sub is filled with morons. The reality of the situation is that the disease has a chance to kill. The chance might be low, but it‚Äôs still a chance. Wearing a mask requires no effort and doesn‚Äôt infringe in life in any meaningful way unless you suffer from some serious breathing issues, in which case you wouldn‚Äôt want to be out and about anyways. Even if you weren‚Äôt concerned about your own health, the least you could do is sacrifice the small effort it requires to put on a mask, so that the risk of you passing the disease to someone else is mitigated. Even if wearing a mask only helped the the prevention of the disease spreading marginally, it would still be worth it. Any effort we can expend in the hopes of literally saving lives is worth it. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs no different from wearing a seatbelt. We all know why it‚Äôs mandated. Do most people get in accidents? No. It‚Äôs there as a precaution in case you do. It can and has saved lives.</p>

        <p>I was thinking of this the other day. I remember distinctly shopping at Lowes in February and wearing a mask (N95), literally the only person with one on. Of course, I though the covid hoax was a real thing back then.</p>

        <p>When the bullshit headlines hit everyone was scared, understandably so due to the lies, they wore a mask as a precaution to such a deadly virus, now the educated know its far from that they won't wear one but the brainwashed automatons will, go figure</p>

        <p>Yup.  We saw this shit coming in January and started stocking up.  I was heavily pregnant and had the baby mid February...four days out of the hospital I went out for one last shopping trip before we didn‚Äôt go out for two months.  Everyone thought I was <em>nuts</em>.  Had strangers telling me to relax.  </p>
<p>China has orchestrated all of it.  Made it look like it had a 5% mortality rate to terrify us except that most people won‚Äôt believe that it actually isn‚Äôt deadly to the vast majority of people.  Now when I explain that or that the body of research is against masks and lockdown mandates I get looked at sideways again.</p>

        <p>This exact same thing happened to me. I was so "informed" and ahead of the curve that I was able to get N95 masks for my whole family and walk into CVS and get as much Nitrile exam gloves and sanitizer as I wanted. This was like after the first day it was announced that a "confirmed case" was in the US.</p>
<p>And I was the only person walking around with a mask and everyone looked at me like I was crazy. I literally had to beg my parents to wear masks into stores because they felt weird being the only ones doing it. And this is all because there was no data on the "virus" yet, so I was being as safe as possible. </p>
<p>Now my parents beg ME to wear masks, and now I get weird looks for being the only person not wearing a muzzle. </p>
<p>It's honestly frustrating being this informed.</p>
