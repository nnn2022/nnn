    <strong>Its a genius plan i have to admit, and i almost fell for it in the beginning.</strong>
    <p><p>Remember back in early 2020, all these videos blew up all over the internet of people in wuhan china dropping dead in the street?
The pure chaos in hospitals, people laying on the ground coughing up blood and seizing?
Hazmat people and Trucks driving through the streets spraying disinfectant everywhere?</p>
<p>Then the gears of the media get grinding, and the media starts pumping out stories that puts everyone in a panic talking about this mysterious deadly virus thats killing everyone.
Mass hysteria ensues and people start panicking and buying all the toilet paper and essentials etc. </p>
<p>Soon followed by that, big daddy govt pops in and starts imposing “temporary restrictions”. Shutting everything down, curfews, mask mandates etc. two weeks they said, remember?
A few weeks go by and all this is new, a lot of people were confused. Including me admittedly. These temporary restrictions soon began to become extended. Millions of people losing jobs, smaller businesses going out of business because of restrictions, meanwhile uncle sam imposes tighter restrictions and mega corporations are allowed to stay open and thrive. </p>
<p>Then the government, media and all these famous people take no time to immediately push narratives to accept this new normal, and to label people who aren’t complying as the bad guys and conspiracy theorists, and people who do comply as good guys.
They knew people would eat it up, it gives them a feeling like they are “doing their part” and a “good person”
Meanwhile Uncle sam swoops in playing hero by dropping in and giving us stimulus checks and promises for the vaccine etc.</p>
<p>Its genius really. The government and rich get more power and looks like the good guys while we get fucked. 
They knew people would eat it up and love to be able to virtue signal. 
<em>THIS PERSON = bad because they DON’T comply</em>
while giving people a  <em>ME = Good because i comply and shame those who don’t</em>.
Vaccine comes along, rinse and repeat what is stated above.</p>
<p>A year goes by and these “temporary restrictions” are still here and has gotten worse, and now were hearing about vaccine passports. The media has gotten so bad and just pumps out propaganda non stop. Everyone wearing masks and doing zoom calls in tv Commercials and children cartoons, the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Thankfully A lot of people have woke up, and some states are finally starting to lift restrictions and give freedoms back, but America is so damaged now and i fear this will only be the beginning of very very bad times unless more people wake up. </p>
<p>Even if this all goes away, at the end of the day the government and the rich got more powerful, meanwhile the middle and lower class got weaker. 
The wealth and power margin between the two grew <em>exponentially</em> in the last year.</p>
<p>I hope more people are finally waking up and realizing this was nothing but pure bullshit and a power grab.</p></p>
