    <strong>Had my first ‘debate’ with doomers today, honestly a miserable experience</strong>
    <p><p>I usually don’t like getting into online debates about anything, really.</p>
<p>But today I decided to tip my toes in r/unitedkingdom (even prior to Covid, that sub was just constant dooming from doomers).</p>
<p>Anyway, someone posted an article about a company saying that they’re going to sack anyone who doesn’t get vaccinated. Naturally, I thought this was an horrific idea. Naturally, they thought it was a fantastic idea.</p>
<p>It’s at this point I want to mention I’m not a conspiracy theorist, I don’t believe the vaccine is anything nefarious, I just don’t don’t think people who Covid wouldn’t kill in a million years need it... a bit like the flu jab.</p>
<p>I don’t believe this is all a nefarious government control plot. I honestly believe it’s just a case of the entire world overreacting and backing themselves into a corner and realising they can’t just back out of it without admitting they were wrong and taking responsibility for doing the most damage to humankind in peacetime. Governments generally don’t like that sort of publicity.</p>
<p>Having said that, I 100% believe the media have been entirely complicit in causing the hysteria for that sweet 💸💸💸</p>
<p>I just wanted to mention this to highlight I’m literally amongst the most ‘vanilla’ people on this sub - which makes my ‘debate’ with them even more astonishing.</p>
<p>Anyway, on the above mentioned post I said ‘I think effectively banning people from society without a vaccine is really dumb and this company is stupid’.</p>
<p>Then the replies and debating started. You honestly need to look at my post history to get the full grasp of it, it was astounding.</p>
<p>Getting told even questioning lockdown as an effective approach made me a ‘conspiracy nut’.</p>
<p>Getting told ‘don’t like your participation in society being dependent on a vaccine? Tough luck, kid 😎’</p>
<p>When I mentioned about how damaging lockdowns are someone replied, unironically, ‘have you seen the ICU bed occupancy rate?’....... TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC DAMAGE, UNEMPLOYMENT, SUICIDE, CANCER, SETTING THE THIRD WORLD’S REDUCTION IN POVERTY BACK 3 DECADES.................... and this is all worth it because of some ICU beds in A SINGLE FCKIN YEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER are full. I was genuinely taken a back. What planet are these people living on that some ICU beds being full means this is at all proportionate?!?!</p>
<p>Other replies included the usual dodging when you ask them why we never respond this way to flu, after all, they’re avoidable deaths aren’t they? I’ve still yet to have one admit they’ve killed a granny in previous years by doing literally any activity while feeling ill, sadly. That’s the logic we use now, right?</p>
<p>Getting told to follow the science.</p>
<p>Getting told ‘long Covid’ is the most unpredictable mystery of our time. For some reason, Covid is unlike any previous basic respiratory disease, I guess?</p>
<p>I just had to get this off my chest. These people depress me about the future. I feel like they are a minority though. I feel like if there was an anonymous ballot on ending lockdowns, we’d have a silent majority on our side. Like I said earlier too, r/unitedkingdom was a haven for doomers even before Covid and they absolutely represent a minority in the way they think. For a minute they riled me up but then I remembered these are the people in so much of a braindead bubble that they were convinced we’d be living in a Jeremy Corbyn landslide world before the last election. Their views literally don’t represent reality.</p></p>

        <p>I love how people who say 'follow the science' <em>don't</em> follow the science: they just read headlines.</p>
<p>Science says 'long Covid' is post-viral fatigue and inflammation: a well-known complication of most viral illnesses. Science says asymptomatic transmission is, as reported in the British Medical Journal, exceptionally rare. Science says re-infection is also, as reported by Public Health England and the BBC, incredibly rare. Every other headline has horror stories about one or the other, and what do they believe? The journals or the press? The press.</p>

        <p>I don’t want to sound mean but I think they’re worse than lost souls. I genuinely think a majority of them are absolute NEET losers who are so resentful that other people typically enjoy life that they want to drag everyone down to their level.</p>
<p>No one with a social life, friends, a good education/job wants any of this. Meanwhile, the Funko Pop collectors of Reddit cheer it on. Makes you wonder why.</p>

<p>i wish for that to be the case... but i think the people are being radicalized by the media &amp; hysteria, just like how terrorists are radicalised through the internet and recruited; the same thing is happening, they are becoming lunatics...</p>

        <p>Its' really really sad but:</p>
<p>I know I'm having an effect on people when they start to attack me personally.  Which is a weird realization really.</p>
<p>I think most people, intrinsically, like at the id level, struggle with "rationalizing the narrative".  They get defensive and hostile.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But socialization and constant, refined and weaponized media and subtle propaganda have  shown how incredibly powerful and compelling they are on our psyche and group mentality.  </p>

<p>This is actually is a prime example of well done propaganda. It actually was the elite jews of Britain that first declared war against Germany and a call to boycott anything German made.</p>

        <p>None, they all worked from home just fine.</p>
<p>None, though a few are still alive that might otherwise not be.</p>
<p>None, but existing agoraphobes and introverts have been having a great time.</p>
<p>None, toddlers have been learned the same thing you’ve failed to: that socializing is good but preventing the spread of disease is better, at least for a while.</p>

<p>I was encouraged to read your spirited, polite, and extremely sensible views. Unfortunately, you have to understand that a large percentage of the population can be made to believe absolutely anything. </p>
<p>Tomorrow, the government, or any other powerful group, could use the media to make them believe the complete opposite to what they believe today. They could tell them that Covid has mutated, and now it won't respond to vaccinations any more, so now no-one has to be vaccinated, and they'd be repeating that within 24 hours.</p>
<p>It is a grim prospect when you're confronted with these people, but you should have personal pride in the fact that you still have the intellectual and moral courage to step a few strides outside of the box.</p>
