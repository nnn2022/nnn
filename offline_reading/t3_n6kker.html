    <strong>They truly are evil.</strong>
    <p><p>During the Swine Flu thing, they tried anything they could to scare you off on TV and in the papers. </p>
<p>It was a complete failure. They had to throw away millions of vaccines.</p>
<p>Now they're back, but on steroids. You didn't take the shot last time, so they went as far as they could: they took control of social media with ubiquitous censorship. </p>
<p>They also took care to remove all your rights and freedoms, and ruined your life in every which way they could:</p>
<ul>
<li>By having you shut down your business and preventing you from making a living.</li>
<li>By preventing you from having any sort of fun (sports, nights out, etc). </li>
<li>By masking you and your children all day long. </li>
</ul>
<p>..and you're only getting back to normal (apparently so) if you take the vaccine this time around.</p></p>

        <p>More than that: </p>
<ul>
<li>The businesses that managed to survive the lock-downs have been destroyed in the race riots. The mega businesses (CostCo, Amazon,...) contribute to the authoritarians and made record profits. </li>
<li>If you had any sort of savings, inflation will wipe them out. Forcing dependence on welfare from the authoritarians. </li>
<li>The only options for young people to engage in matting behavior (aka meeting girls/boys) is at protests politically affiliated with the authoritarians. Increasing their support.</li>
<li>Social media censors any wrong-think against the authoritarian narrative. Reinforcing their propaganda.</li>
<li>Schools teach obedience and encourage children to report wrong-think that happens in their own homes.</li>
<li>Local police are being defunded and disbanded. A federal force, controlled by the authoritarians, will take their place.</li>

        <p>That shows if they just go for it confidently and pretend it is real, i.e. force everyone to shut down their businesses and wear masks, they make it real, because now it is so ubiquitous that it becomes a meme.</p>
<p>I also think the name matters. "Corona virus" just hits a sweet spot. Must have been quite the marketing decision.</p>
