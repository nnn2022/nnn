<li>Will the virus end?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t know. I know that most of the restrictions will end. I don’t know how long masks will be mandatory for (probably until 2022 in blue states). </p>
<p>I definitely think it won’t be until 2022 or 2023 when you can’t call in sick from work and be expected to take a covid test. </p>
<ol>
<li>Will theories happen?</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t think we will have the ones you listed. </p>
<p>I am more concerned that after it ends, we will still have nonsensical restrictions, like after 9/11 which was 20 years ago but we are still suffering under. </p>
<p>I am worried about more and more people being coerced and pressured to take the vaccine, whether through work requirements or “vaccine passports”. For the record, I got it and am not against it, but I am totally against being coerced or pressured into it. </p>
<p>I am worried about the dangerous precedent this has set. People now expect the government to solve the world’s problems through authoritarianism. </p>
<p>I worry about authoritarianism. </p>
<p>And I worry about the economic consequences. Most of us who grew up in the USA or first world countries haven’t experienced devastating economic chaos in our lifetimes. That can be both terrifying and deadly.</p>

        <p>agreed. word for word.</p>
<p>but also the push for a one world currency and “great reset” is very real.</p>
<p>and i won’t be getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>the whole 5g microchip “mark of the beast” shit is way too far for me lol.</p>
<p>my theory is that crazy stuff like that is made popular in the community to discredit the actual conspiracies.</p>

        <p>The virus isn't going to end any time soon.  It has worked far too well to get people cowering, accepting BS "guidance" and lockdown tyranny for it to be given up</p>
<p>Breakthrough cases from more severe and contagious variants will keep the pandemic story alive through the summer and set the stage for more rounds of restrictions next fall and winter.</p>
<p>As long as we accept the premise of scientific authority behind this, it will be perpetuated where our ability to come and go as we wish and live our lives will be the government's purview to mete out and deny as it sees fit.</p>

        <p>never any consequence for state scientists or NGO science like fucking IHME being wrong.   the best thing that could come of this is a big swing away from voting for democrats who have become neoliberal central planning authoritarianism junkies, and i honestly come from a liberal background and am still very classically liberal, as in, i’d like to do as i please, sir.</p>

        <p>Will end as soon as they mandate yearly Covid vazz for all children in schools. </p>
<p>And they will probably find some way to force adults as well.</p>

        <p>I think  a lot of climate policy got sidetracked due to a Trump presidency and they are going all out to get it back on track.</p>
<p>Now, instead of restricting travel, they are easing off of the restrictions.</p>
<p>Now, instead of creating a UBI (and limiting birth rights by making an application to have a child to be included in your UBI) we act like we haven't already got one but act like we do.</p>
<p>Now, instead of reducing driving, they have folks working from home.</p>
<p>To reduce consumption, they inflated the currency.</p>
<p>Everything they had planned on bringing in due to climate change policy, has been brought in via covid policy and will remain.</p>
<p>We have already seen one of the greatest decreases in the birthrate in a single year, and within 5 years, folks on UBI in Canada (and elsewhere) will be applying for the right to get an extra $5k or whatever by having a child and the line will be long and slow and they won't want to have one without get approval for funding. Part of this will be doing a fertility test and lo and behold, post-vaccine fertility rates will be significantly lower (must be Mother Earth telling us we are over-populating the planet, they'll say) and particularly so in some specific populations. In 20 years, the carbon value will far outstrip the UBI value for a child, and folks will avoid having them altogether.</p>
<p>It will be an encompassing squeeze of rights and increase of burden for bearing a child. And by 2100, they will have "defeated climate change" and reduced the world's population to 10%: the offspring of the elite and the few lesser beings to serve them.</p>
