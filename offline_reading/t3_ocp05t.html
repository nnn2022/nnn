        <p>Lol “the Fed” is short of the Federal Reserve it’s part of the federal government so I don’t know how it’s a “private company.” How is printing money a bad thing don’t the people need a standard to be able to trade goods and services.</p>

        <p>The Federal Reserve is not part of the government. You think it is just because of the name, which is exactly why they called it that. It's a private central bank. Instead of being ignorant and laughing at me out of ignorance, how about you do basic research before talking about something?</p>
<p>People used to HATE the bankers and literally killed them. America was founded on getting away from them and being free of their tyranny. So they had to use a bunch of PR to make sure people didn't realise they were taking over the U.S covertly. Every previous attempt was unsuccessful because they were too blatant. Now they own everything in America and half the world.</p>

        <p>Wow this maybe the dumbest think I have heard. It was established by Congress, it is the President of the US who appoints the board of governors. It is still called the “Federal Reserve Bank.” They can be audited at any moment so what you are saying is not hundred percent accurate. I wasn’t laughing before but I am laughing now lol.</p>

        <p>streets. education. all those things</p>
<p>sure, all of this is paid via taxes to a big portion. but so is the healthcare system (even in countries with private healthcare, not that they need to necessarily be included for the example ro be valid), and vaccines are just part of a health care system. a healthy population is much better for the economy than a sick one of course.</p>

        <p>Oh okay. Thanks... I don't think streets and schools make a population healthier, but I could definitely be wrong. Also, let's say that those in charge think that our planet is overpopulated. If that's the case, they would disagree that a healthy population is good for the environment... </p>
<p>Also,  two things, 1. This isn't a vaccine (meaning, it doesn't prevent or provide immunity for an illness). 2. I haven't seen the push for any gym, vitamins, or healthy lifestyles etc. In fact these things were actively discouraged.  If the goal was to create a healthy population, most countries have fallen short. Or have done the opposite.</p>

        <p>well in the long run it probably makes them healthier. but yeah i agree, they weren't an example for health stuff. i thought you wanted examples for free stuff that still benefits the government. if you want health specific examples... well, the health care system itself! in many places anyway</p>
<p>as for overpopulation... a healthy population would still be ideal, they should just reproduce less. if anything sick elderly people would be the goal, <em>assuming</em> the general public loses all their compassiom and wouldn't try to help them and spend time with them. big assumption imo</p>
<p>well it's still a vaccine, even if it doesn't give you complete immunity. the relevant part rn is that it efficiently reduces the spread, and <em>that</em> is the goal. a healthy <em>population</em> as a whole</p>
<p>how are any of the things you listed discouraged?? i'm curious, there's nothing like that where i'm from. most doctors would recommend all of that stuff here whenever i asked them</p>

        <p>Thanks for your response. Gyms are/were discouraged explicitly by their closings. That seems obvious. Vitamins are discouraged by the fact that anything other than the jabs are generally seen as ineffective, or even conspiracy theories. Lastly, by healthy lifestyles, I mean fitness and losing weight (in overweight and obese people). People have been told to stay at home, order takeout, etc. The current propaganda tends to avoid mentioning obesity as a leading factor in Covid deaths. </p>
<p>I know I didn't speak much to your comment. I wanted to answer your question while clarifying my point.</p>

        <p>oooh so you were only refering to the current covid situation. i see, i thought you meant generally. well yes, some less than ideal situations have happened because of that. but that's because compromises had to be made. even though there are negatives to it it is still the definition that minimizes health damage. sure, closing gyms stops people from working out, but the potential spread at this time faaar outweighed the short term damage of closing gyms (which is almost non-existent for such a short time anyway, short time being ~a year). same for healthy lifestyles (noone stopped anyone from just going for a run btw. if you're alone?? might be hard in big cities). as for vitamins, well, you're still encouraged to have a healthy diet. but the idea that they're a cure against a virus is just objectively false, so it's discouraged AS A CURE, not vitamins themself. the only diseases they can cure is... well, the ones caused by vitamin defficiency. </p>
<p>sure, all these things are good theoretically. but their small short-term positive simply did not justify the huge short-term negative caused by an uncontrolled spread. hence the decision. an unfortunate and annoying compromise, but one that prioritized the health of the population nontheless.</p>

        <p>Streets and schools absolutely do make a population economically healthier, what are you talking about? Roads enable everyone to work which generates literally everything, and schools are the only thing that can train people to do the jobs, again, generating everything.</p>
<p>If the elites thought the world was overpopulated, it would be BECAUSE the population wouldn't be able to be healthy and fed. The elites and people who favor depopulation in general believe in that because it will make the population healthier and happier, generally. So yes, they very much want a happy population - they are just potentially willing to put others rights in the way to get it.</p>
<p>Also, to counter your scientific definitions bullshit, find me ONE paper saying the vaccine doesn't prevent the disease? You're wrong. The definition of a vaccine literally has never been a guaranteed prevention.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate you haven't seen the "push" for more healthy lifestyle, you must live in America, where the only place that advertises that shit is the gym and the hospital. Nope, they were absolutely not discouraged, just going to stupid unnecessary locations outside. God you're so ridiculously out of reality it's sad.</p>

        <p>CPG Grey has a great video called rules for rulers.  Talks about how dictatorship and democracy is built by those in power and how those elites in power are tied to the 3 rules for rulers. One of rules is no man can rule alone if your resources come from your people you have to make them somewhat educated and somewhat healthy otherwise you wouldn’t have productive citizens making you money. But if your in a dictatorship they don’t need you to pay tax they just need you to work in the mines so they won’t invest anything into the people. </p>
<p>The point is people in power only care about maintaining that power and it’s just a coincidence that they give you a road and a school to go to because they want you to work and pay tax which will be more then the school or roads they have built for you.</p>

        <p>if you can convince the population, sure, that would make everyone healthier. it is however really expensive to make it easily available to everyone, has a lower short-term benefit and is also insanely inconvenient for the average citizen (aka people won't want to do it). these are all things you'd also have to consider, and factors that vary a lot between our discussion topic here and your examples.</p>

        <p>Just remember your position and what you pushed for. You might soon realise that nothing they are doing makes for a healthy population. At some point you’ll have to look around and accept they made everything worse. Let’s hope you aren’t too ignorant to admit you are wrong when there is overwhelming evidence that this jab is harming people. Take care.</p>

        <p>there already is evidence that it's not doing such a thing. so same to you, remember your position until... well, now. </p>
<p>sorry, i will side with science. always. and i have no reason to regret that. i am sorry that you do not, but don't act like you <em>know</em> what the future will be like. there's only one concept that can even slightly claim such a power, so let's not act like we two can precisely predict the future.</p>

<p>There is overwhelming evidence that the jab is harming young people who wouldn’t be harmed by Covid. Not sure how you sleep at night. Go wank over your god of science. I saw no science in your comment just religious brainwashing.</p>

        <p>i do not. "to side with science" means "to side with the side supported by science". example: there are 2 sides to the debate "do atoms exist?". one side says yes, one says  no. science supports one of these sides.</p>
<p>no, there is hardly any. there is evidence though that it doesn't do any harm. you know, also like almost every other vaccine in existence. an extremely old, often tested medical procedure. i am sorry you got brainwashed into thinking we need to rely on belief, which is why you think science is a religion. fortunately there is more to it, there are methods to figuring out actual truth. this has nothing to do with religion, so don't try to force it into this discussion just because you rely on it.</p>

        <p>I already used those methods to find out the truth in March 2020. My position is backed by science. Yours is backed by propaganda and paid shills. I get it, you disagree but trying to act like this is because you follow science instead of the fact you follow literally anything the media pushes for is kinda silly.</p>

        <p>no, you did not. did you get a medical education?? where are your months long double blinded studies with thousands of participants?? and how did you organize this all on your own?? but since you did it, which journal verified your results, and do you have a link?? i would be interested in reading what data analysis methods you applied??</p>
<p>mine is actually backed up by proper scientific studies. yours is not, sorry to inform you. i don't care what mainstream media says, and your hyperfixation really shows how much mainstream press controls you. you desperately try to dosagree with it, <em>no matter what</em> . even if they're correct. that is as biased as listenting to it, completely the same. something to consider.</p>

        <p>Can you answer my question about when you last held an opinion that went against what mainstream shills are pushing for? If you can’t think of anything wouldn’t that make you a corporate whore who can’t think for yourself?</p>
<p>Where are the ten year long independent studies that normally happen with a vaccine? How come mRNA technology has been trying to get approval for 15 years but never gets approved because all the health problems we are seeing now were know about before? </p>
<p>Look we’re not getting anywhere here, just know that if you don’t change your opinions in light of new information, you don’t really have any opinions of your own. Look around you, healthy people are being harmed.</p>
<p>I don’t need a medical education. I have a degree and understand how to consume information in a non biased way. I have thousands of years of medical history at my disposal. You follow a guy who lies about masks, I looked i to it myself before March and realised that masks do nothing and are more likely to cause infection. Just one example of many.</p>

        <p>yes, whenever science disagreed with mainstream media. can you think of anytime you didn't automatically try to disagree with experts, just so you can see yourself as a cool #independent "thinker"??</p>
<p>there was no problem getting approval with mrna technology?? the problem has been around for a really long time, and there were already vaccines developed with it that were extensively tested and shown to be safe. there just never was a <em>need</em> for a new mrna vaccine. for the ones before (done for rabies and flu for example iirc) we already bad better ones. now with covid there was finally a time to show off. and even the ones now were extensively tested, no idea where the incorrect myth comes from that they are any less safe than previous vaccines...?? </p>
<p>i am constantly adapting my opinion based on new information. the problem is that there simply IS no proper evidence supporting the covid vaccine hate, while there is overwhelming scientific consensus that it's safe and effective?? if you don’t change your opinions in light of new information, you don’t really have any opinions of your own. Look around you, noone is getting harmed and yet spread is stopped.</p>
<p>these thousand of years are disagreeing with you however. you are HIGHLY biased. want a prove?? the "guy" you refer to that i apparently follow?? i can't even begin to imagine who you could possibly refer to. i have zero idea. but you brought him out of nowhere and projected everything onto him and blamed him for our disagreement. you are so obsessed with him that your hate againat him overrides whatever scientific evidence there is. you don't want to think for yourself, you want to disagree with the general consensus. and the mask thing are factually wrong, there are lots of benefits mask have depending on the circumstances. higher infection rate however has never been observed but also makes zero sense. like, what even is your justification for this ridiculous claim. even ignoring all the actual <em>evidence</em> showing that they work great, what is even your logic behind this wild claim??</p>
<p>some people struggle with the idea that not everything is a big conspiracy. that they can't be heroes fighting against corruption. i am sorry you can't be a superhero. but that's just not the world is like. i am sorry you can't handle that. but that's no excuse to ignore all reason and logic.</p>

        <p>true, that would be good. these upsides wouldn't have outweighed the bigger downside from an uncontrolled spread however, which is why we decided against it. but those 2 things don't contradict each other anyway, there are tons of exercises available to almost everyone that you could do during the lockdowns, and eating at home is on average healthier than eating out anyway (assuming you actually cook of course).</p>

<p>There has been an entire population of seniors who had all activities and visits taken from them for over a year.  Isolation and inactivity kills seniors as surely as any virus.</p>
<p>Was it fair to <em>harm</em> these people, many of whom would never get sick from Covid, in the name of keeping them safe from Covid?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately public support for those policies has been built on top of flawed information.</p>
<p>People <em>vastly</em> over-estimate the danger of Covid.  In a recent Australian poll, people said that if you get the delta variant you have a 38% chance of dying. That was the average response.</p>
<p>Earlier polls from the US said the same thing.  People were <em>drastically</em> over-estimating the chance of death or hospitalization.</p>
<p>And why are they so wrong?  Because of how the media presents the story.</p>
<p>So these policies have been built on &rt;mis-informed&lt; consent.</p>
<p>Of course people are tolerant of these measures. It's because they wildly over-estimate the danger they are being saved from.</p>

        <p>some overestimate it. some underestimate it. there are both sides in reality. luckily the policies were built on the actual true data (and not the media), or at least the most correct one we could gather considering we were in the midst of it. so nothing here really changes my statement: we as a society chose the path where less people die, not the one where we don't interfere. as long as the """misinformation""" was still "more people die if we don't do anything", which is still true, all important infos correctly came across.</p>

<p>I think it's more accurate to say that the policies were built on &rt;models&lt;, made by specific scientists, that said "what could possibly happen in the future if we dont do X".</p>
<p>The models remain hypothetical.  And we have seen <em>many</em> models turn out to be wrong, havent we?</p>

<p>and even if, sure, it CAN be wrong. but it can also be right. and we still have to decide. so we go with the option that is MOST LIKELY correct. and that's what was done. noone can see into the future, so we have to use statistics and act on what's most likely, not unlikely.</p>

        <p>it seems you misunderstood then. what that meant is that it doesn't necessarily have the same biological impact on your specific body. you know, like the flu mortaltiy can vary from year to year. what people wanted to emphasize with "novel virus" is that it's not a previously commom strain of coronavirus, but a mutation. that however doesn't mean that they said it would behave differently from <em>any other spreadable diseases in human history</em> . because they always spread the same, roughly. they follow trends. when in the last year every day 20 new people got infected, then the next day it won't suddenly be 0, or 300000.</p>

        <p>there is no "if". the mortality of the flu varies from year to year, that already proves my statement.</p>
<p>i think you confuse short term and large term evolution here. regardless, to answer your question: because we have immune systems.</p>
<p>yes, they do that too. but those 2 things don't contradict each other. some mutations also are less deadly and spread less. those occur too. but for obvious reasons we talk less about them. evolution is not a singe one-way road, especially for smaller organisms. you're aware of that, right??</p>

        <p>No. From covid. Those people would have lived had it not been due to covid. </p>
<p>The beginning of every year statisticians calculate the number of deaths they expect to see under normal circumstances. They take that number and subtract it from how many people actually died at the end of the year and the final number is called "excess mortality" / "excess deaths"  / "mortality displacement". </p>
<p>From 2017 - 2020, the death rate was always under what they calculated to be the excess mortality threshold, meaning the excess mortality amount was basically zero. Except for a random spike in a single month in 2018, but I can't pretend I know what that's about. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">The CDC has a cool graph to illiterate this.</a> </p>
<p>From now since January 2020 though there have been a total estimated 500,000  excess deaths. </p>
<p>Even <em>if</em> doctors for some reason lied and wrote COVID as the cause of death for everyone, there are <strong>still</strong> those 500,000 excess deaths that are unexplainable. <em>Something</em> had to of caused that because those people would not have died under normal circumstances. If not COVID, then what?</p>

        <p>Some or most of the excess deaths can be explained by the effects of lockdowns, such as increase in alcohol and narcotics consumption, decrease in non-covid medical care, decrease in physical activity resulting in increase in cardio-vascular disease, increase in depression which also kills, increase in hypochondria resulting severe and widespread nocebo effect, and I am sure the list can be continued.</p>

        <p>Yes, SOME. But it's fairly easy to easy to find the death rate due to cardiovascular disease, suicide, etc. We have those numbers, but they do not add up to even close to the total of the excess deaths. If you take the difference of people dying from those things and compare it to the year before and subtract it from the excess deaths, there are still way more excess deaths left over.</p>

They take that number and subtract it from how many people actually died at the end of the year and the final number is called "excess mortality" / "excess deaths" / "mortality displacement". </p>
<p>And there is no "universal" way to calculate this.  So you are looking at specifically the CDCs estimation of Excess Death.</p>
<p>&rt;From now since January 2020 though there have been a total estimated 500,000 excess deaths. </p>
<p>Do you know how the CDC calculates excess deaths?</p>
<p>&rt;Even if doctors for some reason lied and wrote COVID as the cause of death for everyone, there are still those 500,000 excess deaths that are unexplainable.</p>
<p>You are acting like it's an objective number. Like there are 500k "unaccounted for bodies" and you say "Well how do you explain THESE then?"</p>
<p>But Excess Death has 2 components, right?</p>
<p>1 - How many deaths there were.</p>
<p>2 - How many deaths your favourite scientist says there should have been.</p>
<p>Which of those 2 numbers exists only in theory?</p>

<p>Well, yeah there's no universal way, but everyone who does calculation uses the same methods they've used in previous years. You're trying to compare one person's estimated death rate to another's and saying that means one of them is wrong. It's irrelevant whether one person came up with a different number. If there have been more deaths than they estimated, then there has an increase in excess deaths. Unless you can find a scientist that found there to be 0 excess deaths, then this is irrelevant.</p>
<p>... </p>
<p>&rt;Do you know how the CDC calculates excess deaths?</p>
<p>By subtracting the estimated deaths from the observed deaths. Just like every scientist. 
Did you mean to ask how they calculate estimated deaths?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;Which of those 2 numbers exists only in theory?</p>
<p>Both those numbers exist. The death rate trend doesn't just exponentially increase more than previous years without an outside force (hurricane, war, a pandemic). </p>
<p>If you find (using completely random numbers here) that there is an estimated 1,000 deaths per million per week then that will remain relatively true forever unless something influences it. If the deaths end up going from 1,000 to 5,000 then it's fair to say something extremely abnormal happened.</p>

<p>Calculating estimated deaths is a part of the process of calculating Excess Death, so I thought that was kind of self-explanatory.</p>
<p>&rt;Both those numbers exist. The death rate trend doesn't just exponentially increase more than previous years without an outside force (hurricane, war, a pandemic). </p>
<p>So you do know that the CDC admits that if they simply used a different modelling methodology, their excess death count would be different by 25%, right?</p>
<p>You might also be interested in the fact that when the CDC was reckoning death tolls, any region that reported that they had &rt;fewer&lt; deaths than normal was re-written to "normal", right?  As in any "negative value", lower than the expected deaths, was simply ignored and set to zero. </p>
<p>You might also be interested in the fact taht up until 2020, the CDC increased the expected death toll by 2% each year, to account for population growth.  However in 2020 they only increased it by 1.5%, leading to a smaller "expected death" total, which results in a larger "excess death" total.</p>
<p>There is a lot more going into the calculation of Excess Death than I think you are aware of.</p>

        <p>Today I worked with a 20 y.o. In the hospital that is pretty much dying due to complications with COVID. It’s incredibly sad to see. He has a trach, 6 chest tubes, CCRT, ecmo, rectal tube, Foley catheter , and a million other lines keeping him alive rn. On top of that he is jaundiced due to his liver failing and all of his toes are black from necrosis due to the medications they have been giving him to push his blood back to his body. I think people need to see how it affects other people’s lives to understand how serious it can be.</p>

During the height of the pandemic almost 2000 to 4000 people were dying a day in the US. That’s like having 911 happen every single day for a month, yet because the virus is something we can’t see with our naked eye, many people don’t believe it’s real.</p>

        <p>No, I’m a volunteer firefighter in an area where most of our calls are for extremely elderly people. So for the sake of those in my specific community I took it. And guess what, everyone should be able to make that decision for themselves. I fully support my friends that haven’t vaccinated and we all still hang out. I also support my friends that have. Because I’m a proud American that believes in individual liberties, unlike you apparently.</p>

        <p>I just believe in not being a brainwashed idiot who gives into fear-mongering. No I don’t have friends who took the vaccine. This kind of soft attitude is exactly how we ended up in this situation. The jab doesn’t help you not spread it. Why are you subbed here if you are going to ignore all the info we share? </p>
<p>You are more likely to get ill and infect others now not less, not to mention you gave into tyrannical peer pressure which makes this harder for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Fuck you. I’m not mad at dumb sheep, they can’t help it but people who claim to be awake but give in “for their own reasons” reserve a special place in hell for me.</p>

        <p>who are THEY killing???  you mean all the people with depression KILLING themselves???  &amp; sometimes one of aspects of much depression is putting the blame on others.  sometimes it's cause people cannot ask for help.  sometimes depression is caused by drugs.  there are many reasons for depression - but WEARING A MASK really ought not be a reason to kill oneself over.<br>
"THEY" are ruining people's lives?  - by closing a business? - then do another business.  are you sitting at home waiting for the gym to open?  buy yourself a bag of concrete &amp; make your own gym equipment.  give me YOUR argument for not being sensible</p>

        <p>You can block nhs phone number? I called them to opt out and they still contact me, I can’t block them because they have no number, caller just says “NHSvaccine”. So they can harass you and you can’t even get them to stop. Pretty sure that was illegal before 2020 but nobody gives a fuck about stuff like that anymore. </p>
<p>I had people come round my house. I told them where to stick it but I listened in as they went to other doors: how many other people live here? What is their name? Did they get the vaccine? When/which one? Or, why haven’t they got it yet? </p>
<p>I had to tell my housemates to tell them whatever they want about themselves but please don’t give any information out about me. I’m looking forward to doomers excusing people going door to door encouraging poor people to harm themselves. We just have to wait a bit longer. These people are going to be clearly ill soon, there will be no denying it.</p>

        <p>I think sugar isn't as bad when it's bundled up with a bunch of fiber. There might even be some other things in there to help deal with it. Two things related to fruit, though. I think the supply of them has become super abundant, and they've been bred to be more desirable to people, which means sweeter. If you're healthy and not overweight, you'll probably be okay eating a little fruit.</p>

        <p>After fact checking it’s closer to 97% (worldometers). With long covid effects around 5-10% and usually vary between 4/12 weeks with a few cases lasting longer (bbc). Don’t know where you get this 99.7% survival rate, it was most likely that the first couple of weeks.</p>

        <p>Obviously it is a personal decision and some people choose not to. </p>
<p>However, the benefit of vaccine-based herd immunity vs natural herd immunity is two-fold.</p>
<p>One, vaccine-based herd immunity would be largely asymptomatic, meaning fewer people would have health complications and die.</p>
<p>Two, it would be much faster and the virus would have less chance to evolve.</p>

        <p>Didn't we have lockdowns and were forced to wear masks because Covid is asymptomatic? So essentially natural herd immunity is also asymptomatic? Hear that? I need you to understand what I just said.</p>
<p>If we never locked down, we would have reached herd immunity a year ago.</p>

        <p>&rt;Did you take into account how many people would die until we reached a natural herd immunity?</p>
<p>Protect them.  We could have put an "Iron Ring" around them and let Covid spread through the general non-vulnerable population.  Everyone would develop robust natural immunity. You wouldnt have this weird staggered immunization and lockdowns creating regional variants.</p>
<p>And then once the vaccines had been developed, we could have given them to the vulnerable who need it requiring less $$ and less effort.</p>
<p>The pandemic would be entirely behind us.</p>
<p>But of course <em>that wasnt the point of all this</em>.  </p>
<p>"They" want the vaccines and the VaxxPass.  </p>
<p>So that was the only option given to us.  And then they used media to convince people that it was absolutely necessary and there was no other possible way.</p>

        <p>Quite the opposite, you need to read up on leaky vaccine syndrome. It allows dangerous variants to evolve, whereas natural immunity means no truly dangerous variant can spread far and they naturally evolve to become LESS dangerous over time.</p>

<p>It's true. Most people only feel the sniffles and such.</p>
<p>&rt;Soooo asymptomatic herd immunity. Which you are against if you are for lockdowns. You can't be for both</p>
<p>I'm not "for lockdowns" in the sense that I like them. But the idea is that if people stay apart (hence lockdowns) until they get the vaccine, then the fewest amount of people will die.</p>

        <p>I think we differ in that we are not on the same page with the virus spreading. I think life and the economy can continue on just fine with the virus even back in peak cases. </p>
<p>I say this as someone that was in NYC the entire time. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Almost everyone I know was sick in Dec/Jan way before we locked down or tested or even really heard of covid. I suspect this was covid going around. We all coughed for quite a while. It was spreading around and we didn't notice that it wasn't a cold. I've been sick similar to that many time in my 40+ years. Never in a million years would we have thought something was odd. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when testing was available and NYC hit the crazy high case counts I didn't notice anything. Stores were all open by this point and nobody seemed to be scared in practice. They would say they are scared but the people out and about simply bought their groceries, road the subway, laughed and conversed in those stupid outdoor enclosures that are no different than an indoor space. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I personally don't think young people which are our future needed to sacrifice for the elderly. Doesn't make sense. If you're young and scared of the virus then that's something we'd disagree on too, the young would have never been scared if the media hadn't told them to be. </p>
<p>Most young people must have figured that out by now from stories from friends. Too many futures were ruined, economies damages, children harmed. Doesn't add up to me and I always try to ask myself if I'm wrong. But I'm the big picture it doesn't add up.</p>

        <p>While I disagree with pretty much all of your opinions, I'm not going to try to convince you not to have them. I'm sure you've reached them after informing yourself. However, I would like to add two thoughts.</p>
<p>One, you're lucky not to know someone who has died from COVID. I know someone in their 20s who died about 6 months ago from it, and the same measures that would have protected the elderly would have protected her.</p>
<p>Two, during April of 2020 while you were anecdotally nonchalant, there were an average of just under 1000 deaths every single day from COVID in NYC alone. The average normally is about 150. It was those images of refrigerated trailers full of dead bodies, trench graves, and overfull hospitals that led to the whip-like response of many cities in locking down. </p>
<p>I hope you continue to ask yourself if you're wrong.</p>

        <p>Today I worked with a 20 y.o. In the hospital that is pretty much dying due to complications with COVID. It’s incredibly sad to see. He has a trach, 6 chest tubes, CCRT, ecmo, rectal tube, Foley catheter , and a million other lines keeping him alive rn. On top of that he is jaundiced due to his liver failing and all of his toes are black from necrosis due to the medications they have been giving him to push his blood back to his body. I think people need to see how it affects other people’s lives to understand how serious it can be.</p>

        <p>I mean, we'll get both, naturally. I explain in another comment but the short answer is fewer people die with vaccine immunity.</p>
