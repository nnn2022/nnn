    <strong>Getting Tested for Covid-19 -- only option is the long swab up your nose</strong>
    <p><p>I came down with something a couple weeks ago; first a sore throat, then a nagging cough. Besides feeling like crap (general malaise, I guess), I had no other symptoms. The cough became worse, though and I thought I might have bronchitis, which would require Rx for an inhaler and anti-biotics.</p>
<p>I went to my usual urgent care clinic to be seen and was told that since I had upper respiratory issues I needed to go back out to my car and wait for a nurse to come out and test me for Covid. The only test they offered was the long swab up your nose. I walked out and drove away. Tried my gen. practitioner and it was the same story. </p>
<p>I looked on my county's DHHS website for testing locations that offered the saliva (inside the cheek swab) test. I went to two different testing locations and was told I HAD to get the naso swab no matter what. I told both places I wanted only the saliva test, but was refused. The second place kind of creeped me out because I was trying to get a straight answer from the rude receptionist, and after giving me the same answer over and over again her co-worker mumbled something to her and both of them went silent. </p>
<p>So, am I to assume that these testing centers would rather me walk out, untested, while showing symptoms rather than give me the damn saliva test?!</p></p>

        <p>Don't get tested. Just get some rest, vitamins, and chicken soup.</p>

        <p>I've been tested twice - once in the hospital for threatened preterm labor, and once before going in to be induced. Both times, it was the nasal swab. I had to be tested both times in case I had to be taken back for surgery (which I did the second time), and because in general, I was going to be around babies and people who cared for babies. My struggle is that the tests are notoriously unreliable, to the point that it isn't necessarily worth getting the test if asymptomatic because proper precautions should be taken by the medical staff anyway. As far as getting tested, it was very uncomfortable, they weren't the most gentle putting the swab up there, I had a sore nose, but tested negative both times.</p>

        <p>Even worse when some places are considering daily tests 'if you don't vaccinate'.</p>
<p>Imagine having a swab jammed up your nose every day.. will most likely cause infection or other at that point.</p>
<p>It's all so incredibly stupid logic and invasive.</p>
<p>If my droplets are so deadly, why must they jam something up so high and into a 'protected' area that doesn't like to be invaded?</p>

        <p>I'm definitely not a fan of regular testing. My husband, who was with me both times in the hospital, only had to do a screening. He was even in the OR, with a cloth mask on, without being tested. Meanwhile, once I was in the OR and the screen was up, they let me remove my mask. Now, I'm not mad about this, just calling out the hypocrisy of it all. There's not much logic to it.</p>

        <p>Side note: I am not vaccinated and will not take the jab unless it's against my will. I was just trying to get proof of a negative test so I could see a doctor re: my bronchitis.</p>
