    <strong>Guess what happened when they tried to infect 100 healthy volunteers with Spanish Flu in 1919?</strong>
    <p><p>Nothing. </p>
<p>Nothing happened. Of the 100 volunteers, nobody, 0, got sick after having a group of Spanish Flu patients breathe in their mouth at an inch distance, nor by taking the mucus, blood of the sick and injecting the healthy volunteers with it. </p>
<p>This kind of stuff shows you that the commonly accepted germ theory of disease has serious flaws and inconsistencies, and does not reflect what happens in real life. Any scientific theory that has this should be reviewed closely as being an accurate model of disease causality. </p>

<p>Fact is, virology is rife with inconsistencies, gaping holes in scientific theories, that only come to light once you let go of the premise that viruses makes us ill, and can see things in a clear picture. It is a pseudoscience that should be cancelled. There would no covid19 without the Disney scientists of virology.</p></p>

        <p>Eleanor McBean, P.h.D, N.D summed up the Rockefeller Flu well:</p>
<p><strong>”WAS AN ON-THE-SPOT OBSERVER OF THE 1918 INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC</strong></p>
<p>All the doctors and people who were living at the time of the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic say it was the most terrible disease the world has ever had. Strong men, hale and hearty, one day would be dead the next. The disease had the characteristics of the black death added to typhoid, diphtheria, pneumonia, smallpox, paralysis and all the diseases the people had been vaccinated with immediately following World War 1. <strong>Practically the entire population had been injected "seeded" with a dozen or more diseases — or toxic serums.</strong> When all those doctor-made diseases started breaking out all at once it was tragic.</p>
<p>That pandemic dragged on for two years, kept alive with the addition of more poison drugs administered by the doctors who tried to suppress the symptoms. As far as I could find out, the flu hit only the vaccinated. Those who had refused the shots escaped the flu. My family had refused all the vaccinations so we remained well all the time. We knew from the health teachings of Graham, Trail, Tilden and others, that people cannot contaminate the body with poisons without causing disease.</p>
<p>When the flu was at its peak, all the stores were closed as well as the schools, businesses — even the hospital, as the doctors and nurses had been vaccinated too and were down with the flu. No one was on the streets. It was like a ghost town. <strong>We seemed to be the only family which didn’t get the flu; so my parents went from house to house doing what they could to look after the sick, as it was impossible to get a doctor then. If it were possible for germs, bacteria, virus, or bacilli to cause disease, they had plenty of opportunity to attack my parents when they were spending many hours a day in the sick rooms. But they didn’t get the flu and they didn’t bring any germs home to attack us children and cause anything.</strong> None of our family had the flu — not even a sniffle— and it was in the winter with deep snow on the ground.</p>
<p>When I see people cringe when someone near them sneezes or coughs, I wonder how long it will take them to find out that they can’t catch it — whatever it is. The only way they can get a disease is to develop it themselves by wrong eating, drinking, smoking or doing some other things which cause internal poisoning and lowered vitality. All diseases are preventable and most of them are cureable with the right methods, not known to medical doctors, and not all drugless doctors know them either.</p>
<p>It has been said that the 1918 flu epidemic killed 20,000,000 people throughout the world. <strong>But, actually, the doctors killed them with their crude and deadly treatments and drugs.</strong> This is a harsh accusation but it is nevertheless true, judging by the success of the drugless doctors in comparison with that of the medical doctors.</p>
<p>While the medical men and medical hospitals were losing 33% of their flu cases, the non-medical hospitals such as BATTLE CREEK, KELLOGG and MACFADDEN’S HEALTH-RESTORIUM were getting almost 100% healings with their water cure, baths, enemas, etc., fasting and certain other simple healing methods, followed by carefully worked out diets of natural foods. One health doctor didn’t lose a patient in eight years. The very successful health treatment of one of those drugless doctors who didn’t lose any patients will be given in the other part of this book, titled VACCINATION CONDEMNED, to be published a little later.</p>
<p>If the medical doctors had been as advanced as the drugless doctors, there would not have been those 20 million deaths from the medical flu treatment.</p>
<p><strong>There was seven times more disease among the vaccinated soldiers than among the unvaccinated civilians, and the diseases were those they had been vaccinated against.</strong> One soldier who had returned from overseas in 1912 told me that the <strong>army hospitals were filled with cases of infantile paralysis and he wondered why grown men should have an infant disease.</strong> Now, we know that <strong>paralysis is a common after-effect of vaccine poisoning.</strong> Those at home didn’t get the paralysis until after the world-wide vaccination campaign in 1918.”</p>

        <p>In the early 1920's the term post-vaccinal encephalitis was used in medical literature, aka brain inflammation due to vaccination, and possible sequelae of vaccination were recognized as potential causes of disease.</p>
<p>Today, they're all "safe and effective", and anybody even suggesting otherwise is ridiculed and will not get his study published. Because "sCiEnCe".</p>

        <p>Yup, so many classic sleight of hand scams. 
It’s admitted and public knowledge that Pharma is incredibly corrupt but their vaccine $cience is somehow trustworthy, even after <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)16746-9/fulltext">SV40</a> lol.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Horton is the editor in chief of the world’s leading medical journal, The Lancet.  Writing in his own journal he states that <strong>medical science has</strong> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“taken a turn towards darkness.”</a></p>
<p>Here’s another lie that plays out over and over.</p>
<p>“There are several other ways that statistics can be manipulated or falsified in order to create the impression that vaccines work. A common and well used technique is to ‘re-diagnose’. This means that if a patient presents the characteristic symptoms of a particular disease, yet has already been vaccinated against that disease, the doctor will diagnose something else. The National Anti-Vaccination League in Britain provides evidence of this in much of its literature. For example, chicken pox, according to medical authorities is a non-fatal disease. Yet, “In the thirty years ending in 1934, 3,112 people are stated to have died of chicken pox in England and Wales". The truth is that these people actually died of smallpox against which they had been previously vaccinated. Because of their vaccine status, however, their deaths were recorded as chicken pox. According to The Truth Teller, January 1927, "This has been admitted by English medical officers of health, and the Ministry of Health has twice stated in answer to questions in Parliament that vaccination is one factor in the diagnosis of these cases".</p>
<p><strong>George Bernard Shaw,</strong> the illustrious poet and also an <strong>ardent campaigner on public health issues, once stated:</strong></p>
<p>"During the last considerable epidemic at the turn of the century, I was a member of the Health Committee of London Borough Council, and <strong>I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases (of smallpox) as postular eczema, varioloid or what not - except smallpox".</strong></p>
