    <strong>Let's talk about TRUST</strong>
    <p><h1>How does government determine what choices we are allowed to make?</h1>
<p>The existence of governing bodies and the framework for progress that they construct determines the success or failure of that jurisdiction. Rules written and enforced by the government at the expense of the autonomy of citizens are to be carefully implemented, to ensure that the sacrifice of personal freedoms is undoubtedly justified given what societal benefits we get in return.</p>
<p>Some examples of this include:</p>
<p>– <strong>Freedom of choice does not apply to choices involving physically harming others</strong> (less violent crime at the expense of individual autonomy)</p>
<p>– <strong>Freedom of speech does not apply to inciting violence or threatening pubic safety</strong> (less violent crime and civilian casualties at the expense of individual autonomy)</p>
<p>– <strong>Freedom to exercise your right to privacy does not apply when you are</strong> <strong><em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em></strong> <strong>suspected of a serious crime</strong>. (increased accountability and justice at the expense of individual autonomy)</p>
<p>Freedom of personal choice comes at a cost, because it can often can have ripple effects on the rest of the larger group. Government is tasked with determining when these freedoms have the potential to have a negative impact on society, and determine where the line for freedom is drawn. Establishing this line is done so with the goal of maximizing personal choice while also minimizing the potential harm of those choices, or so it should be.</p>
<h1>The Selfishness of the Human Reward System</h1>
<p>Humans survive and thrive on reward. They are biologically programmed to seek things that supplement their survival. Food, water, sex, and shelter are the fundamental rewards humans are most inclined to seek. In order to ensure that search is fruitful, humans are constantly modifying their behavior in order to increase their potential to receive these rewards. As we see with drug and behavioral addictions, these brain mechanisms can be very difficult to override and control.</p>
<p>In modern society, these rewards often come at a monetary cost. Nothing is free.</p>
<p>Therefore, wealth determines the likelihood of satisfying these primal drives of ours. So we as humans acknowledge that wealth is an avenue to these rewards, and modify our behaviors regularly to acquire wealth. <strong>The drive to accumulate wealth is based on the hard-wired biological drive to seek the most primal rewards.</strong></p>
<p>Another avenue to primal rewards aside from money is <em>power.</em></p>
<p>Power gives people more opportunity to accumulate wealth. Wealth gives people more opportunity to accumulate power.</p>
<p><strong>Nobody is immune to the pull of reward-seeking behavior.</strong></p>
<p>The whole idea behind governing a large group of people involves drafting an agreed list of things that the we citizens have to do to keep the system going, things the system will provide us to promote that, and rules that we all must abide by while we do it. This, in theory, should apply to the writers and enforcers of these rules.</p>
<p>This naturally creates a hierarchy of power in that society. The manner in which the larger majority of that society lives their lives is determined and enforced by a small fraction of people within that jurisdiction. So the very nature of government calls for the general populace to agree on who, out of the whole group, makes the rules WE ALL follow.</p>
<p>In theory, given what we know about human biology, writers and enforcers are likely to acknowledge their influence over the larger group. They eventually realize that their advantageous position on the social ladder yields unique opportunities to more successfully seek out their primal rewards. They have the influence to set the stage in their favor.</p>
<p><strong>What if they were to capitalize on this relative advantage over the larger group?</strong></p>
<p>The original doctrine for all to abide by is modified to supplement their survival, or in other words, maximize their potential for receiving primal rewards. The revisions are added in such a way that the average citizen cannot benefit from them. But, this is only if the writers and enforcers of "the rules" are dishonest.</p>
<p>The question is, are the writers and enforcers of these rules honest enough to override their embedded, primal reward-seeking drive in order to honor the rules that they originally wrote? Are they willing to stare their power and influence in the face, and say</p>
<p><em>"I have the power to use my influence to benefit myself, but I will not because it is dishonest and harms people who do not have access to my power and influence."</em></p>
<p><strong>Have you ever played the game of "telephone" in grade school?</strong></p>
<p>The whole fun of the game is to see how the original message changes as it is transmitted through a long line of people. The information the third person in line receives is entirely dependent on what the second person tells them, which is dependent on the original message from the first person, etc.</p>
<p>Information is more vulnerable to change the further it has to travel. If I'm 50th in line, my insight on the original message from the first person is not reliable.</p>
<h1>Enter the pandemic.</h1>
<p>We have an ethical dilemma on our hands.</p>
<p>Do the dangers that COVID-19 pose to the larger group justify stripping citizens of their medical autonomy?</p>
<p>The urgency to get vaccinated, expressed by the governments around the world, is quickly escalating. As a jurisdiction of people, we have reached an impasse where we have to TBT to the core principles that laid the foundation for our original doctrine. Many will exercise their autonomy by vaccinating, while others wish to exercise it by rejecting the vaccine. <strong>Is mandating the sacrifice of personal choice to be inoculated in the interest of public safety justified given the circumstances?</strong></p>
<p>To many, skeptics are simply refusing to accept reality. They still whine about personal choice despite all of the research supporting the safety and efficacy of these vaccines, and can't see that mandating them would eradicate the virus in due time. Why aren't they trusting the science?</p>
<p>Everyone is pleading to these people to just "trust the science". But none of that matters to anti-vaxxers, so they must just be selfish. They must not care about the death, disease, and financial ruin that this virus has left in its path thus far. They are pissing all over the efforts of the greatest scientific minds the world has to offer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Or</em></strong></p>
<p>Could it be that these people are putting into question the ethics of the "writers and enforcers" of the jurisdiction that sign off on this science and the rules that follow it. Do they need to be convinced that the writers and enforcers of the jurisdiction are morally above using the vaccine for nefarious purposes?</p>
<p><strong>"Trust the science" is a euphemism for "Trust those that enforce the rules of the land."</strong></p>
<p>If a guy walks into a store and says to the cashier, "I have a gun in my jacket, give me your money", many people will probably put up, shut up, and empty the register. But they also probably can't help but think, "What if he's just bluffing?" Whether he's bluffing or not, the robber is in complete control, because most people aren't willing to risk their life in that situation. The robber uses his influence over the situation (the guy who might have a gun) to obtain a higher reward. This is all at the expense of the cashier, who had their wealth taken from them and is now traumatized by the experience, all without ever seeing a gun. <strong>Fear drives compliance, even if that fear is based on a lie.</strong> Do those with the most influence in the world have a gun in their jacket?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter. Influence is an avenue to our most primal rewards. Those who have influence over the rules, the money, and the science are slaves to the same reward-seeking tendencies that you and I are. And given the opportunity, they could lie straight to your face to maximize their potential for reward, and nobody would ever know, besides those who share that influence.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, they override this natural drive to seek higher rewards for the greater good.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line is: Do we trust them to do that?</strong></p></p>

        <p>Wonderfully put. This sums up nicely exactly what I have been weighing the entire time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  history shows that those in power are not on the side of the ones that aren't.</p>
<p>Therefore to me, there is more onus on them to prove they're trustworthy. As of yet, they've refused to do so.</p>

        <p>No. This is why we had checks and balances and measures to limit the power of government.</p>
<p>Instead all I've seen is those checks, balances, reviews, discussion COMPLETELY TOSSED OUT and huge sweeping changes affecting the lives and futures of Canadians IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT REVIEW and moving fast.</p>
<p>A one year Mask mandate in  my province alone? There wasn't even a pretense of a 14 day Mask mAndate! It was imply implemented and NOT LIFTED FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR - without any further justification needed or anything to stop it.</p>
<p>It is lifted now only to demonstrate the ULTIMATE AUTHORITY that government and health officials now have over our lives our futures AND SOON OUR VERY OWN BODY WITH MANDATED VACCINATION.</p>
<p>"Oh it won't happen!" they said.</p>

        <p>I don't trust the GOVT for a lot of things.  Also, I wonder why gasoline prices are so high now compared to the last four years? Hmmmmm, Biden shutting down the pipeline and other American Infrastructural jobs.</p>
