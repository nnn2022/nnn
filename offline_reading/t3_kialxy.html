        <p>Atlanta is absolutely open. Its a sleeper imo and it will boom way more then it does. I see a shift happening from LA, NYC, Chicago towards Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Dallas and Floridian cities. Maybe even Memphis as its a major freight transportation hub, like Atlanta is for passengers. The big markets will be there, NYC, Bay Area, Philadelphia, Chicago and LA will decline into oblivilion.</p>

        <p>I'm less sold on Florida than many here - I've heard a lot of conflicting information on it. Some say it's quite open all around, some say the restrictions are mostly contained to the major cities, some say most people are wearing masks and business are still fairly restricted (though probably by choice). In addition, almost all of the cities with over 100k residents (Palm Bay and Lakeland being the two exceptions, I believe) have at least some sort of mask mandate in place. Most cities that aren't too restricted in generad seem to be either retirement towns or little beach towns. Or both.</p>
<p>I want to be in on Florida, but I'm just not sure how to feel about it.</p>
<p>So aside from Florida, South Dakota. Easily. The people there also seem to be, for the most part, quite the "Live your life, I'll live mine" type, also. Though it's terribly unfortunate that Sioux Falls recently passed a mask mandate that will run through the end of March, I believe. Rapid City is likely next. That said, there seems to be heavyyy resistance from the citizens, and from what I've heard, many people and businesses don't abide by the mandate. There's no penalty for doing so, similarly to Florida.</p>
<p>Missouri is one that's actually picking up some notoriety. They're currently and have been previously pretty lax with restrictions, other than in St. Louis and Kansas City. Even the suburbs of those cities, specifically St. Louis, are quite open.</p>
<p>Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee are up there too. Still not quite on par with South Dakota or Florida though.</p>
<p>North Dakota is solid, despite some mask mandates being passed.</p>
<p>Texas seems to be improving day by day.</p>
<p>Oklahoma isn't a bad option.</p>
<p>Arizona seems to be improving and trending in the right direction.</p>
<p>After that, ehhhh.</p>

        <p>It all depends on YOU. </p>
<p>I have NEVER, NOT ONCE worn the muzzle. People who tell you that they have to are lying cowards. </p>
<p>Most of the keyboard warriors on this sub are terrified of the idea of even trying to step into a grocery store without a muzzle on. </p>
<p>Because of these cowards we will eventually have actual laws mandating the muzzle. But for now the "restrictions" are only self induced. </p>
<p>In case you're wondering I've tried this in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado.</p>

        <p>Well it highly depends on where you're trying to go without a mask, both state and city/town. Obviously some places are a lot more lax about it and are nice areas to live in. So going without a mask without being arrested/punched in the face by the ever-tolerant citizens can be quite easy, or quite difficult. Not everyone always feels like getting bitched at, either.</p>

        <p>No, says the police in a sketchy ass big city that will fine/arrest you for trying to enter a business without a mask while lockdowns and mandates are in effect, if someone doesn't beat you up and throw you out first. As opposed to a cute little safe, small town in the middle of nowhere that doesn't have so much as a mask mandate in place. Two totally different leagues.</p>
<p>Personally, I have no issues going anywhere without a mask as long as there isn't a mandate in place where I'd be fined/arrested for going without one. Did it all the time, and the same goes for tons of others in my state. That is, until our government required you wear a mask at all times when in public, and then made it unable for you to enter a business without a mask. I'm all for the cause, but I'm not going to totally fuck myself over just for no one to care and nothing of substance to happen as a result.</p>
<p>Feel sorry for your team as much as you want, but at the end of the day, we're all still on the same side, whether you like it or not.</p>

        <p>Oh stop it, I'm a bartender and literally never wore my mask over my nose until the state started cracking down on us. Most of the time, it was worn under my chin. Likewise for all of my co-workers. I went to a packed ass beach town this summer with two friends. Almost no one had a mask on. Many live bands, and absolutely packed bars with no one socially distancing. Also over the summer, I interviewed for many jobs where myself and the interviewer bitched about all the restrictions and regulations that they're being put through. Most owners/managers didn't give one fuck about social distancing or wearing a mask as soon as they saw I didn't. Shook many, many hands. I essentially never wore a mask until the last month, when I faced very real repercussions for not doing so. Repercussions that heavily outweighed the benefit of not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Are you saying there's absolutely no difference in not wearing a mask in a sketchy ass big city with many restrictions and with lockdowns in place where you'll be fined/arrested/beaten up for attempting to be inside a business without a mask, versus a tiny little town in middle America that doesn't even have so much as a mask mandate or any business restrictions in place, where no one gives a fuck?</p>
<p>I get it, some people are a bit uneasy when it comes to not wearing a mask, and it can be annoying. But honestly, they probably have good reason to be hesitant. Many people are fucking psycho about insisting you wear one, and it can be something that actively fucks you over, while also making you lose friends and family. Not everyone wants to have that in their lives. I'm confident that most here aren't that way. But even if everyone 100% was (aside from you, of course), flipping out on them doesn't help whatsoever. Try to inspire them, provide them with a good support system, and ease them into it. As opposed to bitching at them, which helps absolutely no one.</p>
<p>Again, same team. Gotta get over it.</p>
