<p>This interview is a discussion of the efficacy of Ivermectin and some other alternatives that may be viable, low-risk, treatments for COVID that are being actively ignored and suppressed by The Cathedral.Bret and Heather of the Darkhorse podcast are experts in biology and are incredibly honest and trustworthy people. They do not change their opinions due to popular trends or propaganda. These people are NOT right-wing conspiracy theorist anti-vaxxers.</p></p>

        <p>I remember he talking on the JRP about the virus looking like it was enhanced like 9 months ago. This guy knows what he's talking about, and the sketchy shit going down on pharma.</p>

        <p>He addressed it early last year in his podcast too. He said the nature of the virus was a-typical for what is currently known. The ease at which it infects people and certain characteristics that were found during studies showed it was likely man-made rather than something that occurred naturally. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, they supported masks and other safety measures at the beginning. I say that to ensure that nobody thinks of them as either conspiracy theorists or covidians. I think they are normal, rational, trustworthy people that have evolved there ideas as time has gone on.   </p>
<p>Sometimes I found them a little too nice (ie. surely it was incompetence rather than malice) but Im just a little blackpilled at this point. hahaha</p>
