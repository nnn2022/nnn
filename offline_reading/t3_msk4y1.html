    <strong>My fellow Canadians, it is time to take a stand against tyranny and let our voices be heard.</strong>
    <p><p>It has been a year since the Canadian government began taking actions to combat the spread of Covid-19, ever since the first action taken on their part we have only further descended into unjustified tyranny.</p>
<p>We are constantly told that despite doing massive amounts of avoidable harm, these lockdowns and stay at home orders are necessary, with the only evidence for these claims being true being projections by “experts” that have been consistently wrong.</p>
<p>We are also constantly told that the amount of cases is justification and a valid reason for increasingly authoritarian virus measures. </p>
<p>The problem with that is that during an Ontario public health broadcast, Dr. Barbara yaffe, the Director of Communicable Disease Control &amp; Associate Medical Officer of Health for Toronto Public Health, openly admitted that in areas with “high Covid” at the cycles currently being employed, the main Covid test being administered, the PCR test (polymerase chain reaction), can produce false positives up to 50% of the time (1). </p>
<p>(1) https://youtu.be/3COXVbP5WdI</p>
<p>This is the direct quote:</p>
<p>“You know I think a lot of people think the testing is going to really solve the whole problem and it isn’t, it’s one component of a response. If you test somebody today, uh, you only know if they’re infected today. And in fact if you’re testing in a population that doesn’t have very much Covid, you’ll get false positives almost half the time. That is the person actually doesn’t have Covid, they have something else, they may have nothing. Uh, so it will just complicate the picture.”</p>
<p>What this essentially lets us know, is that the Canadian government is perfectly willing to use positive tests as a justification to enact increasing levels of tyranny upon their own population despite knowing full well the numbers are almost assuredly extremely inaccurate, further proving their intentions are nowhere near as benevolent as they would like you to think.</p>
<p>We have seen so many instances of unjust tyranny, from people being arrested on the basis of too many people gathering for New Year’s Eve (2), to churches being besieged by hundreds of armed riot police solely due to citizens attempting to exercise their constitutional right to religious gathering (3).</p>
<p>(2) https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-police-new-years-altercation-1.5859782</p>
<p>(3) https://mobile.twitter.com/ezralevant/status/1381361461189091333</p>
<p>We are being told this is all for our own safety and this is what must be done, but I reject this notion in it’s entirety. </p>
<p>What is happening is nothing short of tyranny on our home soil perpetrated by our blatantly corrupt government. These lockdowns do immeasurable harm to the populations upon which they are inflicted in a multitude of different ways. </p>
<p>First off, these lockdowns do extreme damage to those affected by it financially. they don’t allow many people to be able to work and provide for themselves and their family, they force small businesses to shut down despite knowing that it will force them to close permanently and all while big corporate box stores stay open and rake in cash without competition. </p>
<p>They absolutely decimate the mental health of the populations that are forced to endure them. The mental stress from the social isolation, the constant stream of fearporn and propaganda on the news, the perception of their own life and the lives of their families and friends being in danger and the inability to go about one's life in the manner that one desires had lead to an extremely prescient and devastating mental health crisis (4), along with an extremely damaging opioid crisis as well (5).</p>
<p>(4) https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/lockdowns-have-led-to-tripling-of-canadian-youth-suicide-attempts-hospital-stats</p>
<p>(5) https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/canadian-opioid-deaths-skyrocket-in-wake-of-covid-19-lockdown-measures</p>
<p>Despite knowing the avoidable and unjustified harm these lockdowns are having, the Canadian government has no plans to cease their implementation and only has gotten more tyrannical and more authoritarian in their approach. </p>
<p>When will we wake up and realize that none of this is for the good of the people? This is obviously not about our health, nor has it been since the beginning. </p>
<p>This is about the government having an excuse to further encroach upon our rights and freedoms and appear justified in doing so to those who lack the ability for critical thought. This is all about control over us, period.</p>
<p>As of when this was written, Ontario premier Doug Ford had just extended stay at home orders, increased restrictions and has authorized police to be able to stop and question anybody outside about where they are going and see if they have a “valid reason to leave home” (6).</p>
<p>(6) https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/ontario-goes-communist-checkpoints-at-borders-churches-restricted-playgrounds-closed</p>
<p>When will Canadians realize their freedoms are in danger and their rights are on the verge of becoming meaningless?</p>
<p>Our rights and freedoms are being slowly taken from us and we are being conditioned to believe it is necessary. </p>
<p>It’s time to stop acting like complacent livestock and take a stand for what is righteous and what is correct. We must stand up for our rights and freedoms and remember that we, the people have the power.</p>
<p>Go forth my fellow Canadians, stand up for your freedom and take a stand in the name of liberty. We’ve allowed this tyranny to occur for far too long, it’s time we make our voices heard. </p>
<p>Godspeed brothers and sisters, liberty will prevail.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you brother. Despite how it’s currently looking, we Canadians are far from cattle and will not keep allowing this happen on our soil without letting our voices be heard.</p>
<p>Glad to know we’ve got the support of some fellow patriots down in Texas. When I do visit, your state will be first on the list. Godspeed.</p>

        <p>Something big is coming. </p>
<p>I’m not sure if you’ve seen, but there was a supposedly leaked email from the liberal party circulating a few months ago. </p>
<p>It laid out a list of steps that would be taken and events that would take place and so far it has been eerily accurate.</p>
<p>The ending point of it all is the great reset, where we will essentially be subjected to globalist communism and deprived of many of our rights, including our right to personal property.</p>

<p><strong><em>“w: LPC Strategic Committee LeakInboxLPC leaker &lt;‪LPC_leaker@protonmail.com‬&rt;1:47 PM (7 hours ago)toHello,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ On Saturday, October 10, 2020 1:38 PM, REMOVED &lt;REMOVED&rt; wrote:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>_Dear </strong><strong><em>*</em>,_</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I want to provide you some very important information. I'm a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I need to start off by saying that I'm not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 - early January 2021</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 - Q2 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada's HealthPass) .</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told "the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details".</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I've ever witnessed before.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>All I know is that I don't like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.”</em></strong></p>

        <p>That’s the facts right there.</p>
<p>We modern people suffer from such a profound historical ignorance, it is just sickening. </p>
<p>I cannot believe my country does not understand the need for an armed populace, they’ve probably all been sold on nonsensical leftist gun control rhetoric. A real shame.</p>

        <p>May first in montreal at the olympic stadium, Massive protest! Hopefully, it will be big enough to scare them. After this, if the protest is not talked on TV, I think violence will arise. If downtown haven't been destroyed by the George Flyod's protest ( wednesday 21 april) before then. Montreal will become a warzone, I'm afraid I won't be able to get out of there in time!</p>
