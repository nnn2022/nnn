    <strong>Will vaccine-refusers be blamed for the upcoming monetary collapse?</strong>
    <p><p>Just my speculation. Although the german Chancellor made very clear that while there will be no mandatory vaccinations, she insists that the restrictions will only be lifted again if 60% (which of course will be increased to 80% once 60% is reached) of the population will get vaccinated. One reason Germany hasn't had a huge lockdown-induced banking crash yet is because 800.000 bankrupt businesses (every fourth business in germany)  are allowed to not declare bankruptcy to their banks, which usually is a crime, but now has been allowed since march. The decriminalization of not declaring bankruptcy is being prolonged indefinitely, just like the lockdowns, which will very likely result in a banking-crash once those businesses are legally forced to declare it again, so the goverment basically has a big crash-enhancing-switch (there are other switches of course, which might be pressed at the same time) at their disposal. The only question is when will they press it , which I think will be the time when every voluntary vaccination has been finished (which of course will not reach the flexible vaccination-goal). At this stage Merkel will declare that she is forced to keep the lockdown going because of the evil "anti-vaxxers" refusing to get vaccinated which will increase hatred for vaccine-refusers like crazy. After building up huge social and economic pressure the following weeks they will press the switch, making everything collapse while blaming the vaccine refusers for this, saying that those additional weeks of lockdown caused by them were the tipping point that caused everything to collapse.(once germany crashes all of europe crashes btw) Once everything is in ruins mandatory state-enforced vaccinations will be rolled out.</p></p>

        <p>Not German so don't know the specifics in their locale but it is generally possible to continue a business trading while being insolvent. You can have £100 in the bank, but if that is your total assets while owing more than £100 to taxes, wages, suppliers etc, then you are technically insolvent but can carry on trading by selective non-payment of certain liabilities. It will all catch up at some point and collapse, usually when an unpaid creditor wins a court order for non payment of a debt and can then petition for bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>That is what is going to happen. I mean it's already happening in America with them forcing each other. It's just so terrifying to see that people just don't think and accept that these vaccines are safe. When the information is behind a black box that they don't even bother to read.</p>

        <p>I agree that whatever happens over the next months will have the effect of totally demonizing the Covid deniers.  Something will breakdown in the distribution of the vaccine and that will be blamed squarely on the covid skeptics.</p>
