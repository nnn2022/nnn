    <strong>We need to give them an easy out...</strong>
    <p><p>The ones supporting the vaccine, that label everyone questioning it as "antivax" need an easy out if they are going to switch sides and listen to the actual evidence. </p>
<p>Sides have been created purposefully to create division and make it harder for people to change their minds when new evidence comes up. </p>
<p>On their side there is constant praise and rewards. They have "the science" they are following which makes them feel superior in their knowledge. They don't have to spend any time reading studies, they don't have to admit they don't understand certain things or acknowledge that others may know more than them because they have been fed simple, easy parrotable lines and "facts" that they can repeat to dismiss each claim against vaccines before you can even get a chance to show or discuss evidence. </p>
<p>They are made to feel they have a moral highground because they are being selfless and protecting others.
Their "I've been vaccinated" posts on social media are the most liked of anything. They get constant reinforcement they are amazing and heroic for doing it. </p>
<p>They've been given an easy label to anyone that disagrees "antivax" and they have been praised and rewarded for labelling and belittling people themselves. </p>
<p>All the stuff they want to do in life is available to them whilst they stick to their group and it contains the majority of society and the people they associate with. </p>
<p>Humans never want to admit they are wrong, it's literally built into us from evolution. We are also programed to never want to go against our "tribe"
Add to that the fact that on "our side" they get threatened with everything being taken away, they can be considered selfish instead of ulteristic. They would have to go against their friends and loved ones and risk being ridiculed, and they know how bad the ridiculing can be because they have done it themselves. They have already shunned and alienated people themselves, they would have to join sides with those people which is highly embarrassing after the way they have treated them.</p>
<p>They get lumped in with all the people they have spent their lives calling crazy and stupid and conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>They could potentially lose their jobs, their incomes, their friends, their families. And at this stage, as much as the mountain of evidence against these vaccines is growing fast we really can't be 100% sure at this moment on anything either way. We can't give them absolute guarantees. In their eyes they could potentially be enduring all that for nothing and be wrong again </p>
<p>A lot of us are finding it hard to withstand the pressure of standing by our values on this with those threats, the pressure of switching sides is even more but staying on their own side involves doing nothing and seems way safer. </p>
<p>This has literally been designed by psychologists, you can tell just by looking at everything I've listed above. 
If we want them to have the chance to change their minds with all this new evidence then we need to give them an easy way to do so. That allows them to keep the moral highground in the eyes of their group, not lose face and gives tangible benefits. </p>
<p>I'm not smart enough to figure out what that is but between us there has to be an angle to this that we can find to offer them. 
It's the only way the pendulum gets to swing back to common sense and stop this censorship. We need to get rid of these groups and divides and find common ground and build bridges with compassion with them.
I know its not easy to want to when we are being treated this way but to do anything else is just playing into the narrative that's designed. </p>
<p>We are at a really important stage I feel, the first little bits of negative vaccine info is starting to appear in main stream media, I really think if we can figure out the easy out for them now we can stop this nonsense</p></p>

        <p>They won't ever admit ignorance or wrong, like you said. What they will continue to do is shift their narrative and then burry the old narrative under the rug. Remember how they said it was xenophobic to shut down boarders? Now they want to shut down and want passports. Remember how they said this starting in a Chinese lab was racist? Now they're riving the investigation. Remember how they said Trump was a moron for saying we'd have a vaccine by year's end? Now they are strong arming us into taking it.</p>

        <p>100% agree, but my thinking is maybe we need to let them. Is it more important for them to acknowledge they were wrong or to stop this?</p>
<p>You make a really good point about the trump part. Maybe the angle of these vaccines being rushed through so trump could have them start whilst he was still in office is a way to give them an out and save face? 
They need a bad guy to shift the blame onto. I'm not for or against trump, I think there was good and bad to him as there is with all politicians and he appeared to at least be a bit more transparent than most. But the pro-vaccine group is also almost exclusively in the extreme anti-trump group. Just an idea though</p>

        <p>Their “out” for pretending to be wise when they were just following the pack? How would they ever benefit from such a thing? </p>
<p>The truth is their parents already failed them, which is why they are adult brats. You don’t coddle a brat or they don’t learn how to not be a brat. These people need to be humiliated. Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance - that is their true path to becoming a better person. Don’t rob them of that.</p>

        <p>I'm going to respectfully disagree on that, it doesn't work and makes them dig in harder. Especially because a lot of debating on it happens online.</p>
<p>There's a great way to brainwash people, the Chinese use it in their re-education camps. You get someone to write on a topic repeatedly in their own words. The more they do that and then defend the position they have written the more it becomes ingrained as their idea, its the quickest and easiest way to brainwash someone.</p>
<p>Every argument on the Internet works in that way. People have their view that they've been told to think "vaccines good, question it your antivax" for example. We challenge them on it, they then have to in their own words write why, the more you make them defend it the more they are brainwashing themselves. It happens with every topic and I feel its why we are so divided these days.</p>
<p>I get what you are saying about the stages and I'd be more inclined to agree if all discussions about this were in person but unfortunately they aren't</p>

        <p>You don’t have a better solution though. You can’t coddle them into it, they’re likely to be more stubborn. </p>
<p>I was a liberal for most of my life. It was a difficult moment around the age of 30 or 31 when I suddenly started to realize everything I believed was wrong and everything I was told was a lie. </p>
<p>I distinctly remember internally entertaining the possibility that I could just go into denial, lean on logical fallacies, pretend, and save myself embarrassment. I didn’t choose that path because at some point in my life I learned that honesty and integrity was more important than pride. </p>
<p>A lot of these crazy COVID people are just brats that haven’t learned basic life lessons yet. Just like with children, there’s no short cuts to fixing this. You need to be hard with them or they will never learn.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don't have a solution which is why I'm putting this out here to brainstorm and see if others do. 
I do think meeting them with compassion and giving them a way out would help, when I've been able to speak alone with them very quickly they have opened up that they want to switch sides but they are scared to lose everything and don't understand enough to make a decision themselves. Particularly they're scared of losing family members or friends. It's happened enough times now for me to think its possible on mass if we find the right angle</p>
<p>It's impressive you did that, I had a very similar situation around that age and I agree that you learn important lessons from it. I know I learned a huge amount and am still learning daily but you have to remember that it takes a strong character to be able to face your flaws like that. You have that, the majority of people don't.</p>
<p>In any other situation I'd fully agree with you that it's the best way. But in this particular one there isn't unlimited time. I don't know what it's like in whatever country you are in, but in mine at least its getting very very close to being mandated, for some jobs it basically is. We are still in forms of lockdown and have been the entire of this year.</p>
<p>And in other places children are already dying and being injured. 
There's times and places for different battles, sometimes you have to use different tactics in different situations. It's not letting them win or giving into bratty behaviour, it's being smart enough to understand when to use what weapons. Once enough people move over to make this the majority then the harder lessons can be brought in.</p>
<p>Just my opinion though, not trying to convince you and as I say I don't disagree entirely. I just feel more divide is the last thing we need right now.</p>
<p>It's super late where I am now so going to bed but it has been good to hear your views on it. Hope you have a good day/night</p>
