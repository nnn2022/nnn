    <strong>A lovely little rant for you</strong>
    <p><p>I'm about to log off and go for a walk because after looking at various things online I'm about to combust. I'm looking at the latest pile of nonsense where the CDC is attempting to justify their revision on mask-wearing from earlier this week. My feelings are as follows...</p>
<p>Vaccines WERE something you take once and it gives you lifelong immunity for the most part. The MRNA treatments are Gene therapies they are only to reduce symptoms, they don't prevent disease at all. You can still contract the disease and spread it.</p>
<p>How is it possible that people that are vaccinated carry similar levels of the virus as unvaccinated people? How is it possible? The point of a vaccine is to train the body to sufficiently fight off infections and that means preventing the pathogen from replicating. What is going on if you have vaccinated and unvaccinated people with similar viral load levels?</p>
<p>The whole point of a traditional vaccine is to protect you  and protect others... to prevent the spread of the disease and to prevent you from getting it. These treatments don't do either. Vaccines are dead or weakened pathogen that stimulate antibody production. They've even changed the definition of vaccine since this whole mess started. Why would they have to do that? Because they know the MRNA shots are not vaccines. They are a treatment to reduce the severity of an illness. Now they are calling vaccines biological preparations. Too many people think this thing is going to prevent illness and it's not. At least be honest with people and let them make an informed decision. A lot of people honestly don't realize this will not prevent them from getting sick.</p>
<p>Now add to that they admitted the PCR test is shit and they are getting rid of it soon but not yet, they are STILL USING IT. Depending on how they run it and they've run it on a multitude of Cycles, It's not distinguishing between the seasonal flu which is also a coronavirus and this virus they claim is a killer black plague on Humanity.  The numbers are not accurate. And how are they testing for Delta? . We haven't gotten any answers to that. I don't think ordinary Labs have that capability, I think Labs on a state or federal level do but not the ordinary person is getting tested at a local place. As of the last time I knew (from someone I know who works at a major lab here) there is no way they can test for these variants on a local level. Maybe that's changed? I don't think so.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that many doctors stopped testing for seasonal flu when this started, I work in healthcare in New York. I've seen this first hand. The flu didn't just go away. Do people really believe that masks stopped the seasonal flu but the sneaky covid-19 was able to pass on through? It just wasn't being tested for. And now we know that the tests are faulty and they often don't distinguish between types of coronavirus based on cycles used which have been all over the place . A lot of those cases were seasonal flu.</p>
<p>They keep acting like every single number is death. It's not and they have not once told people to work on losing weight if they are obese ( if you can demand others get injected against their will for you, the medical community should be able to recommend things YOU can do to increase your odds of survival if you become ill) , get some exercise, take vitamins, eat healthy and work on strengthening your body and your mind. Not once! If the government truly cared about people they would have started some sort of wellness program. But they don't, they don't care about you this is not about your health no matter what they make it seem. How about giving people vitamin packets and exercise programs to help them build their immune system and get stronger?</p>
<p>We never hear any details. Diet, age, lifestyle Etc. It's just a blob of numbers that you can't relate to anything.</p>
<p>And another thing, why do they absolutely never talk about treatments except to say don't take this or that it's bad for you or doesn't work. The only solution is the vaccine! They have gone so far as to make dumbass propaganda using questionable "doctors" saying patients are about to be intubated and they're begging for the vaccine. If you were at the point where you were about to be intubated I highly doubt you would able be able to sit there and beg for a vaccine. There's just so much here. I can't believe how trusting and accepting people are of everything they are being told and the constant moving of goalposts and changing story. The fact that they Trust officials like they do is so frustrating . And not only are they overly trusting they are downright nasty and angry about it if you don't for totally legit reasons. "Science is changing again" means we are creating new lies because we are losing control of you. </p>
<p>They say NOTHING about what the goal is, we can assume is making this not exist anymore which is impossible because it's endemic but we need to keep this thing going.</p>
<p>The hospitalization rate of the super duper killer Delta variant is 1 %</p>
<p>The death rate is 0%</p>
<p>The vaccine does not lower your symptoms</p>
<p>The vaccine does not lower your odds of being hospitalized</p>
<p>The vaccine does not make you any less contagious</p>
<p>Despite all of this let's wear masks forever and threaten to lock everything down anyway just like we did before. Oh and let's threaten to starve and fire anyone who doesn't want to go along with this increasingly insane bullshit. </p>

        <p>One vaccine seems reasonable okay all right it takes a second one okay but now all of a sudden we got boosters and now all of a sudden it's annual and where does the actual vaccine go it's like throwing plastic straws in the ocean they have to go somewhere they end up in the adrenal glands to end up in the ovaries in the kidney in your lymph nodes and that's just for one - now start doing it for two, three, four, - five times - it's going to kill people - or without a doubt it's like throwing plastic straws in your ovaries - like it is not going to help you to reproduce - and nobody is even allowed to talk about simple basic math like that.</p>

        <p>I agree! I think I remember hearing about them working on a medication to lessen side effects. Really? If you need a medication to help you tolerate the vaccine maybe it's not that great?</p>

        <p>The big pharmaceutical companies spend so much advertising that mainstream media would never bite the hand that feeds it. Any journalist with the balls to go after this story would be shut down. Pfizer has more influence over Congress than the Surgeon General, Health Department and their own constituency combined. When our economy crashes with the next rigged wall street crash and the US dollar is no longer  the reserve currency (bye bye Petro dollar) they already have the covid narrative up and going to deflect the blame, criticism and furious wrath off of our corporate masters.</p>

        <p>Just wondering, where did you get the info on the 1% hospitalization rate with the delta variant and a 0% death rate?  I‚Äôve searched and on the sites I found I saw a 5% death rate and 20% hospitalization rate on average‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm also on like nbc and cdc sites so I could just be getting propaganda stats like the original COVID numbers.</p>
