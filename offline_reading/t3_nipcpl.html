    <strong>Retreat until there's nowhere to retreat?</strong>
    <p><p>I need to complain about something I have been observing on NNNA for a while. Everyday we are losing our rights and some people suggest capitulation. Examples:</p>
<p>Universities mandate covid "vaccine "
-some NNN people(snnnp): go to states/universities with no mandate 
Then more universities and states mandate it
-snnnp: learn a trade quit college education 
Is it how we are going to survive? What if those trades, jobs, places require the vaccine? Are we going to accept the defeat each time?
Anothet very common snnnp comment: Move to a feee state like Florida. 
How can half of the country move to a handful of relatively free state. It is not easy/possible for some people. Not everyone have the means to do either. And what if those free states start to follow the dystopian ones? Didn't they follow them for months. How can we trust those governors?</p></p>

        <p>I’ll be straight with you: I am one of those people you’re complaining about.</p>
<p>The reason we’re giving this kind of advice is because there really isn’t anything else we can do about it. Dispersed as we are, we don’t have the numbers or concentration of numbers to fend off the Great Reset.</p>
<p>No amount of protesting, marching, petitioning, voting, etc. is going to fend off the new normal. The technocrats own our courts, our elected officials, and control the elections themselves. Voting and protesting are about as useful as a bathing suit in Antarctica, and the latter may soon prove equally dangerous.</p>
<p>However, if we retreat to our strongholds—states like Florida, occupations like trades—we <em>will</em> command the concentration of numbers necessary to stand a chance of halting the new normal in those locations and occupations. We won’t be spread thin if we “retreat.” If we can flock in numbers to our strongholds, we might be able to become the “dragon” they don’t want to poke—yes, they might be able to defeat us with the military, but if we can gather such that the cost to them would be too high, then we might stand a chance of being left alone to go back to some semblance of our old normal.</p>
