    <strong>A little help?</strong>
    <p><p>So my friends and I were talking last night. They’re all pissed about a second lockdown and are (finally) starting to question wtf is actually going on. </p>
<p>I was wondering if y’all could share some content that’s kind of intro level to this agenda unfolding before us. I mentioned the WEF, agenda 2030 etc but immediately I could tell my small snapshot of this very complicated web was too much info at once haha </p>
<p>So yeah, if you have any relatively easy to absorb material send it my way! Thanks a bunch</p></p>

        <p>Before delving into more complicated stuff, start with the basics.</p>
<p>List off every ratcheting down of our public life ("social" distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, business closures, vaccines). Explain that these have been sold as "temporary measures", but we are almost a year in, with no end in sight. <em>Ask them if any of these measures have accomplished anything.</em></p>
<p>Explain how the goalposts keep moving - from "flatten the curve", to "just a short lockdown", to "masks, distancing, and lockdowns, until further notice", to "It's only until a vaccine", to "It's going to go on until whothefuckknows, even with a vaccine". <em>Ask them if this makes any sense.</em></p>
<p>Most importantly, ask them "<em>If I had said to you ten years ago, or even five, that the government would knowingly destroy the economy, ban protests, imprison people in their own homes, and forced you to wear a mask, what would you have said?' "You would have said I was crazy."</em></p>
<p>Once you see a light of recognition in their eyes, then you are ready say <em>"Now, you need to ask yourself... Why is this happening?"</em></p>
<p>Bear in mind that some will be impervious to reason. They are so invested in the narrative that they simply can't ever admit they have been played for fools.</p>

        <p>Very well said, you have to really slow with people like this.  It's a big shift in their mindset, and if we see any glimmer of hope than they might be reovering their reason,  we can't scare them away. What's happening is very scary and people don't want to be frightened. Go slow and open their eyes one step at a time</p>
