    <strong>Centralization is what got us into this. Decentralization seems the only way out of this mess. Humans need to start to think local, and prepare for the upcoming disruptions.</strong>
    <p><p>We need to decentralize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Healthcare. Convid19 has shown that 3 bought WHO guys can tell doctors in the world there is a pandemic of an invented disease caused by a pathogen that wasn't even isolated. This top-down healthcare system, with corrupted experts at the top writing for us the overarching "truth" and influencing national guidelines everywhere, which everyone below in the system needs to follow, dumbs down the whole medical society. There is no more room for generating own evidence, insights, valididating theories, and trying out different solutions. Some professionals still can think independently, but the system does not allow them to voice their opinion. The peer-review medical journal system is tightly controlled, corrupt. Papers that will question the agenda narratives, get frustrated or blocked altogether in the main journals, if you control 10-20 editors of major journals, you're pretty much in control of the medical/scientific truth. We are being held in a cage, because we have built a system that works like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food supply. An ever more centralized food supply chain has made mankind very vulnerable to any kind of (deliberate) system shock. If you hadn't noticed, the world is facing a growing list of food supply chain disruptions, brewing into an unprecedented nightmare scenario, if somewhere another chain breaks. It's looking pretty grim on the short to medium term atm. We need to stop being dependent on mega-corporations for our food production (incl. seeds) and distribution. Meat shortages will be created, they tested this briefly during covid, and the push for artificial GMO meat will grow. Meat and livestock will be further demonized. A humanity that does not get proper proteins anymore, will be weak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General supply chain. The Suez shock made it clear we are overly dependent on vulnerable supply routes, and a single boating accident can leave whole continents without supplies for months. We have created a system where if only one single chain breaks, it can mean the end of it. We need redundancy in the system. This means decentralization, having alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy/electricity. As overlord Schwab is predicting, they upcoming cyberpandemic will make Covid19 look like a minor nuisance. We see the script playing out already, with relatively minor attacks on oil and energy suppliers. This is just the prelude. These are the warnings they give us. Like MERS/SARS hoaxes were early predictions/rehearsals of Covid19, the blackouts will hit us hard. My guess we might actually have a Dark Winter, as Biden said. Literally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ALL of the modern issues we face, are related to issues of centralization of power and infrastructure. Decentralization is key to get rid of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need less federal government, we need local decision making, taking into account all the local needs and local assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need less big NGO's/UN-related NGO's telling what to do, we need room for critical thinking, in all areas. We have countless millions of people that are smart and can reason, and weigh benefits and risks, these need to have a voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to decentralize the food supply chain. If all your tomatoes come from Spain, your potatoes from Holland, and the borders are suddenly closed (a surprise lockdown, pAnDeMiC!), where will your food come from? What will you eat when the supermarket is empty? Buy local, eat seasonal foods. Like the old days, prepare jars of pickled food/jams/fruits etc for in the winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need people to pick up farming again, in any scale, small or large. Anyone who knows how to grow food is a value addition for humanity. We need local systems that are centered around protecting the food supply chain, including those building/servicing farming machinery, seed production, and distribution. We need humans to cooperate in new economic models for this, again, decentralized, with new currency methods or even bartering/trading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need people to prepare in general, for disruptions. Not full-scale SHTF scenario style, but at least build buffers in your life, so that you are not in immediate risk if short-term incidents happen. Think about a scenario what you will do when electricity/gas is suddenly shut off in the middle of a cold winter like the last. How are you going to keep your family warm? I bought a gas generator and heat blower for this scenario myself. Have a supply of keepable food stuffs, rice, water, sugar, etc so that in a real bad scenario, you can survive a full month. Think about what this would mean.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need need a different mindset to survive what is coming to us, and to be less affected by the Beast System that is creeping up on all sides. The only solution is local. Start preparing, start farming, even on your balcony. Be a producer, not only a consumer. And get get to know your neighbour, your block, they may your biggest friends in the future. Buy a piece of land, to farm on. Buy a generator. Be more independent. As we humans used to be in the past.</p>
<p>God bless you all, let's hope it won't be as bad as I think it will, but at least be prepared for when it does happen. Change your mindset. Do add more suggestions below if you want to add!</p></p>

        <p>I disagree with that.  By voting, even if the vote is manipulated or ignored, you're using one of the mechanisms available to you to shape the factors that directly affect you.  From a moral standpoint, I can't give that up in good conscience.</p>
<p>Yes, "the system" as a whole certainly appears to be irredeemably corrupt.  But it still functions in the sense that it only takes a few good people to stop evil from winning.  There are still opportunities to do good in positions of power, and that's still worth something.</p>

<p>Haha.</p>
<p>It will go a little left, a little right, but democracy does not change anything of real relevance. All the major agendas continue. Covid19 is the perfect example. All governments are playing along, no matter the color.</p>

        <p>This sub is politics. I hope one day you will get educated about how moderates can use politics to free themselves and take political power away from leftists. Until then, please continue to be a concern troll, but on some other sub. This sub is about action.</p>

        <p>Well said OP. At the start of the pandemic, I decided to learn a new hobby: how to store food for decades. I have hundreds of pounds of long grain white rice sealed and stored in mylar bags, which should last for up to 50 years if I did it properly. It was not expensive, was not hard to learn, and after I stockpiled enough food for my family to survive a bit on our own, it was very rewarding and soothing. Start small, and see how it feels to be a little more prepared than you were yesterday!</p>

        <p>I like the American federal system where there is a central government but individual states have substantial autonomy. Ideally, I would like the whole world to be such a federation (which, being a one world government, is an unpopular opinion on this sub). That way, there would be no war but individual states would still mostly have their own laws. I think it's good that states in America have been able to defy lockdowns and mask mandates from the federal government. And it's also good that they were able to defy Trump when he was in office. The power of central government should be limited whoever is in charge - whether Biden, Trump, or someone else.</p>

        <p>Careful. This is the exact type of rally call that an intelligent bad actor, tyrant wannabe, will use to rally support/power to dismantle society in uncritical way. Just saying this to make sure the actual policy plan they have will will have desired outcome. The fight is between rational/reasonable and irrational/unreasonable, against good and evil - and the issue is the general population isn't educated enough, hasn't critically thought through this holistic system dynamic enough - our immune system is essentially relatively blind, so allowing cancers and viruses to infect us; metaphorically and literally.</p>

        <p>Nobody is talking decentralization, it is all a highway towards the One World Government, One Health Pass, Universal Basic Income, etc. </p>
<p>I think finally a counter message should be brought, against the flood of centralizing forces. </p>
<p>And no, we don't get infected by cancers or viruses, they are the results of toxins, imbalance, within our own bodies, based on what we eat, how well we sleep, fear etc. Viruses are just our own exosomes, cleaning up the mess for you. The real virus is fear.</p>
