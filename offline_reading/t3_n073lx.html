    <strong>What if we were the brainwashed sheep?</strong>
    <p><p>Wouldn’t that be crazy. We just kept running into all of this “fake news” that social media was trying to rid of for the sake of our mental health. Everything we saw on the news actually was real but we were too brainwashed to see it. Covid was really killing millions of people. Corporations and politicians really did love us.</p></p>

        <p>Who is it that is washing our brains? Because in the opposite view it's the you-know-who who pressure-washes everybody.</p>

        <p>The problem with that theory is every one of us is likely a pariah, who has suffered great personal and professional harm to say and believe things the way we do.</p>
<p>If we were brainwashed, we'd probably be brainwashed into compliance with the majority.  That's the purpose of brain washing.</p>
<p>But we're clearly not in the majority.  It would therefore stand to reason we're not the ones who are brainwashed.</p>

        <p>I mean I don’t doubt that Covid is a pandemic, but the response was not proportional. The actual question is what would be the benefit of brainwashing us. Look who has power. Name one institution that would benefit.  education, healthcare, media, Hollywood, sports, corporations, politicians. There’s a clear reason for each of these people to brainwash. </p>
<p>The higher education elites- are made up of mostly far left to moderate left people who want socialism, this can be done by getting more people on the government teet.</p>
<p>Healthcare- namely Fauci and the lot, this is the first time they have real political power and they are using it.</p>
<p>Media- make money off of fear and hate, some are ideologues with socialistic motivations but most are opportunists. Look at the Covid coverage % positive versus negative coverage in the US versus the world.</p>
<p>Hollywood- these are mostly profit seeking people looking to forward their careers by being woke.</p>
<p>Sports- they are profit seeking </p>
<p>Corps- profit seeking (look at stock prices during pandemic)</p>
<p>Politicians- they are the same as the media except add power.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong on the right or anti-lockdown crowd there are grifters and opportunists, specifically the people who think no one should be vaccinated as well but their agenda would be what exactly, let people do what they want. Don’t force people to do things. I mean if they are brainwashing us there is no real direction, seeing as most people against the new normal are anti-authority by default rather than a coherent ideology. You will find libertarian left, libertarian right, neocons, neoliberals.</p>

        <p>Definitely. My point being that all of that sounds completely ridiculous.</p>
