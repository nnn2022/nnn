    <strong>Can't get drs appointments in the UK at the moment without waiting weeks to see a doctor. Same with dentists. Thanks to covid.</strong>
    <p><p>The backlog of surgeries and treatments due to covid delays is so bad you can't even book to see a gp without there being a 3-4 week wait. </p>
<p>Heck, I need my ears suctioned and the wait time for that is 4 weeks and that's private. I'm having to be partially deaf for 4 weeks. You can't even get an appointment for the doctor at the moment. You call at 8am and ask what appointments are available for the day and there's none by 8:01am. And they don't let you book in advance. </p>
<p>My mum is working for NHS dental call line and there are people suffering with infected cavities because they can't book a dental appointment because there are none to be had. </p>
<p>Covid (whether you think it's real or not) has destroyed the NHS yet people are aggressively defending it. It is not fit for purpose. </p>
<p>And thanks to covid people are dying from preventable illnesses and from not getting cancer treatments. People are having to suffer and live with suffering. </p>
<p>And they're not being held accountable. No one is and it makes me so damn angry. </p>
<p>Better hope your not seriously sick at the moment because you're fucked if you are. </p>
<p>It's absolutely appalling. And believe me, I've used our NHS a LOT in my life with various illnesses and surgeries. I think it WAS great. But now it's just fallen apart. There needs to be something, some other option. Maybe make large corporations give their employees private healthcare insurance as a standard. Idk. </p>
<p>Its just frustrating. I'm lucky it's just that I can't hear and not something more sinister.</p></p>

        <p>Before covid you could at least book a same day drs appointment. </p>
<p>Before covid you could book a dentist appointment. </p>
<p>Usually it was only surgery wait times, A&amp;E wait times and mental health counseling wait times. </p>
<p>Now the problem is even worse. You basically can't get basic care. You can't book to see a Dr if you need it. And now millions of cancer patients have had their treatments put on hold. Like, yes it was bad. But at least you could see someone. </p>
<p>Now it's even worse than it was. What's the point in having public healthcare if you can't see someone when things go wrong. Even the private sector has a backlog because people are going private because they're that desperate.</p>

        <p>Didn't know y'all even had the option of private health care.</p>
<p>Knew a guy online one time that couldn't get an appointment for a month or two to get his asthma inhaler prescription refilled, so he ended up having to have an attack and an emergency room visit to get it.</p>

        <p>Yes there is private healthcare in the UK. It's just no one sees fit to use it most of the time. 
The healthiest group of people are aged 18-49 and it's unlikely most working people will need to use the NHS services that much compared to other age groups. They're also the group that can afford it as they're working. </p>
<p>Some companies provide health insurance as part of their package. My partner's for example does this. So I'm on his insurance package because at this point why bother with the NHS. </p>
<p>Before covid it took years to get surgery I needed to improve quality of life. Constantly being ping ponged between different doctors who all just repeatedly prescribed antibiotics. </p>
<p>Like I think the emergency care is great when it works. But it's beyond repair right now and we can afford to pay a small fee monthly to get private insurance. But it looks like a lot of people have done the same. Hence the backlog. </p>
<p>The NHS often sends patients to private hospitals too when their hospitals are too full for surgeries as well as most private hospitals are under used.</p>

        <p>That paired with the NHS would act as a kind of health tax on corporations too</p>
