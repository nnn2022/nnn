    <strong>Worst case scenario for unvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>What do you guys think is the worst case scenario for those unvaccinated? They are slowly but surely removing the rights of people who wouldn't take the jab. No travel, no pub entry etc. Of course, it varies from country to country at the moment, but I don't think it's going to get any better for those of us who refuse to get vaccinated. They are ruthless, extremely determined and they're moving fast. It's astonishing actually.. .</p>
<p>I can put up without pubs or travel etc., but what happens when you can't even get a job unless you're jabbed?  I think this would be it... What do you do then? I have a feeling that they will start blaming the unvaccinated for all the new variants and hence new lockdowns and we will have the society turned against us. We are already being dehumanized and called "plague rats", "anti-vaxxers", "variant factories"... (where have we seen this before I wonder?). I think there will come a point where being unvaccinated will be illegal and extremely socially unacceptable.</p>
<p>Do any of you have a back up plan if it actually comes to this? I don't think we are far off. Is there a country that we could escape to? Leave the civilized world and move to the mountains? Create our own society :)?... I definitely don't think there will be any real or impactful resistance from the general public. The majority will roll over and accept it, just like they accepted face masks, vaccines and never ending restrictions. Also, we are being highly outnumbered, decentralized... the odds are against us.</p></p>

        <p>Do some more research, friend. Only 43% of the US is vaccinated and the rate is slowing exponentially.  So... no, we are not outnumbered yet. Most businesses wont/ dont care if it cuts into thier profits . Those businesses that require vaccinations are failing, quickly. In 2-3 years most vaccinated will be dead,  so....</p>

        <p>Of course we're being outnumbered, and I am not necessarily talking about vaccine rates, which btw will continue to grow across the globe.. Just look around you, how many of your friends and family share the same strong views as you do? Some may sympathize, but most people think this is a legit health crisis and we have a benign government trying to manage it. </p>
<p>We are fairly loud on the internet, which can give you a false impression that there is a lot of people who share your views, but in reality the majority of people are mindless drones.</p>

        <p>Do you openly share your stance with friends and family? I share my true feelings on this matter with maybe 3 people, that’s it. So I wouldn’t be surprised if many people I know feel the same way and won’t share it. Less than half the country is fully vaccinated, and there is a large silent majority that somehow got trump elected despite all the odds.</p>
<p>Trust me, there’s a lot of people that feel to some degree, the same way we do here.</p>

        <p>Support for Trump doesn't necessarily equate to having the same views as we do over here, though it's way more likely. I can't imagine a Biden supporter being against government overreach and lockdowns. </p>
<p>The problem is that most people will crumble, even if they don't support mandatory jabs, lockdowns etc. When push comes to shove, most are likely to take the jab regardless of how they actually feel and hope for the best. They will give in to peer pressure etc.. Maybe 10% will refuse and fight til the end, if we're lucky. </p>
<p>I know I sound very grim and pessimistic, but the last 16 months hasn't necessarily inspired a lot of confidence in the society</p>

        <p>There is one factor that helps us: the majority of unvaxxed people I know (me included) are well-armed. ‘They’ know this, and don’t want to provoke us. Completely dehumanizing that many people by making us all unemployed overnight would result in a large-scale revolt, and quickly. Even some of the vaxxed people are starting to experience ‘vaccine regret’ as some have had health issues and after-effects directly related to the shots. Pregnant women that are vaccinated are miscarrying at an alarming rate. Eventually, the media is going to flip on everything. They’ll go from ‘get your shots’ to ‘is the vaccine killing us?’</p>

        <p>My grandparents always seemed goofy to me because the always have a huge supply of food and essentials. They are always working on their secondary property way out in the woods and have been building up their infrastructure there with sheds and buildings. My grandfather purchases a backhoe and as a kid i was thinking “how strange”. They always talked about being ready and not being to crazy about it. Telling me my parents baby me and that i have no life skills or knowledge. Over the years I paid attention and thought they were weird and slowly came go their side. in 2018 I began my prepping and back up plans as well and learning bushcrafting skills and being ready to live in the wild. I choose not to disappear yet because I have hope and the will power to show others they have been lied to. Giving up on everyone else is unthinkable. I’m not scared of the powers to be and not scared of getting held down and vaxxed or killed. That’s what it takes and what it means to be free or die trying.</p>

        <p>Who cares about the odds. When the fight for freedom arises, it is do or die trying. Stop talking about the odds and toughen up. You have potential and free will. Figure out either how to survive or how to show the truth. Stop worrying about the life you had or want with certain people. They need more time or it’s too late for them anyways. </p>
