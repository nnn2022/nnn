    <strong>Working in a School Age Daycare</strong>
    <p><p>All the local school districts are doing hybrid school, so I'm working at a daycare where kids can come on the days that they're not in school.  So far it's absolutely awful.</p>
<p>First of all, we barely have any kids anymore.  Before the pandemic we had a roster of about 75 kids, with 35-40 there at any one time.  Now we're lucky if we hit 15 kids on any given day.  There are a lot of kids that I haven't seen since March that I miss a lot, and I don't think I have any hope of seeing them again any time soon.</p>
<p>Corporate has given us a schedule that they expect us to follow.  They've given us four different kinds of activities to plan, the descriptions of which are filled with nothing but meaningless educational buzzwords/jargon, so I still have no idea what they're supposed to be.  Oh, but every kids has a different schedule for their "online school" so how tf are we supposed to follow that schedule anyway? And we're supposed to somehow keep track of what every single kid's online schedule is.</p>
<p>We have one kids who's doing fully remote school (don't ask me why his mom took the fully remote option when she's just sending him to daycare anyway, it doesn't make any sense to me either) and he constantly refuses to do any of his online work because he just wants to play while he's at daycare.  He would probably benefit from being in an actual school, but that's just me.</p>
<p>Last year, I would work at this daycare before and after school while substituting at the public schools during the day.  Now I'm giving up the chance to substitute because I need to be there all day now that kids are only in school two days a week.  I could make more money if I quit and started substituting full time, but then I run the risk of the schools getting switched to fully remote, and then I'll be SOOL because I won't be an online substitute.</p>
<p>My boss says he thinks this is going to last the whole school year.  I really wish I could just get knocked into a coma until this is all over.</p></p>
