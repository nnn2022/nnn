    <strong>Canadian military wants to establish new organization to use propaganda, other techniques to influence Canadians</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/canadian-military-to-establish-new-organization-to-use-propaganda-other-techniques-to-influence-canadians">https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/canadian-military-to-establish-new-organization-to-use-propaganda-other-techniques-to-influence-canadians</a> </p>
<p>The Canadian Forces wants to establish a new organization that will use propaganda and other techniques to try to influence the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of Canadians, according to documents obtained by this newspaper.</p>
<p>The plan comes on the heels of the Canadian Forces spending more than $1 million to train public affairs officers on behaviour modification techniques of the same sort used by the parent firm of Cambridge Analytica, as well as a controversial and bizarre propaganda training mission in which the military forged letters from the Nova Scotia government to <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/forged-letter-warning-about-wolves-on-the-loose-part-of-canadian-forces-propaganda-campaign-that-went-awry">warn the public that wolves were wandering in the province</a>.</p>
<p>The new Defence Strategic Communication group will advance “national interests by using defence activities to influence the attitudes, beliefs and behaviours of audiences,” according to the document dated October 2020. Target audiences for such an initiative would be the Canadian public as well as foreign populations in countries where military forces are sent.</p></p>

        <p>Canada is quickly turning into a communist country. We have 3 more years with Trudeau. He’s already a traitor to the country, he’s following suit with European countries and I expect strict lockdowns in Canada and for military personnel to be deployed at major centres and set up check points. The “Quarantine ACT 2005” Gives the the minister scary amounts of power during pandemics. We’ve got limited free speech and very strict gun laws.</p>

        <p>Yes, Trudeau is the worst thing to have ever happened to this country. He's definitely trying his best to get socialism as the economic model in Canada and absolutely wreck the Canadian economy... Steadily keep bankrupting small to medium sized businesses, make UBI/CRB permanent and voila! Coup accomplished. </p>
<p>Scary thing is, the NDP is surging across Canada, they won by a serious margin in BC... The economic plan this bozo and his cabinet are bringing into play is a complete disaster for this country, and now ideologically, he went off the deep end as well... He's bringing his "green" bullshit that the deep state in Geneva told him to push into Canada. With the far left NDP siding with him on these agendas, what ever dystopian shit he wants to pass will pass for the remainder of his tenure. </p>
<p>You can almost say Canadians have become quite dumb, or the propaganda is working quite well. The far left and the "green" economic scams are at it's highest approval ever in Canada.</p>

        <p>Well that coincides perfectly with the 'great' Catherine McKenna's philosophy: <em>"But you know, I actually gave them some real advice. I said that if you actually say it louder, we’ve learned in the House of Commons, if you repeat it, if you say it louder, if that is your talking point, people will totally believe it"</em></p>
<p>Then she got caught saying that on camera: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab_RHs562DQ</p>

        <p>I recently saw these RFP postings from Vancouver, looking for help in behavioral change campaigns, and in relation to sustainability.
