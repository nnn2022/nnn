<p>I’m not even right wing at all. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary last year for fucks sake and worked for Obama’s campaign in college</p>

        <p>I'm sure if you took a poll on this sub political identification would be all over the map. I'm also sure nearly all of us don't agree with either major party - but that's the only viable choice we are given. Very strange, as if it was designed to keep us powerless and at each other's throats.</p>

        <p>Agreed. </p>
<p>I’m an “old school” liberal, (as in I think things like gay marriage and marijuana should be legal, and I am ok with some social programs) but I don’t care what other people’s political views are. I have friends and family ranging from very liberal to very conservative and I get along with all of them. I hate how politics has been weaponized to divide people, and that people actually fall for it.</p>
<p>My mom is a Democrat and voted for Biden but she’s very against getting the vaccine and so are most of her friends. It’s not a political thing.</p>

        <p>I'm a lot like you except I label myself libertarian and I always voted Republican, even for Trump. I'm anti-Marxist, but I get why Bernie appeals to a lot of people. I even met him when he was mayor of Burlington at reggae-fest there! I have friends of all political stripes and respect people with different views and their right to have them. I didn't vote for Obama, but I was proud we elected a black president. Wish it was Thomas Sowell or Candace Owens but hey. My daughter is lesbian and been with her partner for years and I'm 100% cool with that, in fact I'm proud. I believe in the Constitution and freedom and that weed should be legal. I also believe we should have safety nets but not disincentives to work. And we should enforce our border laws and people should be able to come here legally and work and become citizens. And everyone should be able to make their own choices and take their own risks and live as they wish as long as it doesn't harm others. And that's what the pandemic virus industrial complex is doing right now - using propoganda to brainwash people that they are being harmed by the unvaccinated. That's why I'm here, with people like you who might have some reasonable disagreements with me politically but whose eyes are wide open about what's really happening. We know who the real enemy is and which direction the bullets are coming from. I'm honored to be in this foxhole with you.</p>

        <p>I completely and absolutely agree. Psilocybin mushrooms have helped me immensely to get over depression and anxiety. I think a lot of people could benefit from them, but of course big pharma doesn’t want that because they want you buying <em>their</em> shit drugs.</p>
<p>Even if someone is addicted to hard drugs, like meth or heroin, possessing them should not be a criminal offense that can get them thrown in jail.</p>

        <p>It’s their way of branding anyone who won’t go along with the program or questions the narrative.</p>
<p>Some PR douchebag did a focus group a decade ago and found out that “far right” and “alt right” sounded scary to the sheeple so they started to use it to brand things to scare sheeple.</p>

        <p>It's also part of the decade-long campaign of making <em>anything at all</em> branded "right-wing" to be considered bad, and thus anyone who considers themselves to be right-wing (and anyone labeled as such) to be evil. You already see it in the disdain the media has for anything right-wing. If they consider it bad, they label it 'right-wing' and they only associate good things with the left, while sweeping away any of their bad.</p>
