        <p>And how the CDC changed their guidelines on how to Report deaths on March 24th, 2020. The previous guideline, which had been in place for the previous 17 years would have recorded 9684 deaths, while the new guidelines recorded 161,392 deaths for the same period of time</p>

        <p>Which is a distinct possibility - pretend COVID doesn't exist, and we call it a severe flu season. Would it result in a 30% increase in deaths though; that's bloody significant.</p>
<p>It's going to hit the weak/elderly much harder, but the balancing act should be the following year - presumably a less virulent season, but also a hardier remaining population which won't be impacted as much.</p>

        <p>And how many deaths in 2019? 2018? Compare how manny flu deaths there were in the previous years. From what I have heard and read, the flu season for the few previous years has been very mild and less deaths. Which means, all those people who would have died to the flu in 2017, 2018, 2019 but didn't because the flu was mild, brought those years death count down. But then when the next flu season comes/covid, all those people that would have died would have had no chance of surviving this year. I know that's true in my country but I haven't looked at numbers across the world. But look into that. </p>
<p>So, yes, you're right. An increase in deaths is tragic, especially a significant increase, but you can't just look at that one year. You have to compare to previous years and compare to future years (when the data comes). </p>
<p>And lastly, it is super important to report deaths properly otherwise it gives governments emergency powers, like we have seen across the world, to do whatever they want without any opposition. In Canada, we finally have some MP ( members of parliament) speaking up about these emergency powers and how they have been able to put in place laws that have nothing to do with covid, into place while they have emergency powers and don't have to go through the regular process.</p>
<p>And also, this doesn't touch on an increase in deaths from other sources due to lockdowns. Suicides and drug overdoses (opioid crisis) are rampart in a lot of countries across the world.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what I'm asking.</p>
<p>I had COVID, it was like a mild flu, I don't want the vaccine, but will probably have to for travel reasons.</p>
<p>I cannot reconcile the global response to this virus (after the initial worry over \~15% mortality rate from Italy) given that it seems to be no where near as bad as we first thought.</p>
<p>The only thing which makes me still question it is the fact that a lot of nations appear to have significant excess mortality rates for 2020 (or it is way worse than we're being told, and we'll all be fucked in a few years anyway).</p>
<p>As I said, Poland averaged 400,000 per year over the 5 years before 2020, which then spike to 520,000.</p>
<p>That is a bloody significant increase; and is the only thing making me not write COVID off as complete and utter bullshit (which I'm close to doing, anyway).</p>

        <p>In due time we will find out. Governments overreached on their powers based on what happened in Italy. There will be investigations into this for decades and we may not know the final outcome for a long time. </p>
<p>For me, there's just too many inconsistencies. Initially, I was all for abiding by regulations and social distancing and everything. But as I started to look more into it the more it didn't make sense. Back in March 2020 the medical professionals in my country stated that the death rate was such and such. That was based off of the known cases. But then they went and said there are 3-10 times MORE cases out in the community than they are aware of. Well, then we can't assume the deathrate is so high if you are saying the cases could be 3-10 times higher. That pushed the deathrate down to something like 0.00095 (don't remember exact figure). And that was just looking at the population as a whole, not looking at specific age groups.</p>
<p>Then the whole PCR test. It was never designed to be a diagnostic tool. It also can't distinguish between different corona viruses. On top of that, above 35 ct the test has a 95% chance of a false positive. My province has stated numerous times it is running, on average, 40 ct. </p>
<p>Then the whole outdoor transmission thing hit. Premier of Ontario shutdown parks. He had so much backlash that he reversed it less than 24 hours later. If there was scientific data to show that transmissions were happening at parks then the restriction shouldn't have been reversed, but because it was reversed, so easily, it means my government has been imposing restrictions that aren't based off of science. And to double down on this they did it again a couple weeks later with splash pads. Reversed again within 24 hours. </p>
<p>None of it makes sense.</p>

        <p>Agreed. And now with how much the US is pushing this vaccine? It doesn't add up. Insulin, in the US, costs 10 times more than what it costs to make, Cancer drugs cost 10,000/month. But this vaccine? Not only is it free, they are offering free shit to if you get it. Free burgers, free ice cream, free flights even. And what my province is doing is even more despicable. We set up a pop-up clinic that will give the vaccine to anyone 12 years and up...no parental permission required...and the kid gets free ice cream. It's sickening. Those kids, who we don't even give them authority to vote, drive or drink alcohol, are being coerced into getting a vaccine that we don't know enough about.</p>

        <p>It'd be nice to see this normalized for population growth. Likely the rates would show even more disparity. Would love to see this broken down into categories too, like deaths caused by accidents</p>
