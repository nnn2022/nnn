    <strong>Lockdowns will be known as the ultimate example of Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong>
    <p><p>Memories these three words: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost">Sunk Cost Fallacy</a>. This is what's happening, <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanSchachtel/status/1353554542730883072">as speculated by a verified acct on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The lockdowns and fear porn have been so extreme, and there has been so much time, money, and emotions invested in the world's biggest PSA/social activism campaign, nobody wants to be the first to admit that <em>maybe it was all for nothing.</em> </p>
<p>This is why they continue to double down. I agree some aspects of it are Orwellian and we should start asking some very valid questions, but the simplest explanation is that after creating what's essentially a cottage industry of PPE, fear porn in the media, and PSA's, there is no option to kill it overnight. <em>They have sunk too many resources into it to abandon the project without some sort of tangible return.</em></p>
<p>So they simply perpetuate it.</p>
<p>It's a bit like the losers who have invested thousands into Star Citizen. Rather than realize they've been duped, cut their losses and find something else to do, they continue to stick around and become even more fanatical about the game.</p></p>
