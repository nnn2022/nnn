    <strong>Is there an antibody test for Covid where you don't have to get the q tip on the brain?</strong>
    <p><p>I wonder if I could get an antibody test for Covid so I can rejoin society with less fear. I am high risk and wear the masks. I got very sick in Feb of 2020, I got this very high fever one day [104], and remember thinking I am going to die unless I fight this shit off, so I went to my bed and fought off whatever it was. I felt really bad for that brief time like the Grim Reaper was standing over me. Covid hadn't even been admitted yet as hitting America.</p>
<p>Now I can get sick like this from other conditions, so it's complicated and I could be wrong. I do however wonder why I have not died of Covid yet, because I am high risk. I wear masks, but I futzed around going outside constantly even during my states hardest core lockdown though I have been kind of socially isolated, my apartment hallways are full of people some unmasked and I never washed groceries or boxes or any of that crap.</p>
<p>If I found out I had antibodies to it, then I could walk around with a lot more ease. I do not want the test where they shove the q tip into your brain so tell me how is this done. Can they test the blood. Where would I go to get such a test?</p></p>

        <p>i’m pretty sure you can get blood work done. i’m almost 100% positive you have t and b cell memory and could produce antibodies to fight off infection when needed. i wouldn’t worry if i were you. ingest 5000 IU vit d and some K2 for absorption. eat a balanced diet.</p>
<p>masks dont do much at all.</p>
<p>when you say you’re at high risk, what do you mean? is it something out of your control?</p>

        <p>I could ask doctor for blood work too. I take 50,000 units of Vit D a week for being low on Vit D. I have lung problems [COPD--never smoked] and vast array of autoimmune and other issues and am disabled. When I had the fever, no other symptoms came. It could have been fighting off an infection I get from another condition but I remember how horrible I felt it was worse then usual but the next morning I was fine and there were no other symptoms.</p>

<p>again, i think this will only confirm that you have natural immunity and will be fine. </p>
<p>fever was your body dealing with the sickness - you did well! </p>
<p>try not to worry too much, it’s bad for your immunity</p>

        <p>First of all I just want to ask you is this a real question? Or are you trolling us.  Either is fine just wanna know :) </p>
<p>To answer your question I’ll say this.  IF Covid-19 is real and not just the Flu rebranded, you absolutely had it in February 2020 of you got sick.  There’s evidence that Covid was circulating in North America as early as November 2019 and me personally I remember everyone at my work getting sick as dogs and then myself too in January 2020 but “Covid hadn’t landed yet”.  In my opinion everyone or mostly everyone who got sick in late 2019 or early 2020 it was what they are calling Covid-19.  </p>
<p>You haven’t died from Covid yet because they are simply lying about how deadly it is.  Highly Infectious, yes.  Highly lethal? Absolutely not.  Even if you look at the official numbers from the CDC and the WHO and places like this which are notorious for inflating numbers due to the fraudulent PCR test and testing bodies post mortem for Covid no matter what the cause of death was (car crash, heart attack, suicide etc.) you’ll see that Covid-19 is essentially right on par for being as lethal as the yearly flu if not less lethal.  The world death counter actually counted less deaths in 2020 than in 2019.  Sounds like a real deadly pandemic to me, let’s not talk to the Black Plague which wiped out 50% of Europe and had roughly a 50% mortality rate instead of 0.07% or whatever the “official” numbers say Covid is.  </p>
<p>In my personal opinion I would stay far away from everything to do with Covid testing.  The PCR test is completely fraudulent, the rapid Antigen test is nothing more than a joke, I mean a papaya, a can of Pepsi, and multiple other non-living objects have tested positive for Covid with that test.  There is evidence that the PCR test they are administering has been contaminated with Covid and multiple other things too.  I’d stay the fuck away from them if I were you.  Masks as well, if you want to wear a mask that is your choice and power to you but I hope you’re not wearing the disposable blue ones, they’ve been proven to have cancer causing chemicals in them and not to mention just think about the dirty sweat shops they are produced in.  Sterile? Not likely.  </p>
<p>My advice to you friend would be to take off the mask, don’t worry about the endless fear mongering and safety culture that the world has fallen in to.  Life is short and living life in a padded cell is no life at all.  Get outside and exercise, take vitamins, breath beautiful clean oxygen and do your best to not be stressed out! Stress is a way bigger killer than Covid ever could be.</p>

        <p>I'm not trolling, it's kind of a question with reservations because I think the Covid narrative is full of a lot of BS. I don't want the q tip test, I am against that. I just want the worry and fear taken off me. I want to rejoin society and did start going back in stores, but husband is afraid for us. He is convinced of the dangerousness of the vaxx, but I thought this could ease his mind too. Some of my groups are starting to meet in person. I am worried about vaxx shedding but at a certain point I will want to join them.</p>
<p>I heard of people getting sick too in Nov and Feb. In my case I don't know if this was my other medical condition acting up or was something else. I figure if I found out I had antibiodies--how come the jerks aren't testing people for antibodies before they force the vaxx on them? I always thought that was a hole in things. I am surprised I haven't gotten it yet, we have maskless neighbors in here, probably some secret no new normal people around me.
early 2020 it was what they are calling Covid-19. I have wondered if we are both asymptomatic.
I do agree with you the PCR test is fraudulent, definitely, around here they seemed to scoop up everyone with the sniffles into the Covid net.</p>
<p>I know I am worried about lying bogus tests too or them even poisoning me with something, like on the q tips.
I remember reading about rapid antigen tests, and the papayas, wasn't that the president of Tansmania?</p>
<p>I have been wearing KN95 but I wear masks for as short period of time as possible. I hate them and they are hard to breathe in. I am in a hard core lock down state.</p>
<p>I agree about stress. I still have to find some real world people to hang out with who aren't fooled by all this stuff. I am losing friends all over the few I told what I think.</p>

        <p>I totally feel you in the losing friends, I’ve honestly been unable to contact my entire family and most of my friends because they are such hard core doomers that if you even begin to talk about how Covid has been politicized and used for governments to gain unheard of levels of power and control they just shut down immediately.  </p>
<p>Speaking to you wondering if you were both asymptomatic, I can try to find you the articles but as far as my research has gone asymptomatic spread has been completely debunked by virologists and scientists alike.  Asymptomatic = healthy and even if someone is carrying a virus asymptomatically they say that it’s next to impossible to transmit the virus to someone else so don’t worry about any of that nonsense! </p>
<p>Totally was president Mugafuli of Tanzania...he’s dead now tho :( I think they probably took him out for openly mocking the Covid nonsense narrative but who knows really.  </p>
<p>I’ve seen articles written about how they developed nano bot technology that administers small doses of a drug every now and again but the way they deliver this nano bot into your body is from a very long  Q tip up the nose.  The article was released long before Covid existed too, take that with as many grains of salt as you like haha I’m gonna stay away from those no matter what.  Your husband is dead on about the Vaccines as well, I’ve seen enough doctors and scientists get deplatformed for saying the “vaccines” are actually bioweapons made for depopulation and reducing fertility to know to stay far away from them too.  </p>
<p>Speaking to Vaxx shedding, I was really worried about that too for a while.  Granted we still know very very little about this subject but the scientific consensus in the now alternative (lol) scientific community as of writing this is that the vaccinated people will shed the Covid spike proteins through skin to skin contact  and through bodily fluids but not through the air.  To get vaccine shed upon you’ll have to be making out or having sex with someone, not just standing near them.  I really hope this is true because GMO people spreading  GMO Viruses all over the place scares the hell out of me! </p>
<p>I don’t think I can answer your question about getting confirmation about Covid antibodies, i really don’t know of any legitimate system to do with Covid that could give you any sort of believable answer that doesn’t also expose you to really nefarious and possibly harmful people and tests.  A friend of mine got put in Canadian Covid jail (“quarantine hotel”) and they kept her there for 3 weeks despite a negative pcr test every day and multiple other highly intrusive tests and interrogations, but they essentially just kept her there as long as they liked no matter what she did or however many negative tests she produced.  Scary stuff.  I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful on that front tho :)</p>

        <p>I have a very similar timeline to you, and have also been holed up mostly in my house similar to you.  I caught the actual flu in December of 2019, then got really, really sick again in Feb / Mar 2020.  Sick for several days, felt a little better for a few days, then sick again.  All virus, as there was no evidence of any bacterial infection.  At that point, Covid was just starting to make news, bu there were no tests.  I assume I had Covid.</p>
<p>Flash forward to last Friday, I  gave blood, and they tested for Covid antibodies.  A few days later I got the results, no detection.  Bummer, because I am getting pressured to get vaccinated from various areas of my life, and really wanted that antibody test.  And since I had such a severe case, the current vaccines could cause a severe adverse reaction for me. <br>
 However, I recently read that while antibodies may not last in your blood for that long, they can still be present in your body.  And you can still have natural immunity.</p>
<p>So now, I am doing three things:</p>
<p>1) researching T-cell immunity test.  haven't found out much about it yet</p>
<p>2) really trying to do everything possible to strengthn my immune system - D, C, exercise, quercitin, etc.</p>
<p>3) trying to wait out the intense pressure, for a vaccine that is more traditional (Novavax is supposed to come out soon)</p>
<p>Good luck to you!!</p>

        <p>You can get an IgG test that will show if you had COVID. If I remember right, the IgM results would show if you do have COVID, but for whatever reason, I haven't heard of an IgM test. When I did the IgG test, it had no IgM results in it.</p>
