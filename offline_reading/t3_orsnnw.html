    <strong>Pharmaphiles</strong>
    <p><p>I don't comment much on reddit and usually lurk following back and forth conversations but, I think I have the best thing you could use instead of "pro-vaxxer" (considering most people I've seen are fine with the old school type of vaccine). Pharmaphiles, the people who allow no questioning of the Pharmaceutical industry when it comes to this vax and/or anything else you may question big pharma about (like say insulin pricing for example), well I think we should start using the term Pharmaphiles. It's catchy and rolls of the tongue very easily.</p>
<p>As I said, this term should extend beyond this current mRNA vaccine issue, it should apply to anyone that is not entirely open and accepting of others asking pharmalogical questions (regardless of the askers knowledge level). I'm not saying anyone who is able to answer said questions must sit there and explain everything to anyone, I am saying that if you cannot answer the questions thoroughly yet still think it is wrong to ask said questions, you are a pharmaphile. If you can only disagree yet not actually disprove someone's concerns about something within the realm of human health and medicine, and you want to say that for others to see, read, or respond to that person's concerns and/or questions is wrong, you are a pharmaphile.</p>
<p>Let those who truly want to be "fact-checkers" actually discuss science and not fall under the lemmings who would be labeled pharmaphiles (those who only follow what they've been told, they have very little understanding of the topics they don't want you to discuss). Those who don't, those who can't actually support or even prove their arguments, well they can be labeled pharmaphiles and be much easier to dismiss.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you need to publish a paper not to be a pharmaphile but, you must be able to have a discussion with legitimate back and forth with whoever it is you disagree with. You must be able to acknowledge those situations in which you can't actually disprove the person (most likely due to lack of data/information/knowledge) although you think they are wrong in their assertion, and then be able to accept that it is a disagreement due to different perspectives based on life experience and knowledge level.</p>
<p>We must not allow the anti scientific rhetoric, which falls in line with a near worship and almost total belief in scientists opinions, go on to squash any further debates about science. We as a society must have these discussions be incredibly thorough and open. In my opinion, it would also benefit us to shine a light on disagreements and come to a conclusion whether or not a dissenter to the prevailing scientific consensus is only in disagreement or if they truly are ignoring nearly-proven and repeatable science.</p>
