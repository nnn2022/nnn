    <strong>Unvaccinated &amp; drastic cycle changes?</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen multiple posts throughout the past few months about people who have not been vaccinated having changes in their menstrual cycles. Now I have been dealing with it. I thought I was going to start mine about 4-5 weeks ago, and I've been cramping/sore breasts for weeks and I've had all the symptoms like I'm gonna start but I just don't. I know it's highly unlikely that I'm pregnant either as I haven't been very sexually active. Actually my libido seems to be way lower than normal too! It's weird.</p>
<p>I have not been more stressed than usual, actually I've been far less stressed than I've been in a while. But I've been working with people that are primarily all vaccinated so I wonder if that's having an impact on my cycle somehow.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this? thanks!</p></p>

        <p>I've been hearing this from people around me. It is happening to people who have close extended contact with the vaccinated. Working with vaccinated people in tight quarters is most likely your culprit.</p>

        <p>I have had direct contact with someone who's had the mRNA shot for a few weeks now and have had some odd symptoms. The most apparent has been blurry and poorly focused vision that starts almost exactly two hours after exposure ceases. The next most apparent is bloody noses. The only time I had bloody noses of this type was when I <em>had covid.</em> Then I've had an occasional dry cough but I also vape and work in dusty environments so I can't tell if it's related.</p>
<p>Not to toot my own horn but I called a lot of this shit months ago, spike shedding, mRNA prions, etc. The covid mRNA cocktail is transmissible. I only hope that the shed proteins are generally destroyed by the immune system immediately and hope that the mRNA itself isn't shed.</p>

        <p>My father was vaccinated in mid December (he‚Äôs a healthcare worker). Skipped my period in January, had one in February, then beginning in March I began to spot between periods. I thought it was just ovulation bleeding, but it has persisted, and I also am on my period again despite having had it 2 weeks ago. Needless to say I am concerned. Going to the doctor this week to see if there‚Äôs something causing this; if she can‚Äôt find anything, I know it‚Äôs from being around the damn vaccine</p>

        <p>&rt;unless you count 5 days a week at the gym</p>
<p>Yes, I'd say this counts big time.  Id imagine that people shed spike at the gym big time.  The same way they claimed cOviD could spread there.</p>

        <p>Here, read this:
https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmfvpe/i_think_the_shot_causes_people_to_shed_something/gzokeyj/</p>
<p>I have other info, but short on time at the moment. All I can say is that unvaccinated women have had a plethora of weird and mostly painful experiences with their menstrual cycles when they have had contact with vaccinated women. Some work in health care who have to take care of vaccinated patients, some live with family vaccinated members, and some have vaccinated friends who they meet on occasion.</p>
<p>I have even heard unvaccinated men getting sick or nausea from being around vaccinated men or women. </p>
<p>It might be due to how vaccinated people are shedding the viral spike protein through breath (water vapour) or physical touch (sweat glands). </p>
<p>If possible, stay as far away from vaccinated people. If you can‚Äôt avoid them then there‚Äôs not much that can be done. ‚òπÔ∏èüò¢üòî</p>

        <p>There were frontline doctors talking about this on twitter but of course they were all suspended, for talking about their own experience.  She thought that 2-3 weeks after vax the spike proteins are being emitted and can affect other people if in close contact.</p>

<p>I'm convinced there's something going on. Whether it's vaxx-caused, or covid-caused, something isn't right. No way this is all a coincidence.</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs heartbreaking. I just know something is wrong. It took no time to get pregnant the first time and I‚Äôm in 0 categories for high risk. And I know 20% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, statistically, but something just feels amiss.</p>

        <p>I have. Spotting in between periods, and this one came a week early. Mine has always been regular.</p>

        <p>My hairdresser got the vax. So now I'm gonna start marking my period on calendar as well as my eyelash and hair appointments and any other appointments where I'm in close contact and see if my period is affected. I might have to change the people I see. Unfortunately I don't know eyelash lady well enough to ask her if she is vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I spent two weekends back to back in April when I got back home I got my period and I was shedding chunks of clots that I haven't seen since puberty. I'm 38. That is not a normal period for me. Didn't know if there is any correlation but I found it a bit unnerving.</p>

        <p>This is something strange. Hung out with a friend who recently got vaccinated (like two weeks ago) and I didn‚Äôt know. That night of maybe 8-10 hours of hanging out my breasts were sore as well as my Lower back usually indicating me getting my period. Checked my calendar and I wasn‚Äôt due for about another two weeks. Over the next couple days things seemed to level out but I wonder if I would have gotten my period early if I had more contact. None of my family are vaccinated and I‚Äôm not super super close to any coworkers at work so I wonder..</p>

        <p>Yes, I believe it could be possible.  I have been following all of the covid subs and comment sections very closely and can attest that I have seen this claim too many times to dismiss it as coincidental.</p>
<p>Also, see my post here about my experience.</p>
