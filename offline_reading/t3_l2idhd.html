<title>So they put these little covers on the pin pads, ostensibly to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and then they never clean them. I'd rather just push the buttons directly.</title>

        <p>Apparently 20th Century Fox didn't know that the movie was about dysgenics and heritability of intelligence until after they were done shooting it.  They also didn't know that they were directly making fun of a bunch of actual corporations.  (Remember Carl's Jr's slogan "Fuck you, I'm eating" and Starbucks' "full service" lattes?)  That's why they only showed it in like 6 cities for one weekend.</p>

<p>Substitute in literally <strong><em>every</em></strong> other guideline/measure/mandate/rule/precaution, not <strong>a single one</strong> of which makes anybody healthier, nor makes anybodies immune system function better and avoid becoming dysregulated.  <strong><em>NOT ONE.</em></strong></p>

<p>"Check your tire pressure"  "okay, a couple of tires were low so I put air in them.  My car is still on fire.  What do I have to do now."</p>
<p>"Check you windshield wiper fluid."  "Okay, my windshield wiper guild was low, so I added more.  My car is still burning down.  What do I have to do now?"</p>
<p>"Try singing the happy birthday song."  "Ok, I sang the happy birthday song, but my car is still burning.  What should I do?"</p>
<p>"Try the song thing again.  It should work."  "Okay, I sang the happy birthday song again, but my car is still burning.  What should I do"</p>
<p>"That's really strange singing didn't work.  It should have worked.  You probably didn't sing correctly.  Try turning on your left turn signal"</p>
<p>"Okay, I turned on the left turn signal but my car is still burning.  What should I do now?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure you put it to the left position?  I think you put it to the right turn position.  Change it to the other position"</p>
<p>"Okay, I changed it to the other position.  Maybe you're right and I did it the wrong way the first time.  My car is still burning.  Tell me what I have to do now."</p>
<p>"Sing the happy birthday song WHILE you honk the horn.  That should work ...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Enough.</p>
<p>When there's a problem (like some people's immune systems becoming dysregulated), you don't do all these idiotic things that have NOTHING to do with people's immune systems, like one way arrows on the floor, and masks, and all this other bull droppings;  you help people's immune systems function properly and not become dysregulated!</p>
<p>Yet almost everybody in the world is totally going along just like that 'conversation' above.  Obviously if your car is on fire, you shoot your correctly classed fire extinguisher at the base of the fire, because THAT'S <em>what</em> the problem <strong>is</strong>; fire!  Not low tire pressure, or lack of singing a song, etc.</p>
<p>This virus, like most other pathogens, causes some people's immune systems to become dysregulated, and their own immune system is causing some to become very ill, and causing some to die.  Science has known all along how to solve this problem.  Doctrine is unable to reap great profit off solving the problem so they simply leave people to die, except to the extent they can generate profit/income.</p>

        <p>And that leads to a positive feedback loop, or "purity spiral."  No one wants to be the person who did the least, so the they all strive to "do something" just a little more than the minimum.  And so that minimum point ratchets endlessly upward.</p>

        <p>I usually stick my grubby little fingers under those and push the buttons directly. The keys underneath are probably cleaner than those covers. Not that I'm worried about a bit of bacteria. Gotta keep my immune system strong, but those things are straight up grimy.</p>

        <p>From the looks of it, you are probably correct.  The little covers were put on, along with the self-adhesive plastic wrap on the screen, and as far as the management is concerned, problem solved.</p>

        <p>I don't understand why we still need to sign for credit cards, especially during a 'pandemic'. I have never actually signed for 10 years now. My aunt makes smiley faces. If you didn't have to touch the pen, it would be way more sanitary. It's not about the virus.</p>
