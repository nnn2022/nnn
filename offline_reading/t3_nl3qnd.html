    <strong>Why “educated” people can’t see what’s happening</strong>
    <p><p>Was speaking to a friend about all these unnecessary restrictions this past year and despite the Texas and Florida examples of no restrictions not having an impact on “cases” he continued to defend them. This is someone who was a straight A “educated” student which made me realise all these “educated” people ever did was read, learn, and recite a text book. They listened and were obedient back then and will continue to do the same now regardless of blatant evidence that goes against the narrative and their view that they’ve been force fed by main stream media</p></p>

        <p>I went to college on the GI bill and was 5 or so years older than most others in my class and had seen a little bit of life.  The gulf between students coming straight out of high school versus my fellow veterans was enormous.   We were, on average, better students, largely because we earned our tuitions whereas half of the kids just didnt care;  they didn't care about truly learning and only cared about "um professor, is this going to be on the exam".</p>

        <p>As a current senior in college, I agree with majority of what you’re saying. Most students don’t actually want to be there but we are indoctrinated to believe it will be useful and it’s the only way. They are drilling college into middle schoolers and elementary grade kids nowadays. It’s unfortunate but most companies are requiring one before even considering hiring one. And college doesn’t teach anything useful in most cases. It is bullshit to begin with so it’s no surprise that students are so uninterested. </p>
<p>Most high schoolers I talk to are killing themselves from the immense amount of stress of even getting accepted into college. They are taking outrageous amounts of AP course and staying up all night at sixteen years old. They are more stressed about their future and grades than I ever have been. It’s unhealthy and fucked up. I feel so bad for high schoolers now a days. They are walking into institutions that make them believe there is only one way to survive and that is school. Most kids don’t KNOW better before it’s too late.</p>

        <p>Yes but also not exactly feasible for everyone especially when school doesn’t like to discuss trades. In fact they almost shame it unless you are exposed due to an extra curricular, family, or interest. Most kids out of high school are going to college whether it be community or university because that is what’s being drilled into them. Also, it’s what companies are requiring from employees now a days outside of trades. I wish trades were emphasized more in school and wish there were more alternatives to gaining a skill or certificate and that being sufficient enough instead of a piece of paper that signifies you can turn in homework and projects.</p>

        <p>This is true, at least in my area they shutdown the trade schools or trades classes in most if not all of the high schools going back around 25 years ago and people were saying it was the worst decision they had ever seen. Looking back it almost seemed like someone's master plan to deplete all of the trades in the province to create a disaster.</p>

        <p>My bro got me into an electrical company straight out of high school. I figured I could go to college and spend money I didn't have to learn something that might not be useful to me or I could try out the trade and make a few bucks before deciding what might be useful to take at college. I never looked back, best decision I ever made.</p>

        <p>They don’t but they do because teachers and counselors stress them out tremendously to perform beyond what they should be realistically. It drives them to insane burn out and depression at such a young age because they don’t know what college is actually like. They don’t know how to realistically check these expectations because everyone is shoving it down their throat that they need to take this many AP classes, get this gpa, be involved in extra curricular, get volunteer hours... list goes on and on</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've seen students driven to the edge of suicide over acedemic demands. 
Maybe my superpower was just not giving a damn about how important everyone was telling me school/college is. I went to university for a while, dicked around with it, decided I didn't like the high price or the atmosphere, and went to trade school. I meet a lot of people with University degree who earn poor wages, or they earn decent wages that then translate to poor wages because they are constantly paying off so much debt. I don't feel bad about being an acedemic loser anymore.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen fourteen year old kids in sheer fear and panic because of the stress that college dooms on them. I’ve seen so many suicidal peers and even felt some sentiments like that myself. It’s a really fucked system. As someone who’s about to finish their degree I partially regret pursuing an education. I certainly don’t think I am better than anyone who doesn’t have one. Do not feel bad ever and nobody should. It’d be different if college taught valuable skills but the education is so fucked. I had a better experience at a community college than a major Texas public university. We need to come up with a better solution because it’s a very expensive waste of time to get a piece of paper. After seeing the tainted world that is academia it made me realize how little I wanted to pursue a third degree.</p>

        <p>This is why critical thinking is my top priority in homeschooling three kids. Critical thinking over appeals to authority and rote memorization are the key to ending the generational stupidity.</p>

        <p>Came here to agree :) I homeschool my two kiddos. It’s hard as hell, but being able to encourage learning without rigid timeframes, and obtuse expectations has allowed space for them to develop a deeper understanding as well as critical thinking skills. Solidarity fellow homeschool parent. It’s the most challenging and rewarding work I’ve ever done:)</p>

        <p>So there is a very troubling phenomenon that is happening in the world. As higher education has become more available to more people, but at the same time the cost of that education has also skyrocketed, there is a greater need by those who spent lots of money on their education to place a lot of value on that education to help them justify the very high cost. This manifests itself in many ways, but one of those ways is the almost deification of the well educated. The more prestige that is placed on being educated, the more perceived value there is in one's own expensive education. This makes people revere and trust people based on how much education they have, rather than if what they say is actually true or even intelligent. And this trust leads to educated people blindly following "experts" and never questioning them, because that's just what educated people are supposed to do.</p>

        <p>You notice this in graduate school as well. Lots of people who get good grades in high school and even undergraduate studies are just those avid rule-followers. They study a lot and rely on rote memorization, even for topics that require logic to truly grasp the ideas deeply. You see the herd get thinned out that first year of grad school when the problems you get for homework/projects/exams may not have a known solution, may not even <em>be</em> solvable, but professors just want to see how you use the tools you've supposedly acquired to tackle the problem. It's especially true in research, where the questions are open ended and one needs to really figure out the best approach on their own. I've seen a lot of straight-A types fail at this stage, while people who are naturally curious and inquisitive may excel even though they not be the best kind of student stereotypically. </p>
<p>I've seen a study that shows that educated people are more likely to get vaccinated, until you actually reach the top end- then it starts to trend in the other direction (STEM fields only). I think we are seeing people who are credentialed, but not necessarily "smart" or competent enough to understand the risks, and they are severely overconfident. The most highly educated and wealthy seem to understand that you should be weighing the risk/reward for your own personal health and life choices, and that a one size fits all rule of "jUsT sHuT uP aNd gEt vAxXeD", won't work for something as complex as medical science. It's like the dunning-kruger effect is playing out in real-time.</p>

        <p>I’m also in grad school, I can’t believe the lack of critical thinking skills students in the social sciences and humanities have, and as grad students nonetheless. </p>
<p>It’s almost like some of these social science and humanities departments are designed to fleece money from the students while the professors do nothing but shout propaganda at them and then reward their students with good grades when they parrot it back in their papers and research…</p>

        <p>Humanities has become an absolute joke. It's not just the students, it's the professors too. I went to a fancy "top tier" (regurgitating the brochure propaganda after years of indoctrination) university, the STEM faculty were often so impressive I was questioning internally whether or not they were even human beings, maybe genetically modified to be so much more intelligent than I was (half joking).<br>
My few encounters with the humanities department mostly had me wondering if these people had yet mastered forming complete, coherent sentences. The gap was so stark in contrast between these two groups that I think even most of the humanities students noticed it. They had apparently started making the freshman level engineering/math students and faculty  endure some of these humanities lectures and it was <em>not</em> going over well. I saw an amazingly hilarious encounter where a white woman was telling these two mathematics professors, one from Senegal and the other from India (both whom I knew personally, and had come from extremely difficult backgrounds), that mathematics encourages "white supremacy". The look on their faces was that of someone who cannot believe that they are awake and not in a dream where the world has been turned upside down. Mathematics brought these two from the most desperate and hopeless areas of the world, ravaged by true tragedy and oppression, and gave them a lifetime job in the richest country in the history of the world. Then a white chick who was likely a privileged trust fund baby is telling them that it's oppression, I shit you not. It's always projection.</p>

The very thing my liberal sister in law fights for as she teaches immigrant children. She feeds them propaganda as well.

<p>My father has a grade 8 education and is one of the smartest people I know.</p>

<p>Comes to me for advice on all things Covid and NWO. Ignores anything I have to say about Socialism, Authoritarianism (their ties to the NWO), Islam or Climate Change. She literally chooses the lie she wants to believe. </p>

<p>The only part I'm cheering is that HOPEFULLY the wealth of rich people is wiped out.</p>
<p>Rich people had a chance to use their wealth to improve the world, but instead they just bought extra houses they don't need or use.</p>
<p>The rest of the reset tho... sounds like hell. But if it happens I will laugh all day at the formerly rich people. It will be my remaining joy</p>

        <p>Students don’t think, they just do what their teachers/professors tell them to do, repeat and memorize information. A lot of post secondary education has a hard liberal leaning, many of these educators will single out/fail most students that show a slightly right wing outlook on some issues. I’ve had it happen and have heard several stories of it happening to others. The post secondary education is to make cookie cutter employees that fit a certain criteria and educators rarely reward people for going against the curve, take a different approach, as that makes their jobs more difficult. Good unbiased teachers are very hard to come by.</p>

        <p>The media has been threatening their survival for a year and a half. If you believe your life to be in jeopardy rationality goes out the window, for the vast majority. Combine that with many of those same people not having the inclination to be curious enough to question what they are told. Most people are decent so the idea of psychopaths lying to them intentionally doesn't seem possible and they reject the whole thing.</p>
<p>Combine that with worldwide communication where other people tell them they are silly for fearing for their life and it gets worse for them, and worse for the people frustrated they won't question the dogma.</p>

        <p>I totally get what you mean about engineering and cs cultivating critical thinking skills (navigating code and deriving step-by-step solutions to complex problems can only be achieved by those who can think critically and pragmatically), buuuuuut some of my close friends from HS who went on to graduate with various CS degrees (from top universities in the US, frustratingly enough) are completely blind to reality. I feel like even when critical thinking skills are taught well in school, the structure of education hinders students' ability to apply the same skills/ways of thinking to subject matter outside of their specialized programs, fields of work that they aren't familiar with, and sometimes even their own personal circumstances in real-life.</p>

        <p>I've wondered what's different between those believe everything they're told and when the story flips vs those who are skeptical of it. I'm leaning more towards it having to do with the way someone thinks and their childhood and not their education/grades. I had abusive neglectful parents and early on learned to mistrust authority figures and assume they would lie or let me down and that I had to look out for myself because no one else can really be trusted. I did fairly well in school but felt a lot of it was pointless busy work so as soon as I got the career I wanted I stopped advancing my education. People who typically do well in school maybe had better childhoods where they felt safe and protected by their parents so are less inclined to mistrust authority? I'm not really sure but I'm feeling this might have something to do with it. People from rougher backgrounds are more likely to be less educated and more distrusting.</p>

        <p>Education = regurgitation </p>
<p>Education is indoctrination, creating slaves that will  not push the boundaries of the invisible cell created for us (by us to an extent) that we have been taught to exist in. Education is not about intelligence, sure you can gain knowledge, but will it give you the key to your cage?</p>

In his last tweets, he seems to be grappling, trying to make sense of how this  could have happened.

        <p>I used to think that University was the place of prestige. Until I started University and saw that it wasn't. But I still held that post-grad MUST surely be a rank of value...  </p>
<p>Masters and PhD candidates are among the most dim, narrow-minded people I have ever met. They are really really knowledgeable of one sliver of something, but drop down to high school level intelligence on any other topic worth discussing. They learn what is necessary but have no genuine hunger for education.   </p>

        <p>The point of modern education is to train people to sit obediently and mirror whatever the teacher tells them, with no thought, questions, or discussion. Anyone who sticks out even a little gets stuffed with adhd meds, whether they need it or not. Getting A's just means the system likes how you're behaving, and has nothing to do with intelligence.</p>

        <p>Great article written by John Taylor Gatto on education. </p>
<p>https://thesunmagazine.org/issues/175/why-schools-dont-educate</p>
<p>The way I see it, schools don’t teach so much as they indoctrinate and teach absolute obedience to authority and power. The idea is to be smart enough so that you can design and build the machines that keep the system going, but too dumb to consider that improvements can be made and self sufficiency is key. If the citizens could do, think, and act of their own accord then they wouldn’t be the bewildered herd that the managerial class can control dominate, but coordinated and self sufficient mass, the very thing government fears as there would be no need for them.</p>

        <p>Educated and intelligent are two very different things. Also, people have differing areas of intelligence. Someone good at math might not be good at recognizing psyops. Someone that got an education in whatever might be gullible and believe everything on the news. And to make it that much worse, critical thinking isn't being taught in very many schools.</p>

        <p>I am not sure what you are trying to say, but my country just reopened and now if you want to go drink a beer you have to get tested every two days and give that data (including time, workplace, dates of unemployment, illnesses, etc.)(to the minister of health. Green pass incoming. Kids have their own little "ninja pass". And if a police officer asks about your COVID-19 papers, and you answer with here it is officer, and I am not a Jew you get locked up up to three years.</p>
<p>So yea, it's all going great so far.</p>
<p>In case the "Aufdeckernetzwerk" sees this post and thinks about "correcting" it: I do love my government very much and would like to be a gay couple with my chancellor and finance minister. They are so sexy.  </p>
<p>Oh, and I meant 600 more sample size, in case that was confusing to you.</p>
