    <strong>Genuinely curious, not looking for an argument.</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m a mask wearer, I’ve gotten both doses of my vaccine, and I work in public health and have seen the effects of covid. I’m just curious as to why you guys don’t wear masks even though it is proven to stop the spread of the virus. I guess I just find it weird how a lot of you guys are complaining about lockdowns and restrictions even though it can be traced back to people not wearing masks. Then I see a lot of people saying “the mortality rate is low so therefore masks doesn’t matter”. I guess I’m just confused as to why a lot of you guys think all the restrictions and mask wearing is bullshit even though it has been proven to potentially save lives and prevents people from dealing with long term affects of the disease. </p>
