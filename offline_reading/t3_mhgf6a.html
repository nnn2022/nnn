    <strong>Hoping to speak with someone who identifies or follows the evangelical church or the belief that what we’re seeing is what the bible foretold.</strong>
    <p><p>I’d like to know your perception of what’s going on. I think there’s really something to this being “the end”, as the bible has said. </p>
<p>I personally believe what the bible foretold is here and we’re at the end of something. But I believe the wisdom was talking about our connection to the holy spirit. Not to take our physical lives, but our souls. Perhaps that’s no problem for an atheist, but I have a big problem with that. </p>
<p>I think Satan is represented as a very dark ideology that is upon us and those who have faith will resist at all costs and something beautiful will await us. Most will submit to it though. And lose their connection to the divine</p></p>

<p>This sounds very New Agey to me as a Christian because the Bible makes it clear that satan is a literal entity and that the only way to survive evil is to be born again (ie, Rom 10:8-13) by confessing with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believing in your heart that God raised Him from the dead.   </p>

<p>Unparalleled global deception, fear and tyranny all designed to ultimately have all humans 'certified' with a digital identity that is linked to health history, UBI benefits, financial transactions, social credit score, transhumanism, etc is straight out of the book of Revelation. Another big sign is that people, despite being shown the truth, continue to choose to believe the unending streams of lies.</p>

        <p>I see it all as a trial run for what they eventually want at the end game. A biometric system that’s linked to a global economy which will eventually require something to be implanted into your body. Everything we’re seeing now is a trial balloon for that eventuality. Just another notch on the dial turning that water up to eventually boil.</p>

        <p>I agree, we’re in a battle for our souls. We’re going to have to resist at all costs. And unfortunately, things are about to become very uncomfortable for those of us who do.</p>
