    <strong>Good news!</strong>
    <p><p>Good morning my wonderful Brothers and Sisters! I hope you are doing well! If you have any prayer requests please let me know.</p>
<p>John 9:2-7 (KJV)  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p>Most Kind and Gracious Heavenly Father, 
Thank you for sending Your Son Jesus Christ to die for our sins! Thank you for ressurrecting Him three days later. Please help us not to judge others by their circumstances and the things that they are going through. You are the only righteous judge, Father. Instead help us to show compassion and mercy.
In Jesus Precious Name we humbly pray, Amen!</p></p>
