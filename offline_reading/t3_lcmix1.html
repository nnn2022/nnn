    <strong>Got a beard trim today at a salon</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Utah (just south of Salt Lake), which actually has been one of the least restricted places throughout this whole ordeal, so for the most part things have been relatively normal. And while the salon by my house never shut down, they did stop doing beard trims last April. But today I went in to get a haircut, and asked if they were doing beard trims yet, fully expecting the answer to be no. But to my surprise, she said she could now. I was thrilled. This was great for a few reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It was nice getting an actual beard trim. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that the salon is no longer forbidding beard trims at the corporate level is a good sign of businesses beginning to relax their policies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the past I think many of the stylists were too afraid to give beard trims, so with or without the policy they would have refused giving beard trims anyways. But her feeling comfortable giving me a beard trim does represent a shift in attitudes that I do feel is happening here. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just wanted to post some positive stuff. I know things are pretty dark around the world and don't seem to be getting much better, but just know that there is still some sanity left in the world.</p></p>
