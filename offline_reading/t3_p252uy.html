    <strong>It’s the guilt tripping for me</strong>
    <p><p>I finally stood up to my family (again) after their new and improved harassment over delta/lambda bullshit. Sent all the clinicaltrials.gov trial completion dates/links after being gaslit and told it was proven safe for pregnancy. Bullshit it has. Pfizer literally states that there is insufficient data to inform vaccine associated risks in pregnancy, and that there is no data to assess the effects of the vaccine on breastfed infants or on milk production. Oh- and that the vaccine may not protect all recipients and that there are severe adverse reactions (they don’t list any besides anaphylaxis and refer you to VAERS). I have been indirectly threatened and I called the bluff. Demanded they no longer speak to me about it and that I would not be attempting to explain my decision anymore as I have already tried. The guilt tripping starts and indirect ridiculing. I started sobbing because it feels like I’ve lost my family in some sense. They are disappointed and it hurts so much. I feel like shit. I can’t believe our loved ones are willing to take it this far. The alienation is really taking a toll on me. </p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that your family is not open to your views. I’m going through kind of the same thing with my family. I think they’re starting to come around though as my daughter whose vaccinated just got covid for the second time. </p>
<p>I’m the only one unvaccinated and the only one that hasn’t gotten covid yet. Family of four.</p>

        <p>I’m continuing to get pressured by my family even after nicely listing out the reasons for my decision. My aunt has been the most outspoken, it’s become borderline harassment at this point. I’m a single mom, so she’s been using the “what would your son do without you?” line. Her birthday was last week, she text me saying all she wanted for her birthday was for me to get vaccinated- to which I responded “I’m a single mom, not a lab rat. Happy birthday”. </p>
<p>It sucks not being respected for a very personal decision. Hang in there, it’s gonna get worse before it gets better.</p>

        <p>Looks like I did not do a good job picking friends either. Some people I have known 40yrs have turned against “my type”. The fuck!</p>

        <p>If they watch the news pundits on the left they are constantly campaigning for views to harass their family about this shit vaccine from hell. Stay strong, being a skeptic is hard but it makes you more resistant to the mind virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's been a very revealing seeing how brainwashing occurs in real-time.</p>
<p>It feels like waking up from the prototype of the matrix and the people who still have trust in the system defend it to the death as it kills them.</p>
