        <p>what do you expect ?</p>
<p>everyone has a break point.</p>
<p>it wouldn't be any different if covid decimated your family/workplace/town (like was promised).</p>
<p>but instead the countermeasures have decimated your family/workplace/town.</p>
<p>it's amazing how polarizing it is also, huge mistake the left made to politicize it.</p>
<p>now they have a lot of good democrats and good liberals that have been disenfranchised by their own local governments and had their livelihood ruined - all for nothing.</p>

        <p>The left didn’t politicize it at all.  Trump made it political before it got to the US, and he’s lied continuously to polarize people as much as possible.</p>
<p>Urging safety in a global crisis is <em>not</em> a political statement.  This is common sense, and it’s what any decent person does.</p>

        <p>Where's the lie?  Trump was spouting bullshit about masks and claiming they aren't needed, and his dumbass got the virus because of that.  Over 200k Americans have died, and his lying inspired morons like you to co-sign his bullshit message.  </p>
<p>I don't understand why you guys try to hard to pretend this isn't happening and very real.  Pandemic cycles typically last 18-24 months, so this will eventually end, and we will actually return to normal.  The more people like you spread nonsense, the longer it takes to fully recover.  This is simple stuff my dude.</p>

        <p>Why do you think pandemic cycles end?  Is it because we all used to shelter in place till the pathogen got bored?  People are going to get this. Some are going to die, most of whom were on the tail end of a long life.  It’s going to spread, and thank God that it’s not any worse than it is, and it will run out of people but we are prolonging this end with these whackamole shutdowns. </p>

<p>I'm not an epidemiologist, so I can't say for sure, I just understand that's a widely known figure based on other pandemics.  </p>

<p>This is a once-in-a-hundred year virus, of course there are going to need to be a lot of measures taken to reduce the damage it does.  The lockdowns saved scores of people, and if stupid motherfuckers would stop spreading misinformation about masks and the virus, we could have saved a lot more people then and prevent even more deaths coming up.  The winter will only make this thing worse before it gets better.    </p>
<p>Why can't you just be a team player and wear a damn mask for the next year?  Literally everybody wants to get back to normal, not just the few dipshits that come here.</p>

        <p>Lies: That Trump is the one big bad boogie man politician who has politicized the response to the virus. Have you seen Democrat run states?  Perhaps try taking off your CNN-colored glasses to see the amount of politicizing going on there. Universal masking with very little evidence of any kind of efficacy presented as panacea, reopening metrics based off of unreliable testing that have benchmarks for opening that are impossible to reach, and continual usage of extending emergency powers to governors who make ever more unilateral and rights-abusing executive orders. Won’t even go into the CDC and WHO. </p>
<p>You don’t have to have a fucking PhD in epidemiology to have some idea that pandemics burn out when they have no more opportunities to infect large swaths of people at once. For high, quick mortality diseases, there is a faster burnout to extinction. For viruses like COVID, with high contagion and low mortality, eventually a baseline herd immunity is achieved and then is relegated to seasonal or cyclical outbreaks. This thing is too contagious and too mild in most people to be able to simply stamp out by hiding from it. It. Doesn’t. Work. Quit deluding yourself. People who tell you this are either as lied to or misinformed as you are or they have a fucking agenda. Wake up. </p>
<p>I can be a team player when the team isn’t spouting bullshit plays. Perhaps you need to question your own biases before you come in here to try and plead with me or anyone else to “just get with it and stop being stupid.”  Look in the mirror first.</p>

        <p>Masks work, everyone knows it.</p>
<p>Dem states didn’t fully get it right, but the point is they are putting most people’s health over political interests. This is an emergency, if governors don’t exercise emergency powers now, then when?  This is a hundred year virus, and we can’t just wait it out, strong measures are absolutely needed.</p>
<p>Herd immunity is not happening.  The infection rates are very, very far from the threshold necessary, and nobody knows how long the antibodies actually stick around and prevent re-infection.  </p>
<p>What’s the agenda here boss?  I don’t like this temporary new normal at all either, in fact I hate it.  I want to make it out of this thing with my own health, and that of my friends and family.  That’s the agenda.</p>

        <p>I really don’t think there’s anything I can say that would really help you understand. You seem very convicted of the narrative you own and I can’t say what really characterizes what allows someone to see things the way I do. I don’t trust things at face value. I try and look at all of the angles as much as I can, and this is where I’ve landed. </p>
<p>I have limited time to argue on Reddit with a stranger, or even someone I know. If you feel like it, explore through more posts here for data and coherent arguments.  I recommend looking at u/capt_roger_murdock posts and comments.  I suppose if anything I hope you might start to open up that this group of people isn’t the enemy.</p>

Please see it for what it is- that  person is fucking TERRIFIED because of what the media did to him. Picture a feral human in the corner of a room being poked with tasers by people screaming "you're going to die if you don't listen!" And you're in the other corner trying to freaking <em>reason</em> with him. He's scared shitless hiding behind proven false talking points so he doesn't have to see himself as a scared chimp bearing his teeth at a damn cold virus. Now it makes sense right?</p>

        <p>Most people are <em>tired,</em> trust me. My co-workers complain about wearing these masks all day. At closing, soon as the last customer leaves the store and we get the clear, those masks are <em>off.</em> LOL.</p>
<p>I overheard two men having a convo on my bus ride the other day and they were talking about how it's "high time they tell us it's okay to go back to normal now and take these things off."</p>
<p>Earlier last month I was talking to a colleague and she was saying everyone is tired of this too! The reddit and twitter world is definitely <em>not</em> a representative of the general population for sure. Granted, I still have to take a break every once in a while from these sites for my own sanity, but more people are awake to this than you think!</p>

        <p>It depends. Sometimes I see some of the popular regs here make comments that get upvotes, though I suspect it's the likes of us doing so, plus maybe a few strays from /r/Coronavirus. Sometimes I see these sort of comments downvoted to oblivion still.</p>

        <p>I assume they're reacting to that CNN article claiming things will never return to normal. </p>
<p>I really believe articles like that are a symptom of the corporate press starting to panic that they're losing control of the narrative. If their warnings and fear porn won't work, they'll simply run a psyop to program (and I use that term intentionally) the masses that COVID restrictions are an inevitable phenomenon similar to gravity, and therefore resistance is futile.    I expect more of these articles to follow as metrics continue to improve, as the intensity of the Doomer narrative must be inversely proportional to the strength of the contrary evidence in order to have any effect.</p>

        <p>You do realize the entire point of the shutdowns to “flatten the curve” was to extend how long this goes on, don’t you? When they started all this they kept showing that dumb model, if we did nothing it’d spike high fast and “overwhelm” hospitals then be done, but with all these measures it’d be drawn out into one long low trend. The people breaking restrictions are the ones who are actually going to be more likely to end this sooner by developing immunity, and everyone following this and wearing the masks and distancing and everything going along with the measures are going <em>to extend it</em></p>

        <p>Considering this all started as "Flatten the curve!"... Yes, it should have been over months ago.</p>
<p>When this started, we all accepted the reality that people would die. Viruses exist and people die from viruses. You know, as has been the case for as long as humans and the creatures we evolved from existed. We primarily wanted to prevent unnecessary deaths by overwhelmed hospitals. We did not want to stop the virus from infecting people because we accepted that as unreasonable.</p>
<p>The curve has flattened to well below hospital capacity (in fact, next to zero hospitals were ever full or overwhelmed with coronavirus patients), but somewhere along the line it went from the rather reasonable "A couple weeks to flatten the curve for our hospitals" to the totally insane "we need to keep people from ever getting a virus"</p>
