        <p>How interesting. My husband and I were talking about this exact thing over dinner. We don't know of one single serious case, zero deaths (we know a lot of people), and as far as I can tell nobody in my neighborhood has been hospitalized. My neighborhood, except for a few, has been going about business like normal. No masks, still throwing parties, visiting other neighbors with no social distancing. And all this in a supposed "hot spot" state. This whole thing is a scam. If it were a truly deadly pandemic, there would be NO debate.</p>

        <p>Same here. I regularly interact regularly with at least 100 people and not a single death from Covid, and I'd be skeptical if there were one death due to covid.</p>

        <p>Don't forget even if you knew someone who died "of COVID-19” there's absolutely no way to prove that was the cause. No Corona virus has ever been isolated in history. My veterinarian told me 20 years ago not to bother with a Corona virus vaccine since there's no proof it even exists. Still no proof.</p>

        <p>Same. This pandemic needs a constant media campaign to remind everyone that it still exists. </p>
<p>Also, plagues in the past killed people in ways that the average person would find obvious. </p>
<p>A COVID death cannot be discerned from many other deaths by the ‘average person.’</p>

        <p>I've seen people going around claiming things like "people are collapsing in the streets" and "bodies are being hauled away by the truckload".  </p>
<p>I dunno where they live, but that sure as shit ain't happenin' here. My province here in Canada has only just crossed the 600 "COVID-associated" (not "from" COVID though) fatality. That's out over around 1.2 million people. Over the span of more than a year-and-a-half now. ICU's were never "overwhelmed", or anywhere close to it, either. And in fact, we never even had much in the way of restrictions or even mask mandates until around last December.  </p>
<p>And, here's the thing. I'm actually something of a "prepper" (though not to the comical degree as often portrayed in media and movies). I simply like to be ready for anything. I keep my house fully stocked with multiple weeks worth of supplies and necessities, and I am ready to get myself and my family the hell out of Dodge at any time should the need arise. My family owns rural property as well - my siblings and I own a cabin at a lake, and my uncle owns a ranch further northwest, so I have multiple "safe haven" options. I keep tabs on world events more than most, and especially where said events impact my local area. And I even have family members who work for the government (Department of Defense, for example) who would be informed before the general public if something truly serious was taking place.  </p>
<p>Considering all of this, if this virus was anywhere near as "deadly" as it's being made out to be, I would have been one of the first people to hunker down. But nothing about it screams "hide out in a bunker for two years". Not even close.   </p>
<p>To me, the real pandemic is the widespread acceptance of brazen government overreach under obviously false pretenses.</p>
