    <strong>More than a year has passed since the pandemic started</strong>
    <p><p>To start with, I want to share my feelings with people on this subreddit as I can relate to some posts here </p>
<p>It has been over a year now, we experienced a lot of restrictions, lockdowns and some of us even had coronavirus itself including me. I had a severe case of pneumonia. We heard how dangerous pandemic is, and trust me it is, however, the danger of a virus itself include the danger of how the governments use the pandemic in order to gain the advantage of their citizens.  </p>
<p>I still agree upon this day that the restrictions in 2020, March were right as we didn't know that much about the virus itself back then, but it is 2021, and most of us are still locked in our own homes.             </p>
<p>Honestly, at this point in time, it just feels like we are being tested for our stupidity. New rules like wearing a double mask, wearing only FFP respirators, leaving your house more than 8 km is illegal etc. are just ridiculous, but what about the small businesses that are just closing left and right, they simply cannot survive with such restrictions, how many people lost their jobs, some students like me just got scammed because we paid for a real education in classes however instead we are getting online for the full price, hospitals only focus on coronavirus pretending that other diseases don't exist anymore, also I want to mention people that organised funerals of their own relatives back in March 2020. I remember how on news, I saw that it was done via zoom, people really went through that, but in March 2021 we have big companies that have no troubles being opened as it is hard to get corona there unlike in your local grocery store, we have politicians that simply don't follow their own rules, we have stupid protests that obviously cannot transmit coronavirus because of science. </p>
<p>However, when real protests occur they suddenly start transmitting the virus, I'm a Russian-German, living in Russia, when our Opposition leader showed how Putin really lives, protests began, and guess what, most people there got jailed for spreading a virus and some got brutally beaten up. </p>
<p>This is how we live now people, what else can I say?</p></p>

        <p>So much sense in your post, and I agree with all of it... likewise I agreed originally with the measures put in place but it soon became apparent that something wasn’t quite right... the thing that triggered my questioning them was the data for the recovered from Covid in the U.K. (there still isn’t any readily available data on it) so it appears that no one actually recovers from it in the U.K. (so they’re deliberately manipulating data so that they can make up whatever  they like to scare the general public into doing whatever they say, or so it appears) then all the stories of full occupancy in hospitals which, when looked into on the official government websites and using their own data, show that this is far from the case ... if only the normies would do a little bit of digging, the info is only a couple of clicks away, then maybe we wouldn’t be in the shitfest we find ourselves...</p>
