    <strong>What Are Your Future Plans After This Plandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>Most of our plans that were prior to this plandemic are all garbage now. The greed to move forward, to become powerful and very wealthy and all that are all down the drain. Whether it's our degrees and whatever now, the government will not let us succeed. (I live in Canada fyi) and universal basic income will be a thing here.</p>
<p>So having no jobs and no economic activity, we are all on the same boat and the government will never let us prosper and do what we want. So, personally Idk anymore. There is nothing to do and I'm just focusing on myself and family, and thinking and making plans on were to move. Most likely I'll move back to the USA alone as I value freedom. And in red states, there is still a lot of freedom. Canada has become dystopian hellhole. That's my plan so far. What's yours?</p></p>

        <p>My job permanently closed last Tuesday due to my governor and mayor and their lockdown fetish. Thankfully I was able to get a new job four days later, so I’m grateful for that. I’m going to be saving so I can move out of California and go somewhere where my red vote will make a difference in future elections. I’m done being taxed out of my ass and paying a premium to live in a city where I need to climb over homeless people and trash to use the sidewalk; and where I can’t go to work, but I can go riot in the name of leftist causes. I’m sick of this place.</p>
