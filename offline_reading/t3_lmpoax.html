<p>In the article, one of the researchers mentions that it would be unethical to keep people in 'horrible lockdowns' once they get vaccinated, implying that they think current lockdowns are ethical, and also that vaccination is the only way to make people immune.</p></p>

        <p>This never made sense to me: if you can still spread COVID with a vaccine, then what's the point of mandating it?         <br>
And if you can't spread COVID with the vaccine, then why are restrictions not easing at all?          <br>
There's zero consistency (as usual).</p>

        <p>Sheep think vaccines stop illnesses they've had it hammered into their empty heads for decades. Even when told the vaccine won't stop covid by the government they cannot grasp the fact that it won't.  Vaccines are miracle cures for viruses.</p>

        <p>Exactly, if you can still spread COVID with the vaccine, then it's MY RESPONSIBILITY because it is MY HEALTH.</p>

        <p>&rt;“Obviously, to require everybody to stay in a state of horrible  lockdowns whilst they are vaccinated, I think that is also, in my mind,  unethical,” Flood said.</p>
<p>Oh nononono</p>
<p>&rt;“We’re not encouraging people to take a risky action — that is, become  infected with the virus. In fact, the opposite: We’re encouraging them  to do something that we think would be in the public good, that is, to  be vaccinated,” Flood said.</p>
<p>Spelling it out for us.</p>
<p>They are holding you hostage with this vaccine. Thats how you go about splitting the country. People who had to close their stores are going to want the lockdown to end to make a living, no matter what. The gouvernment locks everything up, and the key to freedom is if you take the vaccine. They are making you responsible for a problem they created. A la: Dont you see all those people who are unable to work because of you?" And once enough people have agreed, they have tha majority on their side and can pull shit like in Isreal, whhere you cant even buy food without the pass. It does not bother enough people anymore to start a revolution. If you let your country be vaccinated over 50%, it is the beginning of the end.</p>
