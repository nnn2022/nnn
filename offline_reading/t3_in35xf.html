    <strong>Losing friends at warp speed</strong>
    <p><p>I lost yet another "friend" yesterday. I sent her a video from Robert Kennedy Jr. and appealed to her to watch it so we could discuss it when we talked.  She did not watch it and when we talked it came out that she believes wearing a mask is "patriotic."  </p>
<p>I want to be understanding of others, but I am to the point where I literally cannot stomach talking to people who insist on supporting the global gaslighting.   </p>
<p>I feel I woke into a sci-fi movie with pod people everywhere.  Being awake is a very lonely road.</p></p>

        <p>I’m struggling with this currently. It turns out all my festival-going, drug-doing friends are fine giving up everything there is to live for in the name of safety. Sure they would’ve bought a shady pill from a dude on the corner 6 months ago and taken it without a 2nd thought but NOW they suddenly value their health and lives. One of my friends this morning says “the 3rd wave is gonna be brutal” and I’m like “we didn’t even have a 2nd dude! We had no cases when NYC was popping off”. Got no response. I just don’t know what to do anymore. This has made me question everything and whether I can keep up this charade with some of my friends. They’ve just become weak hypocrites and it’s demoralizing.</p>

        <p>These people will magically get back to normal with a vaccine. </p>
<p>Worse, the vaccime is coming from the trump administration, and there are so many anti trump people that insist that nothing will be back to normal with a vaccine. I bet these people either won't take it or will take it and go back to their trump hate.</p>
<p>These same people will suddenly care when the festival scene or favorite places are gone for good. But they dont care, they embraced the zoom/discord dystopia.</p>

        <p>Holy hell! I made the same connection a couple months ago about people who go to raves and festivals. I just got into the scene last year and crave more, only to be duped by the hellscape of this year. Between taking random drugs from strangers, passing out from intoxication, and not testing their substances, I find it oddly hilarious. Many festival goers and moshers love to push their bodies to the limits, but are scared to death over a flu-like virus! My ex overdosed and survived this year, but told me I should take these mandates more seriously... </p>
<p>All I can do is shake my goddamn head.</p>

        <p>I think they'll have second thoughts on this if the venues (together) speak up against covid restrictions. They're afraid to speak up about their struggles because their customers (these festival-goers) are deep into the kool-aid.</p>

        <p>Potentially unpopular opinion: If there’s a way to maintain even tangential relations with your friend, I would. I think it’s folly to make seeing this thing for the sham it is as a litmus test for friendship. We are trying to “save” people who don’t want to be saved right now, and it will just land you totally friendless. As long as you speak out and they know where you stand... that can be enough. You don’t have to convert them right now, today. Hold on to the people in your life who love you and who you love. You are going to need each other. </p>
<p>I absolutely cry over my friends and family being bamboozled into living a life of fear - and they know where I stand on the issue. I miss how our time together used to be. I seek new friendships with people who want to be and feel alive and do things. But cutting ties over this issue may do more harm than good and lead to further Balkanization of ideas and people.</p>
<p>If they are actually shaming you for your ideas, without provocation, that’s another thing entirely. </p>
<p>Also, getting off Facebook can be a lifesaver for friendships. They aren’t saying those things to YOU, they are saying them to Facebook 🙄 So you really don’t need to be audience to it.</p>

<p>“Don’t discuss it” is unrealistic advice. How are you supposed to “not discuss” that which has rendered every corner of reality unrecognizable?</p>

        <p>If you can, try walking into a grocery store as the only un-masked shopper. At first it’s a little anxiety inducing, but quickly feels empowering. Kind of a “fuck all this” freedom high. Highly recommend if possible.</p>

        <p>I think it’s best to, in this order: 1) strengthen bonds with friends who feel the same, 2) form NEW friendships with friends who feel the same, and 3) as 1 and 2 are solidified, if you still feel strongly, begin to distance yourself from old friends with whom you now have suddenly much less in common. </p>
<p>Build a place to land before you jump on this one. </p>
<p>The whole fucking false idea of lockdowns is that social connections and friendships and love between people aren’t crucial to human survival when they ARE. Thats why everyone is mentally unraveling at the hands of these tyrants. But the same damned logic rings true here. Your being right about the lockdowns isn’t going to keep you warm at night, isn’t going to be there for you if you really hit the skids, isn’t going to cry with you on the phone if your mom drops dead tomorrow. So just be careful. Righteousness is great but it’s a shit replacement for a human friend.</p>

        <p>I’ve been doing online dating and let all my matches know I will NOT wear a mask despite the mask mandate (if you claim a medical exemption, most stores here will still let you shop.) It sounds insane, but I’ve started asking my dates meet me at the grocery store as a “cute” unconventional date  on a Sunday when I claim to be busy with work deadlines.  Really what I’m seeing is whether they’ll walk into a store with me sans mask AFTER I’ve been explicitly clear that I believe masks are useless and only sheeple abide by our tyrant’s meaningless order.  If the mask goes on, I still get my grocery shopping done and, after checkout, never have to see him again. If he shops unmasked, i still get my shopping done annnnd magically my schedule opens up to make him dinner. It’s a winning strategy and a time saver all around.  Highly recommend to other singletons.</p>

        <p>While I appreciate the sentiment of your post, this is much bigger than converting them on an issue. This is a total kidnapping of their minds. They are abetting total societal obliteration with their fearfulness, foolishness and naïveté. They have rendered themselves unworthy of respect.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;If they are actually shaming you for your ideas, without provocation, that’s another thing entirely.</p>
<p>The thing is, we aren’t the ones with any “ideas.” We wish to simply live life as everyone always has. <em>They’re</em> the ones with all the “ideas.” Let’s close this and mask that! Let’s poison basic socioeconomic interaction indefinitely so we can feel moral! </p>
<p>It is them and their horrific “ideas” that are the problem.</p>
<p>I certainly agree with getting off social media. I never had any to begin with, thank God. Given the virtual town square social media has become - a platform for every curtain-twitching moral busybody on the planet to cheer on beheadings - non-participation is the only solution.</p>

        <p>I’ve lost tons of respect for most people in my life. </p>
<p>I do think their ideas are the problem and it feels like, at least to me, they are giving away the world I love and used to live in.</p>
<p>But I also struggle with depression (who doesn’t right now?) and caution against literally cutting out (“I can’t be your friend anymore, byyyye”) social resources during this time. Unless these friends are confronting you and telling you that you are bad and you are the problem and you need to change. </p>
<p>But if they just aren’t receptive to the articles you send them; if they are just blabbing on Facebook about their morality blah blah, no - I don’t think you should formally, openly divorce them. Take breaks from them. Mute them on social media (or get off toxic-ass social media entirely), or whatever. But don’t purge your contacts right now unless you’re SURE you’re better off friendless than with the friends you have. These things are difficult to reverse. </p>
<p>There’s The Cause (which is to say the cause for a world worth living in - no small thing and I’m not saying it is) and then there’s self preservation. If we sacrifice the latter to the altar of the former, there will be no one left to fight the fight, we will all be ineffective nubs.</p>
<p>But that’s just my opinion and I understand it’s complicated.</p>

<p>I have been struggling with this too, of course. I have many longtime friends with whom I’ve had disagreements over the years, but as I said, this time it’s global. Like...they’ve sometimes been wrong on this or that, but now they’re...cultists.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to write them off completely, I can’t reconcile how to ever see them the same way again after this. They have made it clear, via their actions and proclamations, that they don’t stand for any of the principles they’ve always claimed they have. Liberty? Forget it, we control you now. Prosperity? Shove your small business up your ass, grandma killer. Bodily autonomy? Muzzle yourself, covidiot.</p>
<p>What would a future relationship with someone like this look like? They’re frauds. Short of them waking up, pulling a 180, and profusely apologizing for their idiocy, I just can’t see it.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you that they rendered themselves unworthy of respect if for no other reason they show me no respect.  I am so full on inner conflict because, as many people commented, we are social creatures and no matter how strong one is, and I am pretty fucking strong, we need connection. I have my periods of unraveling, but I feel even worse when I try to stay connected with those who subscribe to the global gaslighting.  The powers that be knew exactly WTF they were doing. It was a masterful diabolical plan.</p>

        <p>Well said. I took a social media break a couple of months ago and unfollowed about 80% of my friends when I got back. Now I just text them to chat and avoid in-depth covid/ political conversations. Works very well.</p>

        <p>No, not really. I have a few close friends, but lately I've gotten introspective and started working on my physical and emotional well-being. Seeking a deep connection with others can be emotionally draining, especially nowadays. I enjoy time with friends, but I'm really enjoying finally getting around to doing things that give me a sense of emotional contentment.</p>

        <p>You make a good point and I will try, but I also feel this issue can reveal who your true friends really are.  A true friend would consider what you are saying because they respect you.  Also, gaslighting is deadly to one's mental health.  This <em>friend</em> I am referring to just might be showing that she would turn on me anyway. She said many other concerning things such as she thinks we should lock down harder and she supports a federal mask mandate.  I cannot connect with anyone with that viewpoint and I feel ill in my stomach to try.</p>
<p>I admit I am feeling pretty intense these days and with good reason.  I feel like I am suffocating to sit around and talk about superficial crap.  I want to lighten up, but I am honestly struggling greatly.  Thank you for responding to my post.</p>

        <p>I made an account on here finally just to connect with other likeminded people about this scamdemic. At first I was doing ok but with no end in sight, talking about this can be unbearable. Most of my friends are not pro lockdown/mandates, but they aren't necessarily against them so when I talk to them about it, the conversation is not that deep. My family supports the mandates as they are scared to death because of the media. MSM is to blame, despite their thinking process leading them astray.</p>
<p>My boyfriend has been the worst culprit though. He seems happy to comply with the mandates and has called me "selfish" and told me to "just wear a mask" when I tell him how we are being played. Almost every very time I show him more evidence about how  the "new normal" is not about the virus, he attempts to gaslight me.  He has compared me to "anti science rednecks" that complain to losing my rights over a "minor inconvenience". But I noticed that his lifestyle has not changed due to the recent events. Only thing that has changed for him is having to were a mask in public. He didn't have any big plans that were cancelled like I did. So it's easier for him to "go along to get along".</p>
<p>Anyway, based on your comments, I think you and I have a similar personality when it comes to wanting deep, meaningful connections. It's very hard to pretend everything is ok with constant reminders that thing's are not. Not being able to communicate effectively about it takes a toll. This is not an average, everyday debate. This nonsense has wasted so much time and ruined livelihoods. I just can't believe it's still happening.</p>
<p>When I come to this subreddit, I feel like we are survivors in Dawn of the Dead on rooftops communicating to each other with signs while being surrounded by zombies that want us dead. But skepticism has brought people together with people they'd otherwise have nothing in common with. And that gives me hope.</p>

        <p>I was in a relationship with someone who gaslit me damn near to death.  Do take caution who you let in your heart.  Your partner/confidant should not be undermining you.  Gaslighting literally causes biological changes in the brain.  Please do take extra care of yourself. He sounds like a narcissist.  They are no joke and very harmful. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your beautiful comment.  I can feel your sincere heart.  And yes, I am so utterly unfulfilled by superficial relations.  I long for deep connections of the heart.  Perhaps we can look to each other here for now to fill that need.</p>

<p>HFS, are you really me? Because my story sounds REALLY similar to yours.</p>
<p>Also, I hate to break it to you, since he sounds like he at least put up a decent facade of humanity, but your BF is kind of a POS, from what you've told me.</p>
<p>I could look past it if he were just repeating MSM propaganda out of terror, since a lot of people in my life do that, but he's actively gaslighting you in favor of the new abnormal. That's shitty under normal circumstances, but here? It's monstrous.</p>
<p>Not saying it's him personally, but he's the type of excuse for a human being that would happily have you, me and all of those "anti-science rednecks" concerned about their rights sent to the gulag and sleep like a baby at night for having done his civic duty.</p>

        <p>You're not obligated to grant any other human being your time or understanding. It's a good idea most of the time, but for stuff like this, when it's really hurting you on an emotional level, don't waste your time with them. </p>
<p>If anything, the whole lesson from 2020 should be to watch the fucking company you keep. Keeping pro-mask shitheads around (like, the zealots) because you feel like you want to salvage your relationship from before is the kind of trap abuse victims fall into when they stay with their abusers. It WILL bite you in the ass later. People like that will NOT help you when you need it the most, they WILL turn on you at your weakest moment, they WILL fuck you over in the future.</p>
<p>They're the kinds of Karens that are willing to call the cops on people over something as trivial as not wearing a mask. Whoever they were before 2020, they're gone now. Only the monstrous selves they were hiding underneath the illusory veneer of civilized society remains. Don't invite monsters into your houses. Only invite men. And women. And gender non-conforming people.</p>

        <p>COVID-19, underneath it all, is political. It boils down to fundamental issues of freedom, liberty, security, and the role the state plays in those issues.</p>
<p>I used to talk politics with all of my friends and family, heated debates. A whole decade spent doing this, being open to political discussion (I wasn't a zealot, but it often came up naturally). What I learned, unfortunately, is that it is extremely difficult to change someone's opinion, as nowadays it is such an personal and emotionally charged issue. All you do is make them feel attacked and further entrench their views. No matter how calmly you lay out the cause, no matter how many studies you show, no matter how logical your reasoning, I've learned it doesn't matter for 99% of people. They need to come to the conclusion on their own, or at least feel like they did, by doing their own research. My relationships have improved dramatically since I just avoided talking about COVID, Biden, Trump, Brexit, Socialism, Capitalism, anything.</p>

        <p>These churches exist. I go to one. Honestly you probably can tell what’s a good church by the mask wearing or lack thereof these days. My pastor offers neon orange wristbands for anyone who wants social distancing and asks us to respect that, but I’ve never seen anyone actually take one.  </p>
<p>We preach the Bible, but also take real science and history in account so you won’t hear sermons on how the Earth is 6,000 years old.</p>

        <p>Sadly not near me! Maybe you can find an anti-lockdown Facebook group and ask for church recommendations? It’s tough finding a church that’s neither too virtue signaling (believe it or not it’s “trendy” to virtue signal for left wing causes) nor too pious, but it can be done.</p>

        <p>I wish there were secular alternatives to churches. Personally I stopped being able to believe long ago and don't think I could be dishonest enough to pretend I do just to participate. The only thing that somewhat qualifies are Unitarian Universalists, and let's just say... they are not on our side.</p>

        <p>I don't know much about UU churches. I did explore one or two myself years ago before I found Jesus and became a Christian. What makes you say the Unitarian Universalists are on the "wrong" side? (I would agree from a Christian perspective, they are missing out on Jesus, but what makes  <em>you</em> say that?)</p>

        <p>I also will be your cyber friend if you’re in the market for another.  I have worn a mask exactly twice since my state’s mandate went into place.  Once to a dr appt for a routine physical (and only because I badly needed her to refill my standard migraine meds) and once to to Target (a Trump mask and a Smith &amp; Wesson hat, specifically.  I got a lot of glares, but not a peep from anyone!) I feel it is my patriotic duty to go about the world unmasked, pushing back where I have to and settling an example for others that it’s okay to not be afraid and show it. 🇺🇸</p>

<p>Because there was alot talk about fake news either for or against Trump in 2019.   And if she didn’t like fake news during 2019.  Ask her how she could think that the media would be 100% Truthful under a crisis </p>

        <p>Disagree with this sentiment. We need to share otherwise the truth will never come out, it just might take a lot of personal sacrifice to get there. I’ve lost at least a few friends since this all started and maybe if this ends we can reconnect.</p>

        <p>It feels very much like when I managed to deconvert myself from Christianity, you've looked at the information, you know why everyone else is wrong, and none of them are even willing to entertain that their ideas could be misplaced for even a moment.  It's quite frustrating.  Even the justification for why you should rejoin the fray is as bad as it was for religion "well ~~Pastor~~ Dr. Fauci says..." meanwhile, you're thinking "I don't give 2 shits what that person says, they lie constantly, back up your assertions with facts and data". and they can never do it.</p>
