    <strong>Anyone local to south Florida ?</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly I’m at my wits end here. Pre-“pandemic” I had a lot of people I could go out with. Go out to eat or drink or whatever. But everyone is terrified of this shit or just complying because they think it’ll stop this madness so I don’t have anyone around me I can really go out with anymore. </p>
<p>So TLDR I’m looking for some people in the area that also know places around that aren’t really enforcing masks. I’m cool with anyone just FYI I’m a straight guy. I’m just looking for friends in the area at this point who aren’t terrified of this shit. </p>
<p>Fair game anywhere from the keys to palm beach county. I don’t mind the drive.</p></p>

        <p>Yep, this sounds more like the South Florida I know.</p>
<p>Whenever I see people here claim Florida, especially the Miami area, is 100% normal, I raise an eyebrow. As far as I've heard, it's pretty far gone in terms of fear and paranoia.</p>

        <p>The places everyone thinks of in Florida, like Orlando or Miami, are high populated blue areas that are strict and have mask mandates, as well as other restrictions at the county or city level.</p>
<p>The less populated areas of the state are more normal, and tend not to have any mandates. In my area, there are no capacity limits, and stores have mask signs up but most of them don't enforce it that I've seen. Walmart was the biggest enforcer, with the fences and lines outside and only one entrance and exit open with a mask checker. But a few months ago they got rid of all of that and have reopened all of their entrances.</p>
<p>Some people wear masks going into restaurants as do the staff and they use disposable menus, but otherwise they are pretty back to normal, and very busy.</p>
<p>I'd say we are one of or the most normal in the country right now. I think everything has reopened as far as I can tell, including gyms and theaters.</p>
