    <strong>To all the Doomers: you can’t stop us.</strong>
    <p><p>To all the Doomers out there lurking in the shadows, trying to get us banned, living on your high horse with the delusion that you’re so morally superior because you’re still wearing a mask 500+ days later even though you’ve left children forgotten at home and the elderly abandoned and isolated, who have shamed us and ridiculed us mercilessly; it’s YOUR turn to sit down and shut up. </p>
<p>It’s the 4th of July, and all day long I’ve seen massive parties and get togethers. All the neighbors being friendly to each other and sharing food and fireworks. Fireworks galore lit up the night sky. Everywhere you turn you can see them and even now as I’m laying in bed, it sounds like rumbling thunder as they’re still going off. People don’t fucking care about covid anymore or the latest variant trend. This pandemic is over. </p>
<p>People are saying loud and clear: we don’t fucking care what scare tactics the government and msm employ next, nothing is going to stop us from doing what we love and being who we are. We were meant to be human like this and celebrate with our God-given freedoms and rights. </p>
<p>We are not going to stop fighting for freedom. We are going to bring this same energy in everything we do from now on. Doomers, better get used to it.</p></p>

        <p>I think so. People are appreciating their freedoms like they didn’t before. I know personally there’s no way I’d put a mask back on. I did it at the beginning of the pandemic, but if they tried to enforce that again, well lol good luck.</p>

        <p>One would hope and think that you are correct. For unknown reasons tho, I think the people that got vaccinated are changed forever, and no longer wish to be a part of the old normal. I am having a hard time communicating with friends and family that have been vaccinated. Anyone else noticing this?</p>

        <p>My parents (boomers) were super belligerent to me when I suggested they do some research before jumping into getting the vaccine. They scoffed at the suggestion the government might not have their best interests at heart.  I wasn't trying to discourage them, just had concerns and wanted them to do their own research first.</p>
<p>They've not had any side effects, which is great.  But what bothered me is the blind acceptance that the government and big pharma has their safety and well being at heart.  </p>
<p>I then concluded, having listened to a shit ton of boomers after that brag on getting vaxxed and how they're doing their part... that despite the thalidomide babies, despite smoking being considered safe and encouraged at one time, despite NAPALM being considered safe for our troops at one time, they still believe in the power of vaccines and the government without question.  I feel like it's because of polio being a huge threat when they were young and the miracle salvation of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Well.  My mom is... someone who leads a sedentary lifestyle and also is 'always sick'... my dad has belligerent asshole syndrome, so any time he encounters push back he tends to lapse into a belligerence episode.</p>

        <p>At this point. Those who get the vaccine are no longer relevant. This is their battle now! What more can we do for them? We tried to talk sense into them. Now we must move on with our lives. Far as I’m concerned all we can do is hope they survive, and the rest of us stay united and strong</p>

Neighbors and their families and friends, the vaxed and unvaxed, multiple races, all ages, sizes and shapes all eating, sharing grills, visiting and enjoying life.

        <p>I just had one of my comments reported for hate speech and the claim was "We've received multiple reports of your comment" basically more than one account reporting me. The thing that confuses me is how they all report the same comment? It's clear they were just abusing the system trying to get me banned. I didn't even say the word they're saying I did in the comment that was reported but Reddit is still humoring it and I may or may not lose my account as far as I know I'm not gonna but it's funny the small attempts that are made to silence us.</p>
