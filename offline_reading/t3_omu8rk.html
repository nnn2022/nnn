    <strong>Healthy discussion about viruses. What do you believe?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi! Please read only if you are able to process new information that does not match your beliefs. Feel free to call what you read nonsense, but please be ready to offer your arguments. If you’re not interested in knowledge exchange do not comment.</p>
<p>Not here to hurt anyone’s feelings or argue, just curious how many people got to the point in their research where you realize that there are no infectious diseases? I’d love to listen to your story.
Are there people who did the same research but came to a conclusion that diseases can indeed be contagious? I’d love to hear your arguments.
Maybe there are those who is still looking for the truth? I’m happy to help you to find it.</p>
<p>In March/April 2020 I first found the info that viruses are manufactured inside a persons body and help with detoxification, therefore cannot be contagious. Since then I’ve been looking for a proof of either theory, but couldn’t find any. Recently I found a community (by accident!) that answered all my questions and I feel so relieved. We follow Aajonus Vonderplanitz’ primal diet (we eat raw meat, raw milk, bacteria, parasites) and (as you can guess) do not believe in anything there 🥼👨‍⚕️ people say.</p></p>

        <p>Covid-1984 has further made me realize that we are not told the truth. </p>
<p>Covid $cientists seem to be expanding the number of symptoms, much like the “polio” and “AIDS” rackets did with regard to grouping all sorts of illnesses under a particular umbrella for profit. DDT is the main culprit behind “polio” and AIDS has some connections to drug use including nitrates.</p>
<p>Pharma is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-settlement-history-fact/purdue-oxycontin-settlement-would-rank-among-largest-in-pharma-history-idUSKCN1VW2KL">criminal</a> and re$earch mostly <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">false</a> but experimental “vaccines” made by both are good?</p>

<p><strong>SARS-CoV-2 hasn’t been isolated</strong>
https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/okzv3f/some_things_to_consider/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan states:</strong></p>
<p>“However, it turns out <strong>these photos are actually NOT corona viruses, and the CDC, among others, has known this fact since at least 2004.</strong> The above paper examines the evidence used to claim that these images represent viruses, rather than <strong>normal “structures” within a cell, particularly sick cells.</strong> Here is what the paper says:</p>
<p><strong>“We have observed morphologically indistinguishable inclusions within podocytes and tubular epithelial cells both in patients negative for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as in renal biopsies from the pre-COVID-19 era” (emphasis added).</strong></p>
<p>In other words, the <strong>researchers saw these same structures in people with no evidence of Covid</strong> and in samples they took <strong>before Covid</strong> even happened, before the virus was said to even exist. </p>
<p>In addition, they say:</p>
<p>“We postulated that <strong>endogenous mimickers could be present that are morphologically indistinguishable from SARS-CoV-2 virions ultrastructurally.”</strong></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>“Viral-like inclusions, consisting both of single vesicles with diameters between 50 and 138 nm, as well as packed groups within larger vesicles, were found in all 15 cases, either in podocytes. Tubular epithelia, or vascular epithelial cells (figure 1).”</p>
<p>In all 15 cases that they examined, they found structures identical to what is being called SARS-CoV-2.  They were scattered all over the kidneys and blood vessels; <strong>they are not viruses, but normal parts of the cells.”</strong></p>
<p>“But the final nail comes in this quote:</p>
<p>“The <strong>potential for confusion of coronavirus particles with normal cellular components was in fact highlighted in a detailed ultrastructural study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of SARS-CoV responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p>In other words, the CDC in 2004 knew that <strong>researchers couldn’t reliably know these particles were coronavirus particles. Not a word has been heard about this since.</strong> All virologists use these pictures as proof of the existence of this virus. <strong>It is a fraud, based on junk science, like everything else connected with “Covid 19.”</strong>

<p>This “isolation” issue is similar to HIV. There are (were) well-renowned scientists that have questioned the HIV/AIDS narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Problems with isolating HIV, by Etienne de Harven, MD. 12/8/03</strong>
https://altheal.org/isolation/isolhiv.htm</p>
<p><strong>Kary Mullis, PCR inventor and Fauci critic, died of</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/science/kary-b-mullis-dead.html">“pneumonia” 3 days before Epstein.</a> </p>
<p>“The following was written by Kary Mullis for the introduction to the book "Inventing the AIDS Virus" by Peter H. Duesberg (Regnery Publishing, INC; Washington DC, 1996):”http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html</p>
<p>“What ABC needs to do,” says Mullis, “is talk to Fauci and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html">Gallo</a> and <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">show that they’re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Mullis states:</strong></p>
<h2>“Guys like Fauci get up there and start talking, and he doesn’t know anything really about anything, and I’d say that to his face. Nothing.</h2>
<p>The man thinks you can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope and if it’s got a virus in there, you will know it. <strong>He doesn’t understand electron microscopy and he doesn’t understand medicine.</strong> He should not be in a position like he’s in.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got a personal kind of agenda. They make up their own rules as they go. They change them when they want to, and smugly... like <strong>Tony Fauci does not mind going on television, in front of the people that pay his salary, and lie directly into the camera.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nobel Laureate Kary Mullis Challenges The Myths About HIV</strong>
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=19sz3DocJ-Q</p>
<p><strong>Mullis on AIDS:</strong></p>
<h2>“They don’t know. Nobody really knows. This whole thing is a big sham. It’s ridiculous.”</h2>
<p><strong>Mullis asks Dr. Luc Montagnier for a reference stating ‘HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.’</strong></p>
<p>“So, I didn’t get any more out of him, he (Montagnier) walked away after that. And the people standing around, by the way who were his colleagues there, looked at him thinking like he should come up with a better answer than that but he couldn’t and he just turned around and walked away.  I really thought he’d have an answer.  I really did! I mean, that was my last... I was right at the edge of my faith in the system... <strong>but I thought Montagnier will know why he thinks HIV causes it and he will tell me, ‘it’s because of this study,’ you know? But he didn’t have that.  None of those guys have that and that’s why they’re so weird, you know? That’s why they don’t want to say... they don’t want people like me walking up and asking those kinds of questions and they’re willing to go to great lengths to prevent that.</strong> They’re out on a limb.  I wouldn’t want to be there with them.”</p>

NIH’s Fauci and Gilead’s Martin: junk science and oligarchic capitalism.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Kary Mullis states:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“All kinds of diseases started coming into the AIDS family, faster than anyone should’ve been comfortable with, really. To go from two or three to go to 30 in a few years was like somebody should’ve said, ‘hey, there’s something wrong here and it’s got to be financial.’ Things don’t happen that fast in science!</strong> You don’t suddenly notice that one new organism is causing every problem.”</p>
<p>-Kary Mullis, PCR Inventor:<br>
HIV and AIDS
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rycOLjoPbeo</p>
<p>Kary Mullis, PCR Inventor:</p>
<p><strong>”With PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody.</strong> It starts making you believe, in sort of the Buddhist notion, that everything is contained in everything else, right?  I mean, if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really measure, which PCR can do, then there’s just very few molecules that you don’t have at least one single one of them in your body, okay.  <strong>So that could be thought of as a misuse, just to claim that it’s meaningful.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>”Those tests are all based on things that are invisible and the results are inferred in a sense.</strong> PCR as separate from that... is just a process that’s used to make a whole lot of something out of something. That’s what it is.  <strong>It doesn’t tell you that you’re sick and it doesn’t tell you that the thing you ended up with was going to hurt you or anything like that.”</strong></p>
<p>-Kary Mullis: PCR

<p><strong>Dr. Peter Duesberg on the CDC:</strong></p>
<p>“For them to justify their existence and their expenses, and make their careers they have to find infectious diseases.”</p>
<p><strong>“The more diseases that they could lump into this AIDS syndrome, ‘S’ stands for Syndrome, the better the chances are they get patients under that umbrella. The more patients they could catch.”</strong></p>
<p>“They’re all prostitutes, most of them, my colleagues. To some degree myself. <strong>You have to be a prostitute to get money for your research.</strong> You’re trained a little bit to be a prostitute. But some go all the way (laughs).”</p>
<p><em>E. Richard Brown writes:</em></p>
<p><strong>”In the great majority of cases the toll of the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>"The <strong>chief credit</strong> for the conquest of the destructive epidemics ... ought to have been given <strong>to the social reformers</strong> who had campaigned for purer water, better sewage disposal and improved living standards. <strong>It had been their efforts, rather than the achievement of the medical scientists, which had been chiefly responsible for the reduction in mortality from infectious disease"</strong>. ^2:12

<p>Well good because that is exactly where I'm coming from.  You will of course kindly forgive any defensiveness.</p>
<p>A big problem this sub must continually deal with is outside questions insisting that we defend positions we may not have adopted or otherwise seem to insist that if we lack "positive proof" to back up our skepticism then we have some sort of moral obligation to trust the liars and believe their mendacity as they exploit the situation for their own purposes- likely having nothing to do with public health or ending a pandemic.</p>

        <p>Aajonus studied pharmaceutical vitamin C and found that although it works as vitamin C it is stored in our body as toxin. I believe the same goes for other vitamins and minerals. I drink veggie juices, milk and eat raw meat/seafood. Those are more nutritious than spinach or an apple, so I don’t have to worry about zinc.</p>

        <p>Honestly not even sure anymore that viruses exist.</p>
<p>I mean, we take them for granted right? We learn about them in school. Ok, they stand out, not sure if they are at all alive and in which kingdom they belong, but, they are there and they are bad right?</p>
<p>But then you ask, how do I know viruses are real? Because I've learned in school. How do the teachers know? Because they learned. How did they learn? Because somebody a long time ago came up with the idea. Here's what they did:</p>
<p>&rt;The first evidence of the existence of viruses came from experiments with filters that had pores small enough to retain bacteria. In 1892, Dmitri Ivanovsky used one of these filters to show that sap from a diseased tobacco plant remained infectious to healthy tobacco plants despite having been filtered. Martinus Beijerinck called the filtered, infectious substance a "virus" and this discovery is considered to be the beginning of virology.</p>
<p>Wait, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>the guy completely trusted the germ theory</li>
<li>his filter was only fine enough to stop bacteria</li>
<li>healthy plants got sick</li>
<li>= proof! Virus exists!</li>
</ul>
<p>God knows what was in that filtered soup! What toxins or whatever.</p>
<p>And then you figure that modern virology basically does the same, because in virology "isolated" is a very, very, very loose term which basically means "lots of nasty shit and some genetic material we call virus".</p>
<p>And then there are microbiologists who say it's all bullshit.</p>
<p>And there's so much more. It just.. doesn't really add up.</p>
<p>In essence it's all a giant religion. A layman can check existence of virus as much as we can check existence of god. And now they keep brainwashing us to "trust" science? It's eerie similar rhetoric to what religion uses.</p>

        <p>I believe in the immune system, and am old enough to remember that vaccines were invented based on the principle of natural immunity in the first place.</p>
<p>So the fact that they’re trying to change the definition of herd immunity to say it’s only achievable through vaccination is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>A person who discovered and promoted that all microorganisms are useful and the concept of immunity is erroneous because there’s no one to protect us from cured himself from serious diseases and then cured others, including last stage cancer patients. Almost all. On the other hand, the 👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️ who believe in immunity kill most of their patients. You can believe theories in books or you can believe what works on practice. The choice is yours.</p>

        <p>We've seen viruses on high-powered microscopes. They're real. Healthy people with good nutrition are less likely to get sick from them because their bodies have better immune defenses, so viruses and pathogenic bacteria aren't equally dangerous to everyone. You've never had someone in your family catch a mild illness and then other family members get it too within a week?</p>

        <p>Of course it happens, but there’s another explanation to this. A “disease” is a detoxification process. No environmental toxins, no diseases, I hope that’s clear. Family members, coworkers and people that live in one city are exposed to the same toxins, they breath the same air at least. Here you have 2 theories and I believe the one that seems more logical and more evidence-based.</p>
