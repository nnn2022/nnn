    <strong>I’m in the UK and I genuinely do not see an issue that 600 people a day are dying of flu-diseases in the height of winter</strong>
    <p><p>Flu-like diseases float around this time of year, every year, always have, and always will... and people die of them, always have, and always will. But no one has had the slightest issue with this up until 2020.</p>
<p>600 deaths a day, given the demographics (average age 82, literally older than the average age someone in the UK dies), it’s no big deal.</p>
<p>Not least because actual flu deaths are practically 0, at least officially. Covid is killing the exact same people that would have got some kind of other flu-like disease in any other year and died of it... and no one would have batted an eye.</p>
<p>Until we actually have an abnormal amount of excess deaths caused by Covid (which is never going to happen), I simply see absolutely no issue with the amount of people currently dying with it. Of course it’s sad for the families, but it’s also 100%, completely normal. Old people cannot live forever and they cannot feasibly be shielded from every risk imaginable, and even if they could be, they’d still die eventually... it’s a part of life.</p></p>

        <p>It is when it's the boomers' turn. That's literally it. It's the bulk of boomers aging into 'a cold might kill you' territory. If it wasn't  COVID, it'd be the regular flu in 5 years.</p>

        <p>100 percent. This is all driven by entitled boomers and babied Gen Z/ millennials with social problems. So many under 25s wearing masks! NO ONE would have stood for this when I was that age. There would have been riots.</p>

        <p>UK too OP</p>
<p>It's horrible but as you say it happens every year as has been shown by the headlines that have all been combined on a pic on this sub.</p>
<p>Are flu deaths zero at the minute? I imagine they are but havent looked into it.</p>
<p>We did seem to have some excess deaths in april and may and I think that was probably the actual covid. We got right on top of that.</p>
<p>Bojo on the news before even said the average age of death is 80.... 80 years old.... and everyone thinks your awful for suggesting the world should go back to normal because this is the average age of people dying...</p>
<p>Needless to say I 100% agree with what you have said. People die, especially elderly and the ill.</p>
<p>Also, deaths have been average of 450- 500 per day since november even when case rate was increasing at an exponential rate. </p>
<p>Its properly madness</p>

        <p>Something I never hear suggested as a reason for large excess deaths in March/April was the amount of NHS staff self isolating.</p>
<p>I have a close family member who works as a nurse, at the beginning of the pandemic, 40% of them were self isolating at once.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder an excess amount of people die when at the click of a finger, with no preparation or contingency, half of the frontline staff looking after dying people disappear for two weeks.</p>
<p>I would bet that most of those excess deaths were people either in palliative care or in an intensive state all just dropping dead at once from being neglected. One day there’s going to be an inquest into it.</p>

        <p>The thing is, Covid treatment has actually remained almost identical throughout (ventilators and a bog standard drip).</p>
<p>PCR tests are still crap now, let alone the first ones to market.</p>

        <p>Back in April we were getting 800-1000 deaths some days but now it's blending into the background rates of death. 1500 people normally die every day anyway. Yet deaths from other causes are down too. So deaths is gonna be lower than 2019 levels.</p>

        <p>In the UK too. The narrative is that 100k will be dead in a month. That 'old people matter too'...well duh. OF COURSE they do. But when did you care before? Thousands die every year from flu and NO ONE CARES. The reality is that people are scared and the media is encouraging it. That's why I can't take it seriously.</p>

<p>This has death numbers and a heat map of age. Albeit it’s now updated with today’s deaths and is now 700 dead within 28 days of a positive test (which is such a dumb way to measure deaths in the first place), yesterday was 600.</p>

<p>Prince Charles in the second video states, "the pandemic has made people susceptible to change." What? Lockdowns?</p>
<p>Of course, there are those at the top of the pyramid that who require this madness to continue as it serves their globalist interests. Anyone who believes this is about saving life is absolutely deluded. If it were, the health service would have been adequately funded but instead, it's overwhelmed every single winter, COVID or not.</p>
<p>I believe the virus is real, of course, it is because if it wasn't, we'd absolutely know about it by now. But it's a virus that the elites have been wanting to happen for a very long time to push radical change in the name of climate change and advancing towards the end goals of the UN's Agenda 30. This is now a political weapon. A psyop of sorts.</p>
<p>Never trust a government to keep you safe. Because they want you to pay for it. With your liberty.</p>

        <p>A Godzilla sized strawman. Reread what I said and point out where I said Covid was fake or that I’m anti-vaccine.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s 600 families grieving, yes it’s sad, but it’s unavoidable. Over 80s die of infectious diseases, broken hips, cancer, strokes, Alzheimer’s and everything else under the Sun eventually.</p>
<p>Most of the deaths were people already nearing death, at worst, Covid shortened their life by months, at best, it wasn’t actually even Covid that killed them but the thing they were dying of anyway.</p>
<p>If you’re going act like this response is even remotely proportionate, or if you’re going to morally grandstand and call everyone selfish etc. etc. let me ask you this?</p>
<p>Have you ever called for the closure of schools over winter? Have you ever went to work, school, or met up with a friend while you have a sniffle? Have you ever went outside for a non-essential activity with a sniffle? Have you ever done a normal life activity whilst feeling under the weather? Well, apologies to break it to you, but you’re responsible for old people dying. That’s what it means to ‘all be in this together’, isn’t it?</p>

        <p>Isn’t the entire point of lockdown that we protecting the vulnerable and those of us who don’t abide are selfish and putting lives at risk? The reason we’re closing schools is because what if little Timmy takes Covid home to grandma.</p>
<p>We have all been getting told for months now by the Covid preachers that we’re responsible for deaths if we don’t follow the rules. I am simply highlighting that literally no one ever used that logic pre-March 2020. That’s the point I was making.</p>
<p>And no, I’m not saying I don’t care that people are dad. It’s sad that people die all the time. I’m saying at a certain age it’s unavoidable and you shouldn’t take such draconian measures just to possibly preserve someones life for 6 months longer. The same way if there was a £100 million treatment that could lengthen a single person’s life by 6 months, I don’t think the NHS should use it. Not because I don’t care about that person’s life, but because it’s such a disproportionate measure.</p>

        <p>If there's one thing we shouldn't do it's follow health advice from 100 years ago. We learned. It was not in the pandemic advice before 2020 because it was proven ineffective for flu (which spreads the same way) and we haven't changed our mind because of new evidence. The only RCT study on masks and covid is <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">here</a> and it couldn't prove they were effective either.</p>

        <p>We don't know that. We have no idea how we'll our measures worked because what would have happened with none is just a guess. We do know and knew from the start how much damage prolonging measures would do, we knew that lockdown would take lives. Through poverty, suicide, overdose, untreated cancer, isolation, starvation...we caused these deaths. We could have saved these people, and while we may have saved some of the people who would've died from covid, these people were almost all at risk people and remain as at risk with or without covid. I propose we give the at risk the option to isolate, but no forcing anyone because we've seen the damage that's caused.</p>

I've seen video footage from China in August of a mad rave with thousands of people with no masks.  I've gotten reports of 80 person house parties in Sweden.

        <p>Of course we have more cases than in previous years. We hadn't come across covid until late 2019. Imagine how many less deaths from poverty, suicide, overdose, serious diseases like cancer gone untreated, and suffering from domestic abuse, mental struggle, financially and on the list goes if we hadn't locked down? We aren't saving lives, we're trading them. This is a serious problem because we're trading in the lives of young and healthy people for the lives of elderly and vulnerable people, who still remain elderly and vulnerable with or without covid. The simple truth is we don't know what would have happened with no measures, but we knew from the start what damage the measures themselves would do if used for more than a couple weeks.</p>

        <p>It wouldn’t be any different.  This has been covered by scientists and doctors.  Lockdowns have effect on the data curves.  You need to provide some substance here if you’re going claim it would be worse with out lockdowns.  Lockdowns aren’t the normal response until this past year.  Lockdowns are the experiment.</p>
