    <strong>The Harm Done to Disabled People through all this was IMMENSE. They broke ADA</strong>
    <p><p>The post about not being able to hear got me started on this and how deaf and HOH people have suffered from Covid and all the masks. I posted on that how the masks made me fully deaf with no lip reading.</p>
<p>I am on the autistic spectrum, when I had my groups taken away, that was the majority of my social interaction with other people besides my husband. It is hard for me to make friends though I do have some long distance friends and had friends in an old rural town [some are deceased]</p>
<p>It is far harder for autistic people to use Zoom, having the camera on me can be painful, I do turn it off at times. I adapted. However this is not the same as seeing people.</p>
<p>Some of you have friends who live local who you can go see. I don't. I was isolated somewhat from being autistic before, outside of marriage, and depended on groups. Social interaction WIPED away. I have only seen my husband, clerks, a few people dropping things off from my liberal church, doctors and nurses in 1.5 years.  I am realizing how my life has been immensely harmed depending so much on structured social activities. There is no in person disability group--yes I went to that, no art classes, etc.</p>
<p>I have bad lungs, wearing the masks is painful. I do believe the virus is real though PCR numbers were cooked up a bit. So am in the damned if I do or damned if I don't. So I wear KN95 in stores, I go in and rip it off outside. Most stores still require masks here anyway. However I had scary events, where I could not breathe, it is very hard to breathe through the masks. I was in an art store I have to walk further on my walker to get some painting supplies, and was wearing KN95, and could not breathe and had to rush out and rip it off outside store, so husband could finish paying. I think the masks do harm my health. I cannot tolerate them more than an 1-2 hours. If I went into a hospital and they wanted me to keep one on for more then that time, I could not do it. I get short of breathe even in the hospital masks though they are thinner. This has been a year of pain and misery from that alone. I know as an unvaxxed person I will be forced most places to wear a mask.</p>
<p>So couple shortness of breathe without being able to hear anyone. What a thrill right?</p>
<p>I have other conditions too adversely affected by Covid but don't want to get into those. In my case I did manage to keep my medical care going but I think the only reason is because I have specialized doctors that deal with the extremely disabled. I did have some scans delayed for 6-8 months. One close friend is fighting and could be dying of stage 4 cancer, because she was scared to go out to a doctor for months with symptoms, I remember trying to talk her into it. I thought it was something like colitis or other stomach problems. </p>
<p>There are no medical exemptions for the vaxx, no matter how sick you are or extreme autoimmune diseases etc. I even wonder if they are trying to talk terminally ill people into getting it. That alone is breaking ADA to the max. I have a family history of pericarditis and extreme autoimmune disease in my case I've brought up. They don't care. Line up no matter your risk. At least most doctors are leaving me alone and one brought it up only once. But you ever think about that how no one has medical exemption that's messed up.</p>
<p>Think of mental disabilities too like PTSD, , people unable to see therapists in person or support groups etc....</p></p>

        <p>Yes, those programs probably have been devestated. It is not the same to see a sponsor via a computer. No drug and alcohol program. No support groups for depression, I was in a self help group for some years that was defunct, but Covid would have destroyed it.</p>

        <p>I think there have been a lot of already disadvantaged groups that have been negatively impacted by the covid restrictions and mask requirements (and the reliance on zoom). Iâ€™m hoping that some of that will become easier in the near future (?!). </p>
<p>If you still need it wear a mask to go into stores, have you tried a cloth one or one of the basic surgical ones? I find those easier to breathe in than the kn95s.</p>

        <p>I'm so sick of people saying "I have asthma and I can breathe through the mask just fine."</p>
<p>Well I have asthma and I can't. People can't be that stupid that they don't understand that illnesses are on a spectrum. Some are well controlled, some aren't. I remember being in a grocery store once with an N95 on and had the uncontrollable urge to cough. I ran through the store panicking, because I was afraid to cough in front of anyone. I was looking for an aisle with no one in it so I could cough.  didn't want them thinking I had Covid. I was even starting to question that myself. As soon as I took it off the cough went away. At first I thought there were chemicals in the mask from manufacturing. I actually think it was an accumulation of carbon dioxide (which is very real).  </p>
<p>I cannot believe gyms were making people wear them. I had a really bad asthma attack at the gym once with no mask. I can't even imagine. Even if I took it super easy. Plus the extra heat and humidity can't be good.</p>
<p>This is all gonna come out. They are gonna rub it in our faces that masks are not only useless, but dangerous for the application they were being used for. They get off on laughing at us. I've even heard some say it's like an esoteric thing where they get more power from telling us what they did. So if we don't use our free will to stop them, we've basically consented.</p>

        <p>I used to belong to Planet Fitness, we are still paying for it, maybe we are insane, because I want to go back, but I can't go with masks required. If I walk too fast, I can't breathe in the masks, I am on a walker but yes I went to a gym to lift weights and do arm bicycle machine, rope exercises, other machines, kettle bells. My health has suffered with no gym, but I know there's no way I could breathe for any cardio with a hospital mask on. Yeah one can get asthma even if it's too hot or exercise induced, I've been asthmatic all my life and have COPD [never smoked] its combination of severe asthma and autoimmune problems.  Yeah I've gotten scared hiding out, to hold coughs in. I worry about masks harming people's lungs. I am noticing my husband is coughing more and he does more of the shopping. We only wear masks for short intervals, he works at home, and I only wear them in public or stores, and I feel like stuff has happened to our lungs and if I had to wear a mask more then a short period of time, I would be sick. I think they are dangerous more and more. I am scared of catching whatever virus is out there due to high risk, so have been put in a bad position here. I think they do gain power by the consent too. They basically are telling people what they plan, and that increases the power too. Of course I am just a crazy CoNsPIraCY tHeOriSt, even though all you have to do is look outside to see how they screwed all our lives, probably for good.</p>

        <p>Planet fitness is the gym I belonged too also. I think people are actually catching Covid and other respiratory illnesses from the masks. Unless you change it very often and use sanitary practices (let's face it, no one does), they are keeping germs near your face and in your air stream.  This has been demonstrated in real world situations time after time. At my work, there was an outbreak of Covid, but the only people who got it were people who constantly were wearing masks, even in the car alone. The people who didn't get it were the one's who would only wear it when a supervisor was around.</p>

        <p>I spent 40 bucks a week on masks, we change them though husband needs to change his more often and honestly that may be impossible for us to afford in the future. I think the masks are harming people's lungs, I've been wearing them less and less, not outside at all whipping it off whereever I don't have to legally wear it. I am worried about the masks affecting my immune system adversely even from flus and colds. I did stuff like drop a piece of food on the floor and ate it, because I wanted the immune system to have something to "work on". LOL</p>

        <p>thanks for this post, im sorry this year has been hard on you, it's been hard for me too, I had severse ptsd and cant/really shouldnt wear a mask. I get flashbacks, blackouts, and have attacked people before without remembering it. Having something over my face is really dangerous and no one believes me. It's so surreal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank god though, because I reached out to my local NNN protest for support and they told me about how the PCR test was fake etc. and i was warned about the vax. So i'm grateful in that sense.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Yes PTSD can be severe in all this. Anyone with PTSD or CPTSD problems in this nightmare are struggling. I can understand where something over the face is dangerous in your case. I am glad you found a local NNN protest, I am searching in my case. I am glad I found this website and read websites warning about the vax too. They have saved lives. I hope things get better for you. They have really harmed people on untold levels.</p>

        <p>thanks so much (: I think it will be difficult to get out of the situation I'm in, but I'm ready to thrive if I am able to move, so hopefully that isn't too far away</p>

        <p>As a fellow autistic, I totally get this. My social life has always been precarious, and then it was wiped away entirely. I don't know for sure what long term consequences this will have, but it won't be good in the least....</p>

        <p>Thanks, It's too bad you are going through this too. I was getting somewhere via groups on the social life, felt finally stable, and feeling hope, happiness and then this happened. Yeah mine has been wiped away entirely. I'm twisted in knots over my refusing the vaxx and not feeling safe to be in person with groups yet too. It's painful but I won't take the vaxx.  Yeah I am thinking of long term consequences for myself, the isolation has harmed my mental health already. I hope yours are not severe.</p>
