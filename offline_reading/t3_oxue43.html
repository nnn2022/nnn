        <p>For the TLDR and ELI5 people:</p>
<p>There's a chance that those who didn't take any precautions against COVID or didn't seek medical treatment fast enough were already lacking when it came to cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Basically some folks "stupid-ed" their way into getting ventilated by not wearing a mask, not social distancing, and putting themselves into situations where they could receive a high viral load.</p>
<p>It's possible that COVID reduces cognitive ability, but this study didn't show it.</p>

        <p>Can you point out specifically where the study matches up with your “ELI5?” Because your summary looks completely incorrect. You must’ve had COVID I guess.</p>

        <p>This study is cross-sectional and doesn't measure decline. </p>
<p>It merely compares cognitive performance of people who have had COVID to people who haven't. </p>
<p>It's also possible that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People who have less cognitive ability, which other research has shown predicts poorer health behaviors like not wearing a mask, are more likely to get COVID. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because viral load confers greater symptoms, people with even poorer cognitive ability to begin with, could have gotten higher viral load exposures (due to for example, not wearing a mask).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore cognition could show an association with severity that is not due to COVID actually doing anything to cognitive ability.</p>
<p>The authors tried to address this in two ways, but both attempts are pretty poor. </p>
<p><em>First</em>, they tried to show <em>that people who got COVID later didn't differ in cognition from people who didn't get it</em> (they assessed COVID status twice, but cognition only once), but this can be explained by cohort effects such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>At an initial wave of infections, health behaviors may have played a prominent role in who ended up getting COVID, but by a later time point, COVID may have been so widespread that health behaviors didn't play as much of a role, thereby removing cognition-related differences in infection likelihood. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Second</em>, they estimated premorbid cognitive ability based on demographic factors alone (?!) and found that in estimated premorbid cognitive ability, people who got COVID had higher estimated premorbid cognitive ability. </p>
<p><strong><em>But,</em></strong> <em>young adult age is associated with better cognition</em> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <em>it's strongly associated with a higher chance of getting COVID, so their premorbid estimates are meaningless and terribly confounded.</em></p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>It's possible that COVID reduces cognitive ability, but this study didn't show it at all.</p>
<pre><code>       And no, I and mine are COVID negative.
</code></pre>

        <p>I’m trying to understand your point here. Unless I’m not seeing it, the study you posted says nothing about cognitive decline comparing people who did or did not wear masks, social distance, etc, but you are inferring it based on some other study? This study only compares cognitive ability between people who have had COVID with various severity and people who have not had COVID. It seems to be suggesting that COVID is what caused the decline, but like you said it can’t really prove that since the tests were only taken once and not pre and post COVID. I just don’t get where you are coming to the conclusion that this study shows that people “stupid-ed” themselves into getting ventilated because they didn’t wear a mask. Where does it say the “stupid” ones weren’t taking proper precautions?</p>

        <p>&rt; People who have less cognitive ability, which other research has shown predicts poorer health behaviors like not wearing a mask</p>
<p>This is a generality due to the lowering of one's ability to assess risk.  It's not a moral judgement. </p>
<p>The point comes up in regard to the lack of the study's ability to accurately assess decline.</p>
<p>They've merely compared cognitive performance of people who have had COVID to people who haven't.</p>
<p>While the study is interesting, it is statistically lacking in it's attempt to characterize it's data set as inferential with regard to cognitive decline  among COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>The most likely cause, if indeed that is the case, is going to be from steps taken during care of those patients that were intubated.</p>

        <p>So basically the point of this thread is not the study itself, but your own opinion on why the study shows what it shows. Alright, I guess I get it now. At first I thought you misunderstood the study you posted, which was why I replied.</p>

        <p>I can only speculate on specific causes, but it has been documented that tiny blood clots (a form of DIC) can cause damage to the delicate brain tissue connected to those vessels that are clogged up by these micro thromboemboli and as such can lead to degeneration of that tissue which then causes mental decline.</p>
<p>That's the theory I am speculating on. There are other causes such as loss of oxygen perfusion levels needed to sustain proper brain function and therefore cognitive function.</p>
<p>To some extent there is neurogenesis, but in the case of substantial areas of tissue being lost it won't have much effect. The main way in which this cognitive decline will recover is through rewiring and plasticity. Obviously plasticity tends to be lower in the age group that is at risk of needing ventilation.</p>
