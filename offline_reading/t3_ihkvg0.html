        <p>Welp...whatever comes down the pipe, I’ll go down shooting. </p>
<p>5 million new gun sales in the last 2 months in the US. The US has more privately owned guns than our military or any standing army in the world. They’re gonna have a hell of a fight in the US. All these riots have done is make Americans more protective of the 2nd amendment. So good luck to the cabal. We will at least make them really have to work for it.</p>

        <p>When a politician tells you, "You don't need an AR-15!"...</p>
<p>That means you need <em>two</em> AR-15's. Personally, I have three...</p>

        <p>My entire family is arsenal-level strapped. I’m the least strapped with a Ruger SR9C but that’s because I’ve always lived with friends with a lot of people coming and going and don’t have the space for a safe for an AR. But I’m buying a place late next year and my parents already set aside an AR &amp; a safe for me as a house warming gift LOL but seriously my mom alone could arm half her town with the Arsenal she and her husband have and the rest of their town could also arm the rest of their town with their arsenals. I think the government grossly underestimates what people have in their homes and the people threatening to take violence into neighborhoods DEFINITELY underestimate it. And those that want the new world order really just don’t have a fucking clue how well most of us would sleep after shooting someone to defend what’s ours. That’s just facts.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, I'd have dismissed these arguments out of hand but the current disaster is so determined to be bad that sooner or later, you have to conclude that this is deliberate and not an accident. </p>
<p>I agree the desire for a global police state is what the billionaire classes want - one in which we, as serfs, are utterly disposable and when we can stop dreaming of ever being allowed to join them in power over our own destinies.</p>
