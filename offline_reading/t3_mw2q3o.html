    <strong>My doctor is great.</strong>
    <p><p>I recently went for a checkup since I haven‚Äôt been to the doc in ages. </p>
<p>We started talking about Covid and I told him that I would not be getting vaccinated. </p>
<p>He nodded and said that I don‚Äôt need the vaccine since I‚Äôm young, healthy and fit (I used to work at the gym as a PT before this corona hysteria and exercise regularly to distract myself from this clown world). I explained that a lot of people have been telling me that I should get vaccinated to keep old/vulnerable people safe and he said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù. </p>
<p>We chatted for a bit and he said that I should continue doing what I do and had nothing to worry about. It was such a relief <em>not</em> to be gaslit by a health professional. For once I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being lied to.</p></p>

        <p>Right, but this is nnn. If people can go about their lives after they get a vaccine that's to be celebrated. I don't expect the totality of everything to have the same rules, but where the rules are logically consistent that's good news!</p>

        <p>You are the type of virgin that would get knocked out in real life if you talked the way you do on the internet. Let me give you a news flash, you aren't as intelligent as you think. You look like an idiot arguing with someone who agrees with you because that "wasnt your point." Meanwhile, you're arguing what he said is "logically consisent" and yet, what you said is also logically consistent when someone says "well thats only cause we haven't reached herd immunity." You need a reality check kid. The fact that you actually commented on me being new here is hysterical, further proving how much of a pompous douche you are.</p>

        <p>Doesn't change what you said? I want you to take a moment and use this thing you have called your brain, to do something called thinking. First, let's leave aside the previous programming you have where you saw other people use the term "projecting" as a rebuttal to someone insulting another. I know that instead of thinking for yourself, your robot brain jumped to "hey, yeah! projecting! that makes sense! He really showed him!" From then on, you thought it would be a good response to add to your arsenal when times arise on the internet. </p>
<p>Now let's take a moment to break this down logically. By projecting, you obviously mean that the person dishing out said insult, typically embodies or suffers from that vary problem. So tell me, if I was a virgin, why on earth would I walk around calling other people virgins? Don't you think if I was a virgin and was insecure about it, that I'd typically avoid that topic at all costs? If someone was clearly obese, do you truly believe they would go around calling others fat? </p>
<p>You obviously don't know how insults work. It is true that sometimes people lack self-awareness and end up accusing someone of things they do themselves. Or perhaps they speak too quickly without considering their own position in the world. However, generally, that doesn't happen with things as black and white as virginity. To suggest it does based on very little context, makes you look like a rather low IQ individual. Hope you learned something today kid, keep up the good work.</p>

        <p>That's......not how herd immunity works. Or how vaccines work.</p>
<p>Vaccines make it so you're less like to get sick, but also make it so your body is more able to fight off the disease if you still get it.</p>
<p>If it's harder for 87% (not a real stat, just an example) of the population to get sick, and the others who couldn't get vaxxed are staying socially distanced, wearing masks, and don't get sick or transmit sickness, then we can begin to reintegrate society because there is a lesser chance for EVERYONE to have and transmit the illness.</p>

        <p>Did...did you not read the part about beginning to reintegrate society once Covid is almost gone? We do this so that we can get back to not having to wear a mask at all times. You are all about "no new normal." Because of people refusing to vaccinate, refusing to distance, refusing to mask up, this could go on who knows how long.</p>
<p>If people would just listen to covid restrictions and follow them and get the vaccine, then we could get back to how things were before - not needing a mask at all times, being able to have gatherings, but still being aware of how our reactions to crises can affect the world around us.</p>

<p>It can go on for twenty years for all I care. No matter how long it lasts, I am going to continue to disregard lockdowns, masking, and distancing protocols, like I have been disregarding this whole time.</p>
<p>With each passing day of lockdowns, more and more people adopt the "fuck this shit, im out" attitude and start flaunting the lockdown.  Hence more and more states recently lifted their distancing and mask mandates (despite the "experts" whining that the pandemic isn't over yet). </p>
<p>So, please, continue to threaten us with prolonging lockdowns. The more people who start to disregard the mandates, the better. We are going back to normal whether you like it or not, whether you're safe or not.</p>

        <p>Look. I get that the point of this is to drop r0. You're not talking to an idiot. </p>
<p>The cost of the restrictions and lockdowns is not zero so the calculus on all these civil liberty restrictions needs to be updated for vaccinated people. If we're vaccinating then the vaccinated need to be able to get back to it. If the vaccine doesn't meaningfully change the probability of catching/transmitting to the point where people can go about their lives once vaccinated then we sure as hell better not be talking about mandatory vaccines and vaccine passports. We also might as well give the fuck up in that case because this puppy is endemic and people have enough info to make their own risk assessment.</p>

        <p>The problem with that is that the vaccine isn't a cure. All it does is help to mitigate spread. Because vaccines aren't mandatory, the people who DON'T get them are still propagating the spread of the virus, meaning a vaccinated person is still potentially at risk of contracting and spreading the disease through no fault of their own, and possibly without knowing due to the vaccine making it possible they show no symptoms.</p>
<p>The only way to hinder or stop the spread is for people to not put themselves into a position to contracts it. That means vaccination and distancing until enough people are vaccinated that any remaining spread would be minimal.</p>

        <p>That's fine if the costs of these actions were zero. If people's fundamental freedoms weren't being stepped on. I'm not saying if you're vaccinated you should go cough on everyone you run into on the street, but have a pint with your friend, go on a vacation, take communion at church. Stop sitting in your apartment alone. You've done that long enough.</p>

        <p>Freedom of assembly, and freedom of movement for sure, freedom of religion. If we're talking vaccine passports, right to bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>Less fundamental, but businesses are still shut down. Cuomo used the pandemic as an excuse to go after synagogues so there's that. People have been out of work for a long time. The government shouldn't actually be able to tell you to wear a mask (that should be up to the businesses you're at).</p>

        <p>Because nothing's 100% effective, yeah.</p>
<p>Getting the vaccine drastically reduces transmission rates, which protects other people.</p>
<p>But it's not perfect.  So until herd immunity is reached, and the virus dies out or becomes much less common, masking still helps.  The best/first line of defense is getting vaccinated.</p>

<p>We've never had the freedom to harm others.  People are free to move and assemble, as long as they aren't harming others in the process.</p>

<p>Neither is the cost to human life/health. </p>
<p>&rt; Balance the benefits against the now reduced costs because people are being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Yep, that's what they're doing.  And a common-sense way to help businesses is to allow access to vaccinated people.  That's why the whole "no vaccine passports!" thing is so incredibly unhelpful and anti-business.  Businesses should be allowed ways to operate safely -- both for their customers and their employees.</p>

<p>Vaccine passports. We will never agree on this. I will never cave and accept a two-tiered system of rights. What does your system do about people who need medical or religious exemptions? Are they allowed to shop ever or are they just vectors and can't shop safely? What about businesses who won't require passports. Are they allowed to not require them? The litmus test here is the Colorado Baker case. Do you think the courts were right in deciding against him?</p>

<p>That's the whole problem with COVID, though -- you can be spreading the virus before you feel sick or get tested.  So the only way to effectively stop the spread and get ahead of the virus is to basically act like you're already infected -- because for all you know, you could be.  The countries that took COVID seriously and shut everything down are now back open 100%, because they assumed that they all had the virus and avoided exposing each other.</p>
<p>Now, obviously if you have a confirmed infection, you're likely to be even more strictly quarantined than if it's not confirmed.  That's because some reasonable compromises were already made -- things like being able to buy groceries as long as you wear a mask and keep your distance, etc.</p>
<p>&rt; I will never cave and accept a two-tiered system of rights. </p>
<p>When talking about COVID and rights, it's important to understand the context of what we're talking about.</p>
<p>For example:  Do you think people have the right to walk down a street with a gun and shoot bullets in random directions?   Why, or why not?  They're not targeting anybody specifically, but what they're doing is overtly dangerous and could get other people killed.  Does this person have a right to do that?  What about the rights of the people living on that street, that don't want to be killed from stray bullets?</p>
<p>The same is true for any infectious disease like COVID.  Whenever you are around other people, you're exposing them to risk and the possibility of death.  In this example, having a "vaccine passport" is like proving that you're responsible and won't be firing a gun in random directions, which naturally opens up a lot of doors in terms of places you can safely visit without harming other people.</p>
<p>&rt; What does your system do about people who need medical or religious exemptions?</p>
<p>Ask yourself that same question in the context of the neighborhood shooter.  Should somebody be allowed to fire off a gun randomly if they have a health reason that prevents them from putting the gun down?  What if their religion tells them that they have to fire those bullets?</p>
<p>Ultimately, neither health issues or religion can be used as an excuse to harm other people.  If somebody wants to do something overtly dangerous, then they have to go somewhere that people won't get hurt to do it, rather than just hurting people and shrugging it off.</p>
<p>&rt; The litmus test here is the Colorado Baker case. Do you think the courts were right in deciding against him?</p>
<p>That case went to the Supreme Court, and they didn't rule against him.  He was never forced to bake that cake or anything.</p>
<p>But do companies have the right to allow people into their stores while shooting guns off randomly?  (To continue the risk/danger analogy)  I sort've doubt it.  I think most people would avoid those businesses.  But the problem with pandemics is that things don't stay contained based on one person's decisions.  So if one person decides to visit a bar without a mask, they could get sick and spread the disease to somebody at a grocery store that's trying to be safe, etc.  So in a pandemic, we're not just making choices for ourselves, we're directly making choices that affect other people's lives.</p>

<p>No solution is "perfect"...there's risk in everything we do just by existing. Seatbelts, airbags, and defensive driving all <em>help</em>, but you're never risk-free when you drive. So shall we return to the horse-and-carriage until all chances of car fatalities are reduced to zero? After all, we're not just putting ourselves at danger--we're putting innocent people in danger on the road too. You'd have to be a total selfish sociopath to argue with that, right?  </p>
<p>In this example, or almost any other, it's easy to see the absurdity. The only way to avoid all risk is by ceasing to exist.   </p>
<p>Even in this case: at first we all had the impression that the vaccine was going to be the "ticket" to the "old normal"...even if 65-70% effective; at that point people could choose what level risk they wished to take. But now, even supposedly at 94% effective, people are still using "perfect" in this obsessive-compulsive sense. That's absolutely nauseating--it's become expected that we're going to walk around in masks until the chances are down to absolute zero.  </p>
<p>And by the way...it's widely agreed that "herd immunity" is not happening, especially in the U.S. Nor is the virus dying out--smallpox is the only one in history that ever has, and this one has become far too widespread. An endemic seems inevitable, because mutant strands will always find a way around the vax.</p>
<p>So there you have it: I guess we'll be masking up for life. And how dare we be selfish and immature enough to object. Normal exchange of facial expressions, touching, affection &amp; flirting; natural wholesome oxygen when outside; interacting to the degree that's necessary for most children, adolescents, and young adults to stay sane and grounded--they're all just temporary pleasures!! Even when they compromise our immune system to make the mutants spread even more rapidly...who cares?! If one precious sanctified life is saved, then it's worth the misery, isolation, suicide, poverty, and wasted lives of hundreds of thousands! </p>
<p>YEAH, WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER BABY! THANKS FOR SETTING US STRAIGHT!</p>

<p>Nobody's suggesting that we avoid <strong>all</strong> risk.  The goal in a pandemic is always to get the virus to either burn itself out entirely, or become manageable and non life-threatening.</p>
<p>In this case, the vaccine still hasn't been rolled out to everybody, and we don't know how bad the mutated viruses are yet, so it makes sense to take precautions until the problem has been fully dealt with.</p>
<p>&rt; That's absolutely nauseating--it's become expected that we're going to walk around in masks until the chances are down to absolute zero.</p>
<p>That's just not a thing.</p>
<p>Once enough people are vaccinated the CDC will lift their masking recommendations and we'll see things fully open up again.  Nobody at the CDC expects this to go away 100%.</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree -- it's going to be around for a long time.  And with vaccines, COVID is survivable for almost everybody.  But we're not all vaccinated yet.</p>
<p>The best case scenario is that most people get vaccinated, and COVID becomes a boring/non-lethal virus like the flu.</p>
<p>&rt; So there you have it: I guess we'll be masking up for life.</p>
<p>Now you're just being a drama llama.  =P  Nobody's asking you to mask up for life.</p>

        <p>You're getting the vaccine when you're eligible? Oh i see... you're mad that getting the vaccine won't relinquish your apparent need to wear a mask and social distance (which is only in your head). That's why you commented on the ridiculousness of getting the vax to protect others but still having to lockdown. I see.. I assume most that upvoted your commented were under the impression that you aren't actually a complete idiot pretending to be on our side. </p>
<p>Surgical masks dont keep people from breathing? Really? Covering the organs involved in inhalation/ exhalation has no affect on respiration? Interesting. You do know that just because oxygen molecules are small enough to pass through a mask doesnt mean it has no effect on ventilation right? Great job contributing to the clown world.</p>

        <p>Our side? This is for discussion and skepticism about lockdowns and the pandemic. There's no side. The people here range from supporters of all the measures to whackos who think that COVID is made up and 5g+vaccine= mind control. </p>
<p>I don't think it's ridiculous to get a vaccine to protect others, but it actually has to be effective enough to stop you from being a vector, not just keep your infection from being as bad as it could have been. That's where my original comment comes from. Requiring a vaccine or vaccine passports under that condition is logically incoherent. </p>
<p>And no surgical masks don't keep you from breathing. Are they uncomfortable? Sure. Do you notice for sure if you had garlic for lunch? Yep. </p>
<p>Are you concerned for welders, rescue divers, surgeons or anyone else who wears a mask for much longer periods of time in a professional capacity? How come they aren't dropping like flies from respiratory distress. </p>
<p>Can you confirm a hypothesis for me? Do you smoke pot and/or cigarettes?</p>

        <p>The subreddit reads "no new normal." Its very clear the position of the sub from the title alone. Anyone here that would willingly take the vaccine is clearly lost, as the vaccine is a large part of the "new normal."</p>
<p>You just said that you will be getting the vaccine when you're eligible. Now you state ", but it actually has to be effective enough to stop you from being a vector, not just keep your infection from being as bad as it could have been. That's where my original comment comes from." So does that mean you do believe its effective enough to do all that? If so, help me understand why you made your initial comment, because it's still not making any sense. </p>
<p>I'm noticing a trend that you appear to think arguing semantics will help you maintain your position. Define "keep you from breathing" and maybe we can continue the discussion. Am I concerned with welders and rescue divers? Why would i be concerned with someone who knows well what type of equipment is clearly required to do their job? Why would you ask if I'm concerned? Do you want to argue that their equipment has no ill effects on their health? Formulate better questions. </p>
<p>"How come they aren't dropping like flies from respiratory distress." When did anyone argue that masks are lethal?  Here, let me show you how to formulate a relevant question: does something have to be lethal to have negative health affects? </p>
<p>I'm completely sober of all drugs and alcohol for over 5 years buddy. I also eat a 100% home made, organic, whole food, plant based diet for over 5 years. Hence why I have absolutely no desire to get a vaccine, and your mcdonalds eating dumb ass does.</p>

        <p>Since when have vaccines been a last resort? Vaccines are the only thing we have currently to directly fight against viruses. Preventing them from attacking your body and killing you. </p>
<p>Also, if vaccines are only supposed to be used as a last resort, then why do we get them first. If you do any amount of thinking, you can very easily disprove this mistake of a comment.</p>

You should be asking yourself those very questions before you blatantly spew nonsense. 
Another one to consider, how did the human population climb to over a billion before the first vaccine ever invented. Because its the only thing preventing viruses? Give your head a shake.</p>

        <p>I don't expect you to read and comprehend this, but here we go.</p>
<p>The reason why we reached over a billion people is because our birth rate exceeded our mortality rate it isn't hard to understand it is math if we had vaccines then there would be more people alive, simple as that.</p>
<p>I said previously we only have vacancies to directly fight against viruses yes we have medicines but those are for the damages that the viruses cause not a preventer or cure. Unless we have some new breakthrough that I don't know about vaccines are our best way of dealing with viruses.</p>

        <p>Ok doomer, i dont expect you read, much less  comprehend this but here we go....</p>
<p>Viruses have existed far longer than humans on earth. For almost all of that time, we have not only lived together but thrived. </p>
<p>To this day, human mortality by means of viral infection accounts for but a tiny fraction, mostly of people who are very aged, or of very poor general health. </p>
<p>The notion that a vaccine is required or is even a good idea to deal with viruses is absurd. OP's doctor confirms this. In fact, many have.</p>
<p>Up until the time this C-19 panic theater ensued, it was common knowledge that a good diet, exercise, and taking care of yourself to maintain a properly functioning immune system was the best way to combat such threats. </p>
<p>AS WE HAVE DONE FOR ALL OF TIME.</p>
<p>If you bought into the hysteria and panic by lighting your hair on fire because your scared of an easily dealt with virus which is probably little more than a flu variant, you do you. Please leave me ( and the rest of us ) out of your sad, delusional, farce, as it seems you have entered the 2020's by checking your brain at the door.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you don't want to vaccine because  you're paranoid about some deep government conspiracy, then just live in  paranoia don't peddle these false narratives that vaccine are bad and  mask don't work bulllshit.</p>
<p>I fail to see how the OP was peddling the "government conspiracy" or living Paranoia Land. All the OP mentioned was that he's not getting the vaccine, and he exercises. Did we miss something here?</p>
<p>Secondly, modern medicine has not withstood the test of time that traditional medicine has. It is not to say that all of modern is bad. The break through with surgeries, out patient procedures that would have landed patients days or weeks in the hospital now you can recover in mere weeks or months. </p>
<p>You give too much credit to modern medicine in general, and have not looked at the experimental medicine aspect of it. This is very disingenuous of you to over look this knowing full well these "treatments" carry dangerous side effects. Look at some of the medical regimen treatments for type 2 diabetics or arthritis. Look at some of their side effects, which by the way can kill you, and you tell us whether it is worth taking that risk.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I want to say I did come off stronger than I wanted to and that there were some things that I said that were not mentioned in the post. However, I still stand by things that I said. </p>
<p>Most of the people that don't want to vaccine seem to be at least from my perspective, people who are overly paranoid about the government or some other conspiracy. </p>
<p>I know there are probably people who don't want it for other reasons, but this is how I was thinking at the time. Also, I don't know for sure why op doesn't want to vaccine I did assume a little there.</p>
<p>I'm just really tired of seeing people saying that masks don't work and vaccines don't work it's just really tiring when if people listened to actual health professionals instead of the Facebook accounts we would probably be in a better position.</p>
<p>Anyway, this has been fun, but I have things I need to do other than argue with someone on reddit.</p>

<p>Fine by me, I just wish you didn't assume too much.</p>
<p>&rt;Most of the people that don't want to vaccine seem to be at least from  my perspective, people who are <strong><em>overly paranoid about the government or  some other conspiracy</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Conspiracies cease being conspiracies when the media and government say one thing, but do another. For example, the news media had many people believe that vaccine passports were a "conspiracy theory." Many saw with the vaccines what was coming, Alex Jones, David Icke, Debbie Tavares, and the likes thereof, have been saying that this was coming for years. What was the media's response? That is it just one huge conspiracy theory. Funny how in my home State, New York, and also parts of California, they are rolling these out "passports" out. Look at Israel, and the U.K. Funny how these conspiracy theories end out being eventually true. </p>
<p>&rt;I know there are probably people who don't want it for other reasons.....</p>
<p>This, and the main reason? It is rushed! Ask yourself, would you fly in an 747 airplane that was built in under a month, barely tested and you can't sue the company that built it because the government says you can not? I have taken vaccines before, when I was younger. I would hope, the majority of us do not have issues with people taking vaccines, the issue is taking something that is rushed, unproven and we have little knowledge about to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>&rt;Anyway, this has been fun, but I have things I need to do other than argue with someone on reddit.</p>
<p>Throwing the towel already? No one is arguing, it is called discussion and debate like adults. I am presuming here, yeah I know, I shouldn't presume, but I presume you haven't had good experiences with debating folks on other sub-reddits. We do not have to agree on everything or agree at all, and with most folks on here, I am very sure you can disagree with them, and still chill out on a Saturday afternoon having a beer shooting the breeze.</p>

If we said anything on any of your subs, not only would we be downvoted but banned immediately since discussion of opposing views is bannable..

        <p>Opposing view points are important, but when there is a plethora of evidence and years of study supporting the other side of the argument, you have to switch sides or at least consider the fact that you might be wrong. I just don't understand people who are anti-vax it's not like this is a new technology or anything we've been vaccinating for over 200 years.</p>

        <p>Most of us don't oppose vaccines in general. MRNA vaccines are brand new, and untested. Go ahead and be the lab rat. If you are high risk for covid it may be a worthwhile tradeoff. But for many of us we'd rather take our chances with a virus which has a 99.9%+ survival rate.</p>

        <p>Mrna us new for humans, maybe you should be the one looking at the evidence instead of parenting media talking points that ignore science.  There is also no long term studies.   Now there is a new study about women whose menstrual cycles are all messed up aftrr getting vaccinated.  I am not anti Vax, just not naive like you for something that we have no idea how it affects human mid and long term.</p>

        <p>My grandkid's doc refuses to get vaccinated. Said if it costs him his hospital privileges, so be it. He refuses to take an untested vaccine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of smart healthcare folks out there. The MSM &amp; big tech actively keeps them from getting any media or social media attention.</p>

        <p>Nice. I wish I could talk to him.</p>
<p>It's easy to dismiss the "you must do it for others" argument...old/vulnerable people had first access to the vaccine for those that wanted it. That's what it's for--to protect the person who takes it.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to hear his response to this new hype about how young healthy people can easily become "long-haulers" and be unable to sweep the floor or taste food for nine months.</p>

        <p>I ended up taking the vaccine for personal reasons.  I'm the primary caretaker for my 88 y/o mother, primarily.  I'm also at a pretty high risk of getting very ill, and of course, bringing it home to Mom.  What gets me is that most of my close circle is against the vaccine and surprised and/or pissed off that I took it.  I'm a firm believer that if you don't want it, you shouldn't be forced to take it, but if someone chooses to take it, respect their decision as much as you do your own.  My doctor did tell me that if it weren't for my blood pressure issues he wouldn't push it on my or anyone else that is not a senior and healthy.</p>

        <p>There have always been incompetent doctors. Your doctor is saying his lonesome self is smarter knows better than the consensus of health care professionals around the world. I presume you are smart enough to know who is likelier to be wrong.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;He nodded and said that I don‚Äôt need the vaccine since I‚Äôm young, healthy and fit (I used to work at the gym as a PT before this corona hysteria and exercise regularly to distract myself from this clown world). I explained that a lot of people have been telling me that I should get vaccinated to keep old/vulnerable people safe and he said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We chatted for a bit and he said that I should continue doing what I do and had nothing to worry about. It was such a relief <em>not</em> to be gaslit by a health professional. For once I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being lied to.</p>
<p>Even a worldwide pandemic isn't enough to get rid of free riders. Luckily, herd immunity doesn't need everyone to be vaccinated. Though unfortunately the USA might have too many anti-vaxxers to reach that prized goal.</p>
