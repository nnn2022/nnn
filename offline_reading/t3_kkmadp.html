        <p>It's not our fault california locked down so hard to kill so many. Maybe you're mad at the wrong people?</p>
<p>Maybe you're mad at cuomo for forcing sick patients back in to nursing homes, the biggest source of deaths?</p>
<p>Maybe you're simply a bit confused all around.</p>

        <p>Ain't nothing compared to what Covid77 is going to do. </p>
<p>If fact, ain't nothing compared to deaths by smoking,  suicide,  overdose,  heart disease,  and about a dozen other things that aren't a pandemic.</p>

        <p>I agree. I was the reason those people died from cancer, heart attack, stroke, car accidents, lightning strikes, snake bites, falls, road rage, GBH,.... and got recorded as covid.</p>

        <p>Yeah no, how the fuck is this my fault? I always wear a fucking mask and social distance, even though I believe that it doesn't work for anything and it's just stupid. Tell me how the fuck this is somehow my fault, you fucking dolt. Does it really make sense that people are dying at normal rates compared to every other year and yet we're shaming people for seeing their own fucking families? Does it make sense that Sweden isn't up there and they never locked down amd yet we still have politicians shitting on small businesses and fat and miserable people shaming others for wanting to go outside their homes? Yeah, I'm going to call bullshit on this one and bullshit on you. Tell me, why, after taking the vaccine, will we still need to social distance and wear a fucking mask? Why?! The virus isn't deadly and a vaccine, one would think, should solve it completely. But no! They're still fucking jerking off at the idea of locking down the entire god forsaken country because it's never been about the fucking virus you fucking idiot. It's never been about protecting the people. It's never been about protecting you from dying. You know what? FUCK YOU people that comply with this bullshit. FUCK YOU for shaming me for trying to enjoy my youth. FUCK SCHOOLS for charging the exact same amount of money, even though remote learning SUCKS. "Ohhh but my grandma will dieeee!!!1!!1!!" Oh really? Look at all the small businesses ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED because of the pandemic. Look at all the people that have been empoverished. Dude, if this virus really was deadly, trust me, hospitals would be fucking packed right now and the whole world would be going fucking berzerk. BUT IT'S NOT. WE DECIDE WHEN WE WANT THIS TO BE OVER, BECAUSE COVID WON'T EVER GO AWAY. Jesus Christ man, I'll be turning 20 on January and the next year will be the same utter bullshit that people like you have put us through. Fucking leaving old people dying alone while allowing thousands of fatasses at walmart to buy their stupid fucking stuff? God damnit you guys are completely heartless. Also, I thought mental health was important. Now, apparently, no one gives a shit. You really just pulled out a screenshot from google and said this is our fault. Well, smartass, EXPLAIN WHY. I'M ONLY A NORMAL GUY THAT WANTS TO LIVE A FULFILLING LIFE AND WORKS AND STUDIES JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE. Fuck you.</p>
