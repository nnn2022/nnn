    <strong>Attention: Everyone in the USA</strong>
    <p><p>I'd advise you all to know Section 242, Title 18 of the US Code and The Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>The emergency powers these Governors and Public Officials have granted themselves are completely unconstitutional. Nowhere in the US Constitution does it allow them to do anything that infringes on our rights, and yes, even for a "global pandemic" (aka scamdemic). I looked, nothing about suspending my rights because of a pandemic. Your Constitutional rights are not government-given, so they can not be taken away by the government either. </p>
<p><strong>18 U.S. Code § 242 - Deprivation of rights under color of law:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States</strong>, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if bodily injury results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include the use, attempted use, or threatened use of a dangerous weapon, explosives, or fire, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section or if such acts include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill, shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Please get familiar with these, so when you have LEO's and Public officials try to force you to do anything that infringes upon your rights, you can cite the code and make it clear that they have no authority to deprive you of ANY of your GOD-GIVEN rights. I'm not saying you won't get arrested, but you need to know your rights so you can effectively defend yourself in court and have your case thrown out. </p>
<p>We need to make our stand and force them to out themselves as the fascists they are.</p></p>

        <p>There isn't a lack of people willing to fight back.</p>
<p>There's a lack of organization. By silencing any opposition it's incredibly hard to get enough people in the same place at the same time to do anything notable.</p>

        <p>It would help if you organized in your local communities first. Make it clear to your elected officials that you will not allow them to deprive you of your inalienable rights as a citizen, and if they do, file an official complaint with your state's attorney general. If it's a state organization, contact the DOJ. We need to start taking names and holding them accountable for their actions. If they refuse, keep the receipts, and when the time is right, they will be held responsible. We can't allow them an inch because we’ve seen what happens... They will take a mile. No More!</p>

        <p>OP, FYI and addition from the law books which informs AND instructs and tells the judge how he is supposed to interpret the law, which forces the courts that the courts must rule always in favor of the federal constitution since the federal constitution is the supreme law of the land:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>From: 16 American Jurisprudence 2d., Constitutional Law; Sec. 98 (1962)- ‘Effect of public emergency’:</strong> “<strong><em>While an emergency cannot create power, and no emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States Constitution or State Constitutions</em></strong>. Public emergency such as economic depression for especially liberal construction of constitutional powers, and it has been declared that because of national exigency, <strong><em>it is the policy of the courts of times of national peril, so liberally to construe the special powers vested in the chief executive as to sustain an effectuate the purpose there of, and to that end also more liberally to construe the constituted division and classification of the powers of the coordinate branches of the government, and in so far as may not be clearly inconsistent with the constitution to vest extraordinary powers in the chief executive</em></strong>. On the other hand, a contention that a grave emergency such as the Depression should permit construction of the constitutional provisions which would meet the emergency, was rejected in one case, the court holding that neither the legislature, nor any executive or judicial officer may disregard the provisions of the Constitution in cases of an emergency where the plain and unequivocal terms of the Constitution present to question of construction as to departures in emergencies.” (No emergency can grant powers that supersede the Constitution.)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>​From 16 American Jurisprudence 2d., Constitutional Law; Sec. 256 (1962)</strong>- 'Generally': "The general rule is that <strong><em>an unconstitutional statute, whether Federal or State, though having the form and name of law is in reality no law, but is wholly void and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from the time of the enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it</em></strong>. <strong><em>An unconstitutional law in legal contemplation is as inoperative as if it never had been passed.</em></strong> Such a statute leaves a question that it purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not ever been enacted. <strong><em>No repeal of an enactment is necessary, since an unconstitutional law is void.</em></strong> The general principles follows that it imposes no duties, confers no rights, creates no office, bestows no power of authority on anyone, affords no protection and justifies no acts performed under it. A contract which rests on a unconstitutional statute creates no obligation to be impaired by subsequent legislation. <strong><em>No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law. No courts are bound to enforce it.</em></strong> Persons convicted and fined under a statute subsequently held unconstitutional may recover the fines paid. A void act cannot be legally inconsistent with a valid one and an unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede an existing valid law. Indeed, in so far as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land, it is superseded thereby. Since an unconstitutional statute cannot repeal, or in any way affect an existing one, if a repealing statute is unconstitutional, the statute which it attempts to repeal remains in full force and effect. And where a statute in which it attempts to repeal remains in full force and effect and where a clause repealing a prior law is inserted in the act, which act is unconstitutional and void, the provision of the repeal of the prior law will usually fall with it and will not be permitted to operate as repealing such prior law. <strong><em>The general principle stated above apply to the constitutions as well as the laws of the several states insofar as they aren't repugnant to the Constitution and Laws of the United States</em></strong>. Moreover, a construction of a statute which brings it in conflict with a constitution will nullify it as effectively as if it had in its express terms, been enacted in conflict therewith." (<strong><em>The fundamental Law always stands superior</em></strong>), and Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803) and Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U.S. 425 (1886)</p>
