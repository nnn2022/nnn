    <strong>If this year has taught me anything -- it's that our modern society has an extreme fear of death and will do anything to avoid facing their own mortality. Even if it means living like scared shut-ins.</strong>
    <p><p>They pretend all these lockdowns are selfless and for the greater good, but in reality they're sending millions of people into eternal poverty and are completely fine with it as long as it means they don't have to face a 0.5% chance of mortality.</p>
<p>That's the epitome of selfish.</p>
<p>And no you lurking dweebs, it isn't normal to fear death this much. I'm sure it's always made people uneasy, but I've read enough books to know that for most of human history, people accepted that death was a part of life and nothing to fear.</p></p>

        <p>Completely accurate.</p>
<p>I always talk about death in a lackadaisical way. My family has always spoken openly about it &amp; I was never made to fear it. I was taught to avoid it as best as possible without ceasing actually living. You can see how being forced to try and avoid death to the detriment of all actual living is NOT ok for my family &amp; I &amp; we have pushed back hard.</p>
<p>My roommates think it’s very macabre how I speak about death but I’ve broken it down for them: death is the ONLY guarantee in life. It’s the only thing you can’t perpetually outrun so why try? Make reasonable efforts to live to let’s say 75 and anything after that is a bonus unless your quality of life sucks.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten so good at keeping people physically alive that we no longer think about quality. I’ve spoken to doctors and nurses who have had to beg families to let their non-DNR family members off life support because there’s no quality left for them. And the families won’t let go. The doctors can’t even get through to them that their loved ones will never again be conscious off a ventilator but these people are so unable to let go of the physical, they don’t realize the mental has already passed and the consciousness is gone. The waste of resources for cases like that is actually staggering. </p>
<p>We have way too many people who are obsessed with being upright and breathing that nothing beyond that matters to them when it should. Quality of life should matter far more than quantity.</p>

        <p>Exactly. My biggest gripe with this is how they are justifying these actions based on ICU capacity. Not only are ICUs designed to operate at or near capacity, but in prior years during flu season, there were plenty of hospitals that had their ICUs overwhelmed. Nobody gave a shit back then though and life went on as normal. </p>
<p>The media puts out a news story that ICUs are nearing capacity, something that regularly happens during flu season, and suddenly it's breaking news and we need to shut it all down. Manufactured fear indeed.</p>

        <p>They have immense power over the minds of the flock. They could literally pick anything and make the general public feel how ever they choose them to feel. For example, they could start reporting heavily on snake bites around the country. Full expose, pictures of the ded snakes, hospitalized patients with tubes and wires, wound photos, the works. Then repeat it daily for months. People would be freaking out thinking their going to die from a snake bite at any minute.</p>

        <p>I think in order to truly escape consumer culture, we need to accept the inevitability of death. Not just pay lip service, not just intellectually, not just poetically. We need to truly understand and accept that one day our individual consciousness will end and whatever we want to do with life needs to be done before that point, there is no back burner we can push it to. So much of our upbringing in the United States intentionally hides the cold reality of death, and forces us to see it as unnatural and scary, when it is completely natural, expected, and essential to life itself. </p>
<p>There is a certain beauty in impermanence, and we lose sight of that when we’re consumed by the daily grind. It probably isn’t until it’s too late that most of us actually realize, “holy shit I’m going to die, what the FUCK have I been spending my time doing?”</p>

        <p>There's a lot of good comments on this thread.   </p>
<p>If I might add just a bit of nuance..</p>
<p>It's not always fear of death.  There is also fear of loss which I think might be even larger.  My sister in law is simply scared silly of losing her immuno compromised husband.  To the point she almost wouldn't attend her daughter's wedding.  She's not selfish, but she is scared spitless.  (Unless you count fear of being alone and losing your partner of 50 years as selfish.  Which I suppose at some level it is)</p>
<p>I saw it in my wife's eyes just this morning.  I've developed a hacking productive cough.  The kind of thing I get pretty much every winter.  Not shaking this one though (and I'm not blaming masks, I don't wear one often enough to do that).  But snuggling in bed I got a couple good coughs going.  And the look in her eyes scared ME.  Now I know it's irrational. That makes it no less real. </p>
<p>tl;dr  Fear is very powerful.  But it's not just fear of death.  It is fear of loss, possibly for some fear of looking foolish. Fear none the less.</p>

        <p>FYI - there’s still a ton of Sahara dust in the air.  I’ve been hacking and coughing from post nasal drip since the second week of March.  Your cough isn’t likely covid, it’s probably all the particulate in the air this year.</p>

        <p>The more afraid someone is to die the more afraid they are to live. It's sad, really. I like riding motorcycles and I get a lot of comments about them being dangerous. Yep, so is living. In fact being alive is the number one cause of death. I think most doctors agree! I can try to minimize risk but I will never spend my short time here in fear.</p>
<p>Because others are unable to cope with something that's just as natural as birth, my freedoms are taken away. I am told what to wear, who I can have come to my house, what I can and can't do and soon what I need to inject in my body. That's incredibly selfish and I have the deepest hate for those sad, miserable people.</p>
<p>My time here is short and I plan to make the best of it. I've also had a couple of experiences that made me certain there's something beyond this life, without a doubt. I don't know what but there's more to the story that we don't know.</p>

        <p>It's natural to be scared of death, but if we want a normal life we need to make peace with the fact it happens. While <em>this</em> virus might be new, viruses in general are not. Every year lots of people die from the flu and still we don't wear masks or anything like that. We just accept that some people will die and we learn to live with it. That may sound uncaring, but I do care. All loss of life is sad but I don't see how we can get back to normal unless we acknowledge that just like other viruses, some people will probably die from covid each year.</p>

        <p>They think they are protected from death but in all the wrong ways. A lot of shut-ins that avoid cardio and decent diet are in for such an ugly ride later in life that makes covid look like the joke that it is. </p>
<p>I've seen family members go through strokes, heart attacks, diabetes, quadruple bypass, etc. And you don't even have to be the stereotypical obese giant, just a bit overweight combined with no exercise and before you even retire you can be relearning how to write from a stroke.</p>

        <p>I accepted my death the moment i blew my brains out with DMT. What an eye opener that stuff is! If light consumes all of darkness, light itself will cease to exist. Death and life is a dance of creation, unable to exist without one another. We all get recycled one day, but when you live in this materialistic delusion that is society, it's hard to find true inner peace.</p>

        <p>I mean where I come from, the government actually provides for the people that lost their jobs or companies so <em>literally</em> no one goes bankrupt or faces serious problems like becoming homeless. I don't quite get what you're saying because people aren't isolating and staying inside to save themselves, they are trying to protect the vulnerable like elderly people where the rate of death is a lot, a LOT higher than just 0,5 %.
... also there is no real downside to isolating at home, other than it being a bit inconvenient, but come on if it saves at least 1 life it's worth it after all. (I mean obviously if your country is incapable of providing proper support for those who face existential crisis cause they lost their jobs, that's a pretty big downside...)</p>

        <p>Since you said you want to hear different opinions I have a lot to say to this...</p>
<p>The problem is that no country can do this indefinitely. Eventually the money is gonna run out and they will start to go into huge debt that and future generations will have to pay massive taxes to pay it off (this is already happening in the UK). Paying half of the country  not to work and bailing out companies is not spare change...</p>
<p>And poor countries already cannot afford to do this. The country that I come from didn't even have unemployment payments when you lose your job before the lockdowns, let alone now. It's pretty much work or starve in some countries.</p>
<p>You saying the death rate in the elderly  is higher than 0,5% is a straw man argument, of course it is, elderly people are nearing the end of their life, covid is just one of the many causes of death for elderly people, it's simply not a strong enough argument for lockdowns.</p>
<p>"If it saves one life it's worth it" oof so much wrong with this, first of if this kind of thinking is applying to everything life would look much differently. Driving, smoking, alcohol, junk food would all be banned, we would go into lockdown every flu season and mandatory exercise would be a thing. Those thing would save A LOT of lives, much more than covid... If it only saves only life right? Why are covid deaths much more important than car crash, obesity, cancer etc deaths?</p>
<p>Second, it is very debatable that poverty and destruction lockdown causes is worth it if it saves even one life. Poverty shortens the average life span.</p>
<p>And lastly, like another redditor said already isolation is VERY damaging to people, there is a reason that's how prisoners are punished when they misbehave. I have read books about this and isolation literally causes people to lose their minds.</p>

        <p>...also because i got curious and looked it up. From what i gather from official reports from the season 2018/2019 1,373 people died from the flu and right now about 135 people die of covid, in austria, every day. Using simple maths we can see that, that would be about 49,000 in a year. I also read that the death rate for covid in the us is about 8,9 times to 41 times higher than compared to the flu. Source: https://www.anaesthesie.news/aktuelles/mortalitaetsvergleich-von-influenza-und-sars-cov-2-ist-die-grippe-fast-dasselbe-wie-covid-19/ 
Sadly it's in german but you can just translate if you want. That's why it's not "just like the flu".</p>

        <p>Sure, always appreciate different opinions. :)</p>
<p>I totally get what you're saying and i agree!
Obviously no country can do this forever but you're laying this out as if it would be years of lockdown i feel like, which it really isn't. Austria got the first wave under control with a lockdown that was about 1 month long. (They fucked it up afterwards by thinking that people would be responsible when that is never a good idea, but that's besides the point right now)</p>
<p>Sure, i get that and that's horrible, i agree with you.</p>
<p>So considering your argument about elderly people, i feel very strongly about this because my partner is a nurse and therefore a frontline worker, i wanna ask you: do you have an elderly person in your life you care about right now? Because i certainly do and saying that they "would die soon anyway due to other causes" is very VERY shortsighted and imo quite ignorant. In my eyes that's straight up neglect of human life. If my grandfather (73 years old) died of covid complications right now he could've easily lived for another 20 years. Are you willing to neglect entire generations, neglect elderly people you care about, just so that we as young people don't have to go through a lockdown that's what, 1 month, 2 months? That's pretty selfish i think.</p>
<p>Well the difference between fast food, smoking and so on and a pandemic is the fact that it's not about yourself, i don't get why so many people are so self centered when it's about this pandemic. It's about protecting the vulnerable and not yourself, because let's be real, if you're under 40 your chances of survival are <em>very</em> high. You can do to yourself what you want, drink yourself to death, eat yourself to death but as soon as ones stupidness and neglect could endanger other people, the government <em>has</em> to step in, because people simply aren't smart enough to do so. Also the flu argument is getting a tad annoying. As I said my girlfriend is a frontline worker and the stuff she tells me on a daily basis just hits differently... it is <em>not</em> the flu. It is <em>a lot</em> more dangerous. People on her station, young people mind you (even some younger than 40), literally slowly suffocating in their own fluids, their lungs being completely destroyed, it is not a nice death. The flu isn't comparable to covid and that's it. People trying to tell others what's really going on based on "news they heard" from so called "experts" have absolutely no right to tell anyone anything. Listen to the people that are fighting on the front lines.</p>
<p>Also again, it's not like you're being incarcerated for years, it's most likely 1 or 2 months, that's not a big deal. Even more so when you can actually go out and meet people with the proper precautions.</p>

        <p>I don't know what 2 months you are on about, it's been almost 1 year of this with no end in sight? </p>
<p>I'm in the UK and the majority of the country is practically in a lockdown, the only difference is you can go to the gym and shop for christmas crap. That's it.</p>
<p>Yes, I have two grandmothers, both of whom I flew to my home country in the summer to visit and I (gasp) hugged them. One of them is literally at the end of her life, she can't walk, see, or do much and has said she is done with life repeatedly even before covid. The one is more healthier than that but she still continued to see family members throughout the entire year. So it all comes down to individual choice for me. My grandmas choose to see me and hug me. I would never take that choice away from them, especially since considering they are old and I live in another country, every time I see them could be the last time, covid or no covid. And vice versa, I would never hug them if they didn't want me to.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be a personal choice. The govt or anyone else should not be making that choice for elderly people. Because there was a lot of elderly in the last year who have died from other causes, in isolation, without seeing their family for months, supposedly "for their own protection". This is in my opinion, cruel and moronic. Moronic because this kind of mandate pretends that no other causes of death exist. </p>
<p>I completely disagree with you about Austria. Virus didn't spread there, or anywhere else because people were irresponsible, it's because viruses will spread regardless. There are certain things humans cannot control and viruses are one of them. We're not gods.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about your gf, but are you now saying your argument for lockdowns is that we need to protect the people from death or that we need to protect people from a terrible death? Because those are two different things. So if covid caused a peaceful death in people you would be anti-lockdown? You're only in favor of the lockdown because covid causes a horrible death in some people?</p>

        <p>2 months of <em>hard</em> lockdown, no going out, only for work. That's what i was refferring to. I can obviously only speak for austria as I live here.</p>
<p>Well i can respect your grandmothers decision and i think it's very important to set those boundaries. Good on you.</p>
<p>Honestly, i think that's a very good argument you're making there, i totally agree that people should be able to make their own choices <em>however</em> it kinda is a governments job to protect it's people so what the main reason for the lockdown is, is to protect people from catching the virus. Not at least for the peoples sake but also to prevent hospitals from bursting and to be able to provide the proper attention to everybody. Because, let's say a 65 year old women goes out and catches covid, the government can't just let her die on her own miserably, they'll have to take care of her, which they wouldn't be able to if the hospitals are completely overloaded. The lockdown also is a sort of last resort measure to prevent exactly that from happening. But as i said, i agree. Old people dying alone in isolation is absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>About austria, i honestly can't remember the source but i think that it was the Robert Koch Institute, that said that the big majority of infections came from illegal housparties during lockdown so i would disagree and say that it actually comes from people being irresponsible quite a lot.</p>
<p>I honestly don't quite understand what makes you think that i would be anti-lockdown if it was a peaceful death, i don't want people to die from the virus regardless of the circumstances. Also i want to make very clear that i am not "pro-lockdown". Just like anybody else i don't enjoy it a bit, can't wait for everything to end and go back to normal, especially since my job is tied to it as well. I'm a flight attendant and started my flight school before covid so i have debt as high as about 80.000 € right now and i barely get to work anything right now, so believe me when i say that i, just like everybody else, want this to end as soon as possible. I just think that the lockdown is a necessary measure, even though not a perfect measure in any way, to make sure hospitals don't burst and everybody can get the proper care they need <em>in case</em> something goes wrong for them, that's all.</p>
<p>Also i just wanted to say thank you for being open and talking to me, i really appreciate it. As i said i am not out to fight anybody, i just enjoy civil discussion, and hearing people's opinion that differ from my own, which is very hard to find i feel like so: thank you!</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but you clearly don't have a clue. Especially since more likely than not the global air traffic will be massively reduced even after all this. There's a good chance you wont find a job or lose it. With all the debt that countries have made and with a huge economic recession building up over the last decade we can expect a crash within the next few years. Far fewer people will fly after that because many wont be able to afford it anymore.</p>
<p>The aviation industry has massive lay-offs and since there's no end in sight of this malicious government you can expect more of those to come.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are useless and a horrible choice. At this point it is clear that the amount of people that die because of the lockdowns and immediate effects thereof will be in the tens of millions across the world. 10s of million in poor countries will starve and by locking the population down for so long we will soon see that the average person is becoming much unhealthier be it because of lack of social contact which leads to depression and suicide, or the lack of excercise, unhealthy diet since you can't go to restaurants and many people can't cook or even the masks which are harmful in long term use.</p>
<p>Get rid of the idea that any of these measures are justified. Masks have been shown to be useless, and lockdowns have had no benefit since they cause huge social and economic destruction while only prolonging the time until herd immunity is reached. Nursing homes are still getting hit hard despite all the measures in place. And forget about the vaccines. In one year not even the greatest genius can create a safe and effective vaccine. It has never been done and it will never happen. What we have right here is essentially a vaccine that is in it's basic trials.</p>
<p>&rt;Because, let's say a 65 year old women goes out and catches covid, the  government can't just let her die on her own miserably, they'll have to  take care of her, which they wouldn't be able to if the hospitals are  completely overloaded.</p>
<p>Hospitals have not been overloaded unless the countries made huge mistakes such as Italy putting covid patients in nursing homes. In fact if you research you'd find that many hospitals are financially struggling since they don't have enough patients. In Germany we never had overloaded hospitals except in big cities where this happens everey flu season. In fact hundreds of thousands in medical care were sent home and not working fulltime. Besides the ICU capacity was decreased by several thousand beds despite the media claiming that hospitals might become overloaded. Clearly not, considering all I've written so far.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;2018/2019 1,373 people died from the flu and right now about 135 people die of covid, in austria, every day.  Using simple maths we can see that, that would be about 49,000 in a  year. I also read that the death rate for covid in the us is about 8,9  times to 41 times higher than compared to the flu</p>
<p>You should realize yourself that the simple maths you proposed are too simple. During summer far less people die of respiratory illnesses than during winter. And in regards of the flu death numbers you might want to look at how those are counted. For Corona anyone who had a positive test within 28 days of their death is counted as Corona death, this is not the case for the flu. As we can see in many countries the overall death rate remains the same. This means many Corona deaths are nothing more than mislabeled deaths from many other diseases etc. since those have miraculously gone down.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;2 months of <em>hard</em> lockdown, no going out, only for work.</p>
<p>You know what that does? It ruins many many businesses once and for all. And you cannot control a virus, even after two months there would be people that have it and spread it at work.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I mean where I come from, the government actually provides for the people that lost their jobs or companies so <em>literally</em> no one goes bankrupt or faces serious problems like becoming homeless.</p>
<p>Many companies will <em>literally</em> go bankrupt because value cannot be created from nothing and the money printer will only run so long. And <em>literally</em> millions will face homelessness as soon as that stops and as soon as those businesses say bye for good.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So considering your argument about elderly people, i feel very strongly  about this because my partner is a nurse and therefore a frontline  worker, i wanna ask you: do you have an elderly person in your life you  care about right now? Because i certainly do and saying that they "would  die soon anyway due to other causes" is very VERY shortsighted and imo  quite ignorant. In my eyes that's straight up neglect of human life.</p>
<p>No it's ignorant to force children to wear masks despite the known dangers for them.</p>
<p>What is being done to children is inhumane. Making them wear masks despite them not being at risk and asymptomatic transmission being shown as basically nonexistant. Children can take actual long term damage from masks. Also by not letting them see other peoples faces and facial expressions we're basically seing a generation of psychologically traumatised children being created. These children have to live on this planet for dozens of years unlike those who are at risk of Covid who mostly would die within months anyway. That is if the children don't commit suicide which more and more of them are doing. Depression and suicidal thoughts are soaring.</p>
<p>It's ignorant but more so inhuman to not let the people that are at the end of their life see their family and isolate them against their will, it's ignorant to ruin businesses because of a virus that is less deadly than the flu (see CDC stats). And maybe you missed it but during the last few months we had the largest wealth transfer from poor to rich ever. Your moral argument is nothing short of mockery because it is so ignorant of all the horrible sideffects that lockdowns have on people that are not at the end of their lifespan.</p>
<p>The average death age of Covid labeled deaths is higher than the average death age in most countries. These people have clearly had a long life and it is ridiculous to claim that them being protected (but not really as the ineficacy of measures shows when it comes to nursing homes etc.) is more important than the wellbeing and than building a solid future for the current and future generations.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If  my grandfather (73 years old) died of covid complications right now he  could've easily lived for another 20 years.</p>
<p>How would you know?</p>
<p>Apart from that in the future healthcare will be much worse due to the lack of money which was wasted for a virus no more dangerous than the flu. No anecdotal story of some random young but most likely unhealthy person will change the facts and it might be noteworthy that the flu is far more dangerous for young people than Covid despite still not very dangerous in the first place.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Are you willing to neglect  entire generations, neglect elderly people you care about, just so that  we as young people don't have to go through a lockdown that's what, 1  month, 2 months? That's pretty selfish i think.</p>
<p>We have gone through lockdowns lasting more than a month and through many other pointless measures. It's straight up moronic to talk about selfishness at this point. In fact it is the other way around. People who don't suffer as much from lockdowns are acting selfishly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;People on her station, young people mind you (even some younger than  40), literally slowly suffocating in their own fluids, their lungs being  completely destroyed, it is not a nice death.</p>
<p>You think starving is? The amount of people that will die of starvation surpasses Covid (despite many of those Covid deaths being mislabeled) by tenfolds.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In short: From both a moral and logical perspective what goverments are currently doing is the most malicious crime on the largest scale possible in the history of humanity.</p>

<p>You say a lot of stuff, but don't provide any sources. Unlike the person I've talked to here before you don't seem to be reasoned with at all. A lot of stuff you're saying is straight up wrong and dangerous I'm sorry but that's the way it is. </p>
<p>The one thing I'm gonna say is about hospitals... you're trying to tell me, someone who's been living with a frontline worker for years now, that hospitals aren't "full enough" and "looking for patients"? My girlfriend has been doing 55 hour weeks  since a year now because her hospital is literally bursting. I'm not looking for further discussion, because i don't think this will lead to anything based on your assumptions. What i would like is you to provide sources to <em>ALL</em> of the things you said.

I'm a university student who has spent enough time learning how to find trustworthy sources and who knows how to interpret data much better than about 99.9% of the population.

        <p>&rt; Hi, I won't bother replying to everything you said because I simply don't have the time right now, sorry! </p>
<p>Fair enough. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; You say a lot of stuff, but don't provide any sources.  </p>
<p>The sources can be found by searching through r/LockdownSkepticism, r/NoNewNormal and by regular internet search. I have read a lot since May and I don't have a compiled list of everything. You could try to put in some effort yourself, after all it concerns you just as much as me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Unlike the person  I've talked to here before you don't seem to be reasoned with at all.</p>
<p>Great that you can deduce something like that without having tried in the first place. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The one thing I'm gonna say is about hospitals... you're trying to tell  me, someone who's been living with a frontline worker for years now,  that hospitals aren't "full enough" and "looking for patients"? </p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Of course there some exceptions but in general the absolute majority of hospitals has never even been close to being overloaded. It's also a fact that ICU capacity has been reduced by several thousand over the last months in Germany. Because there was absolutely no need for them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I'm not looking for further discussion, because i don't think this will lead to anything based on your assumptions. </p>
<p>You never looked for discussion then. Most of what I've written doesn't need sources since it can be observed irl and none of what I said are assumptions. You chose to ignore all of that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; A lot of stuff you're saying is straight up wrong and dangerous I'm sorry but that's the way it is. </p>
<p>It's dangerous to run around as uninformed as you. Arguing the other way around where are the sources that prove <em>a lot of the stuff</em> I say is wrong? When most of what I said doesn't require sources to be confirmed as true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; What i would like is you to provide sources to <em>ALL</em> of the things you said. Reliable sources. Not websites no one has ever heard of. </p>
<p>Right, let me just go through months of research again just so I can post links for someone who after 9 months is still extraordinarily uninformed.</p>

        <p>I obviously don't know how it is, where you are. Here in austria you can still go out and meet others, as long as you're outside, and take all the necessary precautions like distancing from each other. Also there's still something like Skype so please don't pretend that it's like you're locked up like a prisoner... (also you're acting like you'd be "locked up" for years rather than about a month which it usually is)
Well, are you willing to kill someone as well? Because that's realistically what you're more likely to do.</p>

        <p>i have no words for this bullshit. are you not interested in saving lives? are you saying that if i get covid it’s my fault and it’s just survival of the fittest? what if it was your family member or best friend? you’re being insensitive and it saddens me to see this. and masks are the LEAST you can do to help. and yes, people can die from other things but this is a literal pandemic. this is a virus with no god damn cure. this is different from car accidents or overdoses. those can be prevented and as of right now, this virus basically cannot unless we as people help slow the spread until it can be. the only reason you all won’t wear masks is because you don’t want to be told how to live your lives and you probably have some kind of trauma that makes you think that way. truly sad.</p>

        <p>It's cute when they try to think. You can tell it's trying really, REALLY hard to make a salient point but all it can do is regurgitate talking points. So adorable.</p>

        <p>The world doesn't revolve around you. People with compromised immune systems are vulnerable to alot of things as you should know. Your condition is also nothing new. We've never gone to these extremes before despite people with compromised immune systems being nothing new. Your health is your responsibility. Knowing your condition you should certainly take the necessary measures to protect yourself. However others need to get on with their lives. We as a society assume risks to improve efficiency. Imagine how many lives we could save each year if everyone drove 30mph? However we drive 75mph on the freeway despite the higher speeds making accidents more fatal for improved efficiency. I don't think you would want to live with 30mph maximum speed limit everywhere anymore than we want to live with lockdowns and restrictions on our personal freedoms. So does you not wanting to drive 30mph everywhere make you insensitive to those who've lost loved ones in traffic fatalities? I would think not but that would be an example of the senseless guilt trip you're trying to pull here.</p>

        <p>My uncle died of COVID last October.  He lived in a nursing home.  He was locked in his room for months like a prisoner.  </p>
<p>The staff at the nursing home could not have done any more to keep it out of there than they did, beyond locking all the staff in the home last March.  You need to fucking CHILL.</p>
<p>My dad died a week and a half before my uncle.  FROM SMOKING.  No one - especially freak shows like you -  give a shit about his death because it wasn't the high and mighty COVID.  I'll bet cash money you don't run around like an asylum escapee knocking cigarettes out of people's hands, and yet second hand smoke KILLS.  Cigarette filters are the worst plastic polluter in the world.  If you're so fucking afraid go hide in a basement somewhere and starve to death.  FFS.</p>

        <p>i’m sorry you lost them both, that must be really shitty. my mother also smokes so i get it. and no, i don’t do that because i would get beat up or yelled at for knocking it out of their hand. i don’t understand why you feel the need to say such hateful things to me. i’m no freak show, i’m perfectly normal. the fact that people are upvoting your comment and supporting what you are saying to me is saddening. you don’t have to like me or agree with me but you can debate without being hateful.</p>

        <p>Many of us have had covid and know that it is a glorified cold. Wearing a mask does nothing and the science is crystal clear, you would know if you could actually read research papers instead of gobbling down whatever fear mongering garbage the mainstream media feeds you. You haven’t the slightest idea what we on this sub know and you are too close minded to even take a look at the overwhelming evidence that supports our positions.</p>

<p>Also, it's been around for over a year now. Clearly you're still alive whining despite the virus being so deadly and contagious.</p>
