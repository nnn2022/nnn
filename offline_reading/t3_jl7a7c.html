    <strong>So many masks yet COVID still spreading like wildfire.</strong>
    <p><p>I noticed today that in my state of North Dakota, covid cases are increasing pretty quickly. </p>
<p>Yet, whenever I go ANYWHERE, people are wearing masks. I rarely see anybody not wearing a mask unless they’re outside or at home. </p>
<p>Why are cases flaring up so much if masks work? There is no way that this huge increase in cases is caused by the few people not wearing masks...</p></p>

        <p>Yep I had a mask-adamant person at work come to work with a cold, and pull her mask down to cough and sneeze. I said if masks work then how’d you get sick? And she said “I no longer feel comfortable, I’m going home.”</p>

        <p>My boyfriend caught a cold lately, but vehemently denied he was sick at all. Adament about masks and six feet, but could not accept he caught an illness he's gotten over a dozen times in his life. I don't get it either.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry about that, I didn't mean to be insensitive.  I broke up with my girlfriend a few months back, similar issues, but we'd only been together a year.  Completely destroyed my view of her and I knew I'd never be able to respect her even if there is a return to normal at some point.  It was kind of mutual anyway since she felt my refusal to comply with the measures etc. made her 'anxious and scared' so yea, there was no hope left there.</p>

        <p>This is how deluded people are now. They have descended into a full blown psychosis therefore their reality encompasses their belief in the pandemic, masks, isolation and anything to the contrary could literally shatter this reality and subsequent psyche altogether, so as a defense mechanism their minds will reject everything and anything that could suggest otherwise. Scary but this is where we are.</p>

        <p>because they ramped up the 'cycles' used on the rt pcr manufacturing technique that is being misused as a 'diagnostic test' to deliberately increase the number of 'positives', which are then mislabeled as 'cases', despite &rt;80-90% having no symptoms.</p>
<p>this 'test' they use literally manufactures by replication 'fragments' of god knows what, they never actually say, lol</p>

        <p>I'm familiar with the PCR test and the process and what they look for, it is not designed to diagnose/detect viruses but I'm curious on what you've mentioned about cycles being ramped up. I know some places use anywhere between 40-50 cycles but didn't realize that the cycles got amped up... the higher the more false positives. Do you have any source on that?</p>

        <p>anything more than 20ish cycles is tenuous. germany won't count any pcr that uses more than 25. </p>
<p>40-50 cycles yields up to a 90% (false) positive rate, per the commie NYT (i'm lazy to search it, it's out there though)</p>
<p>using rt pcr as a diagnostic is outright and blatant fraud.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply! With having mentioned Germany, I looked it up and they have 70k cases for the week so far (unless I wasn't looking at it correctly), when you mentioned they won't count any PCR that uses more than 25 cycles, are those mostly false positive or do they really have genuinely 70k legit cases? I wish Karry Mullis was still around, he would have probably spoken out about this and have been vocal, it's unfortunate of how they are using his test now :(</p>

        <p>a 'positive test' result absent any symptoms is not a medical 'case', like wise a person with symptoms, regardless of a any test at all, is a medical case</p>
<p>as for germany's 70k 'cases', see above. no symptoms = no case. what they have is 70k 'positive results' of people that have some fragments (nucleotides) of the common cold causing corona, maybe, at best.</p>
<p>kary mullis was well aware of his technique (not test) being misused as a diagnostic. videos of him explaining his objections to the pcr misuse/abuse do exist (again i am too lazy to search). he was quite outspoken about it and would tell anyone who was willing to listen for years.</p>

        <p>Found a couple articles describing the process and the relationship to cycles.</p>
<p>The science itself appears a little suspect but then factor in the cycles premise and it sounds like you could make anything "appear" in the results. To me it seems apparent that due to the nature of this test and the amplification process, if someone ever had a virus from the coronavirus family it could very well be identified as COVID. </p>

        <p>yes, a huge part of this scam is calling RT PCR a 'test'</p>
<p>it is not a test at all. i dont think is was ever 'vetted' as a diagnostic test, like every other test is.</p>

        <p>Viral presence is easily detectable at 10 cycles. 30 cycles is mamaximum amplification for any reasonable accuracy of the test results. 40-50 cycles is an intentional attempt to manufacture massive amounts of false positive results, as is currently being done by every testing lab. This is an indisputably coordinated act of unprecedented data fraud on global scale.</p>

        <p>I'm in MA and we have been having a 1,000+ cases for like the past week for the first time since May (not nearly as many deaths but it's all about cases, remember).  Yet 95% of people are wearing masks, literally everywhere.   Indoors, outdoors, in their car by themself.  It snowed today and I saw people shoveling by themselves wearing masks.   Yet the city of Boston is ready to shut down indoor dining for whatever reason.</p>

        <p>But now the story is that it is private gatherings with friends at home that is causing spread.</p>
<p>Crimes are being committed at home (which you cant see) .. to create "cases" (which you cant notice with your eyes if they are asymptomatic, and cant see if they are symptomatic because they are all staying home, and cant see in the hospitals because no cameras) .. that eventually end up killing someone (or possibly just "contributing" to their death), down the line, over the horizon, which you also wont see .. until the whole situation gets told to you in an online article so you can know how terrible things are around you!</p>

        <p>It absolutely infuriates me whenever I read about politicians wanting to shut down indoor gatherings with friends.  The times I've gotten together with my friends at their houses have been some of the best times of my year.  The sheer happiness I felt to see them cannot be understated.  It's those experiences that make people happy in life in general.  Anyone who wants to legislate that away should never be in power ever again.</p>

        <p>Here’s the issue though: Masks are being touted as the be all, end all, and they’re being “legally” mandated on that basis.</p>
<p>If people believe that masks are effective, I encourage them to wear them.</p>
<p>What I have a problem with are the attitudes that absolutely everyone should wear masks at all times, and that anyone not wearing a mask is somehow wrong/evil.</p>
<p>If you think masks are important, that’s your prerogative; just don’t go trying to force others to do things that make them uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>Your response has nothing to do with me.
Three people made a stupid decision to ride in a car together when one of them has a virus, all presumably thinking that the mask would be enough protection.  Whether masks are mandated or not makes no difference.</p>

        <p>I was on the bus the other day and this women told me to put my mask over my nose because she “hates having to breath other peoples air”. Told her to buy a car. How fucking entitled can you be on PUBLIC transit? People have been breathing each other’s air on buses and subways for decades now and it’s always packed. You spent $2 to ride and are trying to tell people what to do to make you comfortable lol.</p>

        <p>Unless you are wearing a full face respirator and hazmat suit, masks are pointless.</p>
<p>That being said, there is much more to the COVID pandemic than a virus, which if it was would be defying all the known rules of viral propagation. They need these constant spikes in cases to perpetuate the fear until they have a large enough consensus to roll out a mandated vaccine that I can only speculate what it's true purpose is, but I know it has nothing to do with preventing or stopping any claimed COVID virus.</p>
