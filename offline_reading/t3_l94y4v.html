    <strong>I guess it’s Brazil’s turn for a new variant.</strong>

<p>Note how many times the word “scary” was used in the article. Also note the last sentence. “Of course there will almost certainly be more variants coming over those next three years as well”. Sigh.</p></p>

        <p>That is not due to CoVid-19, that is due to lockdowns and poor planning by elected officials.</p>
<p>CoVid-19 is LESS lethal than numerous colds and flus from 2000-2018 AND needs LESS people put on oxygen support than those colds and flus from 2000-2018.</p>
<p>The whole "We are running out of oxygen!" is coming from some actually mandatory businesses that supplied oxygen being labeled 'non-mandatory'.</p>

        <p>On the 15th the amazonian hospitals asked for help, on the 16th the governor decided that wouldn't be necessary since he's an ally of the current Brazilian "government"</p>
<p>O2 wasn't found it was sent by Venezuela after the hospitals collapsed, you can check the judicial order mandating the state transfer any new patients <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/noticias.uol.com.br/saude/ultimas-noticias/redacao/2021/01/14/am-vai-transferir-pacientes-a-outros-estados-e-decretar-toque-de-recolher.amp.htm">here</a> if you don't believe me</p>

<p>It's yet another example of the media saying "Something is <em>about</em> to happen!" .. and then it doesn't happen.  But people still remember what they read, and assume that it <em>has</em> happened.</p>
<p>And by the way, isn't Manaus where all of the hospitals were going to collapse when Brazil got hit in the Summertime and everybody said it was going to be an apocalypse and there would be bodies in the streets across the country?</p>

<p>Correct, they requested the transfers on the 14/15 (depending on time zone)</p>
<p>&rt;You can already find articles from the following day saying this didn't happen.</p>
<p>It didn't happen because of political interests, we got saved by Venezuela and even that isn't enough, hence the order to transfer new patients </p>

<p>Well, not sure you know how o² works, but when we need it it's kinda of an emergency?</p>
<p>That's  why around the <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/valor.globo.com/google/amp/politica/noticia/2021/01/18/governo-sabia-desde-o-dia-8-sobre-escassez-de-oxigenio-em-manaus.ghtml">8th the federal government</a> already new about the 0² shortage, due to their inaction because they behave like most of this sub on the 15 you can see the <a href="https://youtu.be/Hu3tcJICUGg">live reaction from the governor of São Paulo reacting</a> to their emergency request to transport the babies</p>
<p>&rt;And by the way, isn't Manaus where all of the hospitals were going to collapse when Brazil got hit in the Summertime and everybody said it was going to be an apocalypse and there would be bodies in the streets across the country?</p>
<p>Not sure which month you mean by Summertime, but we didn't have bodies on the street, since they <a href="https://g1.globo.com/jornal-nacional/noticia/2020/12/31/amazonas-instala-camaras-frigorificas-em-hospitais-publicos-para-corpos-de-vitimas-da-covid.ghtml">had refrigerators to move the bodies after the morgue was full</a> edit.

        <p>&rt; It didn't happen because of political interests,</p>
<p>So why did you say it did happen?</p>
<p>&rt;YOU - We had to move over 60 babies from hospitals in this state because this nem strain finished up our oxygen stocks</p>
<p>And as for the refrigerators .. </p>
<p>We had them too .. back in 2017/2018.</p>

<p>&rt;The Stark County coroner in Canton had a “cold storage mass casualty trailer” trucked-in on Saturday because the morgue was overflowing with bodies, nearly half of them victims of drug overdoses.</p>
<p>It's really not that unique.  you can find lots of stories from the past years of "tents outside hospitals" as well.</p>
<p>People just didn't pay attention to those stories, so now when you say the same thing it sounds like a "once in a lifetime event".</p>
<p>&rt;The reason for this morbid confusion is that the United States is enduring a cadaver pileup. <strong>Medical examiners around the country are being overrun with bodies that no one comes to pick up, a trend that many coroners attribute to the nation’s opioid epidemic.</strong> Drug-overdose deaths increased by 10 percent from 2016 to 2017, largely driven by fentanyls and similar drugs, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/unclaimed-bodies-problem/582625/">source</a></p>

<p>So you're just choosing to ignore that the new strain + no lockdown threw us ina desperate situation?</p>
<p>&rt;It seems like that was the prediction, but it didn't happen.</p>
<p>Chegam means they will arrive after being flown, so they wrote this piece before landing that's all </p>
<p>And again this doesn't remove the fact that we got to this situation</p>
<p>&rt;Well .. my city has a population of 500,000 people. But there are only 15 covid patients in the 2 hospitals.</p>
<p>And my city has 14 million people with over 49 thousand dead and hospitals at 70% of capacity</p>

<p>Hospitalizations are the metric the government in brazil uses to control the situation, which means it takes around 2/3 weeks to know how bad things actually are</p>
<p>&rt;But 15 covid hospitalizations in the middle of virus season, in the middle of the "Deadliest Pandemic of the Century" doesnt seem like such a bad-looking pig.</p>
<p>Imagine trying to make your specific situation, which I'll be honest I very much doubt you're saying the truth specially with the lack of sources, as it was a reflection of the whole situation</p>
