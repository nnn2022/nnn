    <strong>I'm starting to think that the television and social media are making it seem like there are way more lockdown supporters than their actually are.</strong>
    <p><p>Always remember that these social media sites are filled with bots who exist to influence public opinion. </p>
<p>Most people I know IRL aren't in love with this shit. Most go along with it because of social pressure and conditioning, but most aren't fans of it and I can tell that if the right person were to rise up, they may follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>I truly believe that it's a small but vocal minority of mentally ill shut-ins who want this to continue.</p></p>

        <p>I’m a college student who works part time at a grocery store and I notice this. I have had a lot of conversations with customers about the whole situation. Once they realize by the way I describe Cuomo and the lockdowns that I’m not one of those doomer types, they finally let loose and rant on about how much they hate everything that’s going on.</p>

        <p>That is the problem with rising up - somebody has to go first, and nobody wants to be a martyr.</p>
<p>Edit: Incidentally, this is why all movements look bad at first - those that join them early on are those with nothing to lose or those with poor impulse control, which correlates with things like mental illnesses, violent personalities etc </p>
<p>It's when the regular Joe looks around and thinks "that one psycho from 10 years was a psycho...but not wrong!" that things really accelerate. Nothing is quite so destructive as a law-abiding citizen of peace going on the warpath. There's been numerous movies made around the concept.</p>

        <p>I hate to say it but it’s very much a class thing. Posh mates from the countryside are happy to work from mommy’s mansion and just post memes calling me a conspiracy theorist when I try to point out that lockdown is bad.</p>
<p>They are privileged assholes who before this year wouldn’t shut up about food banks and mental health but surprisingly they don’t mention that anymore.</p>
<p>My working class mates agree with me but are too busy/afraid to risk speaking out.</p>
<p>Honestly I hate to make it about class but that’s my observation.</p>

        <p>I think you’re both right.</p>
<p>We have two classes, those who via employment and income are able to afford to cloister themselves at home (the cloistered class), and those who don’t have that luxury (the rest of us).</p>
<p>There’s absolutely a psy-op in progress on social media, and it’s aimed at the cloistered class. Politicians are part of this class, and have been major targets. The members of the cloistered class have bought into the psy-op, and thoughtlessly parrot it as if everyone believes those things.</p>
<p>The rest of us are still living in the real world, so we see the reality that the cloistered class misses.</p>
<p>So it’s both.</p>

        <p>I think there's an additional category, maybe small, of people who might be financially okay in a lockdown but can't/won't comply because of mental health reasons, valuing freedom, etc. I'd put myself in this camp and I'm not sure how common this is. I can work from home just fine and not worry about my income, but "just stay at home" absolutely would wreck my mental state if I followed social distancing perfectly like most of my coworkers seem to do. You could say I'm privileged in an income way but definitely NOT privileged when it comes to my mental health state, living alone without a spouse to keep me company like the most extreme pro-lockdowners tend to have, etc.</p>

        <p>I've been wondering about that. No social gatherings and interaction only through a screen is destructive on multiple levels. How can relationships be formed and developed without meeting in person? There's so much that a screen doesn't convey about someone.</p>

        <p>I'm in this category, and I <em>do</em> have a spouse. </p>
<p>We're a social species. Even the introverts like me need <em>some</em> of the things we do -- and for them to be comforting and normal, not distanced and masked -- or we will eventually go insane.</p>

        <p>Similar. I am working from home, but all of this is just wrong, and it makes me sick. I have actually benefitted in some ways from the lock downs, but I just find it all disgusting, and I understand that others are being deeply hurt. I also see that the trouble will come for the work from home people soon enough.</p>

        <p>I got into trouble with my employer the other day over speaking up. I’m an HVAC engineer and often have to do site inspections prior to doing the engineering design.  I arrived at an office building to do my survey and was literally yelled at by their security people from the instant I arrived. Don’t use the front door, walk around to the loading dock. You must have your temperature taken. Sir, SIR! Use the hand sanitizer! Don’t stand there while waiting for the elevator, stand <em>there.</em> They we’re acting like prison guards and were obviously enjoying their new authority.  </p>
<p>On my way out of the building they started up again. I told the lady that she was power-tripping, that this had nothing to do with a virus and that she simply enjoyed hassling people. Then I walked right out the front door that she told me not to use.  </p>
<p>But by the time I had gotten back to the office, I’d learned that she had made some phone calls. Her boss called her boss, who called our client, who called my boss, who wasn’t happy.  Evidently I’ve been “banned” from the building!   My point to all of this is that there are a great many working-class people out there who are enjoying the newfound authority that comes with this fake pandemic.</p>

        <p>In my experience it's the opposite. Young working class are all rabidly pro-lockdown. I think wearing masks 8hrs a day have demoralized them. They are blaming problems on mythical "anti-maskers" and "super-spreaders" but fail to realize government edicts are to blame. Ultimately the MSM is highly effective at brainwashing people.</p>

<p>That's the most fucked up part of this. I can't even talk about this shit reasonably with people. I dare not bring it up around anyone who is slightly left leaning. The only thing I can talk about with people that is neutral is sports or nerdy tech shit. There's no moderate it's either far left or far right which makes the population hate each other.</p>

        <p>No, I think it’s the survival instinct.</p>
<p>People recognize the dangers of large groups—if the group turns on you, they can kill you and there’s nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>As a result, we have an instinctive survival reflex where we try to read the crowd, and then virtue signal behavior we think that the crowd will like. The reason why mobs of people are so dangerous is that we suck at reading crowds, which causes us to take much more extreme steps than we otherwise would, which tends to cause a self-reinforcing feedback loop as everyone just tries to virtue signal harder.</p>
<p>That’s how this all got started: A foreign government, or governments, launched an influence campaign on social media, using fake accounts and/or bots. People then bought into that campaign, and what we’ve seen over the last 8+ months is the product of the resulting feedback loop of virtue signaling.</p>
<p>Cracks started to appear relatively early on, around the beginning of April. That’s when we started to see massive anti-lockdown protests.</p>
<p>That’s also when they started pushing mask mandates on us. Those mask mandates were a psy-op to convince us that we were surrounded by people who fully bought into the need to panic.</p>
<p>That effort worked so well that it’s taken almost 6 months to get past it. Even so, what’s doing it now isn’t that people aren’t terrified of going against their neighbors. What’s doing it is that they’re finally more scared of what continued lockdowns will mean for them—hunger, poverty, homelessness, and death.</p>
<p>For the last 6 months, people have been afraid to stand up because they thought it could lead to them losing everything that they had—their jobs, their friends, their families, their homes, etc.</p>
<p>People are finally waking up and realizing that they’ve had things completely backwards: Tjey can either fight this now while they may still be able to preserve most of what they have, or they’ll lose absolutely everything.</p>

<p>Just today, I had a discussion on Facebook with a physician i know personally.</p>
<p>It seems like she can barely wait to get herself and her patients vaccinated. </p>
<p>Nevermind that there's never been any m-RNA vaccine that's been approved for mass production.</p>
<p>Nevermand that fast-tracking a vaccine is irresponsible, especially for a virus that's barely killing anyone.</p>
<p>Nevermind that forcing people to take an experimental vaccine on a massive scale is a crime against humanity, which can potentially ruin the lives of millions.</p>
<p>It boggles my mind how anyone with a degree in medicine can't see through all this nonsense and keeps defending the official narrative when it's so utterly nonsensical and debunked over and over...</p>

        <p>A lot of people are just so much more reasonable when you actually talk to them. I’ve had some great conversations with coworkers who are a bit more receptive to some of the restrictions in place. The idiots online who think we should be locking down forever because “we’re in a pandemic” are uninformed virtue signalers trying to get karma, likes, followers, etc.</p>

There are so many ridiculously unnecessary jobs out there that get payed to do even harmful nonsense, that the thought of the ruling class paying shills to spread propaganda is absolutely realistic, and likely a very crucial ingredient in this whole scamdemic.</p>

        <p>Not just shut-ins... people who only watch and believe the mainstream media as well.</p>
<p>I know someone who is pro-lockdown, pro-BLM and Antifa and anti-Trump and she doesn't wanna acknowledge other viewpoints at all.</p>
<p>She doesn't wanna believe that there exists any kind of evidence that some voter fraud might have occured or that the media might do censorship or fake news (arguing that Twitter censors stuff to 'protect' the public from fake news) and she doesn't even wanna see evidence to the contrary at all.</p>
<p>When I told her of the violent BLM and Antifa protests in the US and wanted to show her video footage of them, she refused to see the video and argued that BLM was in the right to get 'a little' more aggressive since they (black people) were just defending themselves against racism (what, by assaulting people and burning property down?). And it's not just her.</p>

        <p>For real. I don't even talk with most of my acquaintances about anything politics related anymore, just to save myself the headache and possible criticism/scorn.</p>
<p>I only have one person who listens to me and takes my views seriously (though she personally doesn't completely agree with them), but even with her I'm always careful about what topics to discuss, out of worry that she might react negatively.</p>

        <p>I saw the craziest report on DW where they were assuring the audience that the majority of Germany actually support the new lockdown bill, based on a poll that the lady did not name, as they were discussing the mass protests that were happening across the country. Like what fucking poll lady? A poll isn't the same as a vote, and it's insane they're using arbitrary poll results to define public sentiment sentiment for public policy.</p>

        <p>Imagine if people were allowed to vote on the lockdown decision, like they vote for president, mayor, etc. Then again MSM could've still convinced the side with the 'correct' opinion that the ones with the 'wrong' opinion are bad and their side consists of flat earthers, nazis and conspiracy theorists so even then it wouldn't have been entirely fair. It's still better than a random poll though.</p>

I listen to the news radio for 10 minutes a day to see what’s happening but as soon as they start talking about COVID I turn it off. I’m going to base my life on real life and the internet fantasy land where big tech is actively trying to condition people to accept this over reach.</p>

        <p>Totally. I’m in LA where we supposedly are in another lockdown and have a curfew, but you’d hardly know it in real life. Traffic has been insane lately, stores are packed (the ones that are allowed to be open), and people seem to be more ok hanging out now despite the numbers being so much higher. Of course hardly anything is open, and now they just got rid of outdoor dining, but people are absolutely not staying home like they did before.</p>

        <p>They are. Even on this site.  I initially came to reddit because of all of the creative, critical,  free thinkers.  Not so much now. I've watched a handful of truth seekers disappear just in the past 60 days. Crazy this sub has to exist. But theres no room for civil discussion in most other subs here.</p>
<p>Instead, if anyone has an opposing thought, a counter idea to the propaganda,  they are censored.  The heavy censorship on social media seemed to take off around August 2020. Lots of banned accounts, shadow banning, facebook jail, suspensions on Twitter, removed posts/comments. </p>
<p>Mods on here dogpile with the help of their minions. Its obvious.  Stay safe, sheep. Youre just about ready for slaughter.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I think that the bulk of the lockdown supporters online and on TV are paid because everyone in my area while like myself believing that the coronavirus exists are not for mask mandates nor lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I am a wholesaler and travel to different accounts to conduct business. Most of these are small mom and pop stores. Every single time I visit them and there are no customers in the store, the masks come off. Most people are sick of it. Most people do not know anyone that has died from it and very few that have become even moderately sick. The entire next door neighbor family had it (confirmed) and only the overweight mom got sick and she recovered with OTC meds within a week. The rest of the family experienced only mild symptoms.</p>

        <p>"The Media" also said there would be a Big Blue Wave of Democrats elected on Novmber 3rd and we're <em>embarrassingly wrong, too</em>. They barely won the presidency (which may in fact uncover massive voter fraud by the Democrats...) </p>
<p>The media chose to ignore Eighty Million voters in their analysis indicating <em>extreme media bias</em>.  Why?</p>

        <p>Definitely Agree - but I can say there are many people in my life and who I work with who at the very least are putting on the appearance of being scared of Covid.  I have noticed covid fatigue the last month and many are still celebrating T-Day, but there is a lot of compliance going on still.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure it's a no brainier that no body supports the lockdown, no one is chest pumping that it might happen again. I don't even think it's a left or right thing. It's just a natural reaction to being limited to what you can and how you do it. Ill admit I'm left leaning most of the time and work with left leaning people and it's not betrayal that the lockdown is bad or dirty secret. We hate it too. It's not exclusive to one type of people. I honestly don't know or heard of a person that likes lockdown real or on the internet.</p>

        <p>Of course they are.</p>
<p>They're making it seems like there's a scientific consensus that PCR tests are reliable, that Covid-19 !s a very dangerous virus, that lockdowns actually work, that masks are effective, etc.</p>
<p>They're making it seem like that ICUs are full and hospitals are overwhelmed... or that if they aren't overwhelmed that this is exclusively due to the lockdown measures.</p>
<p>And they're making it seem like only tin toil hat wearing morons could possibly think that the official narrative is problematic.</p>
<p>None of this is true. But if you only watch the mainsteam media, you're probably going to believe it nonetheless!</p>

        <p>I worked as a residential service technician all year, and I've been going inside 4 or more homes for 6 days a week during the entire "pandemic".</p>
<p>I can tell you from first hand experience that the vast majority of people are straight up done with masks, lockdowns, and social distancing. </p>
<p>The company I worked for told every customer that they HAD to wear a mask when I was working in their home, but almost none of them ever did. And the ones who did, they took theirs off as soon as they saw me without mine.</p>
<p>You're right that's it's a noisy minority. It looks like everyone cares when you go to the store and 99% of people have a mask on, but most of those people are just wearing it out of fear or social obligation.</p>

        <p>Yes. Talk to people: ask them (like a cashier, it it's not busy) how long they think masking mandate will stay?
 It seems like a pretty tough question... Usually gets them tinking and revealing their stance.</p>
