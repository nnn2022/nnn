<title>Ok guys... Second day of hiking, check this out... Also I tried to get pics of them, but there were people walking ALONE out there, wearing masks. One lady was the only one in a group with a mask, and her friend wanted a pic with her so she goes "wanna take your mask off for the pic?" "No, I'm ok"</title>
