    <strong>Hotel Quarantine. Aka, down right ridiculous.</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm just curious, does anyone know of anyone, or even yourself. That was involved in this situation with traveling ? I'm wanting to travel out east to NB (Canada) withing a couple months, and if you're vax you dont have to quarantine, oh but God forbid US who are not vax have to self isolate alone quarantine for up to 2 weeks. Or whenever the stupid test results come back, oh yea, and you have to pay out of your own pocket. Fucking stupid.</p></p>

        <p>It makes no sense at all considering the vax doesn’t prevent you from catching or spreading the virus. I actually think if there is a virus with such mild symptoms you have to get tested to know you have it then get vaxed, let’s go along with the narrative and say the vax makes the symptoms less severe than they already were, vaxed people have more of a chance to catch and then unknowingly spread it… because of less symptoms than the none you already have</p>

        <p>My brother travels frequently for work and has had to hotel quarantine 3 times so far (apparently his work is not essential i.e medical field). His stays in the quarantine hotel have ranged from 8-14 hours. But you still need to pay for all 3 nights, no refund. It's all a gimmick. No extra security or sanitation. He was allowed to uber from the airport to the hotel, which defeats the purpose of quarantining/no contact. Such a scam, you can just wait in the airport at that point for your pcr test if it takes 8 hours....but in reality it probably takes 1 hour but they don't give results for at least 8 to justify the stay...</p>
