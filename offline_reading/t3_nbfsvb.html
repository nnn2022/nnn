    <strong>This whole thing screams cult.</strong>
    <p><p>Their shrine is the screen. TV, phone, computer, etc. They must check in as often as possible to worship and pray before the altar. </p>
<p>Their prophets are the people on the screen who pass on the will of their god. The prophets are unquestionable. They are oracles, foretelling self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
<p>Their masks are the sacred cloths that identify fellow members. </p>
<p>Their vaccines are their salvation, the magic serum that saves them from the boogie monster, and ushers in a false sense of freedom and security, providing neither.</p>
<p>Their god is "the science" which is as fickle as the wind. Always changing, never sure. "The science" determines all things; what to do, how to do it, what not to do, etc. Like the wind, you cannot actually know (grasp) "the science"; it takes the skill and finesse of a prophet to interpret the divine word. The acolytes are not so keen as to be able to understand "the science", so they rely on their priests for guidance. </p>
<p>And of course, behind the scenes, you have psychopaths pulling strings and making a shit ton of money off of everyone's ignorance, gullibility, and compliance.</p>
<p>When someone asks you to join a cult, you say:</p>
<p>"No, thanks."</p></p>

        <p>Their leaders aren't accountable to them in any sense. They're children abdicating all responsibility to the so-called adults in the room.</p>

        <p>Just remember the internet has forever memory. Be nice and be civil to this cult. No one knows the outcome of this great test on the human race. They may need you and you will know who to help and who not to. The best thing is they can't say its not true as they are the 10 year study.</p>
