        <p>This is from One America News. Derek Sloan was with the Conservatives - he was one of the contenders for leading the Conservatives but then Erin O'Toole, the absolute loser, won the race.</p>
<p>So, Derek Sloan has now been kicked out of the Conservative Party for being anti-lockdown. His interview here is pretty good. I thought Canadians might like to see it and know that someone on Parliament Hill is fighting for them.</p>

        <p>Think the PPC has any shot in the next election? Being from Ontario I can tell you maybe 10% of people will vote liberal and even life long conservatives won't vote for O'Toole. I don't think anyone will really vote NDP either. So Maxine Bernier might have a chance, even though I believe Trudeau will rig the next election. He has already talked about day after mail in voting.</p>

        <p>I fully expect Trudeau to rig the election. I don't know how anyone can come to a different conclusion with the mail-in voting. This must be why they're keeping the lockdowns going so hard, to justify it.</p>
<p>Having said that, I think Bernier has a good shot if we can get the word out and on the small chance that the election won't be rigged. I'm telling everyone I know about him. I'm on Twitter even though I hate it there just to get his name and videos out there. I personally feel I don't have a choice because I absolutely will not vote for any of the other parties ever again. I wasn't even going to bother voting anymore at all, but then I thought I might as well give it this one last shot.</p>

        <p>I refused to vote during the last election, first time in my short life. I'm embarrassed I voted  for Doug ford. The wrong brother died, Rob had his issues but he was for the people. Even with the crack he had less issue than most of are politicians these days. I truly believe the PPC party could win the election. The recent Derek Sloan interview he states that 6/10 Canadians don't have a party they relate to. The election fraud will be tougher to get away now that the Patriots in the United States are exposing the real truth behind there election. The Arizona audit has opened a can of worms, which is calling for audits in other states now. </p>
<p>Now what's your doomsday outlook on Canada? I will not be getting the vaccine ever, you think they could put us in re-education camps? I am planning on leaving the country after August as I assume they will take the case numbers and relock us down again. The destruction of are top military generals is what truly worries me.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't know what the outlook is for Canada. I mostly think things are headed to a really dark place here, with social credit scores and tracking in addition to a communism style of government. Full China takeover, basically. </p>
<p>The military stuff - we've seen this with Obama. He decimated the military generals. I am not surprised at all that this is happening in Canada. The Dems and our politicians take their marching orders from the same people/groups.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think if things go well in the US with the election rigging becoming general knowledge, etc, that could mean better things for us up here. I think that has a real chance of happening because of Arizona, as you mentioned. It all hinges on the US.</p>
<p>I will never get the vaccine. It's not even about the vaccine at this point for me. The more draconian it gets here the more resolved I am not to give in. I don't care what anyone says, they can't shame me.</p>
<p>My husband and I are making exit plans, too. We are trying to get into the US but if that doesn't work we're looking at Mexico. My son is moving to Japan. He's 21 and feels there is no future here for him.</p>
<p>I'm trying to support the justice foundations we have that are fighting the lockdowns, vaccines, etc - The Justice Centre, and the Canadian Constitution Foundation are two I've found so far.</p>

        <p>The sad part to me is how it feels like some people want a social score....</p>
<p>I do agree it all hinges on the US, it feels like the brainwashed Canadians are starting to see the states living there life and forgetting about covid 19. Coincidently right when Rand Paul connects Fauci to the Wuhan lab. </p>
<p>I've always been a cup half full person and proud to be Canadian but that is gone now. I have tried to convince my family to come with me but they think I'm crazy even though I show them proof from doctors, lawyers and politicians. They can't even argue the facts, I don't understand how people have become so blind to the truth. A part of me knows it's because they're scared of the truth and as long as they have there cosy life here nothing bad can happen to them. I try to explain to them that the Canadian economy is about to collapse when they decide to raise interest rates. Which I believe will be sooner than later. Trudeau can enact the emergency act if there's a financial crisis in Canada. </p>
<p>Are you talking about jccf.com? </p>
<p>Canadianphysicians.org has given me some hope as well. </p>
<p>Don't know what to think of Chris sky.</p>
<p>Also will be following Derek Sloan commission investigation, even though I believe it will go no where. It feels like the agenda has there people everywhere.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I do not like my country or most of my fellow citizens these days, unfortunately. I'm ready to leave them all behind. At the same time, I kind of feel it's better to bring on the pain here quickly and maybe that's what it will take to wake Canadians up. This anti-Americanism and ostrich-like tendencies Canadians have is going to be our downfall.</p>
<p>I think watching hockey games on TV will really highlight how draconian we are living to many Canadians. They can't deny that the US is open when they check their social media, reality tv, and sporting events on TV.</p>
<p>Yes, I meant jccf.com. I will check out Canadianphysicians.org, thanks.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about Chris Sky. I had a brief look at his Twitter but that's about it.</p>
<p>It's hard to trust any kind of investigation or royal commission if that happens - its hard to trust court cases, etc - everyone is so bought off and/or authoritarian.</p>
<p>Ford's announcement this afternoon will hopefully piss off a lot of Ontarians. I'm hoping they'll start ignoring the mandates finally. Missing out on a beautiful summer might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.</p>

        <p>Agree completely on the court cases. I believe that if doctors stand up and educate Canadians about the truths we will have a fighting chance. Even though not a single one of these doctors or declarations will make national news  If one of these politicians fall the rest will be quickly behind them. </p>
<p>Have you happened to read about the great Barrington declaration? It is a stretch that we will get another Nuremberg trial, but I have been following Reiner Fuellmich and his team since October when he released his first video. His videos are extremely censored on the internet, which leads me to believe he's on to something important. His legal team was the ones to take down VW over the diesel, and the deutsche bank which is truly beyond impressive. If you haven't followed him, I would recommend it. I can send you his recent Videos I have found. The USA will free themselves but his team can free the world. I have spent hours trying to debunk him and his team members and cannot find anything negative. Except opinion pieces that exclude information of course. </p>
<p>There is going to be a great reset no matter what. Whether it's a end to democracy or the end of globalism only time will tell. </p>
<p>Either way thank you for conversation!</p>

        <p>I checked out the physicians' website you mentioned and it turns out I had already signed the petition lol. I came across it on Twitter the other day and signed it then and there.</p>
<p>Yes, I've read about the GBD. I followed a few covid blogs and websites where it's been discussed:  thecovidblog.com and https://lockdownsceptics.org/author/toby-young/  are two good ones. Turns out I'd read this Toby Young's book over a decade ago and really enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I've seen Reiner Fuellmich's name mentioned on various websites and I'm hoping to do a deep dive tonight. Is he the one who filed charges with the Nuremberg Tribunal? If you don't mind linking the videos that would be appreciated. Or could I just search on rumble?</p>
<p>It gives me hope that there are smart and good people fighting for all of us. I am constantly impressed by the courage these people show, from people who write blogs or start petitions or protest or file lawsuits - it's all so brave. </p>
<p>Agree about a great reset, I am hopeful most of the time that it will be the end of globalism. I still have some faith in people that they can only be pushed so far. My job is to spread the word that this is not normal what our gov is doing, and that everyone should be mad at them instead of divided and mad at those of us fighting the gov.</p>

<p>This is a podcast with Ana Garner(she is in the top video I sent you) and Dr. Peter McCollough, who I'm sure you have heard of by now. He's actually made it on Tucker Carlson, along with testifying in front of Texas Senate which is his most famous videos.</p>

        <p>No thank you! I hate social media, have not had anything for the last 5 years. I don't consider Reddit a social media I guess. I only recently and started posting because I'm truly a concerned citizen. I have been roasting the sheoples on Canadian and Ontario sub Reddit's and starting to take pride in getting banned. It's amazing how people consider a moral high ground  to be a real argument. </p>
<p>So thank you! I wish you and your family the best! The truth will set us free!</p>

        <p>These people are the true hero's and I believe in them because they are not doing this for glory or money, it's the exact opposite  they have everything to loose and nothing to gain expect for pride. Which is the greatest motivator and the reason we will win. I believe Fuellmich when he says we will come out of this a way better world.</p>

        <p>I had to drive into Ottawa yesterday and everyone I saw downtown was wearing masks outside. When I went home (rural) no one was wearing masks outside. I was so much happier seeing bare faces.</p>
