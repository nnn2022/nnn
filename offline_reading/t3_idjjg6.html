        <p>Abstract</p>
<p>Severe influenza infection represents a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. Although influenza is primarily considered a viral infection that results in pathology limited to the respiratory system, clinical reports suggest that <strong>influenza infection is frequently associated with a number of clinical syndromes that involve organ systems outside the respiratory tract</strong>. A comprehensive MEDLINE literature review of articles pertaining to <strong>extra‚Äêpulmonary complications of influenza infection</strong>, using organ‚Äêspecific search terms, yielded 218 articles including case reports, epidemiologic investigations, and autopsy studies that were reviewed to determine the clinical involvement of other organs. The <strong>most frequently described clinical entities were viral myocarditis and viral encephalitis</strong>. Recognition of these extra‚Äêpulmonary complications is critical to determining the true burden of influenza infection and initiating organ‚Äêspecific supportive care.</p>

        <p>And yes, I know they say ‚Äúwell there‚Äôs a flu vaccine,‚Äù first of all, the reason the CDC promotes the flu vaccine is because of how ducking bad the flu is. </p>
<p>&rt; A 2012 meta-analysis found that flu vaccination was effective 67 percent of the time; the populations that benefited the most were HIV-positive adults aged 18 to 55 (76 percent), healthy adults aged 18 to 46 (approximately 70 percent), and healthy children aged six months to 24 months (66 percent).</p>
<p>So how are we supposed to make a novel vaccine that protects the elderly and the obese??? And even the flu vaccine which is done every year can‚Äôt do better than 67%. That‚Äôs a solid D grade, not even a D+ and we all know it. </p>
<p>Is there any data on the number of people who died from coronavirus who <em>had</em> gotten a flu shot? Wouldn‚Äôt that be interesting to know either way?</p>

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The incidence of group A Streptococcus (GAS) invasive infections has been increasing worldwide, and there is no obvious explanation for this phenomenon. In 1993, a working group on severe GAS infections was established to define accurately what constitutes an invasive infection. Three types of infection are particularly feared: necrotizing fasciitis, myositis and a newly defined entity, named streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) because of a certain analogy with its staphylococcal counterpart. GAS produces many toxins responsible for its clinical manifestations. Some of them, labelled streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, have been characterized as superantigens. These proteins play a key role in initiating the immune response to GAS and are mostly responsible for the precipitous course of invasive infections. <strong>Death rates are high in streptococcal invasive infections, ranging from about 20% for necrotizing fasciitis to almost 100% for myositis</strong>. Therapy consists mainly of high doses of antibiotic combinations, aggressive surgery, and intravenous administration of immunoglobulins for STSS.</p>

        <p>At first I thought it would help our case to point out that we've lived with this risk our entire lives. But doomers are starting to believe we should continue to live this way especially every winter, so save influenza lives now. üò≥</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre right. I saw a post about Oregon adopting the measures permanently and the webpage said ‚Äúnow that coronavirus has shed light on the dangers of infections disease.‚Äù</p>
<p>Its pretty much admitting that we‚Äôre only caring about this because the media told us to.</p>
