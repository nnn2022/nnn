    <strong>What I think it will happen in the upcoming months, the next phase.</strong>
    <p><p>I think that what's comming is pretty obvious. They will accelerate the massive vaccination process, perhaps test the vaccination passport in some places, then the summer will come, the cases will drop, in places like France, Italy, Spain etc people will turn off the TV and go to the lake, beach, mountains. They will be so exausted that they won't even eat to talk about the virus and will enjoy their happy virus free time, the media will make believe that cases are dropping because the vaccine and people will like and accept the idea. They will think everything is back to normal again, they will think that the government's can't afford more lockdowns. Then the summer will be over, people will be more at home, the cold weather will be back, the people will turn on the TV again to find out that cases are rising up again. At this point some lockdowns will start again, media will start the fear campaign again. They will say a newer deadlier more contagious strain is out, at this point maybe they will start to actually use the vaccine passports and new countries will use them, beacuse the new strain is much stronger this will forse people to be vaccinated again regardless if they been vaccinated or not. At this point people will accept this new reallity where you need to get vaccinated at least twice a year. </p>
<p>What are your guesses for the upcoming months?</p></p>

        <p>A more open and active summer is our chance to spread the gospel of what has happened and what is to come. Reach as many people and groups as you can, we will only have a short window.</p>

        <p>Actually last summer happened something similar, I did talked with all the people I knew and I said if we don't discuss about what happened it will happen again during the winter and they all told me that it wasn't possible to have another lockdown that the economy could no afford this, even country leaders say this. I said if we don't make the point of the situation and know where we stand it will happen again even if authority now say otherwise. And it did happen.</p>

<p>We have the benefit of hindsight now, it was a shocking enough experience and still new enough that most people were unwilling to accept reality. There are more cracks in the narrative now and more examples of the goal posts moving. It's now or never.</p>

        <p>As soon a stores and restaurants open anywhere people flock to them. They want a return to normal but don't think expressing it is socially acceptable and fear the consequences of fines and arrests.</p>

<p>They are already getting it into people’s minds that this virus is mutating and may be more harmful in the future.</p>

        <p>I think it will only get worse. Sure, beaches and mountains will b busy bc it is hard for the state to close them, and the state doesn’t mind them anyway bc they don’t compete with amazon. I’m looking to see if the teachers unions are able to stay home come september. Even if not, life will continue just as now, everyone in masks, and small business, restaurants, and theatres hampered. Vaccines being required more and more. I believe masks are permanent, but going 100% unmasked would be the indicator of normalcy for me.</p>

        <p>What you guys think about new war, is it gonna happen? Local in EU and US or even worldwide?</p>
<p>My point is - I believe we gotta have those waves and real deaths, which is gonna be caused by vaccination, but they'll tell us it's all new deadly virus strain, so they'll lock us down once again untill, as op says, we'll have covid passports, but still will have lockdowns. At this point will be a major catastrophy in middle class  and therefore collapse of the existent western government models. This will uncover old controversies between (weak at this point) countries and nations, se we gon' have some territorial changes.</p>
<p>But don't mind me, I love to think about fictions. I randomly found and read an official document about what to do and where to hide in case of nuclear attack and it freaked me out for some reason lol</p>

        <p>I doubt a war, I think that at the end of the day countries aren't in power any more, the ones in power are the corporations behind, the corporations that actually own countries. Look at now for instance it would seem that this time all the countries have agreed to proceed same way, the media talks the same crap regardless of country or political party.</p>
