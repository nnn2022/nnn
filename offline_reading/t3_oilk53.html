    <strong>The simply reason why opposing the "New Normal" is common sense for the 99%</strong>
    <p><p>You have heard what the WEF, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation, the UN, WHO and all other supranational institutions and their goons have proclaimed their agenda is.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Even if you believe that humanity should pursue technologies that threaten the core of what our existence has always been, you must realize the track record of the oligarchs who are offering you the "salvation" to problems they themselves have created.</p>
<p>They have always had the power to improve your life. Instead they have carried out plans to hurt you and worsen your conditions over decades. Whatever good may grow on the mountain of corpses the globalist mafia has created, it will not be for you. If you make a deal with these devils, they will destroy you and give you a life that is a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>Do you think the 9/11 insider traders sleep well at night? They have detached themselves from their own humanity. Injecting mRNA today and brain chips tomorrow is no loss of humanity to these narcists and psychopaths. They cannot lose what they no longer have.</p>
<p>If you believe a higher power controls the universe and punishes such vile actions, you already made up your mind and know where you stand in humanity's darkest hour.</p>
<p>If you are agnostic or atheist, you will still see that your personal material losses from supporting the agenda will outweigh any possible gains. It is a humanist thing to understand that it is better to suffer injustice than to do injustice to your fellow humans simply because every harm you do to the community is harm that you ultimately do to yourself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It is therefore common sense for billions of people to oppose the "New Normal".</p>
<p>It is a moral obligation, a spiritual duty and a simple act of self-preservation.</p>
<p>We are all in this together. Nothing could ever divide us when we are united under the human spirit.</p>
<p>Our true identity is that of survivors. Hundreds of thousands of years we have endured ice ages, hunger, disease, tyranny and every time we have emerged alive. We are connected to all who have come before and will come after us. A thread of fate binds us together in this infinite universe. We are one, not in the Klaus Schwab hive mind but in the joy and dread of the human condition.</p>
<p>All we ever will be is human. A digital copy of a human will never be a human, just as a painting of a pipe will never be a pipe.</p>
<p>And I am happy with that because your joy is my joy and your pain is my pain.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let us use technology to serve humanity. Not to enslave it.</p></p>
