    <strong>I would not want to be a kid in this pandermic.</strong>
    <p><p>I feel for the youth these days with the COVID-19 pandemic along with all of the restrictions and media fearmongering. We've had lockdowns and restrictions along with mandatory masking.</p>
<p>Altogether, Many kids are being damaged by it all. </p>
<p>- Kids have not been able to play with friends or even their own family.</p>
<p>- Some have not been able to receive any physical affection.</p>
<p>- Some are afraid of getting the virus itself and also becoming highly germaphobic.</p>
<p>- Some are afraid that they will kill their parents, grandparents, etc.</p>
<p>- Due to lockdowns, some kids (with abusive parents or caretakers) have had to stay in abusive households with abuse getting worse even.</p>
<p>- Some have went into poverty and even starvation, especially in poor countries.</p>
<p>Additionally, some schools have implemented draconian, even cruel measures towards supposedly preventing the spread which are actually sketchy with little to no regards to mental health. Looking at my own past, I can say I would not want to have been a child during all of this. This may seem like a typical "we have failed the youth" or "think of the children" but this has been on me.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. It seems like the younger you are, the worst this shit affects you! At 25, this is bad enough on me, but I could not imagine being a child, or even a teenager going through all of this!</p>

        <p>...or after this pandemic because the youth will be blamed and shamed by society for not doing enough or not resilent enough when they finally breakdown from the chronic stress and low quality of life society created!</p>

        <p>Completely agree. And this extends to the college kids (legal adults) and new grads.</p>
<p>We’ve failed them all. I’m so sorry guys.</p>
<p>I don’t really like to think about what I’d do if I were a kid in this situation. I think it’s very likely I’d be one of the 25% who’ve contemplated suicide. I hope I would’ve been smart enough to not go through with it.</p>
