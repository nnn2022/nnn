    <strong>What is taking place is a full-on global assault on the common people of the world</strong>
    <p><p>It didn't start with the virus disinfo-/psychological operation and it isn't likely to end here either but this has become the most egregious battlefield in this war. I'd never heard of the term "gaslighting" until a few years ago in the context of someone describing it as something Donald Trump does. Now I see it everywhere. Lately I've come to recognize nearly everything Trump is accused of is actually something being actively perpetrated by the accusers (and their financiers.) No I'm not a Trumper. I'm not a Republican. I haven't voted since '00 and it was for the Green Party candidate at the time. And this isn't unique to Trump. Replace Trump with any international populist leader and the same holds true.</p>
<p>People in the media, on social media, politicians and celebrities (I hate referring to them as "the elite." The only thing that makes them "elite" or special is their money which buys them power and influence) will tell you the most obvious bald faced lies and then argue against your sanity for not accepting them. It's almost become a game of how audacious of a lie they can tell and get the world to believe. While of course it is the most obvious initial instinct, you can't use science or facts to refute these arguments via logic. In fact, they will assert science and logic is on their side. When previous arguments of theirs obviously turn out to be false they'll double-down and try to convince you the evidence that revealed they were wrong somehow vindicates their prior position. It's maddening. It's impossible to have a sane discourse in this environment. The object appears to be to not have a real discourse at all.</p>
<p>This is bigger than Democrat vs. Republican, Left vs. Right, Young vs. Old, White vs. Black, Brexit vs. Remain, Tory vs. Labour etc etc. These are pre-existing differences being leveraged by some group for some nefarious goal. At the fundamental level this sort of thing is always about power and money. Ideology is just a weapon or a tool. A means to an end. At the end of the day we're simple creatures and money actually is the root of all that's evil.</p>
<p>This is a war. It's global. It's not being fought with arms (for the most part, not yet) but with narratives and coercion. Who are the victims? It's always us. The lower and middle classes. The masses. Who is the aggressor? The powerful. The people with money and control. We don't own television networks. We don't own newspapers. We don't own social media sites. We don't finance ad campaigns. We don't control the legislatures. We don't sell drugs (the real drugs mass manufactured for astronomical profits.) We don't own large international corporations. We don't manufacture weapons of war that need to be used in order to justify their development and purchase.  We don't run non-governmental international health organizations.</p>
<p>Our enemy is the ultra wealthy and powerful. It's not each other. When we get tricked into believing we're fighting each other we've lost. That's how these people win. I'm not a communist. I'm not a socialist. I think there's probably a responsible way to enact capitalism but that's not what's going on in the world. There is a monopoly of power and influence. Until that is addressed there will be more virus scares, more race baiting, more virtue signaling, more scolding, more hate. Anything and everything in order to keep us fighting each other. I don't know how we take them on but I know we can only do it together. I also know populist leaders seem to be scaring the ever loving shit out of the powerful. How do I know? By the increasing intensity of the insanity I've outlined. These are extreme panic reactions. I don't know if populist leaders are strictly on our side but they certainly appear to not be on the side of the true power in this world. My instincts are to keep supporting populists, especially those who talk (and act!) about penalizing monopolistic organizations. But there is probably more that can be done and I'm open to ideas. I just ask that you think about this before labeling everyone who disagrees with you as a troll. There are obvious professional astro-turfers operating out there but you can pick them out easily just by browsing someone's comment history. If you see someone arguing with you is a real person, albeit one who has been manipulated, try a little compassion. It may go a long way and be reciprocated. There is common ground. We're the commoners of the world. It's our world.</p></p>

        <p>Research the Gilded Age in the US. Literally same shit, different century. No global pandemic, but huge recession and consolidation of wealth at the top. The robber barons used government to their advantage and average people went from small business owners to wage earners beholden to the whims of the barons.</p>
