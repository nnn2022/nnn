    <strong>Please Check my Math and Reasoning</strong>
    <p><p>I'm trying to determine a breakpoint for when the risk of serious harm from the new vaccines is greater than the benefit of not developing severe Covid.  For the vaccine side I'm using the AZ since it's notorious for fatal blood clots, and there's more data points than the J&amp;J one.  Since the condition from the AZ vaccine is very similar to heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), I'm using that to compare.  I'm not going to link actual sources for the sake of space, but I did use the CDC and WHO.</p>
<p>One use of heparin is to treat pulmonary embolisms (PE), which have a 30% fatality rate untreated.  Inferred ifr for Covid in people under age 70 is about 0.1% (1000/million).  So, PEs are 300x more deadly.  </p>
<p>The incidence of HIT is 0.2 % (2000/million) and is 30% (300k/million) fatal if untreated.  We treat this 0.2% incidence and 30% mortality of HIT as acceptable risk.</p>
<p>To adjust for how much deadlier PEs are vs Covid we divide the HIT incidence by 300 (2000 per million/300) 6.67/million.  Since HIT is 300x deadlier, the acceptable risk for Covid should be 300x less. <br>
This is our acceptable risk for vaccine related blood clots, fatal and non-fatal.</p>
<p>Multiply this by 0.3 (30%) to adjust for only fatal clots, and you get 2/million.</p>
<p>Based on these figures, I'm placing the breakpoint at 2 deaths/million due to vaccine related blood clots, and 6.67/million for fatal and non-fatal clots.  Above this number, the risks outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>The AZ vaccine causes fatal blood clots in 4/million people.  So, the incidence of non-fatal clots, should be 13.3/million based on the HIT figures (4/0.3).  Therefore, this vaccine shouldn't be used in people under age 70.</p></p>

        <p>Based on the numbers you got, yes your sentiment makes sense</p>
<p>HOWEVER,</p>
<p>There is a lot of bad data and misinformation out there, especially with COVID, itâ€™s variants, and vaccines. Therefore, I would be high skeptical of any conclusions drawn off of data, whether I generally agree with them or not.</p>

        <p>That's why I stuck with WHO and CDC.  May not be 100% reliable, but it's the best I could find.</p>
