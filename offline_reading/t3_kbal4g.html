    <strong>Is it working? Is the constant shaming &amp; judgment working yet?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s been 10 months of shaming, judgment &amp; scorn from the chattering social media class over Covid. At one point you would get doxxed for even stepping foot outside your home.</p>
<p>Has it worked yet? Has calling people “covidiots” &amp; wishing death on people just trying to not put a gun in their mouth worked? As mobility increases &amp; more people say fuck it, do the sanctimonious twats need to keep going? The definition of insanity is doing something repeatedly hoping for a different outcome. </p>
<p>Seems like calling people “murderers” &amp; “selfish” just isn’t really doing it if the airport where I dropped off friends headed to Disneyworld is any indication. It was packed, triple parking on the curb, line of cars down the ramp up to departures, every single age demographic represented in those headed into the airport.</p>
<p>The scolding, the judgment, the non stop nagging isnt doing anything except driving people off social media. My friends said I and their parents are the only ones who know they’re going to Disneyworld. They won’t be sharing pics or check ins. Nothing. They’re just done and that’s just one family. </p>
<p>The shaming &amp; the judging is doing what it has always done: driven people underground to do what they were otherwise prevented from doing. Did shaming during the AIDS crisis stop unprotected sex in the gay community? Nope. Die shaming during prohibition stop people from drinking? Nope! Speakeasies are now a glorified part of our culture. </p>
<p>Humans really fucking suck at this kind of shit. We never learn. Shaming &amp; judging does not stop behavior. Period.</p></p>

        <p>Netherlands here. Some woman at work was still talking about wearing a mask as a sign of respect a few weeks ago. All the talk about mandatory vaccines and curfews made her think this is going too far, and now she's on the other side. I don't think she's an anomaly.</p>

        <p>This is why the pro-lockdown doomer drones keep getting more and more angry and belligerent.  They're losing people from their side every single day, fewer and fewer people are buying into their bogus messaging, and they've got nothing going for them aside from the same handful of "facts" they've been parroting since March.  Anger, frustration, personal attacks and profanity is all they have left to fall back on.</p>

        <p>Good point about the other crises and the hypocrisy apparent in the doomers' behaviour. If it's ok to shame people for disobeying lockdown, then it's also ok to shame people for being gay, for being alcoholics, for doing drugs, for being mentally ill, etc etc. These people cannot see the contradictions in their own logic.</p>

        <p>I’ve got some covid burnout and I suddenly completely don’t care. I hit a sudden threshold and I’m done. It may have coincided with a severe bacterial infection I got on my face from the combo of my usual chronic cystic acne and wearing a mask. $500+ at the doctor and a negative covid test to get some antibiotics. I’ve worn my mask like a proper rule follower this whole time. </p>
<p>I’m done. The mask hangs on my chin now. Pretty soon I’ll go naked faced as much as possible. Fuck it. My toddler comes with me everywhere and he doesn’t wear a mask so why would I? We live in the same house and are within the same ten feet pretty much constantly. The lack of sense in these “rules” is what really kills me. I’m an engineer, I think logically. There is nothing logical about people having to wear masks while walking through a restaurant or gym and then taking it off when you get to the table or the treadmill.</p>
<p>People have been done. They celebrated thanksgiving. They’re traveling. They’re living as best as they can. But the pressure on businesses and events is still extreme and that sucks. Where I live they have businesses at 25% capacity until JUNE. Doing my part and going on vacation to Florida soon, after covid cancelled my trip to Aruba in March.</p>

        <p>So sorry to hear about your skin acting up. I struggle with acne sometimes and feel so bad for anyone forced to wear a mask all day if they suffer from acne/excema etc. I'm seeing lots of adverts for skincare that helps 'maskne', wtf the best thing is to wear a mask as little as possible, skincare can't undo 12 hours or wearing a mask all day.</p>

        <p>The shaming for sure doesn't have the intended effect on me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaming would work if I'd think I'm doing something wrong. But I don't.</li>
<li>The more shaming, the more bullying, the less sane and pleasant these people appear. The mindlessness just shows (especially with empty repeated phrases), and it makes me even less eager to comply, because I don't want to belong to that group of people or dentify with that crowd</li>
<li>I don't want to reward their bullying and pressuring</li>
<li>I see the complete lack of empathy or compassion in their words. With how they brush people's suffering due to ''measures'' aside, they show to be devoid of true compassion imo. I've seen people say <em>horrible</em> things, and what they want to force on people is cruel and ruthless (''I want to kill myself these days''----''mask up and shut up you selfish moron'')</li>

        <p>Social shaming, gossip, and ostracizing people for breaking social norms has several thousand years of being an effective strategy for reinforcing what's considered acceptable behavior. Given the US is nearing 300k largely avoidable deaths it's not inappropriate to shame people for going to fucking Applebees without a mask.</p>

        <p>The difference is that you guys are actual fucking losers. If one of my friends acted like you I might listen, but every single doomer I’ve seen has been a shut-in nerd hall monitor. How do you expect me to take your ‘social shaming’ seriously when you were the antisocial weirdos getting bullied 10 months ago?</p>

        <p>Well it sure as hell isnt working now. Keep using that 300k number! Maybe it’s fooling those who are unaware of what’s really going on but our for-profit healthcare system is marking any death as covid with a positive test even after death. That means if someone’s liver stops working entirely after being on dialysis and barely alive for years and they die because that’s what happens when your liver is destroyed and they test the dead body for viral fragments, that’s now a covid death. Except they didn’t die from covid, they died because they were dying for years and now the hospital gets extra money because they may have nosocomially come in contact with covid after dialysis was keeping them alive for years. For fucks sake people die and covid is not the only thing that kills them but you can bet this shit system is gonna get their paper and keep the American fear juiced as long as possible. To hell with civilization as long as Banner Health gets their money run.</p>

        <p>Again, do you know how many people have died and the disruptions this virus has caused because of the inept leadership the US has? Is "the new normal" just about not giving a shit or being so anti-science that this is seen as a hoax? If so fuck this community. That's what I get sorting by new.</p>

        <p>Vast majority of disruptions are caused by the government, not the virus itself. Blaming the US government for pretty much any number of deaths caused by covid-19 is just ridiculous, they are not responsible for our health, we are. And if you really want to blame the government for the amount of deaths, then you also need to blame each individual governor and the leadership of every other country as well. The US isn't even in the top 10 for deaths per 100k and we aren't even in the top 50 for CFR.</p>
