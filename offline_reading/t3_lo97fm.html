    <strong>32 years old but can say this for a fact</strong>
    <p><p>If I were eighty and had four health conditions, I'd nonetheless be appalled that government are wreaking havoc on younger generations while giving the impression it's so I can have two more years while they keep me locked in my sterile care home. Disgraceful.</p>
<p>But, as a 32 year old, I would absolutely accommodate and sacrifice for the elderly, <em>where and when it makes sense</em>, when it's voluntary, when it's not driven by sub-standard science and incompetent compromised health officials.</p>
<p>Just like we did with the first lockdown, when we were told it was just three weeks. And we didn't do it grudgingly. It seemed like the best thing to do. The greater good. And MAY even have been the best thing back then.</p>
<p>Not now and that bubble has burst (for some of us thank god). I hope I meet people like you soon who want to live in a sane world where YOU are in control of your life and health.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></p>

        <p>Florida is fucking awesome, I will caution you on the ‚Äúbetter weather‚Äù though. It‚Äôs better 7-8 months a year in most of the state compared to most of the world. BUT, Florida summers can be absolutely brutal. This applies to all of the state mostly, but south/central Florida in July/August is horrible to be outside for more than an hour or two.</p>

        <p>Florida is a gapping hole of hell that can literally swallow you at any time. Lol! To even pretend it‚Äôs more sane people than crazies is hilarious. Anytime Americans hear the most unbelievable, bizarre, and ridiculous stories that seem to come from a twisted M. Night Shyamalan movie, we don‚Äôt even have to guess; we know it‚Äôs something that happened in Florida. </p>
<p>Guy brings alligator into convenient store as his date, Florida. Man eats homeless man‚Äôs face off, Florida. Man eats neighbors relaxing in garage, Florida. Man throws three day house party with dead parents in the same home, Florida. Woman makes bomb at Walmart, Florida. Get the idea?</p>

        <p>Tnx man. I don‚Äôt mean to rain on your parade, but I think anything more than 5% wearing masks would irritate me as much as me myself wearing one. It feels dystopic, and in my city at least, dangerous (crime).</p>

        <p>There was a speech I watched where the guy pointed out that all through human history the old have always sacrificed and worked for the young, that almost the entire point of being old is to give to the young and make sure they have a good life, as well as enjoy your late years. And for the first time ever, the young are expected to sacrifice everything for the old and if you really think about it, it makes no sense whatsoever. It's like a 5 year old having to go to work to support his 36-year old father. It's reversed and it doesn't work naturally.</p>
<p>If I was old, I would feel ASHAMED to think that I was preventing young people from living their lives. I wouldn't want that at all. I'd encourage them to go on living. Not for my sake but for their own. I got to live a life and it would be selfish for me to insist that they don't on my behalf, even though I only have a few years left anyway. Furthermore, I wouldn't even care about the risk for myself if it meant I couldn't see my grandchildren and family. If you only have a few years left, what is more important to you: staying alive, or spending the time you have left with those you love?</p>
<p>I am 30, so I'm kind of in the same age range as you.</p>

        <p>Been saying this to myself since the damage of lockdowns became clear: If someone told me I was dying tomorrow, and the only way to save me was to destroy young people's education, destroy countless small businesses, stop children from socializing, and plunge millions of people into debt or outright poverty.</p>
<p>It would take me about two seconds to say, "Thanks for the time I've had, I wish you the best."</p>

        <p>I agree. I think if they had done it that way it would've made sense to people and people would've naturally been more careful, but the point wasn't to make sense and do what was best for everyone. I'm not sure what the point even is, but it definitely seems like control and possibly the great reset. Without all this security theater and MSM propaganda, people wouldn't even know there was a "pandemic". </p>
<p>I'm hoping to meet more like minded people as well. If this ever goes back to normal, I don't even want to associate with anyone else.</p>

        <p>My mother is high risk, in her 70s.  Whenever I see her she gives me a big hug, she says she would prefer to die than not hug me.  We live near one another so we sometimes bump into one another at the grocery store.  We live in a lockdown state, the thing that pissed me off the most was the cancellation of her exercise classes.  Since she started those classes she has improved a lot.  For a while they would hold these classes, 70-90 year old women, in a parking lot to get around the rules, then go eat at a local place with outside seating.  The owner is a man about their age and loves the group even though he probably makes next to nothing off them, but nonetheless he offered them the use of their basement to exercise for free.  </p>
<p>Canceling elderly women's exercise classes is evil.  I can accept reasonable limits, but these are not reasonable, and the elderly often would prefer death to following them.  To them death and the lockdown are very similar.</p>

        <p>Yes! My dad and his relatives who are in their 70s and 80s all tell me the same thing, "When you're older you won't think that way!" Excuse me, you can't tell me what I will think as if you know my future, but it most certainly won't be that. I will NEVER take "safety" over freedom and no one gets to tell me what I will think in the future. And they say it so arrogantly and sure of themselves.</p>

        <p>I didn't mind the first few weeks. We knew so little, and it was a small sacrifice, with a clear objective. Now it's seemingly indefinite and we've learned so much about covid and how to treat it, but nobody even questions if this is a fair sacrifice.</p>
