    <strong>No Vaccine or Test Push</strong>
    <p><p>So yesterday both me and my girlfriend had doctor's appointments.  We were worried and stressed that there would be a lot of pressure to get vaccinated or, especially in her case, tested for Covid.</p>
<p>My appointment was first.  It was just a normal check up.  Covid or the vaccine was not even mentioned once let alone any pressure to take it.  In fact the only vague reference to Covid was when talking briefly about finances and weight gain cause of lockdowns, etc.  Which my doctor seemed more irritated by the shut downs and their effects than the virus itself.  Was a perfect opportunity to push the vaccine, not a peep.  </p>
<p>I left feeling a bit more hopeful about my girlfriend's appointment which is the one I was more worried about.  See my girlfriend has a whole host of issues, many which are keeping her from holding a job or functioning.  She's had serious fatigue for a long while, well before Covid, fatigue being a "Covid" symptom, and has had shortness of breath whenever engaging in any activity, shortness of breath also being a "Covid" symptom.  Also has migraines, which headaches are a "Covid" symptom, but is a chronic issue for her long before "Covid."  So several symptoms.  </p>
<p>So pushing Covid and asking for a test was a worry, especially as it'd mean I'd likely have to do the same and be out of work for a time.  She, however, had other symptoms as well.  Much to my surprise, however, the only real mention of Covid was the nurse asking the typical, exposure to someone who you know had Covid question and that was it.</p>
<p>The doctor listened, we talked and she got several tests, none of which were Covid tests, nor did she even mention considering it.  The vaccine also was not mentioned once with the primary care doctor or any of the other nurses she saw during her tests that day.  </p>
<p>Not a single one of our worries we had been stressing about happened, and other than a few brief things here and there and masks, it was almost like "Covid" didn't even exist.</p>
<p>I know this is all minor really, but it gives me some hope.  Doctor's may not be allowed to speak against Covid, but to an extent it seems some are rebelling against the narrative in their own way, because they apparently don't have to push it either.</p></p>

        <p>If your family doc is chill, that'd make your experience 50/50 though.  That doesn't support your far more common claim.</p>
<p>Assuming that doc is chill, just using our experience and the other person on here who got similar to mine.  So far it's 4 out of 5 not pushing covid.  Small sample size, so clearly not useable, but it does make the far more common claim a bit uncertain at minimum.</p>

        <p>That's good. My question is, where do you look to find a good doctor that isn't fully "on board" with the covid agenda and won't try and push you to get tested or get the vaccine even if you're appointment is unrelated?</p>

        <p>My Dr didn't care either. The nurse saw me pulling out my mask to breathe and immediately told me she thinks the masks are ridiculous and that she has to take frequent mask breaks. She told me she didn't care if I wore one.</p>

        <p>I don't think so either. My dentist and the dental hygienist were quiet when I saw them last summer, but last month they badly wanted to talk about how this is all ridiculous, nothing makes sense, and that it's tyrannical. They said all of this. It felt great. Most people would stop wearing a mask if the mandates went away.</p>

        <p>I'm in in-person learning due to me not liking virtual learning and I'm in my Senior Year. Due to county rules the school administration tried to quarantine me over the simple fact I had pollen allergy SNIFFLES. </p>
<p>My dad said on the phone, "This is all just a hoax." </p>
<p>The school nurse replied, "Yes. I know." </p>
<p>My brother, who also goes to the same HS, said he overheard our PE teachers talking about how dumb it was that they tried to lock me up over sniffles. Word actually got around. The system is that huge. </p>
<p>The teachers seem to think it's bullshit too. Some of them at least. They often try to enforce 6 feet but they know it's pointless and that one admitted they're only saying it because it's their job and nothing else. </p>
<p>So yeah. I'm sure COVID questioning is going to be a big thing in the future. They can't un-awake people.</p>

        <p>Dr.’s don’t have incentives to push for a shot in there office. When the “update” is pushed in fall- it’ll be hard core push for the shot- those shots won’t be government paid for. Guaranteed dr.s will get kick backs just like the yearly flu shot.</p>
