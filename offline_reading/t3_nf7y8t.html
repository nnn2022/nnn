    <strong>You can really see why the CDC has NO SCIENTIFIC basis for any of their decisions</strong>
    <p><p>Most of the articles they list on their website has been
1. Cherry picked
2. NOT Peer reviewed
3. Papers From Different scientists and doctors in china talkimg about cases in china ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
<p>ISRAEL -
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/vaccinated-people-less-likely-to-transmit-coronavirus-israeli-study-suggests/amp/
The results were published by the MyHeritage lab, which handles more than 10,000 tests a day, in a study co-authored by several prominent scholars, including leading COVID-19 statistician Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute of Science. </p>
<p>The results are only based on partial data, because MyHeritage did not know if individual samples came from patients who had been vaccinated or not. But overall, the results appear to show that once someone is vaccinated, even if they have the virus in their system, they are less likely to pass it on because they have fewer infectious SARS-CoV-2 droplets hanging around their noses and throats.</p>
<p>How we shouldnt use PCR test to test viral load as to if people can transmit the virus, but what did the CDC link to their website regarding if vaccinated people can transmit the virus? 
A article about PCR tests detecting viral loadü§Ø</p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3699?ijkey=2ea3d1e09c6e5d39c26d3c003f95c0cecbd04856&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha </p>
<p>They could do more harm than good to people, populations, and the economy </p>
<p>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab test is useful (but not perfect) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in symptomatic patients.1¬†However, problems arise using the test for purposes that disregard symptoms or time of infection‚Äînamely, case finding, mass screening, and disease surveillance. </p>
<p>This is because PCR is not a test of infectiousness. Rather, the test detects trace amounts of viral genome sequence, which may be either live transmissible virus or irrelevant RNA fragments from previous infection.2¬†When people with symptoms or who have been recently exposed receive a positive PCR result they will probably be infectious. But a positive result in someone without symptoms or known recent exposure may be from live or dead virus, and so does not determine whether the person is infectious and able to transmit the virus to others.3</p></p>

        <p>i like where you‚Äôre going but this post is a bit jumbled and meandering. </p>
<p>hard to discern your main point here.</p>
<p>PCR tests are not fit for purpose. they are being misused and the results are typically completely useless. </p>
<p>asymptomatic illness is an oxymoron. </p>
<p>and yes, the CDC is misleading with their interpretation of data and very often takes liberties with their recommendations.</p>
<p>they have done quite a bit of data manipulation, and cherry pick from their own data to support political agendas.</p>

        <p>In article 1 it is a study taking place in israel, since the cdc claims that our "real world study" in the article that admit their findings are based off of incomplete results</p>
<p>Im article 2 
It is explained why PCR should NOT be used o detect viral Load and transmission, yet the CDC main article trying proving Vaccinated individuals cannot transmit the Virus is based Off of PCR results, and almost all of their other articles are based in china, And NOT peer reviewed, </p>
<p>Its sad that people wont take the time out to research for theirselve, meaning the people that believe everything they say like they are GOD</p>
<p>I believe me and you are on the same page</p>

        <p>yes, that's because the truth is suppressed and you need to piece things together. terrain theory is seen as quackery, while the opposite is true. 
germ theory is a scientific hoax, you need to understand the science, or lack of science, to get it</p>

        <p>It's true, me too. I already knew vaccines were crap products, but that the whole basis of the alleged science behind it did not exist, was quite a shock. And I say this as someone who is already beyond red pilled in most other subjects out there.</p>
