    <strong>Hot Take: Social Conditioning of “Anti vaxxers “ started years ago.</strong>
    <p><p>Year after year the “anti vaxxers are crazy!!” Shit has been shoveled down everyone’s throats. People who didn’t trust the ingredients in the vaccines. </p>
<p>My wife and I got into an argument that I thankfully won years ago I’m which she was shitting on someone who was antivax and I told her that there are plenty of reasons to be hesitant of vaccines. Explained to her that to the parents they are trying to prevent their children from getting potentially deadly chemicals put into their bodies. Explained that someone not wanting to give their children vaccines doesn’t make them a bad parent and that all this social media shit of trashing people against vaccines is stupid and not helpful.</p>
<p>And then it hit me today. It’s kinda weird that thanks to the years of media (social and msm ) pushing the idea that antivaxxers are all inbred morons or totally hateful and evil... and now it’s the perfect bludgeoning tool to beat over our heads.</p>
<p>Ps. Myself and my son are vaccinated. I don’t think most of the shit is necessary but I weighed the risks and with the amount of 3rd world illegals America gets on a yearly basis I wasn’t risking him catching an easily preventable disease. Just stating being against any vaccine doesn’t make you a moron or inherently stupid or evil.</p></p>

        <p>Wow way to twist what I said entirely lol. Unregulated people coming from third world countries that still have viruses we eradicated decades ago is a real issue. If we knew everyone coming into the country and knew everyone was clear of the diseases you wouldn’t have near enough concern to vaccinate for it.</p>
<p>A few seconds of looking will show virus outbreaks tightly clumped in high traffic illegal border crossings.</p>
<p>You made it a race issue and I never once said a race or specific section of people. But it is a fact that illegal immigration has been a continuing problem in America for decades and it’s only gotten worse. You’re clearly not in the US so your delusional ass sees anything about illegal immigration and your head goes straight to racism. Even so far as putting the words in my mouth that I never said.</p>
<p>So kindly go fuck yourself and kindly take multiple vaccines so that we can add you to the vaccine death counts you piece of shit.</p>

        <p>Why is it that anti-vaxxers didn't exist 20 years ago? It seems like that term only popped up in the past decade. Why?</p>

        <p>Harder to whip up fury at them on social media when "social media" is mostly stuff like LiveJournal and Yahoo! Groups.</p>

        <p>I noticed how bad it was the year I decided not to vaccinate my unborn child. It has become increasingly worse ever since. I've been deleting "friends" off social media for unnecessary antivaxxer hate posts since at least 2012. I have one good friend who I unfollow for months every time she does it. She inevitably does it again soon after I check on her. She has no kids and never will, but she's preoccupied with it. I know other childless women who won't STFU about it. Random people (men and women) I meet would just start spewing hate about antivaxxers and their love of science to me for no reason whatsoever PRE covid. It's insane.</p>
