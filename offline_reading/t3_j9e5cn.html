        <p>Paywall, but the snippet I was able to read says everything we need to know.</p>
<p>How many of us said this from the very beginning - that contact tracing was going to be used to track individuals, to harvest personal information, and that businesses would sell the information they skimmed?</p>
<p>And that it ain't going away when the 'Rona is finished it's 15 minutes of fame.</p>
<p>How many government sock-puppets and corporate shills accused us of wearing tinfoil hats, of being "conspiracy theorists"? How can even the most blinkered average member of the public not see what is going on???</p>

        <p>Ten years ago, when I told Facebook to take a flying leap, I was asked "Why are you leaving?  You'll fall out of contact with so many people!" (I didn't, but since so many people relied on social media for mass communication back then, I've still missed out on a helluva lot).  I cited privacy concerns- I'd stuck with Facebook for ten months or so, since it was least-invasive option, as far as I could tell, but enough was enough.  I was laughed at.</p>
<p>Now?  Now it doesn't matter what they do.  The only two groups remaining are those who don't care, because they'll stick it out anyway, and those who don't care because they've already left.  Same thing here.</p>

        <p>Facebook is the worst.</p>
<p>Remember couple of years ago when they asked for your nude pictures so they can help "secure" it? Supposedly it will help you protect against boyfriends that are angry and will leak, or some such nonsense.</p>
<p>Right, like the employees won't jack off to your nude pics and share it among themselves! </p>
<p>If the TSA agents with blurry, barely recognizable nude scans were making fun of them and distributing the scans around, how much more eager will Facebook employees do the same with full uncovered, clear pictures they get from their users?</p>

        <p>To the surprise of absolutely fucking nobody with two brain cells to rub together. Bear in mind that you can ask to write your number on a piece of paper instead.</p>
