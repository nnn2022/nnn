    <strong>Is anyone ready to divorce their spouse, or cut-off their family, because they've become too extreme about COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>My spouse and I have always differed when it came to politics - he's a liberal and I'm a right leaning moderate. However, I'm not really passionate about politics or any of that stuff, so I never really got upset when we'd disagree on particular topics. And in all honesty, most of the core things we agree on anyway. </p>
<p>However with this COVID crap I am ready to file for divorce. </p>
<p>He has become so extreme and aggressive. </p>
<p>I don't want the vaccine, he got it right away. I don't care that he got it, but it really bothers him that I haven't. Every few weeks now I can always count on him to bait me into a COVID debate, which usually ends with him talking to me like I'm just an uneducated subhuman. He gets really self-righteous and condescending. And if I don't just shut down and ignore him, I'll eventually get mad (because who likes being talked to like they're dumb) and then everything will go left. </p>
<p>Over the weekend we had brunch plans with a few of his friends, and they disinvited me because I'm "unvaccinated" and they didn't want me to potentially infect their two toddlers. Whatever. I didn't want to go anyway. </p>
<p>So I'm on FaceTime with one of my friends, and I'm telling her how my morning is now open because I've been disinvited from brunch. We're both kind of chuckling about it. It just seems so dramatic and over-the-top to us... Anyway, my spouse snatches my phone and starts berating my friend - he keeps asking her what's so funny. </p>
<p>My friend is fully-vaccinated. She says to him that she just can't believe people are actually disinviting their friends to things because of their vaccination status. She says she's heard of it happening on TV, but didn't know people were actually doing that in real life. </p>
<p>So I snatch my phone back from him, and I tell my friend I'll call her later.</p>
<p>Once I got off the phone, my spouse repeatedly says to me that I lack values, I'm selfish, and I should think of his friend's toddlers. </p>
<p>I didn't bother to say anything, because I'm really tired of arguing about COVID. I don't have the shot, I don't want the shot, I'm not getting the shot. If that scares your friends, then I just don't have to hang out with them. I don't feel that I need to be hysterical and paranoid about everything just because he and his friends are.</p>
<p>I have a list of reasons why I don't want it, but none of that ever seems to matter. All that matters is that I don't have it. </p>
<p>The arguing about COVID has been nonstop and ongoing, and I'm tired of it.</p>
<p>And I don't understand why he is so passionate about me getting the shot when, so far, we have 5 friends who are fully-vaccinated who currently have COVID. </p>
<p>But I'm really at my breaking point. I feel like I've lost my husband to a cult. </p>
<p>Is anyone else dealing with something like this? </p></p>

        <p>Sorry to hear of your situation.</p>
<p>I've purged a few close people from my life over the last 12 months, simply because they bait me into arguments knowing full well my stance on what is happening, then try to ridicule me with state-sponsored insults (5g, Bill Gates, Flat Earth etc) when I ask a question they haven't been programmed to answer.  I.e. why do I need the vaccine if I've had Covid. </p>
<p>They can't handle that you don't believe exactly what they believe, while the media convinces them they are better, more selfless and more educated than you on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It's a weird psychological phenomenon that is growing so rapidly it's scary. I feel like it stems from a place of allowing somebody with low social status to represent a seemingly unquestionable authority, vs somebody not submitting to that authority, and, by doing so, seeing themselves as that authority.</p>
<p>It's moral superiority subtly disguised as compassion.</p>

        <p>This is brainwashing in action. </p>
<p>I say this all the time and I think most people take it as hyperbole. But it's not. The majority of the public has been literally brainwashed.</p>
<p>They've been programmed about what to believe. That's why they can't answer questions or follow a logical anti vaccine argument. Their programming didn't cover that. It's literal Jason Bourne style stuff.</p>

        <p>Very true. </p>
<p>On a side note, I randomly commented on this subreddit while browling /r/all and was immediately banned from some other subreddit just because I happened to comment here! </p>
<p>So now I'm naturally very curious about what this subreddit is all about even though I'm vaxxed (non MRNA vaccine) and had no side effects from the vaccine at all. I just had some arm pain and skipped a few workouts but was back to normal really fast. Not that it matters because I still have to wear a mask and can catch the virus lol. </p>
<p>What a joke.</p>

        <p>It's a really strange form of censorship, or maybe a way to try and get people to conform to a narrative?  I would like to think that someone wouldn't abandon their principals just so they can comment on a cat picture subreddit, but the internet is a wild place.</p>

        <p>Many are literally unable to even talk about the negative effects of lockdowns for example. It's like their brain just shuts off as soon as you say something about the negative effects it's having on kids, social life, mental health or whatever, and they just instantly change the topic as if you haven't said anything. It's truly bizarre.</p>

        <p>Hi, majority of the public here. AMA, let’s see if I can follow a logical argument in your opinion. Let’s see how far I’ve been “programmed”. You are aware of course the other side feels the exact same way about you, right? 
So, seriously, let’s do it. I’ll be as cordial and polite as you need me to be. 
Rules? You name them.</p>

        <p>Lol ok. I've gone through this a hundred times, but I'll humor you. </p>
<p>First, I'd like to point out that you're not a majority of the public. You're an individual. Don't let anybody program you otherwise. </p>
<p>Next, I'm going to assume you are pro covid vaccine. I've got scruples against snooping through someone's post history, so I don't know anything about you. </p>
<p>Rules aren't necessary. What happens happens. </p>
<p>Assuming you think everybody should get the covid vaccine, why do you think that?</p>

        <p>Ok, sure, but as a starting point you’re going to have to realize the humor in saying “a majority of the public” and then having someone reply, “Hi majority of the public here”. But if you can’t do that and want to lecture me about programming again I guess I’ll leave pointless humorous banter out of it. </p>
<p>You assume correctly. Vaccination efforts have consistently proven to be effective against essentially eliminating the spread and effects of multiple minor and major illnesses caused by bacteria and viruses. The effectiveness of any/all of those vaccines is exponentially increased by the percentage of the population that is vaccinated. These particular vaccines have been proven effective and safe through expedited clinical trials that tested on the same size cohort (10’s of thousands of people) as usual, on the same trial length as usual, but faster by prioritizing the trial size and timeline.</p>

        <p>Let's limit this to the covid vaccine, considering the broader vaccine discussion is too big to cover, and also considering there are no other vaccines using the same gene therapy methods as the mRNA vaccines. </p>
<p>Next question, considering the speed at which this vaccine was developed and the fact that it hasn't been FDA approved except for emergency use, how can you say that last sentence?</p>

        <p>Ok, sure. </p>
<p>One common myth going around is mRNA is a kind of gene therapy, it is not. Gene therapy is in fact experimental in nature, but the mRNA vaccines have nothing in common with the processes used in gene therapy as they do not alter your DNA in any way. You are correct there are no other vaccines that use mRNA, but there are multiple examples of breakthroughs in medical treatment that are done every day that prior to (pick your year- 2010, 2000, 1990, 1980) have never been done before. That’s the upside of living in the future. </p>
<p>I can’t speak to why the FDA hasn’t approved anything other than emergency use at this point. There is honestly nothing stopping them from doing it, no data has shown that they should hold off, nothing has happened that would alter their final decision, but concerns like yours (which are valid by the way) are probably driving their decision to prove to the public that they will check every single box two or three times to prove safety. History shows them that 99%+ of all vaccine side effects are found within the first six months of any trial. They ran a seven month trial, and found what they found in the middle of a, I’m sure you’ll dispute this, public health emergency, so they balanced the immediate need vs. the optics hoping the President’s consistent efforts to build confidence in the public was enough for them to move forward with a vaccine when it was needed most. Efficacy is already proven, and with 65%+ uptake on the vaccine there honestly is no rush as they know as well as you and I do that their final stamp of approval isn’t going to be the one thing that changes your mind. At best it will change the decisions of 5-10% of the remaining holdouts. So they are doing what they think is best for their rather unearned current bad reputation with people that don’t trust them. Because today’s vaccine is less important than ensuring long-term confidence in public health officials.</p>

        <p>According to BioNTech's file with the SEC, Pfizer's mRNA vaccine is designated as gene therapy by the FDA. (See page 16)</p>
<p>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1776985/000156459020014536/bntx-20f_20191231.htm</p>
<p>And it is experimental by definition, since long term testing has been impossible. </p>
<p>The disadvantage of "living in the future" is that there are multiple examples of medical breakthroughs or even fairly standard drugs that wound up being harmful. Here's a list of some of the big ones: </p>
<p>https://prescriptiondrugs.procon.org/fda-approved-prescription-drugs-later-pulled-from-the-market/</p>
<p>Notice this quote from that source: "According to the FDA, a “drug is removed from the market when its risks outweigh its benefits. A drug is usually taken off the market because of safety issues with the drug that cannot be corrected, such as when it is discovered that the drug can cause serious side effects that were not known at the time of approval.” "</p>
<p>Bear in mind these drugs were actually approved by the FDA, unlike our current "medical breakthroughs".  That's the downside of swallowing whatever new product some multi billion dollar criminal organization tries to sell you under the guise of living in the future. </p>
<p>I can't speak to the FDA's delay in approving it either, except that you're probably right that they want to make sure it's safe. As of now, the vaers reports of covid vaccine injuries are off the charts compared to vaers reports of injuries from any other vaccine. </p>
<p>At this point the majority of the public would object on the grounds that anyone can report anything on vaers. However, anyone could always report anything on vaers, and the numbers now are seriously dwarfing all vaers reports numbers, ever. I don't have the current numbers, but I'm sure you can find them. Maybe that has something to do with their hesitancy to approve? But I wouldn't know, I'm just an anti science tin foil hat baseless conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>But back to my last question, how can these vaccines have gone through "the same trial length as usual", but "faster"? It's impossible for any kind of long term study to have happened.</p>

        <p>I see. </p>
<p>I’m assuming you read through the entire filing. I did, thanks for sharing. While a Securities and Exchange Commission filing would normally seem like an odd submission of evidence I can see why you shared it. It’s notable that they spend a lot of time in the filing arguing the same point I just gave you. Science doesn’t see mRNA as “Gene Therapy” because of the significantly differences in delivery and mechanisms of action. I’m sure we can agree government bureaucracies aren’t known for creating new categories to easily classify new things as quickly as they should be. BioNTech in this filing is working to convince their investors that this needs to change, why it needs to change, and let investors know they are working on that (and their argument why). </p>
<p>“Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and may cause certain side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed not to irreversibly change cell DNA.”</p>
<p>As to your second point, yes of course multiple drugs have been pulled from the market for unexpected side effects. The question you’d have to ask yourself really comes down to efficacy and risk vs. benefits. Does the FDA have exceptionally stringent requirements that will pull a drug from the market despite the numbers of affected being infinitesimal in nature? Well, yeah it sure seems like it. The first example in your link works perfectly for this. 27 years on the market, millions upon millions of patients were prescribed Accutane, 7,000 lawsuits. .000005% of the patients who took Accutane experienced a side effect. And that was enough to pull the approval. A reasonable person would say that’s reason enough to believe the FDA is well more stringent than what the average person believes would be a threshold for a “dangerous drug”. </p>
<p>VAERS - Yes, of course VAERS is a nonsense data point. Yes people could always report something to VAERS, but if you’re being honest with yourself there is no vaccine in history that has had this much public awareness, public confusion, or public negativity around it. *Note, I’m not saying there are a vast majority that view the vaccine unfavorably, but there are most certainly more people by far that have an emotional, and for many political, opinion of this vaccine vs. any other. And when that happens any public, anonymous submission system is worthless. You may as well browse Facebook for vaccine adverse effects. The data set is just as useful and just as verifiable. And yes, you’re right, the majority of the public would object on those grounds. I am the majority of the public, remember? ;)</p>
<p>To your last question, I’ve already answered that. Vaccine clinical trials find close to 99% of adverse affects in the first six months of the trial. Most regulatory submissions don’t get pushed to the front of the line. For example, let’s say I submit a clinical trial proposal to the FDA today for a new measles vaccine. There is zero rush to approve a new measles vaccine. If my company is lucky we will get approval to start clinical trials in late 2023 or 2024. Trials will last 6 months, finishing late 2024. Trial results will be submitted and we will get approval mid to late 2025 (with luck). That doesn’t mean our testing was 4 years long. It just means we sat around and waited. That’s what Operation Warp Speed was about. Cut out the waiting due to the urgent need for a vaccine. This path was clearly outlined on the DoD’s website when the President announced the creation of the project. They actually have a good looking graphic to explain it. The trial was still only six months long. It’s the in-depth review of the results and the approval that held up our hypothetical new measles vaccine for 4 years. </p>
<p>Not for nothing, but when you use terms like “criminal organization” is probably when you lose most people. Comments like that spur, whether intentionally or not, although I’m prone to believe intentionally, these mysterious “members of the general public” that you’re debating with to react the way you claim they do thanks to brainwashing. It’s a great way to argue in bad faith. You get the result you intended, by sidetracking the debate to criminality,  so you can blame the other person for falling into the trap you set. That’s why I didn’t go down the “criminal organization” road, even though that’s the most inflammatory statement in your counter-argument. </p>
<p>Next question?</p>

        <p>The point about the FDA pulling drugs is two fold: 1. They approve things they shouldn't have, and 2. They had no way of knowing the long term effects at time of approval. If you want to risk dangerous long term side effects that there's no way of knowing about, that's your prerogative. I too, sometimes live dangerously. But if you want to require everybody to take that same risk, you're a sociopath. There's literally no way of knowing, yet people like you have been programmed to ignore that fact. The vaccine could make you more susceptible to other viruses (and there is evidence to suggest it does, search for an Israeli study on vaccinated vs unvaccinated and the Delta variant, or recent studies about the inefficacy of the vaccine vs Delta), but people like you have been programmed to doubt that for no logical reason.</p>
<p>Do you have any evidence to suggest vaers is being abused? If not, I'm forced to assume it's more programming, since all of "you people" (forgive me) claim it's being abused because of political reasons, but I've never seen any evidence. The political argument doesn't make sense. Both Trump and Biden are very much in favor of the vaccine, yet people have been programmed to believe the vaccine argument is largely "trumpers" vs "nontrumpers".  Please provide evidence of vaers abuse. </p>
<p>On the trials subject, you're saying it's normal, and therefore fine, for all long term testing to be done on the public? </p>
<p>For this last point I'm combining the sec filling point with the criminal organization point to create a "why would you trust Pfizer?" Point. So in the sec filling, BioNTech is trying to convince investors that they're not like other girls. The FDA foolishly thinks mRNA technology is gene therapy, but guys, c'mon, we're not like other gene therapy. And this is how you know it's not gene therapy? It's literally a sales pitch with billions of dollars on the line, and you think it's trustworthy? Pfizer has literally been convicted of criminal activity many times, which is why I called them a criminal organization (how many lies do I have to tell to be a liar? How many crimes to be a criminal?) It's not my problem if the public has been programmed to dismiss an argument when criminal activity is mentioned. They are literally a criminal organization. Break through your programming. </p>

        <p>Again, that depends on your viewpoint. They approve things that in your words “shouldn’t have been approved”, yet when you dig a bit further it turns out the unknown effect in the Accutane example was less than 1/10 of 1%. The facts are that every single thing in your life carries some risk yet you do know them each and every day. When you model risk vs. benefit of a vaccine versus your everyday life you’re talking about comparing infinitesimal odds of harm that frankly aren’t worth batting an eye at. As to long term side effects, I’m confused exactly what you think those would be. How long should the trials be before you no longer qualify it as “experimental”? Because science doesn’t call it that. One year? Five years? Ten years? Twenty years? Should we just never approve new medication because there’s “no way of knowing”? What an odd way to go through life. </p>
<p>As to the Israeli studies you’re referencing, I’ve already seen them. And the data tells us what we knew. The vaccine maintains 94%+ efficacy against severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths although what’s new is it’s now only ~65% against mild illness. </p>
<p>As to VAERS, that’s not how that works. The onus is not on me to prove that a submission system that is both open to the public and completely anonymous, with no verification or certification system on each and every claim is false. The onus is on you to prove its 100% accurate if you’d like to use it as a data point. From a public consumption perspective it’s what we call garbage in/garbage out. It’s useless. And you know it. </p>
<p>For your trials question, I already answered that- see above. </p>
<p>As to Pfizer- Two items, you seem to selectively read the parts of my answers you want, and skip the others. This isn’t the first time I’ve had to answer the same question twice. “And this is how you know it’s not gene therapy?” Again, no, it is not gene therapy because science does not consider it gene therapy. You posted the SEC filing as a response to my explanation of that. The portion of them explaining that in the filing was only driving home the point that it’s an SEC Filing, so they explained to investors how the FDA classified it, but again they explained how and why it was misclassified. More importantly, you seem pretty firm in your stance that you don’t trust the FDA, which begs the question, why on the one thing that you agree with them on do you take that as proof of the FDA’s expertise, but only on one topic, not on any other direction, advice, or guidance? Secondly, ok fine, you have trust issues with Pfizer. I’m 100% certain you didn’t even bother to look into Pfizer before the vaccine, but whatever that is what it is. So, that begs the question, if you won’t take Pfizer because you don’t trust them, how does that rule out Moderna? Any “criminal” rulings against them? And if not, why is that part of your criteria?</p>
<p>For my last point I’ll editorialize again. You seem confused at how you end up in conversation with people who are pro-vax and they seem like, “They've been programmed about what to believe. That's why they can't answer questions or follow a logical anti vaccine argument. Their programming didn't cover that.” and I have to repeat the same thing. You tend to have a built-in instinct to deflect and distract. I agreed to a discussion in good faith and to be polite and cordial, yet you cannot seem to help yourself from personal attacks. I’m ignoring it for two reasons, one for the sake of this experiment and two it doesn’t really bother me much, but it does further cement in my mind you’re getting the reaction you claim to be getting from people because, excuse me for this, quite frankly you talk like an a-hole. People don’t stare blank faced and not follow your “logical argument” because they’re “programmed”. They don’t “follow it” because no one really wants to have a conversation with an a-hole. Take this conversation as an example. You don’t know anything about me. You have no reason to believe after the back and forth that I am either incapable of following a discussion or left stunned with no counter-arguments. You have no reason to believe that I have been “programmed” other than, and pay attention because this is important, my opinion is different than yours. So, if you go down that path by your logic you’d have to wonder this: how do you know you’re not the one programmed? I mean, by your logic anyone who is part of a group that consistently has the same talking points and beliefs must be “programmed” to believe that right? Because I’ll be honest, after 1000’s of these conversations over the past year your talking points are rather repetitive and tired. They’re fairly predictable. It’s gene therapy, Pfizer can’t be trusted, VAERS, experiment, long term effects, short clinical trials, emergency use authorization, etc. etc. I mean, these aren’t the stunning eye opening revelations you seem to think they are. The path was exactly as expected. And these are talking points repeated by OANN, Tucker, Ingraham, right wing radio, conspiracy websites, and some Republican politicians. So how do you know you didn’t end up programmed by them? These are not unique talking points you came up with on your own and I haven’t heard before, so it must be some Jason Bourne stuff. That’s the only explanation by your logic. It’s stunning hypocrisy. End of editorial, back to the questions.</p>

        <p>Lol dude. If the FDA recalls a thing, that's a pretty good sign that they think they made a mistake in approving it. You're reaching. What would be wrong with running a ten year trial? You're saying testing long term effects <em>before</em> approving something for public use is a bad idea. I wouldn't even run a new synthetic oil in my car without knowing something about the long term effects of it, and that's a car, not an irreversible medical procedure on my body. </p>
<p>Wrong Israeli study. I'm talking about one that showed fully vaccinated people are 8x more susceptible to Delta, which they would have know if they'd taken enough <em>time</em> in their trials. </p>
<p>Vaers: thanks for telling me what I know, since you know so much about me. VAerS iS GaRbaGe. Then why does it exist? You claimed vaers is full of more abuses than usual. And you think the onus is on me to prove that it's not? That's not how this works. Still waiting on any evidence at all that vaers is being abused. Or does that issue lie outside of your programming?</p>
<p>The FDA calls mRNA gene therapy. You say it's not because... Pfizer says it's not. It is in fact a type of gene therapy. I don't trust the FDA, but I trust them more than Pfizer. Is that hard for you to understand? Also, Moderna is only ten years old. Give them time. And you put quotation marks around <em>criminal</em>. Is that because you're programmed to consider Pfizer engaging in criminal activity a silly notion? This is what I mean by being programmed. I give you actual links to crimes committed by Pfizer, and you scoff and write <em>criminal</em> with quotation marks around it. Do you do that when you talk about the "criminal" activity of say, Charles Manson? </p>
<p>I deflect and distract, says you as you go on a rant deflective rant about me and my type. Lol</p>
<p>"I'm ignoring it for two reasons..." You says as you... Don't ignore it. </p>
<p>"You're an asshole" you say as you accuse me of insulting people you've never seen me talk to.</p>
<p>I've never said I'm not programmed. I'm self aware enough to know that anybody has some degree of programming. However, I know I'm not as severely programmed as people who believe like you, because I use logic to meet and dismantle bad arguments and form good arguments. Also I don't have a TV. I don't watch oann, Tucker, I don't listen to the radio, I don't know who Ingraham is, and nearly every conspiracy website is trash. You, in the other hand, just put me in a box with all that because why? Because that's how you've been programmed to deal with people who question your masters. If you're offended by hearing that you're programmed, it means you need to unprogram yourself. It doesn't mean I'm an asshole. </p>
<p>Please fuck off until you can stop calling me an asshole.</p>

        <p>I’m not calling you that, I said you talk like that. And yes, I can surmise that your common use of language in a discussion with a stranger on the internet is probably your default conversational style. And to be clear, I didn’t go on a deflective rant, I let you know why you get the responses you get. And I didn’t imply I was ignoring it completely, I implied I was ignoring it in my responses to your questions, choosing not to engage in kind with character assassination as a somehow reasonable response to a question about VAERS or Pfizer. Yet you choose those words. Repetitively. Yet you got what you wanted, a conversation that is no longer about vaccines but about me “calling you names”. I’m sure you end at that place often. Lastly, you can claim you don’t watch or listen to the specific sources I cited as examples all you want, it doesn’t change that your data and information is not yours, yet the talking points of others driven into you whether from those sources, other sources, or repeated by people here who do watch and listen to those or similar sources. </p>

        <p>Yeah, no thanks alternating caps guy. I mean, I’m the one that was soooo offended to be called “programmed”, that I helped you understand why your message isn’t resonating with people, and you interpret that as a personal attack and don’t understand the difference between, “you talk like” and “you are”. But then again you’re a super strong dude who isn’t offended so easily, except for the part where criminals was in quotes, because that obviously was a personal slight against you. And that last part where you claim I called you an asshole and told me to fuck off. But no, you’re not sensitive at all.  I’m not quite ready to diagnose you yet, but I will tell you I’m getting awful close. </p>
<p>I’ll answer your questions by asking my own. I think I’m a little overdue and this has been a bit lopsided. The last few posts you’ve been treating this like a press conference, which it is not. So I think I’ll take a random spin with questions in no particular order:</p>
<p>1- Show your cards on the Israeli study that proved 8x more susceptible to Delta. Because I’m sure I know what you’re referencing, but you’ve gone from -post 8 links- to -post no links- so I’ll save the obvious answer to that when you post the study. (Which you’ll conveniently deny).
2- I won’t go round and round with you on VaErS alternating caps guy. Instead I’ll pose a question to your ridiculous query that essentially took my words and reversed them due to not having a logical argument of your own. So we’ll do it this way. You ask - why does it exist? Why does Wikipedia exist? Do you believe everything on the internet is true? Do you believe everything on Wikipedia is true? Are there moments in time when political, emotional, and personal opinions drive more unverified editing to Wikipedia than say, a random day in June 2014? If so, why? And if not, you believe everything you read on there, right? It’s all 100% accurate, right? If I go to Wikipedia right now under mRNA and post “It is not gene therapy” do you believe it? Then why so much confidence in VAERS? Because confirmation bias perhaps?
3- You don’t trust the FDA, but you do agree with them on the things that you agree with them on? Why? 
4- When engaging in a good faith debate why do you feel the need to attack the character of the opposition? If your logical argument can stand on it’s on merits what does it matter your opinion of the other person?
5- How do you decide a person a programmed? Is it when they disagree with you?
6- Why do you believe in VAERS as a government reporting system, but not in the CDC as a government reporting system? Surely if the government had a conspiracy to commit fraud they would shut down public submissions or at the very least firewall the reporting from public view. Did they forget it exists? 
7- I don’t know how many times we can say gEnE tHeRaPy alternating caps guy. Read the journals. Scientific consensus is mRNA doesn’t meet the criteria for gene therapy. You seem to make me repeat things a lot. I gave you a clear, concise, definitive answer to that in literally the first post. You haven’t argued against the definition, you’ve only shown where other people call it that, and you like that, so you’re going with the opinion of a government agency. which is entirely against your belief system oddly enough.</p>
<p>Edit:
8- Was your argument against Moderna seriously “guilty by association wait ten years”? Why? Is that a personal opinion or a logical argument and whether you answered A or B, why?</p>

        <p>Oh, I see. So when you say, “That's why they can't answer questions or follow a logical anti vaccine argument” what you really mean is “I want people to take my argument as fact and not ask any rebuttal questions where I have to justify my opinions”.</p>

        <p>lol indeed. Apologies for the confusion random Redditor, as you can see I am not a Reddit Regular. I was unaware that on Reddit, in a complete reversal of how it works in the regular world, asking me anything meant, respond but don't ask me anything.   </p>
<p>I've answered your questions, some in fact multiple times. What happened here today is you didn't like the answers. And then when rebuttal questions were posed that forced you to justify your "evidence" or opinions you reacted as suspected. Feeling backed into a wall you decided the "logical discussion" was now over.  </p>
<p>It kinda makes you look programmed. You would figure if your answers were so right they could stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. I'll remind you once again, this is why you live a life of frustration. "wHy dOnT pEOpLE lIsTeN tO mE? WhY cAnT tHeY sEe iM rIgHt?!?!" This is why. So spend your time bemoaning "how dumb the public must be" and "how much smarter you must be than them" because you "know stuff", but can't really put your finger on it or explain it to others. It's gonna be a rough life for you out there when you don't know how to get people on your side.   </p>
<p>Enjoy your echo chamber.</p>

        <p>Lol, lol guy. Sounds to me like you figured out your problem. Ironic, don’t you think? After a barrage of questions that I’ve answered from you I decide to post eight questions and your response is “you can’t answer more than one question at a time.”, while answering zero of them. Then throw in the stereotypically requisite cOmPrEhEnSiOn “insult”. It’s a whole lotta big daddy projection right there brother. </p>
<p>Here’s a Pro Tip, dude who uses WAY to many typical interwebs phrases- Question 1 in my stream of consciousness above was “show me the Israeli study”. You failed to produce it. Question 2 was - “is Wikipedia accurate?” You failed to respond. </p>
<p>Seems to me you’re having trouble following a logical discussion. Perhaps you’re afraid of your answers. Like someone who’s been programmed, no doubt.</p>

        <p>&rt;They can't handle that you don't believe exactly what they believe, while the media convinces them they are better, more selfless and more educated than you on a daily basis.</p>
<p>IMO has been going on for 25 years in media regarding all forms of sexual expression and deeming those who do not approve as some kind of haters. It is now sped up so fast and what took 20 years to do before has now been done effectively in 12 - 18 months. Again, this is just my take on it as I support traditional values as much as possible and get very frustrated with mainstream narratives.</p>

        <p>It's scary how people parrot the same things that are spouted in the media without even thinking about it. I've had covid twice now and the second time Ive been at home with my parents and they've witnessed me have the mildest symptom you could possibly get without being asymptomatic (a tickle in the throat that made me want to cough maybe 5 times a day). They know I just had a cough the first time round too and no adverse effects afterwards. They know I'm as fit and healthy as I've ever been, exercising pretty much every day both before, during and after the infection. Yet when discussing me getting the vaccine they said I should get it because it can reduce "long covid" symptoms. If you used a semblance of logic you'd agree that that was not a relevant reason to my specific circumstances. Blind obedience to the mainstream message, regardless of whether it is actually logical really worries me and I think it's been especially prevalent regarding the vaccine. </p>
<p>Apologies this comment turned into a bit of a monologue, it's been annoying me for a while.</p>

        <p>People are just getting too passionnate about it. I'm getting vaccinated, already got my 1st shot but wasn't in a hurry. And i don't want you to die, i'm just as concerned about your health as you are about mine.</p>
<p>I don't understand many arguments against the vaccine, but i understand some. Pondering lead me to getting the shot, and lead you to not getting it, then so be it, free country and all.</p>

        <p>My marriage has really suffered. Broke down into a curse filled full blown screaming fight over the phone with my wife because she didn't want me to see my younger brother for a socially distanced, mask wearing visit while he was passing through my area. I hadn't seen him in a few years and he was driving right through our area on his way to a new job in Maine. So who knows when I might see him again.(I'm in VA) I went and saw him, but I obviously was not in the right frame of mind. My wife was in tears when I basically hung up on her. That night I seriously contemplated if I wanted to keep living. If it wasn't for my two young children, I might have ended it all. I have at least kept my job and somewhat steady work, but I feel like everything else has been lost, and my wife just doesn't see it. And when I bring up how I feel, she just dismisses me as overreacting. She still fucking wipes down groceries. She still makes our kids wear fucking masks outdoors at the park, which is huge because up until recently she wasn't even letting them go to parks. I could "man up" so to speak, but with my rage issues I've had in the past,  I sincerely worry for everyone's safety involved. And I primarily just deal with shit because of my kids. They need someone on their side right now</p>

        <p>I think when people are this far gone you have to walk on tiptoes and gently plant seeds in their heads as questions - questions are less confrontational.  You can start with...”honey...did you ever think it strange that up until Covid, you had to actually show symptoms to be labeled sick?”   Or...”isn’t it weird how statistics show 99.99% of children survive Covid but we only hear about the .001 who test positive?”
I dunno- start small.  She will object and regurgitate the same programming she’s heard for the past 2 years... but slowly her mind may permit some doubts to creep in and she may become more open to alternate views.</p>

        <p>Men are allowed to have emotions dude, the successful suicide rate for males is literally double that of women.</p>
<p>We must not put too much pressure on ourselves, if we cannot even vent and get met with your demeanour men will never start talking about why we feel so bad that we wish to die.</p>
<p>The road to improvement is to listen, accept and encourage positivity. Telling him that he is a pussy or "You won't go to heaven if you do it" etc. are literally the worst things you can do, short of yelling "do it" at the top of a building.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your reply! Just to be clear, while I may have contemplated wanting to go on or not, I would never actually kill myself. I'd rather take my frustrations out on those that drive me to even contemplate thinking such things. I wouldn't react towards my wife as I see her as a victim. I'd rather take action against those that made her and myself a victim</p>

<p>However like everything it can go too far in either direction. Still wiping down groceries? Afraid of the park? Who are these people? I get into arguments with them on Reddit even though I'm a happy mask wearer and happily vaxxed, I even go as far as N95 masks that isn't good enough for some of the real fanatics. </p>
<p>Do I care if someone doesn't wear a mask or is unvaccinated? No. It's up to you. I obviously think you're wrong but I'm vaxxed so I'm not freaking out like you're some sort of lepper. </p>
<p>I've gone on vacations, been in crowded places with plenty of unmasked people and it doesn't bother me. </p>

        <p>I appreciate your honest reply!! It's a shame that not everyone has this approach. All of this should really be about personal decisions in regard to how safe you feel and what precautions to take during a pandemic. The only thing governments should have done was say that there's this new virus going around, it has these symptoms, it transmits like this, this is who's most vulnerable, and this is how you can protect yourself. And left it at that. The second any government mandates anything, it becomes political, because people see their opposing political party as the one enforcing restrictions, and then the restrictions, no matter how common sense they might be, become bad. There's a whole lot of psychology wrapped up into it. It's not all just about freedom, or politics, or wokeness. But everyone is taking sides no matter how right or wrong their position is. I personally feel people should be responsible for their own risk assessment, and continue on with life. I'm not anti vaccine, and I believe covid is a threat for some people, but the response and fallout/damage from it has far outweighed any threat covid ever had</p>

        <p>I had a really long diatribe but then I realize that this is the internet and you don't know me so it could have come off as condescension (not at all what I want) or armchair psychology/words of wisdom. So, my two cents deal with BOTH your rage issues and your situation with your wife. </p>
<p>Speak up. Don't be self conscious about what you are feeling, just say to your wife "the groceries don't need to be wiped down" or "stop crying, I am going to see my brother/friend/whoever and it isn't the end of the world" and tell her straight up that you don't believe what she believes. Use the resources here to make your perspective more clear. If you speak up and use the facts and your words, your rage issues will go away because they are likely caused by swallowing anger at bullshit your whole life. You will be able to approach your wife without any threat of blowing up. She can have her tantrums, she can have her freak outs and you will just be calm as a wall of stone. </p>
<p>I don't know your wife. She could be just as bad as I imagine OPs husband is but, you have kids with her and that is a bit of a different story than what I know about OP. Don't be dismissive to your wife, don't be condescending and don't make her feel like her opinions are invalid but do not allow her to set the mood for the COVID shit. </p>
<p>I really hope I gave good advice and not over simplified statements that make things worse.</p>

<p>you need to dirvorce your wife and get custody of the children. damn she's a total danger to them, live for your children not your wife she's lost to the cult. find a younger &amp; better wife who doesn't believe in all this covid crap, this plandemic. now is the right time because there's plenty of time and you will need to, before later she turns you into the State for refusing to take your covid shots</p>

        <p>I think that you are making alot of connections between things to create a panic. </p>
<p>I believe lockdowns do as intended. Harsh but effective. </p>
<p>I believe companies and organizations should have the legal ability to make requirements of their staff. It's a free labor market. Go get another job. </p>
<p>I think fauci is a scapegoat for Donald trump's failures as a man. </p>
<p>I think if anti bodies were as effective as you say (they aren't) then 4 million people globally wouldn't be dead right now. </p>
<p>I also think you are taking alot of animus from your political affiliations and creating a mental web to justify your anti establishment world view. </p>
<p>China is a political foe, they may have even created covid but trying to convince people not to protect themselves while also digging into this idea of a weaponized virus has got to be some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen. Is it real or not? Is it both fake and real at the same time? Is the vaccine worse than the virus but we should still lock up fauci? Which is it? </p>
<p>You guys have got so many threads going here there's no real course of action than to gawk and bitch at the world while other people do the responsible thing. </p>
<p>When we do get back to the "new normal" you guys will only have other people to thank while you sat on your asses and bitched on the internet. </p>

        <p>If you're conflating public issuance of changing and dynamic information in the face of crisis with lying then man let me tell you about science. </p>
<p>Dr. Fauci, whom I don't know, revere, or vilify was a simple man in a complex job with a terrible boss at one point. Trump tried to shift blame and closures on him and his organization as covid restrictions and mandates became increasingly unpopular in his party. </p>
<p>Things change. All of us have never done this and we're basing information in something that happened over 100 years ago. </p>
<p>They just instated a new mask recommendation at the CDC. Do you really thing the CDC is trying to get people killed? Sure some people have had reactions to the vaccines but not enough to really be enough to prevent a few million more deaths. And globally this things still out of control. </p>
<p>If you value life and health so much take a minute to look at the numbers and yes any death is a tragedy but if a ship was sinking and you could save 100 by drowning 3. I wouldn't wanna be on of the 3 but unfortunately that's the nature of govenrnece.</p>

        <p>You do realize that them even giving people this vaccine as it stands right now is against the law? Sounds crazy but it’s true. Under EUA there must not be any other treatments available to treat the illness for them to make a new treatment (the vaccines). Well there are, they are just being banned from use which is a whole other topic of debate.</p>

        <p>It really is and if they were effective I'm sure they would be used widely and throughout hospitals and not just by a crack pot doctor with an axe to grind. I'm open for data on any of these if you have a reputable source and some case information. I used to work in public health so no witch doctors or essential oils ok!</p>

        <p>Remember, people came to the hospital and they were sent home if they were ‘decent.’ Stay home and quarantine. No meds, nothing. They come back a week later, get put on a vent and die. It angers me that these deaths could have been avoided.</p>

        <p>This looks great and hopefully gets more attention but down the line I gotta tell you. </p>
<p>Real journalism does not call for literal reader advocacy in its pieces. </p>
<p>"But more immediately, what can we do now? What will you do as a concerned citizen to get the word out? What can you do to save your fellow human beings from repeating these costly errors?"</p>
<p>This whole sites loaded with this stuff and I'm gonna have to say not a reputable source. They have no one on the ground. Taking data points from a single doctor in India which I'm sure they've never even spoken to. </p>
<p>This whole mess hasn't been absent of every vet, dentist or foot doctor having some say. Hell even the local hero Dr. Rand Paul, an optometrist, thinks he knows virology better than most. </p>
<p>The article is here say from thousands of miles away until proven regionally effective.</p>
<p>And now what do we do with this information? Use this article to rest on our laurels and continue to blame a fractured shadow government?</p>

<p>I'd be surprised if you got banned from NNN for having an opinion.  That sounds like something the other idiots would do. We welcome healthy scientific debate. </p>
<p>&rt; Lockdowns do as intended.</p>
<p>Based on what study or data?  I'm sure they work in some situations, but they don't seem to have changed the trajectory of covid-19 in any location in the world where they were implemented.  Watch videos from Ivor Cummins to learn more.</p>
<p>&rt; I believe companies and organizations should have the legal ability to make requirements of their staff. It's a free labor market. Go get another job.</p>
<p>I don't suppose you feel the same way about businesses choice to not serve people with disabilities or to not serve people based on their skin color?  There appears to be a double standard here.  Especially because covid-19 is only about 2-3x worse than the flu.  It's not nearly the death and disability sentence that some people make it out to be. </p>
<p>&rt; I think fauci is a scapegoat for Donald trump's failures as a man.  </p>
<p>What has Fauci been scapegoated for that was Trump's fault?  I feel like there's a missing link here.  Please explain. </p>
<p>&rt; I think if anti bodies were as effective as you say (they aren't) then 4 million people globally wouldn't be dead right now.  </p>
<p>I'm curious if you know that, in the United States, both cancer and heart disease have each killed more people than covid?</p>

        <p>I'm sure Ivor Cummins is a great source but his work seems to be almost entirely predicated on dietary research that also doesnt really hold up. Keto is unhealthy don't do it. I'll maintain my high bar of information from people in the field of research. Don't buy snake oil just because someone agress with you. <br>
Here's a start on studies, im sure people like to refute the WHO as theyre part of the "Plandemic" but honestly a single self starter biochemical engineer compared to a globabl team of scienteists, i dunno.   </p>

<p>and Dr. Fauci has been a target for Trump and his supportes since the day he grabbed his face in the press room. Trump saw the measures being taken in states at Faucis reccomendation were unpopular, contradictory to his own statements and has piled on him since as a way to distance himself from the nessecary measures in hoped of maintaining a political advantage. People caught wind and now hes public enemy number one. It's unhealthy to pick out an individual and put blame on them for something of this magnitude and is honestly the sign of a weak case if any.   </p>

<p>Cancer and heart disease are in some cases preventable but long term dietary choices and lifestyle choices are harder to pin down and regulate in a free society than a viral pandemic. We all die, if thats the logic then we shouldn't take any precautionary measures about anything. <br>
More people died outside of "normal" causes in the last two years than any major war or event in the last century. It's a staggering number that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around and if you wanna chalk up death as being insignificant compared to cancer and heart disease why not just get the vaccine. were all headed underground aynways.</p>

        <p>It seems like you didn't actually watch any of his presentations. There's a good reason why YouTube has not taken down his channel while so many others have been silenced.  He doesn't do anything without solid data.  Though I will admit that he's gotten a little sour about people being so dismissive of the facts. </p>
<p>He also consults with qualified specialists around the world and has some of them on his show.  I don't generally watch his fat emporer show - I just stick to the coronavirus analysis. His data often matches the published data.  Where things tend to diverge is in the interpretation. </p>
<p>For instance, in <a href="https://youtu.be/cjAyD8LoyMo">this teardown of a national news broadcast</a>, his data agrees with theirs.  But his reasoning for their interpretation being wrong is basically unshakable for anyone with any experience looking at data.</p>
<p>The only thing I wish is that he'd lose some of the attitude he's developed over the past year.</p>
<p>FYI, I spent about 15 minutes reading your link and some related links.  There's a lot of opinions there.  At least they include links to their sources.  Unfortunately it's going to take some time to dig into those details.</p>

        <p>You're right. The attitude kinda got me.  I saw a self described expert in the field on the podcast and YouTube circuit and saw someone who is trying to raise their celebrity and sell books and clicks on the back of a pandemic. I will earnestly take a look out of curiosity tho. </p>
<p>I wish the attitude could be tempered a little bit because it's hard to convince people of your data interpretation when it is coupled with what can only be perceived as predetermined bias. </p>
<p>This thing started political and it's been marred by politics this whole time. Doctors and researchers vote and there's no absence of bias and self proclaimed experts  The only thing I can think of that would help people is that of you don't want to get vaxxed then don't. If you don't trust Biden remember this started under trump and it's the "trump vaccine" and if you don't trust trump call it whatever you want. </p>
<p>But standing against all measures seems out of touch with reality. Masks, vaccines, lock down measures. No one wants this but the longer it's dragged out the longer it persists and I'm in the camp of managing loss of life to the lowest possible levels even if it comes with some personal discomfort. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the viewers here the new normal has come to pass and the genie is not going back in the bottle.</p>

        <p>I'm totally with you on his attitude.  I don't blame you in the least for judging him for it.  Just know that he didn't start off that way early last year. </p>
<p>I think we're all open to taking measures that have shown to be effective.  Unfortunately, I keep running into blind faith believers of the measures we've taken.  Let's look at the data on a time line with annotations on lockdown tactics and timing.  From that we should be able to see when the lockdown occurred and that the graph changed direction in response.</p>

<p>Again they got some attitude for sure on there but from everything I've seen, relaxing the lockdown measures even when things looked good always seed to result in an upswing. It's like instead of doing the necessary thing one properly were taking half measures and prolonging it.</p>

        <p>This graph is very interesting and does seem to show that Toronto's lockdowns had an impact.  However, it would be very helpful to overlay the typical flu season graph onto this graph to see where the differences actually happen.  Influenza and corona viruses share the same regionally defined season...so this works well for comparison. </p>
<p>This is a short 3 minute video from early on in Ivor's analysis where he covers some of the basics of viral behavior.  He's pretty level headed in this video and it's pretty representative of his early work. It will help show what I'm talking about. </p>

        <p>I don't really care for Trump, Fauci or even Biden, so I accept your evidence that Fauci has been the fall guy for Trump over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Actually, I'm always evaluating getting the vaccine - especially as new evidence comes to my attention.  </p>
<p>However, I have to say that the government partnering with big tech to employ censorship has drawn a line in the sand where I can't trust them.  The censorship is actually backfiring on them because they are losing our trust by using such totalitarian tactics.</p>
<p>Science is an open process.  Furthermore, i know enough people with degrees to know that having a degree doesn't automatically mean they are more qualified than anyone else.</p>

        <p>That's for damn sure on the degree front. </p>
<p>And the censorship thing is definitely an issue but I do see the degree of culpability of platforms increasing as information becomes the difference between life and death. </p>
<p>This sub exists and all the data on it. As do others like it so it's not a total eclipse. </p>
<p>I don't think that technology based information sharing quite reaches the threshold of falling under the protections of free speech yet. But the reach and scope of the information can be consequential and like they say you can't tell fire in a crowded theater. </p>
<p>I think that american conservatives have a bad habit of cherry picking circumstances and making grandiose accusations of rights being infringed in defense of dangerous or bad positions. If you watch Fox you would think they were getting shit down next week based on the dust they're kicking up about censorship. But they're not and their messaging persists, top rated "news" network and still have a large political presence. They're like soccer player feigning injury just to get the other guy taken down a peg. </p>
<p>Like I stated before. I took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine which does come with a blood clot warning. That's been attributed to hormonal discrepancies in some woman and related to birth control which of course should be discussed with a doctor before hand. </p>
<p>I had mild side effects for a few days and paranoia for a few more but it's been three months and no issues thus far. I maintained a light aspirin regiment in the fear of clotting but probably wasn't necessary. </p>
<p>I do believe people should make a choice but they should not make it for others and that goes both ways. But those choices should be made on personal fact based inquiry and not herd mentality and absolutes that are part of a larger political narrative. </p>
<p>I think the anti vax crowd has found a new calling in this day and age and will say and do anything to reenforce their old ideas about autism and everything that comes with it.</p>

        <p>I didn't start with the insults. Just made note that I didn't die as a result of getting vaccinated. It's not a death cult and I don't know why people here seem to make that claim every few posts. </p>
<p>Nobody forced me to participate. A post made the front page and here I am. </p>
<p>My intention was never to mock however the responses I've received to some statements are pretty out there with no substantiated evidence, just anecdotal opinion and honestly just uninformed opinion. </p>
<p>Like I told someone else. I'm gonna leave you fellers alone in here but I must say. Lumping all the precautionary measures taken by individuals and governments as one big conspiratorial "new normal" is even more asinine today than when this all started and you're only really hurting yourself and anyone you decide to speak to inorder to convince them of your position.</p>
<p>Don't get vaccinated if you have a condition.i don't really care but don't let this leak out into the real world because we all have shit to do.</p>

        <p>Not from a government standpoint. If you're boss wants you to have it and you don't then leave. Why work for someone who you disagree with on such a personal level?</p>
<p>Now if a business, theme park or any other private institution doesn't want you there because of your vaccine status that is your problem and sure you can sue and be a local celebrity but just as state rights, private property right and basically all rights go, yours are diminished on another person's property just like the right to life if you break into someone's home. </p>
<p>You present a known danger to people and by making a personal choice are putting yourself up for forfeiture of your right to what? Go to Disneyland? Go to the movies? Those aren't guaranteed in the constitution so trying to make a case that your rights are being infringed is kinda ridiculous. Consumerism is not a right. It's a privelage and a shitty one at that.</p>

        <p>Regardless if you’re right or wrong I think we can both agree on where this is all going, right? The vaccines don’t seem to be working as planned. What if they say you need a 3rd or 4th booster? What if they say you need 2 more different shots for the variants? When does it end? Are you safe with an employer or going to the movies because you got 2 jabs, or are they going to say “Sorry, now you have to get XY and Z to qualify as vaccinated”. This is a perpetual cycle that never ends.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right and sadly there isn't anyone to hold our hand through this and make sure we're being treated as fairly and as comfortably as possible. There aren't even any complimentary beverages on this flight.</p>
<p>The vaccine efficacy was estimated at six months. Booster and recursive shots were speculated from the beginning and I'm sure as an adult you're familiar with the consistency of flu shots every year. In order to compensate for mutations and dominant strains? </p>
<p>This isn't new to anyone and I dare say not part of some global scheme to render people infertile. We've been doing this since we were kids with far less deadly viruses so what's the big deal?</p>

<p>Given that Gibraltar just vaccinated most of their citizens in the last 3 months and the vast majority of new cases in their latest, largest wave are in the vaccinated, we're going to need boosters every 2 months.</p>

        <p>That's most likely 100% correct. The vaccine doesn't not prevent infection. Nothing does.</p>
<p>By design it tempers the bodies immune response to not kill you in the case of infection. </p>
<p>It's a chance not a miracle.</p>

        <p>Not to be that guy but I'd be interested in what a neuroscientist would have to say about it if they think critically. I've got a few family members that are in pharmaceutical research and they've been leery about the vaccine.. It's not promising considering one of them worked on a team related to the oxford one lol. </p>
<p>It truly sucks because I wouldn't mind taking a vaccine to help someone else, but not at the risk of my own life over something so bizarre</p>

        <p>Thanks mate, while I’d love to say I’m back to “normal” I simply would be lying. I find anger seems to help better than sadness in this situation. I spent all nov and dec sad af self pity etc. I know anger isn’t a healthy coping mechanism but it helps me get thru the work days.</p>

        <p>My parents went right out and got the vax, so did my in laws. They asked me once if I was going to get it, I said "I'm going to wait and see how it goes". Maybe a month later they asked again, I said nah probably not and that was the end of it.  Then again, we never stopped doing BBQs, family gatherings, holidays etc and somehow we all survived.

        <p>Just because you and your circle all avoided any harm doesn’t make other people’s health concerns silly or irrational. That’s such a dense thing to assert. My own Aunt died from COVID and my girl friend still has some issues months after catching it.</p>
<p>Of course this virus could have been much much more severe and apocalyptic, but the risk is far from trivial. Millions of people is enough that <em>most</em> people in the US knows someone or knows someone who knows someone that was impacted. I don’t like wearing a mask but it won’t be forever. I respect your choice I guess but calling it silly is silly.</p>

        <p>If you are a woman of childbearing age and you want to possibly have children or not have early menopause you are not only right to stand your ground but you have a moral responsibility to do so for yourself and your future. The mRNA vaccine supercharges your cells into making spike proteins that collect in The ovaries and many problems have been reported including early menopause in otherwise healthy young women.  There has been no data released on impacts of this therapy on fertility or pregnancy. If he loves you then he should respect this. Divorce is never a good thing unless it saves your life.</p>

        <p>For a so called credible source, I don’t have any other than personal anecdotes.  However, this “mainstream” article points out the high frequency of menstrual issues and hormonal problems. </p>
<p>https://abc7news.com/covid-vaccine-menstrual-cycle-clinical-trials-and-side-effects-women/10557707/</p>
<p>Bottom line is there is NO DATA so while many say there is no data indicating you should be concerned, like the last article, there is also NO DATA saying you should not be concerned from people with no skin in the game-they’ve co-opted every channel with the bias to getting the vaccine vs being cautious or waiting for data. </p>
<p>http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/cep/COVID/mRNA%20vaccine%20review%20final.pdf</p>
<p>Unless the risks of getting Covid outweigh the risks from the vaccine then it should be personal choice, especially since people who get the vaccine get infected with Covid anyway.  New cases in Iceland (90% Vax rate) are coming in at the same proportion as the Vax rate- the Vax doesn’t protect from infection, just symptoms:</p>

<p>However, anecdotally, Two women under 35 in my close network though have had to go on full hormone replacement after getting the jab - they have lost all estrogen.</p>

<p>like when teachers first started getting vaxxed and kids were back at school, several of them were getting bloody noses per day, when they never had the  before. This is on top of the stories about menstrual irregularities in the unvaxxed, so we already know something is shedding. </p>
<p>Personally, none of my younger family members got sick at all last year, and then when some of the elders got vaxxed they started getting migraines and nosebleeds</p>
<p>@insta_ashleyeverly is one of the accts that was collecting these stories. Read the highlight about shedding. I follow a few more accounts with these stories</p>
<p>Also Pfizer disclosed something about shedding in regards to contact with pregnant women in their trial documents.</p>

        <p>I have several VAERS reports of breast milk killing children who breastfeed in vaccinated mothers.  There are also the internal documents (from Pfizer I believe it was) warning of spike proteins being shredded and causing illness to those around them.  This latter scenario I am most worried about, if we bring about essentially a Marek's Disease in humans, that can easily be a civilisation changer </p>

        <p>Along the same lines- my gf got the shots and I haven't yet. I hear both sides. My mom and gf sides are pretty liberal and are vaxed. Sometimes they give me crap but I always defend my beliefs in a discussion. My dads side is super conservative. I consider myself a libertarian. I'm sorry you're going through this. The overlords know this is splitting apart families and part of their plan.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm concerned about potential unknown longterm effects of the shots like not able to conceive a child.</p>

        <p>A bad cold that still has altered the lives of people a year since they contracted it? Going on 10 months right now no smell or taste, had the worst body pain I ever felt for a week straight and had no energy to move, but yes just a bad cold. Maybe get a degree in the field before forming such a shit opinion.

<p>Vaccines don't cure disease. They prevent you from getting infected by a virus, which causes the disease. The guy said he got COVID 10 months ago, which means late 2020. This is before vaccines were available. There was no way for the vaccine to prevent him from getting SARS COV-2 and subsequently developing COVID, because he had not gotten the vaccine yet.</p>

        <p>24, BMI 19. Used to run a mile a day sub 6 and weight lift 3-5 days a week. Don't smoke, vape, and drink around once a month. Keep digging and pandering for something to support your agenda but are in over your head.

        <p>Is "everyone else" really doing it though? The media wants you to think you're alone so you succumb to peer pressure. They rarely report on the protests and if they do they play down the numbers or describe them as deranged conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>I know may people who don't want the vaccine but don't speak out about it with their friends or colleagues for fear of harassment. I don't know if we're a silent majority but we're more in numbers than many would think.</p>

<p>I don't even generally believe people are arguing in good faith when they bring up kids. It's either bad faith or they're completely innumerate.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same kind of situation, but the opposite. My wife is going to get the shot in a few months because her job is requiring it and I am going to be losing my job because I am going to refuse it. I follow the Covid/injection stuff very closely and she doesn’t care at all. She thinks Covid is over and people have “moved on.” It’s caused so much tension between us and we are on the verge of divorce. I need to be with someone who shares the same world views as me and also doesn’t want to take this poison.</p>

        <p>Because our views on what’s happening in the world and life in general are just so utterly different. Her taking the vaccine would be the nail in the coffin. She has told me that she loves being a sheep and wants to live in ignorant bliss, which is the opposite of who I am. The worst part is that she won’t hesitate to give our children the Covid shot. If a day care or school requires it she would give it to our kids without question. I never want my kids to wear masks or take these injections. Also, I think I will lose my sexual attraction to her if she takes it. Her body will
Become genetically modified and she will be a spike protein factory. I would not comfortable having sex with anyone who has taken the injections.</p>

        <p>I feel you, man. It got to the point where she told me I can’t talk to her about Covid or vaccines anymore or she would separate and we would divorce. She even left for a week twice and took my son with her. All because I was talking about Covid stuff and the vaccine. It’s like her brain can’t even comprehend what’s going on in the world. She said “If we are being depopulated I just want to be happy until I die.” She says even talking about this stuff makes her miserable. I can’t understand how someone can have such a weak mind.</p>

        <p>Exactly. There is a great divide in consciousness happening right now. The “vaccinated” sheep who believe the mainstream government narrative and suffer from Stockholm syndrome are living in their own delusional reality, and the people who are awake can see things for what they truly are.</p>

        <p>&rt;She has told me that she loves being a sheep and wants to live in ignorant bliss,</p>
<p>I understand people who think that way because its said that "to not become mad, a little bit of bliss is necessary". On the other hand I can't really stand it because that's not really who i am. So i feel you.   </p>
<p>Aftwr all, it's her choice, if she wants to do it and you dont, try to tell her its her choice and you respect it and you wish the same for her. But at the same time a couple is supposed to be kinda like a team. But maybe you can try to put some water in you wine about her choice as long as she doesnt want to imppse it on you or your kids.  </p>
<p>For the sex part honestly idk what to think about it yet, im not terrified or afraid by vaccinated people</p>

        <p>I think most most women fall in the "prefer to live in ignorant bliss' category.  Even the ones that don't like my wife only want s to know so much about what's going on in the world.  She knows the vaccines have problems and refuses to ever get it.  Women's brains are wired much different than ours.  I can sit down with buds and talk about this shit for hours but if I wake up, read a few articles and go to talk to her about them when she wakes up she just gives me that "fuck off I don't wan't to hear it" look lol.</p>

        <p>Same, man. I think it's something to do with men being the ones who are supposed to solve things like that. And yeah you should tell women about it, but not use them as some emotional crutch by talking about it all the time. Trouble is there's not much action you can take in this case, can't solve it, can only talk about it.</p>

        <p>My wife pretty much bullied me into taking the vaccine.  Nothing too bad but honestly just wanted her to stop talking about it.  I said I didn’t want to take it at least 5 times before just giving in.  Got it a few months ago and everything is fine. Just like any other vaccine, it wasn’t a big deal and life carried on.<br>
Now I carry around the vaccine card and show it to people everywhere just to annoy her.  I flash it around and act like I am a hero and saved a dozen babies from a burning building.  She rolls her eyes or gives me a bad look because she knows I am being sarcastic.  </p>
<p>I could only imagine if I was still arguing with her about it lol.  I don’t know how some of you do it.  There are definitely hills I would die on(or divorce on) but a vaccine is not on that list.  I think most people are making a huge deal out of something that isn’t.</p>

        <p>We'll see in a couple of years. My dad got it and he seems...relatively normal but I notice there is a difference. I can't put my finger on it. Oh and some weird bump formed on his neck after he got it, had to get surgery to cut it out. </p>
<p>My mom got it, said she wouldn't but I told my wife I knew she would eventually cave....I hate being right about these things. I hope the people who had no side effects got the placebo. I do worry that in 2 to 5 years we start to see people's health start to rapidly deteriorate who've gotten the shot and this will be blamed on a "new" variant.</p>

        <p>I think there is a phenomenon where after taking the vaccine, anything that happens becomes the result of the vaccine.  We have to be careful to attributing everything to the vaccine without actually knowing if it would have happened anyway like the bump on your dad’s neck.  My wife had a small bump form on her head a few years ago that got big enough to where she had it removed(I called it her devil horn).  I’d imagine that if it had occurred around the same time as the vaccine we might suspect the vaccine caused it.  </p>
<p>Health deteriorates as time passes for everyone.  The key will be trying to find out if it was the vaccine that accelerated the process.  I doubt it will considering this is just one of the dozens of vaccines people take throughout their lives.  I don’t see this vaccine as especially dangerous.  I understand the hesitation because it didn’t go through the more long term rigorous study.  At the same time we are exposed to hundreds of chemicals on a daily basis through our food and air that haven’t been fully studied.  And there are plenty that have been deemed hazardous and dangerous yet we are still exposed to on a daily basis.  </p>
<p>We get obsessed with this one issue, the covid vaccine, and forget about how unsafe the modern world is in general for our health.</p>

        <p>Ok fine, but I've never seen an injection get this much promotion, so to equate it with others is....naive to say the least. Not to mention this isn't even a vaccine by pure definition. Most vaccines also go through long term testing trials and this one was done in less than a year.</p>
<p>They said they haven't skipped any test because they say all the procedures were done simultaneously. This is the equivalent of someone trying to say the entire alphabet simultaneously, which is not possible. A leads to B leads to C but in this scenario that isn't the case, A was done along side of B along side of C and the result is muddled speech.</p>
<p>In the beginning people on this sub were saying the same thing about covid deaths since they were counted after 28 days post mortem. The only people obsessed about anything is TPTB who insist on everyone taking it, and that is a big deal. I think you're more trying to reassure yourself and not me since you've taken it. I don't have to rationalize anything since I haven't taken it and can enjoy speculating on anything regarding all this with out any repercussions.</p>

        <p>I've been getting tired of my in-laws badgering my wife. They haven't said anything to me, but I think my wife's warned them if they do, I'll just ignore them or leave. They're nice people, they're just disappointed we haven't been vaccinated. I've had covid, just once that I know of, I felt fine other than losing my taste and smell. I don't feel I need to be vaccinated, we're young, very active and very healthy. And it's not like getting the vaccine will stop you from getting it or spreading it.</p>

        <p>Dude man, I feel you on this. My husband's family are nuts. They're all "vaccinated".  Yes, they still change clothes before going in the house and wipe down their groceries. He has been getting numerous texts and emails weekly since they became available  about getting "vaccinated ". Why haven't you? What are your reasons? Guilt tripping about how he's neglecting them by not seeing them (which it's really them refusing to see him). Stressed him so much.</p>
<p>His main reason? We were trying to conceive. Currently 3 1/2 months pregnant.  I about lost it when he told his mom the news. I shit you not the first words out of her mouth were "is this why you haven't been vaccinated?" </p>
<p>I just can't even with them anymore. Any email I see from them (because I check them way more often than he does) I just delete it. Less stress for him. Seriously fuck people like this.</p>

        <p>I can relate! Same exact situation as you. My in-laws are very liberal and complete normies. Not trying to rag on them because they are fairly nice people, but they even admit themselves that they just watch mainstream media and "don't have the time" to do their own research. They are in the "at risk" age range, so I don't criticize their choice to get the vaccine at all, but they won't stop throwing little hints at my wife to get the vaccine. They know I'll just ignore them if they bug me about it, especially since we disagree on a lot politically and also regarding the Covid lockdowns etc... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What really annoys me though is that my wife has had bad reactions to vaccines before and always has the worst side effects when taking medications.... Like WHY would you want your own fucking daughter to get this experimental vaccine when she's young and healthy? These past few years have really made me dislike my in-laws... I try to not spend as much time with them because everything becomes political and geared towards their weird ass Covid cult... It's sad.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally I have no idea how some woman who is moderate right could have ever married a liberal... Classical liberal maybe but mordern liberal?! This is the very first I have ever heard of this. </p>
<p>These labels mean little to nothing about a person but a modern liberal man is such an insufferably weak demeanor... All the ones i know are literal cucks or their girlfriends big time cheat on them with their secret Chad.</p>

        <p>My bf is an enthusiastic Trump supporter and I'm a liberal from Seattle. Classical liberal, though. Absolutely despise leftist ideology. Him and I agree on a LOT of issues, it's weird. But we're also reasonable and open-minded when we disagree.</p>
<p>I think the real battle here isn't left vs right, it's everyone who can still think for themselves VS radical leftists &amp; covid cultists.</p>

        <p>Classical liberals and conservatives these days are basically the same thing. Take Jordan Peterson, for example. STRONG and extremely articulate classical liberal, labeled as alt-right. </p>
<p>Personally I could be labeled moderate conservative or classical liberal, and I think both would make sense.</p>

<p>Ive dealt with a similar thing last year and he wasn’t even full doomer, but still considered me selfish and over-exaggerating. He did nothing to comfort me when I was surrounded by a cloud of existential dread that I never could get away from. I suffered too long and too much for anyone to belittle me over valid concerns. </p>
<p>I had a dream he gave me both jabs in my arm and I starting freaking out because I thought it was real. I so was relieved when I woke up. Im so over arguing with doomers. If he won’t leave you alone about it, you need to get away from him.</p>

        <p>&rt;time means nothing</p>
<p>was the hardest pill to swallow...lost a bunch of friends ive known for 15+ years</p>
<p>i always knew the gov and powerful ppl dont give a fuck about me and rather have me sick and dropping dead as soon as im able to retire so them wanting to lock us up and force vax us all was NO suprise AT ALL... but im so so SO disappointed in so many ppl who claimed they're rebels, who always were the loudest about fuck the gov and fuck the police...now they complain about waiters not checking their vax status in the restaurant...its disgusting...IDK maybe i was too naive but i really thought more ppl value freedom and independece</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear it. My family is incredibly based.  My mother was just telling me they're going to come to a conclusion this week as to whether they'll require her to wear a mask at the office since she isn't vaccinated (she already had covid) and she's like "if the answer is anything other than, no mask I'll just quit and retire right there on the spot."  They need her way more than she needs them.</p>

        <p>“Anyway, my spouse <em>snatches my phone and starts berating my friend - he keeps asking her what's so funny.</em> <strong>yo what the fuck?</strong></p>
<p>My friend is fully-vaccinated. She says to him that she just can't believe people are actually disinviting their friends to things because of their vaccination status. She says she's heard of it happening on TV, but didn't know people were actually doing that in real life. </p>
<p>So I snatch my phone back from him, and I tell my friend I'll call her later.</p>
<p>Once I got off the phone, <em>my spouse repeatedly says to me that I lack values, I'm selfish, and I should think of his friend's toddlers.”</em> <strong>extremely manipulative</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t about Covid, this is about abusive, controlling behavior, and all sorts of red flags all over the place. This is about respect. This is about trust. This is about autonomy. Don’t belittle this problem by saying it’s about Covid, it’s not. It’s about behavior that is inexcusable under any circumstance…</p>

<p>You might not like the fact that I am not choosing the corona vaccine, but that's my choice and we all, vaccinated and unvaccinated, have to love together in the future. (Unless the plan is to exterminate the unvaccinated.)</p>

        <p>Seriously. I'm scrolling through this thread right now and just grateful I found a partner that isn't snatching my phone, screaming at me and carrying on like an asshole because her opinion doesn't line up with mine. I wrote one Covid related email to her and everything from our groceries to potential vaccination and safety precautions like reentering the house, masks etc was discussed last May. We didn't agree on everything but we listened to each other and discussed things like a team.</p>
<p>If a person cannot contend with their partner against the stresses of life as <em>partners</em> they're 100% fucked. I'd get a divorce for sure.</p>

        <p>It’s not so much a vaxx thing as it is a liberal thing. It’s always the liberals who have been brainwashed so bad that they will hound you, call you names, threaten you, hate you for not getting the vaxx, but they react exactly the same way to you for anything you don’t agree with them on. Supporting Trump, being against all the woke shit, BLM, gay &amp; transgender topics. They get so enraged if you don’t agree with the liberal agenda they wish death upon you and truly hate you. I could never be in a relationship with someone like this because I would have absolutely no respect for them.</p>

        <p>&rt;He gets really self-righteous and condescending. And if I don't just shut down and ignore him, I'll eventually get mad (because who likes being talked to like they're dumb) and then everything will go left.</p>
<p>All details aside, this would be a dealbreaker for me. If someone doesn't respect your intelligence at all, is there even a relationship?</p>
<p>Edit: To answer your question, no, I am not dealing with this because every single member of my friends and family group (99% of them vaccinated) have no problem with my being unvaccinated. Your husband's behavior is extreme and abnormal.</p>

        <p>This isn’t about the shot. This is about his urge to control and isolate you because he’s scared and entitled. You not getting the shot forces him to consider perspectives other than his own, and he can’t handle that, because it means he might be wrong. </p>
<p>He was probably always controlling in some way up until now, but you might have brushed it off or he might have been lucky enough to have always gotten his way so you may not have seen it.</p>

        <p>So sorry for what you're going through. </p>
<p>I've lost a few friends due to my views, and I'm better off for it. All of the doomer types I know genuinely believe in the propaganda.
Half of my family has had the clot shot. We don't talk about it. I respect their views, but they can't handle mine.
I'm fortunate that Mr jerk and I agree on this issue. If we didn't, I'd have to leave him. All the love in the world won't fix major disagreements.</p>

        <p>I'm a Catholic (non-practicing until the Papal pretender is thrown down) and I believe that divorce should be a final option. </p>
<p>However, I also believe that the point of a marriage isn't "love" it's to announce to the world that you are in a life-long union with another person in order to provide care, stability and love to your children. This belief implies that the both husband and wife believe in the same core values and principles, that where there are disagreements, they are often minor (even if you get loud about it). </p>
<p>I'm not going to tell you that you should "hit the Facebook, get a gym and delete a lawyer" but you should take some time to consider whether you would want to bring children into this marriage with your husband, and that you would want his values to be imparted to your children.</p>
<p>Your husband <em>is</em> in a cult. And to be honest if you choose to stay with him your next thoughts should either be of how the heck you're going to break him out of it or how you're just going to have to live a lie and pretend you agree with him and "get the shot". </p>
<p>God bless you and I wish you luck with this problem. We all go through challenges in life but one thing I know is that our struggles aren't without cause and they all happen for a reason.</p>

        <p>My friend's cousin is divorcing his wife and moving back to his parents due to extreme covid attitudes which involved not allowing him to see his own children, threatening and more.</p>
<p>For some content, currently the rules in the UK are the most relaxed they've been since the beginning and she's only just allowing their children to play outside in the garden. </p>
<p>The neighbour threw a frisbee back over the fence the other day and she shouted at him.</p>
<p>It's genuine derangement and I hope he can take the kids with him - the mental damage she will have inflicted already will be life changing. They will become agoraphobic</p>

        <p>I don’t know you, so I don’t want to get too personal, but you should really ask yourself if this is the kind of man you want raising your children (assuming you want children, maybe you dont).

        <p>I see the way people deal with this covid hysteria the way i see being unequally yoked in religious views. Both can really be a deal breaker for relationships and especially marriage to me. I am grateful and blessed to be in a relationship with a man who's as against this stuff as i am and who can see the bigger picture of this pandemic. </p>
<p>If you both can't agree to not discuss this anymore or if he can't see past this, end it imo. Marriage is supposed to be about supporting each other after all, isn't it?</p>

        <p>Since you are married I would advise to hang in a little longer. </p>
<p>BUT: Political differences can be philosophical differences. These are nearly impossible to reconcile.  If you don't have kids and want to have them in the future you should start talking.  How many kids? How important is breastfeeding? What if it completely sucks? Talk about curfews and what is acceptable when teenagers become sexually active. Public or private school if your finances allow it.</p>
<p>These are often philosophical differences that can not be reconciled and I think political ideology can predict outcomes. </p>
<p>An example.  I think a liberal man is more likely to demand his wife to breastfeed beyond her comfort than a conservative.  Body autonomy be damned.</p>
<p>I dated an ultra liberal that said she was completely fine with her 14 year old (hypothetical) children having sex in the house when she was there. That was a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>Philosophical ideology is more important than political ideology but political ideology is a good predictor of philosophical ideology. </p>
<p>Start having these conversations if you haven't yet. </p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

I hope I can make mom see the light but this is tearing families apart.</p>

        <p>Re-reading this again, OP, I've gotta agree with a lot of the posters here. Your husband sounds like he was a controlling, manipulative, semi-abusive POS to begin with and the "crisis" surrounding the 'rona just let his true colors come out.</p>
<p>But yes, to answer your question, he is in a literal, honest-to-God cult. <em>I'm</em> not going to "cut off" any family members of mine, but given my unflinching resistance and opposition to this shit (especially the experimental mRNA gene therapy) in an extended family comprised pretty much completely of Branch Covidians, it's likely inevitable at some point or another, even after my mom (apparently seriously) said "(x) people don't make family the enemy." And anyone who's read even one of my vent posts knows how much I trust her judgement lately.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't know exactly what the breaking point would or will be. I already told them that Pedo Joe, our state dictator and their minions would literally have to kill me before they put this shit in my body. Probably ceasing to mince words a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein">bout what I actually think of Her Imperial Wokness Kamala</a>, since she's apparently the second coming of Barack Hussein and venerated as such.</p>

        <p>This whole Covid thing really divided our family too. Not so much between my wife and me, more with my kids.</p>
<p>Here is my observation:</p>
<p>For some people, not all, the mRNA shots seem to be changing their personality. I know of two people, one a family member and the other an acquaintance. One is my wife's step Mom who had full-on Covid for 21 days and was sicker than a dog.</p>
<p>She is 81. What did she do when she recovered from Covid?</p>
<p>(Drum Roll Please).</p>
<p>She went right out and got the Phizer Shot, 1 and 2 - boom.</p>
<p>My take is this:</p>
<p>People believe what they believe.</p>
<p>Some will respect your right to medical privacy.</p>
<p>Others are more interested in looking good to others.</p>
<p>Hang in there!</p>
<p>PS When my oldest daughter now 32 and I am 64 bugs me about "taking the jab," I just stop communicating with her for several weeks until she stops bringing it up. Now it's worse, they are bringing the masks back and everyone who took the shot thought they would never have to wear a mask again. Wrong! Ouch. You'll be fine!</p>

<p>Set boundaries, and lines as you would hopefully do in any relationship. If he continues… I don’t know.

        <p>My girlfriend and I differed in our opinions on it, although she is the more relaxed one, and got it mostly for her job which she’s said to me. I am the anti vax zealot who posts non stop about it online. But we still love each other, that comes first and foremost. Both my parents and her parents and our families are double jabbed which is fine, I’m not excluded from any events. They all are more worried about my health than worried about their own health. </p>
<p>Your husband is insane and completely brainwashed and devoid of any critical thinking to think you need to get vaxxed to protect toddlers from covid, where they aren’t even catching it in the first place.</p>

        <p>Yep. Broke it off with my fiancé a few weeks ago. We’ve always been very different, but covid really exposed how different we think. Her getting vaxxed was kinda the nail in the coffin. I expressed to her that I didn’t think she should get the vaccine due to the fact that we wanted children and what with all the reproductive side effects that have been reported. But I said that she was her own person and obviously she could do whatever she wanted. </p>
<p>She asked me to send her some information, so I obliged and sent her probably 2 dozen or more scientific articles and other stuff and she basically read it all and said “I’ve read through your stuff and decided it’s worth the risk.” I basically called her out on it and forced to her admit that she was doing it because of social pressure rather than any kind of “weighing of the facts.” Her grandmother told her that she couldn’t come visit her anymore unless she was vaxxed, and I told her that her grandma was being incredibly selfish and deluded. If she’s vaxxed, then why should she care?</p>
<p>In the end we just ended up resenting each other. I expressed that I was unhappy, that I thought she was never, ever gonna “get it” so to speak. I’ve talked about so many things to her about the bs covid narrative over and over, and she actually agreed with a lot of it. But she still was an avid masker and got double vaxxed, I really don’t get it.</p>

        <p>Bad situation, sorry to hear. From what I read your husband isn't liberal with that state of mind. More like leftist politically-wise. Brainwashed by propaganda and social engineering. </p>
<p>Liberal people have the ability to exchange ideas and respect theirs and other's opinion, whether they agree or disagree. A true liberal will never try to force anyone to something they don't agree with. </p>
<p>Based off of what I see, you're the true liberal in the relationship because you're not trying to influence his decisions, nor you're against them. And that's a great thing. Being liberal has lost its value due to people misinterpreting it. </p>
<p>Ultimately it all comes down to an open conversation. Just tell him that you can't continue living with a person who's controlling your own decisions about your own body. Just like you didn't go against his. If nothing then at least you've spared yourself from similar future events. Everything is replaceable, except life and time. The sooner the better.</p>

        <p>Totally agree with this sentiment. People like Jordan Peterson self identify as liberal for this reason. It’s the tendency for a high degree of openness and creativity. </p>
<p>Prior to 2016, I also identified as liberal, but
Now I’m more inclined to say I’m a libertarian. Labels hold us back anyway, and people get so hung up on the liberal/conservative dichotomy. More than anything this is looking to me like it’s coming down to the free thinkers vs the conformists.</p>

        <p>Exactly my point. Liberal is often overshadowed by the way society likes to etiquette and label or by politicizing everything. Liberal is about being open to both conservative and radical ideas and views. </p>
<p>The ability to understand the limitations that our day-to-day "information" impose to our thinking process and always be open for a change if any is needed. Peterson is a great example. </p>
<p>I don't know why the negative karma on the comment. I wish my English was better so that I can express myself fully without the need to dumb down everything. Often times I find my opinions come off not the way I intend.</p>

        <p>Luckily my gf agrees with me. My dad however  is brainwashed by CNN. I am in Nevada and CNN is giving us the Florida style bodies in the street in 2 weeks treatment right now. Dad keeps sending me emails pleading with me to get the jab. All I can really tell him is that everything is fine here, but the problem is he needs to stop watching the news. He won't do that. I hope it doesn't come to the point of some kind of an ultimatum because there is no way I am getting an expiremental injection.</p>

        <p>The toddlers argument is something very popular these days. It's ridiculous! It's common knowledge that toddlers and children in general are the LEAST affected by COVID. Ever since the COVID lunacy started I haven't heard of a single child who died of the virus or was seriously ill due to it. God, the level of brainwashing is insane!</p>

        <p>Lost my best friend of 13 years, because she constantly talks about how afraid of Covid she is. I told her I don't like to live my life in fear, and in all honesty we're much more likely to die of multiple other reasons. She didn't like that answer, kept trying to tell me why I should be afraid, why it's soooo dangerous etc. Now we've stopped talking altogether, I  don't feel great about losing someone that I've been through so much with, but sometimes it's necessary to cut that negativity out of your life.</p>
<p>I'm so happy to be engaged to someone with the same beliefs as me, because I'd cut him out of my life real quick, if he acted like your husband acts towards you.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that, the conditioning is very powerful with some. Is it possible to get him to stop watching Tv / stop digesting media for some period of time, say a week or whatever? Propaganda of this level requires constant reinforcement and a bit of a break from that could help him, and subsequently you out quite a bit.</p>

        <p>It is a cult, if you are not part of it you have to get out of it. Might be difficult to leave, but stepping away is better than living in that hell for years. Life is too short for bullshit. On a positive note, it's much easier to identify someone with the same values and common sense: are you unvaxxed? No mask?</p>

        <p>I never understood how people can enter into the most intimate lifelong commitment with another person they don't essentially see eye to eye with on damn near every major philosophical/political/religious point. It just seems like it's a failed venture from the start. Maybe that's why the divorce rate is so high.</p>

        <p>I get that, but it's hard to believe this would be the first major point a couple would have a disagreement on if they've been together for several years. Unless they don't talk intimately about important topics. Which would also be a red flag for an unhealthy relationship. If one is liberal with another liberal then it might be harder to determine the differences, but anyone with a conservative world view should be able to detect a liberal attitude, and vis versa.</p>

        <p>Try not to divorce your husband.  You married him for a reason.  Sorry I don’t support the reddit hive mind that just wants everyone to get divorced always.   Stick it out.  </p>
<p>On a side note: for a long time I’ve held a theory that liberal leaning individuals are MUCH more prone to groupthink and peer pressure than conservative leaning individuals.  I think it’s just the way we are wired.  Liberals depend on this sort of public approval in a way that conservatives don’t.  Not saying we don’t have a need for approval, I just think it’s a lot more intense for liberal brains.  Basically what I’m saying is if your husbands friends didn’t care about it, neither would he.</p>
<p>Edit: Also you could just tell him the truth which is… I’ll get the vaccine after it has completed trials.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it sounds like your husband is all in on the cult. I hate to say it, but outside of a really good therapist to help you work through it, it seems divorce is likely the best option.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you are going through this. This person made a covenant with you, with God as a witness, for better, worse, sickness and health. Obviously they need to be reminded. I’m not sure how you come back from the gross lack of respect in the way you have been treated. Don’t try to argue with logic or facts. Like the 99% survivability or the fact that healthy children are hardly affected. People like that don’t need facts. They have emotions instead. Do what you feel is right for you. It seems that your partner already has a plan.</p>

        <p>Honestly the way he’s trying to cut you off from people &amp; other you like that phone call is a major abuse red flag. I know that some people aren’t themselves right now, but that doesn’t excuse this behavior. If you’ve noticed him escalating his behavior over the past year, it’s only going to escalate more.</p>

He flat out said that he agrees with censorship so long as it is suppressing ‘false’ information. I asked who gets to choose what that is, and he just totally disengaged. They live a couple hours away and they haven’t seen us, or their grandkids, in 2 years.</p>

        <p>I don't even know what to say because he sounds like a real crumb, not only picking these fights and condescending attitude, but he failed to stick up for you with his friends, grabbed your phone (really disrespectful) and spoke harshly to your friend.</p>
<p>I am always on the side of trying to work things out, and usually once it's become this bad it's necessary to bring in a professional.</p>
<p>However, I would be very careful in picking someone because they could be hung up on the particulars of vax/novax when the real issue is respect, courtesy, and lack of supportiveness. One thing I always want to feel is that my significant other is "on my side," no matter whether he agrees with me or not. </p>
<p>I've also heard that if you want a man to accept counseling, pick a male counselor. Otherwise your hubs will just feel you are ganging up on him if the counselor sides with you on anything.</p>

<p>Just no personal boundaries with them, 2 of her sisters got it and so did her parents and they just kept pushing and pushing.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you are going through that. I’ve lost several family members and a once close friend through this covid propaganda due to their self righteousness. I have a few close family members that got the vax and I am careful not to express my concerns over the side affects to them. Their body their choice, and that respect is reciprocated by them. I’ve always enjoyed a diverse group of friends with many of them coming from different political, religious and cultural backgrounds. I do find that dwindling as divisiveness progresses and it’s a shame. However, I can’t imagine that kind of berating coming from a spouse or partner. What a shame, and I’m sorry that is your life right now.</p>

        <p>It’s weeeeird. So odd that people are being this way especially when the vaccine isn’t fully protecting them. Honestly if there was zero data that this vaccine was less than perfect I’d probably be very inclined. As it stands I am neutrally inclined and the more pressure they give and the more the data shows the vaccine to be less than perfect, the more disinclined I am to getting it. Getting and staying off the grid is becoming more attractive. Hate to hear about the potential for divorce, but I don’t think marriages last these days anyway. If it’s not this issue that strains your marriage there will be others. I’m sorry if I sound pessimistic 😬</p>
<p>Good luck to you.</p>

<p>I'm single but none of my friends have even talked to me about covid. We've just been living life normally since this started. The only relative that talked to me about covid and vaccination etc was my father who ONCE pretty respectfully told me he took it and and he thinks I should take it too (using real arguments) but put emphasis on that he doesn't want to push me and I should make my own decision.</p>

<p>It probably hurts him that you aren’t taking what he perceives as necessary precautions because he cares about you.</p>

        <p>At the risk of not knowing all the facts (this is always the case, third parties are never in full possession of the facts) the person in my head that is your husband is a weak and callow man. A man who places obedience over critical thinking and his own family. I say divorce him and find a stronger man with more integrity who is capable of respecting you. The man you are married to doesn't need you. He needs his security blanket. Find a man who will need you because he will love you and a man you can respect as your husband.</p>

        <p>Before you give up on your marriage, I’d beg your partner to give you like 15 minutes (or however long) and LITERALLY create a PowerPoint presentation of evidence. Use the META THREAD post on the sidebar of this sub to easily find a ton of evidence he can’t really easily dismiss.</p>
<p>Do some research on deprogramming, Stockholm syndrome, presenting information in a non confrontational way, and make a presentation with that in mind. Maybe this is a dumb idea, but maybe it could help you. This is what I would do</p>

        <p>You’re just super childish about it. He clearly wants you to get it because he cares about your safety. And from how you talk here you don’t have a clear understanding of how the vax actually works. Seems to be a feeling based thing. The same shit you’re getting mad at him about. But you’re willing to loose your husband over this? That’s kinda childish. Have a non heated conversation about this. He’s clearly worried.</p>

        <p>I don’t want it and that’s my choice. I said in my post that I have a list of reasons (that he is aware of), but none of that ever seems to matter. Why should I just disregard my own personal feelings on vaccinating myself, just to make him happy? I’m not saying he can’t be vaccinated. I don’t care that he is. I just don’t want it for myself. I’ve tried to have “non-heated” conversations, but like I also said above he gets aggressive. He snatched my phone from me while I was on FaceTime. But I’m supposed to just succumb to his opinions and get vaccinated to make him happy, otherwise I’m the childish one? Some of you people amaze me.</p>

        <p>No one here is saying that you need to disregard your feelings. But you shouldn’t be disregarding his just because you don’t agree with him. This virus whether or not you want to admit it is a dangerous one. It killed both of my parents in a matter of months of each other. So I have to be understanding when my siblings want me to get the vax or ask if I have. I have the vax but it’s none of their Business so I don’t tell them. Talk to him again and be completely honest with him. The way you talk here you’re threatening divorce. If you’re that unhappy then just leave him. But don’t hold it above his head. </p>

        <p>Also your five friends have tested positive for covid or just think they have it? No one said that the vaccine was 100% effective. And no one said that you couldn’t get Covid if you did have the vaccine. However scientist did say that your chances of getting Covid and then dying of it we’re extremely low if had the vax.  I work in the healthcare industry. I can tell you firsthand that the people who are dying from this are not the ones that have a vaccine. Those are the facts.</p>

        <p>Divorce is never a solution. Children are gonna be impacted hard by it. 
I’d cut off family members but never my parents. It’s really hard especially with my father who told me to just do whatever I’m told to do by the system. I guess he’ll be disappointed when vaccination becomes mandatory to attend school. My mom is very supportive of my conspiracy mentality but is neutral and even sometimes against about my radical non-compliance. For example, she insists that I put a mask in the car because she’s afraid the police at the travel checkpoints will give us a fine if I don’t. She said she’ll probably just take the jab if the decision makers of this country coerce her enough. </p>
<p>A good thing would be that all my relatives expect my dad are either supportive or neutral about some of my anti-government activities even tho most of them got the 2 jabs. </p>
<p>I’m afraid I’ll be alone in my radical non-compliance during this chaotic era but at least I still have the spirit.</p>

        <p>I didn’t want to get the vaccine but ended up just getting it because I was tired of hearing my wife obsess about me getting it.  Taking the vaccine isn’t a huge risk. I even have an auto-immune disorder and didn’t have any issues.  I’m not the type to believe the hyperbole for or against the vaccine.  </p>
<p>I addressed it like anything else in our relationship.  If it is super important to her, I will do it, even if I certainly wouldn’t do it on my own.  That is what you do to make relationships work but of course it has to go both ways so no one is being taken advantage of.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day, you’ll come into contact with far more dangerous and hazardous things in your daily life than a vaccine. It is just sad that these issues have become so polarized.  It should not be an issue that leads to divorces.  If it is a one way street where he pushes you to get the vaccine but won’t do something for you when you really push him then you have a problem.</p>
