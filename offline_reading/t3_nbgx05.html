    <strong>Covid survivability rates, per the CDC, are BETTER THAN 99% for most of the population. ~95% for people aged 70+.</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;The CDC also recently released an update to their research into fatality rates associated with COVID-19. A summary of COVID-19 survival rates is shown below; the summary is one of five based on several scenarios. The CDC data and scenarios can be found here.
&rt;
&rt;COVID-19 Survival Rates</p>
<p>&rt;- Age 0-19: 99.997%
&rt;- Age 20-49: 99.98%
&rt;- Age 50-69: 99.5%
&rt;- Age 70+: 94.6%</p>

        <p>CDC is an outgrowth of Rockefeller’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">MCWA</a> and helps with cooking the books.</p>
<p>&rt;”It appeared to him (Dr. James DeMeo, Ph.D.) that <strong>the reported number of “Covid” deaths were being re-defined and subtracted from other causes of deaths; the people who died of “co-morbidities” were being shifted over into the Covid category.”</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Portraying disease as severe, whether it is or not, is admittedly done because it helps to increase vaccine uptake.</strong> Recent CDC PowerPoint presentations ^(560) reveal this tactic with influenza, and doctors have written about it regarding pertussis as well. ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<em>Publicity given to the more severe consequences of whooping cough has created a widely held perception that the disease is always severe, debilitating, and dangerous. Such a perception helps to encourage immunization, but if untrue it degrades diagnostic accuracy...</em> ^(561)</p>
<p>&rt;<em>There was the fear that this would interfere with many other forms of immunization which are far more beneficial and important to the infant. Those who expressed their disagreement with the broadcast conclusions stated that it might have the effect of increasing the incidence of death from pertussis and urged and secured publicity of opinions favoring continued use of the vaccine.</em> ^(562)”</p>
<p>&rt;*”After World War II, diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria or pneumonia no longer triggered mass fatalities in industrialized nations such as affluent America. This became a huge problem for institutions like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American epidemic authorities, as redundancy threatened. In 1949, a majority voted to eliminate the CDC completely. Instead of bowing out of a potentially very lucrative industry, the CDC went on an arduous search for viruses.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;”In the United States, vaccines are actively and incessantly promoted as the solution for all infectious diseases by such government agencies as the Center for Disease Control in Georgia, by HEW, USPHS, FDA, AMA and WHO. It is of more than passing interest that the federal agencies should be such passionate supporters of compulsory use of vaccines, and that they also should go through the "revolving door" to the big drug firms whose products they have so assiduously promoted, throughout their years of service to the public. It is these federal agents who have drafted the procedures which forced the states to enact compulsory vaccination legislation which had been drafted by the attorneys for the Medical Monopoly, to become "the law of the land." In the dim reaches of the past, when Americans were more protective of their now-vanishing freedoms, there was sporadic opposition to the threatened outrage which a dictatorial central government sought to impose on every child in the United States.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;”AIDS and SARS are ways for epidemiologists (e.g., the CDC, WHO, etc.) to secure their jobs and continued funding for their agencies. <strong>No new emerging epidemics, maybe no CDC, no WHO,</strong> so we've got an infrastructure that REQUIRES the "discovery" of new, threatening epidemics. And the media pick a new one every year. This year, it's SARS. For the past couple of years, it's been West Nile Virus. Next year it'll be something else.”</p>
<p>&rt;-Dr. Daniel H. Duffy, Sr.</p>

        <p>An excellent point. </p>
<p>Most likely this would show that COVID deaths overwhelmingly are represented by those at or beyond their life expectancy.</p>
<p>Another point 5 Governors (NY, California, NJ, Pennsylvania, and Michigan) had the worst policy in the history of public policy by placing COVID positive patients into elderly care facilities</p>
<p>Being that 22% of all US COVID deaths occured in elderly care facilities this policy could very well have driven up the infected mortality rate of the 70+ age group.</p>

        <p>Agreed. Bearing in mind you could fall off a ladder &amp; die, so long as you 'tested positive' within 28 days.. the figures are dubious at best.</p>
