    <strong>Why are they doing this to us</strong>
    <p><p>I've been a lurker on thus sub for while, and it has helped my anxiety so much knowing that I'm not alone in seeing right through this fucking pandemic garbage leadership the US and world have seen as a whole. 16-month Lockdowns, nearly-forced experimental gene therapy injections, MSM covering for any and all blunders, and it is only getting worse.</p>
<p>The one question I still wrestle with is... why? Are these people just evil? Do they just want control or power? What is their goal? Or is it a number of motivations? </p>
<p>I would honestly love to see some discussion on this and get some of your viewpoints. I am extremely open-minded and anything is fair game so hit me with that shit. </p>
<p>WHY WHY WHY are these elites fucking up everything for a 0.16% mortality rate.</p></p>

        <p>Personally I think it's to bottleneck us into accepting the great reset.  Klaus Schwab (World Economic Forum) wrote a book about it last year and basically said covid is an opportunity to usher it in.  You'll own nothing and be happy about it, that kind of crap.  Essentially global subjugation by the elites.</p>

<li>
<p>Depopulation: the powers that be feel there are too many people in the world and we need to get down to 500,000. So the shots are the main depop. method, with lockdowns leading to suicides and shutting down of surgeries and treatments leading to many people dying of medical issues. And let's not forget all the LTC homes with people just wasting away due to loneliness or dehydration. So that's the main thing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control: they want to be able to know where people are and what they are doing at all times. Shutting down pipelines creates food and supply shortages that will lead to more suicides and deaths from starvation and illness. They've been monitoring movement and Ontario closed all the public parks when the data showed that was where people were going during their free time now. They want to discourage people from meeting, talking, organizing and fighting back.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know what the end result will look like but this is what I have gathered in the past year</p>

        <p>The correct figure etched in stone is 500,000,000. 500k isnt enough to include their families and keep the infrastructure they want to keep functioning in place so they can continue thier lavish lifestyles.they want slaves, but 7 billion of them is a bit to much upkeep.</p>

        <p>I agree that there is the potential for a depopulation agenda, but there are much easier ways to achieve it. For one, just discontinue food aid, etc. to third world countries. Also, don’t allow them to immigrate to first world countries. Birth rates across the board have been dropping for decades, the issue is death rates. More people are living 30-50 years longer than they used to. The PTB are pretty vocal about unfettered immigration and substantial aid to developing countries.</p>
<p>It’s possible that they just want to get rid of a certain demographic. But this doesn’t make sense to me either because the people that follow their “guidance” most fervently are the liberal left in the first world. I think something is brewing, I’m just not sure what and I haven’t ruled out a depopulation agenda, I’m just not sure what that looks like yet.</p>

        <p>Food aid to third world countries isn’t actually meant to help the people living in them. It creates markets for western corporations by contributing to the destruction of traditional means of food production. Perhaps most importantly, it fosters the dependence that allows TPTB unfettered access to loot and plunder.</p>

        <p>As far as control, the internet was first, had to kill free speech there asap. Second was meeting in public, close the bars, close the restaurants, close the parks, or at least make the majority too afraid of an invisible enemy to even go to those places. Next will be monitoring and punishing speech in the home, monitoring is already happening thanks to technological devices.</p>

        <p>Great question.</p>
<p>I find this a useful article.</p>
<p>https://reportingforbeauty.substack.com/p/on-the-psychology-of-the-conspiracy-7ff</p>
<p>It's important to remember, a bit like terrorist groups operate in cells. So the elites operate in layers. So there's not millions of people who know the full picture guilty of such evil, in reality it's a relatively small number. 1% of 1% that we're talking about.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>A study of history and certain characters and trends shows much.</p>
<p>For some people, the game of subjugation, breaking of anothers will, power, control, the game of thrones.... Is the ultimate aphrodisiac. And as historically stated, once tasted - nothing else quite compares.</p>
<p>These elites with all this wealth and influence, able to do anything, have anything, and without proper moral code (other than do what thou will), really have no limits to what they will do to get their kicks.</p>
<p>There are also certain ideological motivations moving them.</p>
<p>They are evil. Although they may not describe themselves in such a "childish way".  In their eyes they understand how the world really works, the rules of the game.</p>
<p>In its most basic sense, they do this to us because they can, because they should "as it is the nature of things."</p>

        <p>The vax has been the end goal this whole time. You could see it in how they stirred up a lot of fear initially which everyone fell for...then the mass deaths and people dying in the street didn't happen (the vax roll out was too slow). So they had to start manipulating numbers to make us believe it was really bad. Essentially everyone that died...had died of Covid.</p>
<p>The end goal of the vax is world depopulation.</p>
<p>Are they evil? They don't think they're evil. They have a logic behind it. Save the planet. They believe that humans are destroying the planet. They've been brainwashing people to believe this long enough that people aren't too upset with their agenda.</p>
<p>"you accuse us of being genocidal...not acting is genocidal"</p>

        <p>There are many reasons that are plausible. The most likely is that this was an exercise or drill primarily. If you read the scenarios for future technology paper issued by rockerfeller in 2010 which contains the lock step section that everyone has previously talked about, the Ide was to run a drill that identified any shortcomings in the system. Things like missing science on things like face masks, lack of evidence for lock downs , the economic effects of shutdowns, psychological fall out, public breaking points etc.</p>
<p>The thing is, the elite never let a good crisis go to waste. So now we have the WEF trying to implement their agenda, transhumanism, vaccine passports, dollar collapse, destroy the western economy in favour of the east, etc.</p>
<p>The truth is that there are multiple agendas now rolling out, all with overlapping or contradictory narratives. This is the flux point. The end of pisces and the beginning of aquarius. Whether or not people believe it or not, this is the change point. It has been coming and anticipated for a long time. It will polarise, it will be the best of times and the worst of times. The rich will be richer, the poor will be poorer. The slaves will be downtrodden, the free will resist.</p>
<p>You are actually quite lucky to see something like this. I agree it can be a pain at times, but this is a big one. Sit back and enjoy the iwn show. I am.</p>

        <p>In that case you are feeding the energy that drives all of things that you have described. You have just committed murder in the room, spiritual death. Have you ever wondered why they do this stuff on a deeper level. My previous response did not go into the spiritual aspects of this ritual but it is on its face entirely ritualistic. The masks, the injections, the constant inversion. All of it is designed to break you, physically, mentally and spiritually.</p>
<p>All I was trying to say above, is that despite the best efforts of the controllers, it is possible to rise above this on a spiritual level. They can do all these things but they can not take your soul unless you offer it. I am fighting the school because my daughter has to wear a mask. But I am going to do it in a non emotional, surgical way. I will hold those at fault responsible. Because they are responsible. Self sovereignty has been forgotten. It has been replaced with self pity, learned helplessness. They are going to take away our freedoms. They are well on the way to doing it. You better know that and accept it, adapt. But do not give up, do not give up yourself, or your soul.</p>
<p>A great quote I heard recently, about when the time comes and your choices are diminished. </p>
<p>'Render to Ceasar those  things that are Ceasar's . Render to God those things that are God' s.'</p>
<p>You see, no matter what they take away, you still hold all the power, we still hold all the power.</p>

        <p>Universal socialism. One “all knowing” leadership. No elections, the Davos elites are far superior than us. They will show us how to conserve resources and think like them. They won’t follow these standards of course. I think it’s best for us. After all, if you’re rich, you are wise. /s</p>

<li>money. small businesses go bankrupt and big companies buy them for small money. also government elites and the vaccine manufacturers get so rich like never seen before.</li>
<li>power and control. restricting freedom and splitting the population in half. already happened in german which is very terrifying. it became worse than the nazi germany under Hitler's control. they literally made it impossible for unvaccinated people to continue normal and professional life and get fired from the workplaces</li>
<li>the majority of humanity is really fucking dumb as you can see. they believe everything they see read or hear on any social media platform like facebook, twitter etc where they delete and ban everyone who are against their shit experimental vaccine.</li>

        <p>I don't think it's some big conspiracy or anything. I honestly think that this virus happened and they saw a chance to control people. Never let a good crisis go to waste, you know. Once they realized everyone just complied, they kept tightening it. People who think I'm a crazy conspiracy theorist always ask me why they would do that, I and think it's for the simple reason that some people get very drunk on power.</p>

        <p>The "virus" didn't happen though, at last not in any real sense. It either doesn't exist (e.g. is simply the flu rebranded) or is much weaker than what they're making it out to be and not really a threat to anyone in decent health under the age of 70. Rather than take advantage of a viral outbreak whose effects would be so damaging that no one could deny (e.g. small pox, plague, ebola) in order to usher in "The Great Reset," they simply manufactured a crisis <em>ex nihlo</em> and gaslit everyone into believing it was the Black Death.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is highly likely is that "they" decided that this would happen years in advance. The rapid, coordinated messaging regarding "the new normal" and these "uncertain times" across over 100 countries within a matter of months is completely inorganic. The propaganda, the slogans, the roll-out of contact tracing and vaccine passports, would have taken at least a year without any sort of pre-planning and most people would have rejected it for its obvious absurdity as well as simply lost interest over time. What actually happened was a rapid narrative shift meant to shock and destabilize, to make normalcy, and thus resistance, impossible.</p>
<p>The elite certainly do take advantage of crises that they themselves did not create, but the vast majority of serious incidents (wars, terrorist attacks, economic depressions, pandemics, social upheavals etc.) are directly orchestrated by a very small group of very powerful people. Many more than the average person would think.</p>

        <p>The ultra tinfoil explanation, for anyone who wants to consider it, is based in Jewish eschatology. Prophecy states that certain events must occur before the Hebrew year 6000 (2240 on the Gregorian calendar) in order to usher in the Messiah and the Messianic Age. The Messiah may appear before the year 6000, but not after. The "agenda" of the global elites is to ensure these conditions are met before the 6000/2240 deadline, and earlier if possible.</p>

        <p>The elite are lucifarian cultists, not Jews (even though some of them claim to be Jewish). They are not trying to bring forth the Messiah. They are trying to play God. They are mocking the one true God and performing satanic rituals. Toying with our lives and causing mass suffering.</p>
