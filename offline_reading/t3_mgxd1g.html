        <p>So in short: first day in the Netherlands 2021 that has really nice weather, people logically go enjoy themselves in parks but police just decide to close it down and fine the people for "breaking covid rules".</p>

        <p>English translation: </p>
<p>In Maastricht, people who were in the sun were thrown on the ticket. The Amsterdam Vondelpark was also closed to new visitors. A walk in the Kralingse Bos in Rotterdam was strongly discouraged by the municipality. People in Utrecht were also strongly advised to leave.</p>
<p>According to a spokeswoman for the Limburg police, several people in Maastricht have been fined "for non-compliance with the corona rules." That costs 95 euros.</p>
<p>In the Spoorpark in Tilburg it was a party with a lot of loud music. It wasn't evacuated, but the doors did close. People who were already in the park were fined in some cases.</p>
<h3>Vondelpark closed</h3>
<p>Access to the Vondelpark in Amsterdam was temporarily closed again earlier on Tuesday afternoon because it would also be too busy there. The municipality asks people to go to a quieter place, keep enough distance and enjoy the weather close to home.</p>
<p><strong>The Vondelpark in Amsterdam has once again been closed to visitors.</strong></p>
<p>The government urges citizens to 'stay indoors' as much as possible: outside their own home, a maximum of 2 people are allowed to go somewhere in a group.</p>
<p>In the Blossom Park in Amsterdam, people are even queuing up. A maximum of 150 people are allowed in and then you can walk for half an hour.</p>
<p>The Museumplein in Amsterdam, where there are 'coffee drink' demonstrations every week, is also completely flooded with sun worshippers during the afternoon.</p>
