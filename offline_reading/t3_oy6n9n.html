        <p>My question is how many of us are willing to really fight this and take a stand?  Are even 20% of those who don't want the vaccine willing to fight this regardless of the personal consequences?</p>

        <p>A small minority can hold tremendous power as seen from the obvious minority of elites holding such power and control over the majority. </p>
<p>I do wonder if the minority of unvaccinated is a false minority. It would not be that much far-fetched to think that the statistics are mere numbers on a digital screen and could be manipulated to make believe the unvaccinated are a small portion of a country (any country). What if it's way more than 20% and that's why there's such massive hatred being spread covertly in media to further create this false minority? </p>
<p>We are willing to fight but when we feel too small many recoil on themselves and feel powerless. Dividing us makes fighting back that much harder. it's all up to someone/some people deciding to stand up first, for everyone else to follow.</p>

        <p>This is a copypasta from u/fearless-leg7180 he got into a conversation with me about this and i think he did some great analysis on why the data is fake. I wouldn’t post his work but he hasn’t posted in a few days and this analysis should be known.</p>
<p>I am an analyst by trade. I just ran the data using 2019 census numbers and reported populations by demographic/race.
I included children 12-17 and all adults 18+ to account for all populations available to get the vaccine.
The total population of 12+ persons in the US is roughly 234,144,465 people based on 2019 census data.
Using the linked CDC vaccination rate by race percentages, I calculated the number of people of each race that has been vaccinated. Totaling 113,386,460 people, out of a total population of around 327,240,000 people.</p>
<p>Then using the sum of all races with at least 1 vaccine calculated above (113,386,460 persons), I divided by the total population of persons in the US 12+ years old.
This yields that 35% of the US population has been vaccinated. (Total # of vaccines/Total # of persons | 113,386,460/328,240,000)
OR
This yields that 48% of the eligible population (12+ years old) has been vaccinated. (Total # of vaccines/Total # of persons 12+ | 113,386,460/234,144,465)</p>
<p>I’m working on a new table seeing if maybe they are spinning it somehow (I may have Goofed the last calculation listed above because of population percentages) just to see if I can get anywhere near that number.
Edit: data calculated.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I decided to also calculate percentages of total 12+ population by race. Once again, using 2019 census data.</p>
<p>Using the 234,144,465 12+ persons I calculated earlier, I then used census data to multiply proportionally by percentage of race in the US. This gave me the number of 12+ persons by race. Totaling 270,671,001 persons. (The census percentages of each race sum to 115.60% due to mixed race persons).</p>
<p>Treating only the eligible population as the whole population, I then performed the same calculation as my other comment. Multiplying the number of persons 12+ from each race by the CDC provided vaccinated percentages by race. This summed to 93,708,127 persons 12+ that are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Last, calculating the vaccination rate I took the Total vaccinated 12+ persons / Total 12+ persons (93,708,127/270,671,001) to get a vaccination rate of 35%.
Just for shits and giggles:</p>
<p>Summed 12+ vaccinated persons by census race distribution / Calculated 12+ persons without census multiple race adjustment: 93,708,127/234,144,465 = 40% vaccinated with one dose.</p>
<p>Shits and gigs 2.0:
Total population vaccinated (calculated above) / total 12+ persons with Census race adjustment: 113,386,460/270,671,001 = 42%
I’m out of angles to look at this. The percentages I’m calculating are fairly consistent and even with boosted/somewhat dishonest analysis I still cannot get a number close to 70%. Conclusion: it’s a sham.</p>
<p>Posted calculations above.
My last possible calculation is doing exactly what the CDC data and article title says.
Total vaccinated population as a percentage of population by race / Total ADULTS 18+ 113,386,460/209,128,094 = 54%
Still nowhere close. I’m out of ideas and ways to look at this.</p>
<p>Heres the race data he used</p>

        <p>Compliance with the UC vaccine policy was due today. At UC Berkeley, where you'd expect full compliance, there is still ~20% of faculty, students, and staff who have not complied. How much higher is that percentage is areas that aren't the liberal and woke capital of the world?</p>

        <p>Malcolm Gladwell made a pretty strong case for the "tipping point" (where a minority opinion cannot be ignored) at around 20-30%.  Currently 44% of people in the US are not vaccinated.  Don't think the government doesn't know this.  If, after all the fear and coercion, they are still left with 20-30% who adamantly resist their narrative, they will have to change.</p>
