    <strong>Has anyone been to a theme park recently?</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to go to a theme park again. But since the California Govenor hates California all the ones near me are still shut down. Can someone tell me if I should just take a fucking plane down to Flordia so i can go back to Disney World and Universal Orlando? Theme Parks are my happy place and I miss going so damn much.</p></p>

        <p>I went when they first opened Busch Gardens and Universal in June. It was nice to feel “free” after months of my state being locked down but the mask thing at the parks sucked and the lines were so long because of the distancing on the rides. At SeaWorld they were wiping down every seat and harness after the ride and it took forever so it was frustrating and the chemicals they used gave me a rash on my legs. Not sure if they’re doing that anymore or if they’ve increased their capacity per ride vehicle now that they’re more crowded. </p>
<p>We were constantly being yelled at about masks, you’d take it down to drink or catch your breath in the heat and they’d yell at you. I’ve heard it’s gotten worse at some of the parks like Disney, now they won’t even let you drink or eat while you walk around because of the mask thing, you have to stop and step away from everyone. I think I enjoyed the experience okay mostly because it was nice to get out and feel normal-ish after lockdown but it wasn’t as fun as the parks normally are by any means, and the restrictions were annoying. I have to say the water park was the best, you can’t wear masks in the pools or on the slides and they don’t make you wear them while walking around (at least back then) so it was super normal feeling, that was the best, sadly I think they’ve closed for the season mostly.</p>

        <p>I hadn't been to a park in ten years but went this year to Kennywood in Pittsburgh a couple months ago.  They said they were limiting people but you wouldn't know it.  The place was packed.  I'm all for masks and they were vigilant about that.  You would not be allowed on a ride without one.  However, the theater of having people stand on dots as the lines snaked around was pure absurdity, and not many people abided by that.  They didn't expand the line areas one bit which was surprising.  I waited about an hour each for three coasters.  The most ridiculous thing was that they did not fill up the rides.  They left seats empty which you could tell even the employees found ridiculous.</p>
