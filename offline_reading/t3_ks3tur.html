    <strong>Why we shouldn't trust them. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet (one of the world's oldest and best-known medical journals): "much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, [...] and flagrant conflicts of interest"</strong>
    <p><p>[Richard Horton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Horton_(editor)):</p>
<p>&rt; Richard Charles Horton FRCP FMedSci is editor-in-chief of The Lancet, a UK–based medical journal. He is an honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University College London, and the University of Oslo.</p>
<p>&rt; After studying medicine at the University of Birmingham, he joined the liver unit at London's Royal Free Hospital. In 1990, he became assistant editor of The Lancet and five years later become its editor-in-chief in the UK.</p>
<p>&rt; He has been a medical writer for The Observer, The Times Literary Supplement and The New York Review of Books. In 2003, he published Second Opinion: Doctors, Diseases and Decisions in Modern Medicine, a book about controversies in modern medicine. In 2005 he wrote "Doctors in society: medical professionalism in a changing world", an inquiry into the future of medical professionalism, for the Royal College of Physicians. He has served in various roles with the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>He has been editor-in-chief of The Lancet for over <strong>25 years</strong>.</p>
<p>What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet">The Lancet?</a>:</p>
<p>&rt; The Lancet is a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal. It is among the world's oldest and best-known general medical journals. It was founded in 1823 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">What does Richard Horton have to say about medical research?</a></p>
<p>&rt;  <strong>"A lot of what is published is incorrect."</strong> I'm not allowed to say who made this remark because we were asked to observe Chatham House rules. </p>
<p>&rt; The case against science is straightforward: much of the <strong>scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue</strong>. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and <strong>flagrant conflicts of interest</strong>, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? He points out conflict of interests as to why science has taken a turn towards darkness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-leadership-1907-today/robert-califf#footnote">Robert M Califf, former FDA commissioner (Obama)</a> released his <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMsb1610128/suppl_file/nejmsb1610128_disclosures.pdf">disclosure in October 2016</a>. He received grants, personal fees and equities from over 20 pharmaceutical corporations (page 8 of the disclosure).</p>
<p>How can we trust what we hear? <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-fda-exclu/exclusive-top-adviser-steps-aside-from-fda-covid-19-vaccine-reviews-over-potential-conflict-idUKKCN26E3IW">Exclusive: Top adviser steps aside from FDA COVID-19 vaccine reviews over potential conflict</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kary_Mullis">Kary Mullis, inventor of PCR</a> explains how PCR can be misused in virus testing, and why we should not use it to test for disease, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc0Kysti6Kc">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkqQIY7J0fQ">Kary Mullis on Fauci</a>: "Guys like Fauci get up there and start talking, he doesn't know anything about anything", "he should not be in a position like he is", "those guys have got a agenda", <strong>"Tony Fauci does not mind going on television in front of the people who pay his salary and lie directly into the camera"</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Dore has a great video about how <a href="https://youtu.be/Cq8iQ65p9B0?t=144">Fauci</a> is a pathalogical liar. He lied to the people. It's an eye-opening watch. The video has direct evidence of him lying about masks, lying about herd immunity numbers. It's insane.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unz.com/audio/kbarrett_ken-mccarthy-tony-fauci-is-corrupt-to-the-core/">Tony Fauci Is Corrupt to the Core</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fauci has held the same position for 37+ years</li>
<li>Out of 2 million federal employees, Fauci is one of the top 3 highest paid federal employees</li>
<li>NIH is a source of power for Fauci (explains 37+ year tenure)</li>
<li>Chris Cuomo praised and thanked Fauci for calling him every single day of the week personally (Chris is a CNN newscaster, brother of Andrew Cuomo. Think about that. Fauci calling a newscaster everyday of the week, personally.)</li>
<li>Fauci promised an AIDS vaccine in 1984, and spent half a trillion dollars on research. We still don't have one, it's 2021. AIDS funding dwarfs all other disease funding.</li>
<li>Fauci and friends got AZT reclassified, given to millions of people. Researchers believe between 200,000 and 500,000 died of AZT consumption. AZT is a carconiogen, a mutagen, a neurotoxin. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367529/">Study</a>.</li>
<li>"Cuomo also ordered nursing homes to take actively contagious patients. That went on for two months before he rescinded that one"</li>
<li>"Cuomo put out a do-not-resuscitate order, a blanket do-not-resuscitate order, in March. And he kept it running, I think, till about mid-April"</li>
</ul>
<p>Now think about it. Why would someone hold the same position for such a long amount of time? Refusal to succeed immense power and control of funds.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Grady">Christine Grady</a>, chief of the Department of Bioethics of the National Institute of Health and the head of the section on Human Subject Research. She is the person that makes decisions on what’s ethical to do with human subjects. That’s his wife. They’ve been married since 1986.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Nabarro">David Nabarro</a> whose Wikipedia has recently been completely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Nabarro&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=998702099&amp;oldid=953854357">trivialised</a> is a WHO Special Envoy for COVID-19. He says <a href="https://youtu.be/x8oH7cBxgwE?t=1514">in this video</a>:
&rt; We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus. The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources; protect your health workers who are exhausted. But by and large, we’d rather not do it.</p>
<hr>
<p>What's the take away here? The take away is that people need to start questioning things. Stop taking everything they see as fact. Why should we trust Fauci when there is evidence of corruption? Why should we trust PCR tests when the inventor has explained how they can be misused, and called Fauci a liar with an agenda? Why should we trust the FDA when they take personal fees, grants and equity in pharma companies?</p>
<p>I'll end it with this:</p>

        <p>Dr. Marcia Angell is a physician and was longtime Editor-in-Chief of the New England Medical Journal (NEMJ), considered to be one of the most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journals in the world. Angell stated,</p>
<p>“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of the New England Journal ofMedicine.”</p>
