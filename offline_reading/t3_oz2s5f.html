    <strong>9/11? Inside job. UFO's? Government hiding them from us. Bilderberg group? Run everything. Doubts of vaccine? How dare you, you fascist murderer, I trust the science</strong>
    <p><p>It is absolutely madness to me how people don't do any research outside of the narrative played out to them by MSM, even on CDC or Public Health England, places us (nutcase conspiracy theorists, anti vaxxers, racists, transphobic, murderers, far right, blah blah you get the idea) could claim are fluffing up the numbers better than Jenna Jamesons understudy. For example, CDC's own databases showing California's COVID death toll, where 6% died FROM Covid, whereas 94% died WITH Covid, yet all deaths were reported as due to Covid. The way I look at is, if a terminal cancer patient died and they found ecstasy in his system, it'd be reported he died from Cancer. If he died with Covid in his system, even if he'd outlived expectation by days, weeks, months, years even. He died from Covid.</p>
<p>I have friends who firmly believe 9/11 was an inside job and that big pharma holds back cures because continuing treatment is more profitable. Yet when it comes to COVID, the government wants to look after them and big pharma are heroes.</p>
<p>The arrogant superior look they have when they say 'I trust the science' is infuriating as I know they haven't looked into anything other than what they've been told, whereas I, the now 'dumb conspiracy loon' spend most evenings reading further into this and get more infuriated that these things aren't reported. The censorship alone should be ringing alarm bells.</p>
<p>I am not against anyone getting the shot, my whole family has, I don't want things to go wrong with it or them. Their body, their choice and my body, my choice. Once I'm 50 years old and in a more realistic danger I'll consider it. Though as I wrote I'll consider it, I had a wave of 'no you fucking won't' rush over me! Hmm  I guess we'll see what the long term effects are first</p>
<p>Anyway that's me done, I just needed somewhere to vent to like minded individuals as I have very little of them in my circle unfortunately. This current climate is mad, I wish everyone the very best in the days that are to come. We are going to be vilified hard. Just remember getting the shot isn't losing, losing is getting it when you don't want to but do because you feel pressured into doing it. Everyone BE WELL, STAY STRONG and trust your GUT INSTINCTS</p></p>

        <p>I went from "wait and see" to "fucking never" in about 2 months of research. </p>
<p>The "rare" side effects are being brushed under the rug, anyone with a dissenting opinion is silenced, and if you post anything contrary to the mainstream narrative you'll be censored. </p>
<p>It's insane, really. How something so relatively undangerous became such a monster. Media started the fire and governments poured petrol on it. With how quickly governments snatched up "emergency" powers, you'd think they knew it was coming. </p>
<p>I just made a post on what I think 6 possible end game scenarios are, and the same people that watch the TV and "trust the science" will never even contemplate these outcomes. Until it happens, then they will say "they knew all along".</p>

        <p>The vaccine instructs your body cells to produce those spike proteins. They are responsible for many adverse symptoms including blood clots (leading to amputations and/or death if you are unlucky), heart rhythm problems, mess with the monthly cycle of fertile women...</p>
<p>Blood brain barrier is a special barrier only found in the brain, that barrier makes sure most bad stuff found in the blood wont mess with brain cells. Drugs like alcohol or cigarettes or harder stuff are able to cross that barrier.</p>

        <p>Considering you are commenting in this sub, you really should read more of what is said here before commenting again. Even the most ill informed people I know are aware enough to know it's not a traditional vaccine. If we were to take a vaccine for 99.8%+ survival rate virus we'd all actually much prefer the traditional type! I can only assume you're trolling to say such misinformed statements. There have been thousands of deaths and complications from the vaccine, even deaths in the trials which got it pushed through for emergency use</p>

<p>I've had conversations with people who believe JFK was assassinated by the CIA, 9/11 was an inside job, and they never actually put a man on the moon.</p>
<p>"Oh, but you should still get your vaccine.  Just in case."</p>
<p>Everyone has gone completely bat shit crazy.</p>

        <p>I haven't been able to articulate what I've been confused by but you did it here... "I have friends who firmly believe 9/11 was an inside job and that big pharma holds back cures because continuing treatment is more profitable. Yet when it comes to COVID, the government wants to look after them and big pharma are heroes." Thank you. This is what I've experienced too.</p>
<p>Also ironic is Dems suddenly trusting DOF/CIA/FBI.... things are shifting so fast.</p>

        <p>Government admitted to UFOs recently.</p>
<p>70+ year coverup. Lives and reputations destroyed. UFO being a cultural joke. Then suddenly "oh yeah we have some on film. yeah, we can't explain it with current understanding of physics. yeah we dunno what they are, but it's not us."</p>
<p>But people still think government won't lie.</p>
