    <strong>Want to protest vaccine/mask mandates? Look to Virginia back in 2019 for an idea...</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all! So I know we've all heard about the probable return to masks and potential vaccine mandates being even closer to being reality, so what do we do to say no? We create no mandatory vaccine sanctuaries. How so?</p>
<p>Look at Virginia. In late 2019, after the state general assembly went majority democrat in an off year election, one huge point of contention was gun control. The new state democrats felt emboldened to try to pass draconian gun laws, especially an "assault weapons" and "high capacity magazine" ban both of which failed by January 2020? How? </p>
<p>The good patriots of old dominion had a move to creating 2nd amendment sanctuaries, which essentially was having counties and cities have their commisioners and law enforcement refuse to enforce any new gun laws deemed unconstitutional and send a message back to Richmond their B.S wasn't gonna fly. Some talk of less than peaceful revolution was also thrown around. We also stockpiled guns and protested at mass demonstrations and hounded our elected officials for months. After the richmond VDCL March which easily had 70k people there, the VA senate realized this bill would mean no reelection, and even mass civil unrest so they shelved the bans for the next year in which they died in committee. The people made their point clear: do not further pursue this bill unless you wish to kill your political careers. </p>
<p>Why not try that everywhere? They say it does nothing, but at least it makes a statement and knowing your local L.E is sympathetic/upholds oaths and human rights is huge. It would take away teeth for enforcement. Some other ideas include..</p>
<p>Creating No mandatory vaccine sanctuaries: any business who enforces mask/vaccine mandates in that area will be fined or shut down</p>
<p>Creating A law group/firm specifically for protecting the rights of the unvaxxed </p>
<p>Mass demonstrations/civil unrest/mass compliance and hounding officials</p>
<p>Local/state elections prioritizing human rights and the constitution. </p>
<p>Mass strikes/employees March to refuse vaccines </p>
<p>Mass petitioning and calling</p>
<p>Creating armed militias and community watch groups </p>
<p>Making your state a sanctuaries state, Missouri, Florida, and Texas all said no to both gun control and covid bullshit.</p>
<p>We have means to fight. Don't lose hope friends.</p></p>
