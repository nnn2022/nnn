    <strong>Request: What ridiculous events are more probable than dying from Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I would love to compile a list myself, but I’m currently too busy with work. Anyone out there know something you are statistically just as/more likely to experience as Covid’s .05% death rate? </p>
<p>E.g.: The average American joe is more likely to know someone with an over $10 million net worth than to die from Covid. (Because $10.5 million is the 99th percentile of American net worth, 1% of people in America have over than net worth, which is still a higher probability than dying from Covid if you catch it). </p>
<p>I was hoping someone here would be brilliant enough to know several facts like these, or maybe we could just crowd source a bunch. The point is to try and illustrate to people how unlikely dying from Covid is by means of analogy. I still have friends who believe we’re short on body bags because of Covid’s murderous rampage, so being able to put in perspective the actual likelihood of dying from the disease helps with conversation. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>The argument you made with knowing the rich people is a bit flawed as there are further limiting factors that, despite it being 1 percent of the population, make it more likely for them to move around the limited group of people.</p>
<p>But indeed I know one very rich person for my country standards and several quite rich, while knowing one, very old, member of my distant family that had died with CoVid. Had quite a bit of health conditions so I wouldn't be very fast to call it because of CoVid.</p>
