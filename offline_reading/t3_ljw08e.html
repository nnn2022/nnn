        <p>I was disgusted when there were so many news articles about food being recalled and destroyed because of bacteria and shit. It could've been washed clean or cooked clean. But no, destroyed and recalled over bacteria that healthy people don't even notice. </p>
<p>And the animal culling and milk dumping over loss of production was fucking CRIMINAL. Plenty of people could've used it. Give it away. Ship it away. Don't destroy it. I hate it here.</p>

        <p>The new world order, the communistic takeover, the great reset, 5g, etc was all a red herring.</p>
<p>You just witnessed another great wealth shift.</p>
<p>The middle class and small business owners got much poorer.  The rich and large corporations got much, much wealthier.</p>
<p>Big tech and big retail shut down their competition in the name health and made record cash.  You can't pay your rent, they just bought their third yacht.</p>
<p>That's it.  Money.  And lots of it just changed hands.</p>
<p>Amazon, walmart, microsoft, apple, sony, kellogg's, target, lowes, uber, and many others all raked in record dough.</p>

        <p>Tides are changing.  </p>
<p>Vaccines, herd immunity (from people that have already had covid), PCR test being cycled down, weather is coming back, and the pro lockdown bots on reddit have either been reprogrammed to spread hope or have just been shut down because the main subs are starting to spout no new normal rhetoric.</p>
<p>They had to do another month of gloom so everyone knew what Biden was walking into (jan-feb).  He will save us.  His 100 day mask mandate is going to be a complete suçcess.  We all predicted this 8 months ago.  Let's rock!</p>
<p>And if my prediction is wrong.   Buy a shit ton of seeds from home depot tomorrow just in case.  Start the garden.</p>

        <p>I think the federal mandate will.</p>
<p>I can't speak for the individual states.</p>
<p>My state and my county haven't had a mask mandate for almost six months now.</p>
<p>My state has also has the doomers world upside down. Everyone assumed if you closed your local economy, a la California, you'd have next to zero hospitalizations/deaths.  My state has put a giant chink in the narrative. We have theme parks, Superbowls, concerts, restaurants, and resorts all running on all gas, no brakes.</p>
<p>Florida is has the second oldest (covid preys on the old) population.  Florida is the 5th least lockdown restricted state.   Yet is still middle of the road when it comes to deaths.  Doomers saw the Superbowl and the parties.  They now want the deaths.  They aren't coming.  If Florida had 2x deaths of California right now, we'd be locked down until 2030.  </p>
<p>The biggest lockdown skeptic in the world, Ron DeSantis (he apologized to the state, and told us he made a mistake by locking us down), put his money where his mouth was.  </p>
<p>No rational person can compare california and florida and say they'd rather be in California.</p>
<p>I'm rambling, but my point is, normies are going to notice Floridaians aren't dying and are going to be pissed.</p>
<p>Masks gone by Summer nationwide.  A couple of big celebs are going to jump on no new normal side soon. Hell,. We've already got Tom Brady and Dave Chapelle.</p>
<p>Trust me.  It'll get better soon.</p>
<p>And if it doesn't, we've always got the second amendment.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the ray of hope. Florida sounds like the new Sweden these days. Things are pretty open where I am- big city in the Midwest, I’m just sick of the masks. Having an endpoint helps because it honestly feels like forever. And then they can bring them back anytime. I still can’t believe how compliant everyone is about the mask mandates.</p>

        <p>you know. what? at forst i thought as well that 5G will just be a mean to throw us into full surveillance state. </p>
<p>however, i now conclude, after some research, that it appears 5G is a fat marketing scam. </p>
<p>its great to motivate people to spend money on new phones that actually dont have benefits - regarding speed or connection stability</p>
<p>but we as consumers and even businesses will barely profit in any way. the only who will profit are the companies that sell you 5G as super cool new generation connection</p>
<p>its a marketing scam. 5g will not be implemented outside of mega cities. too many antennas required for barely any benefit, compared to 4g</p>

        <p>there are more marketing scams that fuel/fueled the surveillance state conspiracy theories and paranoia</p>
<p>e. g. campbridge analytica, that collected facebook data of 90million us americans and - with the help of psychographic ad-targeting managed to sway the 2016 elections and make trump win </p>
<p>while i believe the data collecting happened, the rest is a hoax, a scam, to make Cambridge analytica make look like a powerful enterprise and lure international big customers. psychographics and targeted ads did not really happen</p>

        <p>I remember reading a while back when this all started that this was a trial for the real deal in 2030. And that the virus would leave as quickly as it came. I don’t know what I believe anymore but I just can’t wrap my head around the pandemic being completely organic with the government looking out for everyone’s best interest. I don’t know if it was planned but nevertheless the rich people in charge are definitely taking advantage (big box stores being allowed to stay open while small businesses close, etc.) I hate politics and believe both sides are being used to create a divisive population. I’m so tired of worrying about the next bad thing to happen after everything we’ve already gone through.</p>
