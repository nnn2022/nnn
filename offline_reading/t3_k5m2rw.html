    <strong>According to professor Dolores Cahill, next on the agenda : (1) a bomb in Rotterdam that will cut the food supply, (2) Cutting electricity &amp; Internet, (3) Martial law &amp; (4) new pandemics, involving the plague and possibly ebola --- Where does she get this from?</strong>
    <p><p>When listening to <a href="https://odysee.com/@ComputingForever:9/dolores-cahill-speech-at-irish-freedom-rally:9">professor Cahill's speech during the Dublin Freedom rally</a>, my attention was drawn to the following statements :</p>
<p>&rt;You know, they are calling it a Dark Winter. And if I were you, I would stock in food... because the plan is to have a bomb in Rotterdam that will cut the food supply. Their plan is to cut electricity and the Internet and the ATM machines... and to put in martial law; that's to say you can't actually leave your house and cut off the electricity. But once you know the plan, it's not so scary.</p>
<p>I can't say I agree that being cut off from food, electricity AND the Internet isn't scary... but anyway..</p>
<p>Shortly after that, she said this :</p>
<p>&rt;The other pandemics they have coming, is around the plague... which is botulism... and wypestis... and maybe ebola</p>
<p>Where does she get this from?</p>
<p>What are her sources?</p>
<p>Do you know of any other sources that made the same claims?!</p></p>

        <p>Hope for the best. Plan for the worst. Right now is a time to be planning for the worst, my friend. If this entire year taught me anything, it is that this pressure will continue to ratchet up until they can justifiably usher in a new economic system. It doesn’t end with the vaccines. It simply continues until they have a facade of reason to complete this economic transition. They will make the globe starve before they give this up. Plan accordingly. And if it doesn’t go down like that, well lucky us.</p>

<p>Any idea why this topic is being censored?</p>
<p>I posted it yesterday, only to notice it got removed by moderation... without being informed about it. So I deleted it and posted it again... only to see it's been removed by moderation again.</p>
<p>I can't imagine this breaking any rules. So WTF is going on here?</p>

<p>This is /r/NoNewNormal, though. This sub always came off as censorship-free... at least with regards to topic critical of lockdowns, masks or any other aspect of "the new normal".</p>
<p>But then again, since they didn't even notify me, God knows how many of my topics may have been deleted without me even noticing it?!</p>

        <p>&rt;This is why I've become somewhat of a prepper lately.</p>
<p>I try to have at least a month's supply of pasta, canned food and other food that lasts long enough in storage.</p>
<p>Even if we won't ever need it... It's better to be prepared and not need it than to need it and not be prepared.</p>
<p>Not sure what else i can do besides storing enough food. Maybe some extra water, just in case the water supply is cut off as well?</p>

        <p>Definitely will have to get more water.</p>
<p>Not sure about the gasoline thing. Where I currently live, we do have our own tank for heating, so we shouldn't end up in the cold... at least not initially.</p>
<p>And I could last some time without electricity if necessary. Unlike lack of food, water or heat, a lack of electricity won't kill me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I sent a message to the mods to check why this topic was censored. So far no response...</p>

        <p>Likely it's assumptions but lots of us are making the same assumptions backed up not by facts, to be clear, as those are not available, but by watching this play out, listening to their words, and knowing that they know where to hit people to hurt the worst.</p>

        <p>Why would anyone assume there will be a bomb in Rotterdam?</p>
<p>That's a pretty precise statement to just pull out of thing air... and pretty far removed from anything what we've been experiencing so far.</p>
<p>The other statements may just be deductions based on eg. statements made by Schwab &amp; Gates... which I still consider a bit too specific for that;.. but that is a plausible scenario.</p>
<p>But the bomb in Rotterdam? I honestly don't see how you can deduct that specific claim from any of the data I've seen so far...</p>
