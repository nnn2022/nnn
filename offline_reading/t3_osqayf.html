    <strong>What the hell are we going to do? Thoughts on vaccine passports in the UK.</strong>
    <p><p>CAUTION: Long, rambling and replete with reverse doomerism. Please try not to let this spoil your mood. </p>
<p>The power-creep towards a two-tier society is almost complete. Once again, coercive measures have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/oslxvq/uk_vaccine_passports_plan_railroaded_through/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">railroaded</a> through without due scrutiny or a parliamentary vote, just before a parliamentary recess. Once again, parliamentary process is being ignored and nobody cares. Our government still has two months’ worth of emergency powers to do whatever the hell they want with. Parliamentary opposition is at best slim and at worst nonexistent. </p>
<p>I don’t want to have the vaccine, at least not at this time. I don’t think it’s very safe or effective and I have no good reason to trust the people who are saying that it is. I know that the chances of me experiencing serious adverse reactions are very slim but that is not the point; they have been widely observed and so it should not be mandated that people take it. </p>
<p>This will not stop with two injections. It has much more to do with control than health. People who think this is the last they’ve seen of authoritarian policy once they’ve had two jabs are kidding themselves. Once the health pass is established, it can be used to coerce any procedure or even behaviour. </p>
<p>The slippery slope argument is patently not a rhetorical fallacy. We are on the cusp of mandatory vaccinations when it all started with a plea to stay at home for three weeks. We were doomed as soon as we accepted that this was proportionate and I regret to say that I was one of them. I’m a proud Englishman and I only wanted to help. I never could have imagined what it would lead to in only eighteen months. The next logical destination of the slippery slope is Chinese-style social credit systems, followed by the Great Reset.</p>
<p>While I was sceptical of lockdowns and restrictions as early as September last year, I thought initially when the vaccine was announced that that would be where my views diverged from the NoNewNormal hive mind. I remained interested in what the side-effects of using it on the whole adult population would be. By the time my turn came around I’d seen how much censorship, dishonesty and manipulation of the truth had been effected and I found I no longer wanted to get it.</p>
<p>Last night I was listening to a discussion of vaccine passports on Business Matters on Radio 4. A contributor from Pakistan was defending her country’s decision to shut off access of unvaccinated people to their mobile phone networks. It was met with barely any pushback and no meaningful discussion from either the host or the other contributors to the programme.</p>
<p>“Freedom Day” in the UK has been a total joke. It’s confirmed to me my worst fears about how people feel about what is going on, fears that I had hardly entertained, but the truth is that this country does not want to be free again. In the main, they genuinely think wearing a surgical mask to the supermarket, obsessive hygiene theatre and lashings of hand sanitiser is helpful. I really thought people were only acting in this way to fit in and keep up appearances. They will provide no pushback as the frog continues to boil. </p>
<p>It seems to me now that it is a matter of time before I am unable to work without showing proof of vaccination. I work for an events company and sites are already demanding to see negative LFT tests before we are allowed to work there. There is no legal limit as far as I can see as to where vaccine passports can and cannot be requested and I think soon I may not be able to work at a number of sites.</p>
<p>I’m struggling to see how I’m going to avoid taking the vaccine for much longer. Extreme coercion is a terrible reason to submit to an elective medical procedure and I’m sure it won’t be long until the extant vaccine passport infrastructure is used in a more cynical manner. It also demonstrates to the powers that be that the way to get what they want is by acting as a dictatorship. I reiterate that I know that my chances of ill effects from the vaccine are slim, but it is not the point. I don’t want to get it and if I did, it would be a submission to tyranny. </p>
<p>With all this in mind, what are we going to do about it? Unfortunately, I’m running out of ideas. Soon I worry that there will be nowhere to run or hide. Our protests have been brilliant but they have been deliberately ignored. I’m worried that it won’t be long before someone snaps and commits an act of violent terrorism, which will only smear our cause further and provide an excuse for yet more coercive measures such that what I’ve just written could get me arrested. </p>
<p>Questions:
1. How can I continue to avoid getting the vaccine?
2. How do we stop this?
3. What hope is there of making anyone realise what’s really going on?</p></p>

<p>This has been a shock to me, too.  I went to the supermarket last week, imagining that I'd see loads of unmasked faces --- but I was wrong.  They really do believe this nonsense.</p>

        <p>I don't think we can stop it because plans have been in place for a long time.  I don't think they just collectively say in a meeting and decided a month ago that we need passports.  They've apparently had the patents and have been working on this thing for decades.  This is part of the plan. It's also more fearmongering to keep us separated and afraid. To drive us to panic, so much so that we will cave.  If the left can panic over not wanting to get the virus,  the right can panic about not wanting our rights taken away so we think we will be cornered. But do you think they will mandate this for every single person alive,  including the whistle-blowers that revealed the truth.  I'm not sure what we're going to do. I think it's best to keep fighting,  gather as much resources and evidence as possible to win this fight,  and also look at this for what it really is,  they're trying to put fear and pressure on us. Even if we aren't fooled by their lies.</p>

        <p>im thinking we should try to make an island, i am trying to gather people to help, so we can get out of this hell, because its on track to be awful, and then we could evade without being pushed to the bottom of society, instead we could create our own society, i think its the only way out without being deprived of our rights, and quite possibly our livelihoods, and lives</p>

<p>If you aren't vaccinated the virus will dublicate at a far quicker rate which leads to you being more infectious and gives the virus the possibility to mutate. Public health hazard stands. You guys can cry and cry all you want. Reality will just hand you straight Fuck yous</p>
