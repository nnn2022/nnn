    <strong>Turn out the lights, the party’s over - what to do now?</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m starting to reconcile with the fact that this will be the new, permanent normal. There will be no revolution, the tyranny will continue to get worse, &amp; the vast majority of the population will continue to get brainwashed deeper &amp; deeper. Because of this, I will probably never see anyone outside of my immediate family face to face again. I tried to set up a date with a girl, but she said “COVID, don’t wanna do it.” Ive tried to set up hangouts with friends, but they’ve cited COVID too as a reason they don’t want to hang with me.</p>
<p>I will probably never experience being kissed, let alone being truly intimate, with a girl that I love, &amp; I will never experience being able to travel internationally, go to a concert, or just having crazy adventures in general. I will never again be able to know what it’s like to have a ride or die friend, to work out in a gym with other driven dudes, or even to go into an office. I will never again be able to see a smile. I will never experience what it’s like to be truly free to express or even think for myself, due to cancel culture &amp; the fact that the elites are probably using mind control through EMP’s on us already. I will never know true independence &amp; freedom as an adult (im 24 now). As soon as my Reddit account is linked to my IRL identity, I will probably be disowned &amp; exiled, if not outright executed, as part of a “Cultural Revolution.” I’m truly coming to terms with what we have lost &amp; will never get back. I fear that 2021 might be my final year alive, &amp; it won’t be because of mental health woes.</p>
<p>And it’s not just me: I have friends who were former club promoters &amp; high status guys saying it’s impossible to get laid, certified people in my circles saying it’s impossible to get a job. We can’t actually do shit about the elites raping us up the ass &amp; torturing us - metaphorically &amp; literally, in every sense of the world. Those who try to stand up get literally cancelled from life.</p>
<p>The party’s over. Everything I hoped for before lockdowns is NEVER coming back. And if I’m going to not go crazy, I’ve figured out that I have to learn to work through my grief &amp; come to a point where I can accept that &amp; find a new way to be happy. I will probably go crazy A LOT during this time &amp; be overwhelmed by my emotions, which will lead to some disturbing &amp; dark feelings.</p>
<p>How can I simultaneously prepare for what’s coming while having the emotional strength to manage my grief? How can I hold out knowing that all I have to look forward to is a brutish, brutal life in every sense, devoid of not just luxury, but also fun, intimacy, love, collaboration, &amp; fulfillment? How can I find fulfillment &amp; happiness in a world that seeks to make me as miserable as possible at every turn for its own sadistic pleasure? How do I survive in this new world?</p>
<p>I mean, if this is permanent, all the self improvement &amp; happiness activities I’ve been doing essentially become pointless (meditation, lifting weights, writing a book, practicing computer programming, etc.), &amp; I may have to pivot entirely towards practicing survival skills. I don’t want to live a life like that, or even the one we live now; it is dull &amp; monotonous with seemingly no joy.</p></p>

        <p>What i think will happen is the reverse of what happened 25 years ago when people first went "online" when this is over..there will be parties, and face to face interaction will be cherished and revered.  There will be art and music festivals will come into fashion again and there will be large gatherings in a few years.  The roaring 20's is on its way.  So you better hang in there and hold on to your hat.</p>

        <p>That sounds wonderful. But wouldn’t you agree that this will end once mainstream and social media tell people it’s over? And I’m worried that day will never come. Unfortunately panicked people are far too profitable.</p>

        <p>Try to get through the rest of the day and do things that benefit you and will help you have the future you want. We can't predict the future, so for all we know this pandemic will be over this year. Don't expect the absolute worst when you don't know what's going to happen. Do things for yourself that will make you feel better tomorrow like working on a project you've been putting off, cleaning your room, doing laundry. Those are things I do to make my future self happy. Also, go outside everyday even if it's just for 5 minutes. There are a lot of people who feel the same way you do, hang in there</p>

        <p>What’s crazy is that I’ve been focusing on things that will make me feel better tomorrow so consistently over the last 9-10 months or so that it’s basically become my new baseline. Like, “I take this shit for granted” baseline.</p>
<p>Maybe I just need to appreciate those things a little more.</p>

        <p>Everything you're doing is helping you become a better person though. When you do meet new people and have experiences (you will, this isn't the end of humanity), you'll be glad you kept yourself mentally and physically strong. If I focused on the opportunities the lockdowns have taken from me, I'd just be depressed and unmotivated and then I'd be mad at myself for not having tried. You will get through this, and when the lockdowns lift, you can break up the monotony by going on a trip or doing something exciting. Look forward to when this is all over</p>

        <p>Here's my take. One of these days I'll sit down and write more about it, but for now, as concisely as possible:</p>
<p>That things have gotten so bad, so quickly, is not an accident. Society had been designed in this direction for a very long time - they've only just 'pulled the trigger' to finalize things in a hurry. If they (the would-be totalitarians) win, well, they win. They were always going to push things in this direction, until they got close enough to make the final leap.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: <strong>they might not succeed</strong>. This whole thing could blow up in their faces, and fragment society along all kinds of unforeseen fault lines, into something spectacularly, WILDLY fucking different than what life was like in 2019. There is <strong>no guarantee</strong> that this final, evil gamble pays off for them. Yes, they did everything in their power to set up a clear victory. They have nearly total control of the mass media, education, the online world. But that's still not 100%. LIFE still exists, pulsing, beating, no matter how well-designed the cage. It can ooze through the bars, overtop the dam, whatever metaphor you like.</p>
<p>There's a phrase that I ripped off and slightly modified from a spiritual book: "Their plans may be fool-proof, but they aren't GOD-proof". For 'God' I would replace with 'LIFE' because I don't believe a Judeo-Christian deity is going to swoop down and save us. As the Jurassic Park character says, "Life, uh, finds a way." ANY NUMBER of things could go wrong, and foil their plans for complete domination of the human spirit. Those little cracks will be our way out. Every last one of us is 'vibrating' in our own EFFORTLESSLY LIFE AFFIRMING, idiosyncratic way, and those vibrations ripple out from even our locked down, isolated situations, out into the world around us (and online, too). All the emotion we're feeling now, this goddamned frustration, isn't just lost to the ethers. It's building up, crescendoing, linking us up to other humans visibly and invisibly, in unexpected ways. We are being pulled away from all known connections - friends, family, work, school, whatever - and wired up with new, like-minded humans across the globe. People we NEVER would have had any reason to seriously connect with. That alone is weird and cool.</p>
<p>I actually agree with them, that the old way of things isn't coming back - ever. But that doesn't mean we have to accept even a little of their pre-defined blueprint of our future. Let's make it a future we actually want to live in. Let's start by giving a middle finger to wage slavery, and mass media control, and having to obey the corrupt, lobbyist-dictated laws of millionaire asshole politicians who live 2000 miles away. How about just fuck all that forevermore? </p>
<p>Lockdowns will just wash away with the flood, like so many other corruptions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Point being, don't romanticize too much what life was like pre-COVID. Those of us who are old enough to remember, know that it's been utter crap for a long time, and getting worse all the time. You're young, so you don't know fully what we've lost of human connection over the last few decades - especially with all the electronic devices, social media, etc mediating human relationships. This is like some crazy ghost reality now, where people are dealing primarily with online apparitions of each other - not the real thing. Even before all this, real life was becoming a secondary shadow of the online world. If it takes something like mass lockdowns for people to wake up to everything they've lost over the last 25+ years, so be it. We need all kinds of overlapping awakenings to fashion this world into something worth living in. Life before 2020 was 'Individualism 1.0' (and degrading rapidly, heading for extinction). We need Individualism 2.0. Make 2019 look like the fucking Borg reality it really was.</p>
<p><strong>2020 was the prologue. What will Chapter 1 be?</strong></p>

        <p>Instead of my usual reply. I'll tell you something else. My best friend is 35, he made tons of money last year, had multiple girlfriends, rents a big house and owns a big car. He doesn't believe anything from the MSM. He just ignores it all and carries on enjoying his life.</p>

        <p>Even if that’s the case, your best friend probably had momentum going into lockdowns that allowed him to do stuff like that. I have none of that &amp; need to build momentum on my own.</p>

        <p>That's true but the point is, ultimately, you're still in control of your life. I've been really depressed all year too but knowing people like him gives me the incentive to switch things around.</p>

        <p>I guess you guys would call me one of the doomers, but the country im in eradicated the virus in april through strict lockdowns. </p>
<p>The virus recently made its way back in through illegal immigration, but for the majority of 2020 things were pretty much back to 2019 normal. Bars, nightclubs, there were even a couple big music festivals.</p>
<p>We are going back into lockdown, just wanted to reassure you that things will go back to normal eventually.</p>
