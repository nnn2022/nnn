        <p>Thalidomide was bad, but this time we have every reason to be suspicious of the motivations of those pushing the vax agenda, and it's clearly not just a profit motive.</p>

        <p>Yup, seems it‚Äôs eugenics and a Pharma protection racket.  </p>
<p>It‚Äôs like when they knew about the dangers of SV40 for a few years, and continued injecting millions with contaminated Salk polio vaccines
anyhow.</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùFew back then grasped that these vaccines might also be a huge, inadvertent, uncontrolled experiment in interspecies viral transmission. But <strong>from 1955 to 1963,</strong> according to a 1976 US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, <strong>98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40‚Äîa monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>‚ÄùBy 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses. Such contamination often spoiled cultures, including those of an NIH researcher named Bernice Eddy, who worked on vaccine safety.‚Äù</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùAs of 2003, SV40 had been <strong>found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that the rates of <strong>SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine,</strong> including the UK, USA, and Italy.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Thalidomide first entered the German market in 1957 as an over-the-counter remedy, based on the maker‚Äôs safety claims. They advertised their product as ‚Äúcompletely safe‚Äù for everyone, including mother and child, ‚Äúeven during pregnancy,‚Äù as its developers ‚Äúcould not find a dose high enough to kill a rat.‚Äù By 1960, thalidomide was marketed in 46 countries, with sales nearly matching those of aspirin.</p>
<p>Around this time, Australian obstetrician Dr. William McBride discovered that the drug also alleviated morning sickness. He started recommending this off-label use of the drug to his pregnant patients, setting a worldwide trend. Prescribing drugs for off-label purposes, or purposes other than those for which the drug was approved, is still a common practice in many countries today, including the U.S. In many cases, these off-label prescriptions are very effective, such as prescribing depression medication to treat chronic pain.</p>
<p>However, this practice can also lead to a more prevalent occurrence of unanticipated, and often serious, adverse drug reactions. In 1961, McBride began to associate this so-called harmless compound with severe birth defects in the babies he delivered. The drug interfered with the babies' normal development, causing many of them to be born with phocomelia, resulting in shortened, absent, or flipper-like limbs. A German newspaper soon reported 161 babies were adversely affected by thalidomide, leading the makers of the drug‚Äîwho had ignored reports of the birth defects associated with the it‚Äîto finally stop distribution within Germany. Other countries followed suit and, by March of 1962, the drug was banned in most countries where it was previously sold.</p>
<p>In July of 1962, president John F. Kennedy and the American press began praising their heroine, FDA inspector Frances Kelsey, who prevented the drug‚Äôs approval within the United States despite pressure from the pharmaceutical company and FDA supervisors. Kelsey felt the application for thalidomide contained incomplete and insufficient data on its safety and effectiveness. Among her concerns was the lack of data indicating whether the drug could cross the placenta, which provides nourishment to a developing fetus.</p>
<p>She was also concerned that there were not yet any results available from U.S. clinical trials of the drug. Even if these data where available, however, they may not have been entirely reliable. At the time, clinical trials did not require FDA approval, nor were they subject to oversight. The ‚Äúclinical trials‚Äù of thalidomide involved distributing more than two and a half million tablets of thalidomide to approximately 20,000 patients across the nation‚Äîapproximately 3,760 women of childbearing age, at least 207 of whom were pregnant. More than one thousand physicians participated in these trials, but few tracked their patients after dispensing the drug.</p>
<p>The tragedy surrounding thalidomide and Kelsey‚Äôs wise refusal to approve the drug helped motivate profound changes in the FDA. By passing the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments Act in 1962, legislators tightened restrictions surrounding the surveillance and approval process for drugs to be sold in the U.S., requiring that manufacturers prove they are both safe and effective before they are marketed. Now, drug approval can take between eight and twelve years, involving animal testing and tightly regulated human clinical trials.</p>
