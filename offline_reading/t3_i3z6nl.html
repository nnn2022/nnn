    <strong>I'm a courier, here's what I've seen</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a type of courier with a job that isn't for everyone. I live in a large metropolis of several million people, who are supposed to be on lockdown. Most people ignore it as far as I know. I don't watch the TV. </p>
<p>I'm at the state courthouse, with the state Supreme Court, doing work every day. At this point the mask level is extreme their. It's now at zero percent. No sheriff, no court clerk, and no judge is wearing a mask. Zero percent. </p>
<p>The district attorneys offices. Now at zero percent. It was fifty percent two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The federal building? Zero. Nobody. No one at all. I go through my security checks, no mask. No metal, empty all pockets, IDed by guys I've known for years, wanded down, zero masks. It's all the old normal.</p>
<p>The state capital? Zero masks.</p>
<p>I had to go to the federal reserve and I'm in the front, the very front (nobody gets to go in their), but? No masks.</p>
<p>After work I went to target. I was hounded to wear a mask. I had an old lady told me I was going to get arrested. I smiled, a smile they could see, and I said "OK" and deliberately went to a cashiered line. Where she told me I could get arrested, checked out my grocieries, and lectured me about using their no contact option so I could wait outside. I was pleasant, I said, thanks for letting me know.</p>
<p>This is being enforced from the bottom up. We are doing it to each other.</p></p>

        <p>It's a strange thing walking into a lot of stores. It's like the people put in charge of enforcing the mask order get a kick out of telling someone what to do. It's like maybe this is the first time in their career that they've been given the opportunity to give direction. It makes them feel good, because they themselves are used to only taking directions from the boss. I know they have no power over me, and they sort of do too. Like in Target yesterday a woman approached me and said, "You need to wear a mask." I told her that I didn't need to, and that I was almost done shopping and would be leaving shortly. Then another woman went up to my husband and told him he had better put on a mask. He just said that he doesn't wear a mask. The two of them just walked away together. Maybe they headed to the breakroom to discuss a better tactic, who knows.</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>“Political tags—such as royalist, communist, democrat, populist,    fascist, liberal conservative, and so forth—are never basic criteria. The    human race divides politically into those who want people to be controlled and    those who have no such desire. The former are idealists acting from highest    motives for the greatest good of the greatest number. The latter are surly    curmudgeons, suspicious and lacking in altruism. But they are more comfortable    neighbors than the other sort.”</em><br>
<em>“Being generous is inborn; being altruistic is a learned perversity. No    resemblance—“</em><br>

<p>&rt;"Men by their constitutions are naturally divided into two parties: 1.      Those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from      them into the hands of the higher classes. 2. Those who identify themselves      with the people, have confidence in them, cherish and consider them as the      most honest and safe, although not the most wise depositary of the public      interests. In every country these two parties exist, and in every one where      they are free to think, speak, and write, they will declare themselves. Call      them, therefore, Liberals and Serviles, Jacobins and Ultras, Whigs and      Tories, Republicans and Federalists, Aristocrats and Democrats, or by      whatever name you please, they are the same parties still and pursue the      same object. The last one of Aristocrats and Democrats is the true one      expressing the essence of all." <br>

<p>Don't react badly in the slightest way because it's likely they won't consider taking off their own mask if we do..</p>

        <p>Yeah. Same here. And I've been to two other states, in the northeast, that have mostly been the same way.</p>
<p>I've been seeing an increase in posts where people claim their state (some of which are PA/NJ/DE, which I've been at) has zero masks. Ever. "No one's wearing masks anywhere, not even in retail stores, not sure what <em>you're</em> talking about!" Either people are living in a parallel dimension where nobody is wearing masks, or there's lies floating about for whatever reason (maybe to stoke the flames of arguments online, where people claim no one is wearing masks, and therefore this is why cases are surging).</p>
