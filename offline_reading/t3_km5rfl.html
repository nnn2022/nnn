    <strong>In 5 years, the doomers will claim to have been anti-lockdown from the start.</strong>
    <p><p>Every piece of evidence I present to friends and family is disregarded. I am told that I am selfish for being against lockdown and mask mandates. That peoples businesses and mental health are worth sacrificing in the name of Covid-19. When I presented the NHS data released recently that showed only 0.8% of Covid deaths have been those under the age of 60, I was told to think about those over the age of 60. Fine. But why do the rest of us have to allow our mental health to suffer and our businesses become bankrupt? Why are we indebting future generations with the excessive spending of today?</p>
<p>People have a huge sunk cost when taking up a position on an important topic. People vehemently defend their position even when provided with the most concrete evidence one could provide because they don't want to admit they were wrong. When the doomers eventually face reality, in an effort to save face, they will claim that they were anti-lockdown from the start.</p>
<p>When your friends and family eventually try and spin this, please call them out.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p></p>

        <p>The worst part is that they will learn nothing. They won't be skeptical of anything or think critically, or even notice who gave them truth among the lies. They will swallow whatever new panic or war is being promoted by the media and government, demonise whoever is appropriate, the important thing being that they hold and pretend to have held the current socially accepted version of things. </p>
<p>I've permanently lost a lot of respect for a lot of people this year. Not because they disagree with me, but because they cannot engage in civil discourse or independent rational thinking.</p>

<p>Between 250,000 and 1.2 million babies along with tens of thousands of mothers will die due to covid lockdowns preventing adequate medical care and nutrition.</p>
<p>Young children dying has a far bigger societal impact than someone in their 60's, and is ethically/morally far worse. </p>

<p>Meanwhile a million children in the US have gotten covid-19 and only 133 have died. To put that into perspective, 480 children died from the flu during the 2018-19 flu season. The hospitalization rate for children with covid is 6 per 100,000 versus 39.2 per 100,000 from the flu.</p>

        <p>I too have lost friends that I have had for decades over this. There are other more acquaintance-like people who don't know that they've lost me. I don't know where this is all going to lead, and it just doesn't feel safe being around people who are agreeing with what's being done to humanity, let alone thinking we should have more done to us. I just look at history. :( If it gets to the point where we're arguing and there's resentment or shaming, I am out of the relationship. And I have found no one can be swayed right now, from experience as well learning more about trauma and what it does to the brain. It's not that I don't hang out with anyone who doesn't think like me, it's just I feel like it's an act of self-preservation to eliminate what I view to be extremists. It is so emotionally, physically, and psychologically relieving to be with people who do think what we are going through is 100% bullshit.</p>

<p>There is a clear air of that isn't there?</p>
<p>I can't help thinking of the thing Jordan Peterson asks about how you would probably have been a nazi if you were brought up in 1930s Germany. It seems to me that being pro-lockdown or passively complying with it is the clearest demonstration we have had in our lifetimes of who would have been Nazis given the chance.</p>

        <p>If you’re Christian like me, you’ll most likely be dead in the very near future (which I’m more than ready to go home), but we will have to see who makes it through the camps, who stands up for real against tyranny, who makes a stand and never takes their vax or supports their demonic agenda 21/30, global reset, etc. It’s the perfect time to mentally prepare for what’s right around the corner. Stop focusing on worldly things and focus on eternal things. May the Lord continue to wake up his people until his return and even though the evil ones are in power, I truly feel sorry for what’s coming for them in the end. God bless this sub and I pray it will continue to wake more people up.</p>

        <p>This is what I came in to say. I don’t believe any of them will ever say lockdowns were unnecessary. They will be pro lockdown and pro mask forever, and they will worship the vaccine as the savior. They’ve been too deeply brainwashed and reprogrammed.</p>

<p>Seems mighty arrogant of people in this sub to assume the narrative will shift, especially quickly. I think it could go either way in this case, but I wouldn't be surprised if people remain pro-mask/pro-lockdown forever.</p>

        <p>I think you nailed it. And that phenomenon can be seen in history too. Right after 9/11 my most liberal friends were pro revenge-war. Then slowly but surely the liberals and then most republicans who supported the war on terror tried to say they never did.</p>
<p>Or, when Trump was elected, and all my friends on the left that called Bushitler and Darth Cheney and Evil-Lynne Condie Rice and Skeletor Rumsfeld a bunch of racist nazis... they all tried to pretend they would never call anyone but Trump a racist nazi.</p>
<p>It's literally the point of 1984's "We were always at war with Eurasia/ We were never at war with Eurasia" example.</p>

        <p>People talk about a similar experience in America after 911. The American people were in general very pro war... anti war people were spun as unpatriotic, selfish, anti Americans...
Things changed after years of war in the Middle East and a people eventually claimed they were anti war all along... funny that...</p>

        <p>YUP it's exactly that. This happens for every case of mass hysteria in history. Every time you speak out during it you are told you are crazy. Then 5 years later all the "woke" people say they were against it the whole time. As unfortunate as these circumstances are, I am glad we have the receipts online.</p>

        <p>I think this has been too neatly done, with governments worldwide and WHO much too involved to allow people to believe the truth. Propaganda and Denialism forever. The narrative they keep forcing on us will be in the history books. </p>
<p>Because it happened on a global scale, there is no blaming anyone like we could with Nazi German, or Muslim terrorists. Who is gonna get blamed? Every stupid government and society around the world did the same stupid things with the exception of South Dakota, a low population state that no one will give proper consideration to.</p>

        <p>Why dont you think we will still be locked down in 2025?</p>
<p>By then, a complete useless lockdown, with all services taken over by organized crime, office districts becoming dangerous wastelands of robbery and rape (where clandestine bars, gyms, nightclubs and beauty parlors thrive with the police looking the other way), rampant unemployment, economic depression and everyone socializing in a way that hides from enforcement. Of course, exploding inflation.</p>

        <p>If we didn't continue these lockdown measures and just opened up the economy and tried to return back to normal, you do realize that our healthcare system would collapse right? Hospitals would be too full of Covid patients to be able to handle anything else. </p>
<p>Is Covid something that MOST people who contract will survive? Sure, but enough people would die that America would be absolutely done for. Think outside the box, people. I'm tired of things being shut down too, but it's saving lives.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's not true at all. Countries whose citizens take science seriously (wearing masks, social distancing etc) have been able to curb the spread. The US has more deaths and cases than any other country for a reason...because we have a significant portion of our population that is scientifically illiterate and is duped eaily by fake news. 
What we needed was a competent government to pay its citizens consistently so businesses can shut down temporarily without having to close permanently. Now, because people didn't take it seriously, the economic fallout is to be expected.</p>
