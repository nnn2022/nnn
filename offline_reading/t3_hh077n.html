        <p>I'm introverted as hell but the loneliness during lockdown really got to me. </p>
<p>Even though my area generally had low support for new normalism during lockdown, everything being closed made going outside pointless, and trying to go out didn't help since I would just be surrounded by the depressing sight of shut up storefronts and not many others out. I got depressed and hopeless and it didn't help I was dealing with health problems during lockdown I felt like I couldn't talk about since everyone would think I have 'rona and shame me out.</p>
<p>Honestly, my saving grace is that my GF moved in with me right before lockdowns began, I felt like I would have snapped if she wasn't there.</p>
<p>And I am a real introvert. I think even the most introverted people got close to snapping during lockdown. Isolation is the worst thing you can do to the human psyche.</p>
<p>May 13th, the day the lawsuit against the governor saw it's fruits and the Supreme Court of Wisconsin voted to end the lockdown, was a glorious day.</p>
