        <p>Do note that the USA and other countries have been on the list of countries to have purchased it for months, now confirmed by them themselves for <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irish-based-roqu-group-launches-world-first-health-passport-digital-platform-to-support-increased-global-covid-19-testing-301120037.html">launch</a>. </p>
<p>&rt;ROQU Group has announced that, in addition to Ireland, the Health Passport platform will be launched in the US, UK, Italy, Kenya and Germany, with other locations to follow. Health Passport has been developed as part of ROQU's international philanthropic and altruistic mission.</p>
<p>And from June (here)[https://medium.com/@aarondavidsonn/the-health-passport-a-green-light-for-tyranny-545298e108d]</p>
<p>&rt;The Digital Health Passport is already shipping, and contracts have been signed with 15 countries including the US, Canada, Sweden, Spain, South Africa, Italy, Portugal, France, Panama, India, Mexico, United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Irish responded with angry and outrage though, so maybe they've killed it for everyone else and they will vanish.</p>

        <p>Has it been criticised in the Irish media? I haven't seen any criticism of it. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary in the UK, said there plan is to be able to test the entire population and link that to an app on your phone in an interview with the Guardian. This is far from dead, it's only just starting.</p>

        <p>It's barely been reported in the media according to family over there but every story was spun to try to be positive? It's the comments, and reaction of the people themselves not the media. They got slaughtered. They even deleted their Instagram after the Irish took no shit.</p>
