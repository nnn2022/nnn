        <p>My point is, American presidents have always tried to boost morale. Now Trump is being criticized again for trying to do so.</p>

        <p>The war brought the American Economy back from the depression.  FDR simply slipped a healthy dose of socialism in with the deal.  He started the federal withholding tax.  In fact, he tried to tax all income over $100,000 at 99.5%.  When it didn't work, he issued an executive order to tax all income over $25,000 at 100%.  He also issued an order requiring all citizens to sell their gold to the government.</p>
<p>But it's not just economic.  George Washington started a precedent that we take quite seriously.  After independence was gained, Washington could have easily been made king.  In fact, there was a large push for it.  But he declined and instead set a precedent that a president shouldn't serve more than two terms.  FDR decided he was just going to stay president until he died.  And then he did just that, dying in his fourth term.  To this day, he's the only president to serve more than two terms.</p>
<p>None of this is the worst of it.  It makes me laugh when people talk about systemic racism in the US today.  Especially since most of the people complaining idolize FDR.  During the war, FDR put about 75,000 American citizens in concentration camps because they were of Japanese descent.  Look it up.  I don't understand how something like this gets overlooked the way it does.  </p>
<p>The man was a monster.  It also makes me laugh when people talk about Trump like he's the worst president ever.  Don't get me wrong, I'm embarrassed of Trump.  I can't believe these morons made that moron the president.  But there is no stain on the US presidency that even approaches FDR.</p>

        <p>No problem, I do too.</p>
<p>He, probably more than any other president, not only kicked the scourge of "for-your-own-good"ism into high gear but made it a respectable, almost sanctified position for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>I mean, that happened while he was president and he supported it.  Can't really count it as his accomplishment.</p>
