    <strong>Research opportunity!</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, I hope this is allowed</p>
<p>I’m doing a uni project about different views surrounding Covid-19, so about the vaccinations, what the government is telling us, if the virus was created or not. It’s a chance for people to share their views and be listened to. Often people with strong views don’t get that chance. </p>
<p>This the link, anyone can take part. It’s a questionnaire that takes about 10-15 mins - https://www.questionpro.com/t/ARTkmZknkI</p>
<p>It’s been properly approved ethically and my stance is purely neutral. Let me know what you think. It would really be appreciated. I’m hoping it might get published so it would be really good to get a range of views and like I say give people a platform to be heard.</p>
<p>Thanks
Leigh</p></p>

        <p>I took the survey. Just an observation on a couple questions. The one that asks if I'm afraid of losing my life because of covid. I'm afraid of committing suicide because of covid, so that question could be interpreted a couple ways and if the people analyzing the results are only thinking along one train of thought, the answers could be misintrepreted.</p>
<p>The same thing with the question about "my heart races when I think of covid". Yes, because I'm angry. Not because I'm worried about catching it. So if I answer yes, does the person interpreting the results think I'm scared?</p>
<p>Maybe all of that has been taken into consideration and I'm over thinking this, but I thought it might be helpful to point out.</p>

        <p>Stopping the New Normal means stopping nonsense like this. We have told you what we think, we dont need to do a 'survey' so that you can find a way to destroy us. Its he university-think tank system needs to be destroyed, it is people like you that have created this hell.</p>
