    <strong>The good news is...</strong>
    <p><p>the vast, VAST majority of us are not in any real danger of health problems because of 'it'. We didn't know that a year ago, it was new. I admit I was scared of 'it', to the point that I stopped grabbing a cart on my way into the store and instead opted to take one that they had sanitized. Now we know that surface to surface transmission is <em>extraordinarily</em> rare, if even possible, but we didn't know. Many mistakes were made, and many still are. In my area they put yellow tape around all of the playground equipment in the parks, ostensibly to keep people from forming crowds that would facilitate 'the spread'. They also removed the basketball rims for presumably the same reason. Funny thing though, they stopped putting the yellow tape up months before they returned the rims. There are lots of inconsistencies like that; the most startling one to me is that people are allowed to eat on commercial flights. Here we have a virus so dangerous that virtually the entire world has altered their way of life; a virus so dangerous that schools and churches and restaurants and many other businesses have been closed. A virus so deadly that it's nearly impossible to go anywhere that doesn't require wearing a mask.  So very very very dangerous, BUT, if you happen to be eating on a commercial aircraft, well then, never mind.  It's just not <em>that</em> dangerous I guess.  You guys can think of many more examples; they are abundant.  I just wanted to say that the good news is that we're really not getting sick. It sure seemed bad a year or so ago but by now it's easy to see that it's just not as dangerous as they say.</p></p>

        <p>I started to get concerned when I read about <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/Guidelines_Cause_of_Death_COVID-19.pdf">the guidance the WHO had issued for the registration of deaths</a> in April 2020. It meant that deaths which would otherwise be counted as cancer, Alzheimer's, etc, would now be counted as Covid-19 if the deceased had had a positive PCR test in the last 28 days or if a doctor even suspected the deceased had had Covid-19. There seemed to be no good reason for this and the result would be to vastly inflate the number of deaths from covid. (Here's <a href="https://dr-no.co.uk/2021/01/30/ode-to-the-death-certificate/">a very informative article about this</a>, if you're interested)</p>
<p>Later, around May, I found out how PCR testing worked, how they <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/?PageSpeed=noscript">weren't intended to be used for diagnosis</a> and about the likely huge number of <a href="https://swprs.org/the-trouble-with-pcr-tests/">false positives</a> that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/health/22whoop.html">these tests</a> were producing. </p>
<p>In February 2020, we had been told that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200229221645/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/worse-than-flu-busting-coronavirus-myths">the infection fatality rate (IFR) of Covid-19 was 1%</a>, 'ten times more deadly than the flu'. But by May, studies were suggesting <a href="https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892.pdf">an IFR of 0.23%</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all of these issues being known in May 2020, lockdowns and restrictions continued and even became more severe (I live in Ireland and we have been in lockdown since March 2020, except for a few weeks last summer). Regulations which made no sense from a health perspective were imposed.</p>
<p>Double standards were applied, in terms of which businesses could open and which could not (with small businesses always suffering the most). I found it hard to believe that the same politicians who had imposed severe cuts to our health service would now sacrifice entire sectors of the economy to save a few lives.</p>
<p>Governments, in my country and around the world, passed laws banning protests and giving police extraordinary powers. It seemed anything was on the table when it came to covid.</p>
<p>Respected scientists and doctors with dissenting opinions, like John Ionnidas and John Lee, were excluded from the mainstream conversation while billionaires with dubious medical expertise and questionable motivation, such as Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab, were sought out for their wisdom.</p>
<p>I'd learned that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/">the EU had an agenda, existing since 2018</a>, to compel European citizens to posess 'Vaccination Passports'. So when, in the autumn time, we were told that the only way to deal with Covid-19 was vaccination for all, I finally put that part of the jigsaw together.</p>
<p>Hope that answers your question :)</p>

        <p>The thing that kills the pre-planned conspiracies for me is that they performed a 180 when it came to face masks.</p>
<p>It's obvious from all the lies and censorship taking place that their is some agenda behind all of this, we just can't say with certainty what that is yet. </p>
<p>Whatever the agenda is, it started between us being told not to wear face masks, then being told to wear them.</p>
<p>If this was pre-planned, I don't see why they would have told everybody not to wear face masks at the beginning.</p>
<p>That 180 made a lot of people very sceptical, while others were confused, making people reluctant to wear the masks. Had they told everybody to wear masks from the offset, they would have had more people complying.</p>

        <p>The mask situation is interesting. I think that when the whole thing began, around March of last year, there simply weren't enough masks available. If they'd made them compulsory at that stage it would have been impossible for most people to comply. Plus a lot of those who didn't have a mask would have started freaking out, worried they were going to die.</p>
<p>Obviously mask factories went into overdrive between March and June/July!</p>
<p>I also think politicians and NWO types were emboldened by the way the vast majority of people around the world complied with the first lockdown and all the regulations that came with it.</p>
<p>The mask mandate was introduced in Ireland in July. It made no sense. Coronaviruses are at their lowest level of transmission at this time of year. There were hardly even any poitive PCR tests at that stage. But the vast majority of people complied.</p>
<p>I think this whole thing has been on the cards for a long time, but I don't think the powers that be thought it would be so easy for them carry it off. Thankfully more people are starting to wake up.</p>

        <p>I had considered the possibility that the issue would have been with the number of masks available at the time, but we were told to wear any kind of face covering when the mandates first came in. At least that's the way it was in the Philippines. I don't recall exactly how it was everywhere else at the time. </p>
<p>The rules in the Philippines now still haven't been updated and you can wear any kind of face covering as the legislation isn't at all specific. I believe this is similar in many other places.</p>
<p>They could have simply told everybody to wear face coverings from the offset, then changed this to needing to wear specific kind of masks once they had produced enough.</p>

        <p>It's the same in Ireland. The rule is that you can wear any face covering, but everybody wears a mask. </p>
<p>I think the mask is all about creating a sense of submission and control, like when they <a href="https://jdfor2020.com/2020/08/guantanamo-torture-surgical-masks-make-breathing-more-difficult/">used them on the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay</a>. If they had normalised just any face covering back in March 2020, then perhaps people wouldn't have felt masks were necessary. And the mask is an important symbol in all of this. I don't think other face coverings have the same psychological impact as masks do.</p>
<p>However, these are just my thoughts. You may well be correct that something significant happened between us being told not to wear them and then being told we had to wear them.</p>

        <p>Alternative explanation: there’s an active conspiracy led by a (relatively) small group of people, and everyone else follows out of fear/pressure. </p>
<p>That’s much more plausible than “literally everyone is in on it” (that’s almost impossible to keep a secret for so long), and consistent with human behavior. </p>
<p>Under this theory, Fauci told the truth in the beginning, and then succumbed to pressure to reverse course (likely under the benign explanation of “people are panicking and it is essential to diminish their fear, masks will help them feel safe” or similar). A few similar pressures on key people in “leader” countries, and then everyone else simply follows. </p>
<p>That also explains how you have some divergent behavior emerging - Sweden for a while, Florida, etc. These folks are the ones not giving into pressure and hype; if this were a “we’re all in cahoots taking over the world for our communist fantasy” deal, these dissenters would either go along out of self-preservation or (in some cases) feel that it merits exposure/push back, even at high personal cost. </p>
<p>It’s honestly easier to direct behavior through social pressure than it is to get widespread buy in to a commie take over (or any plan for that matter).</p>

<p>Bingo, we have a winner!</p>
<p>This is the first "pandemic" that has 24/7 advertising, it includes brainwashing, cult-minded individuals and wait for it: FREE VACCINES sponsored by Bill Gates and the Fauci Funky Bunch!</p>

        <p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/">Prof. John Ioniddas's study</a> (published 3 wks ago) shows a mortality rate of 0.15% for covid.</p>
<p>Flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%, so covid is one and a half times more deadly than flu.</p>
<p>Health-wise, it really is just like a bad flu. But I don't think this was ever about a virus.</p>

<p>I think it was about how much the government and media can get away with. And we passed the litmus test for what we as a society allowed them to get away with.</p>
