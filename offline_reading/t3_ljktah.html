    <strong>Why shouldn't we let the virus help us?</strong>
    <p><p>So, I'm not here to debate how the virus came into being, or whether it exists... But what do you guys thinking about the fact that we could've used it to solve some of societies biggest problems? Overpopulation in particular - if the virus kills the unhealthy / those with pre-existing conditions, by continuing on as normal through the virus we would be removing inferior genetics from the gene pool. As well as this, maybe saying goodbye to a small percentage of our aging population would also not be such a bad thing? This would reduce consumption across the globe, and slow down the need to build more houses etc. 
Also, the global elite may be able to afford better healthcare and the ability to self isolate, but with a virus thats got people wiping down their items when they return from the supermarket, the chances of it wiping out a few billion dollars of wealth from a toxic generation would surely be pretty high?
I don't know, these are just some ideas I had.
But as a human I feel pretty stripped of my dignity and also, obviously all social interaction by enforced lockdowns in my country (UK), and obviously no political leader would suggest these ideas as its political suicide, but I'm just keen to see if this way of thinking resonates with anyone else?</p>
<p>tldr; no lockdowns, optional mask wearing, if hospitals are full, they're full &amp; you die - that's the risk you take for going outside during a pandemic. strengthening of gene pool, death of a percentage of the aging population &amp; perhaps even a few members of the global elite? more houses, more resources &amp; less demand so a reduction in cost. win win?</p></p>

        <p>Well for starters, the whole overpopulation thing is total bullshit. I’m not here to be nasty, I do mean to be nice and informative with what I say so please keep that in mind :)</p>
<p>Overpopulation is a complete lie. Look here in Australia, 28M people that occupy about 2% of the total land mass. Other countries will be similar, not as extreme, but similar. </p>
<p>Letting the elderly die is an interesting idea. Logically without emotion, it makes total sense in regards to the economy and resources. But who gets to decide what the age cutoff is? And who has the right to decide who dies? It moves into nazi territory of deciding who’s valuable and who dies. </p>
<p>Also, it’s not just age. I know some 70 year olds who are healthier and more active than 40 year olds. So if we condemn 70+ year olds to die, what if 80% are healthier than 60% of 40 year olds? So could we then say let’s kill all 40 year olds instead? They seem pretty unhealthy and lazy and used up so why not? You know?</p>
<p>My partner’s nephew is one of the sweetest, smartest and kindest kids I’ve ever seen in my life but occasionally uses an asthma inhaler... should he die tomorrow and his gene pool be wiped out?</p>
<p>And in terms of consumption, like we don’t have enough food and water to feed the world, that’s also a total lie. We actually have enough food currently available to feed the world for 20 years (from memory I think that’s right). The real problem is all the waste and greed. Currently over our 5 day lockdown here in Australia in the state of Victoria, just under $10M worth of food is going to waste. Also, look into how much water is used in industrial farming worldwide like the cattle farms... when you learn how much water is wasted to produce meat (which as a meat lover, I can say we don’t actually need), you’ll shit your pants. </p>
<p>It really comes down to learning the truth, like the lies of overpopulation and lies of not enough food, to make decent decisions and thinking about who has the right to point at someone and say “yeah him, he dies today. And her, she’s going as well. For the sake of others”.</p>

        <p>Thanks! I'm not here to argue and also keen to learn! I'm also not coming with quantitative figures to support my ideas but that's because I just wanted an open discussion rather than fact spamming all of you! So if people have the numbers then please provide them.</p>
<p>I think the overpopulation narrative for me comes from an ecological point of view - the world needs more wild space in order to protect it from climate disasters and enable it to re-form the environmental system - but we can't have this wild space we need as so much of our land is taken up for agricultural use, and further land is being cleared just to produce cheap meat etc. If we had less demand for this, we could rewild.</p>
<p>With the whole 'let old people die' narrative I'm not suggesting a cut off for age, I'm literally saying if you get the virus, and it has you hospitalised but there aren't enough beds, then you die, that's the risk you take? I didn't want to delve into who we choose to give hospital beds to because that's a whole other debate.</p>
<p>I also have asthma so I'm not coming from a place with no pre-existing conditions - if the virus were to kill me then, fair play, natural selection at work I guess?</p>
<p>The food waste debate is also a big one, I'm aware that supermarkets will often refuse fruit and veg that not of a certain shape / size that's appealing to the eye, and the amount of resources used to rear herds of animals just to slaughter, I'm in the same boat as you as a meat lover!</p>

        <p>In all honesty, you look at all other species that have existed throughout time on earth and there’s always been a balance. If it was up to me, all humans would be wiped out.

        <p>r/NoNewNormal couldn't care less about the two million that HAVE died as a result of COVID. Then moan and pretend to care when the vaccine which was administered to roughly twice as many people kills 600. If that's not hypocritical, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>As to Australia, isn't it mostly desert though?</p>

<p>The world is not overpopulated. This is the propaganda that genocidal neo-Malthusians espouse to justify eugenics. There are MORE than enough resources to sustain every single human being on this planet. In fact, we currently throw away 35-40% of the food that is produced, which could easily solve malnutrition and starvation.</p>

        <p>I've worked in the produce section of a supermarket wasting away fruit &amp; veg that wasn't appealing enough to customers &amp; that's not including what happens before it reaches the shelves so trust me I know we throw a lot away! But just because we produce enough, its clearly not all getting to where it needs to be? so at the current moment I'd still say we have reached our carrying capacity on earth until we can solve the problems of distribution</p>

        <p>We have the tech and ability to make sure that wastage is eliminated and that the unwanted produce reaches the starving. It's called efficiency and we've managed to build it in every other industry. The only thing missing is the willpower to get it done and as long as your "we have reached our carrying capacity" ilk exists, achieving that will never happen.</p>

        <p>With the way we currently operate, we have reached our carrying capacity. But that doesn't mean to say that we can't operate in a more sustainable way by increasing efficiency, enhancing distribution and therefore eliminating waste. I know we have enough food, but that doesn't mean that the way we are currently operating isn't at carrying capacity? It's about environmental degradation balancing out with the number of humans on earth, and we are currently degrading at an increasing rate so therefore we must be at capacity?</p>

        <p>So simply a belief its not real is enough to not get it? Or masks are causing it? I'm not sure what your point  is? How is belief whether it's real or not related to catching it?</p>
<p>Then again, I dont think you undedstand your point either. I stumbled across this page by chance and its fucking hilarious some of the lunatic conspiracy shit on here from all the "educated" and "real woke" people. From the Nintendo 64 logo being used as the pages picture to dumb shit like this persons post and your response. Its fucking amazing how a collection of absolute idiots can convince themselves they're the truly informed ones while the rest of the world is brainwashed.</p>
<p>No, you're all fucking gullible lunatics using facebook memes as your information source. Desperately using confirmation bias to convince yourself it's not real because you're all terrified and insecure.</p>

<p>"It's kind of sad what this pandemic has done to people". I could not agree more, imagine being so deluded you actively disobey advice that saves lives. It's truly highlighted the selfish monsters of society. I think a little hostility towards those people is very much needed.</p>

        <p>Classic case of putting words in peoples mouths. I dont hope anyone would die, it's the exact opposite. I want people to live. That's why dumb cunts actively contributing to the deaths of innocent people kind of piss me off lol.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with following rules and everything to do with caring for other human beings. </p>
<p>So what if I'm wrong? I had to walk around with a mask on for a bit and see friends and family less. Not ideal but it's no biggy.</p>
<p>But what if you're wrong? You are helping spread a potentially deadly virus to innocent people?</p>
<p>It's a fucking no brainer my man. Give a child that option and they will obviously pick the former.</p>
<p>It comes down to sheer arrogance and delusion on the part of the deniers that they are so confident they are right (with absolutely zero scientific proof) that they are willing to risk lives. Its fucking absurd and I'm yet to meet an intelligent denier who can address this point without veering off on some tangent about other nonsense conspiracies.</p>
<p>Honestly, I feel like I'm talking to another fucking species sometimes. We may have stopped evolving physically but mentally, we are so diverse. Too many monkey brained neanderthals still around shouting harmful nonsense. Educate yourself.</p>

        <p>What if i'm wrong about what? I wear my mask in places where i'm mandated to. I still see my friends, but only outside where it's well ventilated. I got tested 3 times last Summer when I showed symptoms (all 3 times came back negative). Fuck, I was sanitizing my hands and washing my hands for 20 seconds before COVID made it popular to. </p>
<p>You know where my anger is placed? On the government for ignoring industrial workplace spread and LTC home spread and directly contributing more to spreading this virus and death than you or me are - or anyone not wearing a mask in a grocery store. It's also placed on the media for nonstop fearmongering and not holding the government accountable for their fuck up's we all have to pay for.  <em>That's</em> why i'm on this sub. Not because I think COVID doesn't exist or because I think masks are stupid (neither of which I believe). But there's people here that actually are as critical to the lockdowns and the government response as I am and it's refreshing in the current world of idiocy.</p>
<p>I'm not a COVID denier, nor is most of this sub. We're just sick of the 'new normal' narrative and the idea that we should live like hostages under house arrest indefinitely for a virus with a 99.5%+ survival rate. This isn't March 2020 anymore, we have more information about this virus. Specific data that shows exactly where it spreads and where our attention should be placed. Data that shows it's not nearly as deadly as was once initially believed. Data that shows lockdowns don't work since COVID follows seasonal trends like several other diseases. I could go on and on.</p>
<p>You can use as much projection and hyperbole as you want, but the data is out there and this sub is for people that don't just fall victim to the bullshit the media spews out to people void of any critical thought. </p>
<p>Anyways, you better still have this same energy once the pandemic is over and wear your mask during flu season every year. Caring for others won't end after the pandemic now, will it? You better hold yourself accountable!</p>

        <p>Maybe I was wrong about you in particular then, I jumped to a conclusion about you so, apologies. My points still stand against the OP of the thread and the majority of other posts I've seen on this page though.</p>
<p>If you're following the rules then good on you, you're doing your bit. I completely agree some choices of governments around the world have been fucking ridiculous. I'm UK based and the decision to send kids into schools with no distancing implemented, reopening pubs too early, limiting distance you can travel to walk /exercise outdoors, have all incredibly stupid and not thought out ideas. I'm not brown nosing government recommendations, some are clearly ridiculous. My frustration comes from the rules that are clearly (or at least should be) common sense. Wear a fucking mask, it doesnt take a genius to realise the difference between sneezing or coughing with a mask on or off. Wash your fucking hands more often and whenever you've been in public... there is a harmful virus about. Dont gather in large groups because again... common sense. Large groups will transmit in larger numbers.</p>
<p>My problem is with the sheer number of people not even willing to accommodate that small set of rules because of reasons previously mentioned. I've seen a lot of deniers and anti maskers on this page. They are the people that piss me off. If you have a difference in opinion on the rules being set, then fair enough, I encourage people to have those discussions. But if you're flat out refusing it doesnt exist or it isnt actually a problem, then you're simply a fucking moron. I have seen a lot of that shit on this page.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that, thank you. Sorry myself if I went a bit harsh on you, but as you can imagine everyday people come here labelling everyone here as "anti-mask Trumpies who don't think COVID exists" and it gets a bit tiresome since not everyone here is against "the new normal" for the same reasons. </p>
<p>I follow the rules to a certain extent - when they make sense to. Wear a mask inside a crowded store? Sure. Masks don't work 100% at preventing COVID spread, but it's the least I can do. Wear a mask outside in a well ventilated environment with no one else around me? Hell no. </p>
<p>I take HUGE issue with a lot of the tyrannical shit governments are doing that punish people more so than they prevent the spread of COVID. I'm in Canada, so shit like the curfew in a province here where you can't exit your house past 8 p.m., not even to go for a walk by yourself. Shit like having to pay a fortune out of pocket to quarantine in a hotel/prison if you come in from out of the country. Shit like not being allowed to buy non-essential items in stores, etc etc... That's what I mainly like to discuss on this sub. </p>
<p>I encourage you to read a few more posts on this sub. I actually haven't really come in contact with that many anti-maskers or any COVID deniers. There are actually many people here who are simply just critical of the pandemic response and who question whether the right approach was really taken and is still being taken. Of course, like in any political subs, there's going to be some extremists. But they certainly don't represent everyone.</p>

        <p>Completely respect your points. In Canada they have implemented a curfew? What the actual fuck... that's insane. I for one take my mask off the moment I leave a shop and I laugh at the people who drive with a mask on. There are the extremes of both ends and I guess its easy to get carried away assuming a person is on one extreme or the other. Especially given the sensitivity of the topic. </p>
<p>I'll take a look at a few more posts but I have to say, reasonable and legitimate opinions like your own, seem to be rare from what I've seen. The top post currently is making comparisons of covid to the American civil war and another is claiming its child abuse to put a mask on a child... the fact these are top posts doesnt reflect great on the page as a whole.</p>

        <p>Yeah in Quebec. And worst is people think it's working when the reality is, besides the post-Christmas crash in numbers being the main reason for dropping cases, less people are getting tested since they can't be out after a certain time. So yeah, it really worked well all right lmao. And even if it did work, that's too tyrannical for my liking.</p>
<p>&rt; There are the extremes of both ends and I guess its easy to get carried away assuming a person is on one extreme or the other. Especially given the sensitivity of the topic.</p>
<p>Yeah that's normal nowadays though. Political tensions and divisions are at an all time high, and this pandemic is super polarizing so that just intensified that. Sometimes I have to catch myself from doing the same. </p>
<p>I mainly stick to the Chat/Vent/Support post that's stickied at the top of the sub since I find most interesting conversation surrounding the pandemic restrictions takes place there. /r/LockdownSkepticism might be more up your alley, there's not as much conspiracy stuff there. I like both subs, but I prefer spending my time on this one for the discussion thread. </p>
<p>Thanks for actually having an intelligent convo though, I had you all wrong. Most people just come here to yell and scream then leave so it's nice to interact with someone that took a step back and listened for a minute.</p>
