    <strong>Talk to me Canada. Was the Basic Income secretly the Pre-CERB Study this whole time?</strong>
    <p><p>A few years ago the Ontario Government put three cities to test out a Basic Income (Lindsay, ThunderBay and Hamilton 2017) THE GOVERNMENT KNEW COVID WAS AROUND THE CORNER. </p>
<p>It was a LIE FROM THE START! The Ontario Government wanted to run a real time simulation against PANDEMIC CONDITIONS. They got their precious data then scrapped the program early, calling it a waste of money leaving the Ontario Government with time to prepare.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the CERB was released and no one around cares to mentions how similar the CERB is to the Basic Income? I am sorry, but I know well enough there are people in rooms making decisions with other top level people probably in another room believing they represent the PUBLIC SPHERE! so on and so forth.. You get the idea. Don't believe it. </p>
<p>Why is this happening? Human Activity. Our habits, or specifically our consuming habits is bad for everybody, The waters, the air and the animals. The planet will by fine. It breathes in and out, but us humans are so precious and small. We will bend, break and be forced to adapt the best we can to whatever the world throws at us. The real problems is US. Human Activity needs to SLOW DOWN and we CONSUME LESS. </p>
<p>THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE LOCKDOWN. it isn't COVID (still deadly, still serious) It is to LIMIT TRAVEL. Why? Control. Either something else is around the corner, or the CAPITALIST way of doing things is evolving into something new. Or our planet really is suffering all while the wealthy refuse to part ways with old business. </p>
<p>If you want to make the sheep move then put a herding dog in there. When the sheep are happy more sheep appear. Control the dogs, control the sheep. Now, COMPARTMENTALIZE the sheep and give them restrictions. The smaller the control groups the better (COVID VARIANTS) or better yet, every sheep gets a dog (VACCINATION PROOF so you can travel). See where I am going with this? The Paradigm is shifting or it is being forced. What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>I dont know about CERB, but as for the UBI (universal basic income):</p>
<p>UBI is certainly part of the agenda.</p>
<p>Last year the Pope and WEF called for UBI and it fits perfectly with the CBDC, ID2020, social scoring, total control agenda.</p>

        <p>CERB is a basic income. If you earn 500$ in 2 weeks, they will send you 500$. Basic income of 1000$ per 2 weeks or 2000$ per month. Just not universal, yet.</p>

        <p>One hundred percent controlled, they are running the show on auto pilot. No amount of data or good arguments are going to stop them at this point. I’m looking to do a masters in about a year which will eventually allow me to get a 3 year work visa in the states, I pray I can get down to Az or Texas without needing a vaccine passport, thankfully it seems that the US will not make it a federal thing so if you wanna get out of Canadastan it might still be possible in a year or two. The question is if any airline will still allow you to fly without one or if the US / Canada border will be open yet.</p>
