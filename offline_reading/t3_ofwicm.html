    <strong>A small rant</strong>
    <p><p>I have a frustrating situation. I wear a mask (envo n95, yup I look ridiculous) because I live with someone that has late stage multiple myeloma. I'm not concerned about contacting this plague personally, rather I'm concerned about the fact that even the sniffles would kill my housemate. I'm not vaccinated, and have no intention of ever doing so. That's a line I will not cross. I wear a mask out of the abundance of caution for him.</p>
<p>The problem is the absolute crap I get for it. I live in a blue state, so (nearly) everyone who isn't masked is vaccinated. Further, I only shop at the coop, because our grocery store sucks, so there's the affluent, nanny stater that shops there. The policy there is no vaccine, wear mask. People see a(relatively) young and healthy person wearing a mask and I'm treated like all leper. The glances, people keeping their distance, and not talking to me is frustrating. The check out people will literally stop taking once I'm up. I've been asked to wait for others to clear the line. Basically, I'm unclean to them. </p>
<p>Then there's the attitude that everyone wearing a mask still is sheep. I get the thought, but there's some of us that have to, just to keep others safe. I work in construction, and the shit I have to deal with when picking up supplies is almost as bad as the nannies at the coop. Like, I get it, I'm the sheep wearing a mask to you, but I'm really just trying to survive, work to pay my bills, and keep my buddy alive. </p>
<p>I guess, there's really no point to this rant. Except that I've become acutely aware of the caste system forming, and please be mindful that there are allies amongst the mask wearers and the lepers. </p>
<p>Peace</p></p>

        <p>Stop caring what people think.  Switch from worrying about what they think to enjoying the fact they are triggered by you doing the right thing to protect a vulnerable person.  They are literally letting your own reasonable choice negatively impact their state.  Says a lot about the kind of people they are.</p>
<p>Sounds like you have a lot of virtue signaling types in your area.  Similar problem here...</p>
<p>As it's said when it comes to people who can't mind their own business and practice a little bit of "live and let live"...</p>

        <p>I feel for you, friend, especially as an N95 is actually a medical mask (not just a 'face covering' which does nothing). Unfortunately masks have became tribal talismans in a social game, and it's zero sum. You can't win whether you wear one or not.</p>

        <p>Hardly anyone wears a mask where I live anymore (and I don’t) but I’ve never been mean or rude to the few people who still do. Live and let live. And I think you’re smart for not getting the vaccine.</p>

<p>There's no point to any rant except to get it out of your system.  Hope it helped. </p>
<p>But you put your finger on the fault line.  You wanna wear a mask?  Wear a mask.  You wanna wear a full body isolation suit?  Go ahead, but I admit I might stare. </p>
<p>But the hypocrisy can be hard to handle.  Six months ago:  No mask get shunned.  Now: wear a mask get shunned.  It seems none of us are as self assured as we would like to think.</p>
<p>In short: Fuck 'em.</p>
