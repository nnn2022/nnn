        <p>No, I'm a Nurse on the respiratory disease ward. I have spent 4 years studying and even without that training and research my 5th grade biology class is more then enough information to understand how viruses work, ill dumb it down for you, Covid is a virus spread through droplets, when you sneeze, cough or spit the virus hitches a ride on those droplets into some one else, infecting them hence why staying the fuck inside and covering your mouth with a mask that blocks droplets entering your mouth and nose stops people from being infected.</p>
<p>Get it now dumb cunt?</p>

        <p>Thanks tips. I got that much. But im good thanks. Also. Are you guys at tour hospital calling every death covid? Cause my aunt died from a massive syroke after two negative covid tests her death was called covid. You are paid to shut your mouth as if you speak out nurses everywhere are losing their jobs. If you wanna continue lying to yourself thats fine. Im just done with it. You can wear your masks, thats fine, i choose not to and you should respect that choive too, as im not sick and havent been for almost a year. Crazy what vitamins can do. Thanks for the kind words. They really make your side of the arguement legitimate. Have a wonderful day and try not to gey sick and die from a super deadly virus that only kills the unwell</p>

        <p>PA. Basically all large events (I cared about anime cons) are either cancelled or priced through the roof. Every store, unless you're in a rural area, requires a mask and the employees act like fucking Nazis about it. When you go out to eat, if you can still afford it, all the tables have you behind fucking plexiglass. Small businesses can't open at more than 50% unless they pay the government.</p>

        <p>In Quebec, Canada, there is a curfew at 9:30pm.  If you're caught out after that, you'll get a fine.</p>
<p>Masks are enforced and everywhere.  All "non-essential" businesses are closed, meaning Walmart, Loblaws, and all the other Big Box Stores are open.  But not small businesses.</p>
<p>Restaurants in Quebec had spent tens of thousands of dollars to retrofit their locales with plexiglass etc.  Now they've been told they can't run.  Tens of thousands in safety "upgrades", all down the drain.</p>
<p>In January, it had reached the height of absurdity.  As there were complaints some stores were allowed to open and others not, some stores started getting lists of items they <em>could not</em> sell during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The results were hilarious.  For example, the bookstore was allowed to remain open...  <em>But it wasn't allowed to sell books</em>.  They could sell magazines and newspapers, but not books (I am not making that up).</p>
<p>In the pharmacy, you could buy hair dye, but not make up.</p>
<p>You could go to a pet store and buy a toy for your dog.  But baby care stores selling toys for kids were closed.</p>
<p>In the grocery store, you couldn't buy Tupperware or a rice cooker.  But you could buy potato chips and beer.</p>
<p>(I'm not making this up.  I have pictures for proof).</p>
<p>Of course, the government owned liquor stores and marijuana dispensaries were open the whole time, and operating with immunity.  Usually a line up around the block for these things.</p>
<p>January was a level of absurdity on a level of parody.  I sometimes wonder if Quebec had drawn the short stick in the globalist wet dream experience.   There really couldn't be a better explanation for what we saw and are still seeing.  Quebec is cucked up big time right now.</p>

        <p>CO and mask mandates have eased in some counties but not all. Denver won’t even matter if Polis drops the mask mandates because the mayor will probably reinstate it. Businesses and restaurants are open with social distancing bs.</p>

        <p>target workers are aggressive, ive been followed around the store before.. they’re crazy 
today i went into a few stores and half of them tried to make me wear a mask (i just left instead) the other half did not bother me about it. i think it rlly depends on the person and if their job is intense about it. it made me happy to have encountered people that actually let me show my face, it’s been a long time since it’s been that way ,  gave me a little hope</p>

        <p>Western Canada. We were starting to open up and it was great but because the "varients" are spreading we had to double downed again on restrictions:</p>
<p>-No in seat dining (take out/pick up)</p>
<p>-Museums/movie theatre/galleries/rec centers are all closed.</p>
<p>-Mandatory masks in all indoor places.</p>
<p>-Limit on the # of people in your home or outside.</p>
<p>-Heavily encouraging working from home.</p>
<p>-Most schooling is being done online right now due to outbreaks.</p>
<p>It really sucks right now and I know a lot of businesses are really suffering right now with a lack of customer foot traffic. There is still doomers screeching for more restrictions/lockdowns but the government is ignoring them for now and putting all their faith in the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Tn. The eastern side. Our governor never made a mask mandate he left it up to the county mayors. Most counties around us have dropped theirs - our mayor hasn’t yet. But the governors allowance ends end of this month. I haven’t worn one since day 1 - and the only time someone got nasty and followed us was in a Disney store in sevierville (several hrs from me). Every once in a while they will ask - but there’s so many not wearing them now most places don’t even try anymore. Everything is open. And restaurants can be packed full now.</p>

        <p>Ontario, Canada here.  Been in lockdown for most of the last year - hardest lockdown since November.  They have moved us around to different levels, but it has been moving from "lockdown" to "lockdown."  Now we are moving back to 'Stay at home order' for at least another month.

        <p>Originally from NYC. Last time I was there was January. 110% mask compliance indoors and outdoors. 90% double masking with gloves as well. Most business shut down completely and are out of business forever. When I left nothing was open like bars or restaurants unless you wanted to freeze outside or take home. Streets dirty and filled with an increased amount of homeless people who aren't masked and strangely doing just fine. Most people went remote with work and assumed they'd never go back to the office so tons of people moved out to NJ and upstate NY and the city was just dead.</p>
<p>Currently in Panama City, FL. Last night I went to a restaurant that was packed full sat next to strangers at a bar served by employees with no masks. I can go into any store not masked and no one bats an eye. Only people masking are getting out of cars with NY or other license plates from northern states. There's even schools in the area that allow kids to go maskless. Insane. </p>
<p>It's a day and night difference between the places.</p>

        <p>Here in Washington DC we are required to wear masks in all indoor settings. I refuse to wear one while outside &amp; only wear mask beneath my nose while inside public places like stores. Montgomery County MD is even more strict &amp; isn’t allowing bars to serve drinks after 10pm. DC, despite its demographics, was never hit as hard as other areas like NYC NJ &amp; MI, yet lockdown measures have been equally strict &amp; archaic. We hope for things to open properly ASAP, but there are many here who “trust the science” too much and grovel over Dr Fraudci. It’s nauseating - all the Thank You Dr Fauci signs are hard to miss as well - puke.</p>

        <p>I am in Alberta (calgary ) we just went back to phase 1 so no indoor dining , library’s closed, gyms only open for 1:1 training. Now they have changed the reopening plan to vaccine numbers instead of hospitalization numbers so they can keep this going on forever. The one positive is they have kept schools open so far.</p>

Masks still mandatory in public transport and stores they tried to make them mandatory outside but thank God that didn't go through. A lot of propaganda about vaccines and they are about to close all cafes and bars again after opening them about a month ago. We are basically in an infinite loop of opening everything and then closing it back down.</p>
