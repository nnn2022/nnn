    <strong>A open letter</strong>
    <p><p>No one is happy. No one wants to wear an annoying piece of cloth. No one likes lockdowns or massive unemployment. Look at Australia, they listened and wore masks (over the nose unlike you neaderthals) and are living their lives as if nothing happened. </p>
<p>No where in the constitution does it mention masks. Feel free to read it. wHaT aBoUt tHe aDa. First of all, the ADA isn’t a constitutional amendment go back to history class. Second, the ADA doesn’t protect people with medical conditions who can cause harm to individuals. Same reason why if your service dog (real or not) decides to bite someone the owner now has the right to refuse service. No your seasonal allergies don’t exempt you from wearing a mask. If you have a severe enough (real) condition like COPD you should be extra careful wearing a mask like it’s your religion and staying at home unless you are about to starve and die. bUt iT tRaPs bAcTeRiA. Wait until you find out about air pollution. </p>
<p>Now onto vaccines. The reason why you can step on a rusty nail and not die. The reason why iron lungs went out of fashion. The reason why your parents let you eat dirt and you made it to adulthood. So lets go over some basic chemistry for the slower ones. There has been no link to vaccines and autism. Autism is genetic which means its passed down from your parents before a child is vaccinated. Autism, like many other mental disorders were highly stigmatized and misunderstood. Which is why the number of diagnosed autistic kids have skyrocketed. wHaT aBoUt mErCuRY. First of all pure mercury and thimerosal (what’s in vaccines) are two completely different elements. For the scientifically illiterate, Thimerosal is a mercuric derivative of thiosalicylic acid used as a preservative in vaccines, cosmetics, tattoo inks, eye drops and contact lens solutions as well as a disinfectant. According the FDA vaccines have the same amount of mercury as a can of tuna fish. Your going to risk killing your child over this. tHe vAcCiNe wAs rUsHeD. No it wasn’t the vaccine went through all the proper steps such as human and animal trials to make sure it’s safe. You know what fine don’t get the vaccine. bUt cHeMiCaLs. Ooohh scary chemicals. You know what is a chemical, dihydrogen monoxide better ban water. Oh and the side effects literally every medication on the planet has death as a side effect. Tylenol can kill you. The benefits outweigh the cost. Oh and your religious exemption is bullshit you can’t do harm to your kid because your schizophrenia I mean god said so. </p>
<p>There is a reason why people stare at you and harass you when you choose not to wear a mask. You aren’t a martyr or non conformist you are the annoying village idiot that needs to get off of social media. The 16 year old cashier who can’t even vote you are yelling at wishes you would just drop dead so they don’t have to listen your conspiracy bullshit for the third time today. You’re a sheep who needs to stop listening to your mentally retarded uncle who dropped out of high school. Can you tin foil hats go back to denying the moon landing while the adults discuss policy. Question everything, accept the answers. 
Thank you,
A mentally sane person.</p></p>

        <p>I listened I understand your frustration we are all frustrated. Some arguments make sense like why shut down every business and give a $600 pity check. I agree the government has done an abysmal job at handling this. I am just saying this would be over if people had common sense and  wore masks for ten minutes while getting their milk.</p>

<li>May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</li>
<li>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</li>
<li>A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medince found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</li>
<li>A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</li>
<li>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</li>
<li>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn’t reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that “the evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks”, but supports the use of masks by “particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</li>
<li>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</li>
<li>An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591</li>

        <p>It's PhD as it's short for the two words of philosophiae doctor or known as a doctor of philosophy. And masks are known to cause serious health problems in children . I find the idea of adults sacrificing the health and wellbeing of children to save themselves utterly reprehensible.</p>

        <p>You wrote it as if it was one word (Phd) not two (PhD) and that's the error here. Regarding the study that's a very disingenuous way to look at it. We are not all going to die as covid is less that 1% fatal. However, all children will suffer particularly in regards to education. As education is positively associated with longevity, children being educated in covid times should expect a reduction in their life expectancy.</p>
<p>To put your own wellbeing ahead of that of a child is the height of selfishness or as the authors of the study say " adults need to collecticely reflect the circumstances under which they would be willing to take a residual risk upon themselves in favor of enabling children to have a higher quality of life without having to wear a mask".</p>

        <p>i used my stimulus check to have my lawyer update my will to reflect my deepest, sincerest desire to never be put on a ventilator for any respiratory virus. when it's my time to go, it's my time to go. she said i have one of the most explicit Advanced Medical Directives and Do Not Resuscitate orders that she's ever written.</p>
<p>my loved ones will never have to worry about the cost of my stay in a hospital because if i'm that sick, pump my ass full of drugs and let me die peacefully and quietly. i will never live on a ventilator. i will never be a vegetable. and i will never ask my family to make those hard decisions.</p>
<p>have you ever seen someone die, fuckmcdonalds? held your loved one's hand in their last moments? changed their diaper or catheter? sat shiv with a half-dead body in the shadows while they barter their way across the river of the dead to the other side? no? maybe you should before you go spouting off on the virtue of ventilators and intubation.</p>

        <p>I have actually, its the most painful thing in the world that becomes more and more probable each day for everyone. Wouldn’t you do everything you could to stop it. Yes you could do everything by the books and still get it. My question is would you jump out of a plane with 1% death rate. Wear a mask even if it was just 1% effective (its a lot higher than that) thats still something.</p>

        <p>oh man i have bad news for you lol but i will definitely go skydiving at some point in my life and it's definitely more dangerous than covid-19.</p>
<p>so yeah, i'd jump out of the plane. probably up to 5% death rate. and if it weren't a pleasure jump - if it were life or death, like a plane violently crashing, you bet your sweet ass i'd jump out of the plane.</p>
<p>oh and i totally would have taken on the terrorists on flight 93 and brought that plane down in a field in Pennsylvania, knowing it would bring me to my death. live free or die trying.</p>
<p>nope, i won't do anything to stop death. such is the circle of life. matter cannot be destroyed, it simply takes another form. you begin to die the moment you take your first breath. your mother gives you life and death.</p>

        <p>Wow yall are terrible at math. The death rate for skydiving is 1 per 167000 jumps or .0006%. Comparing that to 1% death rate 1 out of 100. So skydiving is a lot safer than corona.</p>

        <p>Y’all is in the merriam webster dictionary which mean it’s a word. Its a conjugation of you and all. It’s just as valid as don’t or shouldn’t. Do better. This isn’t about dying you realize that coronavirus even in healthy 30 year olds leaves lung scarring which could affect your health later on. Or you could end up in the hospital with thousands of dollars in bills. Have fun with that or you could wear a mask.</p>

        <p>so does the flu! so does the common cold! so does pneumonia! hell a sinus infection can fuck you up real good. organ scarring is a thing your body is supposed to do! it's not the best, but hey, who am i to argue with evolution?</p>
<p>i cannot live my life in fear of one virus. there are literally thousands of other things that will probably kill me first. i have a better chance of dying in childbirth but yet my idiot husband and i keep trying to get knocked up for some godforsaken reason.</p>
<p>also i literally just said i have an AMD/DNR that will prevent those absurd bills because i've already thought about it and i don't want to live as a vegetable. </p>
<p>have fun wearing your mask. we'll be here in the land of the living when you're ready to come re-integrate. or not whatever, your funeral.</p>

        <p>I had a loved one die from covid back when Spain and Italy were getting the shit kicked out of them.</p>
<p>Everyone will lose someone from covid.</p>
<p>I don't just change my mind about things because I'm affected.</p>
<p>I'm not one of those superficial assholes who go their whole lives not giving a fuck about cancer and the taking up the cause the second it affects me.</p>
<p>I've had more people close to me die than you will likely ever experience.</p>
<p>The fact that all you have is "you don't care because you've never been affected by this" is horrid projection on your part and really goes a long way toward showing how vapid your character is.</p>

        <p>My personal metric, low new number of cases and herd immunity from the vaccine. In the US we are so far down the rabbit hole a vaccine is the only option. Which the number keeps changing but the last I heard was 80% has to be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>lol thank god for that, could you imagine how overpopulated that continent would be if it hadn't? jfc, blessing in disguise. survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>honestly, if the people of medieval europe had acted anything like the batshit crazy doomers we're surrounded by today, i would have left every single one of them to die in a heap and lit the pyre on fire.</p>
<p>i'm proud that at least some of my ancestors didn't act like absolute fucking halfwits and managed to survive the plague. they were probably the ones who kept on living their life, just trying to get by. i really hope they left the losers behind to die in a heap. that would bring me great joy and energy. natural selection works, people. </p>
<p>after seeing how people have behaved in 2020, i'm genuinely flummoxed by how humanity survived this long, anyway. we're fucking nutters. we don't deserve to live if we're going to act like this. absolute fucking Howard Hughes crackpots. what a waste.</p>
<p>also like yeah modern medicine is great but we can't cure or stop death, all we can do is delay it. and really, after awhile, how long do you really want to push it off? that's not really living. living hooked up to a machine like a fucking vegetable, or like a fucking bubble boy. lol. also i'm sure that indoor plumbing, fresh water, electricity, etc., went a long way in increasing our life longevity.</p>

        <p>“Thank god for the plagues” wow yall are something special. Btw the bubonic plague ended because everyone was forced to quarantined. Probably would have killed everyone if they had yalls attitude and said fuck it and went out. Today something as simple as an antibiotic would save you from dying from the bubonic plague.

<p>and no, everyone wasn't forced to quarantine indefinitely ad infinitum until the elites decided it was safe enough for them to leave their houses. obviously they got on with it. we wouldn't be here if they hadn't. oh and we would totally have read about it and learned about in what i call history. because some smart person would have been like, "quarantine is a great fucking idea!" and you know how we know it didn't work? because no smart person ever wrote that book, and that's why no one ever tried to lockdown society at large until 2020! THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FROM HISTORY TO SUPPORT THIS ARGUMENT AND THERE STILL ISN'T AND IT DIDN'T WORK.</p>

        <p>The bubonic plague was caused by a type of bacteria genius. Yes there is evidence from history, “The most popular theory of how the plague ended is through the implementation of quarantines. The uninfected would typically remain in their homes and only leave when it was necessary, while those who could afford to do so would leave the more densely populated areas and live in greater isolation.”</p>

        <p>well if it's caused by a bacteria and not a virus, maybe we shouldn't treat SARS-COV-2 like the bubonic plague, since they're completely different things.</p>
<p>and they didn't lock people down indefinitely. where are you getting this? like the max i ever heard was 40 days and we've been locked down for like, 300. and i'm sure they did a fan-fuckin-tastic job keeping everyone in medieval europe inside all the time. i think the rich elite people in medieval europe did a great job staying inside, just like the elites today! fuck the working class - i mean, the serfs! fuck those serfs!</p>

        <p>okay look I'm drunk and going to sleep but there are plenty of other folks on this thread who have replied to you with substantive evidence that masks don't work or that at best, they're ineffective. I'm not going to post all those links. but that research is all over this sub and you don't have to look for it. the short end of a long story is that you're free to wear a mask as long as you want. my body, my choice - and I'm not going to wear a mask ever again when this mass hysteria and psyop is over. you're free to stay home, zoom, never go into the office, mask up, whatever you want. but you don't get to tell me what to do anymore. I'm not going to make you do anything you don't want to do and you're not going to make me do anything I don't want to do. i pay you no bills, i pay you no mind. god bless.</p>

        <p>Good start, now check rates per age. Even with how we're currently counting covid different from every other disease, more kids died of flu than covid last year.</p>
<p>Kids with no immune systems die of flu in huge numbers, but simply don't die of covid. It's almost like they're different diseases!</p>
<p>Then start accounting for the fact that the pcr test, the only indicator that someone might have covid, produces 97% or more false positives at 35ct, and we run 40-42 in most of the western world. So a large portion of those deaths weren't even sick with covid, so the calculated ifr is grossly overstated. Minnesota investigations found at least 40% over counting.</p>
<p>This is why Sweden for example has had a milder year than average despite no lockdowns.  We created scary death numbers that aren't supported by better quality data. </p>
<p>Covid really is quite mild for anyone young or healthy. We're doing horrible things to our populations for something no more severe than a flu.</p>

        <p>Lets look at numbers. Last flu season the number of deaths in children was 188. Trust me I’m not diminishing this number I don’t want children to die obviously . Today the official number is 2373. Lets assume your right only 60% really have covid thats still over 1400 deaths just today. I’m having trouble finding a good source for the total number of childrens death. This is greatly more significant than the flu. Last year there was 34000 deaths for the flu. Your going to have a hard time convincing me that the 400000 died this year from “just the flu”. Lets subtract 400000-34000. Thats 366000 more people who died from the flu. Not buying it will never buy it. I agree the government has done an abysmal job with handling this virus.</p>

        <p>Your numbers seem way off.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm#table1</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html   (70k deaths despite a LOWER infection rate than the previous year)</p>
<p>and from another cdc link:</p>
<p>"For example, even though the reported number of deaths during the 2017-2018 flu season was 188, CDC estimates the actual number was closer to 600. It is likely the actual number of children who died from flu during the 2019-2020 season is higher as well."</p>
<p>covid (the breakdowns are irritatingly different, but)</p>
<p>https://www.heritage.org/data-visualizations/public-health/covid-19-deaths-by-age/</p>
<p>(max 200 &lt; 18, again only using positive pcr to determine covid presence, and counting deaths differently than flu)</p>
<p>We're also now in our second season for covid, the annual death rate does not accumulate.  If it did, flus would be far, far higher on the total count.  The 1969 pandemic flu that was much deadlier is still around every year!</p>
<p>Regardless, if you count every death with a positive pcr test for a cold as necessarily having died of that cold, you skew the results against a direct comparison.  We don't count flu fatalities this way, and never have.  You don't have any data for what covid deaths would be if we used reliable testing and only checked those who weren't otherwise dying of cancer, heart attack, trauma, etc.  (Even the MN investigation was purely on cause-of-death grounds, because we can't asses whether someone actually had covid without running cultures, which best I can find isn't done.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are some 5-6 million US residents in nursing homes, from which 40% of the covid deaths occurred.  The median life expectancy in nursing homes is 5 months.  Over any given year, a HUGE turnover is expected.  If we count every death that had a cold as a covid death (because even without a positive test, per cdc instruction, if covid is suspected it should be written on the death certificate) we'll get a large number of cases that weren't caused by covid, but were caused by whatever got them put in the nursing home in the first place.</p>
<p>Honestly, once we actually get some quality data, I expect we'll see this fall out very much like sars-cov-1.  In some people, it is very much more severe than the flu, and quite dangerous, but in the bulk of the population it's no more severe than a cold, a very much bimodal distribution of severity.  We've scared everyone because it CAN be bad (like brain-eating amoebas!) but that is so incredibly rare in healthy individuals (and those already seriously ill would have had a rough time with any disease, including the flu) that it shouldn't affect us day-to-day.  It's because of the crazy "if you can blame covid, blame covid"  mortality accounting and incentivization (here's money for every covid patient and death!) and "use a million pcr cycles and poor methodology" that make it look like it's everywhere and in everyone.</p>

        <p>ICUs being filled to capacity happens every year at around this time. Aside from the British NHS, which actually panics about it to the press every winter, it's not talked about because it's a fact of life. But if it's a problem we want to address, why not increase the capacity instead if resorting to fascistic lockdown mandates?</p>

<p>Before I stop annoying the piss out of you for the night, I just want to give you a little bit of our perspective. We aren't just pissed off because we can't get haircuts or have to wear masks. The problem is this hysteria seems like a cynical power grab by our "social betters" who can't even follow their own guidelines. Assholes like Gavin Newsom think they have the right to ruin their people's lives and treat them like prisoners, then they turn around and go to fancy French restaurants with their friends without even wearing masks. If they, who have the experts at their beck and call, don't seem to be scared of the virus, why should we? Not to mention rallies and celebrations which are agreeable to the Democratic Party being acceptable, but going to the beach warrants police brutality, apparently, according to doomer assholes on Reddit. So you'll have to excuse me if I don't believe my social betters are acting in good faith.</p>
<p>And another thing, the government never seems to want to give up newly gained powers after emergencies. They didn't after 9/11 and I really fucking doubt they'll do it this time.</p>
<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist if you want, I don't care. Maybe they shouldn't act so fucking shady for a change.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your perspective. My anger isn’t just to one party or another. Look I live in rural Texas so my perspective on this matter is I’ll admit probably really skewed. But every time i go to walmart (for necessities once a week) there is always some family not wearing a mask someone causing a scene with the cashier. I’ve had it. I’m mad at congress for playing politics for 7 months and doing nothing. I’m done with the antimaskers I’m done I want to go back to normal. I just want people to cover their damn faces and I don’t think thats to much to ask for.</p>

        <p>Oh are you the boss of gofundme now?</p>
<p>See....you expose yourself.  You don't "care" about anyone or anything.  You just get off on telling people what to do.</p>
<p>You somehow didn't get them memo where you couldn't tell me to wear a mask and hide in my house but now you are going to tell me not to do something else.  I will if I damn well want to.</p>
<p>You know why this will never end? Because the propaganda says if we just shelter in place, covid will just go away.  But covid will be around forever. It mutates and creates new strains of itself.  It is not going away, ever, so either learn to live with it or spend the rest of our lives locked down.</p>
<p>I choose to live.  Feel free to try and keep me from doing so but, I'll just treat you like a three year old and move on with my life.</p>

        <p>Which state? Obviously New York or California is going to have higher rates then Idaho. What does mRna stand for. Your not going to scare me with using scientific words you don’t know. Every drug is “experimental” when it is first released. There hasn’t been a long term study because it was just released and we unfortunately do not have a time machine.

<p>Yes but with vaccines it takes 8-15 years and they should do a long term study instead of rolling it out and how am I gonna have confidence in a covid vaccine where we don’t even know the long term effects of it and the fact their exempt from liabilities</p>

        <p>I'll bite, let's discuss a bit.</p>
<p>&rt;Look at Australia</p>
<p>Feel free to look at Australia all you'd like. Every country and different and needs to handle this kn their own way. Australia's solution will be different from India's will be different from the United States'.</p>
<p>&rt;over the nose unlike you neaderthals</p>
<p>Feel free to also bitch at all the pro-mask people who also wear their mask improperly, improperly store it, incessantly touch it, and/or wear a quality that's not truly effective.</p>
<p>&rt;No where in the constitution does it mention masks.</p>
<p>I'm not all that into bringing up the Constitution, and I don't know all that much about it, so I won't even say that mask mandates violate it. But I have to imagine that it doesn't need to specifically mention each and every thing that it supports.</p>
<p>&rt;you should be extra careful wearing a mask like it’s your religion and staying at home unless you are about to starve and die.</p>
<p>(What you should be doing if you're so terrified and paranoid of this weak as fucm virus.)</p>
<p>Hell, I have asthma (yes, for real), and I'm much more concerned about secondhand smoke than I am of this virus. Let me make the choice.</p>
<p>&rt;Now onto vaccines</p>
<p>As far as vaccines, I'm not some "anti-vaxxer". I'm totally fine with vaccines and recognize their use. I don't see a reason I need to take this vaccine though, I'm healthy and in my 20s. Protect the vulnerable and take any and all personal precautions necessary to make you feel safe. Someone of my age and health doesn't have a need to take the vaccine, wear a mask, socially distance, lockdown, etc. Save it for the vulnerable.</p>
<p>&rt;For the scientifically illiterate, Thimerosal is a mercuric derivative of thiosalicylic acid</p>
<p>"For the scientifically illiterate, here's a sentence that the Average Joe doesn't understand whatsoever, which I'll use to make it sound like I'm smart and you're all the biggest idiots on the planet."</p>
<p>&rt;You know what fine don’t get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Hey, thanks, finally.</p>
<p>&rt;better ban water</p>
<p>You trying to make my case for me?</p>
<p>&rt;Oh and the side effects literally every medication on the planet has death as a side effect. Tylenol can kill you.</p>
<p>And is anyone genuinely concerned about death as a direct result of these? No. If they are, they can feel free not to take the medication. Same applies to many aspects of this pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;The benefits outweigh the cost.</p>
<p>Just like the result of actually opening things back up again and letting people live their lives.</p>
<p>&rt;There is a reason why people stare at you and harass you when you choose not to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Correct. Not because they know all about "mercuric derivative of thiosalicylic acid", but because they're been fully conditioned by media, social media, and people in their circles to be terrified. There's a tremendous amount of fear porn waiting around every corner at every second.</p>
<p>&rt;the annoying village idiot that needs to get off of social media.</p>
<p>You'll find that many here rarely use any form of social media. Most of what's on there is very pro-mask, pro-lockdown content. So I don't really know what you're even getting at. We're dumb cause we use social media, even though the people who use social media the most are incredibly pro-mask and pro-lockdown?</p>
<p>&rt;you are yelling at</p>
<p>Lol wayyyy more instances of people berating someone because they simply don't have a mask, rather than the other way around. No one here cares if you wear a mask. Feel free. It's the other side that's so insistent that everyone be as terrified, paranoid, and intolerant as they are.</p>
<p>&rt;conspiracy bullshit</p>
<p>Conspiracy bullshit like "Protect the vulnerable, and if you're so afraid, stay home and take any and all personal precautions in order to feel safe"?</p>
<p>&rt;You’re a sheep</p>
<p>Because we're skeptical of the "cure" being worse than the virus at this point? Because we don't blindly accept what's been fed to us by media and social media?</p>

        <p>Ok great thanks for responding. Australia was just an example. I’ll admit poor example since it’s isolated I should have used Japan very densely populated but they know how to wear masks so they are back to “normalish”. I agree wearing it improperly makes it useless but so is not covering your nose. I also have asthma too and it has gotten a lot better since wearing masks. I am contemplating wearing it after I am vaccinated just because the place I live is so dusty. I disagree that people are more rude to antimaskers than vice versa. The employees have to ask you to wear a mask or else they will get shut down and loose their jobs. I would be upset at loosing my livelihood over some guy is being a jerk and can’t wear a mask for 5 minutes. Being skeptical is good. Question everything but when you see and answer from a reputable source accept it.</p>

<p>Of course. But if you really wanted to help some people out, I think you'd have a much easier time making your case to the masses who essentially render their masks useless, but think they're protected and doing a great deed for humanity.</p>
<p>&rt;I am contemplating wearing it after I am vaccinated just because the place I live is so dusty.</p>
<p>Hey, feel free. Again, I don't really mind, live your life. I'd wear some sort of mask as well if it was so dusty. Likewise for air pollution.</p>
<p>&rt;I disagree that people are more rude to antimaskers than vice versa.</p>
<p>You seen all these subs on Reddit that are essentially devoted to harassing/encouraging the harassing of those who don't wear a mask? It's insane. The norm in society revolves around all these mandates, and the vast majority of people wear masks for at least a large portion of their day. Who's the one that's going to get picked on? The one who is different. I think it's hard to have an overt target for your anger if you're that pissed about people wearing masks, unkess someone has just been pushed to their breaking point.</p>
<p>People who are against masks often don't care if others do, and just want to carry on living their life. Whereas on the flip side, it's becoming mainstream to demonize someone if they don't constantly wear a piece of cloth on their face that may or may not even be helping. So when they're spotted by the masses, I can see them being an easy, overt target. Plus the whole masks = anonymity thing.</p>
<p>Obviously there's no empirical data on it or anything, and every side likes to think they're the good guys, but just some thoughts.</p>
<p>&rt;The employees have to ask you to wear a mask or else they will get shut down and loose their jobs.</p>
<p>Depends on where you work, I suppose. People are assholes, and I'm sure it happens, but masks being required to enter are to be expected at most places now. Should think there aren't that many people who are gonna lose it on someone at this point.</p>
<p>&rt;I would be upset at loosing my livelihood over some guy is being a jerk and can’t wear a mask for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>I should hope no one's losing their job because they asked someone to wear a mask and they refused to comply. Not much you can do about that as the employee. But if it happened, losing your job because of one bad apple also wouldn't be as big of a deal if things weren't shut down.</p>
<p>&rt;Question everything but when you see and answer from a reputable source accept it.</p>
<p>I highly agree on questioning everything, especially in today's day and age. But there are many reputable sources in play, and also many biases in play. You also obviously have to interpret those sources, and see how they can realistically be applied to the current situations. Kind of like how I could look at all the car-related incidents in the world and say "Wow, cars are terrible, we need to ban them all yesterday!" - but we both know that's silly and wouldn't ever happen.</p>

        <p>I agree the improper use is just as bad if not worse than no use. However you have to look at the statistics. Why is america doing such a bad job? I’ve see so many people just look at any r_publicfreakout and you see antimaskers losing their mind over wearing a mask. I saw one where this dude called the worker a fat cow for just doing her job. I would be more sympathetic to antimaskers if they would just be like oh you are refusing service let me eat somewhere else instead of screaming off their top of their lungs. For example if I were to not wear shoes its not harming anyone but I would still get refused service. The owner wouldn’t be demonizing me instead just using their rights. It’s not just losing their job. In my city a business could be shut down for 30 days if someone is not wearing a mask even if they kicked them out and refused service. I don’t see how its fair for a company to have to suffer for individuals choices.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why is america doing such a bad job?</p>
<p>It's far from nust the US that's having an issue though. It's been nearly a year of all these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns that clearly aren't working, and have likely caused more harm than good at this point.</p>
<p>&rt;I would be more sympathetic to antimaskers if they would just be like oh you are refusing service let me eat somewhere else</p>
<p>That's the majority of them though. Reddit obviously amplifies any of these things, and often conflates one bad apple with an entire group of people. Most anti-maskers don't mind, realize it's up to the business (as it should be), and will move on. Or they'll realize it's their only option and just grin and bear it. Just like if we opened up, pro-maskers could do the same thing with places that up to their standards of safety and sanitation, right?</p>
<p>&rt;if I were to not wear shoes its not harming anyone but I would still get refused service.</p>
<p>Correct, and a business should have every right to do so, for whatever reason(s) they see fit. If you don't like it, you can always go elsewhere, right? I think the same should apply to masks. I also don't think the government should be mandating that people wear shoes absolutely everywhere they go, regardless of what they're doing. That said, I'm sure the reasonings and liabilities behind refusing service due to no shoes versus no mask are different.</p>
<p>&rt;a business could be shut down for 30 days if someone is not wearing a mask even if they kicked them out and refused service.</p>
<p>Sounds like it's an issue with your city's government. That's quite silly for them to do such a thing, seeing as the business can't really do anything about that. More reason to lift the mandates, I'd say.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that shutting down our economy with literally no safety net was the worst thing the government could do. It’s not just reddit I literally have to kick out an antimasker everyday at my work who is screaming and yelling. I’m over it but you see how me potentially losing my job if someone comes in without a mask and we get shut down is way worse than covering your face for 30 mins max. I also don’t have health insurance if I’m in the hospital I could literally go bankrupt. I’m just done with everything I know we all are but can we just wear a mask.</p>

        <p>No, we don't.  I'm of the opinion they are doing more harm than good.  In fact, we were <em>told</em> that, not long ago.  And it makes sense in a lot of ways.  In this very thread u/WogBoyAnthony cited 11 studies indicating that mask wearing was at best negligible in regards to transmission, and in some cases actually worsening the situation.  I haven't read or studied each and every one of those studies, but I <em>have</em> looked at some and they seem credible.  Not everyone agrees within the scientific community and if you are an honest person you will acknowledge that.  Here in California the mask mandates are some of the strictest, and I seldom see people indoors without one (almost never), yet the alleged 'cases' seem to be on the rise.  If you said that's because people aren't wearing them right, <em>then</em> you and I would find common ground, but the fact is, people don't and won't wear them correctly, they pull them down, they wear them too long, they cause people to touch their faces more often etc.  That's just the fact of the matter, I see it all the time.  So, no, wearing masks by the general population, most of whom are <em>not</em> sick, is <strong>not</strong> good.  It's actually bad.  We should <strong>stop</strong> wearing them, for the greater good.</p>
