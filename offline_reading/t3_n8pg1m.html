        <p>Sweden has had relaxed measures since the beginning, compared to the other nordic countries they have had about 5 to 10 times the amount of positive, ICU and deaths compared to norway and denmark. And sweden didnt suddenly open, they had more relaxed measures but imposed a bit more restrictions in january/february after critisim of their flaud method of handling covid. Also you neglect to mention denmark which actually resently open and now see a increase in positive covid. Here are some numbers, by end of february norway, denmark and finland has 4331 deaths total(259 per million) and sweden had 12798 deaths in total(1255 per million).</p>

        <p>You said Sweden is struggling with Covid outbreaks. It’s not.  It’s Covid cases are down 37%. That’s contradictory to your comment and also has nothing to do with Norway or Denmark. You also said they are struggling with ICU hospitalization. Again this has nothing to do with any other nation. They have less than 400 people hospitalized in a nation of over 10 million people. These stats prove your comment to be exaggerated</p>

        <p>Comparable to similar nations, like its nabour countries with similar culture, social standards, climate etc. they did not succeed. And yes it has everything to do with comparison, how are you gonna measure impact of restrictions without and controls, I mean what you are saying just absurd. And yes they are down last week, they didn't suddenly do anything special, covid numbers fluctuate for all countries always, they go up then they go down. Only way to make sense of this is to look at the broader picture, not 1 week of numbers.</p>

        <p>so if Covid numbers are going to fluctuate anyway, then what is the point of lockdowns? Your comment made it sound like CURRENTLY Sweden is in the midst of a covid crisis when that is verifiable false based on the CURRENT data out of Sweden. What do you not understand about this? no one is talking about what happened there 8 months ago we are speaking about NOW, as in relation to Texas' numbers. Sweden is not having a surge in cases, hospitalizations, or ICU capacity, regardless of what is happening ANYWHERE else at the current moment.....if your argument is "Sweden couldve done better if they locked down like Norway" then that is a different conversation</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: since you want so badly to compare it countries with controls, look at France and UK. Even within the US, look at locked down states like Michigan compared to open states. Florida has been mostly open since last summer and is 27th in per capita deaths despite having the oldest population average in the US</p>

        <p>Im talking about you correlating lockdown with increase in numbers, which you did earlier, evidently thats not true. Basing this fact on a short amount of time in a single state in the USA isnt exactly HARD evidence, especially when I provide you many other examples of the contrary, even sweden compared to its nabouring countries has higher deaths, ICU and covid positives, it has had that consistently since the beginning, they have been running a different strategy as we all know. Then you shifted the goal post to, "well regardless of their numbers compared to their nabours, its actually not that bad of a number", when thats not the point, its wether lockdown works or not to reduce covid outbreaks.</p>

        <p>All data is based on a short amount of time Bc there’s only 13 months of data to go by. If the point is whether or not lockdowns work, then Florida and Texas destroy your point again. Florida has been open for 10 months and is 27th in per capita deaths despite having the oldest population in the US. They’ve also hosted several large events including the super bowl which haven’t lead to the massive case rise as predicted. NYC was one of the most locked down places on earth and is the Covid epicenter of America. Las Vegas has been pretty open and is a major transient/travel heavy city and is also doing far better than many locked down areas. Since reopening Texas and Tennessee have also not seen surges.</p>

        <p>I think you got an agenda, looking for data which fits your narrative, you are going to find data which fits your narrative. Did you take into account enviromental effects, climate, how many have been vaccinates both 1 and second dose, previous cases due to natural immunity. Cause all these things affects the cases, how would you suggest to take all these variables into account?</p>

        <p>well ill agree that my agenda is the government should stop trying to control every aspect of peoples lives and businesses bc it will lead to unmitigated power over our lives that theyll never relinquish.....however you are so far off topic at this point....The OP  pointed out that  like Texas, Sweden's lack of lockdowns have not produced mass death as predicted, and as a result, the media has stopped talking about Sweden. No one said there wasnt a time when Sweden had a rise in cases or people in the ICU btw.....you then commented that Sweden is struggling with outbreaks and ICU's being inundated, which according to CURRENT data out of Sweden, they are not.....now youre off on a tangent about variables and climate.....the point of the entire thread was that despite being fully open, mass carnage is not happening in Texas, as predicted by the CDC and Biden admin. Numbers in fully open, non-locked down places (such as Texas, Florida, Sweden, Tennessee etc) are no worse off than hard locked down places such as LA, Michigan, UK etc. I dont know how much more clearly i can articulate this point. If youre pro-lockdown just say so and move on</p>

        <p>So just close everything forever until we are 100% certain that no one will ever get sick or die? That’s impossible. Life is inherently a risk. At some point the only way to know what will happen is to open and see. It’s unrealistic to expect guarantees and unrealistic to expect things to be closed until there’s guaranteed safety. It’s impossible. The only people that think this way are people who haven’t missed a paycheck this whole time.</p>

        <p>Nobody want to keep things close forever, but your argument was that keeping things close doesnt help to stop covid. When evidently it does help, I mean you could say there is lack of control data for covid 19, obviously. But we do see a huge reduction in other respiratory diseases, e.g. RS virus which is the main cause of hospitalization among kids is at an all time low, almost no cases in my own country. We do know how respiratory diseases, you need to be in contact with others, that means if you dont meet others, you dont spread it, its absurd to think anything else. So to say lockdown doesnt work, I think is false. Also its not about guaranteed safety, its about keeping the numbers low enough so it doesnt spiral out of control. Some places have seen as high as 18% more deaths in 2020, and that is with lockdowns, that should tell you something about how contagious and dangerous corona is. I personally think lock down should be the last resort, but in some cases it has been necessary.</p>

        <p>It was the first resort though. It’s ongoing and many of the accompanying “rules” are arbitrary. If you think this is only about virus mitigation you’re delusional.</p>

        <p>Is there a reason why my elected leader has bad intentions with these rules? Also they are under the advertisement of various other non governmental institutions. Also its worth mentioning if there was anything that we criticise our government of it was too slow of a reaction, ie. they should have shut down and close the borders faster. Not wait until the pandemic was a fact, more of a reactive response rather than a preemptive one. I mean it makes no sense for the government to want to implement these measures if they don't have to, it only makes them less popular thus less likely to get reelected. we saw what happened to trump, its never good for any current government to have to struggle with any form of crisis. If it was orchestrated, I have no idea what they want to gain from it.</p>

        <p>A) they are expanding their power under the guise of safety, and their voters have bought it, maybe bc they have legitimate fear, maybe bc they hated Trump so much but politicians crave power at least here in the US. Everything the democrats have done the last year regarding covid has expanded their power over citizens lives, all while flouting their own rules. If you think they implement these mandates bc they give a shit about your heath, you are too far gone for me to really reason with and the proof of that is that they constantly break their own rules which tells us they are not in reality all that worried about covid. </p>
<p>b) they will get re-elected again despite this power grab bc many of the places this is going on are democrat strongholds (NYC, Cali, Chicago) and have voted dem for decades and will continue to do so</p>
<p>c) no one said covis itself was orchestrated but they certainly capitalized on the fear and the media rhetoric to seize an opportunity</p>
<p>d) if you think the CDC , the WHO and the teachers unions are "non-governmental" institutions you are dead wrong. </p>
<p>your opinions seem idealistic which is nice but not at all in touch with what is currently happening in the US. I am guessing you are either very young, or not from the US and therefore not too much in touch with its politics currently</p>

        <p>I think you cant separate the ulterior motive from official one, if they were in fact trying to suppress citizen disguising it in the midst of the pandemic, cause there are actually measures that need to be taken. I would more so worry if it continues after the pandemic is actually over. but as we see now things start to open up everywhere now that the pandemic is over, so i guess so much for the conspiracy i guess this one didnt pan out the way people in here portray it to be. New york is democratic state which recently opened so i guess there is that, seems like the government wish to open up and that there is no new normal. There are of course countries which are corrupt and authoritative, I dont think USA is one of them with the exemption trump which has complete lack of respect for the democracy, examples would be Hungary which de facto implemented a dictator for an unlimited time</p>

        <p>Things are starting to open up.....with proof of vaccination in democratic cities which, is indeed, suppression of citizens. Furthermore if they were that worried about Covid spreading they wouldn’t be pushing for massive amounts of immigrants flooding into the country unchecked for covid, especially since they are coming from nations with lackluster healthcare.</p>

        <p>I guess that depends on how they are going to use them. There are already some limitations due to vaccines in place which I think are necessary, e.g. traveling abroad, especially to places with high infection pressure. But domestically there shouldnt be any limitations. That seems to be on par with what countries seem to want to implement, but its a bit speculative atm. since there are no covid passports except maybe in israel.</p>

        <p>Vaccinations + heard immunity would be my guess.</p>
<p>More than 11.3 million Texans have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and over 8.3 million are now fully vaccinated, DSHS said. More than half of all eligible Texans have gotten a dose of vaccine, and about 37% are fully vaccinated.  Which doesn’t even consider how many have built immunity from already having had covid.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask for extended periods of time, touching your mask, saturating your mask with your own hot breath, actually increases the potential to spread illness. You’re basically walking around with a germ magnet stuck to your mouth. I’m willing to bet that a decent amount of people use the same mask every day without washing it.</p>

        <p>Really?? No. As a matter of fact, I don’t think that wearing or not wearing a mask either Increases nor decreases your risk for getting Covid. As someone who hasn’t put on a mask one time since Last March, and who got the blood test for Covid done in April (out of curiosity) and who was also in direct contact with several people late last year (January) who shortly after tested positive, I am still negative for Covid and any antibodies. According to all the info and “statistics” I should have already gotten it, or been dead by now. </p>
<p>Masks, especially cloth ones are known to harbor bacteria, especially after they are used for long periods of time, and after becoming damp. They aren’t sterile, and even if they were, wearing them outside of a sterile environment renders them useless. Moist, damp and dark places, are a breeding ground for bacteria, that’s why clothes ( made of cloth) left in a washer for extended periods of time, begin to smell like mildew. </p>
<p>What do you you think is going to happen when someone walks around, sweating, coughing, and leaving spit droplets while talking, on the inside of their mask, then takes it off, to sit down at a restaurant to eat, touches the table, chairs, their face, then puts the mask back on? They have just put themselves at a higher risk of getting sick by trapping who knows what in between their face and the mask, and then breathing that in. not to mention the bacteria already on the mask from outside contaminates that they have held onto.</p>

        <p>There was no massive reduction in influenza. 
Every person with flu like symptoms was classified as covid. </p>
<p>If we just saw a reduction in flu cases I may agree with you that anti-covid measures helped reduce the flu counts. </p>
<p>When we see the flu basically entirely eliminated , it’s obviously bullshit. 
Instead of looking at the obvious truth , we get this runaround “oh oh that’s because covid is so much more contagious!”.</p>
<p>It all contradicts itself. Apparently we totally fucked up and didn’t lock down hard enough or wear enough masks, but our behavior was good enough to eliminate the flu ?  All those anti-maskers somehow avoided it ? </p>
<p>Covid is real, I am not doubting that. I don’t believe in it’s severity and I don’t believe that the flu was magically eliminated by people haphazardly wearing homemade and cheap cloth masks for a year.</p>

<p>You must not be aware of how "flu-deaths" are recorded.  When a person dies of the flu, with a co-morbidity, the co-morbidity is listed as the cause of death, not influenza.</p>
<p>With COVID, it's the opposite.  If you get run over by a car, or die of a heart attack, if a trace of covid is there, you died of COVID.</p>
<p>Isn't that strange?  Why would they do such a thing?</p>
<p>Now knowing this information, wouldn't it be fairly easy to inflate the severity of a "pandemic" with a small, yet simple switcheroo?</p>

        <p><a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/man-who-died-in-motorcycle-crash-counted-as-covid-19-death-in-florida-report">Here's one</a></p>
<p>But more importantly, <a href="https://week.com/2020/04/20/idph-director-explains-how-covid-deaths-are-classified/">here is the reason why</a> car crashes, gunshot wounds, heart attacks, cancer, old age and pretty much anything under the sun can be called a covid death in the US. Even people with "clear alternate causes of death" can be classified as a covid death based on nothing more than a positive lab test.</p>
<p>But it gets worse. Not only is it possible to misclassify based on the loose definition of 'covid death', it is <em>incentivized</em> for US hospitals to classify deaths as covid since they are given large monetary bonuses for <em>every single 'covid death'.</em></p>
<p>https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4897385/user-clip-cdc-director-acknowledges-inflation-covid-19-death-count</p>
<p>While in the UK, their definitions are even looser.</p>
<p>https://www.bbc.com/news/health-53722711</p>
<p><em>"In England, there was no time limit. Someone who recovered from Covid-19 in March and died in a car crash in July would have been counted as a coronavirus death."</em></p>
<p>There's no two ways about it. With these standards in place, covid deaths <em>are</em> clearly inflated to the point of fraud. They are simply reclassifying otherwise "normal" deaths, and that is why the average age of covid death is the same as the average life expectancy in the US, Canada, and UK. They're all using similar methods of "counting" as per the WHO.</p>

<p>You're not going to win any battles here because you dont know the subject matter. Why dont you go back to r/topmindsofreddit and circlejerk for a while to massage the bruised ego.</p>

        <p>In recent times that has been the goal. But herd immunity has existed since the first infections of living things. It’s a biological concept, not a human invention. It’s going to happen no matter what unless the disease in question is so deadly it just wipes a species off the planet. Thankfully, this coronavirus mutation is not that deadly. </p>

        <p>Given the near universal failure of politicians this year, I think it is strategically wise to reward and encourage “good behavior” by politicians today. It does not excuse their past failures, but the past can’t be changed (and no, just “getting rid of them all” sadly isn’t an option). The best that can be done is to reward desired behavior going forward in the hopes that it will continue and spread to other politicians. That does not mean forgiving or forgetting in any way, and you should do neither; positive reinforcement is just basic training for good behavior in the future. </p>
<p>It’s not fair, it’s a terrible situation, but it is what it is - at least until there is some drastic change.</p>

        <p>Isn’t it possible that Texans reached herd immunity through natural means? It is possible if we hadn’t been taking precautionary measures that a lot more deaths would have happened all at once. Instead the deaths were spread out over months. Just a thought.</p>

        <p>No. In 2000 if the hospitals exploded like they did in 2020 (Wuhan, NYC, Italy) and this year (India)- things probably would have gone down a similar path. </p>
<p>I mean, swine flu almost worried the world in 2009... but hospitals didn’t experience major issues and we ended up ignoring it. SARS ended up being the flu that was more severe- ignored that too. </p>
<p>Covid is just so easily transmissible. My neighbors just had their own mini super spreader event- everyone in the garage (5-6 people) got the ‘rona. They were the non believers. I think they believe now, spoke with one of them and he said that for a little bit he was worried.</p>

        <p>Hospitals “explode” almost every year - you just don’t pay any attention to it. </p>
<p>Completely overwhelmed? Patients in halls? Temporary facilities set up for overflows? No room for dying patients? Nurses and doctors exhausted? </p>
<p>Google “hospitals overwhelmed [literally any year of your choice]” and you will find news stories nearly <em>identical</em> to what we’ve seen this past year.  </p>
<p>The fact that most people either never noticed those situations or don’t recall them doesn’t mean that what’s happened this past year is unprecedented. Perhaps in the scale of the problem, sure, but given that “overwhelmed hospitals” are a local issue, there’s no substantive difference between it happening in 20 locations or in 200 locations in a given year. Oh, and <em>most</em> hospitals actually weren’t overwhelmed to any significant degree (and for some, they were overwhelmed as a result of their own choices to reduce staff, which thereby reduces available beds) - just like almost all of those field hospitals that we spent over a billion dollars on were a complete fucking waste (most closed without seeing ANY patients, and very few - if any - saw more than a few dozen patients). </p>
<p>This is just irresponsible reporting combined with ignorance about what regularly occurs during flu seasons. </p>
<p>I’d be happy to entertain evidence that contradicts me here, and change my position as appropriate, but evidence of <em>some</em> hospitals being overwhelmed won’t cut it because that happens every year. If you have evidence that significantly more hospitals were overwhelmed this year than in other years - in the form of hard data, not dramatic quotes from nurses - then I would genuinely appreciate seeing it.</p>

        <p>I believe the surge in hospital visits could easily be explained by the fear lingering of the media. Everyone who had so much as a scratchy throat rushed to the hospital because they were afraid they were dying.</p>

        <p>Also these were young people, healthy. And one of them was sick enough to feel worried. I’m not trying to scare anyone. But it’s highly contagious, more so than the common flu. </p>
<p>Denying that is also denying that Covid has still killed so many people despite the fact that we have been taking precautions this whole time. It was the third highest cause of death in 2020. The flu is never that high. </p>
<p>Denying doesn’t change anything though, it just makes you all seem scared (understandable, change is hard) or unintelligent.</p>

        <p>I’m honestly just interested in why people feel this way. My dad was going down that QAnon hole for a little bit and this sub has a similar feel to it. If anyone could give me any good arguments that make me agree, I could understand a little bit more. But it’s just not happening.</p>

<p>Those 20% were most likely higher risk of developing strong symptoms if they caught it and would get tested. The rest of the 80% are either waiting for the vaccine themselves and being careful or low risk so even if they got the virus, might not develop serious symptoms and get tested</p>
<p>Plus there is a portion of people who even if they got sick, wouldn't get tested unless they needed medical help just so they can point to the stats that says numbers are dropping.</p>

        <p>For dozens of reasons. But mainly so you can confirm you are or aren't contagious. And if you are contagious, inform others you have been in contact with, so they have the information to make decisions as they see fit. Perhaps those decisions lead to one less person getting the virus which gets us back normal as fast as possible. And obviously you make the decisions as you see fit and hopefully you are a responsible member of our society and make decisions that also lead to less people getting sick and us getting back to normal as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>There is a big difference between not having symptoms and not needing medical help.  If you didn't have symptoms, there is obviously no need as it would be luck to even decide to test at the right time. The original comment was medical help though and you can have bad symptoms but not need to go to a doctor about it. </p>
<p>But don't know where you get the .7% from. From what I see though yes you are 75% less likely to pass on the virus if you have no symptoms vs symptoms. But that's just simple logic. Have symptoms means sweating, coughing, etc so more chance to spread the virus.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If you don’t think you have it, then there’s no need to get tested. The fallacy of asymptomatic transmission caused a lot of people to get tested when there was no reason for it. There were also a lot of false positives from those tested as well</p>

        <p>That point still stands. If you’re not sick enough to go to a doctor, then there is no reason to get tested, just stay home and ride it out. If you have a runny nose and slight cough, would you go to the doctor for that? If you’re asymptomatic there’s definitely no reason to go and if you’re not sick enough to need a doctor then it’s best to just stay home and ride it out. I think the responsible thing to do would be to contact people you’ve been around and let them know that you’re not feeling well. For most people, covid is no worse than a cold or run of the mill allergies. I live in a place where allergens are particular bad most of the year and well over half of the population here suffers from allergies. How overwhelming would it be if every person with the sniffles went to get tested?</p>

        <p>As long as you inform other people you aren't feeling well, that's good enough. But also don't use stats about covid numbers dropping going forward when you know you are okay with people not reporting and that is a driver of cases going down being misrepresented.</p>

        <p>The case numbers should  have never been that high to begin with. If the media hadn’t drummed up so much fear, most people would have just don’t the logical thing and stayed home if they didn’t feel well. Instead they all rushed to the hospital fearing they would die from covid</p>

        <p>To prove the virus isn't so bad, wouldn't you want the case numbers to be all accounted for? </p>
<p>If people for example only followed your logic and got tested if they needed to go the hospital fatality rates would be crazy high. You need the people with less symptoms to be positive tests to drive the fatality rate down to make a point.</p>

        <p>What we would really want is the most accurate information. If testing less people would give us more accurate information then that would definitely be preferable. The flu is really a prevalent virus, but most people who get the flu don’t go to the hospital because they dont need to. The number that we are really interested in is the number of people who need to be hospitalized and the number of people who die. We don’t really care how many have been infected. Same with covid. We know infection rates are going to be relatively high because it’s novel, but what we really care about is how many people have severe covid or fatal covid. Those are the numbers that policy and informed consent should be based on.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say extremely.</p>
<p>But most people who get a positive test ask for a second to confirm. And they also ask for a second if they feel they first negative should be positive. Still a free test available in many places for anyone seeking them.</p>

        <p>Because first it might not be covid. Two if you aren't confirming it's covid, you probably aren't taking the next step and letting others know which pushes us back from getting back to normal by your actions. And 3, not getting your case counted on purpose makes posts like this one stupid. Because you now realize that you have thousands of people who don't get their cases counted and then act smart when they say "the cases are going down so i was right" knowing the cases going down is part of a lie.</p>

        <p>All depends on if you aim is to be a good member of society. I'm also young so not worried of dying but my main purpose of testing would be so i can tell friends and family i am positive and they don't pass it along to others who aren't healthy like me or you. I would feel guilt if i passed it to a friend who passes it to a parent or similar and they get serious symptoms. Do you only worry about things if they affect you for all things?</p>

<p>I never met my friends parent. But if my actions led to her death, i would feel guilt for the pain I caused to my friend and his family. </p>
<p>I also care about other peoples health to an extent. That's why we donate blood and such. Offer up our bone marrow. Because I hope that if me or my family need blood or similar, i will hope someone i never met also cared about other people and donated. So to ask that they care enough to donate but not personally care myself would be hypocritical.</p>

        <p>Huh? </p>
<p>I spelled this out for two comments. I can explain it to you again but i can't understand it for you. </p>
<p>If i practice safe driving and am not at fault for the accident, i wouldn't feel guilty. If we both wore masks and they got sick, i wouldn't feel guilty since I did all i could reasonably do. </p>
<p>I don't live in a world of what ifs. I try and live simply. I follow the golden rule. If i do what's right, I'll never have a reason to feel guilt for anything.</p>

        <p>I can’t wait until years down the road the data comes out that shows it’s actually super unhealthy to inhibit your breathing with a mask while you are suffering from flu like symptoms. </p>
<p>Forever the adage when someone has been sick is to get them fresh air - open windows, get them outside , even move them to a climate with better air. 
What did we do with Coronavirus ? Tell people to sit inside , don’t exercise and inhibit our breathing whenever you are out.</p>

        <p>of course it's totally unrelated to his policy change in fact.. covid numbers are going down because of cdcs and whos policy changes that lightened up on deliberately lying (presuming) on so many cases, especially if they've been vaccinated</p>
<p>now instead of lying about ALL CAUSES and calling them covid, they are lying about vaccine deaths and calling them natural causes</p>

        <p>Visited Texas a week ago for some work. Was so incredibly nice to feel normal again.<br>
Weather was gorgeous and the people were all incredibly friendly. Economy booming. </p>
<p>Where I live it is doom and gloom still with a bunch of people congratulating themselves on their vaccines while they wear a mask and talk about new variants. </p>
<p>Our state finally lifted the requirement for masks outside in non-crowded areas but I’m one of the few that doesn’t wear one when walking outside. I think these people genuinely love the fear and feeling like they are a part of something. </p>
<p>If I didn’t have family obligations where I am, Texas would be at the top of my list for relocation.</p>

        <p>All i can say is that while true and important, mixing up ways to present information...."2/3 Raccoons are 20x more likely to transfer rabies 35% of the time." Is confusing to some and not easily understood quickly</p>
<p>Stick to one (multiples, fractions or percentages) and present it in a  relative way.</p>

        <p>Cases in texas were trending strongly downward before the restrictions were lifted. Opening up the state did not lower cases, other measures did. Exactly which measures worked and which didn't will be argued for a long time yet though</p>

        <p>The only reason cases were trending downward anywhere is because guidance was changed to lower the cycles on PCR tests. The cases have been phony all along. They were false positives. You were duped. I still can’t believe this fact got brushed aside.</p>
