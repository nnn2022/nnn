    <strong>Anyone else concerned that masks and such are going to be a permanent fixture ?</strong>
    <p><p>This kinda started bothering me the other day when I was visiting my mother and brother to go out to eat. My mother was slow about taking her mask off back in the car and I jokingly asked if she was still gonna wear it after all this was finally done and she seriously answered “probably”. </p>
<p>I didn’t say anything else altho she fully knows how I feel about this but...ugh. I know there’s a lot more people with the same or more aggressive stance than my mother. </p>
<p>(I’m just glad she doesn’t wear nor ask me to do so when I’m over there otherwise I’d probably stop going).</p></p>

<p>They don't just change the infrastructure of every goddamn supermarket and store by installing those fucking plexiglass barriers and ridiculous "distancing" markings on the floor for "just two weeks."</p>
<p>It was beyond obvious that this bullshit was a permanent thing.</p>

        <p>I remember when people here berated me for saying what you just said. They said, "It's not permanent! Clearly, they will just take that shit down when this is over. Fuck you!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a local shopping center I go to put up stone placards all over the walls that demand masks and "6 feet apart". Stone placards that can't be removed easily. Yeah, seems permanent to me.</p>

        <p>I didn't think about this, but that's a good point. It's now pretty obvious they couldn't say we would have a year or longer lockdown so they have just kept moving things back more and more. Now they're becoming even more aggressive because most people are either brainwashed or just beaten down.</p>

        <p>I can see a lot of shops and social places asking for them in flu season and be a bit arsey about it rather than having a legal mandate. </p>
<p>I think there will be a lot of social pressure with it too, "we shouldn't have to ask - please wear a mask" or something equally twee in doorways or on posters.</p>
<p>The second I can I'll be slinging mine in the bin and not looking back.</p>

        <p>It's actually unenforceable as they aren't allowed to ask for private medical information.  Refusing access to anyone who is exempt would be in contravention of of the Equality Act 2010.  One store already had to pay out a £7000 legal settlement because of this in December, and the way the new store policies are being promoted in the media is misleading so I'm sure there'll be more lawsuits to come.</p>

        <p>Your mom may be wrong and stubborn, but if this is your biggest issue, you may be happier forgiving her. She may shortsighted and afraid, and perpetuating a reality that hurts you, but she likely still loves you and you may be happier just forgiving. Forgiveness is for your own sake, remember that. </p>

        <p>I hope mandates aren’t permanent, as I’d imagine that any politician who tries that won’t be very popular. I know of lots of people who hate wearing them or are just doing it because we have no choice to go anywhere. (Not everyone is on Reddit or other social media all the time or ever.) I’m planing on trashing my masks as soon as my state gets rid of its mandates, and I’ll never wear one again. I won’t go out when I’m sick but I refuse to ever “mask up” again, especially when I’m healthy. I also won’t patronize any business that clings to a mask requirement when the state mandates expire. </p>
<p>If other people are so scared that they need to wear a mask for the rest of their life regardless of how sick they feel (or not), that’s fine. They shouldn’t have the right to make me, though.</p>

        <p>I said it in march and I say it again. I don't think this will go away. It hit me real hard back then. And I'm in depression since then. Life gets worse and worse.</p>
<p>On the other hand... Maybe I was waiting for this "hit". When I had to register for every little stupid thing on the internet I hoped it would change back. When smartphones came and I had to have a google account and a camera in my face everytime I take the phone out I hoped it would change back. When I could not comment on a youtube vid without google account I hoped it would change back. When I had to store a chip in my pocket to ride the train I hoped it would change back. When all I do can used against me some day. I'm just a human.....</p>
<p>I know, I know, I'm 33y old and sound like my granpa talking about the good old days. But honestly I'm terrefied.</p>
<p>It took me a fucking long time to even pay cashless, it took me a long time to get a smartphone, it took me long time to register my life online. I refused most of it and yes, make fun of me. I never pushed my believes or feelings on other ppl. I just didn't do it for a long time. But I can't do so many things anymore when I'm not going with the flow.</p>
<p>What choice do I have? It's how we do things now.</p>
<p>Btw I'm an elektronics technician, I know how silly this sounds. And I kinda know how big this technology industry is. And I had more than a few glimps behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>UK here. After everyone of all ages is offered the vaccine I think the government will have a hard time justifying the mandatory use of masks. Unless they make up newer strains of the virus which won't be affected by the current vaccines they are giving out right now.</p>

        <p>It depends how many of us are actually out there, who will refuse to go to their place of business due to the mask. If they suddenly lose a crap ton of customers, and aren't able to make ends meet, they might start saying it's "suggested" instead of "required" I'm HOPING states like mine will realize that people are migrating so fast outta here to safe states that the gov. Will change his opinion, and change the rules. If the only people left are the poor who can't afford to leave, people on unemployment, illegal immigrants and homeless, there will not be enough people paying taxes by next year to support the state's desire to stay closed.</p>

        <p>It makes perfect sense. They first showed their White superiority by banning face cover to Muslim Women. It wasn't about public places, only about Muslims, after all the obligation to wear a particular form of government approved headgear while driving a motorcycle predates the decision and was never questioned.</p>
<p>Now, the question of the superiority of the West being settled, everyone, including the Muslim Women who were not covering their heads or faces are forced to cover their faces in public, or be fined. Just like in... wait... Saudi Arabia doesn't do that any more.</p>

Its no one's business why you don't want to, and you don't owe them an explanation. Am I right in that's your thinking?

        <p>What makes you say this? There is clear evidence that masks do work... When people wear them (and wear them properly). </p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768533">Here's a study regarding mask use in a Boston hospital </a>that backs up this claim. </p>
<p>Masks are not 100% effective, sure. But they are certainly more effective than no face covering at all. </p>
<p>Saying masks don't work is similar to saying hand washing is ineffective at preventing the spread of various germs. </p>
<p>(Now I'm curious to find out if there were anti-handwashers back in the late 1800s when the importance of hand washing was discovered... My guess would be "Yes")</p>

        <p>This is your clear evidence?</p>
<p>This study is of Healthcare workers, in other words, trained professionals who are required by their employer to wear masks, and who are properly trained how to wear masks and how to maintain proper hygiene. They are also in a hospital setting where strict protocols are already in place to minimize all kinds of infections and contaminations. This is not a setting that is in any way comparable to the population at large. To think what happened to healthcare professionals in a hospital should be expected to happen to average people using old t shirts they roll up in their pockets is just madness.</p>
<p>This test also just cherry picks its date range to get the results it wants. See, massachusetts' first case spike peaked on April 23rd. A state mask mandate wasn't implemented until May 1st. So without widespread mask usage, Massachusetts' cases steadily rose throughout March peaking in late April and steadily decreasing through the summer. In the study, they saw the same increase the rest of the state (as well as the rest of the New England area) saw during what they call the "preinteevention period" from March 1st to March 24th. Then they chose to ignore the next couple of weeks which they call the "transition period". Then from April 11 through 30th, their "intervention period", they saw their decline. They attribute this to masks, but the rest of the state saw this same decline without masks. The same thing happened in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and western Europe. They timed their experiment to coincide with the natural curve of the epidemic. This is a bad study and you should not base your faith in masks upon it. </p>
<p>This is the problem. We are almost a year into this, and this incredibly flawed study from March and April of 2020 is the best evidence you got for masks working? This study is easily refuted with 5 minutes of looking at the actual data and reading their weak methodology. And back in May, this might have been enough to justify trying out masks. But now?!?! Massachusetts has had strict mask mandates since May with high levels of compliance. Yet in the fall, with much more mask usage than they had back in April, they had a massive case spike (almost triple April's spike) that didn't peak til the end of December. Masks did nothing to prevent anything in Massachusetts. And this same exact phenomenon happened in all the same places with similar climates (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Western Europe, etc). The actual, real world evidence clearly shows that masks have no measurable impact on slowing the spread of sars-cov-2. Almost without exception this is the case through out the world. Yet for some reason you have decided to ignore what has actually happened when widespread mask wearing is mandated, and choose to believe weak studies with easily refuted conclusions. Why do you want masks to work so badly? Do you work for a mask company? Its ok to admit that we tired, but masks proved to not have any effect on the spread of this virus. Why keep doubling down? It's strange. </p>
<p>See the difference between washing your hands and wearing masks to prevent viral spread is that there is over a century of accepted science showing the impact hand washing and proper hygiene have on reducing viral spread. It is taught to our children in school. It is common knowledge. Hand washing has been proven to work for generations and that is why it has been recommended by health experts for over 100 years. Masks on the other hand have no such history. The reality is that all the science before 2020 was clear that masks had no measurable impact on slowing the spread of viruses through the general population. This is why masks have NEVER been recommended, let alone required, to stop previous worldwide pandemics. Scientists never recommended masks. Doctors never recommended masks. No one recommended them. Hell, in March Fauci, the CDC, and the WHO were very confident that masks didn't work, and advised against them. This is not surprising, since it was the accepted position by every expert in the world for years. But for some reason you think I should ignore all the previous science that showed masks not working, and accept that they do in fact work, when all the real world results from every nation on earth clearly show that the pre 2020 scientific understanding on masks was actaully correct. </p>
<p>Yes, there is some usefulness in certain settings for wearing masks, but those settings are few and far between. And this notion that masks are better than nothing is pure bullshit. Places that did nothing and places that had hard core mask mandates have ended up with the same results. Masking was not better than nothing. It was the same as nothing.</p>
