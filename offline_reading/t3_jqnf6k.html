    <strong>Genuine Question...</strong>
    <p><p>Why are you guys against masks? Like, I just wanna know what your perspective is. It's just a piece of cloth that goes over your face, and if you can't breathe in it then you likely just have a mask that doesnt fit your face shape well. There's also a clear face guard you can wear instead if you really can't breathe. There's many options. So other than that, what are the reasons you won't wear a mask to protect others? If youre given the option to protect others from a deadly virus, why would you not take that opportunity? Do you not care about the safety of others? I just really wanna hear what thoughts you guys have that I may not have heard.</p></p>

        <p>I’m against forcing masks on people and the religious following of wearing masks. It’s pretty clear that masks are a Democrat cop out for gathering in large groups to “protest social change” don’t care if you protest, but stop acting like you can protest because it’s for a “good cause” but I can’t go watch a football game</p>

        <p>Nothing. I don’t care if someone wears a mask. And I understand why company’s force masks inside stores to avoid lawsuits. </p>
<p>But I’m from Barstow, and it’s hella hot out here man. Right now it’s starting to cool off, but in the summer it was really hot and it was hard to breath, but mostly it was completely miserable.  (And I’m a fit individual) I don’t really mind masks right now, although I still hate using it just because I have to breath in my own breath.(doesn’t smell bad just hot)</p>

        <p>well, when they breathe, they exhale droplets in the air that settles on objects around them. say they're in a store looking at a product. Someone else comes along and touches the product, but say that person has covid and now theres covid on that persons hand. Maybe they touch their face and now its on their face, next week theyre infected. also, sometimes you do have to walk within 6 feet of them. you ask me is it really that hard to avoid them, but is it really that hard to wear one in the first place?</p>
<p>plus, when you go to a fast food place or restaurant, you ARE within 6 feet of the person taking your order. and even if you stand 6 feet back, the louder you have to speak, the farther your breath droplets will go. </p>
<p>thank you for responding to me btw</p>

<p>Ok, well, I have OCD, and I've had actual therapy to manage chains of thoughts like that. 'I could do this, and someone could've done this, and this might happen, then this could happen, and people could die! Better do a precaution ritual, just in case'. People with OCD are told we have to learn to live with doubt. I can't believe people who allegedly don't have it -I'm sure it's now coming out more visibly in undiagnosed people too, though- are now being encouraged to think like this.</p>
<p>So, my OCD alone would be a reason it is a very bad idea for me to go along with this anti-contamination stuff, but I have nerve damage as well so masks can be painful. And I most likely had covid already anyway. Wasn't the end of the world, most people you could spread covid to are going to be just fine.</p>

        <p>but why are we content with just "most" people being fine and thats that? what if you had a grandparent who contracted it and got very ill and died because a family member had come in contact with said product? wouldn't you be devastated? wouldn't you feel like it's the fault of the person who didn't wear a mask and therefore contaminated the objects? </p>
<p>also, this is not about OCD thoughts, although I respect that. this is about logically thinking of ways the virus could spread and ways we can minimize the pandemic. I'm just trying to explain how someone not wearing a mask can lead to the spread even if people stay 6 feet away</p>

        <p>Use hand sanitizer then. It's not too hard to wear a mask for most people but some people have issues or special needs. Besides when they say mandate they mean you must wear it at all times. For fast food why cant you just pull it for 30 seconds when your taking the order and then take it off?</p>

        <p>I have no problem with people who have their mask on while ordering and then pull it down below their nose and then put it back up when they pick up their order. My problem is when people get angry with me for expecting them to have a mask on at my ordering window. I'm not allowed to open the serving window unless they have a mask on. </p>
<p>If someone has special needs and can't wear a mask, then they should have someone else go get the fast food or they should just not get it at all. I work at a dessert place and people act as if its as necessary as going in a walmart. There are also curbside services where you can have someone else shop for you for free at many grocery stores too</p>

        <p>my individual business decided to implement the mask rule. I believe that in this kind of situation, governments should be able to mandate masks in businesses. this is a very extreme situation and the only reason it's lasted so long is because people don't want to wear a mask. </p>
<p>in Japan, they only had a couple thousand deaths because their culture has normalized wearing a mask when youre sick. they have the virus under control and the US is the worst controlled because of the lack of masks and face coverings.</p>

        <p>what are these graphs supposed to prove? i feel like you just proved yourself wrong. in a state with high compliance, the deaths went down. in a state with low compliance, the deaths went up. if on a national scale, we want the deaths to go down, that means we would want to mimic New York's pattern. which was caused by wearing masks and being safe.</p>

        <p>i feel like thats reaching tbh. besides, those 2 states have very different environments. one is hugely urban and the other is not. are we supposed to have an increase like florida? the pandemic is under control in New York now, but not in Florida. </p>
<p>and with Sweden, Sweden at first trusted their citizens to make their own decisions about masks. but then when it was still out of control, they placed a mask mandate and it has worked.</p>

        <p>That's not Ok, you can't restrict the participation of the disabled in public life like that. I'm in the UK under lockdown and the weekly supermarket shop is the only thing I'm even still allowed and able to do. I live alone, we don't all even have someone who could do things for us, or not all the time.</p>
<p>It sounds like your workplace is unlawfully discriminating with that policy: maybe tell them that, point them to the medical exemption rules.</p>

        <p>The sheer ridiculousness of both having to wear them exercising but especially having to wear them exercising alone outside. If I hadn’t gotten yelled at multiple times doing exactly that I wouldn’t be so against it. I don’t have the time to explain, “Transmission is incredibly rare outside and it has to be exposure of more than 15 mins” when I’m a single female getting yelled at running outside. And to be clear, I love running outside much more than I like more humans.</p>

<p>While it's encouraged, it's understandable why someone wouldnt want to wear one while running. as long as you stay 6 feet away from anyone you pass, you should be okay. I rollerskate around my neighborhood all the time and I never wear a mask because that's not the situation it's needed in.</p>

        <p>No, I didn't hear about that. the WHO said to not wear one during exercise like that, so that's weird that it would be included in a mask mandate. If it's a heavily populated area with lots of joggers, maybe. I'd recommend just wearing a loose fitting one if possible.</p>

        <p>No, I am not 15. I'm in my 20s. How old are you? and I never said you were correct. I said that it's weird that the state mandated the masks during exercise because the WHO said not to. It's not impossible though.  wearing a loose mask is recommended in this case.</p>

        <p>I’m 39. My point is that you’re either willfully obtuse or not listening to what I’m telling you. Many states in the US have mask mandates that are contrary to both WHO and CDC guidelines, and you naively wonder why we’re against them? Do you hear yourself? They’re <em>not based in science whatsoever</em>. Just fear. And I’m supposed to go along with it just... because?</p>

        <p>i literally just found this subreddit today. I'm seriously just trying to have a discussion about it and see what people have to say. i see people like this every day and ive always wanted to talk to them just to see what theyre personal reasons are. if you dont like that im having a discussion, you can just keep scrolling.</p>
<p>also i'm not a kid. I'm an adult. but I guess anyone who disagrees with you only does so because theyre a stupid little child right?</p>
