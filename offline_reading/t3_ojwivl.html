    <strong>Please help vulnerable people (wear a mask)</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I come from the U.S. and recently the CDC (center for disease control in the U.S) has issued that masks are not required for vaccinated people, HOWEVER, unvaccinated people are recommended in public places. Obviously, getting vaccinated a personal choice, but I would urge those that are unvaccinated to wear a mask in public places. My mother is severely immunocompromised. COVID would kill her. Please wear a mask in grocery stores and other necessity stores.</p>
<p>TLDR: Whether or not you get vaccinated is up to you of course, but if you're not vaccinated please wear a mask.</p></p>
