    <strong>Employer pushing me to get vaccine—help?</strong>
    <p><p>My employer is implicitly pushing me to get the COVID vaccine. For background, I work in a medical office as a researcher. I don’t work with the patients, doctors, or other staff directly. I am pretty isolated though I am on site. </p>
<p>The HR rep has asked me multiple times if I wanted to get the vaccine. A few times in person and once over email. Recently, a receptionist and a physician have asked me why I am not getting it (idk how they found out I wasn’t). Both told me I would regret not doing so. </p>
<p>Idk what to do at this point. I know all of the staff have had the opportunity a few weekends ago to get the vaccine (I opted out) and now I feel like I am going to be socially ostracized and thus implicitly forced to get it. I am dreading working Monday. I feel weird about my decision and I don’t know why it’s such a big deal. I just wanna be left alone. If I were a medical assistant or a doctor I would get it. But I’m not. I’m not even in contact with other admin staff. Am I crazy? And does anyone here have some advice or words of wisdom?</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to add I’m part time (29 hours) and was only hired to work on a specific project for 3-6 months.</p></p>
