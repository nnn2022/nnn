    <strong>Where was the SARS-CoV-2 virus purified and isolated?</strong>
    <p><p>Calling all of the critical thinkers on this sub to show me evidence of the purification and isolation of the SC2 virus.</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm a PhD econ-finance who has always been interested in virology since being traumatised in 2003 by the SARS-CoV-1 debacle whilst holidaying in Singapore as an 11 year old.</li>
<li>I have read all of the literature on antibody dependent enhancement (ADE)/pathogenic priming/etc that occurred when SC1 adenovirus vector vaccines were developed.</li>
<li>I have also read the literature on ADE reactions stemming from RSV vaccines.</li>
<li>Masks don't work: they never worked in the 100 years that we had influenza and won't work now.</li>
<li>C19 wiped out influenza but for some reason, C19 can't be contained by the same procedures that were used to kill influenza.</li>
<li>I am aware of the blatant conflicts of interest that BMGF has in investing in all of the "vaccine" products that are being pushed on people.</li>
<li>I am from Africa and know that the idea that HCQ/CQ are dangerous is absurd: I consumed that drug for decades without any ill effect and it's got \~70 years of clinical use.</li>
<li>mRNA and cDNA therapies are not vaccines and they are based on the genetic sequence of a virus that doesn't exist outside of GitHub.</li>
<li>Fauci's NIH funded the WIV lab in China and also gave them the gain-of-function knowhow to work on horseshoe bats.</li>
<li>I am able to read in Eng, Fre, Ger and Spanish and would love someone to show me the evidence of SC2 being purified and isolated. Thus far, we only have the sequences that were given to the WHO by China. I haven't seen independent verification.</li>

        <p>I have posted papers before on Virus isolation and culture from infected patients. </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239045/</p>
<p>&rt;A patient was identified with confirmed COVID-19 in Washington State on January 22, 2020 with cycle threshold (Cts) of 18–20 (nasopharyngeal(NP)) and 21–22 (oropharyngeal (OP)) (1). The positive clinical specimens were aliquoted and refrozen inoculation into cell culture on January 22, 2020. We first observed cytopathic effect (CPE) 2 days post inoculation and harvested viral lysate on day 3 post inoculation (Figure 1B and ​and1C).1C). Fifty μl of P1 viral lysates were used for nucleic acid extraction to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using the CDC molecular diagnostic assay (1). The Cts of three different nucleic acid extractions ranged from 16.0–17.1 for N1, 15.9–17.1 for N2 and 16.2–17.3 for N3, confirming isolation of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>&rt;Also</p>
<p>&rt;No other pathogens were detected. Identity was additionally supported by thin section electron microscopy (Figure 1D). We observed a morphology and morphogenesis characteristic of coronaviruses.</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301718/</p>
<p>&rt;RT–PCR positive urine specimens (Ct 34) from day 12 p.i. was serially diluted in infection media and inoculated onto Vero E6 cells. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were clearly observed after 3 days (Figure 1B). Full-length viral genome sequence was acquired by next-generation sequencing (Accession number MT446312) with 5 nucleotide mutations as compared to the original Wuhan viral stain (Accession number NC045512.2) (Table S1). Cell culture supernatant was negatively stained and visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Spherical-shaped particles with distinct surface projections, resembling spikes, that were consistent with SARS-CoV-2 virions as published previously (Figure 1C) were observed [1]. Viral load in respiratory specimens and urine were quantitated by RT–PCR. Viral loads decreased over time in oropharyngeal swabs.</p>
<p>&rt;The patient had a high level of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM at early time points and declined over time while the IgG antibodies remained relatively stable (Figure 1E). In order to prove that the isolated virus was infectious to susceptible cells, fresh Vero E6 cells was inoculated with the virus and stained in an immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using serum obtained from the patient and from a healthy donor. Results showed positive fluorescence with patient’s serum but not with healthy control serum.</p>
<p>I think people have unrealistic expectations or ignorance about what is required to characterise a virus. </p>
<p>You don't need to be able have a 100% pure sample of virus in distilled water to investigate it, if you're running functional assays you want the virus close to it's native state, that's why viral supernatant is harvested in culture media and why the virus is propagated in cell lines. </p>
<p>In regards to the sequencing, the virus is being sequenced constantly from positive samples, 5 to 10% of all COVID-19 cases are regularly sequenced in the UK so that changes in the viral genome can be tracked.</p>

        <p>It's never been confirmed.  China was said to have isolated it, but they admitted that was a lie.</p>

        <p>PCR tests are useless because they have CTs that are&rt;35 which means that 97% of all positives are false. The tests also are not unique to "SC2" which is why fruit, vegetables and even animals have come with a "positive" result.</p>
<p>&rt;It's never been confirmed. China was said to have isolated it, but they admitted that was a lie.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Then someone else claimed to have isolated it, but then it was said to have been isolated for the first time several months later.</p>
<p>Back in Jan 2020, there was a great deal of chatter on ResearchGate about the existence of the isolated virus. I checked again a fortnight ago and the debate is still raging. I'd just assumed that it had been isolated until I realised that the sequence used to make the mRNA and Ad5 vaccines was from GitHub. Not that I ever needed to be convinced that the "vaccines" were dangerous, but now I know for sure that they will potentially kill billions of people. It's astonishing how corrupt science has become.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, the virus "pictures" are identical to influenza.</p>
<p>If the electron microscope 'evidence' doesn't include a unique isolated pathogen, it may as well be one of a bacterium. "But, but, look at the spiky ball that we see on TV! That's EvIdEnCe!"</p>

        <p>I sent you links in a previous comment.</p>
<p>Even if the virus had been isolated, the PCR test is useless for identifying unique genetic sequences as the current tests only detect a particular sequence that is NOT unique. That's why you have vegetables, fruit and animals testing +. This doesn't even include the fact that PCR tests with cycle thresholds &rt;35 result in a 97% false + rate. Each cycle doubles the amount of genetic material so 35 cycles = 2\^35-fold increase in original sample.</p>

        <p>It not being isolated would sure explain a lot of weirdness we've seen with all this. In the beginning, they refused testing for almost everyone. You had to get special permission from the CDC and I was hearing so many stories that even people that had symptoms and came from China were being denied testing. Not great for case tracking if you ask me. Then there's the fact that the vaccine is not the traditional method of making a vaccine. This could  explain why they had to use MRNA instead of the use of a "dead" virus.</p>

        <p>LOL, if there's no isolation then what genetic sequence is the mRNA 'vaccine' based on?</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's true. Maybe that's why they can say it's 95% effective. Might as well say it's 100% effective while they are at it. If I make up a disease and then make a vaccine for it, it's pretty much 100% effective.</p>
