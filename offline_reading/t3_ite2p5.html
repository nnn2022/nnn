    <strong>Masks and Personal Responsibilty</strong>
    <p><p>Since it’s mask protest day I thought I’d share my mask opinion:</p>
<p>There is very little evidence at this point that universal masking mandates, in the way that have been implemented during this pandemic, do much of anything to make an impact on slowing or preventing covid infections. I won’t waste your time with links since there are some great resources already posted on this sub regarding cloth and surgical mask efficacy. </p>
<p>What there is actual evidence of efficacy is the use of respirators - so think your N95 or greater mask, which feature a tight fit and seal around the mouth and nose and a thick filter. However, these are designed to protect the WEARER and were not made with filtering the exhaled breath as a goal. To really get that sort of both in and out filtration, one would have to wear something like a diving bell or an astronaut helmet and probably some sort of accessory suit to make sure all of your air in and out is only directed through the air system.   Anyhow, this really flies in the face of the “masking is to protect OTHERS” argument, which I feel was chosen specifically to create a sense of personal virtue attached to mask wearing and opens up all sorts of social psychological phenomenon that we have been witnessing with aggression, peer pressure, and groupthink among those who have really bought in to the universal masking message. </p>
<p>The reality is, effective masking is about protecting the self, which isn’t as sexy a message. But here’s the failure of this beyond the awful social issues that the mask propaganda has created: people who are actually at increased risks of poor outcomes with a covid infection are relying on ineffective cloth masks on themselves and others while they should be considering using a real mask and taking other precautions. </p>
<p>I feel that this is the underlying point when it comes to this pandemic: you have the most control over protecting yourself and relying on others to protect you is almost useless. Even the most effective thing one can do to help others, which is staying home when feeling sick, can’t always be achieved (what if you have to go to the hospital? What if that person felt ok in the morning and was coughing by the end of the work day?)</p>
<p>TLDR: Masks can protect yourself and not others, and ultimately you are responsible for your own protection when it comes to your health.</p></p>

        <p>I'm just gonna be honest. I don't care about other people. Sure, I care about my friends and family. I've already lost a parent due to a chronic illness. In the old normal, I spent hours each month volunteering in my community.</p>
<p>But in this new normal, I am done caring about the health of others. I am done because it has been demanded of me to care about every single thing--every arrest of a black person, everything Trump ever says, the environment, inequality, racism, every case of covid, every new restriction, that I'm just...done. Worn out. It's not my responsibility to save the world, so I'm bowing out and focusing on myself and my immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>When people ask, "Don't you <em>care</em> if you pass the disease onto someone else?" My honest answer is, No. I do not. I am not maliciously or intentionally doing anything to spread a disease. I'm just living my life as I have always done, among other viruses that have always been there, and have always been spread. Do these people, about whom I'm supposed to care so much about, ever think about ME? About my depression? About my PTSD which is continuously triggered by being isolated and forced to wear masks in public? Do they concern themselves with the fact that three months ago I formulated a plan to hang myself using a scarf in my utility closet? Are any one of these delicate flowers keeping themselves up at night, wondering if what they're doing is somehow contributing to my misery? And if not, why don't they start?</p>
<p>I'll say it again. I don't care. I don't care if I'm asymptomatic and a droplet of spit lands on someone. I don't care if I am symptomatic and somehow someone else is exposed. I don't care if I walk past an immunocompromised person in the grocery store, or an elderly person on the sidewalk. If we all cared about those things, we'd never be able to leave our houses again. So I'm done. My life is about me now, because I was forced into making it about me, since my needs have been disregarded and mocked for going on six months.</p>

        <p>Same.  I'm getting to the point where I just.  Don't.  Care.  </p>
<p>In the US, we've already given the gov't 6 months to pull their collective heads out of their collective asses and formulate a plan to protect those who are vulnerable to this disease.  I have already given them 6 months of my life that I am never getting back.  And quite frankly, that's all I'm willing to give.  People can shout the death tolls at me until they're blue in the face.  I just don't care anymore.  I've been bashed over the head with this so much I'm practically numb to it.</p>

        <p>Six months in and even after nearly 200,000 dead I still don’t know any of them even indirectly. Oh wait. My friend’s boss’s mother died from it. I’ve never met my friend’s boss or his mother soooo...what am I supposed to feel? I mean yeah condolences to him but I don’t know the guy. If my friend and these other “caring” people want to sit in their room crying daily over COVID deaths, they can knock themselves out.</p>

        <p>&rt; If my friend and these other “caring” people want to sit in their room crying daily over COVID deaths, they can knock themselves out.</p>
<p>Plus, none of these people even really give two shits about non-COVID deaths.  With the exception of those who've had an actual loved one die, they only care about deaths if the media tells them to.  My friend who's obsessed with the death counts in the US doesn't care when I tell him the same number of people die daily due to obesity-related heart disease, and that's not even seasonal.  Or, that 1300 people die a day in the US from smoking-related complications.  He just doesn't care.  It's only COVID.  Only COVID matters.  Thus, I have very little respect for these people and their "grief".  Their "sorrow" is just a conditioned response to the media.</p>

        <p>“My mask protects you and your mask protects me” is the ultimate gaslighting and it was designed that way for more buy in. Nobody wants to be considered a “careless, irresponsible person.” It was all setup to illicit an emotional response and conformity.</p>

        <p>At times this reminds me of the way colonial powers used divide &amp; conquer strategies or like a behavioral psychology experiment on what happens when you divide people into tribes of mask-wearers and non mask-wearers and then use a bunch of questionable information to set the mask-wearers against the not mask-wearers.</p>

        <p>I don’t have PTSD but you said my feelings better than I could. I would bet that most people only care about themselves and their social and family circles. It’s just not socially acceptable to say that right now so they’re saying they care about everyone and want to protect the whole world so they can save face and look good.</p>

        <p>I have adopted this policy as well. It's not my job to protect other people. I've given up so much this year, and people I'll never meet ask for more. No. That's it. No masks, no fucks given. I won't start coughing or sneezing on everything in sight but I won't be Howard Hughes either and start using hand sanitizer every 10 minutes. I just want my normal life back. You lost a family member? It sucks but they weren't going to live forever. Callous, I know, but you need to be honest with people.</p>

        <p>This was a somewhat harsh comment but it needed to be said.  I would give you an award if I thought it would actually do anything aside from give money to this smouldering husk of a website.</p>
<p>I think I finally figured it out today, the entire problem I have.  For the past six months we've been asked to change <em>everything</em>, practically drop our entire lives and focus on this one thing, even though the vast majority of people survive this virus, and my personal risk is practically negligible.  And I know that I should consider myself lucky, because I still have a job and can work from home, so even though I completely hate this situation (although I'm taking steps to improve things), imagine how much worse it is for people who lost their jobs or businesses?</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like a creeper, I do recognize your username and I think you've mentioned coming from a public health background.  I'm legitimately convinced that most of the "leadership" on this issue doesn't actually give a damn about public health or the general well-being of people.  If they did, we wouldn't be seeing the constant mixed messaging, fearmongering, shaming, etc from the WHO, epidemiologists, and others.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly what makes these people tick, but the fact that they've thrown away so many other concerns (mental health, discouraging routine medical care/screening during lockdowns, robbing children of proper education and socialization) shows that somewhere along the lines these people lost the plot.  I've considered many possibilities; perhaps they just feel the need to cover their asses, or maybe some of them actually do get some kind of thrill out of whipping people up into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Either way, something is seriously wrong, and I think they've managed to lose a lot of respect/trust, and sadly I can't say it isn't deserved.  We've given up so much for the past six months, and all these idiots in charge have managed to do is fuck up their own messaging, virtue signal on twitter about Trump, and probably cause half the people on this planet to develop anxiety disorders.</p>

        <p>Your stance reminds me of when I quit my job at a nonprofit advocacy organization and also dropped out of the local activist scene. I was putting so much effort towards saving the world that I was neglecting my own needs. All of the things that I was concerned about before as far as advocacy and activism went were back-burnered in order to focus on making myself happy and feeling more fulfilled. I had to stop caring about everything else so much in order to look out for number one. But if I don't take care of me, who will?</p>

        <p>Personal responsibility? Individual choice?  That sounds like a bunch of "old normal" nonsense.  </p>
<p>But seriously, nice post! And yeah, it continues to blow my mind that more people don't get how elegant and obvious the basic "personal responsibility" / "freedom" approach is. In a free society (which some of you kids may be too young to remember but this used to be), <em>individuals</em> should be the ones weighing the risks and benefits of participating in (or not participating in) various activities and taking (or not taking) various precautionary measures, and deciding for themselves what balance of "safety" and "living their lives" they're most comfortable with. The beauty of this approach is that it allows everyone to have as much (or as little!) "lockdown" as they want. You're terrified of this virus and want a super-duper deluxe lockdown? Cool. Stay home and lock yourself inside for six months / a year / indefinitely. Get your groceries delivered and Lysol-wipe everything down on your front porch while wearing a Hazmat suit. Let everyone else get on with the business of living their lives (and expediting the arrival of the herd immunity that will ultimately protect you if and when you do decide to rejoin society). And if being around people with a piece of cloth over their mouths is something that really gives you that much of a warm and fuzzy, you should certainly be free to patronize only establishments that <em>choose</em> to require (i.e., sans government coercion) that particular bit of security theater. Just as I should be free to patronize only establishments that <em>don't</em> have such a requirement.  </p>
<p>"But what if someone you live with is more vulnerable or risk-averse than you are?" Gee, that's tricky. What would you do if you wanted to get a cat but your roomate had a cat allergy? I suppose you'd work that shit out, or get a new roommate.  We don't just ban cats. Of course, the people you live with <em>should</em> be part of your decision-making. But there are an endless number of possible solutions for people's unique circumstances and preferences. We can't allow the most vulnerable and/or fearful to dictate that we all live our lives in a state of constant paranoia and isolation.  Again, your health is first and foremost <em>your</em> responsibility.</p>
<p>"BuT wHaT aBoUt ThE GroCeRy StoRe?" The now-classic doomer argument here is that when you get infected with the 'rona while getting your "frivolous" haircut (or engaging in any other activity that the person making the argument considers "non-essential"), you thereby put others at increased risk when you encounter them at the grocery store during one of their "essential" shopping trips.</p>
<p>It's like, bitch, get your groceries delivered if you're that scared. Or, per this post, shop for groceries wearing a properly-fitted N95 mask, or a full Hazmat suit. <em>Or</em>, as per my argument above, you should also be free to shop at a store that voluntarily adopts a mask requirement.  </p>
<p>Plus, their thinking is so one-dimensional. Yes, if you get infected, in the short-term, you might put those you encounter (via the mutual choice of both parties) at <em>some</em> increased risk for infection. But over the medium- and long-term, you're moving us through the curve and building herd immunity, ultimately making it <em>less</em> risky for others to go out.</p>

<p>also, i like how you go with getting rid of the roommates instead of getting rid of the cat. cats have inherent value - they will keep you warm, they will kill things for you, they poop in a box, and sometimes they return your unconditional love!</p>

        <p>People have also been conditioned to think that having a centralised governing body is just the norm. People can’t fathom that society could function without a centralised government. It’s just something that’s unthinkable. Centuries of conditioning has pretty much rendered this kind of critical thinking obsolete. Let’s not forget that they’ve tarnished the image of what anarchism actually is. You don’t think of no top-down centralised governing body but rather angry mobs rioting. Nonsense.</p>

        <p>Now that N95s and KN95s are widely available for purchase, the entire universal mask argument has no legs. Anyone who wants to, can purchase one of those masks to protect themselves. Same ones that frontline healthcare workers are wearing. If you are wearing one, it no longer matters what your neighbor is doing. You are quite welcome to wear a face shield and goggles too- just like healthcare workers. Those at risk need to protect themselves and shoulder the inconvenience- just like anything else.

<p>"people who are actually at increased risks of poor outcomes with a covid infection are relying on ineffective cloth masks on themselves and others while they should be considering using a real mask and taking other precautions."</p>
<p>This makes me so incredibly sad and upset.  The bad information that has been spread about masks has real consequences.  People view them with all the sophistication of someone carrying garlic or a cross to ward off a vampire and it may actually be putting some at-risk people in danger.</p>

        <p>I think the false assumption underlying all of this is there is some collective responsibility to reduce COVID deaths and spread of the virus. Responsibility only makes sense in reference to the individual person. If more people choose to go out and interact with each other then presumably more people will catch it. If more people wear masks that work less people will catch COVID. But the point at which it's worth trading quality of life to reduce the likelihood of catching COVID is simply a matter of personal preference. If more people choose to go out and do things and more people catch COVID then that is simply their preferences revealing themselves, not an avoidable tragedy. </p>
<p>Also, someone can't expect others to stay home to keep them safe from COVID. If they are not willing to stay home themselves and accept a lower quality of life then how can they expect someone else to carry that burden for them. I think driving is a good analogy. More people using the roads increases the likelihood of accidents occurring. But how is it right that you go around demanding other people stop driving to make you safe? They have just as much a right to use the roads as you do. If you don't like the risk that comes with driving then stay home.</p>

        <p>I was attacked and robbed on Monday night at my car. The guy was in a surgical mask, and is suspected to have killed someone 10 mins after. I won’t be able to identify him in a line up bec his face was covered w the mask. So, now I will probably have PTSD of seeing others in masks at night</p>

        <p>&rt;Having letters next to your name doesn’t <strong><em>magically</em></strong> grant you special insight into things that others cannot comprehend</p>
<p>It doesn't grant it magically -- it does, however, grant it practically. Letters next to your name indicates years of study and practical experience in fields that laypeople have little to no familiarity with.</p>
<p>That's why we have medical school (leading to an MD after one's name) for physicians, and Board Certification for surgeons. That's why societies have their earthquake-resistant skyscrapers designed by civil engineers (MSc after one's name).</p>
<p>That's why <strong><em>you</em></strong>, pickleoodles, have the dubious privilege of typing your CoViD-skeptic posts on a laptop or a smartphone -- which was developed, and is continually being updated and improved by innumerable physicists, chemists (the LCD screen), software engineers, computer engineers, applied mathematicians, etc. -- all of whom have a great many letters next to their names.</p>
<p>You put me in mind of that Isaac Asimov quote (which is, unsurprisingly, getting a lot of use lately):</p>
<p>&rt;There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that '<em>my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge</em>.'</p>

        <p>The first literally does not. There are literally uncountable cases of lay people making major discoveries in every major and minor scientific field. </p>
<p>The second is also potentially a no. Your mother has practical experience with cats. A behavioral scientist may not realize that their lab tests don't give a full picture. Being able to put theory into practice is often severely lacking in modern academia.</p>

        <p>There are plenty of experts that disagree with masks and lock downs. Being against mask mandates is not a fringe opinion. There is a reason why there are advanced, industrialized, nations that have decided not to lock down or mandate masks.</p>
