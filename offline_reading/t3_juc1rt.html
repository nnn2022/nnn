    <strong>I want to kill myself if lockdown continues too far</strong>
    <p><p>If lockdown continues up to next year and classes are all virtual yet again, I plan to just kill myself. Even having next semester be virtual is way too much, but if this lasts another year, I just know I cannot take that. I can't live in a world like this. I don't give a shit if in 5 years everything 'gets better' and returns to normal, these are the prime years of my life stolen away from me, so much psychological and physical damage, I'll never recover if it lasts much longer. This is NOT living. I am absolutely shocked that people are actually accepting and getting used to 'social distancing' and fear mongering as if living in fear of others and living in your own bubble is ok. I cannot live in a society like this. I am just so shocked that the world has come to this.</p></p>

<p>Stay in the Game. Enjoy this free book. I wrote it 15 months ago. Enter THEGIFT at checkout. I wrote it for times like this. I thought we had 10 more years... Nope. 5 months after the launch of my book, the world went full TEOTWAWKI. https://themostbeautifulworld.com/store/dancing</p>
<p>Keep on dancing brother.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat like you. However, I suggest you talking to a therapist.  Mine has helped me a bunch. Let's hope this works revolts and changes. Hang in there, stay off social media and the news. I have found places where you don't have to wear a mask and those are my sanctuaries. Get out there and live.</p>

        <p>Hold on bro just relax for a sec, it's not worth dying for such a stupid lockdown, i understand what you're talking about this world literally went to crap, and sheeple just eat it up like it's some kind of candy, they only care about themselves their ignorance will get us all controlled by these sick governments,
It's all their fault all of this is happening right now, if they only questioned it and did the research we wouldn't be going through all of this dystopian authoritarian system.</p>
<p>But we can't give up right now i suggest you leave school yes i understand you would love to achieve what you want but I'm afraid that you will have to take the covid vaccines to continue this, i feel like 2021 is going to be worse but who am i to say these things, God is still in control he will help us Don't be weak have faith that God will get rid of all of this dystopian world we're living in i hope you achieve what you love in a normal way without any control ‚ù§</p>
