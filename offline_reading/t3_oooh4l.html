    <strong>Tired and Hopeless</strong>
    <p><p>I am so sick, so tired of all this. So tired of the lockdowns, the hate, those putrid masks. I'm so tired. People who don't even know me, wish me dead. They hate me for some perceived injustice against them;  by me not agreeing to a medical procedure I don't need, as I've already had covid, this gives them carte blanche to be revolting. </p>
<p>Foaming at the mouth, they call for horrific measures to be taken against us. Does no one remember anything of the last century? The Armenian Genocide, the Holocaust, Rwanda, the famine in Ukraine and on and on. Blood shed for no reason, soaking into the earth, crying out for justice.</p>
<p>I've never hurt anybody. I don't understand how people can be so evil, so awful. I'm a quiet introvert who reads, feeds the ducks, and takes pleasure in the simple things in life. A hot cup of coffee, a moving piece of art, the smell of a rose.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do. If feels like the whole world is closing in on us. Vaxx passports, mandated vaccines, etc. WTF is going on? I am so consumed with worry, I can barely function.</p>
<p>Update: Thank you for all your kindness and the lovely award. Much appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Do. Not. Back. Down. 
This is only going to get worse. 
If it’s not obvious by now this has nothing to do with the virus and everything to do with the “Build back better”.</p>
<p>But WHO is it better for?</p>

        <p>Stay strong friend! This is exactly how TPTB want you to feel, they want you to be exhausted and resigned to this way of life so you give in and let it happen. DO NOT. Keep being you, making your own decisions having your own opinions. Many are under a spell, the propaganda has worked on them. It didn't work on you. Being awake is painful. Know you are not alone even if you feel like it.</p>

        <p>I feel you, I am fucking mad not just tired, furious and angry when I see those stupid masks, and people dumping them on the ground everywhere. I am furious with constant juggling with rules between countries, and their idiotic rules it ruined my and other people's plans. Now I am going to loose job because of this shit vaccine, most of people I know turned into mindless drones I am angry to see them anymore, my father included.</p>

        <p>It's hard for an introvert, but try to open up to more people in real life where you can. Some people will be arseholes about it but in my experience, most people I speak to are actually as skeptical as I am or more.</p>
<p>Never forget the internet is riddled with bots. Even if all of this was completely above board and as the official story dictates, you would still have bad actors in foreign countries that would want to take advantage of it by getting us all at each others throats. Spending a few quid on thousands of bots to spread bollocks is a cheap and effective way to do this.</p>
<p>Stand your ground, be assertive but polite. Just say no and don't give in to the illusion that we are outnumbered. We outnumber the tyrants by many many magnitudes.</p>

        <p>I actually said this exact thing to my wife about half an hour ago, but in the context of not posting about it on LifeLog.</p>
<p>I think we still have the time to open up to people in the real world, in fact this might be our last chance before lockdown 3.0 comes this winter.</p>

        <p>I just started journaling which can be helpful. Also I’m planning on separating myself from what’s going on, which includes reading news on Reddit. Try to focus on the little things that make life worth living (family, loving those around you, enjoying the outdoors, etc). You are not alone- this all has been very difficult, stressful and infuriating.</p>
