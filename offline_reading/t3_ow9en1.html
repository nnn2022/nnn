    <strong>"Men have forgotten God"</strong>
    <p><p>"if I were called upon to identify briefly the principal trait of the entire 20th century, here too, I would be unable to find anything more precise and pithy than to repeat once again: “Men have forgotten God.” The failings of human consciousness, deprived of its divine dimension, have been a determining factor in all the major crimes of this century. The first of these was World War I, and much of our present predicament can be traced back to it. It was a war (the memory of which seems to be fading) when Europe, bursting with health and abundance, fell into a rage of self-mutilation which could not but sap its strength for a century or more, and perhaps forever. The only possible explanation for this war is a mental eclipse among the leaders of Europe due to their lost awareness of a Supreme Power above them" - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.</p>
<p>I'm aware that many in this thread, and indeed many in the world are atheists and would reject God, even if they claim to believe in a higher power who's merely unconcerned with our daily lives, they either believe in him fully, or not at all. However, that's besides the point.</p>
<p>I believe wholeheartedly that, while this speech was made many decades before our current situation, all our current problems and struggles of today are caused by just that, "men have forgotten God". They've lost their intuition of a power higher than themselves. Our so-called leaders have sold their souls out to the highest bidder, they have lustfully sought after power, riches and control, all while claiming to be acting in our best interests. Sanctimoniously they claim that if even one person can be saved, we should sacrifice our freedom (given by God), our autonomy (given by God), and our will (given by God) all for the sake of even just one life. Yet, they ignore the many atrocities that plague our world every day. Blatant attempts of genocide and slavery are brushed off as mere "cultural differences". Oh, how quickly have we forgotten the old adage, that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. </p>
<p>Oh, how hard we try at being the poster boy of "doing the right thing" that we're willing to surrender our fellow man to the authorities at the mere possibility they've acted against the orthodoxy of the day. We've become an athiestic, self-destructive and utterly vain generation of man that's more concerned with the appearance of morality than the principles of virtue. Everyday we seek more and different ways to become victims of society, so that we may tout our oppressions as if they were badges of honor. </p>
<p>"Silence = Violence" they say, "Love not Hate" they say, as their hearts are bursting with malevolence and disdain for those who they perceive to be worthy of tenfold the measure of hell than themselves, God forbid. </p>
<p>For in forgetting God, we all have sinned, and all come short of his glory. In forgetting God we have undoubtedly put ourselves in his place, and in doing so se cannot fulfill the Law, but rather we drink damnation upon ourselves. In seeking after "Our Truth" we have rejected "The Truth". We must crucify the flesh with it's lusts, and live after the spirit, not desiring vain glory, provoking one another or envying one another.</p>
<p>I implore you, stop living for yourself, stop living for safety and comfort, there is a higher purpose, forsake you vanity, and seek the God whom you have forgotten, while he may still be found.</p></p>

        <p>The problem isn't that we rejected God, it's that we've rejected Godly morals. You don't need to be religious to see the inherently good messages derived from Judeo-Christianity.</p>

        <p>That popularization of belief in"God," and subsequently, indoctrination into it's various dogmatic religions, has been a major cause of the mentalities that have emerged war throughout the western world.</p>

        <p>The premise you assume: existence of "God," is and cannot be fact. Assumption of an existence of "God," a god, or any relative notion — is confined to ever only prove, at most, no more than mere belief; an opinion. Suggesting a belief to be fact or true is troublingly narrow-minded and incredibly arrogant. Stepping further out with that mindset to support instillment of public policies is absolutely mad. Besides, true spirituality does not hinge upon acknowledgement of any religious dogma, not that there's any universal basis for something so vague as "spirituality," anyway. Beliefs are only opinions, and opinions of supernatural and existential entities will always mutate throughout the course of every civilization.</p>

        <p>Your reply comment is what you believe.. And just like your belief; ironically, also an opinion. Is equally arrogant and narrow-minded and the only troubling thing is you wrote what you wrote without realizing the irony of what you were saying... Further validating OP's point.</p>

        <p>I won't venture too much into religion debate. I'm tired of it and no one, neither me or my interlocutors, will change idea. 
Anyway, my humble opinion is this:</p>
<p>First of all, religion has a good side, like almost everything in this world. In past it has been used also for controlling masses, but it doesn't mean it must be trashed completely for that. The core message is positive: introspection, seeking God and the good and so on.
The problem, I'm not American but that's the impression I had of the situation there, is that it is applied to the letter, lots of extremist/scammer preachers that are unknown in Italy, home of Vatican, for example. They do a big damage to religion. This led to a counter reaction, especially in Hollywood: have you ever noticed that it's since about 2000 that virtually all sci-fi movies have got the"it's not magic, it's science" message? And, that if there's a religious character, he'll either die or he's the idiot/bad guy?</p>
<p>Now we're going to the God-less part:
everyone is familiar with the golden idol in the Bible. The message was, among others, to not worship material things (gold), to not worship a single part (calf) but celebrate the whole (God).
Today, as it is evident for some, and almost everyone in this section I think, the golden idol has become science: </p>
<p>Thrust science and its priests! Inject the Blessed Serum! </p>
<p>I'm daring too much you say? But think about it: people today blindly inject a substance without considering the potential risks, and only because Science told it, without any data about mid and long term effects. An act of faith, if you will.</p>
<p>Now, God punished the worshippers of the golden calf.. what if this worshipping of science is the modern version? Can you imagine the immense damage that a delayed effect in the vaccine could do in the world (example: subtle myocarditis and/or micro blood clots that grow over time)?</p>
<p>Ps: don't see this in black and white, I'm not saying to trash science. I'm saying that it's a valuable human discipline but it can't replace a religion, nor any other human disciplines. It's just a part of the whole human experience.</p>

        <p>I agree with the sentiment. This is very much near the root of all the world's evils.</p>
<p>To live in accordance and communion with the divine, makes such actions impossible.</p>
<p>We have as a people, for such a loooong time, been systematically and fundamentally conditioned to be so disconnected from an essential part of our birthright and nature.</p>
<p>As we begin our remembering, such a relationship IS clearly a real, felt, personal relationship and communion, between the person and the divine.</p>
<p>Seeking out "god", cultivating the connection, is part of restoring the world as she should be. But the "Bible" or holy book, is within each of us, which we must refind or uncover.</p>

        <p>It's not that men have forgotten god, it's that god is irrelevant in orienting yourself within modern society.  God wasn't forgotten, he was killed by rationality and science.  </p>
<p>Which leaves the question.  How do we maintain some form of morality without god.  It all boils down to social relations, products of evolution, etc.  Morality has lost it's perceived objectivity, and thus it's following.  That was the beauty of a belief in the divine, you could get people to obediently follow something like little sheep.  The issue was determining WHAT that is.  Some religions got it better than others, but none get it right.</p>

        <p>I think you can have morals without an attached belief system.  However, I think religion brought people together on a regular basis and it strengthened communities.   We don’t have a sense of community.</p>
