    <strong>Milgram's obedience experiments help explain our predicament--and how to get out of it</strong>
    <p><p>Human beings will hurt each other, kill each other, and even torture each other if someone tells us to do so. There are countless examples of this in history. In the 1970s, Stanley Milgram, a professor at Yale, proved it experimentally. </p>
<p>Milgram told participants that they were part of a study to discover the role of discipline in learning. Their job was to be the "teacher"---the learner, they believed, was a participant like themselves, but he was actually part of the study. The learner was supposed to memorize a series of random word pairs, read aloud by someone pretending to be the experimenter. Every time the student made an error, the "teacher" was instructed to give the student a shock of electricity.</p>
<p>There was an elaborate "instrument panel" with 30 levers. The first was labeled 15 volts, the second 30, all the way up to 450 volts. The last lever read "Danger: Severe Shock!" and was marked XXX. Before the experiment began, participants were given a sample shock of 45 volts. All of them said that it hurt quite a bit. Keep in mind, this was 1/10 of the highest possible shock. </p>
<p>The experimenter  instructed the "teacher" to increase the level of shocks each time the student could not remember a word pair. Of course, the student made mistakes on purpose to see how far the "teacher" would actually go. When they got to 300 volts, the learner would pound on the wall, but then fall silent.</p>
<p>As the electricity increased, the participants sought guidance from the experimenter, who told them to continue discharging the shocks--even after the the learner stopped responding. He would say things like, "Whether the learner likes it or not, you must go on until he has learned all the word pairs correctly. So please go on.‚Äù</p>
<p>Of the 40 people who participated, not a single one stopped before the 300 volt shock (the point at which the "learner" pounded on the wall and stopped responding). Only five disobeyed the experimenter at that point. A few more disobeyed at 315, 330, 345, 360, 375, and 390 volts. But 26 participants, or 65%, continued all the way until 450 volts. </p>
<p>Milgram repeated this several times, with a variety of twists. </p>
<p><strong>In one modification, he added a second teacher (who was in on the experiment). This second teacher's role was to disobey the experimenter when the shocks increased in voltage. And when he disobeyed, many participants were able to find their backbone. Only 10% continued all the way until 450 volts (versus 65% in the experiment without a disobedient teacher).</strong> </p>
<p><strong>This is the lesson for us.</strong> </p>
<p>DISOBEY. And let other people see you disobey.</p></p>

        <p>So the authority figure in this experiment was only supposed to say a few sentences and nothing else. "The experiment must go on." I can't remember the others. Just sort of generic statements to continue. So like you mentioned in your post 65% of people pulled the fatal lever. If you watch the video of the experiment it's pretty disturbing; the learner screams in pain and begs to stop the experiment. Most of the participants are visibly bothered by it and can tell want to stop. </p>

<p>This one and the Prison Experiment are good to study.</p>

        <p>I didn't realize the videos had been released. Ugh. </p>
<p>Yep the Prison experiment also very relevant. It helps explain why the doomers want to kill us for disobeying. Our disobedience doesn't inspire them, it enrages them. </p>
<p>The people on the fence, or apathetic, or who know this is wrong but just don't have the guts to say so, need to see us disobey though.</p>

        <p>Ah, the Milgram experiment, some of it's been debunked though, can't remember which parts exactly, but the general message still stands.</p>

        <p>Definitely been debunked.  One such example: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317914282_Deception_and_Illusion_in_Milgram%27s_accounts_of_the_Obedience_Experiments</p>

        <p>I just read what you linked. It has nothing to do with debunking Milgram's findings. It just says that he lied about the debriefing process by not actually telling participants it was fake. Participants were traumatized and some of them kept checking the obituaries to see if they had killed their "learners."</p>
<p>Edit: digging deeper, elsewhere Perry says that only 50% actually believed it was real, not 75% like Milgram claimed. And of these, two-thirds didn't go all the way with the shocks.</p>

        <p>The wikipedia article really misrepresents Gina Perry's work, as far as I can tell. Here is an actual summary of her book. She is writing about the harm done to the participants--not trying to debunk the actual experiments. <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/behind-shock-machine">https://thenewpress.com/books/behind-shock-machine</a></p>

        <p>All the badasses, mavericks, and rebels are in prison, broke, outlaws, or died in wars. Civilization is setup like this on purpose. Usually these types are detrimental to society... until we need them to challenge the status quo and buck the establishment. </p>
<p>Now we are so civilized and over-socialized that we are dependent on the very establishment that seeks to enslave us. The only way is to become savage like our ancestors.</p>
