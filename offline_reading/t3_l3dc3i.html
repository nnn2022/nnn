    <p><p>Maybe I'm wrong, hell I probably am, but nothing about the last year has seemed normal or like the people in charge are trying to genuinely help us in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<p>I feel like they're daring the plebs to try to stand up for themselves. That's what having 25,000 fucking ARMED soldiers roaming the streets of Washington is all about.</p></p>

        <p>That’s exactly what I think they are doing too. Pushing us with absolute nonsense to either make us kick off a civil war or justify bringing in the UN or whoever to restore “peace”. It’s makes the most sense with the absolute garbage nonsensical mandates.</p>

        <p>I feel like Trump threw a wrench in their whole operation. I don't think even he thought he had a chance. He gets there and just starts undoing years of back door deals with foreign governments. I think this past year was just to get rid of Trump</p>

        <p>100%. Why do you think domestic terrorism is the new topic of the day? I condemn the idiots who went into the Capitol and killed that cop but after watching 100 000 other idiots burn, loot, and kill all summer....im not surprised it happened</p>

        <p>People that support cops normally are so pissed the Capitol stuff happened. I saw a few people charge and throw punches at cops. Because of covid, because of how mistreated we are by the government right now people finally exploded. </p>
<p>I both disagree and agree with the Capitol stuff. It was probably to much to soon but it was also a fun reminder to the government that they work for us. I'm sad the one lady passed but I have zero sympathy for the politicians in all that.  Most of them pushed and pushed and pushed us. What did they expect to happen?</p>
<p>The troops in the capital are a bad omen to me. The longer they stay there the more I will be worried that the inauguration was not what they were preparing for. If they are as crazy as they appear to be there is some disgusting stuff they already have written up and are just itching to release.</p>

        <p>The end game is to incite civil war. It's easier to take away constitutional rights if every one is fighting over a perceived enemy. It'll be harder to take away guns one by one.</p>
