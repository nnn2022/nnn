        <p>What I'm doing. I'm avoiding much of the social media and news. When I go out to a store and I must wear a mask it's either going to be offensive or silly. I try to not engage with negative people or maskholes.</p>

        <p>Yes I’ve been doing that too, but just lately it isn’t doing the trick anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve had it with seeing signs to wear masks, and seeing people wearing masks. It feels like a Twilight zone episode when I leave my house. And I can’t just stay home so much anymore. I want to socialize and see people’s smiles. I want to be able to travel again, and go to concerts and other gatherings and events. </p>
<p>I’m sorry about the complaints, just wondering how everyone else is beating the discouragement.</p>

        <p>I went around to stores maskless until I figured out the ones that wouldn’t say anything and now I only go to those. That’s helped tremendously to combat the feeling of alienation.</p>
<p>I’d also recommend brushing up on the things you want to bring to the table when you finally are able to go to gatherings and events. Whether it’s playing an instrument, learning a skill or trade, sharpening your wit, getting fit, learning another language, etc.</p>

        <p>You'll see a 90% improvement by not consuming social or mainstream media. Just look out the window and realise its not that bad.</p>
<p>Second, if that helps then try find something that makes things feel normal. Get up on time, have a shower, get a coffee, get lunch from that place you used to go to when you were working at an office or going to school, or at least a close approximation. Something to make things feel a bit more normal. </p>
<p>Once you feel a bit more motivated try making some goals, try get back into the swing of things. Keep your focus on things you control and in a year be able to say, at least I accomplished this while I waited for the world to get its sanity back.</p>
<p>I feel you though man, I want the exact same thing but every fiber of my being screams at the idea of giving in, taking the black pill. They don't deserve to win that easy.</p>

        <p>Find a hobby.  Something to work on.  Learn to paint.  Read some books.  Decide to get ripped and exercise a lot.  Learn to cook well.</p>
<p>Turn off your TV and radio.  Listen to podcasts that are from February or earlier.  If you want something to watch, get on a streaming service and opt out of ads.  Get off of main stream media and take breaks from the news.  Turn your phone off during set times of the day.</p>

        <p>Short hikes in beautiful places, especially near bodies of water. At least a few minutes a day in the sunshine without sunscreen or sunglasses. And be gentle with yourself about being sad. It’s okay and a very natural reaction to the insanity. Hang in there, man.</p>

        <p>Try to avoid the news and even the internet if you need to. Taking breaks will help. </p>
<p>Keeping a healthy sleep schedule. That and keeping up with hygeine and chores. They are all small and might seem insignificant, but they allow people to have control over their lives and to feel more motivated and in a better mood. Going outside and exercising are two more. You could write down your frustrations and then rip up or burn the pages. I've done it before and it helped. You can start learning a new language and/or a new skill like knitting. Another suggestion is to find some comedy stuff. It's a great way to relieve stress.</p>

        <p>I've been doing work around the house  (stuff I've been putting off), weekend trips outdoors and watching old shows and movies. I also started working out again and finally bought a tire pump for my bike, so I'm trying to get back into good habits. I was letting myself go in the beginning of the pandemic under the "it's only 2 weeks, so fuck it" premise, but those 2 weeks were turning into months and I was getting caught up in the discouragement. I've been out and active for about 1-1.5 months and it's really helped. And eating better.</p>

        <p>I can relate. Though in my case, I let myself go for kinda the opposite reason: they're testing and tracing people, they're gonna try to quarantine me and my loved ones, the world is going to shit faster than I expected and I don't know what to do. Hell, I'm still not sure what to do. But I know what NOT to do: give up. Nope, don't give up. That's what they want us to do. Don't give up, even if just to spite them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, turn it all off. Seriously. Not dabbling and picking it up after a few minutes. Take a dopamine holiday, find other enjoyments within the parameters of your current oppression. Don't let them take away your "you." </p>
<p>If you need to set times to look at news and media, do it. Otherwise ask yourself what you really need to know today. The horror will still be here, and you will always still be behind on information overload.</p>
<p>Seriously, it took me a few months of trying, but severely limiting myself is a real weight off, and I can still do civil disobedience irl, where it counts.</p>
<p>You got this, there's too much joy in life no matter what. My doctor P. Sychedelics can also offer a prescription for a more grounded perception, closer to natural than this artificial mess.</p>

        <p>I just ordered a sheer tulle mask from Etsy. I'm excited to be able to maliciously comply and I dare anyone to say anything to me, at which point I will say I have health issues which are none of their concern.</p>
<p>I deactivated Facebook and only check Instagram a few times a day from my work PC.</p>
<p>I only hang out with a small number of likeminded folks. My typical social circle is much wider and varied, but I'm done indulging people's fears. If they want to hide for months and expect me to coddle them through it, too bad. I have one formerly good friend who has turned down invitations to hang out until it's "safe." At that point, I doubt we'll still be friends.</p>

        <p>I sleep about that long right now, lol. I would tell you my secret if I knew it. I have joked I would like to be in comatose as I've been in the past and be kept unconscious longterm. </p>
<p>I've deleted Facebook (torture myself by checking it now and then), that's after trying to mute everyone who was just hysterical or sharing about this constantly. It didn't work as more people would turn. </p>
<p>I stopped watching the news long ago. Stopped listening to whatever our government and premier or health officials were saying.</p>
<p>Apart from that I can think of nothing else. I'm lucky that masks barely exist here unlike for you... yet. I can only think of the coma idea. 🤣</p>
