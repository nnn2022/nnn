    <strong>Trust the Canadian Government</strong>
    <p><p>The government has wrongfully imprisoned over 24 000 Japenese Canadian citizens during WWII, many who were 2nd and 3rd generation and have never been to Japan.</p>
<p>The government who brought over immigrants from China to build the CPR, paid them a low wage and gave them the most dangerous jobs then tried to send them back once the work was done.</p>
<p>The government who endorsed Residential Schools.</p>
<p>The government who carried out sterilization to people they deemed mentally unfit.</p>
<p>The government who did horrific experiments to patients at the Allan Memorial Institute.</p>
<p>The government who cannot provide clean water to all of their citizens.</p>
<p>The government who just paid out a known terrorist $10 million for not protecting him since he is a Canadian citizen.</p>
<p>The government who apologized for WE scandal, and continued on without consequence.</p>
<p>This is the government that I should trust with my health, and throughout history they have proven that they know best and have people's best interests in their hearts.</p></p>

        <p>You know it. I get the feeling Canada has this overall great reputation simply for being Canada, but in reality Canada is shit, and has a shitty history.</p>

Canada is no exception, but people blindly trusting the government is a huge problem.</p>

        <p>The problem is we are a small group of free thinkers and the masses (who are large) only believe MSM in Canada (CBC Communist Broadcasting Corporation). The masses are to tired to read and do research on the internet. The CBC does it nicely for them and socialism.</p>

        <p>Canada is as crooked as it comes.</p>
<p>I grew up in ohio, which was just hinted at being number one at public corruption because of the first energy scandal. Which still hasnt been repealed yet, lol.</p>
<p>Only in Canada, can a Employer, WCB, and Doctors lie about things like the effects of refrigerant poisoning. (They all told me freon cannot cause irregular hearbeat, and that I do not have it.) I have a holter that clearly states my prevailing rhythm was sinus arrhythmia, and the doctor, wcb, and the college keep telling me over and over that is normal sinus function and that there was nothing wrong with me.</p>
<p>My doctor can lie and claim things like I didnt like the effects of a calcium blocker that I was never given so he didnt put me on beta blockers for a condition that he said I did not have and put me on blood pressure medication instead.</p>
<p>The college of physicians of nova scotia say this is fine, because I didnt tell him it was Freon poisoning.</p>
<p>Canada is literally blowing my mind. They do these things because they know they have a very good chance of getting away with it. Canadians believe that medical prejudice is normal, they dont see anything wrong. lol.</p>

        <p>agree with most of these points but let's look at the facts about Omar Khadr for a second. I really don't trust anything coming out of the West when it comes to anything muslim/terrorism related but let's entertain the idea that everything about it is true.</p>
<p>Dad takes him to Afghanistan when he's a young boy. His dad has ties with al qaeda. The kid ends up fighting against US troops in Afghanistan and kills one with a grenade at 15 years old. He gets detained and put in guantanomo bay for 10 years.</p>
<p>Let me give an analogy here using Japan because it seems from your post you don't have any ill-will toward Japan. So anyways, </p>
<ul>
<li>you're a kid in Canada. </li>
<li>Your dad takes you with him to live in Japan. US decides to go to war with Japan. You identify more with Japan and you know how evil the USA is (this one is easy even in 2002, as under a decade prior the US was responsible for over 500k children dying in Iraq because of sanctions they placed).  </li>
<li>You decide at 15 years old to fight for Japan against the USA invaders (who let's face it are and have always been the real terrorists, you can ask anyone from any south american or middle eastern country)</li>
<li>You kill a soldier with a grenade, get put in Guantanamo bay for 10 years and labelled a terrorist for fighting the ARMY of an invading country.</li>
<li>Years later, some dude on reddit makes an incredibly ironic post by referring to you being given reparations for being a terrorist as an example about how government shouldn't be trusted. </li>
</ul>
<p>Just think about it objectively and ask yourself if you're really expressing this opinion on your own or if it was taught to you? Because as far as I can tell that sounds like a talking point out of every neocon's playbook.</p>

        <p>after posting this and thinking about it, i'm incredibly surprised that the kid was given money at all. I don't even think they did it because it was what they thought was right, because they don't give a fuck about that. They probably gave him the money just to fuel the flames between lib/conservatives, and that's the truly ironic part as I sit here and argue about it.</p>

        <p>After the war was over a lot Japanese Canadians lost the right to their property.</p>
<p>With Omar Khadr, I will admit that there is ignorance on my behalf and I am not aware of the full story.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the follow-up comment. When I read you OP, the Omar Khadr situation seemed (IMO) to be very out-of-step with the rest.</p>
