        <p>The war taking place right now is between the wealthy men and women, who have taken it upon themselves to make all the world's decisions, and the everyday citizens, who just want to be left alone, so they can enjoy the short time we have on this earth. </p>
<p>Problem is, only one side knows it is fighting a war. Our elected officials, the kings and queens, members of parliament, those that support them and those who do their bidding are attempting to take control of every aspect of our lives. They want to increase their wealth, gain more power and decide what we can and cannot do, who lives and who doesn't, with impunity. </p>
<p>Our governments and our public servants were supposed to have one job and one job only, carry out the will of those who elected them. They were supposed to be, by the people and for the people. This is no more. We are ruled through force and coercion. We have allowed this to happen. If we continue to complain from behind our laptop screens while doing absolutely nothing to fight the war that has been waged, many of us, our children and our children's children have nothing but sadness and despair in our futures. </p>
<p>Some might call me an alarmist. Some might say I sound hopeless. So be it. Most people are demoralized and tired. I don't know if enough of us have the energy or fortitude to fight this fight. So, I am anxious. At times I am somewhat fearful. I want my kids to have a happy life. I want them to be free. And, I'm not sure either will happen.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely correct and I feel the same way at times. We need to be alarmed. </p>
<p>The only reason we’re fighting from behind laptops and not in the streets is because none of us are hungry. Yet.</p>

        <p>To build on what the large response said I'd say to stop voting. If anybody thought TLDR.</p>
