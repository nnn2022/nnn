    <strong>I'm an ICU nurse, and the hospitals are reaching a breaking point</strong>
    <p><p>You don't want mandated quarantine restrictions. Fine whatever </p>
<p>You don't want to wear masks because you think they don't do anything. Fine whatever.</p>
<p>What I'm sick of seeing is people that think they know what's going on in the hospitals when they have no fucking clue. People are dying, and it's not just covid. People are dying of ordinarily recoverable issues, because of covid. There are no ICU beds left. Zero. None. This is the life we live now, and it's terrifying.</p>
<p>Our general ICU has 4 units with 12 beds each. 3 of those units have been fitted to take covid patients. And every single one of those three units is completely filled with covid patients sitting there for 20+ days. That leaves 12 icu beds for the rest of the patients. THERE ARE NO BEDS FOR THEM, AND THEY ARE DYING</p>
<p>People didn't stop having strokes...</p>
<p>People didn't stop having car accidents... </p>
<p>People didn't stop getting shot...</p>
<p>People are dying from things they would have survived before this. Because they are forced to be one of 15+ being held in the emergency room waiting for an ICU bed. I don't know about you, but if I had a head bleed I sure as fuck wouldn't want to be waiting around in an ER hallway for over a day getting juggled by an nurse with 3 other patients.</p>
<p>And half the time when I come in we're shortstaffed, so people will have to extra patients. It's not safe for the patients, and it's not safe for us. We are reaching are breaking point. The hospital system was not meant for this much capacity.</p>
<p>The is the new normal that's forced on those of us that work in Healthcare. And people willfully refuse to see it. But go ahead and ignore what me and everyone in healthcare is saying. You've done a great job of it this year.</p>
<p>Tldr: People are dying because there's no beds, no staff. And no one cares.</p></p>

        <p>Oh?</p>
<p>I'm a patient with medical issues going on. I had to go to Urgent Care yesterday, where the staff made me jump through hoops to be able to get seen, aka the "Covid rundown" of hundreds of questions, temperature checks, and all that crap. Then the doctor I saw there, barely touched me, as if I had cooties and didn't even prescribe anything for me, telling me "just wait and see". They just rushed me out the door because I didn't have Covid or Covid symptoms. Meanwhile, 90% of the others there were being seen for Covid, and they got more thorough exams and treatments than I did. This has been the case for every medical facility I've gone to lately as well.</p>
<p>I've been a "good patient", wearing my mask even during a two hour MRI I had to have. Yet the doctors and nurses have treated me like absolute shit. I have a biopsy scheduled soon, and I have to live in fear that they will cancel it because it's an "elective surgery" even though my doctors have said "you need to have this done asap", then when I'm like "What if it gets cancelled due to government mandates", they stare at me blankly and shrug their shoulders with a "Well, that would suck for you" attitude.</p>

        <p>This is what I'm talking about. Elective surgeries are postponed in most the hospitals in my city. I don't want people like you going without care. Government mandates aren't canceling elective surgeries. No one from the state or federal government demanding these measures. We aren't doing elective surgeries because there literally aren't enough beds or Doctor's for them.</p>

        <p>My mother worked in ICU for most of her career. She says it's normal to be at near capacity. She also says she's sick of hearing nurses moaning about their job. If they didn't want to do that kind of work they shouldn't have signed up for it. Her words, not mine.</p>

        <p>We aren't "near capacity" we're well past that. At any given moment there's minimum 15-20 people waiting for ICU beds down in the ER. THAT IS NOT NORMAL.</p>

        <p>Okay, but with more than 200,000 people that have supposedly died of COVID, almost everybody should know at least one. Personally, I know of no one who has died, nor do I know somebody who knows somebody who has died. </p>

        <p>Well I'm talking about critical patient care. What you're talking about probably has more to do with the fact that at the end of the year it's next to impossible to get an appointment at an outpatient office, because everyone schedules their Doctor appointments for the end of the year. Mostly because people are trying to make the most of their insurance coverage before it rerolls in the new year. Don't really think covid has much to do with it.</p>

        <p>I'm in the US. Typically most people in our covid units are around 60. But like 1/4 of them are in their 40s and 50s. We honestly don't have many old (80+) people hanging around our ICU because because people like that are fragile. Either the virus, their preexisting conditions, or a combination kills them fast. What will often happen with those really old people is they won't even go to the ICU because their families see how poorly they are doing and they'll make them DNR (do not resuscitate) and put them on comfort measures.</p>

        <p>I haven’t had covid. Haven’t ever tested positive for antibodies or covid itself. I do everything outside that I can. I am single and live very far from family. I still play but the rules but I get called a murderer for leaving the house to exercise (which I am overweight. Shouldn’t me exercising and trying to get right physically be a net positive for y’all so that I stay out of your ICU?). I get called a murderer for seeing friends outside even though I’m tested regularly and have never had it. So how am I at fault for trying to not kill myself by seeing friends outside the home? We meet outside, we exercise outside. Why must I be relentlessly screamed at for trying to do anything to keep me from killing myself? I’m sorry but more than just covid patients matter and I basically get told daily that I’m shit for being alive because that means I’m a disease vector. What happened to “first do no harm”? Doesn’t seem like that’s even in the picture. It feels like as much harm as possible is being done to absolutely break people mentally who actually have zero control over what happens with a respiratory virus. I’ve never even carried the damn thing and I’m still a murderer apparently. But I guess life will now always be this way so I’ll find a way out of this life sooner than later because I can’t fucking live like this. Congratulations on still being employed, btw.</p>

        <p>That's like saying you don't you don't care about people living in poverty in Europe because there's more people living in poverty in Africa. Also my post isn't even talking about covid deaths?</p>

        <p>Occupancy data disagrees with you. Also, considering past media reports about flu seasons, nurses are prone to sensationalism.</p>
