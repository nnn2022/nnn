    <strong>Who owns the media holds the power to decide what is going to be known as "truth" in the future.</strong>
    <p><p>The thing that piss me off more is that at the end of the day the people in power are the ones who are going to decide what is gonna be written on history books. So even if we know that they're telling us a lot of bullshit and doing really bad shit  to our kids at school they're gonna teach whatever is more convinient for them. And that's gonna be what everyone knows as "truth".</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely.  Easiest way to control events and people is to control the flow of information. But people are taking note with all the recent censorship. I'm hearing more and more distrust and more critical thinking from people.  </p>
<p>We will learn to look at MSM the same way we look at commercials. Ignore the propaganda and go directly in search for what they're censoring.</p>

        <p>On this sub we are aware of all this crap, and probably we're gonna try to spread the information, but as it's happening now they're gonna label us as freaks or CoNsPiRaCY ThEoRiSt! All I can see around me right now is people using double masks while they drive alone in their own car, I'm starting to lose faith in humanity! Even when you try to bring actual data, scientific facts/papers this morons just repeat what the news tell them, after a year it's starting to become frustrating. At this point when I'm having a conversation with someone who wants the vaccine at all costs I just tell him "go for it". If you want to be a Guinea pig it's your choice. Let's see what happen when the long term side effects kick in. I'm starting too see it as an idiots' harvesting at this point. Sorry if I'm cynical, but at this point I just care about the closest ones to me. I'm sick of arguing with Covidiots!</p>

<p>Also, the Internet now allows for independent information. It's not as bad as it seems.</p>
