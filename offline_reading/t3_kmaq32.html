    <strong>Once a symbol of great character, the mask will soon be used to identify diseased dissidents.....</strong>
    <p><p>Here's what's going to happen in the very near future. Masks will go from being the symbol of unselfish, heroic compliance to the symbol of the diseased, unhealthy outcast.</p>
<p>Once our esteemed medical professionals feel that enough jack offs have shown up, to get the battery acid shot into their bloodstreams, and once enough cities, states and countries have the mandatory "health passports" in place, the big switch will commence. </p>
<p>A press conference will be held and we will be told that all vaccinated peoples no longer have to wear the masks. And, anyone who isn't vaccinated will have to continue wearing the masks. If you are not wearing a mask, you can be stopped by law enforcement, at anytime, who will ask to see your "health passport" to make sure you are allowed to be out in public without a mask. </p>
<p>Just like that, the mask and anyone wearing it will be shamed and called a dirty, unhealthy leper. All the people who have called you a murderer for not wearing a mask today, will be the same people calling you a disgusting, diseased dissident tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p>Let's hope civil unrest happens before this does.  I think more people than we think will deny this vaccine. It'll create modern day groups of unvaccinated people who fight against the tyranny. They will be labeled as terrorists. They can only control us if we allow it. This reality feels false more and more everyday, but I still have hope!</p>

        <p>Yeah the only person I know who has outwardly said they will get the vaccine is my mother. That’s sad on a whole other level, but the point is most people won’t oblige.</p>

        <p>In Nazi Germany "Heil-Hitler" was introduced as an everyday greeting. If you failed to repeat the greeting "heilhitler" you could be suspected of being a dissenter and reported to the Gestappo. </p>
<p>The small and passing phrase was an immediate compliance check for everyday germans. In the same way, wearing a mask is a public and immediate social signal that; </p>
<ol>
<li>Affirms your belief in the "deadly" virus and efficacy of restrictive measures. </li>
<li>Demonstrates your compliance with government mandates.</li>
