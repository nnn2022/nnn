    <strong>The Vaccine - Facts</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I've been following this sub since pretty much the beginning and it's safe to say that this whole 'plandemic' was a joke from the start.</p>
<p>However, in regards to the vaccines, I'm losing my bottle a bit. I'm not sure whether the relentless people surrounding me are getting to me, the endless propoganda, or its my own will braking, but I'm very much in 2 minds about whether to get the vaccine or not.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that in the near future we won't even be able to leave the house without proof of vaccination.</p>
<p>In regards to the vaccine itself, what I am asking for is evidence of what the dangers ACTUALLY are. Or, vice versa, why it isn't as dangerous as some are making out.</p>
<p>I keep seeing tonnes of theories such as depopulation agendas, DNA splicing, microchipping, and the rest of them however because of this I am torn as to what to believe.</p>
<p>As of now I am totally on the fence, because I personally don't believe either side of the coin. I feel like there is so much disinformation coming from everyone, and that everyone is just hard pushing their own 'belief' that I can't take anything anyone says as fact. For example, someone told me yesterday that if I go and get the vaccine (I'm in the UK by the way) I'll get a free takeaway... Why do I need to be bribed? But then again, I'm not seeing anything convincing to make me not take the vaccine. I get that some people have had adverse side effects, but then everyone I know has had both jabs and had nothing wrong with them. I guess I'm just a bit confused in that respect. </p>
<p>That's why I am asking here for everyone to put forward their ideas, with evidence (or at least the reason they believe their theory) so that myself, and anyone else in my position, can truely make their own mind up.</p>
<p>Thanks you for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance to anything you can contribute. I look forward to being able to finally make up my own mind.</p></p>

        <p>For me it‚Äôs not a matter of politics at all my opinion is solely based on data. Which is vaccinated people are currently in the majority right now for people in the hospital due to Covid. Realistically if you had already gotten covid last year you have antibodies already if you aren‚Äôt fat or old or have a pre existing condition your chance of recovery even if you get covid us very high. </p>
<p>mRNA vaccines in general I don‚Äôt know if they are bad or not but what I do know is that they alter your DNA. So for a vaccine that was rushed to make, that hasn‚Äôt been approved by the FDA and that is technically an experimental vaccine with unknown longer term effects seems risky to get then just trust your body‚Äôs immune system which is a very smart, adaptable powerful part of humans. </p>
<p>Aside from this I believe in people having a choice what is going on right now not just in the United States but a number of countries is oppressive which makes me not interested in getting it even more. </p>
<p>Like I have said the choice is yours but you couldn‚Äôt pay me to get. I would rather live 20 more years of a happy fun life then live to be 100 years old and oppressed. Stay strong brother!</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if "altering your DNA" is the right language to be using. I think we could all stand to have a better understanding of how mRNA vaccines work once they enter your body. For OP, please look up Professor Sucharit Bhakdi and check out his interview on YouTube ("Blood Clots and Beyond").</p>
<p>If what he fears ends up being true, then we really need to be cautious about any mentions of booster shots. I personally hope that he is 100% wrong because like you, all of my friends/family have the shot. I don't want to imagine what life will be like in a few years if what he says is true.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your comment, this seems like the most logically way to look at it. I guess we won't have the facts until a few years down the line, like you say the long term effects are unknown.</p>

        <p>I'm just like you. I want to travel as I'm retiring soon but the vaccine passport shit is getting to me too. </p>
<p>My problem is that I have taken 1 dose of the Pfizer vaccine and I ended up in the hospital with a mild case of Atrial Fibrillation. My Cardiologist is concerned with me getting a second dose.</p>
<p>What are the people like me that have been warned NOT to take the vaccine going to do when the Gestapo ask for my papers?</p>

        <p>So sorry to hear this, that's an awful situation. Seems very hypocritical of the government to force you to have the vaccine, then have one of their health professionals be concerned about you having a second dose.</p>
<p>I hope for your sake this situation resolves itself soon, I couldn't imagine retiring, finally getting your life back, only to be secluded in your house because of this.</p>

        <p>Last I saw, around 1 in 140 people will be seriously harmed by the vaccines, from UK data.</p>
<p>Those are totally unacceptable odds for a disease with a fatality rate that is in the same ballpark. However they are still low odds, so sure, you could know a few dozen friends and all of them fine.</p>
<p>It's no biggie, unless YOU are one of those rendered permanently blind or paralyzed from a stroke, or developing a lifelong autoimmune disease such as multiple-sclerosis. Then it's a big fucking biggie, huh? </p>
<p>And if you ARE hurt the medical establishment will want nothing to do with you, will deny your injuries had anything to with the vaccine, will deny you even exist.  </p>
<p>If you die, your death will be marked as "covid 19", to encourage others to get the shot, so at least your stinky bloated corpse won't have died in vain, so that's nice?</p>
<p>So, odds of being seriously fucked up? Low. Odds of dying? Very low. Bit like covid itself then.</p>
<p>If no jab, you might be hurt by covid.</p>
<p>If jabbed you might be hurt by covid, and you might be hurt by the jab. You also face a higher chance of being hurt by covid for a few weeks after the jab, and a chance of developing ADE/VAR as the jab wears off, plus you're submitting to a system that wants you on the boost-plan for life and a 'vaccine' passport controlling your every move, forever.</p>
<p>You do you?</p>

        <p>The stats you provide are shocking really, shocking that the government's of the world are willing to gamble with those odds.</p>
<p>You make a very valid point, I have no idea what the vaccine will do to me. However, if I do not have the vaccine, it is looking like the lack of a 'vaccine passport' will more than control my life, it will ruin it.</p>
<p>I do not want the vaccine, but I'm coming to the conclusion that ultimately I may not have a choice.</p>

        <p>I found myself being squeezed and opted for the best option of a traditional vaccine, and still got hurt by it.</p>
<p>My biggest lesson, in hindsight if I could advise my previous self, would be 'Don't panic and decide just yet'.</p>
<p>You MAY not have a choice, sure. But you MIGHT. And as long as you might, my advice is don't gamble with your health. They might force you? OK, wait until they do. </p>
<p>You can't undo the injection.</p>
<p>Things are coming to a head; it's obvious the vaccines are failing, becoming more and more obvious they're hurting people, and the success of alternatives such as ivermectin are getting harder to hide.</p>
<p>Hold out for another 6 months and the landscape could be very different.</p>

        <p>If you‚Äôve had Covid you shouldn‚Äôt need a vaccine. This is one (among many!) issues about the vaccine that concerns me. If it was a genuine vaccine doctors would check your antibodies and give you a dose relevant to your body. The fact they tell those who have had Covid to take the jabs rings alarm bells for me. </p>
<p>You might find you can regain freedoms with verification you‚Äôve had it. I‚Äôm in Greece with medical apartheid occurring and those who have had, and recovered, are lumped in with the vaccinated for privileges. </p>
<p>Generally, in answer to your question, you can always have the vaccine, but once you‚Äôve had it it‚Äôs in you for ever. So take your time. Perhaps when the trial ends in 2023! ü§ó. </p>
<p>The most worrying thing is the lack of data. If I were you I‚Äôd watch out for this winter‚Äôs flu season. If the vaccinated fall like flies (as some predict) you‚Äôll be glad you didn‚Äôt have it.</p>

        <p>Here's my position:</p>
<p>What we know (is a fact), is that people under 50 without other health issues have statistically zero chance of dying from Covid. </p>
<p>Why should I get a vaccine for absolutely no medical reason? </p>
<p>There are documented instances of adverse reactions to the vaccines and we don't know if there are long term side effects. </p>
<p>This entire thing is just an instance of mass hysteria in my opinion, but the extent to which the government is going to control individual actions is concerning.</p>

        <p>This is, and has always been, my point. We do not need the vaccine. What concerns me is what the vaccine will do to me, my family, etc... All for the sake of being able to go on a night out.</p>
<p>There are only 3 people in my life that are with me on this now, even my wife has been vaccinated. I guess this is why I'm ready to throw the towel in, because ultimately if they all pass away, or get seriously ill, I might as well go with them.</p>

        <p>Ouch, my wife keeps bringing up getting vaccinated because it would make things easier at her job. Given the menstrual issues that can occur and the fact she has a pre-existing condition in that regard I am truly concerned of a bad outcome for her if she gets vaccinated. Plus she already had Covid! Oh, and all sorts of people I know who got vaccinated are still getting Covid! </p>
<p>At this point it really does come down to popular resistance, if any of us give in it makes it that much harder for the rest of us.</p>

        <p>This is true, without standing together nothing will change. I just hope in the very near future there will be something drastic, something that comes to light that changes everyone's perspective of this vaccine and the vaccine passports because so far, its all one sided. You can't move without someone, or something, reminding you to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Any idea when the vaccine will get FDA approval? My thought is if you want to get the vax that is fine, if you dont that is fine as well. My concern is that I will be forced for work reasons to get it.</p>
