        <p>This is the kind of post that makes us look like dumbasses. It's a respiratory virus. It attaches to receptors in the nose and throat.</p>
<p>The reason masks aren't foolproof is because people aren't wearing surgical masks designed to be foolproof: they're wearing 'face coverings' from cloths to scarves, which from the perspective of a tiny virus is just a grid of holes.</p>

        <p>i dont think masks are useless but as virus transmissions in hospitals have shown they are only a small part in transmission. Lock downs are the same, They are easy to introduce macro (lockdowns) and micro (masks) procedures that sadly do little to limit transmission. They are highly visible deterrents but not effective. It doesn't mean they do literally NOTHING. Personally i think throwing out years of credible research into virus is not sensible. They are a real thing.</p>

<li>May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</li>
<li>A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</li>
<li>A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medince found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</li>
<li>A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data</li>
<li>An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</li>
<li>An April 2020 Cochrane review (preprint) found that face masks didn‚Äôt reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</li>
<li>An April 2020 review by the Norwich School of Medicine (preprint) found that ‚Äúthe evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks‚Äù, but supports the use of masks by ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.‚Äù https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1</li>
<li>A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</li>
<li>An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591</li>

        <p>I dont care if people tend to use cloth masks??? Ur argument is invalid ? U Said masks dont work, I just proved it does. You want proof? Look at interwiews with nurses telling their story, but no you wont believe them because they are paid actors right?</p>
<p>You link me " science " about masks eventho it's based on cloth masks ( lol Nice try ) but you refuse to listen to other science telling you that it's a virus thay can kill and using cobber masks helps. </p>
<p>Humanity fases a global pandemic every 100 years or so, this is a fact proven by history. This is our times pandemic of our era, whats so fucking hard to understand about that? </p>
<p>Do you realize how many people have Said the same shit, but later had someone in their family die from it? Do you Even realize that getting covid can kill you Even after you loose it? Because ur body is so thorn that it can form blood cloths? Just stop being so damn naive, you are not smart enough to make a decision about something you clearly have no fucking idea about</p>

<p>Mask mandates haven‚Äôt worked to slow down the spread, your rebuttal to the thing I sent was ‚Äújust trust the science‚Äù but science isn‚Äôt a one way street it‚Äôs a method of research </p>
<p>And your arguments are based on emotion not facts, such as ‚Äúpeople who have downplayed the virus have had a family member died‚Äù </p>
<p>And how is this a pandemic??? A real pandemic doesn‚Äôt have a 99.7% survival rate, dodgey test kits and questionable death certificates</p>

        <p>Before when we didnt have the medecine we have today you could die from a normal flu, same with alot of others common diseases we have today. And hoe can u say mask dont work ? It has slowed corona down alot in my country? </p>
<p>I dont even understand ur point what are u trying to say ? What do you want from it? U dont wanna wear a  mask thats it? 99.7 survial rate for a completely healthy being, how about all the others who has other sicknesses? Old people? Fat people ? Astma ? </p>
<p>I get it, u would rather believe in lizard people controlling us rather than just thinking ok, it's a new virus that can kill alot of people, maybe I'll just do what I can to avoid infecting people that can die from it. </p>
<p>Thousands of people are dying, people who could be alive right now if not because of this virus, so because millions will live, and 100s of thousands will die, you say fuck them, let them die I want to eat my burgers and party.  </p>
