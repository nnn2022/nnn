    <strong>Traveling and I want to refuse a test (USA)</strong>
    <p><p>I have seen videos of Chris Sky refusing a C test for entry into Canada so it should be far easier in the USA hopefully.</p>
<p>Has anybody been able to successfully refuse the required test needed before exit from the USA- is it an airline policy or government policy?</p>
<p>I would also like to refuse one for entry back into the USA.</p>
<p>I am traveling from USA to Puerto Rico fyi so it's not even international. I travelled to Mexico back in October last year and there were no tests required back then but it looks like there are now?</p>
<p>Do I have a medical/religious exemption to stand on if I wish? Who is requiring said test now when they were not required before?</p>
<p>FWIW I see no reason to take the test and I do not personally trust it and have strong religious beliefs against it as well and would like my body autonomy to be respected. I have been going to the gym in FL since June 2020 5 days a week, sharing machines, seen my 60+ year old parents 3x last year and never had issues.</p>
<p>I understand corporate airline policy is to wear a mask... I can comply with that for the duration of the flight.</p>
<p>I do not wish to take the test for entry/exit into my homeland as a citizen.</p>

<p>Demonstrate <strong>a negative PCR molecular COVID-19 test result</strong> (which consists of a nasal or throat swab), <strong>taken no more than 72 hours prior</strong>. Testing sites on the mainland U.S. can be found <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html">here</a>. It is highly recommended to get tested prior to arriving on the Island given limited resources. A rapid test will not be accepted, as it can sometimes yield false results.</p>
<p>"<strong>Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and excluded from the CDC requirement to provide a negative COVID-19 test result to return to the mainland United States. Quarantine mandates, recommendations, and entry requirements may vary by state."</strong></p>
<p>It looks like it is not required for EXIT from the USA but rather for entry into PR?  </p>
<p>If an <strong>asymptomatic traveler</strong> (a person who doesn't present any symptoms) arrives on the Island with a <a href="https://app.travelsafe.pr.gov/"><strong>complete Travel Declaration Form</strong></a><strong>,</strong> but <strong>without a negative PCR molecular COVID-19 test result and is not awaiting results</strong>, a <strong>Testing Authorization Voucher</strong> <strong>will be provided</strong> for the traveler to get tested locally. A list of testing sites on-island will be provided at the airport and can also be found <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2ec47819f57c40598a4eaf45bf9e0d16">here</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>While awaiting results, the traveler will need to quarantine for 14 days / the duration of their stay, whichever is shorter, or until test results are provided digitally to the Puerto Rico Health Deparment at their lodging property, cover COVID-19 testing fee, and possible extended stay. A rapid test will not be accepted, as it can sometimes yield false results. </li>
</ul>
<p>Who will be enforcing said quarantine Lol? No thanks. How are they going to track if I isolate myself or not? This is absurd.</p></p>

        <p>While PCR tests are only required when entering the US from an international flight, some states/territories have implemented their own criteria, such as Hawaii and Alaska.  Not sure at which end of the flight they are checking for tests but I am guessing it is a pre-boarding requirement.  Regarding quarantine - some places have been more harsh than others.  I remember seeing stories from last summer of tourists in Hawaii being arrested.</p>
<p>My first bit of advice would be don't give your money to places that clearly don't want it - go to Florida instead.</p>
<p>Barring that, don't post shit on social media.</p>

        <p>Coming from Mexico you definitely need a test unless you can get a note from a health professional declaring you’ve already had COVID and recovered (within 90 days of travel).   Source; I’m in Cancun right now and have already had my test needed for re-entry.</p>

        <p>I traveled from Cancun back to Miami in October 2020 and never had to take any test for entry nor exit. When did this change? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Did you try denying the test? Would the airline deny you boarding if you did not have it?</p>

        <p>I was also in Cancun in October and didn’t require a test.  This is a fairly new rule (I think since January).</p>
<p>https://mx.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/covid-19-information/</p>
<p>I did not try denying the test.  It was provided by my resort and is certainly required to fly.  However, you can drive across the border without needing a test.</p>

        <p>I flew to Alaska last July and they had just started requiring test results on arrival. When deboarding you were immediately funneled into a line where they required a negative pcr from within 72 hours. Or you had to test there on the spot and promise to quarantine until test results (I think they had a two week self quarantine option as well). You were also supposed to retest a week later if you were still there. There really wasn't any meaningful enforcement once you got out of the airport though.</p>

        <p>Hi, a few notes for you as I’ve been in PR for a few months:</p>
<p>-you will not get turned down airline boarding or entry to PR if you have no test
- you will select an option that basically says “I have no test and will quarantine for 14 days” option on your entry form. This option is there for people like you so that you can still enter the island without endangering the locals if you have some sort of personal issue with testing
- you’re right, there is obviously no one playing big brother tracking whether you actually are quarantining 
- keep in mind that the PR healthcare system is poor relative to mainland US, a result of so many doctors leaving for the states over the last 20 years and too little healthcare funding. 90% of PR is classified as underserved from healthcare perspective. This makes a potential run on hospitals more dangerous than FL in the event of a bad outbreak. This is likely one reason why PR went on lockdown early on, has measures in place for tourists entering the island, and still has more covid measures in place than most places in the states. 
- not sure what you’re planning on doing here but the attitude of “I deserve to be able to go to PR and not respect their entry guidelines” will definitely not play well with the locals</p>

        <p>Just don’t go to PR. For your sake, it has happened before. Some other “I want to refuse to take my test and this is a list of my selfish reasons why” did that after the locals got tired of YOU people coming in swarms to PR. You are not welcomed either, especially after the massive amount of ridiculous tourists that have been coming to the island.</p>

        <p>“Religious Beliefs” I’m sure your god wants you to be respectful of your fellow human and have empathy for those currently suffering from it directly or indirectly. Stop trying to use it as an excuse to be a shitty human. Because when “judgment day” comes gods gonna have pictures of all you psychos trying to use religion as an excuse. Just simply say “ I don’t give a fuck” it’s a lot easier and maybe you’ll be spared in the end for being honest 😅</p>

        <p>No matter how much you don’t want to be part of it, you are. I really don’t get how you conspiracy theorist believe that Covid doesn’t exist when I witnessed first hand what it does by working in a hospital. My coworkers didn’t make it so I won’t respect your “belief” when it’s harming others.</p>

        <p>I do believe it exists. I just don't believe the response is warranted for the 0.09% chance of death for only those with comorbidities and destruction of an economy and the problems that come with that which are far worse than covid would ever do- suicide, financial ruin, mental illness has caused greater damage than covid ever would. </p>
<p>I am sorry about your coworker and your loss. I am not claiming to know the truth of everything, just saying to always be open minded and question everything... if that is "conspiracy thinking" to you then you realize that's exactly how the scientific method works.</p>
<p>If you think the response govt has done is backed by science you are mistaken- it's fake science and propaganda running the show and the politicians making the bs rules aren't even following it themselves, many have been caught red handed. I know several doctors personally who have been silenced and pressured against speaking out. I have a science degree from a top US uni myself by the way. </p>
<p>Let's face it... the govt lied to us and is still doing so, ruined the social development of kids, pharma companies are about to cash in big, face zero liability for the adverse events with the jab, and keep us in a perpetual fear of living. It's absurd and needs to stop.</p>

        <p>I have a hard science degree (<a href="https://B.Sc">B.Sc</a> Biology) from UF (a top 5 US public university). I am self employed, produce almost 7 figures a year, and not some basement dwelling gamer like most people on this site. Pretty well qualified to have a legit opinion on this based on my analysis of the data. I'd bet I'm perhaps more qualified than you or equally as much since you work in a hospital.</p>
<p>I don't give a crap what brainwashed "professionals" say who are all being paid and bought by pharma companies. Most academic professionals are dumber than you'd think, devoid of any critical thinking at all, and just virtue signaling hacks. What you're not hearing about unfortunately is the thousands of scientists and doctors who have called this scam out for what it really is.</p>
<p>What you're saying right now is the scientific method is about following blindly what authority says and not questioning anything at all... you're creating a religion out of science and while I have nothing against religion, no that's in fact the exact opposite of how the scientific method works.</p>
<p>Here's a start to research a bit from real doctors speaking out and getting silenced for it - <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">https://gbdeclaration.org/</a></p>
<p>Anyway don't have time or care to convince you, what is about to happen in the coming months is a complete destruction of the financial system and that's what this is really about - the Fed is buying all assets, destroying the middle class and this is all a distraction to create a technocratic feudal society. Best of luck to you and your family, it would be wise to prepare</p>
