    <strong>Quick thoughts on censorship stuff.</strong>
    <p><p>Probably already obvious but anyone who supports censorship of any kind will find ways to justify it. 
It doesn't matter what the counter argument is. I'm not going going to change anyone's mind. </p>
<p>It's sad though because no matter how much I disagree or don't like what someone says I can't imagine wanting to silence them as if they don't exist. I want to hear what they want to say to get an idea of otheir perspective. If I didn't want to hear other people's thoughts then no one is forcing me to listen. </p>
<p>It sets a scary precedent because if certain types of censorship become acceptable then where do we draw the line? It's a slippery slope and I would hate to see my 1st amendments rights be stripped away. If I ever have kids I don't want them to grow up in a society like that. </p>
<p>It all just makes me sad :(</p></p>

        <p>It's absurd.</p>
<p>People are celebrating the fact that Donald Trump is being silenced. Do they think they won't face the same issues in the future?</p>
<p>I don't have to be a Trump supporter to defend freedom of speech.</p>
