        <p>There are a lot of holes in what they claim:</p>
<p>1- It is true that the tests have false positives. But it is also true that they have false negatives as well. There is no perfect way to analyse this. We have to use the tools we have (and they all have advantages and disadvantages).</p>
<p>2- Overall IFR is nowhere near 1%. Although 0.13% might be on the low end of the spectrum, it's not far off. Most studies put it in the 0.2% to 0.5% range. However, this is not a useful number (imo). This is taking the whole world into account. There are many factors at play in different countries. Aside from discrepancies on how COVID deaths are counted (with COVID, by COVID, tested positive within past 30 days, tested positive period, not test but death with COVID symptoms, etc.) there are other factors such as healthcare systems (some poorer countries may not be well equipped to deal with rising cases) or comorbidities (for example 36.2% of American adults are obese vs 2.1% of Vietnamese or 4.3% of Japanese). I think it is better to look at the data that relates to your own region rather than the average of the entire global population.</p>
<p>3- CFR is even worse than IFR. Is he saying there are no asymptomatic carriers then? If so, why  do we have to wear masks? And if you are using CFR, you can't really compare it to the Flu (for example) because most confirmed cases are not even accounted for. Most people who get the Flu, think it's just a cold and go about their life without seeking any medical help. IFR or CFR on their own don't mean anything unless you can compare them to other infectious diseases. We live with other diseases around us all the time. What we have to see, is if our reaction or taken measures, are justified and proportionate to the situation.</p>
<p>4- I know he didn't mention this, but you should be careful when just looking at IFR. Even if COVID had the same IFR as the Flu, it could still be potentially more dangerous because it is more infectious (so it spreads faster and wider and infects more people, so the number of total fatalities might be higher). But this would be true for most new viruses until a percentage of the population has built up some immunity to it. There is no way around this and lockdowns or other measures will only delay and prolong this. The virus is not going away. And there are a myriad of problems of waiting for a vaccine which I won't get into here. I know everyone likes to talk about the IFR, but another reason I think the overall IFR is not a good tool to use is because of how massively age-stratified COVID is. If you do want to use IFR, it is better to use the number relating to your specific age bracket, especially since you mentioned they like to target people in your age group. Latest numbers from the CDC are:</p>
<p>0-19: 0.00003%</p>
<p>20-49: 0.0002%</p>
<p>50-69: 0.005%</p>
<p>70+: 0.054%</p>
<p>And no, I don't want to kill grandma, but keep in mind that there is a reason that life expectancy in the USA is 78.54. It is the average age people are expected to die. Some people die sooner, some people die later. My province has a COVID death bracket for 90+ and 33.4% of total deaths are in that age group. Is no one dying of old age anymore?</p>
<p>Anyway, I doubt any of this will change this person's mind. It sounds like they have confirmation bias (something we should also be cognisant of when looking for information online). "The Social Dilemma" may be a good documentary to watch and reflect on how we use social media. But your rebuttals may help others who are on the fence and reading the information he is putting out there, by providing them a more balanced view. So, keep up the good fight. </p>
<p>Good luck :-)</p>

        <p>The annual flu's IFR is also heavily age-stratified. The CFR for the flu every year is 8-9%. It's so horribly disingenuous that the media has made the public belief that the CFR is the actual mortality rate of this virus.</p>

        <p>My gut tells me this IFR is really close to the final number. About 1/1000 people who get this disease will die. </p>
<p>Obviously this number is not high enough to justify the lockdowns so the Doomers will do crazy mental gymnastics to keep their worldview intact. </p>

        <p>Okay... the key to this discussion is to ignore the person - you’ll respond to their comments but you are writing for everyone else, NOT to persuade that person. </p>
<p>In which case </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>provide sources for everything and keep pointing out the data </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask simple, friendly questions that have answers that are incompatible with covid being a flesh-eating species killer </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>specifically question any reasoning presented. She says using a median is inaccurate - why? Use confirmed cases as denominator for IFR - why? She’s essentially demanding to use CFR instead of IFR - why? CFR and IFR are long-used metrics, and IFR has always been used to measure the true risk of a disease - why does she want to change that, and on what basis?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep everything short and very sweet and link sources whenever possible. This is important: you’re writing to persuade the audience, not that person. To do that, you need to make a better impression than she does: optimally, your comments will be friendly and direct and sourced, while hers will be a bit ranty.</p>

        <p>According to research on T-cells, actually double the people who are showing antibodies have developed T-cell immunity specific to covid-19. </p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mOB3pzl">graph</a>,  <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770758">from</a>, you can see at which stage different immune responses happen with covid-19.</p>
<p>So, what happens with up to half of people, according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200716-the-people-with-hidden-protection-from-covid-19">BBC</a> and <a href="https://news.ki.se/immunity-to-covid-19-is-probably-higher-than-tests-have-shown">T-cell researchers</a>, is that the T-cells have dealt with the infection before antibodies are even needed. Hence, 50% will never show antibodies, according to known data.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 50%, they will show different levels of antibodies. And these have a half-life of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2025179">36 days</a>. In France, 85% of the deaths to date happened by May 15, 2020 and yet only 22% of the total recorded cases happened by then. May 15, 2020 was 145 days ago, or just over 4 half-lives to the end of the main wave. So, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%. At most, the average person has only 6.25% of the original antibodies from the first wave, and 50% of the people infected never developed any.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that antibody studies are vastly undercounting the number of people who already were infected by covid-19.</p>

        <p>Personally I wouldn't bother, people will not be swayed by science or data, they believe the authorities and literally no evidence to the contrary that you put in front of them will help.  It's a waste of time and energy. If they are coming to you with an open mind, then sure, put some studies in front if them, but don't try to convince people, it will not work unless they are ready to be convinced.</p>

        <p>This. It's just a huge waste of time and energy, and not worth the extreme levels of anxiety and stress it brings. These people just don't want to look at anything that challenges what their cult is saying. Anything that goes against the false belief system that's been inculcated into them for the past seven months is tantamount to blasphemy. The only people you could ever hope to get thorough to are people who are starting to question the narrative and sense that things just don't add up. The cultists aren't going to budge until their overlords in media, government (and other authority figures like the media-anointed "experts") literally reprogram them to do so. Just like they reprogrammed them to be afraid of this virus and believe it's an unprecedented plague that required turning the world upsidedown, back in March...after two months of telling them it isn't much more dangerous or deadly than the flu and there was nothing to worry about.</p>

        <p>I thought we were supposed to trust the WHO, but now that they release data showing that its not as bad as we originally thought, they turn on WHO. Interesting</p>

        <p>You don't hear them talk about the IFR very often in the media, which is probably as good an indication as any that it's not as high as initially thought. If it were as high as 1% or 3%, you'd never stop hearing about it.</p>
<p>All this being said, I don't think the IFR is really relevant beyond the order of magnitude. The important thing is that it's heavily dependent on age and prior health.</p>

        <p>IFR is extremely relevant. For decades, it's been the gold standard in studying and understanding contagious disease and epidemics/pandemics. Just because the world went into a mass psychosis back in March and decided to throw out all reliable science, it doesn't mean that science and data is no longer relevant. It is just as relevant as ever. Actually even more relevant than ever, in an insane time like this, when the media and powers that be are nefariously pushing a false narrative, and the populace is too ignorant to call them out on their bullshit.</p>

        <p>I think for the general public it's only useful for understanding their personal risk. If it was flat across age groups, then I'd agree with you to a greater extent, but as it is, it's highly variable. So depending on the age and general state of health of your demographic it's going to vary quite wildly. Therefore proclaiming an IFR as if it's some constant of nature is a misguided exercise. </p>
<p>But if you can normalise it over the population, you can get a better idea of how many people have had the illness. That to me is why it's useful, not as a way to quantify risk but to determine the phase of the epidemic and how close we are to the magic HIT. As we all know on this sub, the case numbers are for the most part bollocks and heavily dependent on the quantity of testing, but generally the deaths are more reliable; if somebody's got covid  with symptoms and they then die within a month, chances are the infection contributed to death - even if it just hastened it.</p>

        <p>The "risk factor" isn't an accurate way to look at it at all. The same can be said of other respiratory illnesses, like the flu, or common cold. Those viruses have never been "flat across age groups" either...no respiratory virus is. IFRs are not to determine "personal risk". In fact, the ignorance and misinformation about IFR has many people thinking covid is a death sentence just because they are in a certain age group...this leads to more misguided thinking like "lockdown the elderly". It must be understood exactly why IFR is higher for the elderly...IFR being higher for the elderly certainly does not mean that your personal risk is greater <em>only</em> because you are a certain age.</p>
<p>The flu and even common colds have mortality rates that are a lot higher for the elderly, yet IFR has always been the gold standard to understand how these viruses are mild and the public generally understood that, hence you didn't have this mass hysteria and sanctimonious "save grandma" bs, and everyone knows that the flu has a 0.1% IFR...even though for the elderly it is much higher than that. But the 0.1% number is in fact what matters most...both for scientists who study diseases...and for the public.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is a very common cause of natural death for the elderly, hundreds of thousands die in the US every year, and millions worldwide, from some type of pneumonia. And none of these hypocrites ever shed crocodile tears about "protecting the vulnerable" over that. </p>
<p>Second, it is important to understand <em>why</em> these respiratory illnesses have a much higher IFR for the elderly. It is erroneous to view it simply as "varying wildly". Rather it must be understood the actual reasons <em>why</em> these relatively mild respiratory viruses have a much higher chance of causing severe symptoms or death for a 90 year-old than a 30 year-old. It is because elderly people generally have weaker immune systems as part of aging. And also, because elderly people are far more likely to have advanced/late stage serious illnesses. </p>
<p>The healthier,  80 year-old with a decade+ left to live isn't going to get anything more than mild symptoms from covid. The frail and ill 80 year-old with multiple comorbidities is at an actually significant risk of developing severe symptoms and/or dying. An 80 year-old in fairly good health, with no significant serious ailments is not going to die or get seriously ill from covid. A 55 year-old who has late stage cancer has a high risk of doing so. Finally, it is important to understand that the IFR for the elderly is about the same as the mortality rate for natural cause death in that age group. </p>
<p>For example, the IFR of covid for an 88 year-old might be 15%. But 88 year-olds already have a 15% chance of dying from natural causes every year, just by being that age. So this virus isn't really causing a significant increase in excess mortality at all. For a virus to justify even a fourth of this insane and absurd response, there would have to be 1. Significant risk of death across all age groups that is not age related...i.e. people with normal immune/health statuses being in serious danger and 2. Significant excess mortality...millions of people dying in this country that otherwise would not have died anytime in the near future. If a virus had a 5% IFR, it could do that. A virus with a 0.5% IFR (which covid's IFR is most likely below that) definitely cannot. </p>
<p>This is why IFR is the single most important number in understanding any pandemic, and this was accepted science until March of this year, when for some bizarre reason, everything got flushed down the toilet and you have "experts" disingenuously acting like this is some mystical alien virus that no previous knowledge applies to.</p>

        <p>Read the following article speaking about the 6% deaths from Covid admitted by CDC.  A guys does a great breakdown on the #s.  This death rate is highly over inflated and also, we know that much more of the population has had the illness.  Research studies/articles for that. https://www.bizpacreview.com/2020/08/30/enron-level-scandal-cdc-reports-just-6-of-covid-19-deaths-occurred-in-people-without-comorbidities-966362</p>
<p>It’s tough business going against the mainstream media, the censorship of large tech companies, and the mass of statists.... keep up the good work!</p>

        <p>Most of these people don't even read their own studies and if they do they don't know WHAT they're reading or how (in the proper context). Lately I've been exclusively using their own studies to disprove how <em>"deadly"</em> it is. You can most likely do the same since half of them will admit they have incomplete data and that they've had to make massive assumptions to make up for it. One admitted the conclusion was heavily biased but only because of the limited sample size (WTF right?!) which means those funding them wanted a specific outcome and to avoid liability they put the disclaimer. Have fun! I know I do! :-)</p>
