    <strong>I'm so sick and tired of my friends supporting this shit</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, this is my first post on this sub. I've been lurking for a while but I really got pissed off today and needed to get stuff off my chest.</p>
<p>I was talking with a bunch of my closest friends, and they've all gotten the first vaccine shot, and talked about how "painless" it is and how they don't understand the big deal. Now, I really don't believe in any of this vaccine shit, or how it's gonna "make things better" and "eradicate COVID" (what a joke), and I've been having trouble voicing my opinion. For some reason, I decided to actually say that I don't plan on getting the COVID jab.</p>
<p>Immediately, they start making fun of me, saying that I'm way too paranoid, and that I need to chill out. Then, one of them has the audacity to bring up the fact that one of my family members is immunocompromised, and that I should be doing this for them, not for me. </p>
<p>This has been the breaking point. At work, people keep on talking about this goddamn vaccine, like it's some sort of gift from God, and how they hope to get it soon. I'm just so sick and tired of hearing about this everywhere I go, and I feel so alone and isolated. This sub has honestly been a saving grace, and just helps remind me that I'm not alone in thinking that people need to have a choice when it comes to their health. </p>
<p>P.S. Sorry for the rant... I just need to get this out of my system.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed... get better friends.  Confronting a similar issue myself.  I am not so much bothered by friends believing what the media and "experts" tell them but intolerance for people who dare question the orthodoxy of what to me bears the stench of propaganda is cause for me to back away.</p>

        <p>They are brainwashed.</p>
<p>One of the saddest things about this year, has been losing so so so many of my friends.</p>
<p>However, and this may give you hope.  I've also met some new friends.  Some very unexpected alliances and relationships. </p>
<p>We can go back, but we can start again.  When we start again, I want to make sure I'm surrounded by strong, independent thinkers.  Not these pathetic sheep.  </p>
<p>I won't lie I've lost an enormous amount of respect for the people still going along with this nonsense.</p>
<p>Maybe it's better we aren't friends anymore. I have almost nothing but pure contempt for these people now.</p>

        <p>Exactly the same thing here. These last 14 months have been some of the most difficult I've ever experienced and it’s forced me to take a REALLY deep look into myself to try to figure out what my values are. I most definitely am going to surround myself with independent thinkers rather than just anyone that is friendly to me. It’s frankly scary what some of the people that were close friends have been saying and doing despite everything I've done to try to help them see the error of their ways.</p>

        <p>I've actually been friends with all sorts of different people over the years with widely differing opinions. I think it keeps our conversations interesting. This time though, it’s so much more than different opinions. I've studied history and what we are currently going through is scarily similar to transitioning into eras of dictatorship or totalitarianism. For me, <em>that</em> is something I cannot accept, no matter who it’s coming from.</p>

        <p>It has been really eye-opening indeed.</p>
<p>It turns out some people really were just fair weather friends.  It turns out many of them are just in it for themselves, and don't really care what you're going through.  It turns out many of the people you loved and trusted will support tyranny, but only if it makes them look good, only if they get some sort of an advantage.</p>
<p>But like you said, there is a silver lining.  It turns out still there are other people, people maybe you didn't know well.  People maybe you thought were a little bit on the edge.  People who you never really considered much before, who turn out to be future friends, and strong allies.</p>
<p>The wheel has turned.  We are waking up to a new world.  Let us commit to ourselves to give our positive energy and time to those around us who are genuine and who care about the world.  Not the fair weathered friends; the ravenous authoritarians.  Embrace the fact the mask has been turn asunder to reveal their true nature.</p>

        <p>Holocaust, segregation, sexism, gay bashing, genocide...</p>
<p>All these things happened with popular support from the public, often through propaganda indoctrination. It's no surprise it's the same now.</p>
<p>Congratulations, if this was Nazi Germany you would be hiding jews. Your friends would report them, is it surprising that you can't agree with them on that?</p>
<p>Can't be helped, find new friends and just wait it out. It's a matter of time before the side effects become clear (and there will be, trust me), and this will be known one of the biggest disasters in history.</p>
<p>I always cringe when I see people post on Facebook the "I'm doing my part" pics, but they never suffer the consequences of their actions, at least not directly. This time they will.</p>
<p>It's important not to fold to peer pressure until then, that's what the system is designed for. As long as they don't force you, don't give in. And if they do... Jewish people had fake papers you know.</p>

        <p>Lurker here as well, and I'm going through the exact same thing. Except more with my family. My mom keeps trying to shove getting the vaccine down me and my husband's throats, and it has gotten so bad I have decided that once the vaccine for children is out I will not allow my mom to watch my kids unsupervised because I don't trust her not to take them down and get them vaccinated without my consent. (She's very manipulative and sneaky so yes this is something she would do.)</p>
<p>I feel for you OP 100%. Most people just suck, except for the people in this reddit.</p>
