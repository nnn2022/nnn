    <strong>Deadliness of Covid-19</strong>
    <p><p>I'm interested in people's opinions on the deadliness of Covid-19. Obviously it's regarded as a virus that kills extremely vulnerable people and the reasoning for lockdowns, mask wearing etc can feel moot because such a small proportion of people are significantly impacted by this.  The ways in which people/governments have reacted has ended up changing the basic ways of life for those minimally effected. Is that the general consensus for people here?</p>
<p>More simply: Do the majority of people here recognize the deadliness of the virus to certain people or are there people here wanting to bring merit to the concept that the virus as a whole is fabricated?</p></p>

        <p>Not anything to worry about UNLESS you have preexisting medical conditions. Certainly not enough to quarantine healthy people in their homes. Something no one has ever done in the history of the world. New York where I’m from is supposed to be the top second state in covid deaths. Yet not anyone I know or have talked to knows anyone that has died from covid. They know people that have gotten sick, and all have said it was similar to a cold. About 25 people in a nursing home where I worked died of covid though, quite possibly because Cuomo forced nursing homes to accept covid positive patients. They were actually going to dig into all of the corruption until all of a sudden he got a shit ton of sexual assault allegations. Perfect timing I would say, the whole thing is just so fucking crooked. Don’t even mention hospitals being incentivized to diagnose people with covid. I would say that if covid wasn’t mentioned we would have thought it was a bad flu year. Completely over exaggerated and politicized to fearmonger the public into accepting mail in voting without having it approved by any state’s legislatures.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree that there has been an exaggeration at times. Don't forget that both corrupt and (lesser) corrupt individuals will be involved here so don't discredit things simply because of other things going on at the same time. You're implying that he was accused of sexual assault to cover up the corruption? I wish I could believe that the US government was orchestrated enough for this and although I don't disagree that there are crooked parts, not all parts are trying to manipulate this to misrepresent covid.</p>

        <p>no real consensus here on these questions other than “the usurping of civil liberties in the form of undemocratically and tyrannically imposed societal lockdowns and mask/vaccine mandates which violate classical liberal principles that form the foundation of the Western world ought to be fought against relentlessly in defense of said (ostensibly, at least) free world”.</p>
<p>everything else is up to the individual (existence of covid, vaccine/mask effectiveness, etc).</p>

        <p>So you're led by the ideology of fighting imposed rules that you feel violate your ability to live in a free world?</p>
<p>Do you feel that there is some validity to these rules or do you simply disregard them as corrupt/imposing on rights? Would you maybe have preferred a recommendation from your government possibly? Their advice on what to do and the ability to ignore it if desired?</p>

        <p>my preferred recommendation: “here are the risks that we know; here is what we don’t know; here is the data we used to derive these notions - make of this what you will according to your own risk tolerance; we will support those in need, otherwise, panic is unwarranted; the overwhelming majority of you will be unaffected; we will continue to research, share findings and offer recommendations to the most vulnerable”.</p>
<p>the global mandates over the past year were driven completely by fear, and not science. all the RCTs on masks showed they were ineffective at “stopping the spread” - that hasn’t changed. sweden is the case and point, along with places like Florida and Texas which have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt NPIs don’t affect seasonality driven, influenza like illnesses - there are simple interventions, preventative measures, treatments that prevent hospitalization; lack of comorbidities, low body fat (80% of c19 hospitilizations or worse, the patient is overweight or obese), supplements, HCQ/Ivermectin etc, all proven to prevent severe illness and promote immune health <em>without</em> the need for a vaccine. </p>
<p>vaccine risk outweighs infection risk for the vast majority of people under 60. </p>
<p>lock down was literally <em>unfathomable</em> prior to CCP propaganda in early 2020.</p>
<p>this was ALL FEAR, not science, it is not who we are, it is not in keeping with american tradition (or, for that matter, western tradition). it’s ineffective theater that doesn’t save lives and in fact costs them...in the name of saving them*.</p>

        <p>The WHO estimates that 750m people have been infected by covid based on antibody test results. <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626">https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/covid-19-world-in-for-a-hell-of-a-ride-in-coming-months-dr-mike-ryan-says-1.4370626</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>750m infections based on antibody tests at a time where we had 1m deaths. So, 1/750 death rate, but less deadly over time and with treatments. This of course represents the sickest members of society who have a rather short life expectancy without covid.</p>

        <p>How could it be that many? Are some getting it and not even knowing?</p>
<p>I get sick a lot from other conditions, so could I have had COVID already when I thought it was a rheum related flare? LOL Now this gets really confusing.</p>

        <p>Most are getting it and not even knowing. Not that surprising, even of those who do know they got it, like 85% don't have any symptoms and they only know because they got tested. </p>
<p>Even those who do get tested, many times the test will give a false negative.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357">https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357</a><br>
\&rt; False negatives, however, are more common. According to PHAC, approximately 98 per cent of patients tested within two days of their exposure will still get a negative result from PCR tests. That number drops to 50 per cent over the first five days post-exposure, and 10 per cent after that until symptoms disappear.</p>
<p>If you look at how the body handles covid, many people don't even get antibodies because their body kills covid before antibodies are needed. Some get antibodies, which come with symptoms, but even they are often not tested or show negative.</p>

        <p>Certainly to some degree. Just that Covid-19 is framed as exponentially more deadly than lesser serious viruses. So applying a blanket rule to all 'deadly to vulnerable people' isn't quite appropriate here I don't think.</p>

        <p>It's obvious that it can be a "deadly <em>complication"</em> to the elderly and to people who are already sick or have other underlying issues, such as obesity - which is itself just a general state of poor health.  </p>
<p>Even that being said, I believe (it's been a while since I checked - so don't quote me on it) that even among the elderly and most vulnerable, the IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) wasn't even extremely high.  </p>
<p>So no, I don't believe the virus itself was "fabricated". At least not in the sense that it "doesn't exist". I do believe that it was "fabricated" in the sense of being created deliberately at the WuHan lab. Whether it was released on purpose, or by accident, is less clear to me. It could go either way, given what I know about China (I lived and worked there for a number of years). Their government is both incompetent and malicious. So in all reality, it could have been an accident due to pure negligence, or it could have been on purpose. I would not be at all surprised if they had intended to create a virus that was meant to target a specific population. Culling their own elderly and sick population seems to be right up their alley, to be honest.  </p>
<p>But like I said, that's just my speculation. I do lean heavily towards the idea that it was created in the lab, but I can't be 100% certain. Assuming that's true, I'm about 50/50 on whether it was released on purpose or by accident.  </p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm of the view that the reaction of <em>our</em> governments (mainly in reference to North America and Europe) was...a goddamn clusterfuck. Giving them the benefit of the doubt still paints a picture of gross incompetence across the board. They overreacted horribly and made nearly all of the wrong decisions. Locking everything down and essentially crippling the economy was flat-out idiotic. The correct decision would have been to protect the vulnerable, period. It was known from the outset that it was only a "deadly" complication for that segment of the population. Which happens to be a segment that is already by and large not an active part of the work force (retired or not working due to illness).  </p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the reaction was more insidious. Used as a deliberate power play. Psychological manipulation of the population on a massive scale in order to exert more control under the guise of "public safety". And now things like "vaccine passports" and "tracking" to allow normal everyday activities is somehow an acceptable thing to a disturbingly significant portion of the population. Which is just disgusting to see.  </p>
<p>The truth is usually somewhere in the middle, though. So it seems highly probable that it was a combination of government incompetence, and a number of opportunistic players within said governments taking advantage of the situation. Unfortunately, even if this is the "truth", it has still done tremendous damage, and has absolutely caused far too many people to buy into the "new normal" of straight up tyranny.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your response. I disagree with you on the idea that it was potentially created in a lab and either was released on purpose or by mistake. What do they stand to gain from that? And granted them might just about be able to silence it for long enough but for what? A biological weapon that destroys inevitably that ends up destroying their own people seems very much up the path of a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>We also know that it mutates and that other less serious variants have existed in the past so it seems less plausible that a government would take that less serious variant and change it into something to go through part of its population to only target and kill those that are vulnerable (unless maybe that part helps keep it a secret but then why bother at all?).</p>
<p>I agree with you that it was a clusterfuck but I disagree on the rest of your paragraph ultimately. Had they shut borders down early on would you not have felt that would have been efficient? We know that viruses spread quickly because of air travel so had they simply stopped flights temporarily then I feel the rest of the things you are critical of would have been unnecessary. </p>
<p>The idea also that the elderly are removed from the workforce doesn't quite work as a) Plenty of elderly people still do work and b) That those who do work could have had contact with those elderly people anyway. Had we 'overreacted' earlier on then we could have protected elderly by reducing contact with people where appropriate.</p>
<p>I particularly agree with your second to last paragraph. I feel that it is wildly misplaced in how they're treating it now and it's all too little to late to make meaningful change.</p>

<p>Well, as I explained, I base this stance on the fact that I lived and worked in China for years, and am quite familiar with how their government operates (additionally, I might add, their poor human rights track record is already well-known anyway). They would absolutely see it as advantageous to cull segments of their own population in order to free up resources. The elderly and disabled are viewed as a drain on the state. And strictly speaking, that's not even incorrect. And I don't think it needs to even be stated that a country like China would be keen on developing biological weapons to use against their enemies.  </p>
<p>There are also ongoing Senate hearings in regards to funding that was provided to the WuHan labs for "gain of function" research. Which is basically enhancing viruses to make them more contagious and/or deadly. This is not a "conspiracy theory". It is an ongoing investigation. In no way is this outside the realm of possibility. You can disagree that this was what happened, but you can't dismiss it outright at this point.  </p>
<p><em>&rt;&rt;&rt; I agree with you that it was a clusterfuck but I disagree on the rest of your paragraph ultimately.

<p>Hmm. Well, I didn't say anything about shutting down borders. But I know President Trump tried to do that early on, and was basically pilloried for it (as usual) by the Democrats and the media. Shutting the borders down indefinitely wouldn't work anyway. It would still result in crippling the global economy. Some countries are basically self-sustaining, or at least capable of achieving that. Some others, not so much. Japan comes to mind. Population of nearly 150 million crammed into a space smaller than Texas, and with mostly mountainous terrain. They cannot sustain themselves, and rely extremely heavily on imported products.  </p>
<p>Though, as I recall...I am pretty sure that several countries (mine included: Canada) actually did shut down international travel for a time. Heavy restrictions remain even now, and have been in place since nearly the beginning. Obviously, it didn't work.  </p>
<p><em>&rt;&rt;&rt; The idea also that the elderly are removed from the workforce doesn't quite work as a) Plenty of elderly people still do work and b) That those who do work could have had contact with those elderly people anyway. Had we 'overreacted' earlier on then we could have protected elderly by reducing contact with people where appropriate.</em>  </p>
<p>Sorry, but you're wrong on this, full stop. I thought it was obvious, but I guess I shoulda put in some hard numbers. I went ahead and looked up the demographic information and did some quick math. Note, this is based on US stats, though they are likely roughly similar to other Western nations.  </p>
<p>Percentage of US population over 70: 8 million (rounded up)<br>
Percentage of US population over 70 in workforce: 17%<br>
17% of 8 million = 1.4 million<br>
Total number of employed people in US: 156 million (rounded up)<br>
1.4 million = approximately 0.083% of the total work force in the United States.  </p>
<p>This is a tiny, almost negligible fraction of the total work force. The vast majority of people over 70 absolutely are not part of the regular work force, period. Isolating them would not have had anywhere near the impact on the economy as the widespread total lockdowns did. It would have cost far less to also provide this fraction of the population with some additional financial aid to help see them through. As opposed to cutting checks for the otherwise healthy people who could have been able to continue working, had this been handled more effectively.  </p>
<p>Now the US is facing down "stimulus" and "relief" plans that, if passed, will cost upwards of ten trillion dollars between now and 2030. They've already spent nearly $500 billion, at least based on the info I could find.  </p>
<p>I'm glad you agree with some of what I said, but I think you were just a little too dismissive of my other points. Calling them "conspiracy theories" and such. I don't think that's fair at all. And the fact is (as I demonstrated with raw numbers - feel free to check the information yourself if you want), the portion of the workforce over 70 (which is the most vulnerable age group) is extremely small. Protecting and them would have had a drastically smaller impact on the economy, and would have also required far less in the way of taxpayer-funded relief.  </p>
<p>The best thing to do about it <em>now</em> is basically to follow the examples of the various states that are simply opening back up, ditching "the new normal", and getting back to how things used to be. Or as close to it as possible.</p>

        <p>I think I partly agree with you. There certainly has been a fudging of numbers in an attempt to exaggerate the situation. Has this been in an attempt to try encourage people to more strictly follow guidelines? Maybe that's why. I think that there are plenty of real cases where people are experiencing long term health impacts from Covid but there are also plenty of people who have experienced it like a common cold.</p>

        <p>first of all, a positive result from a rt-pcr not test cranked up to 45 cycles, absent symptoms, is not a medical case.  so there is that.</p>
<p>giant fraud right there... just following the new 'rules' and 'protocols'.</p>
<p>then they misstate the actual 'case' count by agrregatiing the 'cases over time, yet do not aggregate the population...</p>
<p>so for example, when they count 7 days of all cases, (92% of which are 'asymptomatic and require no treatment at because they are not sick) , they do not aggregate the population by the same 7 days</p>
<p>another fraud by mathematical sleight of hand</p>
<p>then there is the new rule (march 2020) of listing of covid as the primary primary cause of death and not the 2.8 chronic, underlying conditions as they do with all other 'infectious diseases', no 'test' is even required</p>

        <p>I'm not in total disagreement with you. I would be wary not to get yourself into an 'echo-chamber' here however which I get the impression. Looking at these numbers critically is absolutely fair but I don't think this is mass fraud designed to simply misdirect people. There's plenty of factors that contribute here I feel and that (although maybe not as bad as they make out) is still significant enough to look at the numbers with some validity</p>

        <p>We've had theraputics to combat the virus from the start but was put in the back burner to push vaccines. If this would have been tackled correctly instead of trying to make President Trump look bad a lot less people would have died. All the people shoved on ventalitors too early and the nursing home fiascos. Personally heard stories of doctors not prescribing hydro or other means because they weren't allowed to. Our goal should have been to combat this virus not political reasons</p>

        <p>You don't think that President Trump made himself look bad? Sure people accelerated the things he said/did but I don't think that the way people made Trump look had a significant impact on how this was tackled. Certainly a worldwide decision was made to pursue a vaccine where more therapeutical treatments might have also been worthwhile pursing but I think it's possible that one/some of the factors for that decision was political although I don't think that is exclusively the reason.</p>

        <p>If there was another alternative to the vaccines which there was... Why politicize and discount them just because the president mentioned them. He took a cocktail and was better in 3 days...said he'd never felt better. We are in a trial phase of vaccines which we have zero long term effect data in. These medicines he took have been around for a long time with known side effects. But because Trump said they worked they weren't used. That's a sad state of affairs for our medical field</p>

        <p>Last I saw around 3.5 million deaths worldwide have been attributed in varying degrees to coronavirus. In 2016 between 2 and 2.5 million people died worldwide from respiratory infections. Considering this "pandemic" has been going on for about a year and a half that sounds about right. Having said all that, I believe coronavirus is real, but it's nothing substantially worse than normal cold/flu. I had it in February and lost my sense of smell like nothing I've experienced. It was strange. But I was otherwise just really tired for four days or so.</p>
