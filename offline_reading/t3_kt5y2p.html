    <strong>Irish Health Dept forced to admit in court CV 19 virus doesn't exist</strong>
    <p><p>Here is a video from 12/27/2020. A court in Ireland refused to provide evidence of isolate (laboratory isolate) of the Sars-cov-2 virus. Specifically, the court acknowledged that it had no evidence that the virus had ever been isolated (purified from other biomaterial) by anyone in a laboratory. In other words, the court stated that it has no evidence of the existence of a scientifically obtained strain of this virus.</p>
<p>websitethatredditremovesstartswithBITandrhymeswithPARACHUTE /video/LjCLRqJpxlXK/</p>
<p>In addition to refusing to provide scientific evidence for the existence of the sars-cov-2 virus, the court also failed to provide the scientific justification for the mandatory wearing of masks, social distancing, and, of course, vaccination.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the second half of the video, very reasonable questions are asked:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- what kind of vaccine (or preventive drugs) can we even talk about when there is no causative virus of the "disease"?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- what kind of "coronavirus" mutations are we constantly being told about by the so-called "scientists", if there is no virus isolate?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And many others.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, the global financial capital does not care about all this and will continue to force its narrative as if nothing had happened. In November WHO officials were still shamelessly appealing to the statements of the Chinese authorities (dated 07.01.2020) about the alleged isolation of a new virus, as well as to the WHO statistics concerning 60 million "confirmed cases" and more than 1.4 million deaths "from covid" as proof of the "existance of the Sars-Cov-2". <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pandemic-idUSKBN2862DL">https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pandemic-idUSKBN2862DL</a> .</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In other words, WHO officials are only referencing the media and themselves...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They got tangled up in their own lies. For example, back in mid July, in a COVID-19 diagnostic instruction published on their official website, on p. 39 it was explicitly stated that they were testing PCR on some surrogate/simulation of the sars-cov-2 virus. Because they simply didn't have the real virus in their laboratory in Atlanta, one of the largest in the USA. How is that possible? How is that possible that they are ordering to clean driveways and public places, presumably because virus is everywhere, yet they don't have it in their largest labs? Well, the answer is simple and I think you know it already.</p></p>

        <p>Can you imagine - having to prove to people in Middle ages that plague exists during a plague outbreak? Or even having to prove to people that there's regular flu going around during a flu outbreak? I can't.</p>

        <p>The "fact checkers" keep saying that it does it exist and it's been studied. Yet labs apparently don't have isolates of the virus. You'd think that major labs around the world would have these isolates and be studying them quite extensively.</p>

        <p>I know there are people out there that are of the "I don't believe it unless I see with my own two eyes"-type. </p>
<p>But really, the first entity that provides an isolated virus sample is the first entity to admit to working on it. It will most likely not happen.</p>

        <p>Can you explain why it's not isolated? Is it that it's not needed for the vaccine development work?</p>
<p>And how do they test antibody reactions, I thought you needed and isolated virus for that.</p>

        <p>You can just use the virus that is in (or on) an infected cell. Isolation just means removing the virus from from any biological host. Basically a solution with just virus in it.</p>
<p>I don't actually know what having pure virus would prove or what the people asking for it are going to do with that knowledge.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting this. We need more people with knowledge &amp; access to courts all around the world to ask these exact same questions! As more people die of the glorious "vaccine(s)" the sheep will (hopefully) start to wake up and ask questions. The whole thing is beginning to stink more and more as time goes on!</p>

        <p>So, this is a legitimate question. If Covid is not real, what is causing people to get sick?
I had Covid in July. I am a healthy female in my 30's and has the worst "flu" i have ever had. No taste smell for a week, horrible body aches, high fevers, mild pneumonia,  vomiting, all of it. 
Granted, i was fine within 10 days (i was on 2 types of antibiotics, albuterol and steroids)</p>
<p>I feel like covid IS real, but it was created intentionally.</p>

        <p>A very important question indeed. Let's answer it step by step. 1) "I had the worst flu I have ever had" A very well-known effect of mass propaganda is that people begin to experience the feelings, sensations and events described in the mass propaganda as their own. In reality, that flu could have been the worst flu you have ever had because your immune system was considerably weakened, but it also could be a regular flu. 2) "No taste or smell for a week" Here is a BBC article in Russian called "Life without smell" (you can translate it through deepl.com) https://www.bbc.com/russian/science/2015/08/150826_vert_fut_life_with_no_smell . Loss of smell is actually a common symptom during a heavy cold or flu etc. It happens because of the swelling of the nasopharynx. Nothing extraordinary about it. It's just that no one paid any attention to it before. The loss of taste comes from the fact that without a sense of smell, a person only perceives 5 tastes - sour, sweet, bitter, salty, 'meat taste' (I forget the name). Take away a person's sense of smell and food loses significantly in taste. The sense of smell provides tones to taste, changes it. There's a very close connection.The nerve endings are all interconnected in that ear-throat-nose region. I recommend diving into the otolaryngological literature (from previous years, not written during the "covid crisis), you will see for yourself that such symptoms as loss of smell and taste during ARVI have been very well known before. 3) "horrible body aches, high fever, mild pneumonia, vomiting" All of these symptoms are completely ordinary companions of heavy respiratory diseases. In reality, these sound like nothing compared to bronchitis I had a few years back. When I had bronchitis, I was waking up in the middle of the night <em>because I couldn't breathe</em>. Coughing was such a torture I literally thought I was going to die from it. And I was also fine within exactly 10 days in the hospital. There is nothing special about the symptoms you listed. 4) "I was on 2 types of antibiotics, albuterol and steroids" Just as I thought, the medical treatment you received only made things worse. It probably was the cause of your having the worst flu of your life, not the flu itself. Hormonal steroids weaken your immune system and are dangerous during acute viral respiratory infections. The coronavirus swindlers say that steroids might help with the "cytokine storm", but since we now know that there is no actual virus - what exactly are those claims about the "cytokine storm" based on? If they haven't even isolated the virus, why do they claim it causes a "cytokine storm"? If your do some research, you will find out that there is actually no scientific ground for this claim. The studies that claim that hormonal steroids might help with the "cytokine storm" have not been peer-reviewed. Immunity supression is the main purpose of hormonal steroids. Antibiotics also supress the immune system and they are designed for bacterial infections, not viral ones. They should be prescribed very carefully during a viral respiratory disease, only if it has been confirmed through lab analysis or through green snot that you actual have bacterial infection on top of the viral one. So you have received treatment that was supressing your immune response. Of course it felt like hell. Nothing suprising about that. 5) "I had covid in July" How did you know you had covid-19? The PCR is not designed for diagnosing diseases, according to <em>its creator</em> Kary Mullis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLU4Udx5XYM So let's say you just had a regular flu. Is it uncommon during summer? Yes, actually, flu is a seasonal disease. But you can get it in summer too, if you create the perfect conditions for viruses inside your body. What are the perfect conditions? Number 1 - the weakening of the immune system. Stress, panic, drastic change in daily routine, poor diet, not enough sleep, lack of movement and lack of exercise, sitting inside confined space filled with stale air, wearing a cloth on your face which is gathering microbes, bacteria and fungus on it (completely anti-sanitary!), the "disinfectionary" stuff that they are spraying in public places, the disruption in the normal functioning of hospitals, inaccessibility of medical help etc etc etc - all these contributed heavily to rise in respiratory infections. In other words, the unprecedented "quarantine" measures and the covid hysteria in general have caused people to get sick, not "covid-19" which doesn't actually exist.

        <p>I compared it to a flu only because i never had a flu, ever in my 30+ years. 
I actually couldn't taste, sour, bitter, spicy nothing. It was funny day one.
The body aches were very severe and felt like my bones were on fire. </p>
<p>I only started steroids after pneumonia was present. 
I used to have a lot of bronchitis is the past and this was nothing like this. I never had a cough with covid either. </p>
<p>I am very skeptical and consider myself a woke person and very open minded..... it's just in my experience with this, I believe it is true that covid is real.
I do not let fear of media interfere in my life. </p>
<p>Im still trying to figure out why covid and more into the fact it was released purposely.  Who did it and what is the end game.</p>

        <p>You didn't really address any of my arguments. This is called demagogy. Steroids supress your immune system and are especially dangerous during pnemonia. You'd had bronchitis, but you had never had flu?..  Body aches are a common symptom during a heavy respiratory infection. Again, nothing exclusive here. Covid doesn't exist, because PCR doesn't diagnose diseases and the virus hasn't been isolated.</p>

        <p>Does anyone know ANYTHING about the actual details of the antigen test? I can't find any published research on in aside from articles comparing it to the PCR test. All it know is it checks for the presence of antigens but says nothing about the mechanism by which this is achieved or what antigens specifically are being tested for.</p>
<p>I assume it's a case similar to the PCR test, where it tests for something that can be found in the presence of a number of different diseases, but I'd like to understand the science.</p>
