    <strong>How to deal with mask confrontations</strong>
    <p><p>Just had my first mask confrontation, trying to calm down. I don't seek confrontation or to make some statement- since April (when masks became required in my county) I've worn one in stores and even occasionally outside in crowed areas (though I think it is stupid.) I'm from the Bay Area and on vacation in Santa Barbara which had seemed less mask crazy. I was riding a bike with my family on a beach path, we pulled over to buy something from a vendor- my son put on his mask to make the purchase while my husband and I stood next to our bikes on the grass maskless. Suddenly some woman walking by (at least 6 feet away) turns just to me and says "Excuse me - in Santa Barbara you need to wear a mask in public!" I could see at least a half dozen other people not wearing masks (and many, many more on the beach and coming down the path.) But she chose to single me out.</p>
<p>I was kind of shocked and unprepared so I said "I'm riding a bike and I'm nowhere near you, feel free to stay away from me Karen!"  She said something about the law and "Go back to LA!" </p>
<p>When we got back on our bikes we passed her on the path and I said "Hey, mask patrol, there's lots of people without masks, better go do your job!" She said "No, it's just you!" When again there were literally dozens of people around without masks, but I guess she didn't want to confront families, groups of teens or the homeless, just a white middle aged woman that she didn't think would fight back?</p>
<p>OK I know I am overreacting and my response wasn't good, so any ideas of a better way to react if this happens again?</p></p>

        <p>I do the exact opposite: I'm smiley and make sure to make eye contact. I think it throws people off and destroys the narrative that WE'RE the Karens.</p>
<p>I haven't yet been bothered (hope I didn't just jinx it) but if I was I think I'd just keep on doing what I'm doing and kill 'em with kindness.</p>

        <p>Smile and say “I’m exempt, thank you for your concern” and move on. It’s just not worth even trying to interact with these people. Swallow your pride and disarm them with politeness.</p>

        <p><strong>You can either:</strong></p>
<p>A - Say "Sorry, I'm medical exempt". You don't need to prove it or share your medical history. Especially not with strangers who aren't part of the police force.</p>
<p>B - Pretend you don't hear them. If they starts waving their hands at you or touch you, you should first point on your ear, shake you head and then gesture pen and paper. Unless they bother writing down their point, you can just walk away. People not communicating properly doesn't deserve your attention.</p>
<p>C - Make up a short story on why you don't wear mask if you bother. E.g. you've a phobia because of X and Y happen. Some may understand and learn something new. If they continues shouting, you can just walk away. Ableist people aren't worth your energy.</p>
<p>D - You can just come up with a freedom argument.</p>
<p>E - You can just ignore them and hopefully they won't bother you.</p>
<p>There are many options out there.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I don't have a medical exemption but that is one of the things that has really bothered me about the mask mania. It seems to have been completely forgotten that there are people with legit medical exemptions, for either physical or mental conditions. One story (and I'm sure there are many like this) that really got to me was from a woman who had been in an abusive relationship where her partner would cover her face- masks induced PTSD. I can't imagine how awful it would feel to be that person and have some busybody confront you about mask wearing, thinking they are being a good person.</p>
<p>BTW my 12 year old suggested saying "Thanks for being a local hero!"</p>

<p>There's many mental conditions out there: Autism, PTSD, anxiety and claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Some physical disabilities may be: Auditory processing disorder, CP, quadriplegic and general mobility issues. </p>
<p>The first mentioned are the inability to understand spoken language without context like no facial expressions meaning phone calls are hard. The others are mobility issues making it hard to dress and undress yourself making masks a hassle.</p>
<p>Linguistical needs: E.g. people who've sign language as their 1st language or relies on lipreading.</p>

        <p>I have auditory processing disorder and I can confirm that it is impossible to understand people who wear a mask and when wearing a mask. It’s like being in a foreign country where they speak an entirely new language. I also can’t handle when the mask is covering my nose and mouth because my biggest fear is to be choked to death and because of this I can’t wear turtlenecks or chokers. So when I do wear a mask, I literally am constantly holding it away from my face.</p>

        <p>I have PTSD from a past assault in which my mouth and nose were covered. I panic when I wear anything over those areas at all. This mask BS has made life completely miserable. I’m constantly harassed or denied entry to stores. I will say I’m medically exempt but usually those harassing me don’t care so I’ve had to resort to “suck my maskless dick” once or twice to get the leave me alone point across. I’m so over this.</p>

        <p>There are two objectives here:</p>
<p>1) Prevent a confrontation.</p>
<p>2) To carry on your maskless way and refuse to be bullied.</p>
<p>It's a delicate act to manage the two.</p>
<p>Faced with someone like the Karen you encountered, I would simply ignore them as though they don't exist. This makes it clear to others around you that you are not the aggressor here - any escalation is now on Karen. <em>That being said, never turn your back on them. Be ready to defend yourself.</em></p>
<p>If they choose to "engage" further, and you have made it obvious that you aren't the aggressor but you refuse to be bullied, things get murky.</p>
<p>You may be able to verbally deal with it, or it may get physical. Get your phone out and make it obvious you are filming them. Do not allow yourself in a position where you will be alone and without witnesses. Watch to ensure that other Karens/Kens don't join the fray, <em>and watch for any sign there is a weapon.</em></p>
<p>Personally, at this point, if I had to physically defend my right to be left alone and not be bullied, I would do so, with only enough force to make Karen/Ken stop their violence towards me.</p>
<p>That, of course, depends on physical ability and comfort level.</p>

        <p>Not saying anything and just staring at her would have been interesting. I wonder what she would have done? I also wonder if she has done this before and what kind of reaction she expects to get..."oh thank you. I had no idea, I'll put on on right away!" </p>
<p>It's funny because I'm not a particularly strong physical person but this woman was at least 10 years older and 8 inches shorter than I am, so if there was anyone I could take physically it would have been her!</p>

        <p>My bet: you were standing alone (at least away from a crowd of observers) and she thought, for whatever reason, that you looked like someone she could bully.</p>
<p>In that case, ignoring her is definitely the best move. The type of person who “picks” someone who looks like an easy target is looking for a confrontation that is easy and feels like a win. </p>
<p>Simply ignoring her makes the difficulty level of the confrontation skyrocket, and she’ll back off quickly in most cases. On the other hand, anything you say is encouragement for her to engage. Silence. </p>
<p>Also, while it is really easy to talk about this while sitting safe at home, it’s really hard to handle it in the moment. You did a great job and you should be proud of yourself. </p>
<p>While I’m sorry it happened at all, I’m happy that you got the chance to stand up for yourself - now you know that you <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> stand up for yourself, and that is an important thing to know.</p>

        <p>Yes, my husband was also maskless, but he was facing me a few feet away and with his back to the path. Doubt she would have confronted him, a 6'1" muscular, athletic guy. Lots of other maskless people but mostly in groups. </p>

        <p>What’s odd is that in CA, if you read the “mask mandate guidelines” or whatever on the official state website, it states that masks are required outside when you are waiting in a line, or when you can’t be 6’ away from others (plus a variety of other instances related to working outside). I still think it’s ALL bullshit, but somehow everyone has taken this to mean, “at all times in public” which is simply not true. </p>
<p>Part of me feels very sad for the people who are so scared, but the rest of me is filled with boiling rage knowing that the government made up some arbitrary guidelines and then realized that social media and the terrified and confused public would just take it from there and do their job for them. </p>
<p>A while ago, someone on here gave their best response to being hassled for not wearing a mask which is still my favorite: a simple “I’m not sick”.</p>

        <p>That's how my town mask mandate reads. Ours even goes one step further and states, "a mask is not needed when momentarily passing someone."  Also, children under 10 and anyone who has a medical or psychological reason for being unable to wear a mask is exempt. Either nobody but myself actually read the mandate or people in my town love to virtue signal(which is most likely) but I see toddlers with masks, people walking alone with masks and people reading out in the park with a mask. People will also pull up their homemade shitty cloth mask while they're passing you (if they dared to have it down) as if they're actually in danger from that 2 second outside contact. It's nutso. I had an old lady scream at me because I wasn't wearing a mask outside downtown.</p>

Also, the law in SB is the same as in my county and I was not breaking it. I was no where near six feet of any person not in my house when I was confronted.</p>

        <p>Since I'm interested in how the virus spreads (everything I have read shows it is close, indoor contact), can you show me the data that the virus is spreading because "tourists keep bringing it here?" That would be great info to have!</p>

First article: IV has been on lockdown and anyone throwing parties is faced with possible eviction, but out of towners keep coming here and trying to party </p>
<p>I’m trying to find the second article but it compares SB number of cases by population to Goleta, and Montecito and we see way higher Cases per thousand in SB than Goleta and Montecito because tourists keep coming here and spreading it.</p>
<p>Yes it’s not that infectious or even that deadly but if everyone could just be respectful and start wearing masks, socially distance and stay home we can start to drive our numbers down. </p>
<p>This could have been solved in April if our administration weren’t downplaying it and told everyone to stay home.</p>

        <p>LOL I wasn't partying in IV, I was riding a bike with my family and wearing a mask while indoors or on crowded State street. NO ONE is getting the virus because someone briefly rides by on bike. Or because someone is standing maskless no where near others (which is where I was when confronted.)
You seem reasonable, unlike those who are now swearing and harassing me, so I'm sure you understand that families riding bikes are not an issue.
And everyone did stay home in March and April (of course not "everyone" because society would have ceased to function), It's a virus, it is magical thinking to believe we can just make it go away by hiding.</p>

        <p>I mean look at Japan they all wear masks no matter what and they numbers are heavily down, same thing with places like New Zealand ( no cases they don’t even have to wear masks). Once someone close to you passes away maybe you’ll understand. It’s not that infectious outside but still it is. The death rate is like 1% that’s still 1 person out of a hundred that would be dead if we could be more responsible as a society. Also not really most people didn’t stay indoors in March and April. The government could have really shut everything down besides like power plant workers, healthcare, pretty much just public services everyone else stay home give free rent and free food delivered to you on your doorstep and I guarantee the virus wouldn’t of had nearly the impact it did</p>

        <p>People in Japan wear masks on public transportation and in crowds, not while riding a bike or jogging. I'd be fine with that, but the mask nuts like in this situation just take it too far. Not that cloth masks do much, you might be interested in this, straight from the cdc (there has only been one RCT regarding cloth mask and health care workers who wore them suffered MORE infections.)

<p>While biking on the beach bike path it's effectively required as you can't feasibly maintain 6 feet distance and the exercise exemption only applies if you are maintaining that distance.  I don't go to that part of town so I don't know how closely people are following it.</p>
