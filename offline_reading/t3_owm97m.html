    <strong>Remember to take care of your health in order to continue avoiding the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>So, we all know whats going on in certain countries: without your papers, you're not allowed in all types of places, including hospitals. While its important to keep fighting the good fight, you need to remember to stay proactive. You won't need to worry about if you need to get the shot if you don't need to worry about going to the hospital or clinic.</p>
<p>Its getting easier to avoid fast food places that are taking government money hand over fist to promote the vaccine (looking at shitty Mcdonalds and Dunkin Donuts). Most people here know to take the vitamin list: D3, A, B12 (and 6), K, E, and zinc are the big ones, but you can do more. </p>
<p>Mushrooms have had a big moment the last couple years; use that to bump up your knowledge. They were the first antibacterial and they work in a way that combats a lot of viruses as well. This is a natural way to help your immune system so you can keep resisting. I'm not just talking about magic mushrooms (although they have been proven to help fight depression if you're looking for alternatives). I'm mainly talking about reishi (which is the easiest to grow at home), lions mane, turkey tail, and other ones you might have already heard of. </p>
<p>I'm not a health professional and this definitely should not be considered medical advice, but its something I'm interested in since I have no interest in going to another hospital to be pumped full of drugs. Here's some articles on the stuff above, thanks for reading.</p>
