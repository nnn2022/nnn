        <p>At this point in the lockdown, nearly 100% of pro-mask or pro-lockdown posts I see on social media are women in their 20's who either have an OnlyFans or openly broadcast their instability for all to see. </p>
<p>Today I watched one boast about a mini-meltdown she almost had at the store because someone stood too close to her in the store, then in less than four hours proudly revealed to Instagram she blew $500 on Pokemon cards. When these are the people trying to shame others for not wearing masks it becomes really hard to take the whole movement seriously, just like every other movement they align themselves to.</p>
<p>I have a pretty wide mix of people on my social media and none of the small business owners or stronk, independent men partake in this charade.</p>

        <p>This has not been my experience at all. Maybe my girlfriends are cooler than yours? I've lost tons of male friends though. They can't handle someone having a different viewpoint and get hostile pretty inexplicably. I call such men: he-bitches.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that most men who support this have visible symptoms of low-T: high body fat (skinny-fat or fat-fat), high-pitched voices, soft features, emotional dysregulation.</p>

        <p>“In societies of whatever description, however narrowly or broadly de­fined, women as a class are the dulled conformists, the orthodox believers, the obedient followers, the disciples of unwavering faith. To waver, whatever the creed of the men around them, is tanta­mount to rebellion; it is dangerous. Most women, holding on for dear life, do not dare abandon blind faith. From father’s house to husband’s house to a grave that still might not be her own, a woman acquiesces to male authority in order to gain some protec­tion from male violence. She conforms, in order to be as safe as she can be. Sometimes it is a lethargic conformity, in which case male demands slowly close in on her, as if she were a character buried alive in an Edgar Allan Poe story. Sometimes it is a militant con­formity. She will save herself by proving that she is loyal, obe­dient, useful, even fanatic in the service of the men around her. She is the happy hooker, the happy homemaker, the exemplary Christian, the pure academic, the perfect comrade, the terrorist par excellence. Whatever the values, she will embody them with a per­fect fidelity. The males rarely keep their part of the bargain as she understands it: protection from male violence against her person. But the militant conformist has given so much of herself—her la­bor, heart, soul, often her body, often children—that this betrayal is akin to nailing the coffin shut; the corpse is beyond caring. “ Andrea Dworkin, Right Wing Women</p>

        <p>The one and only time someone actually screamed at me for not wearing a muzzle was a teen girl in a coffee shop. Shit was wild.</p>
<p>Women are conformists by nature, and their hive mind takes a massive shit on anyone who is considered "low status."</p>
<p>If the media and celebrities started assigned low social status to people who wear muzzles, women would immediately flip and do a 180 and start screaming at people for wearing them.</p>
<p>The female hive mind is a terrifying thing. If they don't have a rational male authority in their lives, they literally go feral. They have to submit to something, and many women in our society have decided that submitting to big daddy government and the insane leftist orthodoxy is the way to be.</p>
<p>I think it's a holdover from caveman days when women had to submit to the tribe to stay physically safe. If they stood out in any way, they could be rejected by the tribe and forced to raise a baby on their own.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm aware there are exceptions. But it's like 99% of women support this and maybe 75% of men. And most of those "men" seem to be low-T (skinny-fat or fat-fat). Testosterone levels have been dropping for decades now, and many men are adopting female traits. It's scary to see.</p>
<p>Any women who are reading this and getting offended: it's because you know that it's true. Do something about your fellow women, because they are destroying our society from within.</p>
