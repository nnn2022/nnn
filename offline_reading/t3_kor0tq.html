        <p>It is the actual consensus. I am a healthcare worker in Canada and deal with this kind of behavior semi-regularly. </p>
<p>Newsflash. The majority of people you count on to provide life saving medical care despise you if you act like this. They'll still try to accommodate and provide care out of a professional and ethical obligation (which it sounds like a couple docs in this video tried to do) but please know they probably hate your guts.</p>
<p>Personally I was wearing a mask for extended periods of time before  COVID came around because it was already part of normal droplet precautions to protect the patients around us. And I can also personally go downstairs and look at how the second overflow morgue we added is now also overflowing. How do you think I feel when guys like this roll in? </p>
<p>Jihadists killed some of my friends. I spent a large portion of my adult life training to fight them. I think I have more respect for their human decency at this point. This is not hyperbole.</p>

<p>So a consensus? Cool. </p>
<p>You also realize that I'm talking about the context of a hospital and whatever "echo chamber" I'm in would consist of 99% of the actual professionals who work there too right?</p>
<p>&rt; How do you think I'm in an echo chamber?

<p>I don't want you to die. I just want you to follow some basic hygiene and dress code rules when you're around potentially very vulnerable patients in the hospital. </p>
<p>&rt; Tell me again to leave my "echo chamber."</p>
<p>This place is an echo chamber. If you are looking for an idea of the actual general consensus, which was what I was talking about, then you won't get it here.</p>

        <p>Oh we have a misunderstanding. I was talking about the general consensus of people demonizing people who refuse to wear a mask. Specifically the people in the reddit comment section of the video.</p>
<p>I don't doubt she would ask someone to put on a mask at work. Doesnt mean she cares, Doesn't change the fact that asymptomatic spread is a myth and you only need to wear a mask if you are sick.</p>

        <p>And people definitely don't deliberately lie when visiting the hospital to get access to people and areas they shouldn't because they are a) selfish, and b) think it's all made up because of FB research. Right? Except I've seen dozens of cases where people do exactly that, up to and including doing it to visit patients in the ICU and leaving fake contact info for the contact tracers.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people <em>probably</em> have a shorter window of being contagious, and many who are past that window are <em>probably</em> still shedding enough material to be picked up on a test. That's a long way from definitively proving that asymptomatic transmission is <em>confirmed busted</em>. </p>
<p>And again, there's all the people who will tell you they're fine while hacking a lung out because they don't want to be inconvenienced. If you're going to be around vulnerable patients, you're going to wear a mask because I don't fucking believe you and the morgue is already too full.</p>

        <p>I'm not worried about me, mostly. I'm worried about all the other patients who are potentially vulnerable because of the sicknesses or injuries that, you know, brought them to the hospital. </p>
<p>Most of us aren't vaccinated because the supplies aren't there yet. The other patients in the waiting room, ER beds, patient care units, and ICU almost certainly aren't vaccinated. </p>
<p>I don't know if you're being facetious about masks right now, but no, the idea is to protect you a bit, and others from you a bunch more by reducing the amount of saliva and mucus droplets you're putting out into the air. So it doesn't matter if I'm wearing PPE, I still want you to wear a mask in the hospital. </p>
<p>I know someone is now going to chime in that masks don't stop everything. Well yes, and body armor doesn't completely protect an individual soldier from getting hurt either. But armies have figured out that issuing most or all of your troops body armor still makes a big enough difference in the amount that get seriously wounded or killed to make a strategic difference. We are dealing with a group scale issue. </p>
<p>As for my attitude towards people who don't wear a mask, well look at this situation. Even in a setting full of vulnerable people, where masks were common even before COVID, where multiple medical staff and cops have explained why, this fellow is still causing a ruckus and being selfish. And people here support this apparently. </p>
<p>After seeing the same thing happen so many times I've lost count ... why wouldn't I assume not wearing a mask is because the person is selfish and unreasonable? Many will say they oppose masks in general as an overreach, but in the one setting they make the most sense they object or cheer on others who do, so frankly, I don't believe them at all.</p>
