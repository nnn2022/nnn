    <strong>How Stupid Do You Have To Be?</strong>
    <p><p>It drives me crazy when people say something along the lines of “You anti-vaxxers/covidiots/conspiracy theorists get your information from YouTube/Facebook/the internet.”</p>
<p>Yes. You know what’s on the Internet? PubMed, Google Scholar, and literally every fucking higher education institution and scientific research journal … have you heard of “online learning?” Do you know who censors the information shared by those you condescendingly label with a Facebook/YouTube “degree”? Facebook &amp; YouTube! FFS!</p></p>

<p>I only use Reddit and I don't use it to get info but to converse with people.</p>
<p>I research via government datasets, papers, journals, and try to see what media is prattling on about.</p>
<p>Half the shit they print is outright lies and the other half has no idea how to interpret the data and simply end everything with "TrUsT tHe ScIeNcE".</p>

        <p>I guess that is because the internet is the dumpster of ideas and you need to sift through the detritus to find the valuable information that is there. Unfortunately most people don't know how much they are not knowledgeable about how things actually are and unironically believe that they're superior to people who do see the truth and have true knowledge and think that people like us are the problem. It's quite mad. The world is completely ridiculous and black is white and white is black according to the mainstream narrative. Unfortunately these COVIDcult morons are going to pay for their ignorance and pride with their lives. Such a unnecessary tragedy but I guess that that's the way it is in a fallen world.</p>

        <p>OK but do you not ask yourself why 99% of health workers who live this stuff are pro vaccine? Are they all being paid off? If you're right then at least some establishment Doctors and nurses - solid people the one's I know - would speak out? But there are hardly any beyond the fringe tiktok crowd.</p>

        <p>There's a million different ways people can speak out. YT, newspapers &amp; reporters would be queueing up to publish a story with cfredible evidence. Think what you will about big media but there's not a journo alive that wouldn't expose something as big as this if they could prove it.</p>
<p>Your argument just doesn't face the fact of reality. Hell if you had proof of this you'd send it to me or publish here. </p>
<p>Suspecting something exists but never seeing it - that's some odd thinking.</p>

        <p>because corporate media, with agenda
compatible slants, still influence more total people, especially the “educated” than the number of people doing youtube/fringe internet reading.  my opinion is many in the educated class are outsourcing their thinking to the prestige periodicals like nyt and the atlantic, and the fact that those havent blown any whistles is enough for many of these people, who are busy enough with work, and studied so hard to get tk their positions, that I honestly doubt they spend their spare time reading and thinking about health, and like i said, are casually reading the nyt, as if the nyt is purely informative, unbiased and objective truth, and that conversely, anything right leaning is Koch brothers influenced “tobacco is healthy” misinformation.   blue good, red bad.</p>

        <p>this.  its a great career, often with lots of debt but a great income and potential for non 5 day work weeks.  why trash that when its obvious this all is less bad than initially hyped, which kind of makes less people want to blow the whistle, since from the our skeptic vantage point, its all so obviously not the end of the world, and should blow over as soon as the political needs are met.</p>

        <p>I do get your line of thinking, but all of them? It just seems unlikely. </p>
<p>And the blue/red comment - even the top of the Republican movement -  Trump and everyone around him - had the vaccine at the first opportunity. They didn't crow (much - Ivanka was the loudest iirc) about it because they know how it sits with some of the fringe anti vax supporters, but actions speak louder than words no?</p>

        <p>do you really think its a)easy and b) consequence free for american medical practitioners to pop off with their true feelings on covid?   doctors have a highly privileged profession with an especially high income.  why would they throw that away because they have an opinion they think is “right?”</p>
<p>there is also the many that have publicly commented,  or the published research showing the ineffectiveness if not outright destructive delusionality of lockdowns and masks.    this sub and r/lockdownskepticism have many many accredited experts blowing the whistle every day.  </p>
<p>the thing is its hard to know the exact numbers when there is so clearly a bias
among the powerful and their affiliated corporate media to push the shot, so its hard to know what kind of pushback or true numbers there really are with the “vaccination rates” especially since these very people have been so bloody wrong about so many other facets of covid.</p>
