        <p>I wanted to re-upload this video to Youtube with subtitles, but it won't let me because of copyright. So here is the translation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>But Sean, what is the name of this superb remedy against the very dangerous virus that will kill us all?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is called, the paper mask!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paper mask?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But, the paper mask of what?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paper mask that will save all our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow! But how does it work, the paper mask? Sean, a demonstration! Sean, a demonstration!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh la la, I am in the subway, and everyone around me has the killer virus! My God I will die! Oh, if only I had ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The paper mask!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oooh, that's it! I already feel I'm cured! It's extraordinary, this paper mask saved my life! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, thank you the paper mask! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very easy to use, the paper mask is produced for 5 cents by little Chinese children, and sold for only 20 USD the pack of 10. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That's it, it's finished Sean, if you want to survive send your checks to the World Company! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Bob, who will be stupid enough to buy paper? All that for a flu that is weaker than the normal flu. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Roseline Bachelot, French health minister of the time) Hello! I would like to order 100 million masks. It's for France. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations, I see Madam knows her business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh yes, I'm health minister so ... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's go for 100 million! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what do you say? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you the paper mask!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In case you are wondering "why" or "who" would do this kind of predictive programming.</p>
<p><strong>WHO</strong></p>
<p>Canal+ is owned by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré; his maternal grandmother, Nicole Goldschmidt, was a close friend of Edmond de Rothschild, who is the main shareholder of the family business. To say Bolloré is part of the occult powers that be that rule the world would be an understatement.</p>

        <p>Very interesting link! I was just getting all riled up over how deliberately ignorant my governor was being, how it made no sense. Now it does make sense. She's trying to make democracy look really bad, like it doesn't work, and she's trying to use her power to divide us. These pols hate liberty, and they are trying to make others hate liberty too. Shameful.</p>
