        <p>How do you feel about Texas mandating the playing of the national anthem at sporting events? I see it as more authoritarian government control over our private lives and businesses. Yet conservatives are defending it because the national anthem is a good thing. Why can’t people see that any government control is abusive?</p>

        <p>Because you live in a nation that has an anthem. If you don’t like the anthem and don’t like the country, go to a country that you like the anthem and a country you like. Has no relevance to what you are saying. If you truly want to civilly disobey the government that is really taken over (playing the national anthem at this point is an actual protest) go protest in front of Deloitte, Walmart or other great reset supporters. They actually want a communist and socialist state, because then they actually will never be questioned or have a lawsuit against them. The government will finally be as one. They give the crumbs of “Caring” and manipulate to stay monopolies through the blindness of leftist policies crying that it is capitalism that is destroying everything. </p>
<p>Play the Club of Rome game and they believe they will be the final authority. No conspiracy go to the world economic forum, and while you are at it, look at the actual plan of the great reset. Democrats and republicans are no more in their eyes. They created a class and race war so their paid puppet stays in a leadership falsehood while they actually dictate. Protest with the national anthem while you can, the new one will be mandatory or jail.</p>

<p>But I won’t support any ideology that says a private business is required to perform the national anthem. The moment you force citizens to be patriotic, it’s no longer patriotism. It’s brainwashing. End of story.</p>

        <p>If you have absolutely no relatives that immigrated (my great grandmother immigrated from France and great grandparents from Ireland), never have had any relatives that fought or died for this country, never had an officer that helped you in an emergency, I can see that you wouldn’t have any respect for the anthem. You live to live and live freedom handed to you without a single thought as why. Unfortunately or fortunately there where people who DID respect freedom enough to die for people in this country, even disrespect and selfish people. An anthem is the least and laziest thing anyone could do to show respect.</p>

        <p>Strong opinion. I'm curious - clearly you're aware that this sort of authority worship doesn't exist in other countries with freedom, why do you feel compelled to do so in America? I've had people in my family die for my country's literal freedom (I mean actually to free us, not the "freedom" america attained for itself in recent wars in Afghanistan or Iraq for example) as recently as the 80s. My generation is the first in a long, long time to know peace in our country and I'm thankful for that.</p>
<p>But having a mandate to play the national anthem every time you want to go to the store to get milk? That is not the freedom my/your family members sacrificed themselves for. That is oppression. You should always be in a position to question and resist government in ALL forms.</p>
<p>Also you think these massive capitalist businesses want an economic system that would redistribute their profits? Please, educate yourself on what socialism is before you start accusing every little thing you're afraid of as being part of a socialist conspiracy. These companies may want very liberal social policy, but they absolutely do not want any changes to the economic system.</p>

        <p>Actually I am educated on socialism, unfortunately. That pipe dream of the world economic forum spelled it out clearly. And it is a total joke you believe they evenly redistribute wealth. They lie to get into power, and once in power redistribute wealth according to their mandate, not the people. And it is hilarious that you think communist China doesn’t own every factory and company within their borders and those corporate entities aren’t happy. Those corporate entities don’t face lawsuits, they have endless cheap or free labor, and they have perks for those who produce. My grandfather was military and actually lived in Cuba before Castro took over. My family was jailed in Cuba during the takeover. Their neighbors, and friends were shot or jailed. School children were shot. So yeah, I think I know just a little bit about socialism and how those idealistic nit wits start class wars, call everyone a capitalist pig and kill anyone who disagrees with them firsthand. </p>
<p>I haven’t heard of grocery stores being forced to play the National anthem. And in an atmosphere of violence being stirred up by socialist propaganda in this country, we all could really use some thankfulness and kindness when speaking about the USA. All the rhetoric about how bad everything is here is going strong, and it is not only depressing, but aggressive and vicious. Wear earplugs to a game. There is a lot more we could be offended by in the USA. Let’s try some unity and quit complaining about absolutely everything when it does absolutely nothing.</p>

        <p>Clearly you know more first hand about Cuba than me, and I wouldn't want to insult you by questioning you on a conflict if you've first hand knowledge of. But China is its own beast. I don't believe what they have there is socialism, nor is it any form of regime I'd wish to live under. I'm not American, although I did live there for a few years while I was younger and (pre covid) I used to travel over about once a year for work. </p>
<p>It's very different to what I'm used to. My forefathers fought and died for a more idyllic class based form of socialism that would have been the cornerstone in over throwing our bourgeoisie coloniser. We got rid of them mostly, but we never reached the end goal of a true socialist republic. Maybe it's for the best, we'll never know. But it does somewhat upset me that so much blood was shed for the goal to only be somewhat attained. I'm sorry to hear about what your family went through under Castro, having history like that in the family so recently is something that most people will never understand.</p>

        <p>FYI that is always the lie that hooks people, “Never fully realized socialist republic”. When it doesn’t work (which it never does) that tired phrase is always used. Forcing people to “Live equally” as their rulers micromanage everyone, and keep the power untouchable is not a utopia. It’s like trying to catch a cloud in your hands. Almost there, yet never realized.</p>

        <p>I’m having a little trouble parsing what you’ve written. Are you suggesting that because the private enterprise got tax incentives to build their business in that state, the government should be able to control their speech? That’s an interesting idea. </p>
<p>But where do we draw the line? If we get some kind of tax credit, are we then obligated to curtail our free speech? How much is giving up that right worth?</p>

<p>your brain is so fucked with lolbert garbage you can't even separate your individual self from the interests of giant corporations</p>

<p>you have no "rights"; rights don't stop the state from doing anything which is what you should have learned throughout this whole hysteria fiasco</p>

        <p>False. Whataboutism is a way to <em>justify</em> bad behavior by pointing out the bad behavior of someone else. I was asking OP if they condemn government overreach in all cases, or only when it’s control over our lives that we disagree with. </p>
<p>How about you? Do you tolerate the government telling you what to do, if you were going to do it anyways?</p>

        <p>&rt;the technique or practice of responding to an accusation or difficult question by making a counteraccusation or raising a different issue.</p>
<p>I’m not doing that. I’m responding directly to the issue OP raised. How do we handle government control? Do we tolerate it, just because the method of control is inline with our political ideology?</p>
<p>If we are okay with that type of government control, then it’s not control we’re opposed to, it’s just an opposing ideology we reject.</p>

        <p>This is unfortunately my fear as well. The lab trials do not end well for any of the primates they injected with these new vaccines. Many died 1-2 years later. Antibody-dependent Enhancement is a serious problem that was stuffed under the rug. The only studies you can find about the vaccines and ADE say "is not an observed problem". Yet.</p>

        <p>okay. i think that's why this vax is supposed to have no/lesser risk of ADE... because it's against only the spike protein which is common to all strains.</p>

        <p>Just read it.  That study never said that it was an mRNA trial that ended with the death of all rats.  Now, this may be lost on you, but sometimes they kill the rats on purpose to study them post-Morten.  Not sure what your point is posting this study, but clearly you don’t understand it.  In fact, it proposes a safe mechanism for vaccine delivery in a rat model, and theorizes an mRNA delivery.  I think you just shat all over the point you tried to make.  You’re way out of your league, kiddo.</p>

        <p>Sorry son, when you're doing a post-mortem on subject animals you list that the test animals are euthanized first, including what was used.  Apparently you're not nearly as smart as you think you are.  Did you bother reading the tied studies? You might have to go to scihub, even though they've never bee pulled.</p>

        <p>&rt; all the microchip/5G conspiracies</p>
<p>if you believe that this is an actualy stance then you fell for the media bullshit hook line and sinker.<br>
those completely irrational conspiracy theories are only pushed to discredit any other form of resistance or counter argument.<br>
its a psychological trick.  </p>
<p>this is the hardest step for most. coming to realize that EVERYONE has an agenda.<br>
instead of outright dismissing something as a conspriracy you should rather ask yourself why you are made to believe that the other side are idiots or bad people? and are they really?  </p>
<p>talk to others and LISTEN to them. don't judge. listen to their arguments. accept them as people and then make up your mind about their views. don't outright reject them.<br>
we are all people. division isn't helping regular citizens. this has to stop.<br>
tolerance also means tolerating others opinion.</p>

        <p>What the hell is this garbage sub. Where are you getting your news that vaccines are killing people you weirdos. Throughout the history of mankind diseases such as polio and and measles have been eradicated by vaccines. Literally the states that reached the vaccine levels needed to reach herd immunity have opened back up. NYC is a party again! What ulterior motive do you think there is for the government to spend so much time and effort vaccinating the public?? What do you think there is a tracking device in the vaccine as if anyone gives a shit about whereabouts??(btw your phone is a tracking)Do you think they are killing people because I can tell you first hand ever since the public became vaccinated the rate of hospitalization has gone way down. What kind of inbred dumbass train of thought do you guys follow?</p>

<p>pick one.</p>
<p>keep in mind that Belarus never had lockdowns too.<br>
just look at how case numbers dropped in those countries and compare that with countries with high vaccination rate.</p>
<p>you will not be able to tell a difference.<br>
I added germany as an example</p>

        <p>Belarus also has comparatively large hospital capacity, better isolation for the elderly due to lack of care homes, relatively low population density overall.</p>
<p>And due to extremely low confidence in the somewhat authoritarian government people took matters in their own hands.</p>
<p>I'd have added countries outside eastern Europe to the comparison...</p>
<p>More importantly why are you trying to extrapolate generalities from an outlier?</p>

<p>6 "outliers".</p>
<p>there are several outliers. if you only trust the nations that did hard lockdowns and refuse to lift them then obviously you won't ever see it.  <br>
you can compare US states with each other if you want.<br>
https://www.covidchartsquiz.com/<br>
someone linked this quiz in this sub here recently.<br>
try it and see for yourself. </p>
<p>&rt; Belarus also has comparatively large hospital capacity<br>
hospital capacity has nothing to do with case numbers or reproduction rate.  </p>
<p>&rt; I'd have added countries outside eastern Europe to the comparison...<br>
then go ahead and do it. theres not many countries with very low vaccination rates except africa. and I doubt that you'll believe those if you already refuse to believe Belarus.</p>
<p>you got information right infront of you and try to close your eyes to it.</p>

        <p>But do you really think the long term effects are worse than getting the disease itself? My parents were nurses and witnessed first hand that in the heat of this thing there were a lot of New Yorkers dying. There is literally a girl in my office who has yet to regain her sense of smell after recovering from covid. Yes this vaccine was developed very quickly but that’s because the world poured an unmatched amount of time and resources into the production of it. Again I’ll choose the top scientific minds of the world over self proclaimed health gurus.</p>

        <p>We don't know what the long term effects are, so we can't currently make the assessment as to whether any risks of the vaccine outweigh the risks of coronavirus.</p>
<p>The sheer vast majority of people will recover from covid-19 unscathed, and currently I see no reason as to why I, a 31 year old male with ca 15% bodyfat, a resting heart rate of 44 bpm, perfect blood pressure, and no underlying health conditions should require or even risk a live tested vaccination.</p>
<p>A lot of these "top scientific minds" also have vested interests and haven't actually touched any technical science in decades.</p>

        <p>And yes I trust the cdc over a bunch of yahoos on social media. I didn’t think that would be a controversial thing to say before seeing this echo chamber. For the record I don’t disagree with everything in this sub. I do think everything in the US needs to be opened up without restrictions. At this point everyone who wants a vaccine can get one here and everyone who doesn’t want one isn’t going to get one any time soon.</p>

        <p>&rt;compares a construction worker building a building (and other irrelevant occupations) to doctors pushing a rushed vaccine with zero long term studies.</p>
<p>&rt;tax dollars are attempting to spread the vaccine far and wide as a public health measure — “healthy population = more productive population”</p>
<p>You do realize young individuals with strong immune systems are already healthy, right?</p>
<p>And have no need for it, right?</p>
<p>But you’re totally cool with tax dollars being absolutely wasted to push the propaganda?</p>
<p>Especially when it’s not even working?</p>
<p>You don’t find it suspicious that the government is literally offering people lotto (tax) money and free beers to get the shot?</p>
<p>You can do you, but that’s sketch as fuck and I’m completely good.</p>
<p>Personal experience with COVID:
Beginning in March 2020, I roadtripped through
<em>multiple</em> states. Met a multitude of families/other vacationers, ate with them, hung out with them.</p>
<p>Used incredibly public and busy restroom facilities (including shower).</p>
<p>Did not get sick once.</p>
<p>Have continued living life unmasked/unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Still haven’t gotten sick.</p>
<p>There is no logical reason to push this vaccine and burn taxpayer money promoting this nonsense.</p>
<p>Only people who “<em>need</em>” it are the at-risk folks.</p>

        <p>Give me a good reason to trust people who take money to be a political mouth peice. You honestly think these people have your best interest in mind? All they care about is their pocket books and where their next funding comes from.  Why are the goal posts always moving? Why is my mother still alive after being hospitalized this past winter with blood clots in her lungs, pneumonia,  covid,  and stage 4 cancer all at the same time? She's pretty over weight as well. Shouldn't she be dead? Why is she still alive if this virus is so deadly? Let me guess,  modern day governments and organizations would never dare be corrupt right? That must be all in the past.. please sign me up to take a "vaccine" that only reduces your symptoms and from a company that has zero liability from being sued shall any side effects occur.  Yes, please sign me up.</p>

<p>they will extend this until next fall<br>
low case numbers will not lead to lifting of restrictions<br>
vaccines will become mandatory (to live life regularly)<br>
they will go for the children next<br>
they will push the vaccines hard before summer (before seasonality hits)<br>
correlation to vit D levels and COVID cases will get little coverage<br>
lockdowns are more harmful than good<br>

        <p>No worries. I was unsure if a "stay at home" order was the same thing as a lockdown, and am still unsure.</p>

        <p>Even if true it was from media pressure from morons and poor science.  Once they assessed the problem they readjusted.  Exactly what your supposed to do in science.  Not drag shit on forever just to act like your doing something.  So technically they did everything right.  Re act to bad science info to save lives, realize it's bad info and move on.  Not drag the shit into the dirt to act like your doing something when you aren't.  All west coast governors should be in jail.  They know they are doing nothing but drag it forever.</p>
