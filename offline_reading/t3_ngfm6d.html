    <strong>COVID Vaccines are NOT safe?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been asked many times by friends, co-workers and others why I'm so hesitant to get the vaccine. They brag about the shot they got and that I shouldn't be afraid of the jab because the "experts say so". </p>
<p>Anytime I said something like: <strong>"It's not FDA approved"</strong>, or show them that there have been <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions"><strong>side effects and deaths</strong></a> they just think of "conspiracy theories" <em>They don't even know the real meaning of the word</em> <strong><em>conspiracy,</em></strong> or think of me as an anti-vaxxer although <strong>I got all the required vaccines when I was a kid.</strong> <em>(No autism)</em> BUT I do know people who has been irreversibly damaged after receiving a conventional vaccine and I'm aware that everybody reacts in a different way as well as all the adjuvants that vaccines have. </p>
<h1>What scientific and concrete evidence can I show them to prove that these mRNA Covid vaccines are not safe besides the evidence of side effects, miscarriages and deaths reported?</h1>
<p>Btw I ask this question because some people I know believe these vaccines are "cool", "salvation", or the way to "get back to normal", thus should be mandatory!</p></p>

        <p>They CANNOT KNOW they are safe, since there is there is less than a year of long-term follow-up. For experimental genetic medicines like these vaccines, that's a huge risk.</p>

        <p>Regardless of animal testing, regardless of how much data we had before injection based on theory, WE DO NOT KNOW THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. Is it safe? Is it unsafe? We won't know for many years. Anyone that states it is safe or unsafe is talking out of their ass because human trials are not even a year old. Short term seems to point towards general safety with occasional rare side effects. Long term information DOES NOT EXIST. </p>
<p>I'll take my chances with the virus, at least we have somewhat longterm data on that..</p>
