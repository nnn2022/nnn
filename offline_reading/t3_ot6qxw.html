        <p>Technically it’s not the PCR process itself, it’s the reference string the test looks for that’s questionable.  According to stuff the CDC recently published, it frequently matches ordinary influenza in addition to covid.</p>

<p>woah, are you serious? I'd like to see a source on that. So the assumptions that many Covid positive tests were just the flu were correct?</p>

<p>They will be pulling the test from approval, and notice how they explicitly state that the replacement testing protocol should be able to tell the difference.  If the previous test was reliable, there would have been no need to emphasize that.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but it seems you are moving words around to suit your preconcieved bias...</p>
<p>Nowhere in that link does it say the previous test could not tell the difference between Covid and the flu. All it says is the new one being selected should be able to as well. Im not trying to fight you here, but if that link is your proof of your statement "The PCR test frequently matches ordinary influenza in addition to covid", it is very weak. </p>
<p>I'm not vaxxed, and I'm not a New Normal idiot, but I think we gotta be careful from just throwing around random statements that may not even be true.</p>

<li>This isn't PCR</li>
<li>This is a specific test manufactured by one company -- not a recall on all COVID tests. It was never even approved by the FDA in the United States and makes up a very tiny percentage of all COVID tests administered. The company was distributing it without approval. If anything, you should be happy the FDA is cracking down.</li>
<li>The main issue is that the test isn't sensitive enough. It's not incorrectly flagging people with COVID -- it's failing to detect people with COVID. That would lead to under-inflated case counts. It's not conflating the virus with the flu.</li>

        <p>- Stop saying "PCR", the test in the FDA link you shared is something else entirely. It's an antigen test.</p>
<p>- It's an antigen test from *one* company that has been discontinued and made up a very tiny fraction of all recent tests administered in this country. Stop trying to push the idea that all our past tests are inaccurate. Plus, it is not "mixing up the flu" -- it had a lower than desired recall, which long term could be dangerous because we'd be missing COVID cases</p>
<p>- PCR tests have extremely close to 100% specificity, meaning it's very rare they signal COVID when it is not present. They have very high recall as well. PCR is by far the most accurate type of test.</p>
<p>- "it frequently matches ordinary influenza in addition to covid." This is blatantly not true and why I commented. I still do not know where you are getting this from. I've seen this link thrown around: </p>

        <p>CDC encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season. Laboratories and testing sites should validate and verify their selected assay within their facility before beginning clinical testing.</p>

The old test detects COVID and COVID alone -- it won't tell you if the flu is present. It is a binary yes or no. The multiplex tests can check for both at the same time, so you get (is flu present, is covid present), 2 independent variables. That's what this means, and at this point you can find plenty of researchers and fact check articles and people from the CDC clarifying this point. If the old test detected flu that would be absurd, no one who works in this field thinks that.</p>
<p>"The CDC’s PCR test in question looks only for SARS-CoV-2, not influenza — which is quite different from a test that mistakenly diagnoses influenza cases as COVID-19, as the posts erroneously suggest."</p>

        <p>What in the fuck are you talking about? PCR tests have been used in medical diagnostics for 20+ years. We used it detect AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, E.coli, H1N1, salmonella, malaria, the tick-borne disease babesiosis, genetic and autoimmune diseases, and so on. More than 100 PCR-based molecular diagnostic tests have been approved for use in improving cancer care alone. The list is long.</p>
<p>&rt;The inventor of it himself said pcr test is not designed to test for disease</p>
<p>This isn't true, or at least a total misunderstanding of what he said. It looks like this claim stems from an <a href="http://www.virusmyth.org/aids/hiv/jlprotease.htm">old article from 1996</a> discussing HIV, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>"With regard to the viral load tests, which attempt to use PCR for counting viruses, Mullis has stated: "Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron." PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers. Although there is a common misimpression that the viral load tests actually count the number of viruses in the blood, these tests cannot detect free, infectious viruses at all .... The tests can detect genetic sequences of viruses, but not viruses themselves."</p>
<p>In other words, PCR tests are not great for quantitively measuring someone's viral load or determining if they're infectious or not. They can just tell you if that viral DNA is present. This is not some secret. I agree that we shouldn't obsess over raw case count, especially when there is no outward symptoms. We should care more about hospitalizations or severe symptoms, which PCR won't tell you. But it's still necessary to track case load as a leading indicator. </p>
<p>&rt;Have said they will stop using them due inaccuracy/unreliability</p>
<p>No, that's not what they said, and it doesn't take long to invalidate this claim a dozen times over.</p>

        <p>Because you're literally wrong. They are on level 1 recall by CDC, which means they're worse than useless. Any other coronavirus, of which there are roughly 160 known variants, as well as some flu strains would be registered as a positive with this test. It's completely worthless. Covid numbers have been absurdly overstated. </p>

        <p>Already said this in another comment but:</p>
<ol>
<li>That recall is not for a PCR based test, you're conflating things</li>
<li>It's a specific test manufactured by one company -- not a recall on all COVID tests. It was never even approved by the FDA in the United States in the first place and doesn't make up any significant percentage of COVID tests administered. The company was distributing it without approval. If anything, you should be happy the FDA is cracking down. The FDA cracked down on it BECAUSE we have the tools to measure testing accuracy</li>
<li>The main concern is that the test sensitivity is too low. It's not incorrectly flagging people with COVID; it's failing to detect people with COVID. That would lead to under-inflated case counts, not over-inflated</li>

        <p>This is where things get confusing. CDC says one thing, FDA says another. 2 CVS’s are not ordering more of the home test (binax). Innova PCR has been recalled as well. It’s right on the CDC site. </p>
<p>Source for my cvs comment: me. My job recommended the binax test, so I did it. Now they want a PCR, I’m doing it. I can pay 190 for a PCR at an actual lab that has same day results, or get one free from insurance that takes 5 days. Idk how people can ask me to fork over 200 bucks to go to my job.</p>

        <p>The PCR test that is being phased out (Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) -- the one we've largely been relying on -- is not being phased out because it's conflating the virus with the flu, or because it's inaccurate. That's not true, I don't know why this person keeps pretending as if it is. He's claiming an FDA "recall" as if there was something wrong or inaccurate with the test which is intensely misleading. Also, the test planned to supersede this original PCR test is still PCR based.</p>
<p>There IS a separate antigen test the FDA is truly forcing a recall for being inaccurate, however. That's not being challenged.</p>

        <p>Don't mean to be a drag, but can you quote where it says the new test is still PCR?  These articles seem to be quite dated - one is July 2020 and the other shows barely any updates from February 2021.  I have both open but I'm not finding anything - unless these are only referencing the new test?</p>

        <p>Can people not see that this isn’t about vaccines but about dividing the nation? </p>
<p>Do people really think the government thought EVERYONE would get the vaccine? They weaponized the vaccine and did it on purpose. </p>
<p>Everything is lining up perfectly, the vaccines, the easing of mandates, the reapplication of mandates, the fear and anger, unlimited new science and variants to keep anxiety up. The best part? they have someone to blame - our own people. We’re all turning on each other when everyone knew this would happen. </p>

<p>Everyone has the same opportunity. If housing mortgage rates go down, and EVERYONE starts buying houses, it’s not a conspiracy… it’s just the natural way people react to a given situation.</p>
<p>These government officials are reacting to a 0% mortgage rate.</p>
<p>More people are proven to be catching covid if they’re vaccinated. Everyone knows there will not be 100% compliance</p>

        <p>Of course you can contain a virus. Throughout history there have been quarantines, mitigation efforts and vaccines. The vaccines make is less likely that you will get or spread. It's just managing risk. Nothing complex about it.</p>

        <p>Yeah my doctor said don’t worry about it. He said I’m healthy and if I choose not to then he’s not forcing anyone. He said it could help but it has side affects. He personally said his kids aren’t taking it, and his wife isn’t either. Idk if he took it or not</p>
<p>This is my personal family doctor. I listen to doctors that know my body over political doctors that don’t know me as an individual </p>
<p>But again, this isn’t about vaccines. This is about intentional chaos and civil unrest caused by the government officials.  They knew what this would do. They knew how people would react.</p>

        <p>Yeah idk. I’m an hour or so from New York. </p>
<p>I’m a little confused though. </p>
<p>If you’re vaccinated you get the “potential side effects” and almost guaranteed immediate common side effects of feeling sick/weak etc. (they even have a subreddit discussing and empowering these side effects) BUT you can still get covid. </p>
<p>What this sounds like to me is:</p>
<p>A.) I experience covid, that’s it</p>
<p>B.) I experience vaccine side effects, risk rarer more deadly or lasting side effects, AND experience covid. AND potentially need to take boosters to counteract potential side effects or unlimited variants</p>

        <p>Lol quit editing your comments after I reply. Are you trying to make your responses more coherent after the fact?</p>
<p>Right now it would be:</p>
<p>A) You experience a deadlier and more contagious version of Covid that we started 2020 with and are more likely to be hospitalized or die</p>
<p>B) You get the vaccine and experience mild side effects but are then less likely to get or transmit the virus that's going around which means it's less likely to spread amongst the population and those who can't get the vaccine for legitimate health problems.</p>
<p>Remember, the vaccine decreases the chances that you'll experience severe covid. That's a good thing. Without it your body might not be ready to combat the delta variant when it comes around.</p>

        <p>You really want to roll those dice? We all engage is some sort of risk prevention in our everyday lives. If we didn't we wouldn't take medicine or have any type of insurance.

        <p>So would you go to the hospital for treatment? Presumably you trust your body enough not to need the hospital.</p>
<p>You realize insurance is there so that whoever fault it is they don't get wiped out by the huge costs associated with settling those cases right?</p>

        <p>It's the spike protein wreaking havoc on blood vessels, which causes the body to try and repair them by creating thousands of micro clots. The tissue cannot be repaired because of how the protein damages it, so it's permanent. People are going to have lifelong issues because of this vaccine.</p>

The unvaccinated are still sick and can’t breath.  One is headed to the ER just now.  I’m the oldest and diabetic one.  I was most at risk.  I’m fine.  The vaccine worked.</p>

        <p>Also, they're now saying that they're expecting that variants will get around the vaccine...roughly at the same time as the next seasonal uptick is expected  to begin by anyone who realized these vaccines ain't shit because they understand relative vs absolute risk reductions.. </p>
<p>It's easy to claim that most of the hospitalized are unvaccinated when it's goddamn summer time and cases are negligibly low anyway. Meh, just claim the few vaccinated hospitalized are there for <em>other</em> reasons. Anything is possible when you control the statistics. It won't be possible to hide the real situation when the season begins.</p>

        <p>CDC did update their reporting metrics on Covid or something - they won't count vaccine cases unless the person was hospitalized or dead.  That was my interpretation at least, and could very well be completely wrong.  However the bold below is why I came to the conclusion. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</p>
<p>Exact verbiage was:</p>
<p>&rt;"As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to <strong>focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause. This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected</strong> on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance."</p>

<p>Regardless, this is an expected outcome as the number of people who are vaccinated increases. If some community had a 100% vaccination rate, then 100% of COVID cases will be in vaccinated folks. So this number in isolation isn’t enough information. And it definitely doesn’t suggest you’re MORE likely to contract the disease. That doesn’t make any sense</p>

<p>"...Hirsh pointed to data released last week on breakthrough infections by the state Department of Public Health, which he called “an incredible testament to how effective the vaccines are.” Fewer than 4,500 people tested positive for COVID-19, among the 4.3 million in the state who have been vaccinated, a breakthrough infection rate of one-tenth of 1 percent."</p>

        <p>My road was nice until 2020.  I have a great career, I've traveled the world, served in the military, and then people like you began to tell me to be afraid of the common flu and passed and moaned calling everything covid (which it isnt) and spreading fear and panic, stealing rights, locking down, and forcing vaccines.  All because of a virus that caused some elderly and sick people to die last year. </p>
<p>Well that has been happening every single year for as long as we have been on this planet. </p>
<p>But you people just now decided, thousands of years later, that it was a fucking problem, but ONLY if it can be called a covid death. </p>

<p>Not the person you're replying to, but i'm complining a giant list of sources of suspect behavior and would love to have this.  Could you link it via dm or reply?</p>
<p>Other gems I have are death counts changing after the fact (Santa Monica County?), 78% of deaths are from overweight/obese, and the Techincal Briefing 19 that shows barely any death chance from Delta.</p>

        <p>Nice job of completely ignoring the entire reply I typed to you before this last one. You know the one. It's the one where I pointed out how much you never cared about a darn soul before the TV man told you to care only about those that die of a virus. </p>
<p>And here you are a year later still only caring about someone dying if you can call it a covid death. Doesn't matter if it was actually covid. You don't care about the truth if their deaths. You only care if they can be labeled as covid. </p>
<p>You haven't once given a shit about any of the children and teens who committed suicide because of lockdowns. You are way way more heartless than I could ever be. You are a true monster.</p>

        <p>Sorry I must have missed your response, I'll make sure to move you up my priority list.  I'll respond to both of your comments in this one because you seem really eager for it.</p>
<p>You're projecting every trait of the "wrong people" on to me and you're afraid.  Afraid to lose what you have and your way of life.  I'm afraid too so we should work together to stop it rather than ignore it while people die and hope it goes away.  I also think you suck up any information that makes you feel good about your decisions and clutch it like your life depends on it.  The misinformation is the warm blanket that allows you to sleep at night.  No one is stealing your rights or forcing you to take a vaccine but I seriously doubt there is anything I can say to make you think otherwise.  You have engorged yourself on the Kool Aid.  We have always cared about pandemics, I don't see how response is any different.  If anything it should've been stronger.  You start projecting again, trying to turn me into a kind of super villain.  Soulless and uncaring, when in reality you don't know anything about me or what else I care about.  My bet would be that you are projecting those things onto me and in reality you are the one who didn't care about those other deaths until it was coinvent for you to weaponize them against others.  I don't know if you have done horrible things in your life or need an evil enemy to focus your energy on but when you call me, a complete stranger on the internet, a heartless monster it just seems like someone who is hurt, sad, and afraid.  I hope my response is satisfactory.</p>

        <p>You still haven't answered me on why you never ever cared about anyone who dies of anything unrelated to covid.</p>
<p>Do you care even a little about the children who have taken their lives because they could not cope with lockdowns?  Did you care before covid about all of those that die from pneumonia and influenza?</p>

        <p>btw i wasnt involved in your debate but ill play with ya.</p>
<p>yep, always cared, which is why ive always supported the phds and scientists studying vaccines and ways to prevent those diseases. it means a LOT to me to support humanity's efforts to improve our quality of life, and medicine is a hugeeee factor in that. seems you only care to weaponize those deaths, though, when it fits your agenda. i get my flu shot, do you?</p>
<p>question along the same reasoning: if you had a chance to go back to when the yearly flu FIRST infected humans and you could isolate the spread and end it, would you? i sure as shit would, even if that meant a couple years for people to be bored at home back in the 1800s (before the internet even!!!). EXTREMELY worth it as a trade-off to people who care about unnecessary death like you, right?</p>
<p>ill be the first to admit, ill trade a few hundred suicides for a few hundred thousand deaths from a novel illness + ongoing deaths from variants for generations bc we never controlled it. crazy, right?</p>
<p>also, the goal is that we really wanna prevent covid from becoming the next annual flu that kills thousands every year, that would reaaalllly suck and add to the deaths from yearly diseases you DO seem to care about (ie, flu and pneumonia). there would be way more cumulative deaths from a yearly covid variant than the # of suicides over lockdown, EVEN if covid is as mild as your group claims. is that what you want? to trade generations of yearly deaths just for 2 years of having a marginally better life?? seems extremely selfish from my viewpoint.</p>
<p>more to that point, you say you care about the flu, many on here claim covid is as deadly as the flu, yet you dont care about covid. what DO you care about? deaths from disease in a selective manner (flu but not covid), or just getting a win in an online debate with a "GOTCHA"???</p>
<p>everything you argue for here ensures we have another deadly disease to deal with every year. think back to our 1800s example with the flu. would you prevent it from becoming endemic if you could go back in time?? if yes, heres your chance with covid.</p>

        <p>&rt;yep, always cared, which is why ive always supported the phds and scientists studying vaccines and ways to prevent those diseases. </p>
<p>You support them?  Okay, let's look at them a bit:</p>
<p>Moderna is one of them.  They have yet to produce a single vaccine that has gotten FDA approval.  They've submitted hundreds and the FDA has thrown them all out.  This one was only given emergency use authorization.  They have failed consistently to produce a safe vaccine ever.  And you trust and support them?   </p>
<p>Pfizer has been in trouble many times for hiding trial results and bribing ad agencies to promote their products as safe and effective.  Yes, this company is the current record holder for the highest fines paid.  they recently paid out $2,500,000,000.  Yes that's 2.5 billion dollars in fines for hiding trial results.  RECENTLY.  And you fully trust and support them?   This mRNA vaccine has killed so many animals that they were forced to stop that trial and completely scrap the results!  You can look it up.   Man, you'll trust anything, won't you?</p>
<p>Johnson and Johnson recently had to pay out a lot of money too because their baby powder was causing cancer due to the asbestos they knew was in there.  Their mRNA vaccine got halted by the FDA because it was causing blood clots.  It is STILL causing blood clots!  The FDA made them put blood clots on their warning label.  And you trust them?</p>
<p>The FDA had a briefing of the vaccines in October of last year and they were given a long list of known adverse affects.  You will not find these listed at any pharmacy.  These don't get advertised at all, but the proof is in the slide show presentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1XTiL9rUpkg?t=9220">https://youtu.be/1XTiL9rUpkg?t=9220</a></p>
<p>Pause it and slowly advance it as this slide was blown passed and not discussed at all.  The slide gets shown a few frames after this timestamp.</p>
<p>It's a VERY long list of some seriously horrible shit including death.</p>
<p>This is specifically about the mRNA vaccine.  These are known and were known in October of last year.  No one is being told this.  </p>
<p>THIS IS THE INFO WE PRESENT HERE ON THIS SUB THAT YOU STILL IGNORE.  </p>
<p>Sure, you sound polite, but you're just here to pick fights with us.  You don't really give a shit about learning any facts about what's going on.  You just want everyone to get shot up and hide forever in their basement like scared little sheep.</p>
<p>That's who you are.  Nothing else matters to you. And yes, I got my flu shot.  Required for my job at a hospital. But no- I don't feel I need it.  If I wasn't working at a hospital, I wouldn't get it. My immune system works.  I've trained it by traveling around the world.</p>
<p>And you're still talking about isolation:</p>
<p>This is the most contagious virus in human history according to the media.   It's so contagious that it SPREAD AROUND THE PLANET IN 3 MONTHS.  It hit every single corner of the world in 3 months.  </p>
<p>It hit every state and country around the world in three months.  It spread around the planet in three months.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know how you can't understand that.  Is it that hard for you to?  </p>
<p>I know I promised to be nice when I replied to you, but you're making it difficult.  We hit 99.99999999999999999999999% infection rate world-wide in 3 months.</p>
<p>Lockdowns happened after 6 months.  It took 6 months to lockdown to prevent the spread of a virus that spread to everyone 3 months prior.  Do you really not understand that? </p>
<p>Lockdowns did nothing because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone already got exposed</li>
<li>It takes billions of people to keep the planet running</li>
</ol>
<p>A full lockdown will kill over 90% of the world's population and you know it.  Please stop denying it.  No water, food, electricity, internet, garbage service, sewage, deliveries- NOTHING!!!   A full lockdown is impossible to survive.  You stay indoors unable to flush your toilet, get rid of your garbage, take showers, eat, drink, or communicate in any way until you die of thirst and starvation.</p>
<p>THAT is a full lockdown.</p>
<p>This virus spread so fast that it ran its course over a year ago.  It was done... over... finished.</p>
<p>and you know what? I am too.  YOU will always refuse to have a real discussion because you NEED to live in fear.  You don't want facts.  You want fear.  Enjoy your government control.  I will never do anything to make you feel better.</p>

        <p>ive never been judged for so many things that dont apply to me before. this is the definition of a gish-gallop where you throw so many half truths at me i cannot even begin to address each of them properly. ill try to, though.</p>
<p>FDA emergency approval IS FDA approval. they dont let anything through without a substantial amount of testing and the quantity of tests. all of the trial data is public, they arent hiding anything. also, funny how you dont trust anything the fda says abt the positive side, but when they say the negative side effects, you take it as full truth as ammunition for your argument. do you only care about science when it fits your pre-determined beliefs? clearly you believe the side effects, and clearly the FDA reported them in a video you yourself sent me so they arent hiding anything. whats the conspiracy here again? <em>more importantly, would you even get the vaccine if the FDA approved it through non-emergency?</em> (source: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions</a> + <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/143890/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/143890/download</a> + <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained</a> + the literal video you sent me)</p>
<p>but, sure, ill admit all the side effects of the vaccine are real. J&amp;J (which isnt an mRNA vaccine, so clearly your research has failed you quite a bit) did have blood clots, but at a lower level than covid itself causes blood clots by a factor of 8. the J&amp;J vaccine is the same type of vaccine that the yearly flu shot is, and has had more real-world testing than almost any flu shot in history. <strong>if you trust the flu vaccine, you implicitly trust the J&amp;J vaccine.</strong> (source: <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/study-covid-much-more-likely-vaccines-cause-blood-clots">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/04/study-covid-much-more-likely-vaccines-cause-blood-clots</a> (claim: covid 8x more likely to cause blood clots than j&amp;j vaccine) + <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/janssen.html</a> (claim: j&amp;j not mrna) + <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/viralvector.html</a> (claim: viral vector in use since 70s))</p>
<p>and are you saying that the flu became endemic, a yearly disease we deal with, but covid infected 99.9% of everyone on the planet already and is gone? why is the flu coming back every yr since the late 1800s but covid just happened for 3 months and disappeared? your logic doesnt make sense. covid will become endemic just like the flu because we arent doing enough to get rid of it before it gets there. ill ask again: <em>if you could go back to the 1800s and force everyone to get a vaccine to kill off the flu before it ever became endemic, would you?</em></p>
<p>even if the vaccine is as horrible as you say and has an insanely high death rate, would it not still be worth it to prevent the past 150 years of needless, suffering deaths for a handful at the time? (source about the excessive deaths from the 1918 influenza pandemic: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354</a> remember, there are no political motivations for a 100yr old cases that scientists study, and this was done in 2007, ie before covid politics started and when a republican was president)</p>
<p>also, your 99.9.....% infection rate number is just made up. i cannot find a single source that comes even mildly close to that, even on conspiratorial websites.  i havent had covid myself, as an anecdotal counter example. (according to the WHO <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</a> there have been 198,234,951 infections worldwide, and according to <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/</a> there are 7,883,548,521 people alive, which leaves <strong>2.515%</strong> of the world having been infected, a far cry from 99.99......%)</p>
<p>and yea, isolation for anything longer than covid requires, i would take up arms against a tyrannical government. im a libertarian through-and-through, i just defer to scientists as my authority on science, not government, and definitely not random news articles. im not going to run away from the fact that government having authority to shut down society is a bad power to give, but when all the scientists are saying its what we should do, im not being a bootlicker, im just listening to scientists and phds. note how my sources are mainly from academic journals.</p>
<p>if the scientists say stop lockdown/stop vaccines and the government says continue, you bet your ass ill be hollering as loud as i can about it. thats just not what is happening here- the majority of epidemiologists, scientists and phds are saying what we need to do, and i listen by getting vaccinated, social distancing, and doing my part to prevent more needless deaths (just like id do if i went back to the influenza pandemic with the hindsight we have about it).</p>
<p>but even more to this point, <em>no one is even saying lockdowns are the way at this point</em>. i go out all the time and have for a while. hundreds of cars have driven by the main road near my house as ive typed this. i dont think what youre trying to convince me is happening is actually happening. the world is running and never stopped in the manner you described. we just need to social distance and keep masks on inside until delta is better understood, and get vaccinated. <em>thats it.</em></p>
<p>but, we did have lockdowns for a period and 99% of the world didnt die, so i have no clue what youre on about there. the phds and scientists decided necessary functions of society were worth the risk of keeping running, and we did just that. i had a meal every day, electricity, internet and such, and even had a driver bring me everything i needed to my house.. arguably more convenient than ever. you lived through it, right?</p>
<p>it rly sounds like u didnt look anything up that u wrote and just went off pure emotions, considering you held down the 9 on your keyboard for a solid 3 seconds to exaggerate a point for emotional effect, because it clearly wasnt data-driven, even by your standards of a source.</p>
<p>you also never commented on the study i sent regarding deaths in the year 2020 that did not align with the prior information you gave, either. it sounds like youre not willing to address actual data, but just go off a "gut" feeling about this all.</p>
<p>if you discredit the scientific process and hold your own intuition higher than phd-educated people on fields youve never heard of, there will be no convincing you. if you do not use reasoning to form an opinion, reasoning cannot be used to convince you out of that position, as it is based on your intuition and not on empirical data.</p>
<p>i have no problem if you call me names, i promise, just use actual data rather than barfing out random numbers you KNOW you made up as you typed lol. engage with me in good faith, and i return the favor. i havent run away from your arguments, and i havent called you an idiot. please recognize i am putting in genuine effort to come to a common understanding here. if you produced peer reviewed studies and a whole slew of info i somehow missed over the past 1.5 yrs of weekly research, id immediately give that information credit. <strong>slamming the 9 on your keyboard 30 times will not lead me to consider your position in good faith.</strong></p>

        <p>Before I go any further, let me address one point- and then once we've discussed it, I'll go deeper into your reply.</p>
<p>EUA is not FDA approval.  </p>
<p>What do you think would happen if the government dropped the state of emergency right now? </p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>What would happen?   Think on it for a while.  Then answer me what you think would happen if the state of emergency ended this very moment.  </p>
<p>I'll wait.  It had better be a damn good response because there is only ONE right answer.</p>

        <p>ignoring your extremely condescending attitude:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained</a></p>
<p><a href="https://vaccine.unchealthcare.org/science/vaccine-approval/whats-the-difference-between-fda-emergency-use-authorization-and-fda-approval/">https://vaccine.unchealthcare.org/science/vaccine-approval/whats-the-difference-between-fda-emergency-use-authorization-and-fda-approval/</a> </p>
<p>an EUA is approval by the FDA. its a different process and not as rigorous as a BLA, but is most certainly highly tested and rigorously vetted for approval by multiple independent research teams and double-blind studies involving thousands of volunteers. all of this research is public (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577">https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577</a> heres the top one on google, hundreds more available).</p>
<p>if the government dropped the state of emergency based on the recommendations of scientists, there would be evidence the pandemic is over and no longer an emergency, and there would be no need for EUA-approved vaccines to be used, and we would have to wait for BLA approval. so, to answer you directly: they would have to stop using the vaccines till BLA approval.</p>
<p>but.... that makes perfect sense to me and is how it should be, right? in any situation, we assess the risk/reward of any action to be taken. if the benefits outweigh the negatives, we move forward. the vaccines arent perfect, i fully gave you that there are side effects, like literally every medicine in existence, but they pale in comparison to covid itself and those risks have been heavily assessed by people way smarter than both of us combined, hence the EUA.</p>
<p>i feel like were getting to the point where you say you dont believe in scientific studies, at which point i will be at a total loss at how to convince you of my position.</p>
<p>either way, if saying we couldnt use the vaccines until BLA approval if there were no longer an emergency is a "gotcha" then i guess you got me... but i dont see how that isnt just the most reasonable way to handle things.</p>
<p>go ahead with the rest, im interested to see how you disprove multiple vetted research papers from your living room.</p>

<p>No, what happens if the state of emergency goes away is that the Pharma companies lose out on billions in sales.  They are making tens of billions each and are on track to make even more.  They are pushing for a third dose now.  </p>
<p>They raised their prices too.  They are draining the governments and filling their pockets.  Governments are allowing this for a multitude of reasons, but the point is that the reason that we're still in a state of emergency is $$$$$$$$$$$$$.</p>
<p>FDA didn't give full approval so there is absolutely no way we can exit the state of emergency.  MONEY.  Billions of dollars to each pharma company!  THIS is what this happened.  THIS is why this is still happening.  An end to this state of emergency would mean an end to the vaccine profits.</p>
<p>"Pfizers leaked contract shows that governments cannot talk about the negative side effects of the vaccines and cannot talk about this for 10 YEARS. Governments also have to pay whether Pfizer gives them the vaccine or not. Pfizer state in the contract that they don't know if its effective or safe."</p>

<p>The were no long term studies by their own admission.  Barely any short term studies that were successful.  They even admit in this article that they cannot verify if it even works against covid.</p>
<p>And you ignore all of it.   You ignore all the people who have had their lives destroyed by this unproven and dangerous drug.   THIS is why I have been rude to you.  This is the reason I'm condescending.  </p>
<p><strong>Compassion</strong></p>
<p>Do you remember what you said in your first reply to me?  That I didn't care about people dying.  THAT is what pissed me off because you have been nothing but callous, indifferent, and downright "Who the fuck cares" concerning everyone who has been permanently disabled or even killed by this vaccine.   I linked you documents from Pfizer where they admit that this is not safe or effective and you STILL don't care because you have chosen blind obedience.</p>
<p>Want to talk more about compassion?  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWwzgGW-ovY">Suicide- the true cost of lockdowns.</a></p>
<p>Children as young as 11 years old have committed suicide because of lockdowns.  CHILDREN!!!  I will sacrifice a thousand people age 90+ for 1 eleven year old child.  I honestly don't believe you would.  I think you'll sacrifice several children for 1 senior citizen.  That's what lockdowns are doing.</p>
<p>You have absolutely no right to attack my compassion.  THAT is why I've been rude to you and will continue to be.</p>
<p><strong>Infection rates</strong></p>
<p>You really believe that the most infections virus in human history only managed to infect 2.5% of the world's population in 20 months after spreading around the entire planet in only 3 months?!  You honestly believe that?</p>
<p>This virus spread to every continent; every country; every state; and every nearly nursing home in 3 months and YOU really believe 100% that it managed that without infecting anyone?   If you add up all of the nursing home deaths and nursing home staff and residents around the world, that's 1% of the world's population right there.</p>
<p>So your honest claim is that this virus that's the most contagious virus in human history spread to 1% of the population (nursing homes around the world) without infecting ANYONE in-between?  THAT is your claim?</p>
<p>And then, to top it off, you think that over a year later, it's only managed to infect another 1.5% of the population?  Really?!  Hell, even influenza can infect billions in a single 3 month season!!!!!</p>
<p>But covid takes over a year to infect 2.5%?!</p>
<p>Don't you get it?!  Your sources are wrong!  You don't believe in science- I DO!!!</p>
<p>No virus can spread across the entire planet without infecting nearly everyone in between!  Not in three months!  If you can't see that, then get the fuck out and go back to your covid sub!  You're not smart enough to understand any of the information we post on this sub.</p>
<p><strong>Lockdowns</strong></p>
<p>"if the scientists say stop lockdown/stop vaccines and the government says continue, you bet your ass ill be hollering as loud as i can about it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvxIXd2-3fo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvxIXd2-3fo</a></p>

<p>There's no compassion in your eyes for people who have been ruined by lockdowns.  You're just lying.  You are ignoring everything being said by doctors who are pleading with governments to stop the lockdowns!  Don't say, "well, I just didn't know" - BULLSHIT!  I knew!!  I found this information.  Why didn't you?!  You didn't because you didn't want to see it.  You didn't want to care.  You WANT covid to continue.  You WANT lives to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Vaccines</strong></p>
<p>There was a study done where they took in the number of people who have been killed by the vaccines.  The study was retraced, not by the authors, but by big Pharma.  The authors released a scathing statement standing by their research.  </p>
<p><a href="https://dailysceptic.org/2021/06/24/one-person-dies-for-every-three-lives-saved-says-peer-reviewed-vaccine-study/">https://dailysceptic.org/2021/06/24/one-person-dies-for-every-three-lives-saved-says-peer-reviewed-vaccine-study/</a></p>
<p>You cannot release studies against big pharma because they are too powerful.  The study proves that the vaccines aren't safe.  I've tried to tell you that, but you don't give a shit.  Every scientist in your mind is WRONG unless they ONLY think like you want them to think.</p>
<p>Go read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Virus-Mania-COVID-19-Hepatitis-Billion-Dollar/dp/3752629789">Virus Mania</a>.  It's the 3rd edition and covers covid-19.  I own a copy.  It's a really good read written by 3 doctors.  Oh, spoiler alert, they don't agree with you.</p>

        <p>i realize now i didnt directly address the study from the septic tank website, and i dont wanna risk you thinking im running away from it.</p>
<p>on septic tank media, they even confirm the vaccine is better than covid. even with the highly-criticized methodology used (self-reporting side-effects with no verification of causal link), they still determined that the vaccine produces less deaths than covid. 3 saved, 2 dead. thats a +1 net gain of a life. so EVEN in your horribly done, horribly reported study criticized widely for many reasons, the proof is in the pudding. even the absolute WORST CASE scenario to be released in a study, it STILL shows that the vaccine is effective at netting us lives-saved.</p>

        <p>you just linked me youtube videos and links to right-wing media websites (one even called <a href="https://christianpost.com">christianpost.com</a> lmao!!), while i linked you peer-reviewed scientific studies, and you claim you believe in science and i dont. <em>fascinating take.</em></p>
<p>im not saying you dont have compassion, just that you have selective compassion. you care about what science says about flu numbers and are compassionate, but when science tells u the same thing abt covid u somehow stop caring. no peer-reviewed articles have been written about ANY of your claims, <strong>hence why you linked a total of 0 scientific studies and all of my claims are backed up with studies.</strong> im sure youre a good person on what youre sure of... youre just allowing your judgment to be clouded by conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>i linked you a peer-reviewed study on death counts in 2020 which shows suicides dropped from '19 to '20, thats science in action <strong>and you discredit it bc it doesnt fit your narrative</strong>. you literally sent me a <em>youtube video</em> done by some random lady to bolster your point and i gave you a scientific journal article... which should we trust? susie who got her GED and a $200 camera from target, or martha who spent 8 years getting her doctorate? even if suicides were tremendously higher, the risk/reward was studied by people who trained for 8 years to study those exact things, and they made the call that a deadly virus would kill more people than those by suicide. where is your education to make a counter claim to them? what empirical data do you have? you have NONE, so you must defer to scientists who objectively know more than you.</p>
<p>your study that you claim was thrown out by big pharma is fact-checked using a website that literally spells skeptic incorrectly in their name, and reads more like septic. thats how i judge the quality of that source- septic. find me any research paper that makes these claims. ill even give in to your insanity and say theyre being suppressed by public journals, so ill accept research papers that ARENT published in scientific journals. bet you still cant find a single scientifically sourced article about your claims. you know how easy it would be for them to upload their study to the internet, right? and if its not on the internet, its likely that it <em>doesnt exist</em> moreso than big pharma somehow permanently deleted something from the internet <em>for the first time in history.</em> please recognize how lenient im being, willing to accept non-published, bootleg studies as long as they are empirical studies done by PhDs, just to give you as much lee-way as i possibly can here. and you still cant produce a study, i guarantee it.</p>
<p>once again, we're to the point where you just flat out dont believe in science. you believe in what you want to CALL "science" but if its not reproducible and peer-reviewed, it does not meet the standards for "empirical data" and falls in the realm of "intuition", like the youtube video you sent me. news articles from known biased sources with political agendas have never been and will continue to not be accepted in the scientific community as proof of anything but your own inability to do research.</p>
<p>i also wont run away from the fact that there are doctors who probably support your side. just gotta look at the numbers though. if 1% say something and 99% say something else, and the 99% have hundreds of studies on what they purport, well shit, im going with the 99%. see how im not running away from your claims like most people would? i admit there are doctors who dont support the mainstream, and ill even take it a step further. dissenting voices in the scientific community are NECESSARY for it to function. if there are dissenting voices and their message gains no traction, then they have no evidence for their claim for it to gain traction. scientists are very passionate about absolute truths, and if there were evidence for a claim, the # who support that claim would inevitably grow. the only way this doesnt happen is if you believe in a world-wide underground cabal of conspirators faking every study for what... world domination? seems silly, to say the least.</p>
<p>also, you flat out denied the results of the studies i sent. i linked a long term, massive scale study of 20,000+ people and you straight said "that didnt happen its a lie", at which point you are effectively saying "the highest standard of the scientific process is not enough for me". at that point, what is enough? if i find something on "<a href="https://ImARepublican.com">ImARepublican.com</a>" or "<a href="https://WhiteChristians.com">WhiteChristians.com</a>" would you then believe me? <strong>why are your sources from journalists with a 4 year degree on creative writing better than my sources from 8 yr degree PhD doctors running multiple studies independently that all verify each other???</strong></p>
<p>your reasoning skills are substantially lacking if you think TFI Global News is unbiased when they literally THEMSELVES tweeted "We proudly wear our bias with a badge of honor, you can read it in our bio. we dont try to appear neutral before questioning someone" <a href="https://twitter.com/FrustIndian/status/1201385536012685313">https://twitter.com/FrustIndian/status/1201385536012685313</a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FrustIndian">https://twitter.com/FrustIndian</a></p>
<p>bio: "right arm, around the world"</p>
<p>a self-admitted, right-wing biased news media named <em>The Frustrated Indian News Media</em> is your gotcha... i should have known that no matter how many hours i dug for proper counters to you, itd never be enough and you can always post some youtube vlog as your counter point. idk how to convince you that you cant disprove a pandemic from your living room, nor can these youtubers or creative writing graduates who work for the media. oh yea, i thought you didnt trust the media? but you do when it confirms your worldview? <em>suspicious...</em></p>
<p><strong>why not trust the people we as a society have deemed the most educated and well-equipped to handle the situation?</strong> isnt that what youd do if you managed a company? put the best minds for certain tasks on said tasks, and if Bob from HR doesnt think our accounting should be done a certain way, we're just gonna ignore him right? because hes not educated on accounting, right? so why when it comes to other things, do you trust HR (random youtubers) to do the work of epidemiologists????? <strong>it blows my mind, and i truly cannot understand your motivations for this.</strong></p>
<p>i took in all of your criticisms and responded to them all, but you still cede NO ground even when confronting direct evidence you are incorrect. you just call anything that doesnt fit in your worldview as fake or a conspiracy by the elites or some shit. that is called <strong>conspiratorial ideation</strong> and studies show that conspiratorial ideation is associated with right-wing mentalities, and, <em>get this,</em> <strong>low levels of intelligence</strong>. science is on my side again, who coulda guessed it. (source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5248629/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5248629/</a>)</p>
<p>if you dont accept scientific studies, there is literally NOTHING more i can say to you to get anywhere. no matter what i say, youll link blogs and vlogs by crazier and crazier people as your evidence, while im  relying on scientific systems that are proven to work- the same scientific methods that runs the internet, your cell phone, your car, etc. i believe in science and the scientific method, you clearly do not, evidenced by your refusal to accept scientific studies and your affinity to accept youtube videos by random people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong></p>
<p>if you cannot cede ground to the scientific community at large and the results of their labors, i truly dont see what else i can say to you. id like to respond to all of your claims, but if i do hours of research to find the perfect studies to rebut your claims and you refuse to accept them, what else am i to do other than walk away? ive dedicated a LOT of diligent time to this convo, and i feel youve just blurted out your emotions at me. im asking this seriously: <strong>what could i possibly produce to give credence to my position?</strong> <strong>what WOULD convince you, hypothetically?</strong></p>

        <p>i was laughing at your sourcing abilities, not the content of the articles. you have to label me as a devil who heartlessly doesnt care about children just so you dont have to confront the overwhelming amount of data i gave you that conflicts with your worldview. im a human, just like you, and i have compassion for the suffering of others. reading my arguments in good faith rather than bad faith, could go a long way in producing more fruitful conversations. we all want a better world, just different notions of how to get there, and it doesnt make either of us evil.</p>

<p>edit: i can restate this differently, just to give you what you want: yes, im a horrible person, etc etc. okay now we're past that. what about all the scientific data i sent? pretend a good person sent you that info when you read it if that makes a difference. my character shouldnt affect the quality of the data- i didnt participate in any of those studies if it makes you feel better about them.</p>

        <p><strong>Blood Clots</strong></p>
<p>You obviously don't read your own sources.  People from your side of the argument NEVER EVER DO!</p>
<p>From that study you linked:</p>
<p>-A  systematic  review  of  cohort studies suggested an  incidence  of  CVT  among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to be about 800 per million patients. </p>
<p>-There was evidence of selection, ascertainment, and reporting bias in all included studies.</p>
<p>-The incidence of CVT and PVT among both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients withCOVID-19 is unknown.</p>
<p>-It is unknown if COVID-19 increases the risk of CVT and PVT. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is the study you want to use as proof that the J&amp;J vaccine is safe?  This study calls itself bullshit!  The TL;DR (applies to you) of this study is- people were diagnosed with covid and had blood clots- therefore covid causes blood clots.</p>
<p>Elderly people have blood clots.  That's a fact.  This study did nothing to determine whether or not this was actually CAUSED by covid.</p>

        <p>The risk of CVT was 8 to 10 times higher in the 513,284 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis than in the 489,871 vaccinees and 100 times greater than in the general population.</p>
<p>-study results directly contradicting your claims</p>
<p>"However, the signals that COVID-19 is linked to CVT, as well as portal vein thrombosis—a clotting disorder of the liver—is clear, and one we should take note of," he said.</p>
<p>-lead author and PhD directly contradicting your claims</p>
<p>"The researchers are not claiming that vaccines do not increase the risk at all compared to the risk in people who have not been vaccinated and have also not had COVID-19—but they say the CVT risk in people who have had COVID-19 is about 100 times the risk in the general population," he said. "I do think this puts things into context."</p>

<p>Add up the 3 columns for Vax (&lt;21 days post 1, &rt;21 days post 1, 2 doses) for deaths and cases and compar it to UnVax.  Granted, breaking out by under 50/over 50 changes the results in favor of Vax.  Including everything (which is how we came to the 2% original death rate) the vax isn't working as well for Delta as it seems like people thought it would.  There are more deaths both by raw number and by proportion.</p>

        <p>That doesn't fully relate to what I posted.  Can you explain yourself how the numbers are taken out of context when they are pulled directly from the files I linked?  That's why I didn't link a blog, when I come here for discussion I generally try and link studies from government sources.</p>
<p>Also, in the article you linked:</p>
<p>&rt;"Referring to table 4 on page 13 of the PHE briefing released on June 25 (here), the blog details the calculations made to reach its conclusion. "</p>
<p>This entire fact check is only referencing Tech Briefing 17.  Tech Brief 19 is a full month later and has updated numbers that match Tech Brief 18 before it.  That's why I included the dates next to the listing of Briefings.</p>
<p>When I said this:</p>
<p>&rt;Why are more people dying from the Delta variant with the vaccine than those without?</p>
<p>You said:</p>
<p>&rt;Because they aren't...</p>
<p>and I provided 3 reports over the course of a month that directly countered that claim.  Also, my question was genuine.  Why were there more deaths?  Older people?  Co morbids?  It's not listed in the study but at the end of the day there have indeed been more Delta deaths in vax vs unvax according to those files.</p>

        <p>Well taking Pfizer as approximately 95% effective, for every 10,000 people, that's still at least 500 possible cases. And the efficacy of the vaccine in the real world with lots of variables is likely a bit different than the control of an experiment.</p>

<p>Well, you thought wrong, perhaps you've been fed misinformation about basic definitions</p>
<p>Let's check some definitions</p>
<p>Vaccine - a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases</p>
<p>Immunity -  a condition of being able to resist a particular disease especially through preventing development of a pathogenic microorganism or by counteracting the effects of its products</p>
<p>So, a vaccine is a substance that  counteracts the effects of a pathogen.</p>
<p>99+% of US covid deaths are unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Sure seems to me like they're effective</p>

        <p>hmm thats weird that it just depends on the website.
this is a fine definition to I just think the one I posted is what people think of then they think vaccine, atleast thats what I think, and get a bit confused about the one for COVID.
whatever it is its pretty genius to make something that pretends to be the virus</p>

Deblasio "the time for voluntarily getting the vaccine is over" Germany, france, Italy, and some other European countries have concentration camps for people with COVID, you have no idea how vaccines work if you think they're supposed to not make you immune.

        <p>Yes.  Especially if they want younger people to take a shot to make up for their own lack of personal health.</p>
<p>Obese people being weak to a virus is a non issue.  Don't be fat.  Simple as.  People had a year and a half to lose weight, knowing it was important.</p>
<p>If the gov really cared about us, they would have forced a workout regiment as well as banned fast food during the pandemic.  Instead, they shut down gyms and private companies are giving you beer, donuts and other garbage to get a vaccine.</p>
<p>This is the part where most say that obesity isn't contagious.  I agree.  However, YOU being more at risk from YOUR decisions is not my problem - especially for a vaccine that doesn't have any long term data.  Forcing people to choose Virus or Vaccine, by stating the Vaccine is better is anti science as there is no long term data to support that.</p>
<p>did you know, not accounting for age mind you, more vaccinated people have died from delta than the unvaccinated?  link for you, page 18.  Add up the Vax deaths over Vax cases and compare it to unvax deaths over unvax cases.  rows are labeled "All Cases".</p>

<li>vaccinated people have started to think as though they are now bullet proof by getting the vaccine</li>
<li>vaccinated are receiving a non-neutralizing vaccine and don't understand what that means, so they go out, can potentially get infected with the same variant they are supposedly protected against, become a breeding ground for mutations, and then become super spreaders for other variants</li>
<li>The unvaccinated who get sick and recover, become seropositive in a neutralizing way and don't have the same problem. On top of that, there is no preferential T-Cell response for just the spike, so it doesn't blow out their cross immunity.</li>

        <p>Look at the Israeli study. There's a supplemental index showing the difference between between the two cohorts after 42 days being a whopping 19 more in the unvaxxed group. </p>
<p>In fact, after 42 days, everything stabilized on both cohorts showing the vaccine was only marginally effective but not in a statistically significant way that far outweighed that of the control group.  Any other drug or vax would have been DOA if these were the results. I am in the trials field.. so I kind of know how that works. </p>

        <p>Did you read this data? Cause if you'd realized that there are graphs breakdown of vaccinated vs unvaccinated numbers. Sever covid symptoms, hospitalizations, and death are drastically greater for those unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Israel is a little over 60% vaccinated. If the vaccine is ineffective there would be more deaths amongst the vaccinate cohort.</p>

<p>Did you look at the risk criteria on pg 36?  36% of the people were obese.  The graphs show (at 100% zoom), statistically NO difference.  They are NOT drastically greater. Not sure how you're getting that from two lines that are practically on top of each other (cumulative incidence at .001 for unvaxed).  Essentially zero.</p>

<p>You can't. They are still cooking the books and reporting combination deaths which has never been done in history, and should never be done. It's falsified information. At this point you can't believe a god damn thing the CDC is saying, they discredited themselves.</p>

        <p>I can compare them for delta.</p>
<p>See my comment below</p>
<p>did you know, not accounting for age mind you, more vaccinated people have died from delta than the unvaccinated? link for you, page 18. Add up the Vax deaths over Vax cases and compare it to unvax deaths over unvax cases. rows are labeled "All Cases".</p>

        <p>Interesting data for the table you directed me, things that I saw:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unvaccinated people made up 52.9% of ER visits for treatment (ending up in the hospital) vs completely vaccinated being 12.5% </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the deaths days after hospitalization, I saw you include the clause of “ignoring age” and now I see why you would say that. When looking at the fully vaccinated, people over 50 made 53.9% of deaths recorded after a positive delta variant test. Compared to the unvaccinated of the same age group, they made up 39.7% of deaths recorded. That’s an interesting stat, I’d like to look into why the data came out like this. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But when we look at folks under 50... 8.88% of the deaths were fully vaccinated while 75.5% of deaths were completely unvaccinated. </p>
<p>I do thank you for providing this source. It doesn’t undermine my decision to get a vaccine, but reaffirms as I’m under 50 and I don’t want to be hospitalized for COVID. So thank you.</p>

<p>True.  However Vax is at 47.1%.  Pretty close to the 1:1 you were talking about before.</p>
<p>&rt;I saw you include the clause of “ignoring age” and now I see why you would say that.</p>
<p>I did that specifically because the breakouts by age are not the same as the sum.  It would have been dishonest to say otherwise.  Like you said, odd way for the data to come out but it does happen.  They did note that the &lt;50 and &rt; 50 may not add up to the whole in a note, however.  Overall though, the point still stands that numerically and proportionally there are more post vax deaths than non vax.  Obviously that's because of older people who would die anyway though - except that line of thinking wasn't allowed a year ago.</p>
<p>&rt;But when we look at folks under 50... 8.88% of the deaths were fully vaccinated while 75.5% of deaths were completely unvaccinated. </p>
<p>34 deaths out of 119,603 is so statistically insignifigant.  So is 10 out of the 60,000.  Point being, Delta really isn't a worry compared to the OG Covid for the under 50 people.  I wish they had the under 40/30 etc. as well as BMI to paint a better picture.</p>
<p>&rt; I do thank you for providing this source. It doesn’t undermine my decision to get a vaccine, but reaffirms as I’m under 50 and I don’t want to be hospitalized for COVID. So thank you.</p>
<p>No problem.  I don't care what decision people make as long as they don't needlessley shame.  Personally, I'm willing to take the 1/3501 odds of death over a vaccine that lacks long term trials and testing.  </p>
<p>Side note (kind of why I replied to you in the beginning)</p>
<p>&rt;So then compare the number of unvaccinated vs vaccinated people dying then. It should be 1:1 which would prove that the vaccine is ineffective. Do you have any data/evidence to show this?</p>
<p>I don't want to say the vaccine is ineffective but it's clearly not as effective as originally thought.</p>

        <p>How are you getting 47%? It’s should be fully vaccinated (2 doses) over total cases.</p>

<p>100% - 52.9 = 47.</p>
<p>Even hospitalization rates among different vax periods don't vary much.  Pretty much around the 3.6% - 3.8 % range.</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/a/UVG5Egv</p>
<p>Quick and dirty in excel, had to manually type in numbers because the chart didn't paste well in Excel and I couldn't find any raw data.  Don't get me wrong, I agree that the vax are going to the hospital less than unvax when accounting for proportion of cases.  However the chance is still small to begin with and doesn't take any comorbities, specific age group or any other factors into play.</p>

        <p>You can’t do 100 - unvaccinated = vaccinated. It’s not a zero sum situation. It’s there are those who were only 1 shot in a 2 shot series which means these weren’t complete protected. You fudged the numbers. Re-run your analysis using completely vaccinated data. </p>
<p>If it wasn’t necessary they would have coupled the data all under vaccinated, but they separated it for a reason. Don’t cheat the data to confirm a theory. That’s bad statistics</p>

<p>I don't think I did.  Look at the screenshot I posted.  Hospitalization and deaths are pretty consistent between 1 shot and 2 shot.  It's actually a fair comparison given the hospitalization rates.  In some cases the one shot people were actually better off than the 2 shot people.</p>
<p>Respectfully, it seems you responded without looking at the screenshot I posted using data from the source.  </p>
<p>And this is honestly arguing over old data anyway, since Briefing 20 was released last friday.</p>
