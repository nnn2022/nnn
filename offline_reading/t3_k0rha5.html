    <strong>Why does your average person put politicians and the people they see on their screens, up on a pedestal?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm thankful that so much of my family has been anti-government for as long as I can remember. When I was 7 my late grandmother told me <em>"Politicians are liars and con-men, never trust any of them."</em> I never forgot that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most other people act like these lying idiots are above us and have the right to tell us how to live our lives. And the politicians and celebrities believe it themselves.</p>
<p>Like what the fuck? You're literally just a person like I'm just a person, why the fuck would I let you tell me what I can and can't do?</p>
<p>Do people <em>enjoy</em> being slaves?</p></p>

        <p>The entire education system is designed to foster deference to authority, obedience and dependence on the system. If anyone steps out of line, the quickly get slapped back into place, put on addictive mind-altering drugs or labelled and written off as a future criminal underclass.</p>
<p>Everyone, including the free-thinkers, are slaves, but most people have been raised to love their chains.</p>

        <p>It's funny, I think I realised early on in my life that just because someone is in charge doesn't mean they're right. Anyone who's ever been ridiculed for a belief, or victimised by an authority figure knows this too I assume. That doesn't mean all authority figures are bad or wrong, no, it means you should never assume they are always right, or are doing things with a good and well thought out purpose.</p>

        <p>Even believers in God can go off the deep end just like the Branch Covidian cult. Ever heard of the Salem Witch Trials or the Crusades? Millions killed for the same reason the Covid bs is being pushed now. Fearmongering. It's best to just believe in yourself and not worship anything. God, radical Islam, science, all of it is the same. A religion people can attach to to justify their atrocities. That's what 2020 proves.</p>

        <p>Everyone in high school loves the captain of the football team, the pretty cheerleader, the president of the class. If you're popular, your opinion means something. What you wear, everyone wants to wear. Where you go, people follow.</p>
<p>Politicians (and other celebrities) are the people who assume that position in adult society.</p>

        <p>The majority of people naturally want to follow. They want to be led to the correct path. The coronavirus has been an extremely difficult time for many people, a lot of this is because the media is leading them to believe all these sensationalized things about how deadly it is. Most people want to absolve themselves of any responsibility and it’s easy for them to convince themselves “oh a doctor or a politician on tv is saying this so it must be true.”</p>

        <p>Most people don't think that way. Most of us agree with your late grandmother. But most of us also think the virus is real, and that masks and distancing are a good idea. Most of us are also sick of the lockdowns, and won't survive if the government doesn't pass more stimulus relief for us.</p>

        <p>I mean we spend like $10 billion a year on biodefense. A lot of it goes to Fauci. I am not really impressed with what we’ve bought for the money. Are you?</p>
<p>Synthetic biology is at the point where several labs can synthesize viruses de novo. Maybe masks and social distancing and money printing aren’t good ideas for low-impact agents? I think we should move on.</p>
