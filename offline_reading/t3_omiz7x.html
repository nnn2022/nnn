    <strong>Questions and worries about the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Well, hello. I (17M) have seen all my family getting vaccinated, really happy and cheerful after being ready to return to the "new normal". I haven't got it yet and I have decided to investigate a bit about the vaccine. When I came across with this subreddit I was scared, obviously. I mean I know I can't take Reddit posts as absolute trues but people telling that every vaccinated person is going to die this fall is scary to say the least. Is there any paper where it states something like this? I am looking for actual papers about secondary effects of the vaccines because most what I have got is just heavy politicized pro-vax media. I want to read what the scientists and not the politicians think about the vaccine. Any recommendations?</p></p>

        <p>My advice is, don't let anyone make your decision for you either way.  Do your own research and make your own decision. It's your life, live it the way you wish.</p>

        <p>Dude, or gal, or whatever the fuck you are, just do your own research. If you can’t find conclusive evidence of whatever it is you’re looking for then maybe do nothing? It’s really that simple. I can’t believe that people want any more information besides the fact that you can’t sue pharmaceutical companies and that this is a fully experimental medical practice. Not FDA approved. What more can someone want besides knowing that you have absolutely no clue what is going to happen to your body or mind once  you take it? No paper is going to let you know what’s going to happen you. Maybe that is because there is no long term safety data done on this EXPERIMENT. Like ffs, common sense exists for a reason. Would you drink water if you stumbled across it in nature and had absolutely no clue what the effects of it could be? Would you go into your front lawn and eat a mushroom that you have not a single clue if it’s going to kill you? Please, how is this any different? Because your mom or dad told you it’s healthy? Because your president or some politician told you this? If the news or a politician or your mom told you that mushroom was healthy, would you eat it? Knowing there’s a chance it could ruin your life?</p>
