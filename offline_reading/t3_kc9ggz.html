        <p>The virus is over for me. </p>
<p>I will have to take more revolutionary action. </p>
<p>I'll have to go to speakeasies and underground events. I'll have to find people planning underground music fests. </p>
<p>I'll <em>have to</em> become the dreaded super spreader lol. </p>
<p>Why? Because I wore the damn mask in the store like you asked for a year. I didnt travel (out of my own desire but also some family refused to host me). </p>
<p>I watched as my boss struggled to make ends meet. Watched as she tried to let her employees have freedom as much as she could without running her business into the ground. </p>
<p>Watched my parents business they worked 15 years for get shut down, all employees let go, and them have zero income for 4 months because their jobs completely shut down and their country had no unemployment. I watched business after business shut down. </p>
<p>I suffered the social isolation in silence and ignored the mild depression setting in. </p>
<p>I haven't heard someone speak clearly at a store in almost a year now. </p>
<p>I see how people lie about where they've been and what they did for the weekend or the holiday because they're terrified to be the next target of a covid crazy. </p>
<p>I watch as people hide their family trips and vacations for fear of retribution.</p>
<p>I myself am scared to keep running my business because I don't require my clients to wear masks and I'm afraid a covid crazy will report me one day </p>
<p>And I am tired. I will not take this virus with me into 2021.</p>

        <p>I can relate to that "I haven't heard someone speak clearly at a store in almost a year now." And its not always the older folks. But at least I can blame that partly on their lack of lungs for the elderly. I came here after the crappy crap fest that was the discussion about the New York Nurse who received the first vaccine. Please God tell me people would rather see a beach or a festival rather than a drugstore full of maskys.</p>

        <p>Haha at least I'm consistent. I'm anti-police - not the "all cops are bad" type, but "all cops are fallible humans who shouldn't have such authority over other humans" type - regardless of my own personal interests. Even if I thought we should all be wearing masks, I wouldn't demand governments and corporations enforce it. I'd simply take precautions of my own free will and encourage my loved ones to do the same.</p>

        <p>Oddly I'm going to defend them because the whole idea that people arrive at political opinions as a result of belief in low-level policies is not true. And consequently anybody who takes any given stance can always be found to be wildly hypocritical in other areas.</p>
<p>For example, in some cases I seem pro-police, but in other cases I am pro-civil-rights, or pro-radical-libertarianism. I support police in arresting criminals, possibly shooting them if they violently resist arrest. Leftists would call me a hypocrite for wanting to resist lockdown/quarantine orders. You have to go higher up the chain of values in order to find the unifying abstract principle that explains all the opinions that seem contradictory at lower levels.</p>
<p>Roughly approximated (because the higher you go, the harder it is to articulate), my unifying value is that I seek an orderly, lawful, culturally and ethnically homogenous society that tolerates no overt criminality (theft, assault, etc), but that also places the civil liberties of otherwise law-abiding citizens above most other things. <strong>But</strong> I also strongly seek HARMONY so I don't believe that one person's civil liberties should be allowed to be wildly, destructively out of line with the society around them. So for example I would not support transgressive 'art' that seeks only to shock and disrupt, like somebody covering themselves in menstrual blood in a performance art piece.</p>
<p>Really people should just stop pretending to care about singular principles ("I support the police!"), because they are never the whole story and you always end up getting tied in hypocritical knots when extending the principle to novel scenarios. It would be easier to sort of paint a coherent, holographic picture of the ideal society you have in mind. (For me, it would be something like: 1950s Switzerland)</p>
<p>IMO the clearest reason for the long march of societies to the grave, is a short-sighted reliance on an ever-growing body of individual laws, instead of working with a 'societal gestalt' that would inform every individual decision, every individual case. Instead we have people who are trained at great expense in order to navigate a maze of weaponized legalese, attempting to twist and contort individual laws to suit whatever outcome they have in mind. This does not lead to a happy, harmonious society - only degradation and entropy over enough time.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, I actually don't have a problem with leftists calling police to enforce their worldview <em>per se</em>. I just think the world they are trying to create by such actions is actually a <em>monstrous, destructive, satanic thing</em>. And if our civilization hadn't gone all in on our current legal system, we could potentially have created something better that would have led to a much more happy, much more harmonious society.</p>

        <p>You’re not getting what I’m saying. Of course no one has been arrested. But if you say you hate police or you want police defunded or gotten rid of, you have absolutely no business calling them if you need help. Fuck you, figure it out yourself. I’m saying I find it hypocritical that these people who don’t want the police are the first ones to call the police and snitch out their neighbors. Obviously it went over your head</p>

        <p>Honestly this is my favorite reddit subgroup because I am reminded that I am not the only sane one. I don't understand how so many people are okay with the majority of people saying the same things. I feel like I was dropped into a really bad simulation and most people's critical thinking skills and awareness have been taken away, but I'm burdened with knowing that much of the information that's being repeated is bs. I'm just glad to know I'm not alone. My roommate very much believes the numbers and the masks and that Biden will rescue us all. I honestly believe something will happen to him and Kamala will take over and that was the plan behind the scenes all along. I'm not saying Trump is great; he says some really dumb shit, BUT I appreciate that he isn't controlled by anyone. At least that's the way I see it. I hate wearing a mask. I notice that I sneeze more now than I ever used to. My nanny girls keep developing coughs and I'm pretty sure it's related to wearing a mask all day. When I pick them up from school, I don't wear a mask. I stand outside the building until they walk out (that's protocol). I'm outside and I'm not standing close to anyone else. Everyone is so afraid of everyone else and we can't see anyone's facial expressions anymore. I don't wear a mask when I'm at my nanny family's house and we hug and are close. I think it's absolutely ridiculous when someone is wearing a mask outside. Also, has anyone noticed that the signs in front of stores state that someone can't enter without a mask? But there is no wording that says the mask must be worn at all times in store?</p>

        <p>They have moved the goalposts again.  Professor Jon Klein of the University of Louisville now says that even herd immunity is not enough to remove the masks.  He says that they should be required for months or even years even after herd immunity.  Basically, let's go until Covid reaches zero.  Something is wrong, very wrong.  These people are evil.</p>

        <p>I’m reaching my breaking point where I feel I can’t be silent to avoid conflict anymore. I’ve given this virus almost a YEAR after being told two weeks, my governor (va) is locking down harder, and I just feel as if I’m living in an alternate reality. Do you guys ever look back to February and remember how normal it was? Back then I was commuting to DC on a crowded metro every day. I ended up getting a job closer to home and between starting that job and quitting the DC one, I took a two week at home vacation. Fast forward two weeks, and I am told on my first day to go home and work there for two weeks. I still barely know my coworkers. I’m also approaching them for the yearly evaluations and I just feel like I would have been so much more up to speed if I could have been in a physical office. I actually like being in an office for the structure, collaboration, and quiet workspace. Ugh.</p>
<p>My fitness class (OTF) is my favorite way to relieve stress. And now, all of them in the northern VA area have decided to comply with the governors edicts (basically fitness classes have different rules than big gyms because SCIENCE) by literally giving us a piece of paper and having us direct our own workout. The coach is there for “corrections” but to be honest I have my doubts. They won’t reduce the price for reducing services to essentially what I can do at a much cheaper full gym. I kind of lost it over this because it feels like VA is headed towards full lockdown and more things like this class will become a shell of what they once were.</p>
<p>My other issue going on is that I’m almost 30. I’m married and I want kids. But I wanted to wait until we had a chance to take a few trips and have certain experiences before doing so, and nothing seems to be reopening. If we just decided to have kids now instead, what would that even be like? They wouldn’t have the same childhood experiences and I just don’t don’t know.</p>
<p>I realize this post is kind of a word dump of my feelings but just..I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I work everyday for nothing other than to exist and pay my mortgage.</p>

        <p>It’s always crazy to me when I look at the date and it’s Halloween/middle of November/half way through December. This year has completely blended together into one. Someone could name a major event that happened and i couldn’t tell you what month it happened in.</p>
<p>Right now the thing that gives me hope is strength in numbers. I know we’re the minority right now, but every day more and more people are realizing just how fucked up everything is. Twitter and Reddit and our local TV don’t show the full picture and it’s easy to get sucked into the “oh god everyone is against me” mentality.  </p>
<p>I feel you on the wanting to go out and do fun things. Everything in my area is closed so all my date nights have turned into “Netflix and getting drunk” nights.</p>
<p>It’s hard right now, but know your actions right now can help influence the world you want to raise a kid into. Posting on subreddits like this, talking to friends and family, spreading this message helps not only you feel better, but may change the minds of people who actively make this world a living hell. Some days it’s hard to live for yourself but try thinking about creating a better world for your future kid.</p>
<p>My response is also a bit of a word dump but sometimes it’s hard to put a coherent thought together when there’s so much bullshit going on. I hope you’re doing alright and I hope you get to experience everything you were planning.</p>

        <p>One question- realistically what would protesting even accomplish?</p>
<p>They would just demonize you in the media.</p>
<p>I just speak up when I can, I don’t pretend to accommodate doomers, and I’m a fan of malicious compliance.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, it's your life and your choice. Obviously. But personally, I highly recommend you maybe wait a little bit longer to have kids. That said, I never have and never will want children of my own, so perhaps I'm a bit biased. But I just think it would be in the best interest for everyone involved - you, your spouse, and any eventual tots - to make certain your life is safe and secure as humanly possible. Especially considering how pregnant women are being treated in hospitals these days, being denied support from their loved ones, and the rushed experimental COVID vaccine that even the most hardcore pro-vaxxers are skeptical about. The issues we face today, the restrictions and mandates around the world? They began long before COVID. And they probably won't end with COVID either.</p>

        <p>I am so done.
Over here in Germany the 2nd lockdown starts on the 16th. Everything closes again, Christmas is basically cancelled. Only 5(!) Persons allowed, Germans on Reddit and politicians are already screaming for that to be controlled as in they want the police to go from door to door and check if there really are just 5 or less persons at your own private Christmas party. This shit is 1933 all over again and people still comply. Really makes me want to cry.. it's like we haven't learned anything. Wouldn't even surprise me if they postpone next year's election cuz of the fucking flu. I really hope more people wake up and realise what's being done to us</p>

        <p>That's patently untrue. We are bit under half way to Spanish flu deaths.</p>
<p>I think you're right in that people are scared and behaving a bit irrationally,  but a mask isn't much different then pulling a scarf up, and if it helps some people feel better and be a tiny bit safer, who are you to shit on what gives them comfort?  Hate to ask how you feel about churches if that's the case.</p>

        <p>Good! Do it, do it, do it! </p>
<p>This actually happened to me almost in reverse. I was talking to a guy who was wearing a mask. Obviously I wasn't wearing one. He asked me a question and couldn't understand/hear my answer. A few times he asked me to repeat myself, he still couldn't hear me, and he ended up taking off his mask (so as to hear me better?!). Doomer logic!</p>

        <p>People act like this year is some kind of aberration. No, things are not going to magically go back to what they were before March 2020 come January 1, 2021. They can only get worse. New strains of "deadlier" covid aka more tyrannical measures, more loss of freedoms with coerced testing to travel or return to work, more vaccine passports rolled out, more mass unrest, supply chain shortages, etc. If you haven't thought about organizing yet, you definitely need to soon.</p>

        <p>I'm hopeful though that for some people the new year may be a line in the sand, especially come spring. There's no logical reason why that SHOULD be the case but it really feels as though once 2021 rolls around people will start getting angry.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about how we don't even have visible emotions anymore. The masks have taken that away too. Standing in line at a store is almost comedic in how awkward it can be. Like NPC's lined up. No expression, no emotion, nothing.</p>

        <p>I am so annoyed right now. A friend of mine who I haven’t really spoken to saw that I went to the grocery store to buy some frivolous shit. (Like candy etc bc we were having family movie night) He sent me this weird message that “YOU DO KNOW IT’S COVID, RIGHT? YOU’LL GET SICK IF YOU GO OUT. IT’S NOT ALLOWED AND YOU WILL BE FINED. I WONT CALL THE COPS BUT SOMEONE MIGHT.” I legit was so pissed because of how condescending the tone was. I told him no, it’s a grocery store and I don’t care regardless. Then we moved past it bc he knows my stance on lockdowns and I wasn’t in the mood to have that sort of conversation. He’s a good friend but god if he does it again I am telling him to get fucked. Usually I am polite and appreciate the concern but I find that very rude.</p>

        <p>I'm sick of that meme of someone snorting coke pointing out the irony that said person is worried about what's in the vaccine. It's just trying to dismiss and discredit anyone with legitimate concerns. I've never touched drugs, alcohol or cigarettes in my life. I eat fruits and veggies every day, I'm thin and fit, I take my meds and follow the doctor's instructions to the letter...has it never occurred to them that a health-conscious person such as myself might have some reason to refuse the vaccine? I haven't just gone completely mad. I'm not some loony crackhead.</p>

Regardless of whether it be alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, THC, prescription medication, another person's body part, whatever happens to be in a given vaccine, or whatever else. Your body, your choice. Personally, I'd probably rather snort coke than take the vast majority of whatever pills a doctor may prescribe, but that's my choice. And it should be your choice to refuse a vaccine or any other medical treatment regardless of whether you're a crackhead or a health nut.</p>

        <p>Escaped to beautiful costa rica this week, but am disappointed to find that masks are required almost everywhere. I even wore one outside most of yesterday and it's hot. Doesn't make any sense since we can take them off when we eat or drink, so at that point it shouldn't make a difference anymore. The fact that people can't see that obvious hole in the logic is so discouraging and I can't see an end to it anywhere. I also don't speak Spanish and having to communicate without facial expressions in another language is that much harder. </p>
<p>I love to travel but sometimes I wish there was some kind of anti mask leper colony type society I could join where no one would bother me.</p>

<p>On the other hand it's obvious that the 3rd world countries will subject to all this nonsense the fastest, I thought this will never happen here in the USA but I guess we have adopted the fear mongering mentality instead of logic/common sense</p>

        <p>Update: it has gotten better. I'm with a tour company and its their first tour after covid hit, so they're under a lot of pressure to keep up appearances. Most of the masking is requested/mandated by the company, not the government. And even the company has gotten more lax over the past couple days. Have not worn a mask outside since the original post here, so all is not as bad as it seemed. Would still encourage people to come here and enjoy, it really is a lovely place.</p>

        <p>I've noticed that talking with the mouth closed, mumbling and wearing a mask are the norm nowadays. Yes, wearing a mask are mandatory. But talking with the mouth closed aren't. People are so afraid of spreading the virus and spit coming out of their mouths. Not everyone wants to touch pen and paper either. They could at least learn some sign language, so would the unintelligible speech problem be solved. Everyone should learn to sign. Especially if people are pushing for the new normal.</p>
<p>But we can't say we're back to normal before all the restrictions and lockdown are over.</p>

        <p>I think this mumbling socially awkward nerd thing has been around for a long time but only just become obvious. The "fear of public speaking" or "stage fright" has morphed into something much worse, now every single conversation triggers this. I think it's because this generation grew up protected from so many things, they didn't get a chance to step outside their comfort zone. And I'm not saying this as some grumpy boomer, I'm a young person who used to be extremely shy as a toddler but grew up into a confident public speaker. Kids need to be pushed into social situations so they can learn these skills. The internet trend normalising/glorifying "social anxiety" is not helping anybody.</p>

        <p>Yes, because all the highly extraverted middle-aged maskers I know are so socially anxious. Maybe it's just my town, but I don't know a single young person or shy person who wears a mask without threat of force. Every masker here is a hypersocial collectivist in their 40s to 60s who wears a mask for social status or some shit.</p>

        <p>What an absolute trip it is that now people are seeking new places to live based on mask use and regulations. I don't blame them one bit (If my state keeps this up I am out). But imagine explaining this to someone last year at this time. "Hey, why'd you leave New Jersey?". "Eh, they had a really strict mask mandate".  </p>

Work to support the government/corporate overreach symptomatic of the cancer that is authoritarian collectivism. Hell, she probably won't even make enough money to offset the cost of transportation.

        <p>Saying elderly/infirm[ed] people negates the fact that, while many who died were old, many who died also were healthy and young as well. However, the most important part is that these deaths were preventable by relatively easy and planned measures, which major governmental leadership ignored. That’s the tragedy here.</p>
<p>Think about this: had the WTC towers been filled with people only over the age of 60, would 9/11 be better? Do their lives not matter as much?</p>

        <p>Many of those "healthy" people had unreported underlying conditions, were bodybuilders or marathon runners who pushed their bodies too hard, or were obese like my mother-in-law who is "healthy" according to her medical records despite a MRSA-infected chronic abdominal wall abscess.</p>
<p>And going by years of life lost, 9/11 would indeed be less tragic if the victims were older. Going by quality of death - which is arguably subjective - dying in bed with morphine available to lessen pain and air hunger is less tragic than being crushed in rubble or burned to death.</p>

        <p>Question... </p>
<p>why do doomers believe they are incapable of spreading the virus? </p>
<p>Does doomerism give you some sort of superpower that prevents you from spreading cover? </p>
<p>Or do they believe masks are 100% effective? </p>
<p>I can see the doomer logic in saying not wearing a mask means you're more likely to spread but I can't see the logic in how being a Covid antimask/lockdown thought criminal sudden means you're spreading covid. </p>
<p>How can I spread covid if I don't have covid? </p>
<p>Or does my status as a thought criminal mean my body naturally produces the covid lll</p>
<p>If a doomer and an anti doomer walk into a grocery store and both are wearing a mask... </p>
<p>does only the anti doomer spread it</p>

        <p>&rt; How can i spread covid if i dont have COVID</p>
<p>The disease is asymptomatic in all fairness.</p>
<p>However, seeing as how masks do not 100% stop transmission, that means doomers are spreaders too.</p>
<p>The virus spreads. Thats how a pandemic works</p>

        <p>Because hitting the brakes before you hit the car in front makes the crash less bad.</p>
<p>Noone is saying masks are 100% effective, but not wearing one is 0% effective</p>
<p>If all people were doing was thinking and thoughtfully discussing anti-mask POVs the vast majority of people would not have a problem with it. What people have a problem with is the whiners who refuse to at least try and help. To do their bit to try and help.</p>
<p>&rt;How can I spread covid if I don't have covid?</p>
<p>You can be an asymptomatic carrier and not know you have covid. If you actually don't have it then you can't of course, but unless you have a constant and near unlimited testing resource you cannot know this for sure.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way, if knew you weren't going to be in a car accident you wouldn't need a seatbelt. But you don't know for sure so you wear one as a precaution.</p>
<p>It's not just about saving lives, it's also :</p>
<p>stopping hospitals from getting overwhelmed</p>
<p>having time to make sure enough PPE and medicine is available to treat those affected</p>
<p>Buying time to develop a vaccine, which (unlike the flu) we don't already have</p>
<p>Preventing the risks of long term covid effects</p>

        <p>You're wrong about Covidian logic though. </p>
<p>covid crazies come at me and say <em>you're</em> spreading the disease they always exclude themselves. That's my issue with them. </p>
<p>They believe them going to the grocery store and wearing a mask is 100% effective against covid and that they are not responsible for spreading covid but everyone else is. </p>
<p>Do you see how that makes no sense? </p>
<p>if you're going to work and going outside into the world you can become a covid spreader. </p>
<p>your personal beliefs about masks and the virus don't make a difference if we are both wearing a mask at work and at the store. </p>
<p>you arguing for asymptomatic spread only makes my argument stronger. </p>
<p>a covidian can spread covid at the grocery store just as easily as a lockdown skeptic because asymptomatic people don't tend to stay home. </p>
<p>Covidian logic tells them that when they go to the store or to work it is fine but if I do it, I'm spreading covid. It's stupid.</p>

        <p>But by not wearing a mask you increase the risk (however low it could be). Everyone  can spread it if they have it, so everyone needs to do their part. </p>
<p>If we're all in a rowboat going along and you see someone else not rowing you will blame them if you think you're not going fast enough. This is where that anger comes from. And when they try and argue that we weren't going that fast anyways so it doesn't matter, that just gets you angrier. By not rowing they are saying that they feel entitled to just sit there. </p>
<p>It's the not trying that is upsetting people. The not caring. Thinking that you don't have to row.</p>
<p>Because we're all sick of this. We all just want to go back to normal. Lockdown sucks. Masks suck. But we're so nearly there... So please just row</p>

        <p>who said I don't wear a mask is the question? </p>
<p>Covid crazies always make this assumption. If they took time to read the sub instead of making assumptions they'd see the majority of our posters wear masks and haven't seen friends or family (yeah that's mostly because their friends and family refused but still). We have our fringe people but the only thing most of us are guilty of is thought crime. </p>
<p>I've had more death wished upon me in the past month than in the entirety of my life and <em>I wear the stupid mask</em>. </p>
<p>And this is why I call them Branch Covidians. It is a cult of the unthinking. </p>
<p>Are you 24/7 quarantined?</p>
<p>If not <em>you are rowing the same motherfucking boat</em>. </p>
<p>yes, believe it or not you ordering food, going to the store, going outdoors, gathering with friends even if you're 6 feet apart... those are all methods by which covid is being spread. </p>
<p>Covidians don't care about anyone but themselves anyway. That's how they justify themselves going to the store but still crying about covid spreaders. You don't get to do the bare minimum (wearing masks and avoiding travels and gatherings) and claim your status as a covid saint. </p>
<p>I've said this before but unless you've isolated yourself away from society you cannot say shit to me about anything.</p>

<p>You can complain about people breaking the rules, not wearing masks, and about the situation in general, but complaining about people attempting to continue living their life within the rules isn't right.</p>

        <p>Not true, there's much research to suggest that you become infectious before you actually show symptoms and even if you don't present with symptoms you can still spread it, just to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>Think about it, if only people with symptoms could spread it, then they should be the only people isolating. And it would be very easy to tell you were sick and so you would infect very few/no other people. It makes sense for a virus to make you infection before you get sick because IT WANTS TO SPREAD. It's a virus. That's literally what it does.</p>

        <p>the thing i like to say is...if they're going to make masks mandatory, at least wear a mask that spreads a message eg. "im not a sheep I just need groceries!" or "worn by force, not fear". theres a bunch of great designs online! I wear one that i got from the infowars store. the mask says "<a href="https://infowars.com">infowars.com</a>". youll likely meet like minded people more than if you wear a neutral mask.</p>

        <p>Husband and I can't afford any legal trouble, nor do we have any desire to be banned from every store in town. We went without masks for most of this year, but after Walmart's new "tacticool" security chased us through the store demanding we mask up, we've decided to pick our battles more wisely. Besides, I look like the serial killer they say we are when I smile.</p>

        <p>Sounds like your biggest problem is shopping at Walmart, I do not spend any of my money where my freedoms are under attack. I choose only small businesses and make sure to boycott all corporations; I've deleted all social media (besides reddit) and cancelled all memberships (amazon, pandora and more). That's the only way to have some leverage over the system. Last, fuck the SYSTEM</p>

        <p>My area has few other places to shop besides Walmart and other corporations. Most local small business have been shut down and boarded up since long before I was old enough to vote with my wallet. Can't afford gas to drive several towns over or shipping costs to order online in support of non-local small businesses when the needs of my family here and now are top priority. Corporations are unfortunately cheaper and more convenient for the average lower-class individual.</p>

        <p>I thought my wisdom teeth were causing me problems, but it's actually severe teeth grinding caused by stress. The dentist said she used to see 1 grinding patient per month, but since lockdowns, she's been seeing 5 per week. I cannot believe the intense pain I'm in is caused by nothing other than stress from these completely avoidable, backwards lockdowns. And now I have to spend £263 that I don't have (due to financial problems caused by, wait for it, lockdowns!) to fix it.</p>

        <p>My teeth-grinding problem has been worse lately too. I don't grind my teeth while asleep like some people do, but while awake. Just this persistent low-key jaw-clenching and teeth-grinding from constantly holding back seething rage. Biting my tongue instead kinda helps, as does finding something else to do with my mouth like singing or maybe just talking to myself.</p>

        <p>I'm angry.  I keep getting angrier and angrier.  Usually I can keep it at bay with all my logic and reasoning.  (If you know why someone is doing something, usually it doesn't bother you as much.)  But the more people I see who are unwilling to think or explain their opinions, or reason with anyone, the more hopeless I feel.  </p>
<p>I have worked so hard to overcome horrible ptsd related issues while managing my bipolar disorder and running a household responsibly.  But I am only ever just barely skating through. It's a balancing act and too much stress can essentially make or break me.  That breaking point is something that I have had to carefully cultivate my life around.  </p>
<p>I have pruned such a precise and controlled tree because if I break, who knows how long until I am properly able to function again.  I have had to remove parts of myself to achieve this level of almost normalcy and my kids deserve it. They need me, I'm all they have.</p>
<p>But I feel it slipping.  I have been healthy so much longer than I expected through all of this and I am so thankful.  I don't have the means to move anywhere better and I don't want to live like this.  This isn't life and there is no excuse anymore.  </p>
<p>They can't keep ruining people's lives when the means to help them is a far easier and more straightforward.  </p>
<p>This doesn't have to be the grand sacrifice.  I can't stand for this when small and so very do-able changes could end all the fear and the hate and the harm.</p>
<p>I am kind and loving, my go to instinct is to be helpful and honest.  But my life is not a joke and it's not a bargaining chip.  It's not yours to gamble with.  If it's too risky for me to do then it sure as fuck isn't your say anymore.</p>
<p>Other people can't tell me my risks are worth less, or that I owe them my suffering.  If I could help them I would.  But I won't do something symbolically just so they feel like something is helping. </p>
<p>I won't pretend for you.</p>

        <p>My job is sending out surveys to get everyone's thoughts on returning to work. There are a ton of doomers at my job so most people are not wanting to even think about returning to the office until 2022 🙄🙄🙄. </p>
<p>I think it's going to be very hard for companies to get people back in the office. They are wasting money keeping offices open if no one wants to return. I highly doubt that I will ever go back to the office full time for a very long time, if at all. My company was extremely "you need to be in the office" and I'm wondering when they are going to give up on sending people surveys and just close up the office. </p>
<p>I'm with you though. I think people need to be back in offices again in order to get the economy back. And it's hard to separate work from home. With that said - extra time with kids (if you have them), and no commute are positives of staying WFH. And the added pressure from the doomers that they "don't feel safe" to come back to the office..</p>

        <p>I agree. And it sucks for those businesses who depended on those bustling downtown days. This is all a ripple effect. But as long as the doomers can stay home until they feel "safe" (aka - not have to get dressed and get to watch Netflix during Zoom calls), then it is worth it apparently.</p>

        <p>The other day my aunt suggested I stopped taking the bus to avoid chances of getting the virus.</p>
<p>She said instead I should use my bike.</p>
<p>I live in one of the biggest cities of Mexico, where traffic is crazy, and have to literally cross the entire city to get to work.</p>
<p>Looks like getting the virus is way deadlier than getting hit by a car.</p>

        <p>That's ridiculous! I don't know why everyone is suddenly crazy about bikes...people around here are trying extremely hard to push for cycling to work. This is Australia, for at least 50% of the year it is so hot outside that anyone cycling for more than a few minutes will get fried to a crisp. And in general, bikes are impractical - safety concerns on the highway or out at night or live in a dangerous area, hard to carry things with you, dangerous during bad weather, physically demanding if you're going a long way or have any medical problems.</p>

        <p>Like....I'm all about people cycling and walking more. I can't drive, so unless I want to rely on my husband for all transportation aside from the two-shoe express, I'd like a new bike and/or to fix up my old bike. Then maybe I could make some extra money running errands and making deliveries during those windows in which I don't need to elder-sit my mother-in-law. But for all the reasons you mention, a bike isn't practical for everyone. Very few things are practical for everyone. That one-size-fits-all mindset is one of the biggest problems in our current society.</p>

        <p>Haha sometimes people don't even realize how ridiculous they sound, what I replied my aunt was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I won't, I could get overthrown of my bike by a car </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes but you would only fall and if you catch the virus who knows how would you get</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And I was astonished, I only replied "No hahaha, lots of people die from getting hit by a car and the virus is harmless to the vast majority" and then she realized it was true.</p>

        <p>I live in a small town of 10k people and now that it's cold I keep on seeing people walking around alone on the street with a mask usually middle-aged people. I just don't understand do these people actually think these masks do anything to "block" the virus the only thing they do is protect you against sneezes and coughs and barely at that.</p>
<p>Is it simply them all being indoctrinated into complying I don't know there is nothing in the Bylaw that dictates you have to wear them outside so these people are not being forced to do this.</p>
<p>So in conclusion I don't know if it is a lack of critical thinking skills and they just think mask = protected</p>
<p>Or if it is more of a conformist behaviour, I even had a guy make a motion to his mask when I was walking back from a grocery store maskless(wore on to go inside because of door guards)</p>
<p>Like they obviously think it actually does something for asymptotic cases which is not the case why else do we have trolls come in here and say "you could be asymptotic" when talking about masks its pure ignorance because the mask would not change the infection probability anyways in that situation...</p>
<p>In the summer I saw many people walking around without them, Now I get a dirty look if I don't have one on in public it's not everyone I see a lot of young women and men not complying which warms my heart its also nice to be able to see the faces of the girls I think are pretty, kinda sucks not being able to actually smile at someone you find attractive and get a smile back!</p>
<p>Anyways I try not to let it get to me but, but next time someone is staring daggers at me I'm just gonna go twice at hard and stare at them maybe curl my upper lip I'm a pretty small guy that why everyone's judging me with their eyes so many people I know and have read say if you are tall and big people don't even hassle you for a mask...</p>
<p>Makes sense, they pick on the weaker people...</p>
<p>Personally, my fuse is about to break in a couple of bad encounters away form saying fuck it and going maskless everywhere and printing out a copy of the Halton Hills bylaw and showing them how I am exempt and how I don't have to prove it and them even asking can be considered discrimination</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jyac62/halton_hillsontario_canada_mask_bylaw_exemptions/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jyac62/halton_hillsontario_canada_mask_bylaw_exemptions/</a></p>
<p>I could do this print out the bylaw Get some highlighters etc, but I would still have to explain it to everyone, I would get more judgment compared to just ignoring it</p>
<p>But I still wanna do it, I think the best place to do it would be a government-run store like an LCBO or a beer store I don't wanna alienate one of the restaurants in my small town...</p>
<p>I'm sick of the goddam mental warfare going on</p>
<p>COmply under the fear of monetary punishment(gathering and mask fines)</p>
<p>Comply under the fear of jail time(like that Indian guy no mask 12 hrs detain)</p>
<p>And finally, the one that gets everyone to comply under the fear of being judges by your fellow man......</p>
<p>That's the worse one, if people did not judge others for not wearing masks the bylaws would not matter!</p>
<p>But I live in a Nanny province simple as that, I fucking hate it, It has its redeeming qualities but it would be better if they did not Nanny the people but Canada is a special case it's not just Ontario that is a Nanny province....</p>
<p>Canada is more like a Nanny nation!! But Ontario is probably the worst...</p>

<p>How can you even tell if someone is attractive without a mask? I know I sure can't, I always assume there's something ugly underneath until proven otherwise.</p>

        <p>My mother-in-law - skeptical of the COVID restrictions/mandates until she watches the news and it's like a switch is flipped in her brain - felt the need to shout across the house "a security guard at the White House lost an arm and a leg from COVID" first thing this morning. And my husband scolds me for always talking about COVID, but 99% of the time, his mother or the talking heads on TV started it. I understand though, he simply has more practice ignoring his mother and doesn't notice 99% of the shit she says or does until I point out. Wish I could just ignore people like that. Unfortunately, being hyper-aware of my environment is a habit I developed very early on in life because my own mother is too dangerous to ignore.</p>
<p>And I'm sick of people assuming anti-lockdowners are all far-right/alt-right straight white male Trumpers in their 50s who oppose abortion and gay marriage. I am white, but I'm a bi women in my 20s, and I'm more-or-less lib-center, leaning pretty far left on some issues. Nevermind that left vs right is a false dichotomy to keep us plebs from realizing our true ideals as individuals, families, and local communities. I support medical freedom and bodily autonomy across the board, regardless of my personal feelings on a given medication or procedure. I believe marriage should be defined and ordained by local communities of shared interest. I don't see Fox News as any better than CBS or CNN, and I didn't even know about OAN or whatever it is until I'd been accused multiple times of watching it. I sure as hell don't trust Trump any more than Biden in light of Operation Warp Speed and the national emergency declaration. Of course when I mention I'm a married women, I must be brainwashed by my husband. If anything, I brainwashed him to be so staunchly anti-authoritarian, because he previously didn't care either way so long as life is comfortable and fun. Hell no, my husband didn't put me up to this. He would rather me go offline and mind my own business instead of getting all riled up.</p>
<p>Not everyone on this sub supports Trump and not everyone on this sub is American. Not every woman is brainwashed by her husband, or even married, or even attracted to men. Not everyone who opposes business shutdowns, stay-at-home orders, mask mandates, or mandatory vaccination is far-right or alt-right. Not everyone who opposes mandatory vaccination or is skeptical of the COVID vaccine opposes vaccination in general. The economy isn't just rich folks' yacht money, and not everyone concerned about the economy is some greedy robber baron. Right vs left is a false dichotomy. Corporate vs government is a false dichotomy. To blame this on China only shifts blame away from other world leaders, and to blame this on devils or demons only shifts blame away from the human capacity for darkness.</p>

        <p>I hope it goes okay for you, too. Honestly I am just depressed about everything, I am living very socially isolated and I don’t really see the point in life. I was feeling pretty bad even before the lockdowns, though.</p>

        <p>Never going to Trader Joe's again. I will admit I am a bit of a coward and wear the mask a little over my mouth as it was just a quick trip, didn't have time to be harassed. And then...</p>
<p>I go there with my gf and immediately a dweeb tells me to put the mask over my nose. I keep walking. My gf said people were staring at us, partly bc we stand out and partly bc of the mask thing. Then ANOTHER guy tells me to put the mask up. My gf is furious bc she knows he is only picking on me bc he is like what like 2 inches taller than me, and all these losers get a little power burst from this, even though they never pick on someone their own size or bigger, especially if it's a man. We indeed saw other people with their noses exposed.</p>
<p>I say "I can't breath with it." Immediately he is flustered and repeats some formal response about their policy. I respond "what is the law, can you deny me service?" Honestly trying to rough him up so he doesn't bother another person like me. He says he can't and some BS about it being a small space and being considerate. He was definitely polite although again, I was definitely a target for many reasons. But I politely dismissed him.</p>
<p>I am masculine looking and usually don't get bothered, but with my gf and these people being of the side of "love and tolerance" they love to single us out I swear. Anyone else experience "love and tolerance" for being different, or just in general? Seriously don't go to Trader Joe's. Their employees are trained by Corporate Social Justice (TM). Any regular super market leaves me alone bc their employees have a life and job to focus on.</p>

        <p>My husband is often targeted more because he's a tad shorter than average and he has that scruffy long-haired hippie/redneck/rocker look. I'm rarely targeted directly because I'm an artsy nerdy preteen-looking woman with more legal protections by the good grace of having two x-chromosomes, but it seems any anger toward me gets taken out on my husband instead.</p>

<p>"Hopefully it will be negative" "Oh yes you'll see it was just a false alarm" "🙏"</p>
<p>And I'm like, wtf? Who cares if it comes positive? The only thing that cares is that you feel ok! That you're not getting a bad case of COVID! </p>

        <p>I posted this in LockdownSkepticism, as a post, but jerk mod (sorry, but honestly...) removed it before it would post, so yeah:</p>
<p>Hi fellow skeptics!</p>
<p>I live in Australia, and at the moment, due to dumb shit pertaining to border closures, and my own silly mistakes, I am trapped staying with my... Let's just say toxic parents, in a state where I don't normally live.</p>
<p>My mental health state is less than ideal. It was already rocky before the pandemos, and it has gotten increasingly bad, as things have stacked up against me, as the virus has progressed, over the last few months.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm one of the lucky ones. I know this. I'm not sick. I can see my family (as utterly, utterly shit as that may be, in my case), for the most part, even if I'm about 1600km away from most of my friends. But anyway...</p>
<p>One major thing that irks me, right now, is that my parents insist on having the news on, talking about the pandemic, literally all the time. Every single day, for multiple hours, on multiple channels. Know what I notice? The panic. The fearmongering. The dread and terror that the media (here, at least) seems determined to lord over us all.</p>
<p>There's been another (honestly very small) outbreak in part of Sydney, and of course all the politicians here are rubbing their hands together with glee at the opportunity that provides to lock the area down, close borders and potentially cancel events. They are so unbelievably smug about it all that I honestly don't want to watch anymore...</p>
<p>Our media, and politicians, thrive of this shit. It seems to be just about their lifeblood, this year (all of them, but particularly ABC, Seven and SBS seem to be the worst), and I'm just so... Sick of hearing everyday, about how things are "going to get worse", and "just wait until Country X goes into lockdown again", or "look at how irresponsible they all are!"</p>
<p>The latest thing is to talk about unproven "long covid" effects in the UK... Our media is all over that (particularly SBS), and are slamming it in our faces everyday, now...</p>
<p>It's just all so tiring, and overwhelming, and I wish I currently lived in a situation where I could just shut it all off, for a bit, and try to get on with my life... But sadly, not quite yet. :-/</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry about the rant. Just wanted to get it out there, in somewhere I hoped might be mutually supportive. Hope you're all doing ok. &lt;3</p>

        <p>This was my follow-up comment, which they also removed before it could even post:</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that... My mental health has been so bad, and I've felt so isolated and lonely, during this last six months (mostly my own fault, I admit, but you'd like to think your friends would reach out, at least, ya know..? Narrator: "They didn't."), that I'm not all that sure that I, personally, will make it through to mid-March, when the Australian Government is considering letting us travel overseas again...</p>
<p>This is not "a cry for help", and it's not necessarily a statement of intent, either. I'm just saying that... I'm not sure I can hang in there. I'll try. Not for my family. Not for anyone (after all, I don't really have anyone that I actually... Love enough to live for, as sad as that is). But maybe for myself. Maybe I can keep going, just to... Prove that even with all the shit I've experienced in my life, and everything that I've missed out on, you can still get through it, and... Live.</p>
<p>I dunno. We'll see. But my mental health has rarely ever been darker, I'll say at least that much. :-/</p>

        <p>re: early removal, they might have a policy in place to automod posts/comments coming from new accounts (yours being only a month old)</p>

        <p>Ah, see, I didn't break any rules, but the reason the specific mod gave, which I argued with, is that they don't allow "Personal Experience/Vent" style posts... And that they will only allow posts with "verified links" (i.e. mine had none, because it was just my experience), from now on...</p>
<p>This seemed really odd, to me, and directly contradicts with what I have seen there previously, so... Either they've changed their unwritten rules/policies (there's nothing in the sidebar which suggests what this mod said, but I've experienced this sort of shite on other subs... Unwritten, and selectively enforced), or this mod was just being picky/hypocritical/inconsistent.</p>
<p>Dunno. I argued those points. I guess we'll see what they have to say, if anything.</p>

<p>Here in this sub we are a lot more relaxed and almost anything goes (except for trolls from the rest of reddit who simply want to come here and shit on everybody). But personal experiences, venting, silly memes, etc - it's all welcome.</p>

        <p>Awesome! Yeah that sounds great!
Honestly, I feel like LC used to be (more) like that, or at least it appeared to be, from what I saw...</p>
<p>So either something has changed (new mods, perhaps?) in recent weeks, since I and others I've talked to last paid it much attention, or this is an unwritten rule, that like I said, is only being applied selectively (which makes me wonder if, again, it depends on who the mod is who sees it!)...</p>
<p>Eh, idk. Anyway, screw 'em. Like you said, I'm glad I found this place/sub instead. Much better. :-) Confirmed by literally everything anyone has said so far, ha.</p>

        <p>Oh, I also just remembered, one of the most recent "personal experience" posts I saw on there, a few weeks back, was from someone who made a throwaway pretty much just to post it, because she was so cagey about "privacy" (she literally didn't even want to say which country she lived in, which was... A little odd.), so that's one of the things which really made it seem like this was massively inconsistent and hypocritical!
And from that, we can also pretty definitely say they don't care about "account age" of the poster/commenter, lol...</p>

        <p>This sub is the most free I've felt on reddit in a very long time. Normally I avoid any and all news / politics subs, or any discussion in another subreddit that is remotely adjacent to those subjects, because invariably you'll get dogpiled for WrongThink.</p>
<p>It's a shame, because reddit was just amazing 10 years ago - a completely different website, filled with all kinds of fundamentally libertarian, pro-free-speech advocates. All kinds of offensive subs were allowed to exist - if you didn't like it, well, don't go there!</p>
<p>But the more popular reddit got, the more money they had flowing in, the more of a leftist hivemind censorship-happy circlejerk it turned into. Now all that's left are little pop-up subs like this one, that live for awhile, then die when they get quarantined/banned. We all know it's coming, just not when precisely.</p>
<p>Enjoy the freedom while it lasts!</p>

        <p>&rt; I know this won't seem like a fair reason either. But there has been a LOT of coverage about the media promoting fear, ironically from the media itself. Even in the form of original essays and posts. Also with videos and such. I am sorry if this feels like a harsh made up reason. I am not trying to deny your experiences as unique.</p>
<p>That's part of what they wrote. Odd. Doesn't stack up with my experience of the MSM at all, lol...
But that's who I'm dealing with/decided my perspective wasn't "unique or missing" enough. So... Eh. Can't be bothered arguing with them, honestly...</p>

        <p>So yeah, I guess my opinion and experience isn't considered "significant enough" to matter to that sub..?</p>
<p>Really sucks, especially since other people with exactly the same sort of vent post are allowed through all the time. I guess the mod/s took a particular dislike to something I said. :-/</p>
<p>I don't mind if you apply your veto powers similarly, I guess, on this sub, as long as you are at least consistent. If not (as on LockdownSkepticism) - well, I don't think that's fair at all. But I guess it's their sub.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you have to hear the news all the time; that would upset me as well (not to mention being around family who are difficult to get along with)!  </p>
<p>Hope you get to return to your state soon!  You all seem to have had some of the worst restrictions in Australia.  I don't think I would have survived for long if I had been there.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone will remove your comment here.  You can probably turn it into a post here as well if you want more conversation/replies.  I see other posts here like it all the time, so I don't think anyone will delete it if you do.  We have other people from Australia here too, so if you make it into a post they may see it and you might even meet someone from your area.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much for this! &lt;3</p>
<p>Yeah, a lot of that is what I was expecting/hoping for from LockdownSkeptics... Interesting that it doesn't appear to be that way anymore. Or it's selective, anyway.</p>
<p>So... IDK. Guess I've found here, now, hey?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again. I'll be right, hopefully. :-) Can't let all the Reddit BS get to me (and there is so, so much BS, as I'm sure you know, lol), right?</p>

<p>Your comments and posts are always welcome here! Sometimes it just helps to write things down.  It's understandable the way you feel; up until when I moved about a month ago, it was a really dark year for me too mentally.  </p>
<p>You're right, there's a lot of crazy places in reddit where people just fight and I stay away from those.  </p>

        <p>If you are ever curious as to what your local hospitals look like right now, I found out yesterday that all the admissions stats are public data- https://www.ahd.com/</p>
<p>Just search for the hospital and then when you click on it, scroll to “Beds and Patient Days by Unit”.</p>
<p>Might want to check that when someone makes the “our hospitals are overwhelmed” argument.</p>
<p>Edit- make sure you verify the date using this search- some hospitals may not be up to date.</p>

        <p>Just went to the mall in forever since I got off work early. Every store has a different opening time. 
Was going to Sephora for Xmas gift for the wife and they had on Yelp 10am. No didn’t open til 11. I have a gaiter and ear loop “single layer “ mask from Etsy. Which either is on for my Costco job. And anywhere I shop at. I stop at Disney to see what they had for my kids. 
I’m stopped by a big guy aka enforcer joe who reiterated the garbage they are taught to spit out. He rants in semi professional tone that gaiters are not safe. So I drop it down and grab my mask that I wear to work all the time. No he says single alter isnt any good either. 
Please take one of our blue medical mask. 
Huh?!?. You really dont want my business. 
I really wanted to blow up in the guy but didn’t feel like going to jail. </p>
<p>When did Disney cashiers become virology experts ? Only reason I got a fairer on is it’s cold out and snowing/snowed. And I drive forklift in the cooler.</p>

        <p>Can someone explain in rational terms why gaiters are alleged to be especially unsafe, versus a typical cloth mask?</p>
<p>ALL masks seem like theater to me (side jets etc), but how exactly are gaiters supposed to be worse than a smaller mask that only covers the nose/mouth?</p>
<p>And I mean shit, people are walking around with open face shields which is just beyond comical if we're talking about stopping the transmission of droplets and particles through the air.</p>

        <p>Here is the answer. The ONLY thing that will change any of the power-grab politics is our money. It's tough to do because of the ease of the "Big Box" stores who are under the thumb of the gubment, but I am trying my best to spend all of our dollars at local owned, smaller businesses. Typically they are the ones who don't care about masks either. If the big corporations start to feel it, they will stop paying off the politicians and all of the sudden Supreme Medical Expert Fauci will change his mind (again) and all of this will go away.</p>

        <p>That will fail. TPTB also make and control our money. They can create unlimited money whenever they want. If you spend it all at local businesses then they can just print more of it for big businesses. Try playing monopoly but then make a rule that your opponent can give himself as much money as he wants whenever he wants during the game. That's the game that you're playing.</p>

        <p>There are no local small businesses in my area anymore. Maybe a few bars and liquor stores, but I don't drink alcohol. Only place to shop local is Walmart and other big corps. I don't have gas money to drive out of town to support non-local small businesses, nor do I have money for shipping to order from small businesses online.</p>

        <p>I did an Instacart order in Wegmans (Northeast supermarket chain) and when I was shopping, an announcement came on the intercom that said something like “Attention Wegmans employees. Please finish your transactions and then take this time to thoroughly wash your hands. We appreciate you being here during this difficult time.” </p>
<p>My mom said when she has shopped there they will occasionally come on the PA and announce it’s time to clean the registers or the shelves.</p>
<p>Could you imagine going to work and getting treated like you’re in a kindergarten classroom? I’ve done IC in about four other stores and Shipt in one (Shipt is blah for where I live but that’s another story) and Wegmans is the only store I’ve heard these announcements at.</p>

        <p>One thing I've noticed about almost everybody who comes here to attack - they always try to virtually ostracize you, as if that makes any difference online.</p>
<p>It's the most predictable normie tactic: social shaming. They think their own viewpoints are driven purely by objective evaluation of reality around them, without regard for social dynamics, yet when a disagreement arises the FIRST thing they reach for is, "Oh yeah? Nobody likes you, loser!"</p>

        <p>First problem with their approach: most of us here are tough people who will not be swayed by attacks like that</p>
<p>Second problem with their approach: once you've shunned everyone for wrongthink, social shaming no longer works. We've already lost all our friends, what more do we care about our social standing?</p>

<p>I agree though. But considering how many cases of obesity are the result of lifestyle choices - unlike old age, which is pretty much inevitable if you love long enough - any precautions should be on them and those closest to them. Not anyone else.</p>

        <p>Well, the mod of my hometown sub is now deleting <em>any</em> comments that challenge the rhetoric and narrative of 'the experts' on TV. </p>
<p>My region is in a bubble of regions that is not going into lockdown next week so in a discussion post about that on my hometown sub, one redditor - clearly with critical thinking skills, argued against the lockdowns and provided reasoning behind his comments... How the death rate is much lower than previously thought, how the lockdowns and restrictions are targeting the wrong places, how people's mental health as well as physical health has deteriorated over the course of the pandemic, how there's been irreparable damage to the economy and people's livelihoods due to this, etc etc...</p>
<p>In response <em>of course</em> he got a flurry of "fuck you you idiot!" and "kindly shut the fuck up" responses... You know, the usual polite retorts from people who disagree with someone that challenges the popular (and ignorant) opinion... But I was disappointed to see the mod delete ALL his comments and sticky a note at the top of the thread that said "Adding to this that trying to convince people this "just isn't a big deal" when thousands of people are dying, alone, in a cold hard hospital room crying, gasping for breath over zoom, it's just not cool, and isn't going to be allowed here. You want to cry about how much it sucks, try watching your loved ones die from Covid and I promise you'll change your time. Please take conspiracy theories, and false information, or reduction of importance somewhere else".</p>
<p>I challenged him on it and replied to the mod and said nothing the redditor said was a conspiracy theory or wrong... It was just a different opinion and not worthy of being deleted... But the mod just dug his heels in and went on to reply with hyperbole about how if everyone in Canada got infected, 380K people would die and that would be "8x the Canadian soldiers that died in WWII"... Okay? Not everyone is going to get infected... So what the fuck is that comment about?</p>
<p>He deletes all these comments from someone because he personally disagrees with them and claims he's spreading "misinformation", but then casually makes up a hyperbolic, misleading stat. Make it make sense.</p>
<p>But like everything in this pandemic, nothing has made sense. So I shouldn't be shocked. I'm just irked and need to cleanse my brain here after seeing so much idiocy yet again.</p>

        <p>Summer now here in Chile. Got out of a hard 4 month lockdown a little while ago where we couldnt even leave the house without permission. Thought we were free for the summer at least but its not looking too good. Santiago just went back to  stricter level of lockdown and now cannot travel technically i think, or leave their house on the weekends without permission. </p>
<p>I live on the beach in a different city, but now the beaches are freaking empty. All the tourists from Santiago are locked in their city and cant come. Its a sad sad sight. All the beach vendors are just sitting there making no money. We rely on that summer tourist money and now its been denied for who knows how long. </p>
<p>Had to deal with a cover your nose mask nazi cashier at the beach coffee shop today and fill out contract tracing info, and its no surprise I aint exactly happy lol. This is all some fucking bullshit.</p>

        <p>Every single day I am again shocked by the lunatic myopia displayed by the covid crowd. They’re concerned about elderly people who are probably already older than the average age of death, but not concerned about those same elderly peoples quality of life. They’re concerned about this virus which is extremely survivable, but not concerned about stopping all preventive medical care, or the suicides and drug overdoses that are happing at increased rate. What’s going on that people are unable to see the big picture? </p>
<p>A friend of mine in California, who I generally consider very sensible and I’d not especially scared, still cannot seem to see the big picture of what a going on. The same with my own mother. Many conversations lots of links shared, she seems to get it. But then next conversation it feels like she has regressed back towards justifying these measures. </p>
<p>There’s no logic or reason anymore. I am so frustrated and angry, sad, and rage-filled. I’m not sure I can ever forgive the collaborators.</p>

        <p>Was taking my mother grocery shopping yesterday and I was waiting in the car and noticed these 2 older ladies walk past both had masks on walking to the door of the grocery store so I made eye contact quickly and smiled.</p>
<p>One lady did not react but the other lady started giving me a death stare the whole way past my car I can only assume it's because I did not have a mask on.... i was kinda flabbergasted and honked at her when she was behind me but she did not turn around then my mom came out of the store and asked why I was honking at her I explained the situation and she said oh fuck that lady lets go home</p>
<p>I live in a small town of 10k people in Ontario and that happens more than not if your not wearing a mask you get shamed with looks it's fucking sad how compliant people are and how they have to devolve into the shaming mentality. </p>
<p>The compliance is honestly worse in my small town than bigger ones I was in Mississauga the other day and I saw a 30 something-year-old Indian(maybe Muslim idk did not see her well) lady walk into a petro Canada without a mask straight by 2 people no fear whatsoever god what a beautiful confident women I'm a 21-year-old guy and have done that in dollar stores but never grocery stores a petro would be doable but I could see it on her face she did not have fear I wanna be like that lol...</p>
<p>the problem is shopping alone if you were 2 people not wearing masks would be a lot harder to push you around...</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, I just need to balls up and do what u/No-NPC-HERE does just walk in without a mask and ask them to get you one if they hassle you... I have done that at an LCBO</p>
<p>Living in a small town I see the door guards at the grocery stores fuck I even know some of them so it's hard to be non-compliant but at the end of the day it's my decision and no one else can do it for me.</p>

        <p>Thank you. Just a quick reminder, though. I don't ask them to get me a mask if they tell me something about wearing one. 
I politely but CONFIDENTLY say I can't wear a mask. And I DO NOT STOP WALKING.</p>

        <p>Hey there. I feel you, I’m also in small town Ontario. Conversely I have had the most issue with people in Toronto, and out here in the sticks I just say I’m exempt and go on as normal. I have not worn a mask yet, and will continue to hold out as long as possible. My advice is to be confident and keep walking, don’t stop and entertain a conversation. Also don’t worry too much about anyone person comments, you have no idea what’s going on with them. Possibly just a bad day. It’s lawsuit be to de-personalize these people’s behavior if posible, it’s not about you, it’s about them. Good luck.</p>

        <p>200+ Minnesota restaurants were going to open this week despite the governor's orders. I had a few that I was going to visit but they all backed out. So yeah, can't understate what a letdown this whole thing has turned out to be. I was so hopeful at the beginning of the week thinking I was actually going to be able to eat at a restaurant again, that there'd be news coverage of people eating out in restaurants like normal that might facilitate a shift in public sentiment. I went and got like $200 cash from the bank for tips and now there's nowhere in a reasonable distance that I can spend it on.</p>

        <p>Honestly, my frustration comes from so many people talking about 'mainstream media' being the cause behind the pandemic, but they never seem to read through actual scientific journals. Even when they do, it's poor science at best and at worst it's pseudoscience. The use of 'doomers' is also incredibly perplexing along with this weird narrative of fear. No one believes that humanity will come to an end, but that we should protect as many people as possible. There are long term effects of the virus on people, young and old, and we don't know how long until they see a complete recovery. There's even the point of elderly people and people with comorbidities being more prone to severe cases of COVID-19. How many people in the US alone are obese or have diabetes? Hell, how many have heart disease? Everyone is acting like wearing a mask, not being around a ton of people, and trying to eat outside is some kind of massive issue when it's not. The pandemic sucks, but we're not going to get through it unless we start acting together and understand the causes. Look, don't listen to CNN or Fox or any other news outlet. They are only after ratings. Read papers, not articles.</p>

<p>The gov response to Covid, at least in America, has put paranoid and often worthless security theater front and center while relegating kids and working people to second class citizens. And all of it in the name of safety. This goes well beyond face coverings and concerts.</p>

<p>Wearing a mask and social distancing do fuck all compared to actually being healthier because that would require effort and doomers like to just pop on a mask and act like they are a hero.</p>
<p>Imagine if gyms had remained open all this time and the media had used its power for good and encouraged healthier practices in order to better fight off illnesses in general, not just covid. Probably prevent quite a few more deaths than a mask would.</p>
<p>So yes masking up is a massive issue because I'd say a lot of us here aren't lazy and already know how to take care of ourselves.</p>

<p>FTFY: I lost my business due to lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt; We all should have planned better for emergencies.</p>
<p>Businesses planned for emergencies like fires by purchasing insurance. As nobody has ever been dumb enough to implement insane ideas like lockdown before, businesses never thought to plan for it. How could you possibly plan for it?? Do businesses plan for emergencies like "alien invasion" or "zombie apocalypse"? No! Because it's simply impractical to plan for every possible event no matter how unlikely they are.</p>

        <p>Actually I shut down on my own. I could have stayed open. Our state never really had a lockdown that effected more than maybe 5% of the businesses in the state. Unless you normally had people packed in nut to butt you clouds stay open.
Having a healthy reserve fund for your company allows you to ride out any emergency, or problem not covered by insurance. Like because of the bad economy I lost my biggest supplier. I couldn’t find another one that I liked on such short notice so I can’t get more product. That was my fault for not researching back up suppliers sooner. 
Eventually my reserve fund was eaten up by my basic overhead and taxes and that’s all she wrote. I just thank god I wasn’t in debt</p>

        <p>Actually the idea behind masks and lockdowns is that it would slow the spread, not completely eradicate the disease. Without preventative measures, by that logic, we all would have already had the virus and this would all be over.</p>
<p>Of course, the preventative measures didnt work anyway. But thats not the point.</p>
