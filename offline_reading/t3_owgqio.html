    <strong>Can we talk about friends and family coming out of the woodwork all of a sudden? “PLEASE GET VAXXED!”</strong>
    <p><p>On Saturday morning I woke up to a text from a good friend of mine saying she hoped I was vaxxed because she didn’t want me to die. It struck me as really odd because she and I don’t text often and have never discussed our vax statuses before. I asked her “why do you say that?” Thinking she might reveal how she even knows I’m not vaxxed and why she felt so compelled to say something out of the blue. (Did she see my random comment on a mutual facebook friend’s post about the vaccine?) but she just replied in a string of fearmongering messages about how the icus were filled, delta is as contagious as chicken pocks, yada yada. I asked myself if it was even real. Like is this one of those copy and paste things again? Felt so weird. Like she apparently felt “scared” enough for my life that she messaged me?? Idk … it just doesn’t seem like her. And we had actually just chatted on the phone a week ago. So if she was really concerned about me, why wouldn’t she bring it up then and confirm that I’m vaxxed? Maybe she assumed I was this whole time ? But then she saw my one remark on Facebook?? Idk but It’s scary like people are talking about a switch being flipped. </p>
<p>I ended up replying explaining my rational position of why I’m going be be fine and why it’s futile to get vaxxed. no response since.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe the vax is turning people into government drones. MK Ultra is alive &amp; well &amp; they’ve finally found the secret to human mind control. Lol not likely, but could you imagine? I think these people are just scared little sheep.</p>

        <p>I am in the midst of reading, Poisoner in Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control by Stephen Kinzer. That’s why I thought of this. Pretty insane non fiction book about how utterly FUCKED the CIA was (still is). I wouldn’t put it past TPTB to create a pandemic &amp; scare everyone into taking their mind control jab. I really don’t believe that this technology exists, right now. However, it wouldn’t surprise me if it did &amp; I 100% believe they’d use it against the people.</p>

        <p>I have a cousin who has known my stance on the covid stuff the entire time. She never showed any problem with it before. She knew I was unvaxxed, I knew she was vaxxed, life went on.</p>
<p>In the spring, she agreed to come and take photos for our extended family. Then, suddenly, she backed out. She said it was due to my "approach to covid". Uh.... you mean the approach to covid that you've known I had this entire time....??? WTF.</p>

        <p>Same here. Recently vaxxed in-laws have decided, after spending the last 18 months with us unmasked, going on vacation, going for lunches every second weekend, that they can’t be around us anymore, we’re not allowed inside their house or around their dog (??) and the entire family has banned us from the last funeral that occurred and seeing another dying family member in their care home (even though the care home doesn’t require visitors to be vaxxed). </p>

        <p>Oh my goodness that is madness and awful!!!! It’s all so backwards. You’d think that people would have been this crazy and cautious back when none of us were vaccinated, but now that some people are “protected” with the vaccine, now is when they’ve decided to treat us like hazards to their health. Makes no sense. Per usual.</p>

        <p>My Gramma called the other day and immediately went into the covid narrative about how she hopes I'm staying safe. I kind of went off. I told her I don't watch the news or read it and don't want to hear about covid ever again. I also told her if she's too scared for us to come visit, then we won't. Haven't seen her in two years because of last year's restrictions. Anyway Gramma STFU about it and I hope she knows to never bring it up again. She should've known better, but now she better damn well know better. I love her to death, but I'm not sparing her feelings about this shit because I mentally can't handle it anymore. How is she still even around with a deadly pandemic wreaking havoc? She's over 90 and lives with someone who works with tons of sick people almost every day. I will lose it if she wears a mask while I'm visiting.</p>

        <p>This was the most recent post made by a friend of mine in response to a fucking meme. It's the one of a dude sitting at a table of money and it says "Pfizer after telling everyone they need a third shot."</p>
<p>&rt;if every dipshit antivaxxer swallowed their pride and just got the shit done this would all be over with and we wouldn't need a third booster shot. I know good, kind, amazing people who died to this shit because of irresponsible jackasses having zero empathy for anybody but themselves, putting their egos in front of the face of reality and spitting on science because the idea that they might be wrong about something is too hard for them to fathom. It's easier for some people to double down on watching Alex Jones conspiracy theory videos than simply to look in the mirror and ask themselves whether they might be wrong and how they can better themselves and learn from their mistakes to make the world a better place. It shouldn't be hard, but 4.23 million dead people say otherwise.</p>
<p>I love the playbook, mention deaths, then mention your knew people who died. </p>
<p>I have yet to know anyone who died FROM covid. I know plenty of old and sick people who died with it.</p>

        <p>Hmm sorry that I chose to respect my own bodily health over the health of millions of fucking strangers. Infuriating isn’t it? That you took a big risk with your health and I didn’t. How unfair. We certainly should all choose the abstract and indirect concept of making the world a better place over our individual survival.</p>
<p>Dump that friend!</p>

        <p>My aunt messaged me and my boyfriend out of the blue with a message just like that. It was really really odd. I am a young 20 something totally healthy and she felt so compelled as to text me and cross boundaries as if I don’t already know my options?</p>
