    <strong>Stop mocking/attacking people who are just following the rules</strong>
    <p><p>Recently I've been seeing an increasing number of posts which are targeting 'doomers', those who choose to get vaccinated, or simply those who are following the guidelines that have been set before them. For the most part, <strong>the people following the rules  are not the problem. The problem is the rules themselves.</strong> Furthermore, mocking and attacking the people who have fully bought in to this pandemic only hurts the chances of having an actual dialogue with them. These type of posts and comments add nothing to the conversation and only legitimize actual arguments. <strong>Stop polarizing the issues, it's the last thing we need right now.</strong></p></p>

        <p>The people following the rules are perpetuating the problem by following the rules- which are patently absurd and even criminal. The same argument is presented by every culpable organ in any atrocity you care to mention: “I was just following orders.”</p>

        <p>Agreed, that's why I'm saying to stop attacking and mocking them, not to stop disagreeing with them. If all they see is a group of people whose arguments are personal and demeaning they'll never come to the table to listen to the actual points that can be made.</p>

        <p>Leaving aside the fact that ad hominem attacks are about all our oppressors have conditioned people to engage in rather than debate, if folk haven’t snapped out of the TV trance after an entire year, it’s slim pickings now, I’m sorry to say. Which is not to say that your point is not taken, I just don’t think it’s applicable in the current circumstances. People are shell-shocked and fear is the overriding impulse right now. Reasoned debate has never prevailed in fear-fuelled public hysterias. I’m not writing this to excuse anyone or anything, but there’s really nothing civil about what’s going on at any level. Calling out normal, healthy people who don’t wish to wear a mask or introduce some unknown, experimental serum into their biochemistry as “anti-mask” and “anti-vaccine” is downright sinister. Nothing on this sub approaches that level of malice.</p>

        <p>I've already done that for a year.</p>
<p>I don't wish any harm on any one individual.  But as a group, they deserve to be mocked, and mocked mercilessly.  What they have done to us is simply outrageous and reprehensible.  I will never take these people seriously ever again. </p>
<p>If I had my way I would just leave this society and live with other like minded people.  I don't care to talk to or negotiate with the miserable people who have done this to us ever again.</p>

        <p>Well, extremists always exist. I completely agree with you that there are some people who have been vocal and deserve to eat their words (and they very likely will someday). Sure, fuck those people. But, understand that there is a much larger percentage of people who are kind of skeptical about this whole thing. They're pissed off too. We need to speak logically to these people and not personally attack them, or else these types of views will always be seen as "conspiracy theories".</p>

        <p>I've spoken calmly and logically to people all year.  I have not been given the same respect.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for an apology, or some acknowledgement, for the amount of pain and suffering these people have caused.  Not a single one of these Doomers has said they were sorry for what they have done to me and millions of others like me.</p>
<p>Until I see that happen, I will not be negotiating with these people.  I no longer take them seriously.  They have demonstrated themselves not only to be stupid, but stubborn, hypocritical, mean spirited, selfish, immature, unreasonable, lacking in perspective, lacking in empathy, lacking in humanity.</p>
<p>And trust me.  It will get worse.  Once they realize the vaccine isn't saving them, watch how quickly they blame us.  </p>
<p>Fuck them.  I don't want to live in a world with them.  I don't care.</p>

<p>On top of that, people failing to think for themselves and believing whatever pop media shoves down their throats are also the problem.</p>

        <p>I agree with you but I'm not going to tone-police here. I encourage everyone to be patient and kind with these kids because they likely have no role models in their real life. But I also recognize that this is the number one place for people to aggregate whose lives have been fucked up by the media and government fearmongering.</p>

        <p>Well said OP.</p>
<p>I know I too often "attack" the people that's just following the rules too. Here and in real life.
I sometimes feel double sorry. 
First, that I may step on some toes for pushing my agenda on to people, when second, they have been scared by Govs and media for a year.</p>
<p>And it frustrate me, when "people of power" scare my fellow humans for only two reasons. Profit and control.</p>
<p>And.. Sometimes I think I have a hair trigger when I think I argue with shills or bots.</p>
<p>And sometimes I just want to shake some senses in to people. But that's kind of a wrong approach.</p>
<p>We ALL should be on the same team, against the "powerful".</p>
