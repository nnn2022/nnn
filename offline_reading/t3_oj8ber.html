    <strong>"Die offs" coming fall 2021 or next flu season?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys! So I just have an honest question. Many have talked about the vaccine being a depopulation tool and that due to the vaccine, about 90% of the population will be dead come next flu season. Whether its because the vaccine will destroy the immune system or spike proteins. Is this really gonna happen or are we just fearmongering ourselves? 
I'm not judging anyone or sure of either argument.  I've heard both. Is this actually gonna happen and should I have vaxxed loved ones rewrite their wills? I'm genuinely curious. Will the vaccines really kill off that many people come so soon? Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit, the other reason I wonder if this is a depopulation agenda is the many innocent people dying and many world figures stating they wish to reduce the world population to a certain number, I've heard 500 million once or twice (georgia guidestones) I've even heard others say they wish to use a virus to kill off humanity. (The last king of England said something about that too) So...I hope everyone can see why I'd ask that.</p></p>

        <p>I suppose my other question is if this is true, how exactly would the vaccine do that? How does it weaken the immune system. I honestly don't know that much about it so idk how it supposedly works other than some basic mrna/gene therapy stuff</p>

        <p>Glad you asked. For me the biggest tipping point is <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfOjvfjFwOg&amp;feature=youtu.be">this video</a>, where someone working in mRNA vax projects testified under NJ senate, where he described how many animals in experiment did not survive when re-introduced to natural pathogens despite some promising early results. The human analogy would be that those with weak immune systems will get hit very hard by other pathogens so that abnormally high death rates would occur</p>

        <p>I saw one credible guy who said that based on animal trials, and the relative mouse-to-human time ratio, he expected significant human dieoff in about 1.5 years. </p>
<p>According to other authorities, the covaxx also has sterilization properties, so I think it is sort of a multi-tool, with action on more than one front. </p>
<p>It is a massive experiment for sure. Results should be interesting, for those still around to see them.</p>

        <p>There’s no way to know for sure until it happens, if it happens. 
If I had to guess I would say Pharma will be busting out some therapeutics to remedy this problem, after all they have over 73 patents related to this, including a patent of the spike protein as a bio weapon. 
If I had to guess Moderna is going to go wild and experiment with their whole “operating system” and like a computer you may need to download new software from time to time. When they use the phrase “plug and play” it makes me think they have all sorts of cocktails waiting to test on their human subjects trying to remedy the inevitable immune system catastrophe.</p>

        <p>Honestly, we have been right about everything since Jan 2020. Why would we be wrong now? You need to ask yourself a simple question: Why are all the countries syncing their vaxx mandates? It's because they want "whatever will happen" to occur simultaneously around the world. If the ADE deaths would happen after years, there would never have been this mad push to get everyone vaxxed before the northern hemisphere's winter.</p>

        <p>It's soooooooooooooooooooo obvious! If the unvaxxed countries in Africa see that the vaxxed North Americans and Europeans are facing extinction, they will refuse the vaxxes. Solution? Synchronise the vaxxes and wipe out everyone at once.</p>

        <p>That's a bit overkill imo... It could cause alot of problems in a longer period of time, maybe 5-15 years when it's harder to put a finger to a certain vaccine. More cancers, neurological issues, heart failures, fertility problems and so on. They will be just considered normal in the future, shit happens you know. If the mortality rate goes up just slightly due to these injections no1 will care or notice, it's millions of people though... Maybe more.</p>

        <p>If the shots were that effective at killing people, they wouldn't have bothered to make them sterilizing agents as well. They won't kill everyone who gets them and they won't sterilize everyone who gets them. It will take time and many boosters. Also, they have many other tricks up their sleeves such as food shortages and causing deaths of despair. They <em>hope</em> that all these things combined will result in an eventual 94% world population decrease.</p>
