    <strong>Sudden immunity realisation! Whoa........</strong>
    <p><p>Work through a group of thoughts I've had with me:</p>
<p>Getting the "vaccine" doesn't make you immune, but only lessons the symptoms as we've been told.</p>
<p>Therefore - that means getting COVID makes that "second infection" have less symptoms.</p>
<p>This is due to both the vaccine and infections producing a fairly similar immune response (but not quite the same!). In fact the vaccine is said to be better as it's less specific. ( a lie as I'll explain)</p>
<p>At no point does anyone say the vaccine makes us IMMUNE. Like a normal vaccine would.</p>
<p>This suggests that getting COVID too does not make us immune to it, and therefore we can catch it multiple times. (remember the vaccine works better than a natural infection, and we're told we can still catch COVID after getting the vaccine)</p>
<p><strong>BUT we're told we can't catch COVID more than once - there's only a handful of apparent re-infections on record before the vaccine was created.</strong></p>
<p>THEREFORE - someone's lying about re-infections....</p>
<p>If the vaccine is BETTER than getting COVID (as we're told it is) - we wouldn't get reinfected, same as we don't after getting COVID naturally.
If it's WORSE protection than natural COVID immunity - we can get re-infected... which we're told can actually happen.</p>
<p>So the situation is - we're all being something that reduces symptoms (making mutations more likely to spread, as people are up and around and going to work!) but does NOT infect us the same way COVID does.</p>
<p>So "herd immunity" isn't coming from the vaccine, but from people getting COVID and THEN becoming immune properly. Simply put - we're all going to have to get COVID...</p>
<p>This is VERY risky due to the chance of vaccine escape... if it goes wrong we ALL end up with a serious COVID infection that could kill us, Vs the POTENTIAL of the current type of COVID to kill us.</p>
<p>All this is kept quiet... we've had the decision made for us, and if it doesn't work out, 2021/22 will be the years that everything goes to hell.</p>
<p>If it does work out, no one will ever be told how risky this leaky vaccine approach was...</p></p>

        <p>This train of thought (which I agree with) is very dangerous, as it leads to only one conclusion. I refused and refused to believe it , before finally accepting it for what it is- Designed population control.  It is the only conclusion you can come too for the exact reasons you stated.</p>

        <p>I hate that this keeps going through my head but the levels of censorship are reaching uncomfortable levels.</p>
<p>If they didn't have anything to hide: why are people being discredited and silenced for speaking out - for asking questions.</p>
<p>Internet whitewashing whenever someone discovers something out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>It just feels so off. I can't explain it.</p>

        <p>What you say here is exactly the reason many people that are less completely mentally controlled are waking up to the reality that there has been a major shift in the paradigm. </p>
<p>What feels of that you can't put your finger on, exactly? 
I believe it is that, although I presume many here on this sub always recognized the media as a propaganda organ, we do remember when they did provide some useful information that was at least partially truthful, sometimes. Not anymore!
Now the only way we can get any viable info is to play the same game that they play with the truth; that is to say, invert it again... or look deeper into what we are told to ignore. This is disturbing because it is a direct reflection of a greater paradigm shift in the way those who presume themselves to be our owners have decided to accelerate their agenda to totally control us, the serf masses. </p>
<p>When some of the people I converse with are among the lemmings, they have compared me to a "flat earther" for my distrust of the objectively false official narrative. I am quick to point out to them that the ptb leave those nutters alone in their lunacy, because they are already sterilized in their disconnection with reality. We do not see their videos and post getting removed from platforms or their pages getting memory holed from the www. That is obviously NOT the case with anyone that starts to get any traction with claims against the whole 'rona scam, jab, or greater agenda for total control. This is called "milieu control" in the "eight criteria for thought reform". The fact that they are blatantly, flagrantly, and shamelessly using such programming tactics on what used to be the " free" world is pretty fucking disconcerting, any way you cut it. But try to find some comfort in the fact that we are not alone. Despite the efforts to try to marginalize us and group us with the flat earthers, it is pretty evident that we are really legion... look at all the protests world wide against this shit, and look at how they are ignored by the same inversionist propagand organs. 
As I have previously said, we must not allow them to demoralize us. We must not allow the darkness to have a monopoly in the propaganda field. If we do, these things are tantamount to our capitulation to the evil.</p>

        <p>I'm a proud flat earther, no kidding. If for no other reason than TPTB don't want me to be and make fun of such intellectual folly. That's OK. I don't need to know for sure what shape the earth is. Has no bearing on the task at hand, which is to be a good, God-loving human and to walk the straight and narrow.</p>

        <p>Well, on the shape of our biosphere, we are just going to have to agree to disagree. Any debate with you on the subject serves absolutely zero purpose on this sub and is in fact counter-productive. As long as you aren't part of cov-anon, I would consider someone that is critical of more of the pushed "truth" to be a greater ally than anyone screaming "tRuZt tHe sCIenZE"

        <p>Why didn’t they simply ask for volunteers then? All the world’s suicidal people would’ve stepped up. </p>
<p>I went through a traumatic divorce and then struggled with the death of mybest friend in 2018.  By first part of Dec 2019 my life was finally getting back on track. Enter March 2020. Now my world is back to worthless and hopeless and I’d happily volunteer for a depopulation jab.</p>

        <p>&rt; At no point does anyone say the vaccine makes us IMMUNE. Like a normal vaccine would.</p>
<p>Your definition of a vaccine is incorrect, very few (if any) vaccines actually makes you immune.</p>
<p>What they do is training your immune system to recognise the pathogen and have a better chance of fighting it when the wild variant comes along.</p>
<p>The covid vaccine will not eradicate ovid, but it will make the infection rate decrease instead of increase.</p>
<p>Chicken. Pox, flu etc all still exist, people still catch them even though they have been vaccinated. And just like with covid, symptoms of flu and chicken pox is severely reduced for a vaccinated person that ends up catching the live virus. And again just like covid vaccine will, flu and chicken pox vaccines have prevented many deaths.</p>

        <p>I wasn't able to find any definite info about if there are any vaccines that are 100% effective.</p>
<p>The best quote might be from the CDC:</p>
<p>&rt; no vaccine is actually 100% safe or effective for everyone because each person’s body reacts to vaccines differently.</p>
