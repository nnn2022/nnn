    <strong>Labour MP Jess Phillips: Moron of the century</strong>
    <p><p>In regards to the incident in which UK Cheif Medical Officer Chris Whitty was harassed by two boiiz:</p>
<p>"Labour MP Jess Phillips said Prof Whitty had been made to feel <strong>'awful  and uncomfortable'</strong> and issued a reminder that <strong>public figures 'are human  beings'."</strong></p>
<p>This has to be the most ironic response of all time, I'm truly sorry the demon hamster was made to feel slightly uncomfortable, by his own decision to walk around without security - an indicator of a certain naivete toward the human condition that underpins this whole fiasco. It would appear that Ms. Horse face has forgotten that this man and SAGE have attempted to destroy everything which makes us human for over a year now, pitting society into a great divide in the name of the almighty science.</p>
<p>Least we forget the double standards, misdemeanours, dodgy deals and outright lies perpetrated by these "public figures", that were aided and abetted by the fake news to put people in a perpetual state of terror from which some may never recover. No, it's obviously incomparable to some socially inept wanker facing 30 seconds of an awkward situation. Fuck right off!</p></p>
