    <strong>I used to love technology, now I hate it for allowing our ‘new normal’</strong>
    <p><p>So sorry if this is jumbled as this is just me getting this off my chest...</p>
<p>I grew up pretty much attached to my computer, and spent my teens speaking to overseas friends on AIM and MSN. I had barely any real life friends, and it allowed me to escape. As I grew up, I realised that socialising virtually is a good complement to real socialising - I.e speaking to your mates at night on messengers.</p>
<p>I really loved technology though. so much that I went to college to study IT and then to University to become a programmer, and I’ve now been a software developer for 10 years. It was a passion of mine but I never let it ruin my actual social life.</p>
<p>Now though, as my entire contact with the outside world exists in the form of squares on a screen, I am realising how much better the world would be without this technology. Every video call I have, work or personal, someone fills me with complete sadness. It’s the closest thing to real life interaction, yet just acts as a painful reminder of how lonely I am. I never want to have a video call again and it’s because of this, and other mental health deterioration due to lockdowns, that I’m seriously considering taking a few months off work and maybe never return, especially if this really is our new normal.</p>
<p>I no longer have a passion for technology. I have a passion for life, and right now ‘life’ doesn’t exist. We are simply avoiding death (well, for 0.03% of us...), and this simply can’t continue</p></p>

        <p>Social media is one of the worst things to happen to the modern world in the last 10-ish years. It's clearly been used by the powers that be to push their own agenda, while simultaneously putting down and delegitimizing dissenters.</p>
<p>If you ask me, companies like Google or Facebook are no better than the most unethical and morally bankrupt politicians, corporations, and governments of the past 50 years. That includes companies like Dow Chemical, the creators of Agent Orange.</p>
<p>There needs to be major pushback to these companies. Not some Unabomber style "return to the caveman ages" pushback, but rather a movement to force these companies to abandon their blatant double standards and biased enforcement of their own rules. </p>
<p>It isn't technology itself you should hate. It's the people creating it that are abusing it to further their own twisted ideologies.</p>

<p>This is the problem. People will always take technology and abuse it for their own goals.</p>
<p>I have WFH for the last 5 years or so. I prefer it. However I don't like being at home 24/7, especially when I have 99.97% chance of survival.</p>

        <p>Yep.  Recently heard someone talking about how wonderful lockdown was because it forced everyone to go to remote everything.  Totally ignoring the death of the human connection.</p>
<p>People are dying from lack of human contact and these people are happy because they can do their meetings with their fucking cocks out.</p>
<p>Despicable cowards.</p>

        <p>I joked in the past with my boyfriend about being addicted to his hugs because he's one of the very few people I want to hug (grew up being forced to give hugs when I was uncomfortable, so that number is tiny). I'm now wondering if such an addiction could exist because we don't live together and 2020 has made me crave physical affection from him like a drug.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry that happened to you.  Being forced to do anything is awful but hugs are very personal and special.  I hope you have found a way to heal.  I have been dealing with some forced hugs recently and i am very much still broken from it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I absolutely crave physical affection like a drug.  I feel like my body parts are starting to drift apart and I need someone to come in a squeeze me to keep from falling apart into a million pieces.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Praying we both get that physical affection we so need sometime sooner rather than later my friend.</p>

        <p>understandable</p>
<p>i had similar thoughts about this, already a bit before 2020 but now stronger than ever:</p>
<p>as most other people in western countries i have a job that basically requires me to sit at a pc 95%+ of the time</p>
<p>at least some of the things i do result in physical products i can show to people</p>
<p>but generally its all digital. all fake. we are all so detached from the physical world, its actually madness. really take a step back and observe: is it really work when you just sit at a desk for 8 hours and then go home to sit on a couch? </p>
<p>sure technology is great to watch movies play games or chat sometimes. but we let the Digital take over so much and it destroys the human part of humanity. </p>
<p>i am basically ranting about myself and shoukd finally become a carpenter or chicken farmer</p>

        <p>I know these feels. I write firmware and design electronics and do similar stuff to you. I consider myself an armchair futurist with a very deep knowledge of the history of computing, mechanical reproduction, material science, and so on - all things I use daily.</p>

<p>The lockdowns and the propaganda methods are a total shock to my entire landscape. I once hoped for a sort of techno-utopia that is now being offered, spuriously, by the WEF. They are using all the good that could have come from technology to do great evil. People I once respected like Kurzweil are now propagandists for transhumanism predicated on eugenics and a plutocratic desire to live forever. </p>
<p>They seem to be trying to convince us they can download a personality into a computer and they can do it any day now, etc. it is all gibberish.</p>

<p>And then they locked us down.</p>

        <p>I remember AIM 🤣 wow, yea I feel like it was cool back then before MySpace and then facebook. When we had emails and like wiki search and Carmen Sandiego 🤣, well maybe you had nicer parents than I did, but ok, things changed a LOT. Women's rights went from being about women having rights to vote, own property and their bodies to men being protected as women. Things have gone haywire in too short of a time.</p>

        <p>Remember when you and all your buddies would send each other gore and goatse and dumb memes about some guy who's smoking 50 cigarettes at once that says GENTLEMEN and Pepe the Frog looking sad with a shotgun in his mouth and you had a good laugh? I miss the internet before Facebook got big. It felt so free. Now it makes me feel trapped. I keep fantasizing about a big road trip like I did in the summer of 2019 but then waking up to reality and seeing it's the middle of winter in Canada, I can't drive across the border, and everywhere else I could drive to in Canada is also cold and just as closed and as stupid as it is here in Toronto. And I have no-one to go with because my friends who haven't turned doomer and cut me off all have bosses who would make them obey the quarantine law.</p>

        <p>Tech has been stagnant for like 10 years. That stagnation is in many ways how this has been allowed to happen. Zuckerberg and Jack should have gone the way of Tom a long time ago. Instead, an utter lack of compelling new solutions to the problems those platforms rose up to solve have kind of left them to dominate the space and carve up territory. The actions they are taking this week will definitely create a lot of new problems for a lot of people that tech can solve. So, hopefully this will reignite innovation in the tech space and get us out of this situation.</p>

        <p>&rt;I really loved technology though. so much that I went to college to  study IT and then to University to become a programmer, and I’ve now  been a software developer for 10 years.</p>
<p>Some time ago I looked into the specifics of how all these switches actually work on a fundamental level, and I found it unbelievable - the sheer concentration of utter brilliance that went into it all - and that applies even to every layer of computing technology. But it also made me sad that all of <strong><em>this</em></strong> is merely used and abused as yet another way to enslave people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I have a passion for life, and right now ‘life’ doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Well life imposes all kinds of urges and wants onto you, and the politician psychopaths torment you through preventing you to get a release of these and that further increases your suffering.</p>
<p>Much like waterboarding someone, but the one who gets waterboarded doesn't have "a passion" for breathing, they are simply suffering the unfulfilled urge to breath, as we are suffering our unfulfilled urges of socialization for example.</p>
<p>This distinction is important because life as a whole is otherwise commonly glorified, when it is the very source of the problem - that the politician scum deliberately make that much worse, for their own sadistic pleasure.</p>

        <p>Same here. Also in IT.</p>
<p>I think the thing is we can be happy turning inside and playing on the PC. But we still need some real life socializing. It's not the same level as for some -- like mandatory nonstop chit chat all day with strangers -- but there is still some amount needed. And that's not fulfilled.</p>

        <p>Instrumental reason, that is, the thinking that comes out of technological mindset, is at the core of everything, everything that is going awry. It drives:   </p>
<ol>
<li>Fauci’s convictions that nature is the biggest killer and that technology is the solution.</li>
<li>The overall idea that whatever nature does is bad (viruses, immune systems) and whatever science does is good (vaccines)</li>
<li>The entire direction of funding. All the grant money and funding sources come out of this mindset. Because the people who are successful are of this mindset, and they are the ones who rise to influence government, academia, not-for-profits.</li>
<li>Social media and msm. In an economy of scale (which is an economy of technology, without which scale of a sliver of this magnitude could not happen) the only way to succeed is by monopolizing attention for clicks and sponsors. You know how you get the most clicks? By being the most outrageous, fear mongering. The click imperitive has made news into a psychopath’s playpen. The journalists who succeed have the least concern for truth and the most concern for getting a rise out of people, riling people up, measuring success by how much they get under skin instead of anything moral.</li>
<li>Hollywood, Elon Musk, the sci-fi genre. People have seen hours and hours of junk in which the utopian fantasy of a human and robot can be meshed. The idea that artificial intelligence can come true, that humans can be robots and robots humans, that technology can solve everything without destroying more than it helps, all of these things come straight out of our fictional universe. And you know what? They are fiction! It can happen in movies that you invent a time machine and a lady robot who is supple and funny and empathetic. It can happen in movies that a killer virus comes and that a mad scientist, alone in his garage, discovers the cure and saves humanity. And you know what? People think they are just watching and having fun, but they are not! They are internalizing all of it and imagining themselves the heroes of these stories and looking around the world, anticipating the moment when this hero could be them! They are not only believing it, they are acting it out, willing it into existence! They, the prototype of this <em>they</em> being Fauci, are living life waiting for the moment when the movie can come to life. Look into Fauci, a real creeper. All of his funding allocations like the gain of function funding (see the New York Magazine article on the virus coming from a lab, they talk about gain of function) come straight out of this fucking insane mindset! The people with money and influence love this plot and they can’t have enough of it and they can’t wait to live it, like a tourist who can’t wait to visit the place they keep reading about. So they fund it and look for it and wait to spring into action. And their actions and modeling are sociopathic and unhinjed. Completely disconnected from humanness. Their solutions look so cool on sketches and as raw data and output models and they are the heroes just in the movies! But you know what, our incredibly wealthy and propogandistic movie industry keeps telling us that they are just entertainment. Just entertainment, sit back and let people enjoy themselves! In any culture, it is understood that entertainment carries moral value. But in ours, where greed is good and greed is god, Hollywood gets to claim that their fucked up violent fantasies are just a bit of distraction and some good business, that’s all. No, that’s not all! Hollywood is telling the stories for the technoutopian psychopaths and priming everyone to think they are stars of their own fucking stupid flick.</li>
<li>Most importantly for me, is the idea that technological language can explain everything. This worldview says that the whole world can be broken down into formulas and measurable data and you plug that into an algorithm and you get reliable, factual, actual information. See how this becomes the foundation for how we date, how we educate, how we model viruses and how we measure public sentiment. It all is bullshit. Tried dating online? Then you know that no matter how fancy the algorithm, you just CANNOT reduce life to the language of measurable parts. If you do, then you end up saying that anything that can’t be measured doesn’t matter. Viruses matter, but seeing faces doesn’t. Learning details about Abraham Lincoln matters, but social emotional health doesn’t. Grandma’s life matters, but her ability to live and love doesn’t.<br>
Here is something I recently read. About the power of words. I’ve been thinking on it. Having words for something not only allows us to talk about it, it allows us to <strong>THINK</strong> it. If we have words like artificial intelligence, virus, hardwire, algorithm, formula, system, etc then we can think about ourselves in those terms. But what happens when all our words are technological and we have no words for the HUMAN? Then we don’t even think of ourselves in human terms. We can’t think it! We say “my needs are that of a video game character because those needs I have words for. That’s it. Nothing more.” Because in a technological society, we have no words for more than that.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Look around and you’ll see that we are stuck in the joyride of meglomananiac billionaires from the techutopian mindset. They are surrounded by yes men and sycophants who have carried water for them and normalized their insanity. Look around and realize how we can no longer talk about ideas, we only talk about stats, charts, studies, values, percentages, proof, credentials. </p>
<p>Read old books and realize that once upon a time, you could talk about ideas without needing to defend human needs for community and socializing. Read the works of the Frankfurt School and of the Marshal McLuhan and Neil Postman times. At the dawn of the techno-utopian age, there was robust criticism of it. You know why? Because there was still a language for criticism. Now we are all entirely alienated. We are smug and cynical. We say nothing matters and laugh at people for being “triggered”. We dismiss fake internet points as if we, as humans, are impervious to the fake, when in reality our craving for social approval makes us such suckers for these points. We just do one thing - act human-ish - and say another, that other being that we are cool cucumber robot people. </p>
<p>Wake up. Reject instrumental reason. Reject humans as robots. Reject technology as superior to humanity. Get human, humane, humanist. It’s fucking lonely with all these hollowed out faceless goons.</p>
