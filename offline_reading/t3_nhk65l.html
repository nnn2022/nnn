    <strong>I'm being pressured to take the vaccine and I've run out of answers.</strong>
    <p><p>At this point, I'll take it just to get my family off my back.  It's not that I hate vaccines; I hate that I don't have genuine freedom to choose. It's either follow for approval or disobey and be shunned.  I'm trapped either way.  No answer or explanation will be good enough to justify my decision to remain as I am: 30, lifting weights at home, eating well and in high spirits (given the circumstances). I'm feeling healthier than ever and I'm not prone to getting sick.  I don't want a vaccine right now but I'm being perceived as selfish.</p></p>

        <p>Grow up, be your own person, and tell your family to eat shit. It's your body your choice. Not theirs. It's an experimental vaccine and you'll have the upper hand when they start experiencing side effects. Although it'll be sad since it's your family if they get side effects but they'll still be saying how they wished they'd have listened to you from the beginning</p>
<p>If they disown you over it, they weren't your family to begin with</p>

        <p>You have to choose: do you value your health or the opinions of others more? I can’t make that decision for you, but I can say it would be awfully weak-willed and self-hating to value others’ opinions over your own health and well-being. I hope you’ll find it in you to stand up for yourself.</p>
<p>In the mean time, let me remind you of some good reasons not to take the vaccine:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
