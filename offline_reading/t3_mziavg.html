    <strong>People who are anti-vaxxers, would you take a vaccine if exposed to rabies? [SERIOUS]</strong>
    <p><p>Rabies is some scary shit. You basically turn into a freaking zombie and die a slow and agonizing death while your brain is literally killing itself.</p>
<p>I guess the question is in the title. Please be respectful to each other!</p></p>

        <p>rabies is 100% fatal, and you take the vaccine after, and only after, an exposure. so gonna say yes because i don‚Äôt want to die. covid on the other hand is 99.8% survivable for someone my age, so wouldn‚Äôt take that vaccine.</p>

        <p>If you were eating out of a jar that had 3,000 skittles in it, and after your second handful someone told you that one of the skittles was laced with poison, and they offered you an antidote that saves your life if you ingest that type of poison, you would obviously take it.</p>
<p>So your rejection of the vaccine is either some cognitive failure, or it's purely psychological.</p>
<p>I feel like there's some kind of tribalism at play here, where it's making some people feel like it's "surrender" to take the vaccine. </p>
<p>My odds of surviving Covid are 99%, but I absolutely hate those odds. Again, if there was a jar that had 100 skittles and one of them was laced with cyanide, I would not eat any of them because a 1% chance of dying isn't a chance any rational person should ever take.</p>

<p>You literally just made up a number and asserted it as a fact, and you did so because you know you're on a sub where the hive mind tribalistically approves of the sentiment so no one will call you out on it, even though everyone knows you're unapologetically making up numbers.</p>
<p>I'm 43 and overweight with high blood pressure and asthma. My odds of surviving are about 99 to 99.5%. That makes me pretty much typical.</p>
<p>Also, very few people are 35 or under and perfectly healthy. You're talking about a small minority of the population.</p>

        <p>Nah actually I was recalling the numbers from this link <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mz1afk/i_like_science_too/">right here</a> and I was pretty damn close.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not my fault you‚Äôre fat and unhealthy. I‚Äôm not fat and I have no medical conditions cause I give a shit about my health and I did before this BS pandemic. Maybe you should lose weight. Weight contributes to both high blood pressure and asthma. </p>
<p>Also idk why you think healthy people under 35 are uncommon. They aren‚Äôt, though that might change with this vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>Anyways I even said in my comment that everyone should choose whether to take the vaccine based on their personal risk. As a healthy, fit, 20 something, I see no reason to take the vaccine. As an unhealthy person with multiple comorobidities, you might decide differently ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

<p>&rt;a 1% chance of dying isn't a chance any rational person should ever take.</p>
<p>I hope you realize how ridiculous you sound. If you're afraid of those odds you should never get in an automobile. Especially never in India, statistically much more dangerous than covid. </p>
<p>Also you're example isn't logically sound. You have a less than 1% chance of dying from covid, <em>if</em> you even contract it, and <em>if</em> you even believe the obviously pumped up stats. The actual likelihood of infection is different and if you understood statistics you would realize the legitimate odds of death are lower than the value of living life to the fullest, by far. But I suppose some of that is perspective. Isn't it funny how the term YOLO disappeared practically overnight? I hated it, but still. </p>
<p>Let go of your defeatist mentality. Seeking securiity will only bring you slavery. Until you realize that, you're going to be fighting with yourself. History does not favor your line of thinking, those who write the history books will be most pleased with your subservience though.</p>

        <p>Of course, Rabies is actually a deadly virus.  Vaccines can be useful when weighed against the risk versus reward.  I'm vaccinated against plenty of things, ones that were long tested and in human use.  I didn't get the HPV vaccine because for my circumstance it wasn't going to be very useful.  If they had an HIV vaccine, I wouldn't get it either because it's also irrelevant.</p>
<p>I got flu vaccines when I was in middle school because I was a hypochondriac, but then I realized they don't protect against "stomach flu" and that was what I was scared of, so I stopped.  Never had flu before, haven't had it after.</p>
<p>I think I should get a tetanus booster, but I had a bad reaction and know they would just give me a booster at the office if I am injured, anyhow.</p>
<p>The covid shot has a much higher report of adverse effects than any of those long used vaccines.  It's also marketed as basically changing nothing.</p>

<p>Calling people who oppose being forced to get one specific vaccine "anti-vax" is inaccurate, and it's propaganda meant to conflate any skepticism or criticism of any vaccine with the farthest extreme position to demonize that criticism. Don't buy into it.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I am definitely being manipulated by the government because I have a differing opinion and since you are the member of the 0.1% club you must be woke and the remaining 99.9% must be all sheeps brainwashed by the media, government and all the other institutions a like.</p>

<p>People wearing a seat belt can still die in a car crash. People wearing body armor can still get fatal injuries from a gunshot and die.
Face masks do not completely stop the transmission of the virus. People have died from adverse vaccine effects. What's your point?</p>
<p>&rt;And studies showing masks are ineffective</p>
<p>But it does not matter as long as the benefits outweigh the negatives. You know how many lives have been saved with vaccines compared to people dying from vaccines? Do you know how many potential transmission vectors have face-masks stopped compared to people dying from wearing them?</p>
<p>I'm not denying that vaccines may have killed people or caused health complications. AZ vaccine was suspended for these very same reasons. </p>
<p>&rt; When what I‚Äôm doing is backing up freedoms, rights</p>
<p>People not wanting to wear a face mask because "it's uncomfortable" compared to putting others around you at risk? Imagine some dude refusing to wash his hands and you contracting rabies because of it. You can exercise your freedoms and rights as long as you don't harm others around you.</p>

        <p>Yes I definitely would because rabies is fatal. The difference is the covid shots are still in phase 3 clinical trials and have not been FDA approved yet.  I am not an anti-vaxxer but the covid shots have not passed the clinical trial phase.  We ARE the trial.  I am not willing to be a test subject for something that has over 99% survival rate for my demographic and I just so happen to have a anaphylactic allergy to (an ingredient in the current covid shots).</p>

        <p>im anti covid vaccine, not anti vaccine in general</p>
<p>I have been vaccinated for pretty much every "mandatory" vaccine in my country to the age i am now ... why??? because these went through rigorous unrushed, careful, testing, years and years of it.</p>
<p>covid vaccines have been rushed, and the reports of extreme negative side effects are just too much to me and the negatives outweigh the positives at the moment, considering covid is 99.8 % SURVIVAL RATE</p>

        <p>My biggest thing beyond the lack of long term testing, is how hard they are pushing it....when EVER has a place (CA right now) been offering people a chance to be one of 10 people getting 1.5 million dollars to get vaccinated, and a slew of 50k prizes....but we can't combat the general needs of the public? But we are in a deficit? Seems fucking crazy to me. And it makes me nervous. I've literally never been an anti vaccine person. But this one is just a little off, everything about it</p>

        <p>For the last time, this is not a "vaccine". It does not meet the legal definition of it.</p>
<p>If this were a vaccine, I might consider it. It's not. It's a medical treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. David Warner does a great job of breaking all this down. This is why the government can't make the shot mandatory because it is legally NOT a vaccine.</p>

        <p>A lot of people here don't understand rabies. Rabies is only 99% fatal if it reaches your brain. Until then you have no symptoms. It takes an average of a few weeks to a few months for it to reach your brain. During this time a person who knows what they're doing can fight off the virus naturally. You can do this through prolonged fasting and a healthy diet:</p>

<p>So no I wouldn't get the rabies vaccine. However I wouldn't begrudge other people if they had need and got it. There's no evidence I'm aware of that the rabies vaccine is dangerous. However the covid "vaccine" is experimental and untested, and is undeniably having side effects on people including sudden death.</p>

        <p>I know right? It was a huge shock when I learned I had been lied to all my life regarding health from doctors, the government, and official health organizations. Good health can be obtained for free, but they don't want you to know that because then you are no longer dependent on the system and drugs.</p>

        <p>after hearing there are adverse reactions, i am not going to volunteer to take it, so i might be anti-covid vaccine in that sense. on the other hand, i'm in the US military so i have to follow DoD guidelines if they mandate the vaccine. i can't really fight it.</p>
<p>but right now, it's still "voluntary" for us to take it. i have never seen the DoD do this for any vaccine in the past 18 years. it is really strange that we are given a choice for this, when i have about a page and a half worth of other vaccines/shots i've had to go through during my time in service, to include smallpox and anthrax.</p>
<p>i am guessing it's not mandated yet because they don't want to be financially responsible for covering adverse reactions of a vaccine forced upon us.</p>

        <p>Im not anti-vaccine, Ive had vaccines in my lifetime, but all of those vaccines were done between the ages of me being 0-16, and whilst I was at school or to small to even remember them. </p>
<p>Were we given all the information on what the vaccines were for at the time? And what the risks were if we didnt have a vaccine? No, and I most likely wouldnt have understood anyway at those ages. I cant even remember if my parents had to sign a consent for the ones to be done at school, thats a very distant memory! I just knew you had to be vaccinated because if you caught whatever disease they were vaccinating you against, then you would be seriously seriously ill or even die.</p>
<p>During my adult life Ive not needed or had to take vaccines for anything, and with the covid vaccines Ive been able to make an informed choice NOT to have one on the information thats available to the public.</p>
<p>I dont really know the risks or rabies or what the outcome is for most if you catch it, I need to do my own research, but if I were provided with all the information I need when a vaccine is offered, I would weigh up my personal risk then decide from there whether it would be appropriate for me to take it.</p>
