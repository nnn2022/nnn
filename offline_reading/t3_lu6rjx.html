    <strong>Does anyone think the world has changed?</strong>
    <p><p>I feel there was a paradigm shift around the mid 2000s in how society operates. Like maybe around 05-07 ish. Hard to explain, but the best way I could describe is, it feels like a different planet from what I remember. Yeah we have horrible pop culture, a toxic political clusterfuck, the gap between the poor and rich is wider, people are more depressed etc but there's something much deeper going on. We are being watched. There is no privacy anymore.</p>
<p>Everything feels so unbalanced, its like a clown world where chaos runs free 24/7. Society is a cesspool of zombie biological androids incapable of basic critical thinking skills or social interaction. Maybe it was the phones, idk.. But none of this ends well in my opinion.</p></p>
