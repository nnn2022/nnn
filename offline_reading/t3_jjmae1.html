        <p>Putting aside, for 1 second, that still no one has been able to make the CONTROLLAVIRUS meet the Koch's postulates (therefore it's existence has not been proven yet), there are three details which make the its existence even more suspicious:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Viruses are known for spreading from an epicenter outwards, slowly.</strong> This controllavirus, in just a matter of weeks traveled to the other side of the world (from China to NY/Europe) and we are told that it created havoc everywhere in the European and American continent in just matter of days. However, Asia was barely impacted by the virus. Take the case of Taiwan, which shares direct connection to Wuhan, it only reported 7 deaths. Or the case of South Korea, China's neighbor with huge interests in the country (Samsung's factories, for example), this country only reported 460 covid deaths. No virus in recorded history did this ever or behave like this at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Viruses are born adapted to the conditions of their place of origin, the temperature, the flora and fauna, etc. They are part of the ecosystem.</strong> As virus spread from their epicenter, they lose strength, because they can't adapt to new conditions that quickly. However, this controllavirus was killing people in the winter freezing temperatures of NY and Canada, but at the same time was killing people in Brazil in summer (with over 38 degrees Celsius or 100 degrees Fahrenheit in average). No virus in recorded history EVER behave like this. It contradicts everything we know about viruses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only the controllavirus traveled to the other side of the world rapidly, without any type of temperature/condition barrier, but <strong>it also created a massive and coordinated attack in most of the European and American countries right at the same time</strong>. No virus ever did this!... Maybe this controllavirus communicates itself via satellite and coordinates it's global offensives, right?... Like now, when all of the sudden cases are arising exactly in the same places as last time and all at the same time. That satellite must be state of the art.</p>
</li>

        <p>&rt; , why South Korea has only 460 covid deaths, when its connected by road, train, boat and plane to China?</p>
<p>Its a good question and my answer is that I don't know. Maybe we'll figure it out in a few years from now. There has been a substantial amount of speculation as to why this is (e.g. existing mask culture) but no concrete answers yet.   </p>
<p>&rt; Use your logic, I'm sure you have one somewhere.</p>
<p>You seem to be under the impression that you're pursuing logical conclusions and everyone else is not. I fear you are awfully mistaken. Remember that everybody's mind lies to itself which is why we use the scientific method to try to create repeatable experiments and compare with each other to attempt to eradicate these personal biases. You seem to have a lot of faith in your own conclusions and I would encourage you to have less.</p>

        <p>what do you mean? My point is that your point about virus epicentres seems to completely ignore the advent of air travel. Air travel is one of the biggest factors in making the tracing and controlling the spread of the virus exceptionally difficult (along with asymptomatic cases).<br>
We have cases that have been somewhat documented of people flying around and spreading the virus from China to far flung places such as Europe. One of the biggest spreading outcomes was a fellow that went to a conference in Singapore that some infected people from China attended, he went then to Austria and spread the virus further (he was asymptomatic). This case study (along with presumed others) is what spread the virus to Italy and other European nations.</p>

        <p>Finally you have an argument. I see your argument and it's logical. <strong>However, you ignore the point that viruses depend on the local conditions to spread.</strong> <strong>Viruses are part of an ecosystem.</strong> A virus which is born in a tropical jungle, does not survive in the freezing Canadian temperatures in winter. </p>
<p><strong>That is why when people travel to another country, they usually get sick.</strong> When they travel to a different country, they are exposed to the viruses from that region, viruses they never faced before. <strong>Different regions, different viruses.</strong> Viruses are adapted to the conditions where they come from. And yes, viruses can mutate and adapt in time, but that take years to happen. All the controllavirus HOAX unfolded in a matter of weeks in the whole planet. Ridiculous. </p>
<p>What I find super funny is that <strong>you literally propose that a virus can spread in four different continents, all at the same time, without any type of conditional barrier, just because of air travel</strong>. When, again, the cases of the neighboring countries to China refute that premise in this case. <strong>Taiwan only reported 7 covid deaths.</strong></p>

        <p>&rt; A virus which is born in a tropical jungle, does not survive in the freezing Canadian temperatures in winter.</p>
<p>This isn't necessarily true. While some viruses have a particular efficacy based on climate it is not known if COVID-19 actually does or not (i.e. some explanations as to why Africa is less impacted might be based on climate) but the principal point I'd like to make is that <em>it isn't guaranteed that a virus needs a particular climate</em>. The only thing it really needs is a host.  </p>
<p>I.E. it's perfectly plausible to catch the flu "out of season", its just much less likely. This would then suggest that climate impacts the efficacy of transmission as opposed to being some sort of binary condition that makes it somehow unable to spread. <br>
It might be that the virus has transmission factors that make its transmission much more effective to the point where climate differences are negligible in its ability to spread. For example it might live longer on surfaces (e.g. 9 days versus 2) to such an extent that seasonal factors that might reduce the amount of time the virus can easily live on a surface become less relevant (for illustrative purposes lets imagine this is minus 2 days during summer).</p>
<p>&rt; What I find super funny is that you literally propose that a virus can spread in four different continents, all at the same time, without any type of conditional barrier, just because of air travel.</p>
<p>What makes it funny? It makes it technically possible. Are you still attempting to defend your position that viruses <strong>have</strong> to spread slowly from an epicentre? I don't think that's true given the modern world.</p>
<p>&rt; When, again, the cases of the neighboring countries to China refute that premise in this case. Taiwan only reported 7 covid deaths.</p>
<p>Sure, there's evidently more factors at play than we're accounting for. There's already been considerable speculation on the reasons that S.Korea and Japan have seemingly escaped the worst but that doesn't discount the very palpable theory that the virus spread quickly via air-travel.</p>

        <p>What you wrote is so wrong that it refutes itself. I just wonder where do you get the inspiration to write that much crap.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm going to say (which is frankly ridiculous that I need to explain this) is that <strong>for a virus to go from a host to another host, it needs to travel through the air or the saliva, or whatever.</strong> In the moment that the virus comes out of the host's body, it is exposed to the local conditions. Seems like you don't know the properties of moving.</p>
<p>Unless you think that people go around touching each other's internal organs. Or that the virus teletransports from host to host. Or maybe you think that the virus particles have some kind of astronaut suit to travel.</p>
<p><strong>Get your ideas straight buddy.</strong></p>

<p>Aye and the question is: </p>
<p>&rt; what impact does the temperature of that air have on transmission rates?  </p>
<p>You appear to be under the assumption it changes it from 100% to 0% out of season. I am arguing its more complex than that (e.g. somewhere between 0 and 100%). Furthermore I am arguing that there might be something so virulent about this virus that the climate impact is much less relevant to its transmission.  </p>
<p>Please tell me at least that you appreciate that flu can be transmitted "out of season".   </p>
<p>Like I said before you'd be much more credible if you were less certain about what it is that you say. I feel like you talk in much more certain terms about this subject than a qualified virologist would. I am going to assume that you are not qualified as a virologist?</p>

        <p>I thought this was a sub for reasonable and concerned people that believe the coronavirus exists and that some measures should be taken to try reduce the scope of it's possible negative impacts, but that the recurring lockdowns and the mass panic and hysteria amped up by the media are not the right way to do this and causing more harm than good or necessary.</p>
<p>&rt;Viruses are known for spreading from an epicenter outwards, slowly.</p>
<p>Not necessarily. All it takes is one infected and contagious person (that may or may not know they're infected or contagious) to take a flight to the other side of the world for the virus to have a new "epicenter".</p>
