    <strong>My experience in an emergency room during Covid was horrible.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been a lurker here but I’ve never posted anything. I live in California. I work at a large airport as a gate agent. I was laid off by one airline and hired by another. I’ve personally felt the affects of covid but I’ve been lucky enough to get another job. </p>
<p>I play softball. During one of our “illegal” practices, I tore my ACL. I called my husband, he took me to the emergency room. I was in so much pain. We got there and he carried me from the parking lot into the ER. Of course we didn’t think to put masks on, we were freaking out. We got in there and the woman at the desk didn’t say anything about masks, we went into this small room where a nurse took my vitals and everything, she didn’t say anything either. After that they still needed a few minutes so I sat in the waiting room. One of the workers eventually said we need masks so my husband went out to the truck to get them. </p>
<p>The woman in the waiting room was horrible. After my husband left she said “shouldn’t you be wearing a mask?” and I told her “Maybe, but shouldn’t you be minding your business?” and we went back and forth until my husband came back. I whispered it to him when he sat down and he told her to not speak to me like that, which made things worse. Eventually she kept harassing us and asked for us to be removed until I was called back. </p>
<p>This was a week ago and I’ve had my surgery. I’m recovering and doing well. People like her are why I’m with you guys on Covid. It’s scary how people can turn against fellow citizens over something this small.</p></p>

        <p>Perfect example of why the conflict created by masks <em>is in and of itself an argument against masking</em>. Masks are the apple of discord. There must have been literally <em>millions</em> of unpleasant confrontations like this. It just isn't worth it. Speedy recovery.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you went through that. I got in a fight with a mask Nazi yesterday and it wasn't fun.</p>
<p>The problem is that many of these people really do believe that by not wearing a mask, you're putting others in danger. Of course, we know that's bullshit, but from their perspective, why wouldn't they confront you? Since you're not going to change their mind, I'm not sure what the solution is other than minimal engagement. In my post about my encounter, u/Mrbubbleswantsmilk suggested responding with a simple, "Oh." Maybe take it a step further and don't say anything; pretend they don't exist. Don't put fuel on the fire.</p>
<p>Glad to hear the surgery went well. Keep up the good fight.</p>

        <p>A simple "I don't wear a mask" with a smile and then going about your business while they simmer with rage is enough.</p>
<p>Although I can totally relate to the urge to fight back, I learned the hard way that retaliation = they win. As soon as you retaliate, they get to place you in the "Karen" box and you lose, no matter how shitty they were originally to bait you.</p>

<p>I had to go through this "shouldn't you be wearing a mask" bs everyday as a receptionist at my dad's company until I started standing up for myself and telling off a few coworkers as they walked in.  </p>
<p>I realized how to beat them, I had to be the one that confronts them, not wait for them to verbally assault me.  Right when I see that "glare" they get when they see me not wearing a muzzle, I'm already telling them to fuck off.  Works at my job, works when I'm shopping, works anywhere I go.</p>

        <p>the surgeon wanted to do it a week later. he said it’s normally a week and a half after injury but he did it at around a week and 2 days. i say “a week” but it’s been a bit more than that. i thought it was a little early but whatever.</p>

        <p>Yes 1-2 weeks is about normal for an ACL. They wait a bit to let the swelling go down some. Otherwise they could operate the same day if they wanted to. A lot of fracture repairs are same day or next day.</p>

        <p>Granted it has been about 8 years since I had mine done, but <em>then</em> it was important to build back as much muscle as reasonably possible before the surgery.  Also, if it's an allograft surgery you need to wait for the donor.  That's why I asked what kind of surgery you had, something from your own body or that of another.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope whatever surgery you had went well.  And sorry to say, but the real pain starts with physical therapy.  At least that's how it was for me.</p>

        <p>Sorry you had to go through that OP, tearing your ACL on top of all this new abnormal bullshit.</p>
<p>Your encounter with a Maskstapo trainee kinda reminds me of a couple of months ago when my dad cut his hand open with his hedge clippers.</p>
<p>After I finally convinced him to go to the hospital after bleeding into the kitchen sink for 45 minutes, my mom and brother were scurrying around the house for essentials; you know, keys, phones, masks. I'm sitting there thinking "Really? <strong>That's</strong> what you're concerning yourself with right now?!" It's not like they would have even been penalized for not wearing them.</p>
