    <strong>My Brother is a Complete Doomer and I'm fed up.</strong>
    <p><p>For context, my brother lives in Ontario right now. That province has managed to whip up a massive fear campaign mainly over the variants and hospitalizations. They haphazardly decided last minute to go into ANOTHER lockdown, shut down schools, BAN live streaming which is completely insane, and just a bunch of really shitty half measures. Obviously Canada is a really worrisome place to be right now and the government has been very successful in scaring a lot of people. However, even with that ALOT of people in Ontario are fed up with this BS. </p>
<p>My brother is an interesting character and I really feel like he is only a Doomer because of his circumstances. He used to work at a very high paying corporate job and his current partner also has a good paying professional career. Then about 7 years ago he came down with all sorts of weird chronic illnesses. I think 3 years ago he quit his corporate job due stress and managing all his symptoms. Basically now, he has been purely focused on solving his health problems, living off of his massive savings for the last few years, while his partner is also now working from home supporting them. They live in a very nice apartment downtown and never have to worry about paying the bills. I feel like because my brother has only been living in a reality where he is a "sick" individual at the mercy of health crises trying to solve them and get better is why he can't really let go of the COVID narrative. His first and foremost fear in life is getting ill.  </p>
<p>So he calls me yesterday being like,"I need to warn you about the variants and if you could just do two things for me, wear a mask and social distance cause its 'coming for you'" I had just gotten home from my job at that point, tired, and had a busy night planned. I just got so angry. I said to him I am fed up because my whole life I am forced to think about virus avoidance and COVID already. Now even you are ramming down the same bullshit talking points. I went on an hour long journey of trying to convince him of all the obvious conflicting information, how living in a sick society is more so that cause of this sickness than not isolating yourself, and how I have a right to take risks and live my life as a free person. He didn't want to hear any evidence I had. My brother is a HIGHLY intelligent individual but completely stubborn so he is the worst person to argue with because he always is able to find a talking point to argue against. I think a small part of him is so relieved that he can continue to stay at home, only focus on his health, and not try to find a new career or passion and finally be validated for all his neurotic tendencies towards health anxiety. At the end of our call he was like ,"I am glad I could tell you these things, I feel better." All I could tell him was I feel much worse, that he is more like a stranger to me than a brother now, and that I don't really feel like talking to him anymore. I didn't feel like he came from a place of empathy, i feel like he came from a place of fear, and I am done playing that bullshit game.   </p>
<p>Finished my rant. Not even sure where to go from here. Maybe I just slowly cut contact from my family. Its just so emotionally difficult as I've already cut contact with my parents as much as possible and I am breaking up with my partner of 4 years now too. Honestly this year has really shown me how fucking neurotic and anxiety ridden my family is. Its funny they always did think I was the messed up one.</p></p>

<p>This insight explains most of the utter insanity that still exists. The virus is an eternal and self-perpetuating excuse for stagnation and failure. </p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, the downvote to upvote ratios on all the Ontario fear propaganda videos on YouTube were about as lopsided as I have ever seen, over 5 to 1.</p>

        <p>Having health issues can really mess with people's head. Sorry to hear about your problems. If it was me I would just kindly say I disagree and disengage any negative conversations with him. Its not like you live together or something. </p>
<p>I get why people were scared at first but it's been a year they should not be freaking out at this point. I understood your frustration.</p>

        <p>Taking a step back is definitely a good idea. </p>
<p>From your rant, I can see the conflict between four risk models: the objective (i.e. the actual chances to get the virus, the actual chance to become ill from it, to become hospitalized, to require intensive care and to suffer from long term health issues or die), the fearmongering model the government and media are propagating, your brother's risk model (i.e. what risk he is willing to accept) and your model. Apparently there is so little overlap, that no argument can gain any traction, because there is no common ground. </p>
<p>If you want to reconcile these perceptions, you need to jump rope between three levels of communication: the actual arguments, the meta level and the emotional level, but that will take a lot of energy and comes with a 50/50 chance at best of actually dissolving the conflict. An alternative would to shut the discussion of an just nod, smile and ignore any demands from the side of your family.</p>

        <p>I had a UK friend who is extremely unhealthy. He's borderline diabetic, which he did to himself. The pandemic hit and he was constantly screaming online about how the UK needs to lockdown harder and mandate masks. He's a smart and funny dude, so he would also post all the "nothing makes sense" memes going around. It was a mindfuck as his friend. Do you think this is serious or do you think it's funny that nothing makes sense? I thought he was starting to calm down right around the time there was the Capitol "attack" in the US, but then this mf shared somebody's rant that stated "Americans don't have rights, they have privileges". And that's when I ended the friendship. Enough is enough. Why does he care what America does anyway? Apparently he wants the whole world in compliance and under government control. </p>
<p>I'm sorry about your brother. I currently have one brother who woke up years ago and he's a joy to talk to now, but the rest of my siblings don't seem to care one way or the other. I guess they think ignorance and compliance will make it go away. I had to block my Mom early on. She has mental issues and is a nasty individual overall. She called me in April to tell me the Chinese released the virus on us. I told her I was more worried about a rushed, forced vaccine and she started making fun of me, so I hung up and blocked. I'm honestly dreading my yearly visit this year. I think I'll keep my headphones handy in case she starts up. I only go to see my Gramma, otherwise I wouldn't bother.</p>

        <p>people change, not all friendships last forever. if someone gets indoctrinated into the cult of leftism, they're not longer the same person they were, they're now in that cult, and the only thing to do is to cut all contact and find new friends.</p>
<p>leftism is an extremist cult, make no question about it. these people can't function normally in society, and must be cut off.</p>

<p><em>But but...  The incubation period!</em></p>
<p>It is annoying as fuck.</p>
<p>He's so busy at his job he has no time to check anything out.  I send him links and information, and in fairness he's too busy to look at them, or even care.  </p>
<p>But then he'll give some tired Doomer talking point, as if that's completely credible.  I explain to him how ridiculous that sounds and why.  He just looks at me and says,</p>

        <p>Thanks for empathizing. It really seems lke they are not open to evidence outside the narrative. Im thinking of asking my brother to send me all his studies and read them just so I can show him I am open to trying to understand his perspective, even though I am very sure I will remain unconvinced. I feel so tired and frustrated with my loved ones. They don't realize how much I am mentally suffering from the measures.</p>
<p>The hardest thing I am learning how to cope with is the disillusionment. The people I thought I understand and intimately knew are no longer. They have a warped mindset and prespective to life that I clearly have no relation to. I have always felt very alone in this life and my brother was usually one of the few people that understood. But even now he is swept up in the fear. How can we learn to let go of these familial bonds that are clearly toxic?</p>

        <p>Yes, I feel the same way.</p>
<p>I don't know the answer.  I've lost many, many friends over this.  </p>
<p>At first, I was sad.  But as this drags on, I'm starting to feel like 'if you are still supporting this, I don't want to be your friend'.</p>
<p>Harder with family of course.  I won't lie, it has driven a massive wedge between my brother and me.  We've now had several nights of basically yelling at each other.  These days, we're both trying to avoid the subject to avoid fighting, but that doesn't work because there's nothing else to talk about.  So we just end up fighting about it again.</p>
<p>I wish I had something better to say, but at this moment I have no idea. Stay strong, and know you are not alone.</p>

        <p>There have been times when I've had to draw a line in the sand with certain people and say, "Look, I refuse to discuss this particular subject any more. Please don't take it personally; it's not just with you, but with anybody. For the sake of my own sanity I have to draw that line, and ask that you respect it. We can talk about anything else--and I'd love to! But not this." </p>
<p>Make it clear that this isn't about them, but rather your own needs. Don't defend your decision, or argue its merits--"I don't want to talk about this" is all the reason you need.</p>
<p>And then comes the hard part: you have to follow through.</p>
<p>Any time you declare a boundary, and want it respected, you have to enforce it. And if you want the relationship to continue, you have to be firm, yet gentle--withdraw politely and do not argue with them or respond to provocation. Give them a cooling-off period before engaging with them again in a positive way on some innocuous, neutral topic. Repeat as necessary. </p>
<p>I live in the US, and between Covid fuckery, last summer's protests, and the presidential election, I've had to tell a lot of people I care about which conversations I am unwilling to have, and which rants I am unwilling to listen to--and make it stick. I've lost a few of those relationships, but most have survived, even if some aren't as easy and open as they used to be.</p>

        <p>You shouldn't let arguments in politics get in the way of your relationship with your brother. I think you made the mistake of telling him you were upset by what he said, you could have just lied to him. He is clearly in a lot of stress from the looks of it, that is why he called you. It is too hard for him to tell you about the true stressor (his health) so he instead talked about the coronavirus. If I were you I would have supported him regardless of what he thought about the coronavirus, because that is what family is for.</p>
<p>It's sad to see families break up when there was really no conflict/struggle that warrants it. That's why I hate how Facebook turned into a place to isolate yourself due to political beliefs when it was meant to be a place to bring family and friends closer together.</p>

        <p>my family are doomers and they respect my different opinions, and I respect theirs. I dont waste time arguing with them because I know they watch different news and they've just been lied to.</p>
<p>if your family doesn't respect your opinions, they're not your family. tell them to go fuck themselves and never talk to them again.</p>
<p>if you're the one who doesn't respect their opinions, that's on you though. not everyone has the same life experience, knowledge and watches the same news. you can't expect the average person to act reasonably when everyone is lying to them 24/7. </p>
<p>obviously I dont respect the opinion of the average redditor or person I dont know, but family members get a pass. if they respect my opinions, I'll respect theirs.</p>

        <p>My nuclear family are all doomers.</p>
<p>Right or wrong, I don't care.. I send them 4-10 NNN memes every day and once in a while send an article.</p>
<p>I don't care if they don't read it. I've already told them I don't need them in my life and there's nothing I believe in more than covid being overhyped political communist bs.</p>
<p>The reason I send them stuff constantly is so they don't even dare try changing my mind.</p>
<p>Fuck em. Play hardball. I may make a thread about this for others who are depressed.</p>

        <p>That's a really awful situation. You've been honest, which is all you can really do. Just tell him that you don't want to hear about all this fear anymore, especially not from him, and I guess just be honest that you want distance is all I can say? However, you mentioned that he is stubborn. I am too, and if he's anything like me he won't be able to admit he's wrong or at least that you aren't. However, when given time and space he might realise, especially given that you won't be really talking to him and the inconsistencies of the narrative are very hard to ignore once pointed out. Of course, I could be wrong here, but I will say that just because he's stubborn doesn't mean nothing you said got through to him.</p>
