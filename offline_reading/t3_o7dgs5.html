    <strong>Seeing a lot of stories saying “the right”, religious people, and those who have low education are the ones who are not getting the Covid vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>Now, I’m not on the right (or the left), I’m not religious, and I’ve got an AA. I like the idea that we can wait for something to happen to us if we don’t get the vaccine- cause I believe in taking my chances because of my lifestyle and background. I like not telling people what to do, and I don’t get enraged when someone’s opinion differed with mine. How many people like me are part of this equation?</p></p>

        <p>Same. I never got a degree, but I attended a fantastic amount of schooling before a life event got in the way. But I'm not political or religious whatsoever. Insofar as I don't subscribe to any specific party or faith. I'm open to spirituality and I judge every politician equally for who they are, party lines aside. Stoned ramble lol. </p>
<p>But yeah I'm right there with ya. My friend, "Chip" is educated, atheist, and makes over 100k/year. Apolitical as anyone. He sees through it. </p>
<p>This is nothing but a smear campaign, and it means that our side has solid footing.</p>

        <p>I don't consider myself right or left, in fact I'm sick of all the "divide &amp; conquer" propaganda from all corners of the world. 
If I had to pick, I'd say I'm "libertarian", whereby I leave you alone, and I hope you will leave me alone. I never want to impose my will onto others, nor would I want my rights &amp; freedoms trampled on. </p>
<p>As for being religious, I'd say I'm more "spiritual", meaning that I search for the truth on my own, as this is my own life path. </p>
<p>I do have a very good education, so I'm not sure why the pro-vax side is saying we're dumb or uneducated.</p>

        <p>It's because their science is bullshit and anyone with a brain can see through it.</p>
<p>Anyone with a history background or history interest can see that whats happening sets us in a dangerous course.</p>
<p>But they want everyone to ignore that and believe otherwise, so they call us stupid and uneducated and make the proles feel good about blindly trusting them or ignoring their instincts.</p>

        <p>Your second statement is the whole reason im on this sub. Covid is real, lab or nature, and has killed people. Absolutely. </p>
<p>However, what is truly scary is the amount of control the governments and "experts" can take with just a sprinkle of fear. Especially when it's this "invisible enemy" that only they can save you from. </p>
<p>I truly am terrified for the future. Covid is only the beginning in my own opinion. And I really hope im wrong.</p>

        <p>Just a smear campaign. 
Judging by the quality of the writing and even the correct use of grammar in the posts on this sub, you can tell that most people here are decently-educated and aren’t total derps.
People not getting the vaccine care about their bodies and the people around them, unlike the typical covidiots who were ecstatic for free Krispy Kremes. 
But what the hell does my low-educated ass know? (I have an honours BA from a Canadian university. :) )</p>

        <p>When the left can't win an argument their go-to tactic has always been to name call.  For example, have a differing opinion on the jab, and present facts to support your opinion, then you are an uneducated hick.  Disagree with the lefts global warming schick, then you are anti-science or a climate denier.  Have a different thought about racism or affirmative action, well then you are obviously racist. </p>
<p>It's a tried and true tactic designed to shut down honest debate by making the hick, racist, or climate denier have to defend themselves against the charge. Particularly effective when done in the presence of others.  After all, no one wants those things said about themselves so the subject is now changed as the racist now tries to explain that he's not a racist. The more insidious result of this tactic is a lot of otherwise good people just avoid subjects entirely.  It's also how snotty leftists self righteously excuse themselves from the conversation.  Why should they waste time on obviously bad people.  </p>
<p>Don't belive me?  Try to reason, by way of fact, with a die hard leftist about any of their golden cow issues and watch what happens.  It's so predictable.  First they'll mount the standard MSM/NY Times defense. A well reasoned response will immediately frustrate them. Second they'll attack your source. Then when you counter with a source they'd typically accept as legitimate, say the CDC, they call you a lier and say you've misquoted the statistic.  Finally, when cornered with reason and fact, they start name calling.  The idea is to shut down debate by way of shaming someone into defending themselves against the charge.</p>
<p>The thing I've always wondered about is....are these people really this stupid, or just willfully oblivious to facts.  In some ways  I think they're to cowardly to ever admit being wrong....doing so would mean losing an argument to someone they feel is inferior.  That's too much of an ego killer for the ever so arrogant left.</p>

        <p>Thanks for all the comments letting me know I’m not alone. I know people with my kind of thinking are out there- and though this can be an outlet- I still feel like we are being silenced or painted as the bad guy. Stay strong y’all, and be vigilant. </p>
<p>We are still few, apparently.</p>
