    <strong>Covid only affected western countries but not overpopulated Asian countries next to China?</strong>
    <p><p>Why does it seem to be people are only dieing from western countries like USA and UK, with lower population density than  overpopulated poor countries next to China like India and Bangladesh? 
There's a 100k farmers protesting everyday for the past 3 months and we don't here about everyone dieing there? There is less masks and sanitizers use in those poorer over populated countries in Asia and Africa but somehow the virus only seems to be affecting the western countries on the opposite side of the world to China...</p>
<p>There's 167 flu cases in America but 400k hospitalizations last year and 0 in UK  this winter and you expect me to belive flu has been wiped out from mask use? 99% are using a cloth or a surgicall mask which doesn't even stop the spread.. why did we not introduce masks before and save lives? Why don't we ban smoking because of  lung related issues and leading causes of deaths worldwide? Oh wait big pharma are making a business out of vax and cancer meds which doesn't treat you and you need to be dependant on them for the rest if your life..</p>
<p>This is a complete psyop and worse manipulation from the gov will come in the future since how gullible people thinking they want to help them</p></p>

        <p>Around 15000 people were dying in India every day for a month, it is very likely the number is even more than that</p>
