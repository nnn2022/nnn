    <strong>In my last week of school (March 9-13)...</strong>
    <p><p>.No one wore a mask</p>
<p>.No one was "jittery" around each other</p>
<p>.No one seemed nervous or out of the ordinary</p>
<p>.Hardly anyone even talked about the coronavirus, not even teachers</p>
<p>.No staff members were even alluding to the idea of hand-washing</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What was your last week of school like? (if you're still in school)</p></p>

        <p>Was in March, nobody was worried about the virus, the teachers said they might shut down the school. Then out of nowhere we are told not to come in.</p>
<p>The same people who are no sharing fear porn on instagram and making posts along the line of "just because you want a beach day doesn't mean that the pandemic is over. Wear a fucking mask etc'. Were complaining about how everyone was panicking over nothing.</p>

        <p>Similar here (just graduated high school), but there were announcements on the loudspeaker about how the school was wiping down the doorknobs and that there were “hand washing stations” everywhere (just tables with hand sanitizer on them lol)</p>

        <p>The Last week their was talk about extending spring break and maybe pushing junior prom . We even had the principal assure us seniors we would be back for graduation . I’m in California and we got the SAh order very early so on that day we where allowed to leave if we felt so after first period me and my friends left to go fishing and fuckung around like boys do . Never did I think that that was the last time I would walk those halls a student . Tbh I was a shit student and I hated school and just did the bear minimum and slept all day especially during senior year , but god do I miss it now and regret my lack of trying and where it put me back in life . I hated school but god will I miss all the fun shit .  Anyone in school still PLEASE enjoy your time , be grateful to your teachers , but don’t let school life destroy your social life too . It’s an amazing time and I hope this covid shit doesn’t steal it from y’all. </p>
<p>Sorry for non covid related rant</p>

        <p>Same with my school. No one took it seriously and whenever someone coughed/sneezed, people would go "corona!" as a joke. Some people were talking about the possibility of school being closed but I thought it was a rumor until I got out of the blue, I got a phone call that said that school would be closed for "just two weeks."</p>

        <p>Basically the same.   I think only one teacher seemed concerned since he’s actually at risk but no one was scared or distancing but whenever someone would sneeze they’d joke it was the virus.</p>
