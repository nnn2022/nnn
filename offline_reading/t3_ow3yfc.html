    <strong>Universities in Canada considering Vaccine Mandate. What do?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, members of NNN. I'm in a rut and trying to get as much perspective as possible.</p>
<p>The gist: Universities accross Canada are currently considering/being pressured (often by students and faculty) to instate a vaccine mandate for Fall 2021. I currently attend the University of Ottawa, which has already mandated innoculation for students in residence and athletes, but has also stated that a return-to-campus mandate is on the table for discussion as the newest "wave" develops.</p>
<p>I'll be frank; I'm anxious as all hell and have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm operating under the assumption that it's going to happen, given that it's been suggested and met with little to no opposition from the student body (far as I can tell). I'm trying to come up with as many contingency plans as I can (just the type of person I am, I always cover all grounds). </p>
<p>Personally, I don't want to take this vaccine for two reasons: lack of necessity and political opposition. I am not in any risk group. My chance of being hospitalised is less than 1%, chance of death less than 0.05% and that's just going by the official figures for ages 39 and below. As for my political protest, it's simply that I understand how things like this go: a precedent is set for the violation of personal liberties, and it gets worse with time and I don't want to contribute to this becoming normal (which it never was and never will be, unlike what our detractors routinely claim).</p>
<p>At the same time, I really don't want to drop out of University. I like my program, I want to finish it. I have high sunken costs, and the one thing my parents ask of me is that I finish college. Last thing I want is to alienate my family (any more than I already have by refusing to get the vaccine). </p>
<p>I hate that my freedom to choose is being taken away from me. Though I don't share in the feelings of some on this sub that the vaccine is particularly dangerous, I would still rather take my chances with the virus (assuming I haven't caught it already) and would much prefer the immunity aquired through natural infection. The rhetoric being spewed against us is also wholly repugnant and I hate that our opposition of spineless ninnies and busybodies is in complete control of the institutions that matter.</p>
<p>Please tell me what you think someone in my situation should do. Even if you don't wish to give a prescription, I encourage you to post your thoughts below, especially to fellow young Canadians on here. Many thanks in advance for your time.</p></p>

        <p>Sue them for a violation of the Nuremberg Code, because you cannot be given informed consent, because they can't adequately describe the risk, because it hasn't been around long enough to define the risk. </p>
<p>If you are under 30, it is nearly impossible to prove that the benefit of the vaccine statistically outweighs the risk.  And to coerce you is an absolute violation of the Nuremberg code.</p>
<p>You don't actually have to sue them, you probably just have to threaten it, and they will figure out a way to not force you, because they would rather keep coercing people into getting it, and making you go away happy is the best way for that to happen.</p>

        <p>Will definitely look into some kind of legal action/exemption for this ridiculous measure, should it come to pass.</p>
<p>I'm not too confident (from ignorance, mind you) about being able to persuade an entity like a University to back down but I will definitely keep this in mind as a possibility.</p>

        <p>Gotta love the University dropping this on us right after most students have finished enrolling and are getting ready to come back. </p>
<p>I will consider this. Would certainly alienate my family but I guess they would take it slightly better than if I were to drop out. </p>
<p>I'll be missing sleep for the next three weeks easy. Fuck me.</p>

        <p>I would keep postponing until this whole nonsense backfires (which it will) and then you can complete your education “vaccine” free. Nothing wrong with working, making money, and getting experience in the mean time.</p>

        <p>Accept and come to peace with the reality that you will never get the vaccine, no matter what happens.</p>
<p>This has given me a lot of peace. I might have to drop out and lose my scholarship, hell we might not be able to buy food eventually, but I’m trusting the Lord will provide and the right choice is to skip the Culling Shot. There’s far too much evidence that this is a depopulation/ sterilization scheme, and we need fertile people to keep our species alive.</p>

        <p>I suggest you install telegram.ajd join the group Covid 19 Vaccine Injuries and take a look there at the vaxx injuries atrocities. Just go look...see how many people have so many paralyses, blood (I mean blood rashes) infected wounds in their skin, blood cloths etc etc. You won't believe. </p>
<p>I think you need your health beyond anything else. 
Who is going to pay for your hospital bills, rent, food if you get injured from this vaccine? Nobody. Nobody will care. </p>
<p>So...please make the right decision.</p>

        <p>Wait until they release official policy. Until there is an official policy, these are threats and fear mongering. It's still early in the jab game, we still have to wait and see how they manage the existing round and booster roll out this fall. Christmas is a loooooong way away. And that would only be 1 missed semester...</p>
<p>Once there is a policy, there will need to be exceptions in there. Find out about those. For example, at <a href="https://students.wlu.ca/virtual/assets/resources/fall-2021-faq.html#residence">Laurier</a> (See below; I don't know about UOttawa) has exceptions (tho hush hush, but they are there and there is that line that says you cant know anyone else' status that should hint at exceptions).</p>
<p>Don't provide any information about taking the jab or not until you receive concrete facts. Once there are facts, figure out what to do then. Until there are facts, it's pure speculation and anxiety inducing. Accept the worst and think about that outcome, but until there are facts it's better not to speculate.</p>
<p>If a jab mandate is put into force and there is no alternative, what will you do? You can wait it out, build a business in the meantime, wait for a part of the world that's got better prospects and go study there. You have options. It's not as great and linear as you may have planned for, and your family/friends may not be happy in the short term, but that's life and the people who love you will come around -- it is a crazy time for all. You have only have one life and you are never out of options. No matter what happens, you will be ok.</p>

<p><strong>Are there exceptions to the mandatory vaccines?</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;</p>
<p>Students in residence who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons or other grounds protected under the Ontario Human Rights Code will be able to submit a request for accommodation.

<p><strong>What is the process to request an exemption?</strong><br>

<p>The application process is being developed and information will be sent directly to students who want to live in residence.</p>
<p><strong>How will students confirm their vaccination status?</strong></p>
<p>Students will be asked to complete a form, attesting whether they have received their vaccination(s).</p>
<p><strong>Can I find out if my roommate has been vaccinated?</strong></p>
<p>The university will not be able to share this information with students.</p>
