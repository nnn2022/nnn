        <p>I hate adding comments that don't further the conversation but... this is spot on.</p>
<p>The sad thing is how we warn people just to end up criticized and ridiculed... and then when what we warned about comes true -- time and time again -- they never apologize or even remember their rude and abusive prior conversation.</p>
<p>If there's anything this situation has given me, it's a litmus test for showing people's true colors. I guess the powers that be wanted this kind of division, but it caused me to see that a lot of friends and family members aren't the kind of people I want in my life.</p>
<p>There are certain basic freedoms that are natural, they aren't given by governments and they aren't the government's to take away. When someone comes down on the wrong side of this argument and then vilifies me as the "extremist", complete with the typical dehumanizing namecalling they do... I'm kind of done with them.</p>
<p>I'd rather have a shorter list of better people in my life than a wide list of fascists and authoritarians. But that's just me.</p>

        <p>I like your point about basic freedoms. I believe most people don't realize that concept. For example, the Bill of Rights isn't a government document that gives some powers to the citizens. It's a declaration that these are the rights that the <em>government isn't allowed to remove</em>. An old piece of paper is one of the few things standing between the average person and absolute tyranny.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. It's heartening to hear another person that understands this.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that what you just said isn't taught in schools anymore. They dropped education like that, and teaching critical thinking skills, in favor of teaching conformity and compliance. It's a big part of how we ended up where we are today.</p>
<p>And... it was intentional. The more dumbed down the masses are, the less money concentrated wealth has to spend to manipulate them. In the end, "voting" doesn't matter if you can easily sway people to believe whatever you want them to believe.</p>
<p>At that point it just becomes a ritual for people to go through, to make them think they have a say in the government that rules over them. After all, a slave works harder for you if you trick them into thinking they are free.</p>

<p>Oh boy, oh yes. Even complete strangers. You talk three sentences and you know <em>everything</em>.  <br>
And immediate relatives. But most of them did reflect on what happens and we accept each other choices. That's the difference between us and the rest I know.</p>
<p>The other problem is that where I live, these basic freedoms were harmed, but then we were able doing most of our business. Like having parties right now while they have curfews. So for our state we can't say we were harmed the same way the rest of Europe is. The problem: Next time we adjust to that new baseline and what they have now we will get then - just the while <em>they</em> have it even worse around us. cf WWI and WWII...</p>

        <p>I really don't understand, since when did "conspiracy theorist" become a derogatory title? Used to be everyone knew a goofy <em>government is out to get us</em> guy but we all got drunk together anyways and shared bizarre thoughts about life.</p>
<p>Now anything that runs contrary to the norm is a conspiracy.</p>
<p><em>Clearly</em> there's a fucking conspiracy at foot here.</p>

        <p>I couldn't agree more. We OGs have been vilified and crucified for all the above. Even now as things are so painfully obvious it can seem like an uphill battle. Yet, there are a ton of people waking up from the illusion. So that gives me hope. Stay true to yourself. Don't back down. And stay grounded. Shits getting more real day by day.</p>
