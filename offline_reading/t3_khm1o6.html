        <p>I so feel this</p>
<p>I am Immunocomprimised, complications from the Flu nearly took me out in 2018.  I have never made anyone wear a mask for me.  Not even when I was going through Chemo to kill off my immune system...all while I was taking public Transit to and from Chemo.  Autoimmune Diseases/Disorders suck and are not a reason to restrict your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>My Doctor specially said there is no need for me to wear a mask or do anything different from my normal life.  The only change I made was working less, no more 6 day work weeks.    </p>
<p>I don't need You to do anything for me to make me safe, other than what You normally do.  <br>
I have adapted and live my life as I choose and I expect you to do the same.  </p>
<p>When a common cold can cause you death you stop fearing a lot of things.  I learned how important it is to LIVE YOUR LIFE. I know how much time I have left and I will not let the Government tell me how to live what little time is left!</p>

        <p>Yes! I am not "at risk" since I'm young and healthy, but I have a naturally weak immune system and I always have. I often get sick 6-10 times a year and I'm not joking. And yeah, it really sucks. And yeah, I get sick bad a lot of times. After a few months of being healthy, I usually think "well, it's about time I got sick again." </p>
<p>But I could never imagine asking someone to go out of their way to do <em>anything</em> for me just so I have a less chance of getting sick. I would never ask a sick person to wear a muzzle for me, let alone a healthy person. I would never ask a sick person to stand far away from me, let alone a healthy person. I would never treat someone with fear and paranoia just because they "might have it."</p>
<p>The truth is, getting sick sucks. But it's a part of life. Even if getting sick would kill me for sure, I'd never tell someone what to do just to give me .00000000000001 percent less chance, if that, of getting sick. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your post. You hear so often "Oh my God, don't you know I'm immunocompromised????? How dare you come close to me, how dare you not wear a muzzle, how dare you see friends?! (And if you actually do those things for them, they're like "Okay, all cool now.") Stop talking about your rights, what about MY rights? By not going to these extreme lengths just for me, your taking away my right to live!!!!!!! Don't you understand that? God, some people!" </p>
<p>They can't speak for everyone and you are proof of that. Thank you so much for not being entitled like so many people.</p>

        <p>I have a chronic illness that manifests in various systems including immune, nerve and muscle.</p>
<p>The government refuses to acknowledge that it exists here in Ontario, though they have convened 3 task forces to "study it and make recommendations" over 30 years. And research is ongoing in small amounts in other countries.</p>
<p>Research suggests that my condition could worsen with age, to the point of being unable to work, if I am not careful. </p>
<p>I am the only person responsible for my health. The government doesn't really care, or even know what my life is like. I take risks every day, and feel awful a few days a month.  I have the freedom to choose where I live, what I eat, and how I want to live. If the government takes any of those freedoms away from me, my health will suffer.</p>
<p>Other individuals occasionally do cause harm to me, but it's done by accident in ignorance and I would never take their freedoms away. In fact, it is against all precedents and disability law here for other people to have to change to accomodate my illness.</p>
<p>My health is fundamentally my own responsibility. The choice of what risks to take and what mitigative actions to take, are, and should always be, my own.</p>

<p>One would think if a Mask was recommended my Doctors would have said something while I was going through Chemotherapy.  Funny how I never had to wear any PPE and the nurses had to wear a lot of it just to give me my drugs, aka Poison.</p>

        <p>no, i’m saying the argument “i’m not asking anyone to do anything means i’m not selfish” is stupid. i used the drunk driver analogy because it had already been brought up. because by your logic, however “in the wrong” a drunk driver may be, they’re not being selfish because theyre not asking anyone to do anything. you could make the exact same argument as this meme with “loudly talking on your phone in a movie isnt selfish, the other audience members are for asking you to stop” or “a kid who refuses to share any toys isnt selfish, their parents and teachers are”</p>

        <p>Driving when drunk is proven to be highly dangerous. COVID, by the WHO's own estimate, has a mortality rate equivalent to the flu. Not driving when your drunk prevents drunk driving accidents.

Per the article you linked to prove that COVID is the leading cause of death in the US, it is listed as the third leading cause, behind heart disease and malignant neoplasms. But then, if you were capable of rading beyond the heading, you wouldn't be a doomer, would you?</p>
<p>Now, let me give you <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">the actual CDC figures</a> on COVID deaths. I quote directly:</p>
<p>&rt; For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned </p>
<p>Now, when you look at the comorbidities, it really gets fun. Did you know about 10,000 of them were comorbid with "intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events". COVID didn't kill those people, they died in car accidents, or from drug overdoses etc. But when the rule is that it gets listed as a cause of death if the person tested positive any time in the 28 days prior to dying, that's what you get. Now some of the 94% of "COVID deaths" comorbid with something else probably were caused by COVID, but a whole heap weren't. So is it really the third-leading cause of death in the US? Nope. </p>
<p>And if I get infected (pretty certain I already have been, but that's neither here nor there), it's staggeringly unlikely I'll end up in the ICU. As a healthy man in my 30s, I'm far more likely to wind up in the ICU as a result of driving to the shops than I am if I actually catch COVID, which is itself not especially likely.</p>
<p>So as a rational person (who can handle basic hygiene just fine thanks. I know some of you had to be reminded that handwashing existed at the beginning of this, but most of us have had it down since early childhood), I'm going to look at the actual level of risk here and take the actually responsible decision, the one that doesn't involve shutting down society and hiding in the basement with my hoarded toilet paper.</p>

        <p>&rt; Are you really that dumb? Per the article you linked to prove that COVID is the leading cause of death in the US it is listed as the third leading cause</p>
<p>Are <em>you</em> really that dumb that you can't read the entirety of a one-page article?  From the article:</p>
<p><em>Especially for older adults, the threat from COVID-19 may be even greater, for 3 reasons. First, the Table presents the aggregate 8-month mortality rate for COVID-19, not the current mortality rate, which has been increasing rapidly. <strong>Between November 1, 2020, and December 13, 2020, the 7-day moving average for daily COVID-19 deaths tripled, from 826 to 2430 deaths per day</strong>, and if this trend is unabated will soon surpass the daily rate observed at the height of the spring surge (2856 deaths per day on April 21, 2020).6 As occurred in the spring, <strong>COVID-19 has become the leading cause of death in the United States (daily mortality rates for heart disease and cancer, which for decades have been the 2 leading causes of death, are approximately 1700 and 1600 deaths per day, respectively4).</strong></em></p>
<p>Furthermore, you previously claimed that the virus had a mortality equivalent to the flu. This is also a huge lie. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20201218/covid-19-is-far-more-lethal-damaging-than-flu-data-shows#1">COVID is far more lethal than the flu.</a></p>
<p><em>Researchers analyzed U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs data on more than 3,600 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between Feb. 1 and June 17 of this year, and more than 12,600 hospitalized with the flu between Jan. 1, 2017 and Dec. 31, 2019. The average age of patients in both groups was 69. The death rate among COVID-19 patients was 18.5%, while it was 5.3% for those with the flu. <strong>Those with COVID were nearly five times more likely to die than flu patients, according to the study published online Dec. 15 in the BMJ.</strong></em> </p>
<p>&rt; And if I get infected (pretty certain I already have been, but that's neither here nor there), it's staggeringly unlikely I'll end up in the ICU. As a healthy man in my 30s, I'm far more likely to wind up in the ICU as a result of driving to the shops than I am if I actually catch COVID, which is itself not especially likely.</p>
<p>It's clear you care only about yourself, and not the other people that you could potentially infect, so consider this:  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/24/strokes-coronavirus-young-patients/">COVID can cause strokes in people your age.</a> Do you want to live the rest of your live with the debilitating effects of a serious brain injury? Should the rest of us have to bear the cost of your federal disability payments because you couldn't be bothered to wear a mask when you go to the supermarket?</p>

        <p>&rt;It's clear you care only about yourself, and not the other people that you could potentially infect, so consider this: COVID can cause strokes in people your age.

<p>Why do you keep pedaling that largely anecdotal article from April with almost no followups in the months since?  All that article is, is a few doctors claiming that their young patients who had covid mysteriously had strokes.  First of all, this doesn't prove that these patients' strokes can even definitively be attributed to covid; and second of all, a few patients suffering from this phenomenon doesn't "prove" in any way that covid "causes" strokes in young people, particularlyon any significant scale (that headline was very bad journalism, and very alarmist).  And third, should the rest of us have to bear the EXTREMELY detrimental effects on our lives from the dystopian lockdown measures, along with all of the massive bailouts and stimulus due to lockdowns (since you'reso worried aboutcost), because you're afraid of the VERY unlikely possibility of getting a stroke from covid?  Moreover, we don't shut down our entire way of life based on unlikely possibilities, no matter how dire the consequences.  I don't want a brain injury any more than I want to be paralyzed, but I don't stop driving.</p>
<p>It's pretty telling btw that there are no followups to this article.  Yet another alarmist panic piece that got no attention after they stopped allowing anything and everything be published after the beginning of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Smoking is not actually allowed in hospitals, yes. <em>Because other people can inhale the smoke and get sick</em>.  Go figure, right?</p>
<p><em>Monsters who can't accept and internalize the concept of personal responsibility are the problem</em>, because everyone else understands and accepts that they don't live in a hermetically sealed bubble.</p>
<p>If you don't like your living situation, <em>take some fucking personal responsibility and change it</em>, don't expect the rest of society to take care of it <em>for you.</em></p>

        <p>&rt;I know reading and understanding written content that's longer than a bumper sticker is hard, so I'll quote the article for you: </p>
<p>Your Quote does not say what you think it does.  Deaths WITH COVID are not Deaths FROM COVID.</p>
<p>Over 75% of all deaths WITH COVID are in people with 3 or more Cormorbidities.<br>
You are free to keep ignoring that only about 6% of deaths are actually FROM COVID19.</p>
<p>Locally out of all the COVID deaths only 10 have been in Healthy people who were mostly in thier 90's.  Everyone else was already sick with multiple issues.  </p>
<p>&rt; This is the problem with the pro-plague crowd. They actually don't understand and can't internalize the concept of personal responsibility: </p>
<p>This is no Plague.  You clearly do not understand personal responsibility.</p>
<p>&rt; They hate staying at home because they can't take personal responsibility for their own living conditions and providing themselves housing that they enjoy. </p>
<p>No Need to stay home if one does not want to.  If it is safe to go to Walmart it is safe enough to go to a small local store or service provider.   You are building a a strawman for you to blow down.  </p>
<p>&rt; They hate restaurant and salon closures because they feel entitled to the labor of other people and/or they're too lazy to provide those non-essential services for themselves and their families. </p>
<p>I can tell who you voted for.</p>
<p>You Hate Restaurant and Salon Owners and Workers who rely on their customers to run their businesses and provide for themselves and their families. You are just selfish and don't care about the suffering of others.  You don't care if they lose their business and their homes.  Sounds overly entitled of you.  </p>
<p>How many paycheques have you missed?  </p>
<p>&rt; They hate school closures because they have kids (that they also hate), and can't stand to be around them all the time because they're no doubt just as awful as their parents are. </p>
<p>You are the Hateful one here.  You are projecting your own hate on to others.</p>
<p>No need for school closures.  Children are not at risk nor are schools sources of transmission.<br>
Many parents can not afford to stay home and supervise their children.  They still need to work.  <br>
Sounds like you don't care about working families.  Must be nice to be so privileged. <br>
Do you even have kids?  I doubt it since it appears you have no clue what you are talking about.  Do you have any experience with online teaching in an Elementary, Junior or Senior High School?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; They hate wearing a mask even though they could be asymptomatic and infecting other people, potentially fatally, <em>wearing a mask hurts their feelings and makes them feel like "a pussy" as others have mentioned in this thread.</em> </p>
<p>Again you are projecting your own hate and bias.  Nice Strawman.  <br>
Asymptomatic Spread has been shown to not be a thing.  It has been proven not to be of any signifigance.  Why keep wearing something that has proven completely ineffective?  </p>
<p>Why do you feel you have the right to force others to dress as you command?  </p>
<p>Do you not believe in personal rights?  Would you force an Exmuslim Woman who has escaped oppression to cover up again?  Do you try to force disabled people who can't wear one to put one on?  </p>
<p>You have the right to wear one if you choose.  You have no right to force anyone else to wear one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Smoking is not actually allowed in hospitals, yes. <em>Because other people can inhale the smoke and get sick</em>. Go figure, right? </p>
<p>In Hospitals NO.  </p>
<p>Outside of Hospitals YES</p>
<p>Smokers are not denied Healthcare despite them doing something that has a high probability of causing future health problems.  </p>
<p>We are free to put our health at risk.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; <em>Monsters who can't accept and internalize the concept of personal responsibility are the problem</em>, because everyone else understands and accepts that they don't live in a hermetically sealed bubble. </p>
<p>You are the Monster who cares nothing for your fellow citizens.  You want to force them to bend the knee to your cultish beliefs.</p>
<p>Just becasue YOU think you have it right does not make it so.  You are responsible for you and you only.</p>
<p>You do not live in a Bubble either, you do not get to Violate other peoples rights just because you are scared of a disease.  Try Practicing personal responsibility and take care of yourself and your family.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If you don't like your living situation, <em>take some fucking personal responsibility and change it</em>, don't expect the rest of society to take care of it <em>for you.</em> </p>
<p>You are the one who is expecting the rest of society to take care of you, not me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am Immunocomprimised.  The Common Flu nearly took me out in 2018.<br>
I know how to take care of myself very well thank you and have been doing it for years.  I never needed you to do anything to protect me.  </p>
<p>I never wore a mask while doing Chemo and never made anyone wear one around me either.  I even took public transit when going through Chemo.  </p>
<p>When the common cold can cause Seizure, Stroke, Coma or Death one takes their Personal Responsibility for their own health very seriously.  One also accepts that life is not fair and there is nothing one can do to stop the spread of disease, it will spread.</p>
<p>I never expected society to change to protect me, I changed, I adapted. </p>
<p>Now useful idiots like yourself are the ones forcing the change on society with the excuse to protect people like me.  </p>
<p>So how about you accept personal responsibility for yourself and leave me and those like me out of it.  We know how to take care of ourselves better than  you ever could.</p>

<p>No, that is you building a strawman.</p>
<p>The Data has proven that the diease is not as deadly nor dangerous as we have been lead to believe.  China Lied.</p>
<p>&rt;If you care about people so much and want the pandemic to be over, get the vaccine. Wear a mask.</p>
<p>Masks have proven not work.  Why should people wear them when they do nothing? </p>
<p>If you want to get the Vaccine, get it.  If you get it then you don't have to worry about others who choose not to.  </p>
<p>Take personal responsiblity for yourself.  It's not anyone elses responibilty to take care of you or protect you from a disease.</p>
<p>You would force those who are medically exempt from wearing a mask and force them to wear one?  You would force your cultish beliefs on others?</p>

<p>1) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2#Sec3">Masks haven been proven to work</a>.</p>
<p>&rt; We identified seasonal human coronaviruses, influenza viruses and rhinoviruses in exhaled breath and coughs of children and adults with acute respiratory illness. Surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of influenza virus RNA in respiratory droplets and coronavirus RNA in aerosols, with a trend toward reduced detection of coronavirus RNA in respiratory droplets. Our results indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses and influenza viruses from symptomatic individuals.</p>

<p>Actually, that's exactly what it's about. Case and point: The people that are so mad that they're "stuck at home" can't take the personal responsibility for their own living conditions.  They're not mad they "can't go out", they're mad that they haven't made the effort in live to live in a space they actually enjoy.</p>
<p>And regardless of the disease, do you want somebody with a deadly, infectious contagion getting that contagion all over everything? Do you want someone with AIDS to cut their fingers and then pick up random packages of meat at the supermarket? Putting on a bandaid "infringes on their freedom", so they should definitely just go out in public and get their blood on everything, right?</p>

<p>As per usual, projection from the pro-plague crowd.  Nobody that has money and a decent place to live is complaining about the lockdowns or wearing a mask. All the complaining is coming from entitled, unemployable losers that want to blame the government for their failures in life instead of taking a little bit of personal responsibility and enacting real change for themselves.</p>

<p>Nobody's forcing you to stay at home. If you put in the effort to get yourself a decent job, you've got money, which means you've got options. But it seems pretty clear that doesn't apply to most of the people here. All I hear is hollow bitching and moaning from people who want everything in their life to change without getting off their ass to make it happen.</p>

        <p>&rt;You're not under house arrest. Nobody in this country is. If you could stop lying about it to cover up the fact that you're financially irresponsible and just can't afford the things you want in life, that'd be great, thanks.</p>
<p>1) you're completely missing the point.  Just because I'm not being forced to stay home like an actual prisoner does not change the fact that you're full of shit when you say that it's not that bad to be inside one place 24/7 with no life.</p>
<p>2) you can keep acting like you somehow are better off than me, and I don't know you, but based on what I do and where I live, I'd be willing to bet a year's worth of pay (not a small amount) that i have a significantly better job than you, and a better house; and I can assure you I can afford nearly everything I want in life.  Thanks for your concern though.  Wish you well in dad's basement.</p>

        <p>So people just need to learn to live with staying at home?  Does that include those living with multiple generations in cramped apartments?  I guess they just need to make the effort to live in a space they actually enjoy.  Glad you like your room so much and don'tgo out.<br>
And once again you've changed the goalposts.  First you were telling people to suck it up and just put on a mask and wash their hands, now you're criticizing people for not staying home.  If you can't see how those things are different then I seriously pity you.</p>
<p>And if you think confining people to their homes and closing social institutions is no big deal, then you don't understand the Third Place principle.</p>

<p>I haven't changed the goalposts at all. Wearing a mask and following basic health guidelines is not incompatible in the slightest with acquiring a comfortable living situation. </p>
<p>Here's an idea: Take the vaccine, get a decent job, and rent an airbnb in Tulum. Or Costa Rica. Or Aruba. Or Bermuda. Or Hawaii. There are tons of places you can go, safely, unless you've been personally irresponsible and left yourself with no options in life.  </p>
<p><em>But if you have been irresponsible with your time, that's not anyone else's fault, is it?</em>  So stop blaming the government for your own failure.</p>

        <p>So you just post that it's the leading cause of death in the United States without mentioning the very specific demographics it kills (elderly with chronic conditions who will likely die soon anyhow)?  What you posted even says it's the 2nd leading cause of death for individuals 85 AND OLDER.  I'm curious as to whether you actually read the studies you post.
Once again, ignoring the specifics and treating it as if it's a grand killer across the board.</p>

<p>No, the issues are because of the deadly virus and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e1.htm">the people that are spreading it because they refuse to follow basic health guidance.</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Answer my question. You used the analogy of drunk driving but won’t stand up to it?</p>
<p>You're commenting on a meme image that makes the complaint that wearing a mask is somehow an onerous restriction, yet you just admitted that you wear one?</p>
<p>Do you stand by this statement in the post you're defending?: "I haven't asked one person to do one thing. YOUR list is LONG and endless." </p>
<p>Society has all kinds of rules. That's what makes it function. You can't drive drunk.  You can't drive 90MPH in a school zone. You can't drive on the wrong side of the road.  You can't bring a suitcase full of fireworks and a loaded gun onto an airplane. You can't smoke on an airplane. You can't smoke in a hospital. You can't shout "fire" in a crowded theater. </p>
<p>Do you agree with all these rules that are designed to keep everybody safe, or do you dismiss them as onerous restrictions on your "freedoms" as well? Do you even understand the concept that you don't live in a hermetically sealed bubble and the actions of others affect you, just as your actions affect others?</p>

<p>If everyone in this sub hates masks and lockdowns so much, why is there so much anti-vaccine content upvoted? Surely if everyone took a little <em>personal responsibility</em> and got the vaccine, we'd get the pandemic under control, right?</p>

        <p>That's the thing. The only people complaining about all this are entitled, unemployable losers that want to blame the government for their failures in life instead of taking a little bit of personal responsibility. </p>
<p>Here's an idea: get a decent job and rent an airbnb in Tulum. Or Costa Rica. Or Aruba. Or Bermuda. Or Hawaii. There are tons of places you can go, unless you've been personally irresponsible and left yourself with no options in life. </p>

<p>Yes, exactly. Nothing is problematic about taking basic precautions if a person is potentially infected. It's <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54487154">when they decide to attend a large social gathering</a> that the problem arises.</p>

        <p>No.  And we shouldn't even necessarily make seatbelts mandatory if it's just you driving, but if you're <em>in the back</em> as I said, then you can indeed become a projectile in a crash if you're not wearing your seatbelt, and can even kill the person in the front.  Which is why I find it interesting that so many people think a seatbelt isn't necessary in the back.</p>
<p>So I think you missed my point a bit; if you want to endanger yourself while driving then fine, but not the other people in the car.  Unless of course they're fine with the risk too; my only point was that a person <em>can</em> become a projectile, not necessarily me telling people what to do.</p>

        <p>In principle I agree with you.</p>
<p>You do have that right.  You want to put yourself at risk of catching a disease, all the power to you!!</p>
<p>I do not care if you do not wear your seatbelt for the most part.  </p>
<p>I do care since I live in an area with socialized healthcare(OMG it is not what you think it is) and I do care since it is my tax money that would pay for your hospital stay.  </p>
<p>From a Tax saving presepective I do have interest in you wearing your seatbelt since if there is an accident my tax money is on the line. </p>
<p>Also from an Insurance perspective which we all have to buy if we want to drive, you wearing your seatbelt also makes sense.  Less chance of injury and death(which means you keep paying your insurance).  And if there is an accident the smaller it is and less injury you have means rates do not go up as much for everyone else in the area.  Your one Accident could increase rates for the surrounding area if large enough.</p>

They don't want it taken away from them and virtue signaling about the need to protect others is a way to legitimate it.</p>

        <p>My friend got let go because his company needs crowds to operate. He's very pro lockdown. And he already got sick. So at the minimum of being unemployed for a year he effectively paid $50,000 to still get sick. So I hope he feels like his lost $50,000 is really helping the greater good and protecting mankind. If he loses that narrative he'd probably snap.</p>

<p>So yes, I would say putting your own comfort over saving people is very selfish. All the arguments listed in this post are old and stale and not even actual arguments. They are temper tantrums that snowflakes use because they want to feel special and get attention.</p>

        <p>If people had followed what the scientists said, including the government officials who did nothing to help, we could be opened back up like Australia. Australia has had 4 cases of COVID in the last week. In the United States we continuously lose people equal to 9/11 death count. Amazingly enough even though Australia is opened up most people are still wearing masks and following safety measures to ensure that they don’t catch it. </p>
<p>How astonishing, United States, supposedly the greatest country in the world. Yet the citizens are so unpatriotic that they would put their comfort over someones wellbeing. FREEDUMB BABYYYYY WOOWOOO MAGA 2020-2024-2028-2032! EMPEROR TRUMP!</p>

        <p>Because of course simply not getting wasted before driving causes people to lose their jobs or businesses and miss cancer screenings, and exacerbates their mental health issues.  To you, lockdown measures that are destroying peoples lives are a minor inconvenience equivalent to abstaining from going to a rager before driving. 🙄</p>
<p>I guess you're suggesting that it's now the new socially conscious thing to take unprecedented and dystopian measures in consideration of the few immunocompromised, unlike before March.  We were such unenlightened heathen in February.</p>

        <p>What "other people"? Fucking randoms at the grocery store? I DON'T CARE. THEIR HEALTH IS NOT MY CONCERN.</p>
<p>Judging by the number of muzzle wearers I see waddling around the streets who are disgustingly, offensively fat, these random ass people don't have much concern for their own health either. You know what the authorities would do if they actually wanted to take freedoms away to improve everyone's health? Smack the McRib sandwich out of fatty's hands and herd him and the other lardasses into the fucking gym. I'm so done with the mendacity of it all.</p>

        <p>Not force? So denying me entry to businesses if I don’t wear one isn’t force? Closing everything isn’t forcing me to stay home and stop living my life? Who knew. </p>
<p>It’s not my job to stop my life to keep others safe. They can choose for themselves how best to stay safe. </p>
<p>Let me ask, have you ever wondered how many people you’ve spread a disease to that killed someone down the chain? Did you find people being out and about maskless during flu seasons in years past abhorrent? I’m guessing not. The health of others didn’t just become my responsibility here in 2020 when it was not before, nothing has changed significantly from years past. Communicable diseases that target specific groups more than others have always been and will always be a thing and we have never before treated perfectly healthy humans like some sort of biohazard in the past like we are now. If others want to feel and be safe, that’s up to them, not me.</p>

        <p>Really? So stop driving because 36,096 Americans die from car crashes; stop eating trans fat because 1 American dies every 36 seconds from cardiovascular disease; stop spreading your nonsense because 123 Americans die from suicide everyday. Oh but you only care about covid related deaths. Got it.</p>

<p>Not in the grand scheme of things. We're you expecting a world in which that number would be 0?</p>
<p>Also these deaths aren't preventable, at least not in terms of centralized authority signing a few laws and magically making lowering the numbers. The preventative measutr lies with the individual who lives a healthy lifestyle. The proof of that is that there's no correlation between the numbers, and the strictness of the mandates.</p>

        <p>The only thing I have ever asked is that everyone wears a mask.  If you wear a mask, you are protecting me and I am wearing a mask for you.  I could care less if people get the vaccine.  With its effective rate, I won’t get sick.  So, if you choose not to get the vaccine that is fine by me.  Of course the vulnerable populations that can’t get vaccinated due to either allergy or health, immune compromised or recent transplant patient won’t be able to do things -as normal if we don’t get herd immunity.  But at this point, I just don’t care.  I’m so sick of wearing a mask to protect people who don’t care about me and only their rights.  I just want my shot and to get on with life.  I feel as soon as the vaccine is available for everyone that then if you didn’t get the shot that you were okay with the consequences of that choice.  But I literally don’t care anymore.  A mask isn’t stifling your oxygen, how do surgeons and operating room staff, nurses, doctors, respiratory therapist, etc.  All wear a mask for 12 plus hour and no one passes out.  But you cry because for 20 minutes on a grocery store or wherever you go indoors they ask you to cover your nose and mouth.  Cry me a freaking river, snowflake.</p>

        <p>If you're worried about this cold with 99.7% recovery,  stay home. If you're worried for others that you know, stay away from them.  Let everyone  else live normally and let the world carry on spinning. There are much deadlier diseases out there that have been around for quite some time, if you want to live with a mask for the rest of your life, that's your prerogative. </p>

        <p>And how many long-haulers are there?  The number matters, particularly when we're talking about an unprecedented and dystopian response to the phenomenon.</p>
<p>There are people of all ages paralyzed in car accidents who's lives will never return to normal.  Should we ban driving?  Of course not.  And that's because of how relatively few people that happens to, balanced with the potential effects of banning cars.</p>

        <p>Your logic is very strange.  I don’t have a number.  I don’t know if you have noticed that people only care about death numbers and recover numbers.  There are no numbers reporting lasting effects because we are all too busy hating each other.  I’m a snowflake to you and your a snowflake to me because I am right and you are right.  And there is literally no common sense in that maybe just maybe we both could be right on some and wrong on others.  Like I said.  Your thoughts on masks depend widely on your pain and suffering.  If it’s not affecting you health wise then it’s the economics and if it isn’t economically effecting you then it’s health wise effecting you.  I believe we are all being a bunch of idiots.  When we should be helping each other, we are literally throwing gasoline on one another.</p>

        <p>Back when he was a teenager, the late actor Bill Paxton caught strep throat. Even though it was treated, it worsened into rheumatic fever, which permanently damaged his heart. (By the way, that complication occurs in 3 out of every 10 strep infections.) When he was 60, he had surgery to correct the damage, and died from the resulting complications.</p>
<p>Even common infections that most of us have had can have lifelong health effects. COVID isn't some unique danger.  It's merely the newest.</p>

        <p>If the mask works as advertised it stops corona going in just as it stops corona coming out. My not wearing one has no bearing on how effective yours is.</p>
<p>You will not comply your freedoms back. That's not how it works. They're saying explicitly that taking the vaccine will not end the  ask mandates and the closures and the other bullshit. The only way out is through disobedience. Uncuck yourself.</p>

        <p>No, you are wrong.  Because we are both wrong.  We have each turned on our blinders and refuse to see each other as human beings with different needs and different life experiences, and stressors.  If you work healthcare you see only the worse cases.  If you’re a small business owner, you only see your hard work being taken from you.  It’s depends on whether the economic or the disease has been in front of you more.  Humans in general are selfish and need to have our basic needs met.  When they aren’t, we get loud and demand to be heard.  The thing is everyone is yelling and no one is stopping to think of the other’s person needs.  If I was suffering with the loss of income, uncertainty of my next meal, then I would obviously be louder as these are basics.  If you are seeing the destruction that this disease is causing on families everyday because you are surround in your bubble of disease, death, and despair due to loss of life you want everyone to follow these rules of masking, social distancing, and getting a vaccine.  If we stopped yelling we could maybe see the point the other is making.  I don’t want more death from any cause.  More death equals more pain and suffering which leads to more death.  It’s a vicious cycle.  I see that our government has let us down by not supporting us through a health crisis by not providing money to those who need it.  Instead they help the rich get richer and are fine with the poor and middle class becoming poorer.  As long as the rich is creating this hate, they are winning.  They took the most unpolitical thing and made it political.  You either right or left.  Virus is neither right nor left.  People can do amazing things but when faced with financial ruin.  It is easy to ignore anyone’s idea other than the one that helps you survive.  We are all here just trying to survive.  As long as we see each other as enemies the rich and powerful are winning because they play us both and we end up being the fools falling for it while our health, wellness, and freedom decreases.  I am so angry with everyone because we are letting the corporation’s win.  If we United they couldn’t stop us, that why they put us against each other.  Science can be found by anyone that wants it their way to be the right way.  It doesn’t make it good.  It’s just a never ending hamster wheel they have us on and I want off the ride.</p>

<p>Yeah, sounds about right. Fuck off back to /r/coronavirus, they have low enough standards for you to fit in over there.</p>

        <p>You're the one who has made up your mind and will not have it changed, even by reality.</p>
<p>Your echo chamber tells you that there is a high probability that you will die if you get covid, and that you will almost certainly get it if you live your life even halfway normally.</p>
<p>Your echo chamber also tells you that this is the only thing that matters, and that no matter how much destruction they may cause, that unprecedented dystopian measures are "worth it" to protect you from this monster.</p>

        <p>You can't get through to these doomers. They've made up their minds and nothing, not even reality will change it for them.</p>
<p>Leave them to their echo chamber, continue being safe until we can get the vaccine to make us feel safer, and move on.</p>
