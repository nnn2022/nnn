    <strong>Anyone else feeling unmotivated to socialize anymore? Anyone else lost friends because of COVID views?</strong>
    <p><p>Lately I've become increasingly unmotivated to hang out with friends. All of my friends except one (and my boyfriend) are vaxxed and are very much Branch Covidians now. All of them hardcore support masks, lockdowns, social distancing, vaccine passports etc. </p>
<p>I've felt the distance growing from them all since COVID began, and it's because I can't be my true authentic self with them. Between them all being "woke" and very leftist to being against medical freedom and pro-authority, I just don't know how/what to talk with them about anymore. I want to be honest, but I also don't have any room inside anymore to be attacked for simply thinking differently as a moderate Libertarian. I have accepted them, but I 100% know that they would all reject me because I'm different from the group. It's only a matter of time before that happens for good.  </p>
<p>Have any of you experienced this? Anyone feeling jaded or rejected by your friends?</p>
<p>I am true to myself and my beliefs, but damn it's a lonely road sometimes.</p></p>

        <p>Rural areas are easier if you want to do that and you still have access to most modern day conveniences. Essentially, save up, find land, buy it, talk to someone that actually grows crops &amp; livestock for a living and they'll basically just tell you how &amp; when to grow anything. Sell whatever excess you have locally to pay expenses.</p>
<p>Still playing the capitalism game for now, but definitely considering this option as a future possibility.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your comment. I completely agree with you! My goal is eventually get some land in a rural area to fully expand my mini homestead. I've been a prepper since 2013 so I've slowly been making my way towards the goal of getting land away from cities and people. In the meantime, I've been developing skills in the suburbs. I'm worried that I won't be able to get out in time though, and worried I won't have a reliable enough group to survive with if the end times come 😬.</p>

        <p>Same here! I've been a prepper since 2013 and I have taken a lot of survival and wilderness first aid courses, so I know how to survive initially if I went into the woods. Yet as of right now, I don't have any other people to support me currently. There's a balance of being super independent with relying on other human beings, and to be 100% not reliant on any other humans is incredibly hard/borderline impossible. It's not completely impossible, but it certainly isn't easy. It helps to at least have a partner on board.</p>

        <p>I lost some friends. A few good ones and I’m not gonna lie, it made me sad. But our friendships ran the course.  Being rejected or mocked because of my beliefs did hurt. Ultimately my time is precious and I need to spend it with people I can be myself with. And those aren’t the ones. I hope you find some like minded or open minded friends you have fun with. Take care of yourself out there.</p>

        <p>I agree with you! As a moderate Libertarian, I've watched my mostly leftist friends become so incredibly radicalized that they now believe if you don't agree with them completely, then you deserve to die. They actually believe that unless you are 100% in agreement with them on everything, then it must you must be against them. It's a growing problem all over the place, but it's one I don't want to deal with anymore. Hence my desire to move away from Seattle.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry. </p>
<p>I was led (by God; by fate, whatever you wanna say) to leave my liberal area and move to a conservative area in 2018. Had I not done that, I'd be very much in your boat. I cringe when I visit my old area and see how they have acted throughout all of this.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I'm hoping to move to a more conservative area soon (thinking of Eastern Washington, Idaho, or Montana currently). </p>
<p>Though I'm a Libertarian, I've recently learned that conservatives are more accepting of people other than liberals/leftists. </p>
<p>Plus as a 2A supporter and guns owner, I definitely don't want my guns taken away. I did my class and paid for my concealed carry certification, so people need to leave me the f*ck alone now. </p>
<p>Honestly so much of politics is solved by being left the f*ck alone.</p>

        <p>The problem with Eastern WA is you are still under Inslee's thumb. Went to Montana this summer and it's like none of this exists there. Stay away from the college towns and you should be golden.</p>

        <p>Yes. I’d say 3/4 of my classmates have their shots taken and proudly paraded them on Instagram. I can't help but to sigh and shake my head as I realize that they’re sheep. There’s like 1 or 2 people I know from my class that haven’t given in, and of course myself. </p>
<p>But in general, I've said it before, 90% of people are robots. They do as commanded. And I said that at the beginning of this shit. I was going through a grocery store when I literally said out loud to my dad "I tell you. 90% of the people in this store are robots. They can’t think. They just do as told.". The worst part is no one around me even batted an eye as they heard me. They just ignored it. Invalid command, I guess. Maybe my syntax wasn't right for their SmartBrain ™️ to register it...</p>
<p>But if anything, I’m the one pushing those people away. Having been alone most of my life, I feel no alienation. But I’m just disappointed in them.</p>

        <p>My experience has been that I am more scared. Even within the places I go, I don't feel like I can truly open up because there are rabid fanatics. I never really had friends-most of who I would consider friends are overseas. I have to keep my views quiet.</p>
<p>I have cut back on my going out places or where I go just because I can't mask. I can only wear a shield-and I have been denied service places for it, because there is no such thing as a medical exemption here in Seattle. Even if I could mask I wouldn't though, I see right through a lot of this.</p>
<p>I had people yell at me for not staying home all day at the beginning...I have one life to live and I will beach it, like it or not.</p>

        <p>I 100% support you! As someone in the hard-of- hearing community, masks really hurt my social engagement because I could no longer lip read, and it REALLY stressed me out from there. </p>
<p>It definitely added to my social isolation, along with not being woke because Seattle is super woke so you're supposed to follow that established narrative or else 🤣🤣🤣. </p>
<p>I had a mask on once saying I was hard-of-hearing and a "wokey" said I was just being an ass and making something out of nothing because of my privilege. </p>
<p>Dude...I literally have in my medical record that I am missing hearing frequencies. Doesn't matter if I'm Libertarian or not. It doesn't matter anything when it comes down to me being hard-of-hearing and struggling with it. </p>
<p>This is what led me to No New Normal. You all accepted people when no one else wouldn't.</p>

        <p>I had a customer come in back in March and she was also in the hard of hearing community. Just got implants but relied on reading lips. Seeing me in the face shield...she started crying because she could understand me. I know places elsewhere had signs that said "No Mask? We Won't Ask!" </p>
<p>I'm noticing my lack of woke-ness is impacting me. I am scared to go out a bit. I have no friends. To be honest I am thinking it's gonna be beers in the park by myself before too much longer as the list of places with vax requirements grows.</p>

        <p>It's strange. A year ago, I would have thought that being reviled and disrespected because my views are different form the majority would be one of the worst parts. But much worse than getting disrespected by people's stupid posts on social media is the slow realisation that  <em>I</em> am losing respect for <em>them</em>. I want to think well of my fellow humans but it's getting harder.</p>
<p>I'm still fighting for it though. When I lose all hope in them I try to at least keep some compassion. I can see the divide and conquer operation that's being waged against the people, and I have to do my part not to let it get a hold of my mind, not to let it leave me hollowed out and jaded, surrendering to the inevitability that friends become enemies and humanity is lost.</p>
<p>It's hard though. It's exhausting.</p>

        <p>You summarized my feelings well too! I have lost respect for them all. Not because of their personal choices per se, but because they have never questioned the narrative, they then virtue signal hardcore, and then feel the need to demonize people who don't follow the narrative. </p>
<p>Hell I got in trouble last Spring (2020) just for pointing out that there's a viral research lab in Wuhan, and <em>just maybe</em> there could have been a leak of some sort. </p>
<p>Suddenly I was a white supremacist and TRUMP SUPPORTER 🤣. I have nothing against Asians or Chinese people (several of my closest friends are Asian), I just hate the CCP and communism, but I guess that comment made me a white supremacist 🤷‍♀️. </p>
<p>I do not respect people who blindly do what they are told without question, especially if they then demonize people who don't follow the herd just because they do. </p>
<p>It's tough because my former respect for my friends still keeps me hooked, yet I know in a way they are no longer worthy of being respected anymore. </p>
<p>A fancy college education and cushy tech job doesn't make someone better than anyone else. Being a better boardgame player doesn't mean that person is smarter either. </p>
<p>I'm honestly in a toxic relationship with these people that will not end well and I know it. I want to break free and am working on it, but that means accepting being pretty alone for the future.</p>

My mom has been pressuring nonstop, dont talk to my brother, people ignore me who used to be good friends with me or call me an anti vaxxer, if we try to go out to do something like go to a restaurant or walk on the beach its seen we like we are doing something wrong and think at first was feeling depressed about it but instead my brother in law and I started going to the gym, eating healthier, just got a house not too long ago and been spending time working on garden, spending more time with son and wifes homeschooling him, started getting into vintage pc gaming and started playing lord of the rings online.

        <p>Yeah, some of my friends started to flip out pro vax propaganda memes or were trying to get me to approve of case where a single dad with 3 kids got fired for not being vaccinated. Gave them the benefit of the doubt, said I was against anything that breaks worker's rights and they should be too. Changed the subject to "we should just play some cards against humanity or whatever". Evening went ok after, but if they keep doing this I'm going to just ditch them and tell them it's because they're acting like assholes and I feel like we don't really share the same values anymore. Definitely felt like I'd be immediately rejected if I took up the opposite views, which is why I decided to shift the conversation towards doing something fun.</p>
<p>These are friends I've known for 5 years or more so it's kinda messed up what the propaganda is doing.</p>
<p>Anyway my point is don't be afraid to change topic and if all they wanna do is shit on others then ditch them and tell them you don't want to put up with this unhealthy obsession over witch hunting. This Covid shit isn't going to go on forever and people will eventually forget about it and whether you kept your friends or not they'll be opportunities to meet more. Keep the bf, he's an alright lad.</p>

        <p>I appreciate and value your input! I'm someone who usually values live and let live. I won't start stuff, but I'll certainly finish it if necessary. Shifting the conversation to something else is a good tactic and one I'm going to try and implement if I end up hanging out with my Brach Covidians friends in the future.</p>

        <p>I feel ya. It is hard to hang out with people who you feel you have to censor yourself around, it drains so much energy.</p>
<p>And if you choose not to censor well then it just becomes a debate and I'm sick of debating with people over "facts" or "numbers."</p>

        <p>I haven’t outright lost any, but I stay away from the dumber ones anymore. They’ll gather at house parties with 20 people without a mask in sight and blame the world’s problems on the guys who don’t wear a mask into the convenience store while they shopped for 2 minutes</p>

        <p>Yeah I’ve been kind of on the side of your friends. Not pro authority in the case of new laws and respect the freedoms of small business owners and people who want to opt out of the vaccine. However, the people I knew that wanted to prove some weird point by not masking up and believing bullshit articles that deny science for the sake of controversy really made me uncomfortable. I didn’t want to associate with them as much when they started sounding like flat earthers.</p>

        <p>I get what you are saying. Lots of bullshit being spouted on either side.</p>
<p>With that said, how are you differentiating between what articles are bullshit and which ones are not?</p>
<p>For example, in my country masks are still mandatory, for everyone. Because, you know, apparently they are needed for something. Wierdly enough, the WHO itself has long admitted that there hasnt been a single case of asymptomatic spread recorded (as of today). Meaning, everyone who has no symptoms (like I do now) but wears a mask, in order not to spread a respiratory virus, is basically denying science. Also means, everyone who recommends masks to asymptomatic persons is cueless on the matter.</p>
<p>In fact, masks, lockdowns, vaccines, all of it couldve all been avoided by a simple rule: "If you are feeling ill, stay home!"</p>
<p>Yet, I kinda doubt you would call all the media / politicians / health authority, who called for and are still calling for them, the same as you do with "us". If a Fauci calls for masks for everyone he is denying science and whatever he says to prove his point (other than actual studies proving his point (which are not-existent!)) is bs. Same goes for anyone else who recommends them for asymptomatic people. Those are the flat-earthers and science-deniers, when it comes to this topic.</p>
