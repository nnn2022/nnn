    <strong>OPINION: r/nonewnormalban should be banned for promoting brigading</strong>
    <p><p>Check title. The sub r/nonewnormalban promotes the brigading and public harassment of the fair users on this sub. It encourages people whose stance on the covid vax experiment isn‚Äôt pro choice to come here and vent their bottled up hatred towards those less compliant than them. Don‚Äôt believe me? Read what they‚Äôre all about. It‚Äôs a direct counter to NNN and only exists to wipe it and its free thinking participants off the face of the internet, akin to the banning of T_D. </p>
<p>Everyone here who is still active, I implore you. Visit the sub and report it, report everything. But do not stoop to their level and leave unkind words. I‚Äôm convinced that the very existence of NNNB is against Reddit‚Äôs terms of service and frankly, promotes toxicity. Ok thanks for reading</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôm dismayed by how true this is. I‚Äôve seen people comparing the approach people have with ‚Äúanti vaxxers‚Äù to that of the brown coats from Nazi Germany. At first I thought it was pishposh but now the resemblance is uncanny. Free speech is dying and folks like this are burying it in its grave</p>

        <p>Excatly like that. I'm a German and to compare the Cov vaccine propaganda and its effect on society with Nazi methodology is absolutely correct.  At this time already, nothing to be considered nonsensical anymore. That's excatly how they did it. Same psychology. Declaring one group of people as the reason for the bad state of the economy, as the instigators of the sociatal turmoil, characterised as selfish, unpatriotic and outright depraved and then dehumanising them as an infectious pathogen, as vermin, dirty, undesirables, outcasts, who are responsible for your ills, who will according to an incremental increase of discriminatory legislations gradually banned from participation in society. Marked as to be immediately recognised in public life as such, and prohibited full citizenship and its partaking in  essential services. Arrested, put in Ghettos, declined essential health services, and finally terminated.</p>

        <p>Yup we are on your side. We have an algorithm in training that will work to prevent brigading by detecting certain content. Like when someone says y'all are antivax and should die, our bot is learning to recognize crap like that. Us mods are sick of you folks getting treated unfairly. </p>
<p>The algorithms are only a week old so they still have a lot of training to do. But feel free to send me a direct message if you want to send a post or comment my way that shouldn't be on this sub. </p>
<p>Of course there are other moderators here that care just as much and would happily handle any reported content. But if you see something on this subreddit that shouldn't be here, just know that I do not mind at all if you send me a a direct message about it. I'm one of the people here that help program the bot. And I can quickly had any reported content into the algorithm to help it learn.</p>

        <p>You're right on all accounts.  But the powers that be would die spitting blood before considering even the consideration of that. There are some among them who want us killed for resisting this long. I know because I egged them on to see what they'd say. In the end some of them probably figure a mass culling of the unvacinated/non-compliant in the millions inevitably citing planet sustainability as a reason</p>

        <p>A mass culling will happen to the vaccinated first, not the unvaxxed. Remember that the numbers on vaccine death collateral are under reported, and have been since the vax came out. Honestly there‚Äôs not one person on this planet who can accurately tell you what will happen to the vaxxed in 3 or even 2 years. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs all a rouse, and the only real epidemic is the heavy misinformation about the safety/efficacy of the mRNA vaccine from the media. Remember Dr Robert Malone? Yeah neither do I, he was deleted from wikipedia and most mainstream sources on the Internet. Look him up, read up on his input on the covid vax, and make your own decisions. The world is becoming upside down and it‚Äôs left to us, those who are aware to figure it all out</p>

        <p>Disinformation*. When you're wrong it's misinformation, when they're blatantly lying, it's disinformation. Don't use their words.  Not sure why they'd want to kill their sheep off, leaving a pack if wolves for them to contend with. I want to think mRNA will be the greatest medical innovation of all time, but probably not there yet. All a question of how evil fauci really is. Did he gamble on making a preemptive universal cure for pandemics like he claimed, and accidentally caused this mess. Or did he make it to be turned loose to drive the world to its knees and then give them 1 2 punch of an ineffective vaccine with extra sinister features. You know?</p>
