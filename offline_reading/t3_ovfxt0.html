        <p>I totally agree with this. I am not asking for name and address. I want to know if they were quite fit, or 150kg or smoked 5 packs of cigarettes a day or had cancer or recovered from debilitating disease.  </p>
<p>This is the context I am after. Of course some fit people are going to die from it somewhere along the line. But it seems they go out of their way to not mention anything and are vague as fuck about it. </p>
<p>When I see people shedding crocodile tears for someone in their 80's who died with corona I call them out. I understand family members maybe sad but some random person on the internet shouldn't give a shit. </p>
<p>We had a lady in her 30's die with corona. Everyone was sad and saying this affects everyone and anyone can die with it. All the government said was she had no underlying conditions. Never hear a thing about it again. Could've been 39 years old. Could've been 150kg. We will never know. But they use her to lock us down harder and take the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yep, so many times I see OMG 30 year old dies *from* coronavirus, scroll down and see an epic chungus, just curious about that data.</p>
<p>But yeah, people mostly read the title, titles are manufactured to be psychologically manipulative, present data from a certain angle, or be emotionally manipulative.</p>
<p>It's crazy how this happened. We don't live in fear of 0.015% death rate of the flu, or any other number, just the magic 0.02%. lol. Tbh with the size of the human population we could have a disease a fraction of a decimal milder than influenza even, like a 0.008% death rate, and it would kill some people since there's a recorded <em>death</em> rate lol. It might kill some seemingly healthy people. That's the 0.008%. Funny how people will scream "how heartless, those are people!" about me stating that fact, but shut up when I mention they're implying all the people who took their own lives, were denied treatments or examinations during these brutal restrictions were "just" the sacrifice that hat to be made for covid. Those were people too, hell, this thing killed my 2 cats.</p>

<p>Agree. Too.many people being sacrificed on the alter of Covid. People being denied check ups, surgery, and missed diagnosis due to covid. People committing suicide or just giving up on life because of it being hopeless with no job, home. Then violence rises in these places. </p>
<p>But it's OK. Because if you don't tow the line you want to kill people and are selfish fucks. What a fucked up world this has become.</p>

        <p>If young and healthy people were dying regularly of this, it wouldn't make it into the news. Its that simple.</p>
