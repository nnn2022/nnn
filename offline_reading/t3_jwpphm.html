    <strong>Having a hard time getting judged by everyone for wanting to see my mom over Christmas instead of spending it alone</strong>
    <p><p>I’m hitting a breaking point with this. I’m not doing anything for thanksgiving, my local extended family had health care workers and my grandma is in her 90s. I’ll admit, I’m glad I don’t have to go. I lived so far from them as a kid I only saw them once a year so really it feels like we’re strangers with nothing in common. Sucks but that’s life. So I guess I’m doing my part this thanksgiving. </p>
<p>However, for Christmas I’m planning to spend my last winter break of grad school across the country with my mom for a month, who I’m close with. We both live alone and our school/work is remote so we aren’t going out much anyway. I’m usually excited, but I’ve been having friends tell me I’m being selfish for going, some saying they’re proudly staying at home, even if it means totally alone (not usually as a lot have live in partners but sometimes) because they’re ‘doing their part’. Even more aren’t saying it to me directly, but are pronouncing it on social and saying anyone who dares see others is a horrible human.  This all is taking a toll on me mentally. I’ve cried several times over it. </p>
<p>Part of this is bc I have a flaw of wanting to be liked that hasn’t gone away despite being late twenties. I’m a people pleaser. But...I love my mom. Most of our friends have cut us off of their bubble (her friends have grandkids whose parents won’t let them visit otherwise, a lot of mine are just doomers themselves or living with people that are). We both are mostly at home. Experts have said air travel is actually pretty safe. Our mental health is tanking, and I love the holidays-if I’m alone I’m honestly worried about turning to drinking the month away or something like that. </p>
<p>It just sucks. Why is seeing one family member make me horrible? And why don’t people realize there are people living alone right now who are in scary mental health situations with the message that’s being spread? </p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, just needed to let this out and this group has been awesome.</p></p>

        <p>Never feel guilty for wanting to spend time with your mom. If you’re friends are being ignorant and judgmental over your decision, perhaps they’re not the kind of people you need to surround yourself with?</p>
<p>If you look at the flip side of the coin, what if this is your moms (or your) last Christmas on Earth? How crappy of a feeling would both of you have knowing you didn’t get together for one last Christmas? </p>
<p>I’m not denying that Covid is a dangerous disease, but at some point we have to live our lives.</p>
<p>My grandfather passed away this year, and I saw him all throughout Covid. I’m blessed to have spent so much time with him in his last months as it has put me at ease with his passing. I’m sure I’d be full of regret and sorrow had I not got to spend the time with him that I did.</p>
<p>I really feel that each person and family needs to make the decision that is best for their own lives. You know where you have been and know where your mom has been in regards to risk factor. You both know hers and your health conditions to know if it’s considered high risk. </p>
<p>I say, Spend Christmas with your mom and enjoy every minute of it. Do not let your friends guilt you into skipping it - it may be time you’ll never get neck.</p>

        <p>A very hard moral lesson is to divorce one's self image and self worth from the opinions of others.  I'm over 60 and hope to achieve this some time soon. </p>
<p>I hesitate, but would suggest /r/Stoicism which has got a huge influx of people with similar problems.  You need to strive for what you know is right, not what other people think is right or think that you should do. </p>
<p>Use your own knowledge, your own common sense and your own desires.  Do what is right for you and those you care about.  And if you will forgive the language, Fuck the rest.</p>

        <p>Go see your mom. Do it for me and my boyfriend - because both of our mothers passed away and we can’t. Tell your friends you got a COVID test and quarantined, etc etc (and if you feel more comfortable doing that, you should), but screw those people. When NYC closed about a quarter of the city left to go stay with their parents for a while. No judgments at all there - there’s no difference.</p>

        <p>Do it. Fuck those virtual signalers. They probably just want to be liked, too, and their way of “fitting in” is by going with the narrative. </p>
<p>One option is to just do what you want, and don’t even tell anyone, or post about it online. </p>
<p>I am a people person/people pleaser, too. I am incredibly social, an extrovert. I used to be a happy, bubbly person with a ton of friends and strong ties to the community. Now, I am a sad, lonely alcoholic. But, I will say that when I have spoken out about things like lockdowns on facebook—despite getting brutally attacked by my so-called friends, I have also had a <em>ton</em> of people reach out to me privately. Turns out there are a lot if others who feel like we do, they are simply not speaking out about it—presumably because they see how badly the people that do are getting bullied. </p>
<p>Also, I live in Tucson. My home is welcome for thanksgiving. I have a big yard, and I am happy to have anyone come over who has no place to go.</p>

<p>Then they're not real friends, and you should be done with them.</p>
<p>As for the pain their words cause you, sorry that you have to experience this. If I may, I'd like to pass along a recommendation for a book that might help you work past the stress they are causing you - Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. It is easily found.</p>
