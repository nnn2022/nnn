    <strong>If masks are so important and useful... why is it ok to have reusable ones that we simply wash?</strong>
    <p><p>If the masks really work at containing the virus from spread by droplet... then why are they not treated as hazardous waste?</p>
<p>Why is it acceptable to have reusable masks that we simply wash - washing does not kill any viruses on the masks surface... so why is it safe to leave masks lying around all over the place?</p>
<p>If they really captured this super deadly virus before it could be spread to another... would we not have to burn these masks after use or at least have biohazard units disposing of them.</p></p>

        <p>Of course this is a logical conclusion to come to if covid is as virulent as they claim but it is irrelevant, the people who pride themselves on wearing them do it for clout not safety</p>

        <p>Don't give them any ideas. If reusable masks weren't allowed, the disposable masks will become the syphilis blankets of the tuskegee experiment.</p>

        <p>Shhhh you‚Äôre not supposed to talk about how they work. Just wear the stupid thing on your face and don‚Äôt question it, peasant!</p>
<p>But seriously. I see some people that look like they‚Äôve been wearing the same disposable mask for 6 months. And these type of things are deemed ineffective after you touch the front of it with your unwashed hand. Still, so many people set their mask mouth-side down and constantly touch their face, but we‚Äôre not supposed to question any of it...</p>

        <p>Tbh I think about this every time I wear my gaiter out and about (I finally threw out all my masks and use this half-assed alternative when occasionally going to stores instead) - I keep thinking someone will be upset at me clearly not using anything close to protective-grade masks, but no one says anything. But if an elderly woman at the book store lets her mask slip, the soyboy behind a sheet of plexiglass will threaten her with the police. üòÆ‚Äçüí® Man I cannot wait until I can escape to the woods and withdraw from society</p>

        <p>Washing your hands doesn't kill viruses either. It literally and physically washes them off your hands. The same can be said of clothes. You then dry them in hot, which kills off anything that's left.</p>
<p>Masks fucking suck but this logic is bad.</p>

        <p>Do you also throw used papers tissues into one of the most expensive garbage cans that exists?   </p>
<p>And since I'm not going to bother to patrol this sub¬≤:  </p>
<p>No the vaccines don't stop the spread of covid, if one hadn't rushed to confirm one's biases one could have read so in the very first announcements, "xx% effective at preventing HOSPITALISATION". You call people cowards? This is rich people trying to protect their own skin and make a buck,  and them being rich people thinking themselves above the law... Well let's just say more testing would have been preferable... You're probably going to be fine though. And nobody seems to deny that in this sub, this club of freedom fighters is selfcensoring with pretend non-chalance, it's actually hilarious. Because secretly you are hoping that the others will take the bullet - I mean shot -  for you, and that all of this will blow over without you ever having to be involved in any form.  </p>
<p>Masks on the other hand... do you care to explain Japan's stats? We're talking about a 126 million inhabitants nation, that is heavily urbanized, go on put them right next to a smalltime european country with 10-20 million inhabitants of your trust, and make your case, I'm waiting. Attention: there is a sheeple malus for people simping about bordercontrol, talk about freedom inhibiting.  </p>
<p>Also, stop simping about the economy, you're the same people who claim you had a good life because you were with both feet in it, so I'm buying none of this sudden empathy for the unemployed. Besides I found the best job I ever had in the middle of fucking pandemic, so quit whining, you're allways convinced you're going to be one who will go lucky and unaffected, why not this time? You are needy babies that need constant validation even if it's negative, as evidenced by each and everytime you go to defy a mask mandate in a private business. Don't act like you're some anarchosyndicalist, you're little crybabies upset about having to compromise, eventhough upwards of 40 hours per week of your life are a compromising joke; but a little piece of tissue that's where you draw the line... Just so eager to be exploited again, as long it's away from your shitty family nobody asked you to found.  </p>
<p>And then there is the truely insane users: a showercurtain next to an outdoor table is the scariest thing you ever saw? Oh no random specs of dust, skin, hair and people stinky breath won't be able to land on plate so easily, EvErYbOdY sAvE tHeMsElVeS!!!!!!!11oneleven</p>
