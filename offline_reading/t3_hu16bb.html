    <strong>Had a...interesting conversation with a spokesperson from a major appliance manufacturer in the US</strong>
    <p><p>I asked a question on the Facebook account of this manufacturer because an appliance I wanted for my home has been backlogged for months, so I was wondering if/when it would be finally released. He responded:</p>
<p>&rt; I would say there is an 80% probability that all of our releases will be pushed back to 2021 or even 2022 at this point, for a multitude of reasons. </p>
<p>It made me feel...completely dejected. It's not even because I won't get the appliance or whatever. It seems, more and more likely now, that we are going to have to accept that this is going to go on into next year or beyond. Hints of this continue being dropped left and right in the last few days. Slowly, I am losing hope that life will ever go back to normal. Ever. Not just in 2020, but in general. People are still terrified. Just today, I saw people selling "Stay Home, Isolate" shirts on one of those pop culture websites, and it was a "top seller". People are gobbling this shit up, and don't seem to give a fuck about the future at all. They are all too happy to "stay home, isolate", wear masks, shame and insult dissenters... I hate humanity so much right now.</p></p>

        <p>And do what? Sign lame petitions? Go around picking fights with people wearing masks? Have a dozen of us show up and protest while everyone else mocks us? </p>
<p>For real, what are we supposed to do? Because I've tried to do my part, and I feel like just me having to shoulder all this crap in my area isn't enough. We'd need more support from the masses, which we are not getting. Not sure what more we, as we are right now, can do now.</p>

        <p>There's a lot we can do. Just need to think together or something. I've done my part. Had arguments with employees, I didn't start them mind you. I sent emails to several massive companies too.</p>
<p>Education, the real stuff, is falling on deaf ears. There's no time for people to stop and look at something factual anymore, let alone show open ears on this. I'm done talking with the "gone", and I want to meet others that are level headed and good at brainstorming.</p>
<p>I can't fight alone. I need others. We're in the same boat. There are many ways we can do things, don't get all rash on your own because we need to find calm and sane folks. We must regroup and listen to each other because we know who is deaf to our voices at this point. They expose themselves by the day. They'll be thankful even if it takes 70 years for them to see why we set out to accomplish what we practically forced to do.</p>

        <p>This just seems like it's easier said than done, especially since we're all spread throughout the country. I feel like an unarmed lone soldier in a huge warzone, trying to fight against the huge wave of guys with all sorts of ammo. It's been this way for me since March, when I was one of the very, <em>very</em> few who questioned the narrative back when it was still "two weeks to flatten the curve". I'm growing tired because it feels hopeless, and it feels like swimming against a rough current.</p>

        <p>I've been questioning this since March, too, and at the beginning it felt like more people were against the lockdown and "new normal" than they are now. Now you can't even say things in the subreddits we're supposed to be able to discuss it (this one, mask skepticism, lockdownskepticism, etc) without being brigaded and harassed. Even Reddit is starting to give me anxiety, and I only stick to these sorts of subs now. It's exhausting to even exist in this new 1984 world.</p>

        <p>Imposed alienation and disillusionment onto anybody is one of the greatest causes for direct action. It's one of the primal fears and emotions that can trigger in people. In 1998 a Vietnam veteran murdered a police officer, it was caught on the dash cam. This guy came back home at the time with the typical PTSD symptoms which still wasn't understood at the time by most people. It caused him to spiral in life, as is typical of such condition, and he ended up murdering somebody.<br>
There's an interview on another veteran saying that when he came back home he just stayed in his old room at his mother's house for a long time. His mother couldn't understand what was wrong with him at all.</p>
<p>If this pandemic situation, for sake of saying so, ends at the end of 2020 or 2021 it could cause a spike in massacres/mass murders, serial murder, and maybe worse. But it could also really begin as a result of the trauma in 10 years from now if not 5 or less. Trauma in general and alienation and general disillusionment affects all people differently in the most unimaginably complex ways. The trauma doesn't stop when this merry-go-round stops. The implication of dark times afterwards is 100% plausible.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. Let's not give up, to be blunt and half-empty. I've been against the narrative since before the first quarantine when the TP crap started. Don't quit trying to find new people to talk to so you can find new perspectives and ideas, so you can form new ideas and opinions for yourself to really figure out what you're going to personally do or deal with the circus and shit storm.</p>
<p>In the real world I only have one person who listens to what I say and is, gladly, on the same page as I am.</p>

<p>I have been trying to "just live in my life", and it doesn't seem to make any difference whatsoever. People are still terrified, and nobody cares about what I've had to say on the matter, save for some people in these subs.</p>

        <p>Yeah I mean my overall advice is to not be a victim of the lockdowns.  I have no knowledge of the nuances of CA’s current situation, but if indoor dining is closed, go to some place with outdoor service.  Go to one of the open beaches.  Get out and about.  Basically lead by example to show that you’re not afraid of a virus with an IFR or .1-.3%, and you’re not going to be confined to your house for weeks/months when it defies logic/science.</p>

        <p>Dude. It’s 100 degrees in the day here right now. In fact in Palm Springs it’s over 110 almost all day. . It can be 90 at 10 pm in the low desert. You literally can’t sit outside in any sort of comfort during the hot summer months. I live in the hi desert. It’s cooler. No beaches. Nearest beach is 140 miles away. And I think beaches are closed. They shut the beach car parks. Rest rooms. They don’t want us on beaches. I live in a small desert community. We had very little to begin with. Soon there will be no places left. As I said it’s dire. I see my friends. We have dinner at each other’s houses. We shop together. We hike. But it’s dire!! I am most definitely not a victim type but the reality is not that simple sadly. I am a Brit. I got fight in me but. It’s getting so difficult.</p>

        <p>The point of my post is that it seems like everyone is expecting this to go into 2021 or even 2022. You really think it's only major companies saying this? It's being laid on pretty thick all over, from the government to the so-called experts to everyone else. There's even another article posted here today about concerts and other events not coming back until 2022. It's "speculation", sure, but it is becoming more obvious by the day now. (Plus the government documents from Washington state that I posted the other day also mentioned they expect this to go on into March 2021 or winter 2021, depending on whatever factors they seem to employ.)</p>

        <p>Perhaps one of the end goals of the medical fascists is to get humanity to hate itself.  This, too, must be resisted.</p>

        <p>Nobody wants this to go on forever. We all want to get back to a regular life again. But I also don't want ICU beds to fill up.   </p>
<p>How do we keep that from happening? We reduce how much the virus spreads. How do we do that? Some combination of social distancing, wearing masks, and closing businesses. If one of those things upsets you, then we should just do more of one of the other things to make up for it.</p>
<p>It seems like you would rather things be back to normal, but also allow the virus to spread unchecked in the process. How is it that you don't understand what this means for hospital beds? Like are you paying attention to your local hospitals and figuring that they're doing okay, so that means stories about other hospitals being at capacity are just exaggerating or something? We haven't quite hit disaster yet, but that's because of measures like this. Do you have some models you could point us to that would convince us that things really can just go back to normal?</p>
<p>Here's a good interactive visualization you can play with and see what it looks like when you stop doing certain things, and what it means for ICU beds, for instance:</p>
