    <strong>Dealing with COVID working in the movie business.</strong>
    <p><p>How’s it going guys, I work construction in the movie business and as you guys can imagine it’s the most woke business out there. I thought I’d share some ridiculous stories of what these production people have put us through. 
The first and funniest thing, which was also what inspired me to make this post, is that after we built a set they had us literally take a sawzall and cut holes in the walls for “COVID airflow”. What the hell is that. There was also this huge wall that was supposed to be in the set, but they opted to use a huge drape instead, again for more airflow.
Also we just got done doing a location in the middle of a huge open field in the Georgia summer heat. We had to build an entire village and it took 4 months. Production ordered us to wear masks out in the heat but my boss who has common sense fought back saying that we’d all get heat strokes. Of course those idiots wouldn’t know how dangerous it is to build for 11 hours in the sun with a mask on. They haven’t lifted a finger in their life. Anyway they relented but made it so that everyone had to had their own golf cart to get around (the location spanned over miles, too far to walk). This was actually a pretty sweet perk. 
Anyway that’s just a couple things, there’s plenty of dumb pointless things that those clueless hacks made us do. I could write forever about it. What about you guys? Any arbitrary things your business put you through?</p></p>
