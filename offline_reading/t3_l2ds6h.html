        <p>Bad news is that if the government votes to give 500 pounds to anyone who tests positive, the "infection numbers" will skyrocket... thereby justifying continued lockdowns.</p>

        <p>&rt; I'm sorry for your medical issues. But your medical issues are not MY medical issues. </p>
<p>Well you're agitating people for giving more people my exact medical issues, so frankly you don't get to slither out of personal responsibility with a glib word and a pretty turn of phrase.</p>
<p>&rt; You can feel angry about it all day. We are free men and women, and you have to learn to accept that.</p>

We have a real government, and an informed population where <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/lockdown-boris-johnson-yougov-poll-b680047.html">80% support national lockdown.</a> People re-opening according to this poster will just get fined and closed again.</p>

        <p>You mean the ones that based their assertion of lockdowns saving lives on predicted\estimated deaths and infection rates? Sure, if they have a crystal ball that can actually tell the future, I would be willing to take those studies over the one that compares real numbers.</p>
<p>If I sing happy birthday before getting a biopsy and it comes back negative for cancer when the doctor thought it would be positive, that doesn't prove singing happy birthday prevents cancer. Likewise, predicting deaths and then locking down and not seeing as many death as predicted doesn't prove lockdowns prevented deaths. Maybe, just possibly, the predictions were wrong.</p>
<p>If only we could look at timelines of when lockdowns were implemented against new case rates and see if they did anything to slow or stop the spread... oh, wait... https://rationalground.com/mask-charts/</p>

        <p>Did I say I've broken any of the rules? I don't think I did you know. I disagree with many, many laws in this country but I haven't broken any.</p>
<p>So, maybe instead of blaming the public for your misfortune, maybe you can place blame on nature for producing the virus. You can place blame on Darwin's Theory of Evolution for allowing SARS-CoV-2 to evolve to infect humans.</p>
<p>The logical conclusion from what you have just said is that lockdowns don't work to protect everyone, surely? Knowing that, those who consider themselves vulnerable and want to protect themselves from the disease should take their own, very serious, precautions (using home delivery for shopping etc.) until a vaccination is made available to them.</p>

<p>If that truly is the case, and you want to protect yourself from infectious respiratory illness, you need to shop at off-peak times, and you could also wear goggles with a mask if you were so inclined; That way all exposted orifices are covered and you are less likely to come into contact with an infected droplet.</p>
<p>This is also another argument against lockdown, since if smaller shops were able to open, you may have been able to shop there where it would be less busy... Or at the very least, some people shopping in smaller shops would mean larger ones are less busy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Thanks for the implication that it's my own stupid fault though.</p>
<p>I never said it was your fault, if you read carefully. Catching SARS-CoV-2 is no one's fault. Viruses are going to do what they do best, which is replicate. Unlelss you trap yourself in a box forever, there will always be a chance you will get it, regardless of any lockdown measures imposed. Unfortunately, you were unlucky, and that sucks, I feel you. I've had it before and it does suck, but what I'm not about to do is blame someone for passing it onto me. You cannot place blame onto any group or individual when you get an infectious respiratory illness (unless someone coughs in your face, deliberatrly spreading it to you, or something stupid like that then sure). It is an inevitibility that you will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, Influenza or some other infectious virus in your life, so there is no point in blaming anyone for it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Blaming nature is pointless. Nature doesn't change its actions based on  feedback. Humans however, being thinking beings, can be convinced  through reasoned argument.</p>
<p>Correct, but nature does change itself by brute force and random mutation, that is why I referenced Darwinism. Viruses will naturally become more prevelant if they mutate to become more infectious and less deadly. If they become more infectious then they can replicate better, meaning other variants will be bread out of existence or into obscurity. If they become less deadly, then it means there will be more viable hosts for them, further increasing their replicability. SARS-CoV-2 will only become more infectious over time, so it is likely that most people will be exposed to it, so what are we going to do, blame everyone?</p>

<p>Even the CDC and WHO only consider "close contact" with COVID to be within 6 feet for 15 minutes or longer. You probably didn't get COVID at the store if you were actually following the rules. The overwhelming majority of COVID spread is from coworkers and family, not brushing past someone in an aisle.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure you understand how masks and social distancing work. They limit risk, they don't eliminate risk. If you're 90% less likely to get sick following proper procedure and such, that still leaves a 10% chance. That chance is then multiplied by the base rate chance of getting infected in that scenario.</p>
<p>At that time we worked work 2 days in the office, 3 days at home. At the office we must all wear medical masks at all times and never sit next to another human. Hand sanitiser lives on every shelf. No visitors are allowed. We have not seen our family in person since summer. No-one at either of our workplaces got sick. It must have been the food shop, since that is the only other place we went in the 2 weeks leading up to the infection. </p>

<p>I don't think you are a liar for getting unlucky. I think you are lying to try to strengthen your point with an appeal to emotion and anecdotal evidence of your point, both of which would be fallacious even if you are telling us the absolute truth. </p>
<p>You're a single rando. Your experience doesn't matter when applying laws to hundreds of millions of people. Hundreds of kids die in swimming pools every year and I am sure that is super shitty for the families of those kids, but we aren't banning swimming pools for everyone because something bad happened to them. Likewise, I am sure it is super shitty for anyone that lost someone to COVID or got fucked up from it, the extremely overwhelming majority of which are elderly or in bad health, but COVID still has a fatality rate well under half a percent for the people that actually get it and that is not justification to ruin the lives of millions upon millions of people and wreck the future prosperity of our children for.</p>

        <p>I don't really understand your sentiment. Are you saying "we" as in the hospitality sector, "we" as in your private business, and do you mean that your opening of your single business made the whole third lockdown worse for the entire country or do you mean everyone opening up made the third lockdown worse? I don't remember this happening before...</p>

        <p>Everything opening up before christmas made the cases and deaths in the UK worse than any of the previous peaks. We as in the entire country not one business or sector. We went from a lock down to restrictions to lesser restrictions to a hard lock down.</p>
<p>Currently cases and deaths are still on the rise and lockdown is going to continue until at least mid February before it is reviewed. If we reopen things back up it will just push us back into another lock down rather than just restrictions.</p>

        <p>Deaths won't drop, not quickly it will either plateau or increase as it lags behind cases. As for cases that will fluctuate but i dunno if it will go up or down. The innaccuracy is estimated between 2 and 29% but depends on how many tests taken per person and which test you're taking.</p>
<p>Even so the number cases is going to be higher than the number tested cases, just today the BBC is running a story that less than 1/5th of people with covid are actually getting a test.</p>

        <p>What would your idea of a lockdown be, posting a sentry outside everyone's house for three weeks? Besides, hospitality was not open during Lockdown 2, nor for much of the country before that. </p>
<p>There are 10m essential workers in the UK. People still need to eat, shop and receive deliveries. There's always going to be people leaving the house, unless you want them to starve (but then again , if everyone starved, there would be no covid), so there's only so much the measures can do.</p>

        <p>Lockdown is working from home where possible and schools closed basically, we've been in 2 lockdowns in the second one now with just restrictions in between. Unless you count the 2 week firebreak in wales.</p>
<p>Of course people need to eat and shop that's not gonna change but there plenty of other that aren't really essential or can work remotely that choose not to.</p>
