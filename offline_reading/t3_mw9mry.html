    <p><p>There is an NHS advert about this and I find it confusing. We were told over the past year not to meet up with friends/family outside, but now they’re saying it’s safe because Covid can be blown away by the wind. Wtf.</p></p>

        <p>Because it’s all bollocks that’s why! I am not a covid denier at all, but I don’t believe as bad as we were told. Things don’t add up for me. Although perhaps if we had a competent government that didn’t flip flop over everything I would have more faith in what they’ve been telling us!</p>

        <p>Exactly. CoVid was never as bad as they made it out to be in the real world.</p>
<p>Yes, if you were elderly and had numerous pre-ex's, it was likely to end your life... but you had to be REAL elderly over 80 or have LOTS of pre-ex's, pages worth.</p>
<p>The other thing is that it is kinda chaotic among those 18-50. It was taking out bodybuilders and ballerinas who were in the best shape of their lives and going over unhealthy people or just giving them the sniffles.</p>
<p>That is what made it scary to a lot of people.</p>
