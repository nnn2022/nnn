    <strong>We don't have any freedoms, so forget about the idea that we're going to get our 'freedoms' back</strong>
    <p><p>I've been keeping an eye on the media coverage of vaccine passports, in the vain hope that someone will say some negative about them at some point. </p>
<p>Here's an example article: "Is there a way to make vaccine passports ethically acceptable?". Twenty years ago, the idea this sort of dystopian notion would have been unthinkable and repulsive, but today it's just a subject of abject chatter. Hey, could we make it ethical for your every single move to be tracked, and for you to be denied the most basic activities due to exercising your most basic right to bodily freedom? It's a tough one, but let's have a think about it...</p>
<p>Leaving that aside, all of these articles continually say the same thing. How can we get our freedoms back? When will we get our freedoms back? The aforementioned article makes reference to this several times:</p>
<p>&rt;A different way of framing vaccine passports is as an incentive for people to get jabs – “get vaccinated and we’ll give you your freedoms back”.</p>
<p>Also...</p>
<p>&rt;It’s one thing to argue that the state doesn’t have the right to curtail your freedoms once you’re vaccinated and pose less of a threat to others, another to be given an ultimatum: “get a vaccine or we’ll keep you locked down”.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>&rt;Once people have their jab, they pose much less of a risk to others. Following Mill’s principle, it would therefore be unjust to continue curtailing their freedoms.</p>
<p>If something can be taken away, and then made subject to certain conditions over which you have no control, it's not a freedom. By definition, it's not a freedom. Freedom means:</p>
<p>&rt;the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>&rt;the state of not being imprisoned or enslaved.</p>
<p>What this whole issue should make crystal clear is that WE HAVE NO FREEDOMS! That should be blatantly obvious! You have the right to remain silent, that's about it!</p>
<p>Any 'freedoms' from hereon in will have to be won, and this will only come via a hard fought process. I don't think this will happen for one second, so I will assume going forward that I have no rights, no freedoms, and no reason to expect any.</p></p>

        <p>Im not sure about other countries. But in the US the founding fathers tied freedom with God-given inalienable rights. This was so that if government and laws turned tyrannical, metaphysically they were in violation of natural order/God and thus in the hearts/minds of the populace revolution was justified and commended as a restoration to a God-ordained natural order. </p>
<p>Now we are in a situation where this metaphysical supposition is not realized or respected by government or the vast majority of the populace. </p>
<p>If there is no widespread transcendent ideology which sets boundaries for government to protect freedom, tyranny will be imposed as a practical means against temporary crises. And the people will go along with it because it seems expedient in the moment. </p>
<p>This is all to say; We have freedom. Freedom is the natural state of mankind. Freedom is ordained by God, the universe, or whatever metaphysical power you believe in. But it is under attack and those that are attacking it are not the highest authority in the universe.</p>

        <p>Funny thing about "God given" freedom is that "God" also gave out 613 restrictions that must be obeyed. Not all that 'free'. </p>
<p>That is irrelevant though, even for those of us that live in USA &amp; talk about freedom, we were never free &amp; never will be. We have government given privileges &amp; they can be rescinded at a whim. The "lockdowns" are just another reminder of that fact.</p>

        <p>You said we were never free and will never be free. I dont subscribe to that and no one who is fighting for freedom is. Theyve broken your will because youve lost all hope and fighting spirit. But. Your entitled to your opinions so good luck with those.</p>
