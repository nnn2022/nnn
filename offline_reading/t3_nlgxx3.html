    <strong>People here keep claiming that covid is a hoax, this makes the rest of us look crazy.</strong>
    <p><p>It's obvious that we have been sold many lies pertaining to the pandemic. From the origins, to the mask efficacy, to the safety of the vaccine and many others. The people claiming that the virus never existed and was really just the seasonal flu are mislead, mistaken or spreading lies to discredit those who think rationally.  </p>
<p>I had covid along with a large amount of people that I know. Someone very close to me also died from it albeit with sever comorbidities (lung cancer, so the flu likely would have killed her if she got that either). The symptoms of it varied greatly in kind and with the progression of the sickness. This was very obviously not the flu from my experience.  </p>
<p>There are undoubtedly conspiracies afoot here but the existence of a novel pathogen is not one of them. Please stop spreading this lie, it makes us all look like idiots.</p></p>

<p>Here is what we do know:</p>

        <p>You are clueless to what covid is a hoax means.   It means it isn’t going to kill you if you are maskless.  It means you won’t get it simply leaving your house.   It means EVERYTHING cnn/fox says is a lie.   It means 600,000 did NOT die directly from it.   It means lockdowns were useless.  It means all the stupid “rules” are bullshit.  It means rules for thee but not for me.   </p>

        <p>"No, it doesn't."  Did I change anyones mind by saying that?  Probably not.  Making blanket statements about this topic have no effect. </p>
<p>There is some controversy about the very existence of the sars-cov-2 virus.   Statements made by the CDC indicated that it had not been isolated and no actual samples of virus were available for study.</p>
<p>There is also the exosome theory - that what we call 'viruses' are actually produced by our own cells as a means of communications outside the body to other bodies.  (Notice I said theory - this has not been proved either, but it can still be discussed.)</p>
<p>As far as I know there are no actual pictures of sars-cov-2.</p>
<p>You had a sickness of some kind.   You have no real proof that it was 'covid'.    The PCR test is not a valid test for any specific virus.   It looks for very small segments of genetic code that could come from many things.</p>
<p>I am not saying sars-cov-2 definitively does not exist.   I am saying it is valid to ask the question about it's existence, and demand evidence.</p>

        <p>Great points. I don’t claim to know exactly what’s going on but just like past events (polio, Swine Flu 76, AIDS) there’s more to it than they’re telling us. </p>
<p>Covid-1984 even has Fauci and Montagnier lurking about. </p>
<p><strong>Too bad Fauci critics like (PCR inventor) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/science/kary-b-mullis-dead.html">Kary Mullis</a> and journalist/gay rights activist <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/08/16/d-c-journalist-terry-michael-dies-at-70/">Terry Michael</a> both died of “pneumonia” exactly two years apart on August 7th.</strong></p>
<h2>Mullis died 3 days before Epstein’s “suicide”.</h2>
<p>Mullis was a bioweapons consultant that had toured <strong>Ft. Detrick</strong> in the past.</p>
<p><strong>2 days before Mullis’ death The NY Times reported:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html">“Deadly Germ Research Is Shut Down at Army Lab Over Safety Concerns”</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"I could spray anthrax right out this window</strong> and nobody would even know it," <strong>Mullis says.</strong> "We need to be thinking about that."</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Mullis is thinking about anthrax</strong> and other biological weapons because he's consulting for a company that's seeking a federal contract to study biological warfare. <strong>This morning, he toured Fort Detrick,</strong> in Frederick, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1998/11/03/nobel-chemist-kary-mullis-making-waves-as-a-mind-surfer/31e7e720-44e4-49ff-8458-a9822cdcb47e/">where military scientists research the issue.”</a></p>

        <p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>Or we just read the actual study "discovering" Sars-Cov-2.</p>
<p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>Covid is a HOAX, it is nothing more than the common cold and flu relabeled as a new virus. <br>
People get sick, take the corrupt PCR test and it says “positive“ and they think.. OMG covid</p>
<p>or doctors tell them it’s Covid. Nothing but lies</p>
<p>all this talk about “I lost my sense of taste and smell” yeah? Big deal.. Happens to me all the time when I have sinus issues.</p>

        <p>I believe there is real SARS out there screwing people up, but the rest it's bullshit and the PCR tests caught people up with colds and flus to jack the numbers. I know too many doctors and nurses who told me people died.</p>

        <p>People here are upvoting a post with this content.  They are stupid, or evil.</p>
<p>"
 • The MSM was used to fake numbers and spread lies about the lethality of the virus in order to justify locking down all major countries, effectively bringing the entire world to its knees.</p>
<p>• The Covid test kits were purposely created to produce an enormous amount of false positives in order to spike infection rates. Kary Mullis, the inventor of the PCR test, had very strong opinions on Anthony Fauci. Kary died on August 7th, 2019.</p>
<p>• The countries who didn't lockdown suffered less than those who did.</p>
<p>• Masks have been proven to be useless unless being used by a doctor in a medical environment. Studies also show that masks have caused massive amounts of harm physically and psychologically, as well as an entirely new littering pandemic.</p>
<p>• Vaccinated people are contracting Covid at a higher rate than the non-vaccinated. These people are also suffering from horrible side effects and even death in some cases. Despite this information being public, liberals are lining up to take the jab and receive their bribe for doing so."</p>
<p>None of that is remotely accurate. It's all lies.</p>
