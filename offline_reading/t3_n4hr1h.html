        <p>This article basically proves the tests, the vast majority run at between 40 and 50 cycles, are basically just noise. There is no logical scenario under which this McGill article was not understood to be sophistry by it's own author. There is an enormous logical jump made, followed by a typically sanctimonious appeal to not just authority, but stereotypes of the questioners that simply are not born out by reality. Those leading the questioning on this tact are all themselves PhDs in relevant fields, including the discoverer of PCR hiimself, Mullis, who already laid out a clear counter argument to the McGil claims decades ago.</p>
<p>Science controls for differences between data sets, creating methodology to normalize the sets to one another. The arguments it is impossible to control so why bother is absurd - under what sort of scientific reasoning would this important parameter be left un-recorded?</p>
<p>To me the only logical answer is a scenario in which the data collectors did not want to answer any hard questions about the accuracy of their data.</p>
<p>If it is true the Ct was \~40+ on the vast majority of PCR tests, it seems to me it indicates Covid barely exists, and all of the alleged Covid cases are Pneumonias, Flus, Colds, etc.</p>
<p>Even the Ct value, even with differernt markers being detected, to me, appears to still be the most fundamental indicator of sensitivity, and so far I have not hear of a PCR test that performs well over \~30 Ct, no matter the type - further shedding doubt on the McGil author's claims.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the mcGill article is simple sophistry - it lays out the argument being made, does not actually argue against it successfully, then declares 'those people are dumb' like some snopes hack job, basking in its credentialed poise and institutional authority.</p>
<p>The specific refusal to record Ct means there isnt even the most basic parameter available to attempt to use as a control, rendering the error bars on all the data in the 100% range given the fact the safest assumption for a given test is that it was run between 45 and 50 Ct as was widely reported.</p>
<p>The McGill article didnt debunk anything. it reaffirmed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ct is the most elementary and important parameter of the test</li>
<li>Ct over 25ish is very unreliable (CDC and fauci both says 37 Ct)</li>
<li>We have paper trail that shows directives above 40 Ct were common</li>
</ul>
<p>The CDC and WHO appear to have specifically refused to collect the Ct data, claiming it would be misleading, which to me sounds like they did not want any attempt made to make sense of their data, and they preferred to render it noise\junk</p>
<p>My opinion is that the McGill article is just one more piece of evidence that academia has completely failed humanity in 2020-21 and probably needs to be reigned in somehow. They are actively aiding a conspiracy to destroy our society.</p>

        <p>well said.</p>
<p>just from my recollection i saw somewhere that beginning 2020 fauci himself said something about ct over 26,27,28 is generating useless results</p>
<p>will see if i can find</p>
