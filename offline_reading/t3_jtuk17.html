    <strong>Life with a Doomer Mom- Humiliation on the Road</strong>
    <p><p>There might be an upcoming second wave in Ohio. No, I’m not talking about a wave COVID cases, but a wave of increased suicides, closure of local businesses, food insecurity, all of that lovely stuff. Earlier this week DeWine, dictator of Ohio, announced there might be another lockdown next week because the first one was apparently so effective that the mask mandate we had since March is still in place! The majority of Ohioans are pissed. DeWine has definitely ruined his chances of re-election in 2022.</p>
<p>After my mom heard about news, she said that masks are now required. Liar. Soon after she tried to spread the lie to the household, me and my dad went to Sheetz (Midwestern gas station). We were both mask-less and despite masks now being “required”, we weren’t kicked our nor were reminded to wear a mask while in the gas station.</p>
<p>The next day arrives and my mom gets a call from my younger sister’s principal. The principal shared that my younger sister was in contact with someone who had recently tested positive with COVID, and the school wouldn’t allow my sister to get person-learning the following week. Thankfully since I’m at a different school, this restriction didn’t apply to me. </p>
<p>After hearing the news, my doomer mom just had to tell everyone she knew about this-including my grandfather, who was going to drive me to my swim practice later that day. My grandfather is also a doomer, and after hearing the news, he requested me to wear a mask while in the car with him or he wouldn’t drive me to practice. </p>
<p>My grandfather arrives at my house. My mom reminds me to wear a mask, and I redundantly  do so. During the entire car ride, I tried to hide my face from the view of bystanders in cars and on the sidewalk to try to lessen the embarrassment and humiliation I was experiencing due to having the appearance of an ultra sheep: an individual who believes everything they see in Mainstream Media and would always have his face diaper in place no matter the circumstance. </p>
<p>To add more fuel to the fire, I was required to wear a mask during this trip but I was allowed to sit in the passenger seat of the car, which is no where near 6 feet away from the driver’s seat! What’s the point of wearing a mask a 2-4 seat car if the seats are at most 2 feet away from each other? Doomer logic never fails to amuse me.</p></p>
