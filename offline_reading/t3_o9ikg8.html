    <strong>They "leaked" the video of Matt Hancock so they could get rid of him and blame the delay on easing restrictions on him. It's a distraction.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm probably stating the obvious here but the average NPC doesn't think too much into these things. They probably just think he was caught shagging/breaking the rules and had to resign out of shame. Funny how that happened immediately BEFORE the massive protests this weekend (which the media have almost-completely ignored). Also right AFTER Dominic Cummings revealed that Boris thinks he's "totally fucking hopeless" and people (even those who have been obediant up till now) started turning on him for delaying the restrictions being eased; the government would want to get rid of him. He was toxic to the party.</p>
<p>It also conveniantly allows them to reverse their decision and open back up a bit sooner, which is what the new Health Secretary is hinting at doing (we'll know later today). They can blame it all on Hancock. He's a fall-guy; a sacrifcial lamb. Well, what happened to all the fucking Scientific™ data claiming we were on the verge of a third wave then? What about the fucking Scientists™ who urged caution? Now, don't get me wrong, if they open back up sooner that's fucking great but I don't trust these utter bastards to fuck us all in a couple months with further lockdowns and restrictions.</p>
<p>Either they've shat their pants because so many people are onto them and fucking furious at having their lives destroyed over this shit or this is part of a bigger plan (and they're merely throwing us a bone by easing restrictions early). Regardless, the "leaked" video was either staged or deliberately released by the government to get rid of Matt Hancock. Don't let your guard down, this shit is shady as fuck and I don't trust it one bit.</p></p>

        <p>Definitely staged. A real leaked video would have been phone footage of the security cam.</p>
<p>My guess is that this allows him an exit route before the shit hits the fan, that doesn't challenge the decisions he made as a minister.</p>
<p>I think Johnson will also be gone before year end for similar reasons.</p>

        <p>If you watch the NHS tribute from the 2012 olympics, it shows what looks like a Boris Johnson puppet in a hospital bed, and the bed turns upside down and is covered by shadows, sort of symbolistic of death. The whole thing is interesting to watch, seems to have a lot of predictive programming from what we’ve been going through since 2020.</p>

        <p>I knew it was staged as soon as I saw it. An unpopular health secretary is caught breaking the rules (on camera, how convenient) and is immediately asked/told to resign? Sure Jan.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t agree with you more.  I think this is a text book PR stunt. Also if it was allegedly a lockdown skeptic who got the photo and it happened back in May then why wait until now???</p>

        <p>Totally. It’s not like everyone in his office didn’t know he was banging his aide. They just needed a way to back out of it without just backtracking due to public pressure. It has to be his fault. Boris certainly wasn’t going to take the blame.</p>

        <p>If the jab-drive is running out of steam, I thinks its possible his departure was deemed necessary to provide fresh impetus / jab-relaunch.</p>
<p>While the UK has one of the highest % of jabbed population, there is strong vaccine hesitancy in some ethnic minority groups. </p>
<p>Appointing a health minister from an ethnic minority background would may be a calculated decision to encourage uptake in more jab-hesitant communities.</p>

        <p>The timing could not have been more perfect. Distract people from the huge protest the next day and also cover up the monumental fuck up by the track and trace system. Both of which passed without any attention. </p>

        <p>Possible. But if it were staged, wouldn't you expect BoJo to have sacked him straight away, instead of BoJo accepting Matt Wankcock's apology, and then Matt Wankcock resigning 24-48 hours later when he finally accepted his position was completely untenable?</p>

        <p>Boris is well known for having affairs so it would have made him look like an even bigger hypocrite (although by not sacking him he's not done himself any favours). Best I can guess is that they didn't want to sack him as that would make it look more suspicious? It's a weird one for sure.</p>

        <p>Fair point. I've just thought of something. We know that Matt Wankcock is a lackey of the WEF, so it might be that BoJo either didn't feel that he had the power to sack him, at least not without clearing it with his handlers at the WEF, or that Wankcock would almost certainly resign of his own accord.</p>
