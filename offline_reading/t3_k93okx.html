<p>Florida was one of the least lockdown friendly states in the country and was considered something of a success story.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The implication is that they were hiding numbers and took a computer away from a data scientist who wanted to show the real numbers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If this is true it could cripple the lockdown critical movement.  The case is being made that Florida's Covid crisis was bad enough so that data had to be faked and now there's accusations of a cover up. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Is there any way to tell how true this story is?  What can be done to address this?</p></p>

        <p>The statistical can get bent either way. I don't care anymore. </p>
<p>My own two eyes are enough for me. 9 months into this thing, not one person I know has been in hospital let alone died from Covid. </p>
<p>The historical context of what real tragedies in the world look like vs this? FFS. This is a man made disaster in response to normal phenomenon of a new cold virus going through the population. Like has probably happened thousands of times through history. </p>
<p>You want to flip society on its head for this? Then seriously, get bent.</p>

        <p>She's not a scientist, first of all. </p>
<p>If you disagree tell me which experiments she's done or which papers she's published. </p>
<p>Second, given that the media has almost without exception reported incorrect information about this woman (see my first point) what reason is there for trusting the media reporting on her now?</p>

<p>Uh, yeah, that's the point. Isn't the timing for this very interesting?</p>
<p>I know some people in Florida who were beginning to come around from the fear, but now they've become hysterical again because they believe DeSantis is lying, and Covid is actually killing hundreds of thousands in Florida. So it seems to be working in their favor. The people behind this know what they are doing.</p>

        <p>She was using government property to make her “claims” after she was fired. So she was illegally holding on to something she didn’t own. So yes, they raided her place because she illegally kept government property. It’s not that hard or complicated. It doesn’t “prove” anything, or any sort of fudging of the numbers. It doesn’t mean fudging didn’t happen, but this doesn’t bolster that claim at all</p>

        <p>So the anti-old folk virus went wild in the retirement state? And people are surprised?</p>
<p>They want the numbers covered up because they don't want people to know that the virus did what it was released to do.</p>
