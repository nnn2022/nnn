    <p><p>I mentioned that OSHA says the masks everyone wears do not stop the spread of airborne transmissibles. </p>
<p>Anyway, keep being open to discussion, friends. Dialogue is healthy, unlike lockdowns and tyranny.</p></p>

It's been like a therapeutic massage for my covid insanity stressed brain. Thank you all for having some critical thinking and not being brainwashed into submission by fear. Really.

        <p>You're arguing with people who have replaced religion with their fragmented interpretation of what they believe science to be. None of these people have an understanding of the scientific process. That isn't a generalization. If they understood it, they wouldn't be slavishly devoted to this cause.</p>

        <p>You did the exact same thing that many of them do when they come here.</p>
<p>You went in, posed an "innocent question" with a very obvious concern troll tone, then go on to bait them into arguing with you while you basically laugh at how "stupid" they are and essentially trolling them. So, yes, you were being a troll. A pretty obvious one, to me. </p>
<p>And no, you're not comabting tyranny, you're just getting off on making them mad and getting attention from them, including your precious ban.</p>

        <p>Don't be such a prick. You don't know me, and you don't know my heart. For the record, you're entirely wrong. I wasn't "trolling". My questions were genuine as is my concern for these people who are totally brainwashed. Nor do I "laugh at how stupid they are". It is a good and proper way to combat tyranny by trying to openly engage in discussion concerning the draconian rules we're all experiencing, especially to those who are so welcoming of them. Or, do you also pretend to know that not a single one of them will ever listen or receive what one of us might say? People aren't cast like metal. We all can change and grow and learn.</p>

        <p>No, saying they’re deceived is treating them as inferior. They made a choice. They chose to close themselves off from reason and not face their fears and ego. You can try and try but these people made the choice to be in their fear bubble.</p>
<p>They also have different priorities than reason and logic. They like to be comfortable in their beliefs or use their beliefs as a shield from an ugly truth about themselves (we all do to some extent). </p>
<p>Instead of exploring their cognitive dissonance (which is extremely hard) they made a choice to be coddled by their beliefs. </p>
<p>They made a choice to ban you and a choice to be in their fear inducing echo chamber. (Cortisol is as addictive as dopamine btw)</p>
<p>They by choice live unexamined lives. It’s a choice, a hard one, but still in their hands.</p>

        <p>I realize that people make choices, but I find it worth while to back up a little bit: it starts with worldview. Some people, most actually, think we live in a world where everything is as it seems, and no one is out to get you. The news doesn't tell lies all day, scientists are always honest when it comes to revealing their "discoveries", and politicians are people like us who are just having a hard time agreeing on the best policy for any given scenario. </p>
<p>These fearful people are not inferior because they have been deceived, it could have been any one of us depending on our upbringing and any number of external (or internal) influences that made us think the way we do. Nature and nurture combine to make us who we are, and it made these people think that when daddy government says there's a big scary virus and lockdowns are necessary, it's just true.</p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance is exactly what happens when they are faced with the reality that conflicts with their worldview. I hope to believe that maybe after enough exposure to the discrepancies, they (or some) might be able to break through the lies. Get red pilled. </p>
<p>Anyway you might totally disagree and that's fine, I'm just trying to explain myself that's all.</p>

        <p>I see your point too. And I hope too that some of these people start waking up. It just gets infuriating when the cause of so much strife and destruction of our lives is not because of the politicians or the corrupt rulers, but by mass compliance of the masses. We enforce ourselves to the whims of the elite. </p>
<p>Don’t know what the answer is. But you raise a valid point and I have been trying to be more compassionate. </p>

        <p>I totally hear you, lately I've been wondering what's worse: a mad man preaching crazy talk on the street corner, or the group of people who stop to listen and end up following him? Lunatics only become troublesome or dangerous once they have a following. But it's like Rothschild said, "When you assume the position of power, people soon give it to you." </p>
<p>I too am right pissed about how dumb people are, but getting mad and hostile toward them has the opposite effect; you would want it to be like a smack in the face that wakes them up, but pride is a huge factor for many people. Instead, hostility causes people to dig in their heels and feel more convinced that they are on the "right side" because they are facing opposition, persecution or whatever.</p>
<p>So calmly and gently bringing up facts and contradictions seems like the only other way. Maybe it is hopeless though lol, I hope not. At this point it feels like we're fighting for the few to wake up but we know the many are not able to be reached.</p>

        <p>It goes to show many of these people don't want discussion, they're all about censorship. Keep in mind you don't know who's on the other side, it could be a 13 year old Gretta.</p>

        <p>Something I’d love to do that my friend henna is doing in Spain is street activism. What if we take our 30k strong the the streets where we live. These are the people we have the most chance of waking up- when we’re eye to eye - hearts within 6 feet of each other. The people are getting weary and more receptive every day. We can lead with this message In greater ways than wasting our breath in that sub with carbon dioxide breathing close minded brainwashed individuals. They don’t want t see things differently. It challenges their whole house of cards they can’t  let fall because their egos are too fragile to have the world view challenged. Let’s go to the streets where the people are and we can connect there. Who is with me?</p>

        <p>I went to the streets, saw people get arrested and brutalised by the cops. I'm still down for it, but only if we can get a decent number of us, very difficult in the UK when they deploy 20 van loads of police at the first sign of protest.</p>
