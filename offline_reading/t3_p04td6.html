    <strong>Nephew, 17, woke up yesterday with a 99.8° mild fever, severe aches, congestion, headache and lethargic. Felt like crap all day. Sister called MD who's also big on healthy living NOT thru pharma. Here's what they recommended:</strong>
    <p><p>(To begin, i am not a doctor nor am i giving any advice to anyone. This is merely anecdotal and meant as good news. If you have severe symptoms, get help.)</p>
<p>If positive test or exposed:
Zinc 22mg/day 2x/day
D 10,000iu/day (he took 15k yesterday)
C 1000mg 3x/day</p>
<p>If symptoms presented also:
NAC 500mg 2x/day
Quercetin any brand, follow recommended dose</p>
<p>He did not get tested. He did as listed. </p>
<p>(Note: he's been taking 5,000 iu of D, 150 mcg K2, and 1000 mg of C daily for several months so is not likely D deficient.)</p>
<p>Woke up today with only congestion which he'd described as feeling like seasonal allergies. Energy returned. Upset he couldn't go to friend's party.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah "Delta Variant" passed through my whole family. Wife asymptomatic. Me, mild sniffles. Several of our kids just a mild cold. 13 year old had a mild fever, similar symptoms you described. He went to sleep early and woke up on the mend. </p>
<p>You know what I think? Your nephew would have been fine without all that.</p>
<p>CDC numbers say 721 people under 25 died from Covid-19 in 2020.  Meanwhile we're a nation of around 330 million people. Remember, there was a time in the not too distant past when no one panicked if someone got a little sick.</p>
<p>You get a germ. Your body recovers. And then you're immune. </p>
<p>We got our mild Delta Variant from a fully vaccinated family member by the way, who came over sniffling, snotting, and coughing all over. I'm glad though. Not only did we not need the last vaccine, we don't need the next.</p>
<p>Anyhow, glad to hear your nephew is doing better but I'm guessing there may have been some unnecessary panic going on.</p>
<p>I should also point out that out of my family, the ones that have been most active, around and about had the least symptoms, with my 13 year old being the one who was exposed to the least because he doesn't go to stores with us, etc. I suspect he had less natural immunity from being more shut in.</p>
<p>These lockdowns are making people more sick. They close themselves off from normal germs and when they finally go back into society they get hit with multiple rather than building natural immunity all along the way.</p>

        <p>THIS. I brag about not having really followed any COVID protocol...I had ONE cold back about a month ago. Missed one day of work, had a fever. Drank a gallon and a half of water. Did day cold medicine powder drink. Ate a full jar of cornichons and drank the vinegar. Laid in the sun. Next day, did tons of water. Tons of sun. No fever. Still a smidge of a cough but not concerned.</p>
<p>We need to be out and about. The shutting in, coupled with overuse of sanitizers and antibacterials, is going to do a lot of harm down the road methinks.</p>

        <p>I got a cold a few weeks ago. I have asthma though so it was intense for me. Very hard to breathe and sore throat.  </p>
<p>I can see why covid could def be more dangerous for ppl with underlying conditions such as asthma.</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely. But for most people, they need to be out more. I was going to bars when they were only open outside because the lack of social interaction is a bigger detriment to my health.</p>

        <p>That's a good MD.  Your sister and her son are lucky.  Some prob would have said go get tested and if it's covid sorry he should have gotten the vaccine.</p>
