<p>Patients will only be informed what vaccine brand will be injected to them at the vaccine center <strong>IF</strong> they asked. Otherwise, information about the vaccine brand will not be given in advance.</p></p>

        <p>I am in the Philippines. The injections are not mandatory here. </p>
<p>A lawyer/politician filed a bill to make them mandatory in April, but I assume this was rejected as I haven't heard anything about it since.</p>
<p>Duterte then told a pack of lies a couple of weeks ago, one of which was that NOBODY has died because of the injections, to try to convince everybody that they are a terrible person if they don't get injected. </p>
<p>He has said that they won't be forcing people to get injected, but those who refuse to get injected should never leave their home...</p>

        <p>Should never leave their home? What does that mean? Can they still go out? Arent you guys heavily masked there too? You guys have hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromycin or ivermectin and zinc?</p>

        <p>It's just a threat/suggestion at this point. Only 1.1% of the population is 'fully vaccinated' here, so there are no policies stating that only fully vaccinated people can do x yet. </p>
<p>There are also a large number of people here who do not want the injections at all. </p>
<p>I believe the Philippines is the country with the highest percentage of people wearing masks in the world. If it's not THE highest, it is certainly one of the highest. Masks are required everywhere outside your own home and the punishment for not wearing one, or not wearing one properly, is being arrested and fined.</p>
<p>Face shields also need to be worn as well as masks in some areas. </p>
<p>Ivermectin is only available if prescribed by a doctor.  The others you mentioned should be more easily available as hydroxychloroquine is used for malaria and azithromycin can be purchased from most pharmacies.</p>

        <p>So have people been using hydroxychloroquine, antibiotic, and zinc as a treatment over there? How are "cases" over there? ( even tho PCR test is useless )</p>

        <p>I can only speak from personal experience and have no idea of the scale. I am also reliant on information coming from my wife as I am not Filipino.</p>
<p>She knows some people who are regularly taking Vitamin D and zinc. She knows a handful of people who are also taking ivermectin. I don't know how they are getting ivermectin, since a prescription is supposedly required to get it here.</p>
<p>There are about 6000-7000 new cases a day at present. But obviously, as you mentioned, these are meaningless because the PCR test is useless.</p>
<p>Workers are also mandated to take frequent tests, so  the number of people being tested each day is very high.</p>
<p>For example, my wife has to take a mandatory test every month and if she takes a sick day for ANY reason, she can't return to work without a negative test.</p>
