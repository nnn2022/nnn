    <strong>3 Things to take into account</strong>
    <p><p>Dear NNN members and all other members for that matter, interesting times will be ahead. As a father of two and a husband I was constantly anxious about the upcoming times. It gave me sleepless nights and a lot of stress. Seeing otherwise very skeptical people in my personal and work environment being brainwashed also has put quite a strain on these relationships. </p>
<p>I have reflected on the past 1.5 year and made an overview of what was beneficial vs what was harmful. This lead to the 5 points mentioned that I chose to live my life by. It helps me cope with these times and the times to come. Additional tips are more than welcome, I labelled this as discussion as well as good news.</p>
<ol>
<li>Expect the best, but be prepared for the worst.</li>
<li>Enjoy the current moment as much as you can.</li>
<li>Crazy times require creative solutions.</li>
<li>Stop trying to convince those who can't be convinced.</li>
<li>You are not fighting this battle alone!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Expect the best, but be prepared for the worst</strong><br>
If we all lay down and roll over because the situation seems hopeless. It probably will turn out his way. Watch the protest of millions of happy people all over the world. Humanity is uniting against the dystopian agenda. Don't flood yourself with negative thoughts and bad news. Visualize this all ending every  day, the collective mind of millions can manifest itself in reality.  </p>
<p>Do prepare however, if things take a turn for the worse it's good to have this covered. This doesn't mean digging a nuclear shelter in your backyard. Having 2 months of food/water at the very least and ensuring an alternative means of communication would be a very wise choice. Not just for the current situation, but in general.   </p>
<p><strong>Enjoy the current moment as much as you can.</strong><br>
Go outside, feel the sun on your skin. Hear the laughter of children. See the smiling faces of people enjoying themselves and the beauty of nature in full bloom. Even if things might take a turn for the worse in the (near) future. Don't let it affect your mood and the mood of others NOW. If you have children, take them outside play with them, talk with them. Every hour wasted reading dystopian news is an hour you could have spent with your loved ones. After all the things that truly make you happy, are often free of charge and available in abundance.  </p>
<p><strong>Crazy times require creative solutions.</strong><br>
You can't enter a cinema? Organize a movie night with friends/family. Make your own popcorn and add a theme to it.<br>
You can't enter a restaurant? Experiment with making new dishes yourself, have friends over to enjoy a meal together. Can be combined with the movie night as well.<br>
You can't travel? Look for places nearby that you haven't discovered yet. In your local area/country there are countless of beautiful places.<br>
Does shopping in a facemask/plastic world makes you anxious/sad? Shop with a group of  friends, while shopping you can talk and support each other. Also for the places that still have a mask mandate. People are less likely to confront you for going mask less if you do it as a group.</p>
<p><strong>Stop trying to convince those who can't be convinced</strong><br>
Right now, I sincerely believe a majority of the global population has been brainwashed. Not as an insult, but literally brainwashed. The cognitive dissonance is so strong ,that reasoning is no longer an option. Engaging in endless discussions with these people is very tiring as well as pointless. Don't hold it against them, some of us where like them before we saw through it. Don't play into their hand, by allowing a divide and conquer strategy to manifest. It's humanity VS evil, not humanity vs humanity.  </p>
<p><strong>You are not fighting this battle alone!</strong><br>
There are millions if not billions on your side. And these are not tin foil hat wearing nuts. These are doctors, lawyers, scientists, artists, politicians. The media will attempt to hide this from you and will try to manipulate you with false statistics or biased research. At the end of the day we are all humans and not machines. You are not alone in this. I'm on your side! Many of my friends and family are on your side! Don't let them bring you down, ever.   </p>
<p>What happens the next months, will determine the future of humanity. Will we continue to live in freedom or will we settle for a dystopian two-tier society?  Do your part, help others and NEVER  allow them to break you down. Good will win in the end, they have taken a lot from you and me, they probably will take more. But they can never take away our humanity. 2+2 will never be 5.   </p>
<p>Lots of love and wisdom from the Netherlands!</p></p>
