    <strong>Is anyone surrounded by vaccinated people?</strong>
    <p><p>If you are, can you please share your experience if you are unvaccinated. Do you feel any different/sick because of this shedding that’s possibly going on? Do you know anyone who said they feel weird? Please share because I’m concerned</p></p>

        <p>My wife has had her cycle screwed with 100%. She has tracked it for years on her phone and you can see the wild irregularity just this month. She had her period come a week early after hanging with a vax person. It lasted two weeks. Then the week it ended she had a shoot where she interviewed a vet who was vaccinated two days before. The next day my wife was bed ridden with the worst cramping of her life. I’ve never seen her like that, I wanted to bring her to the hospital but she asked for a neproxin and wanted to ride it out because she had another big shoot later that day. She believes the inflammation was caused from the shedding she was exposed to. </p>
<p>TLDR; wife had early, two week long period and extreme bed ridding cramps after hanging around va xx ed individuals</p>

        <p>I stayed with someone recently vaccinated for about a week, had a late/light period and then felt sick for about 2 weeks after. You can read more about it it my comment history but you’ll have to dig a little, most of my comments are sarcastic shitposts and arguments with trolls.</p>
<p>I’m finally starting to feel better. I’ve been staying home just in case it’s covid or something else transmissible but it doesn’t feel like any virus I’ve ever had. For context I think I had covid last year and a really bad flu about 10 years ago, other than that I never get anything worse than a cold and that’s only like once every 2 years.</p>

        <p>Mild but marked chest/abdomen pains, but still unsure if related to mom getting the shot. On the one hand she got it a month ago and chest pains only started a week ago. On the other hand, I have never had any chest pain before ever, never had any heartburn issues, and it now seems to go away when my mom’s away for a few days. Saw another guy’s post regarding chest pains and shedding as well. I don’t know what to think, I’m trying to figure out if maybe my diet has been different recently but unsure. Anxious to hear if anyone else has similar</p>

        <p>Yeah i watched one of ann vandersteel’s interviews with a doctor regarding the subject, vitamin c d selenium and zinc he said for immune function. I realized i definitely could be doing better on the veggies. Hoping this is just shedded spike protein and not ‘spreadable vaccines’ per se. Have you had any symptoms?</p>

        <p>Yeah if it were truly spreadable i would think the unvaxed would be getting full-on sickness, clots, etc, although some women definitely appear to be having serious effects through shedding re menstruation. I gotta believe it would still be less serious than if they actually took the shot</p>

        <p>Yes a hand on my chest is accurate and also it hurt to take actual deep breaths. Like I couldn't take a full breath of air or it would be painful. Very scary tbh. How long did it last for you?</p>

        <p>Fuck that doesn’t sound great. Deep breathing is okay for me but it’s been about 10 days without any real improvement. And does seem to be correlated with when my mom is home, however it only started a couple weeks after she got the shot</p>

        <p>I started work at a grocery store in suburban Detroit a little over two months ago. Cases at the time were “surging”, and we are administering vaccines. I’m 33, not on birth control, never have been. Not having sex, periods come like clockwork, short of the last two months. March and April my period was a week to TWO weeks early, and incredibly light and short. Not at all normal. (My first week someone received a J&amp;J shot in the pharmacy, immediately fainted, hit their head on the way down and was carried out on a stretcher, side note.) I’m not claiming causation, but certainly noticed correlation.</p>

        <p>There’s another theory going around that because vaccinated people are immune compromised, they’re catching covid and are spreading it too. You folks may have had covid and lesser symptoms. The shedding from anything other than a live virus vaccine doesn’t add up.</p>

        <p>Basically after being vaccinated someone can spread small amounts of the spike protein. This was confirmed by some of Pfizer's internal documents. But the idea that its dangerous is insanity. Even if you were in an orgy of the freshly vaccinated, you wouldn't be exposed to enough of the spikes to cause a low grade fever. Anyone reporting symptoms from being near the vaccinated are the same level of hypochondriacs as long covid nincompoops.</p>

        <p>YES! I can't confirm it, but the "coincidence" is plenty enough to make me take notice. I went on a date with a vaccinated person and got sick the very next morning. A week later I found out I had mono. I ended up in the hospital for two days. She's the only person I hung out with that was vaccinated and no one else I know ever got sick. So.... the math adds up, but I can't confirm anything beyond that. So I can't say for sure.</p>

        <p>My fiance got the vaccine a few weeks prior. We didn't notice anything change in her cycle, and I felt fine being around her. Nothing changed as far as I could tell between either of us. She had a headache the day after her shot and arm pain for half a week, but that was it as far as either of us could tell. Emotionally, I felt a little like a black sheep as the last one in my circle (friends AND family) unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>You completely misunderstand this sub or you didn't even take the time to look at anything and just assumed that's what this place is based on other sub reddits opinions. </p>
<p>We believe that covid is real. We don't believe that it even comes close to warranting the response it has in the form of lockdowns and forcible mask wearing. We also aren't anti vaxx. We are anti these vaccines because they are largely experimental and have shown a high rate of alarming short term side effects and theyre on their way to being forced on the public.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your honest response. That make sense.  </p>
<p>I guess I overreacted because of the amount of people talking about shedding. None of these vaccines contain live virus so shedding is simply impossible. </p>
<p>But also,  "high rate of alarming short term side effect" is simply not true. Vaccines are going for more than 6 months.  More than  259 mm doses were given to Americans with virtually no more side effect than 1 or 2 bad days. The only exception I remember is the 5 blood cloth cases from J&amp;j.</p>
<p>I hope this sub is able to keep the logical sense and read through what is happening. I understand not wanting to be the first 100 to take the vaccine. Maybe not the first 10,000. Maybe not the 1,000,000. But at this point with so many people vaccinated and living their life normally, I am  starting to think that people are against the vaccines simply because they don't want to change their position. </p>
<p>If the concern is  "but what about long term effect of the vaccine that maybe didn't showed up yet" ?? Well, no one seems to care or believe in long term effect from covid, so why would there be concerns for the vaccine.</p>

<p>That's just for Pfizers vaccine for reported side affects. You can search for the other 2 if you'd like.</p>
<p>Once you open the page scroll down the vaccine list until you find covid. It's alphabetical.</p>
<p>Edit: that link won't bring you directly to the page I thought it would because its form submission. Bit you can use that to search how many side affects have been reported.</p>
<p>158,735 adverse reactions out of 862,000 doses. Between the main 3. </p>
<p>1 in 8. That is substantial.</p>

        <p>Why do you say 800k doses? The Pfizer vaccine already had more than 140mm shots delivered. 158k/140mm is not 1 in 8. </p>
<p>Also, adverse reactions are expected on vaccination. It is literally  part of the disclaimer on any vaccine. You might have adverse reaction or side effects.</p>
<p>A light headache is an adverse reaction. Being tired is an expected reaction. This would be the same for most vaccines.  </p>
<p>What matters is if people are getting seriously ill or dying due to vaccine. And your data doesn't show any of that. Actually cdc is very clear on their site that there is no data showing any concerning issues. Only exception was the J&amp;j vaccines which is not even material enough to stop the roll out. </p>
<p>And at this point we have enough data to show for. At the level we are Globally in vaccination if there was something to be perceived it would have been seen a good time ago. Data continues to show that the vaccine is safe.</p>

        <p>Why don't you look at the data provided by the CDC web page that I linked to you instead of arguing with me. Compare it to the other vaccines. VAERS is CDC data. What I linked was the last updated info, at the time that was posted on the CDC website there was a 1 in 8 ratio for reaction between the three vaccines.</p>

        <p>In regards to concerns about long term effects from vaccine versus the virus. One thing I think about is if I get covid my body learns how to fight the spike protein. If I get three vaccine my body learns how to MAKE and fight the spike proteins. Leaves me a little concerned about what other types of spiky cells my body might decide to make. </p>
<p>Not to mention pharmaceuticals in general have a  history of causing unintentional long term side effects that you might not expect. Right now I'm more willing to take my chances with possible long term side effects from a virus.</p>
