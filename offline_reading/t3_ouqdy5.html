    <strong>What we have is a case of liars and a crap vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>Operating on the assumption that the vaccine does what it says it does (which is questionable) even with a 60% or so (right now they cite 95%) efficacy, there’s no way there would be this many breakthrough infections. I think their vaccine numbers are much, much lower than they publish. Look at the olympics. I think people are saying they’ve had the vaccine and not asked to present proof. So when they pop positive, oh, of course this athlete took the shot.……</p>
<p>Also, this is anecdotal, but a few of my very libby friends went back to our home state to “get the vaccine.” The one dose J&amp;J. Why not all go together? Two of them even volunteered at a vaccine clinic. Remember when all those videos were circulating where a health worker was “given the vaccine” and there was nothing in the syringe? </p>
<p>I think way more people are lying about it than we realize. I’d wager only about 30-40% have actually taken the vaccine.</p></p>
