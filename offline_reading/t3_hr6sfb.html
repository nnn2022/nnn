    <strong>Interdasting controlled study shows cloth mask wearers six times *more* likely to get viral infections. 2015 study</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;<em>A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<strong><em>Results</em></strong> <em>The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>Conclusions</em></strong> <em>This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.</em></p>

        <p>I'm just seeing it, and the other post I made from April's NEJM.</p>
<p>There's no reasoning with people any more. Frankly if they showed me compelling evidence that masks work, I still wouldn't wear one just because I don't want them to have that kind of control over me.</p>
<p>Back at the beginning I would have, before it became nasty and personal.</p>

<p>The only time doctors would be wearing a mask for hours normally would be during surgery.</p>
<p>Also healthcare workers with patient contact get sick all the time and they actually know how to don, wear, and doff PPE properly. It's a risk we knew about when we signed on.</p>

        <p>More likely to get viral infections... than N95 masks. But cloth masks, like surgical masks, are not intended to protect the wearer from infection. They are intended to protect those around you from infection <em>by</em> you when you don't know that you're infected. The majority of infections are caused by people that don't realize they are infected and are infecting others around them. Masks reduce that risk.</p>

        <p>You can't really have not read anything about this study, right?</p>
<p>From your link, the control group is "normal practice" not, "no masks", normal practice is:</p>
<p>&rt;Intervention Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks.</p>
<p>Every group, including the control group was wearing masks</p>
<p>&rt;The control arm was ‘standard practice’, which comprised mask use in a high proportion of participants. As such (without a no-mask control), the finding of a much higher rate of infection in the cloth mask arm could be interpreted as harm caused by cloth masks, efficacy of medical masks, or most likely a combination of both.</p>
<p>Your title claims that people are 6x as likely to get an ILI infection... but to who? The control group... which was still wearing some sort of mask, it just wasn't a cloth or medical mask. </p>
<p><strong>This study makes no judgement call on the use of cloth masks vs no mask. Only that a cloth mask is worse than either a medical mask or a non-cloth, non-medical mask</strong></p>

        <p>I don't believe there's any way to "force" mask compliance, nor do I really think there should be. I would just like everyone to see that the quickest path back to the things we enjoy in life involve making some short term sacrifices--like wearing a mask when you're in public. Other countries have figured this out and are having a more "normal" life these days than we do. </p>
<p>But as long as this virus poses the very real threat of overloading our healthcare system, we don't have the luxury of "personal responsibility". Your choices affect me, and mine affect you. This whole sub is about resisting the "new normal" I don't want a "new" normal either, I want to return to the non-pandemic life, and we get there faster with masks. I believe that all your guys' resistance prolongs the time til we can return to life.</p>

        <p>You still haven’t addressed the limitations presented in the very study you linked trying to show how cloth masks are dangerous and/or ineffective. Just trying to dispel misinformation that’s going to keep us all locked down longer than either of us want to be, but if you want to go about it the difficult way and believe that the entire world is in on this whole mask joke and you and your group of “free thinkers” are smarter than the majority of medical professionals based on nothing but misinterpretations of scientific studies and the occasional doctor who agrees with you, go ahead and be my guest.

<p>So here's some questions for you, I really really want to make the best mask possible:</p>
<p>What kind of cloth, cotton, nylon, rayon, wool? Is one of these fabrics more effective than any other? What weight of cloth? Does the weave of the cloth matter? What about dyed cloth, does the dye effect it's usefulness?</p>
<p>If they only work on the exhale, as I've been told I'm wearing a mask not to protect myself, but to prevent me from spreading it to others, can I wear the mask "inside out" and have it work to protect me on the inhale? How would the cloth in that case know which direction it's supposed to stop the virus?</p>
<p>While you're answering all these questions, here's some more:</p>
<p>I read people talk about "layers" - how many layers does the cloth mask have to be? Can I do one thick layer, or three thin layers, which one is more effective? How thin or thick should the layers be?</p>
<p>I've got a lot more questions about how to make a safe and effective homemade mask, but I'll give you time to answer these first.</p>

        <p>Do you really not understand how a piece of fabric in front of your mouth and nose is more effective at preventing excess droplets from flying into the air than it is at preventing all excess droplets in the air from coming in? It doesn’t work like a one-way filter so your bad faith question about how the mask will “know” which way it’s coming in is moot.</p>
<p>Covid is spread through droplets. Do an experiment for me. Breathe on your hand, feel it? Now put a piece of cloth between your hand, feel it again. You notice how you feel less heat and condensation? Those are droplets. Any mask will lessen the amount of droplets you spread into the air. It won’t be 100%, even medical masks. But 100% isn’t the goal, mitigating the amount of viral particles that any given person is breathing into the air is the goal. </p>
<p>Homemade masks aren’t 100%, but they do <em>reduce</em> the amount of potential viral particles that you both breathe in and breathe out. More layers will do more to reduce that amount. You’re needlessly throwing in all these bad faith questions about material and layers to complicate the issue. Yes there is an ideal homemade mask material and layer and sealant. But <em>any</em> piece of fabric will be a mitigation factor both ways. Full stop.</p>

        <p>People are making home-made masks by the millions. The government itself is encouraging and in many cases mandating that people wear masks, even of the home-made type.</p>
<p>These are legit questions for anyone who wants to make their own mask.</p>
<p>So tell me, how are my questions "bad faith" if I want to know what constitutes a mask that complies with these mandates, the mandates that you're telling me I need to comply with?</p>
<p>Tell me and the lurkers how to comply.</p>
<p>Maybe the lurkers you seem to want to educate would appreciate answers to these simple and - to a thinking adult - obvious questions about home-made masks. Here's your chance to really help society. </p>

        <p>Well he's sort of right on that point. Your example of breathing on your hand is "homemade science" but at the same time the study doesn't at all suggest that homemade masks are the equivalent or worse than wearing no mask at all.</p>

        <p>This study is useful in its context, if you are a hospital worker in a high-risk environment, deciding between a cloth mask and a medical mask, a medical mask is clearly a better choice.</p>
<p>What this study doesn't do is provide evidence that cloth masks are ineffective in non-clinical environments.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that in non-clinical environments, people don't wear masks to protect themselves. People wear masks because they don't want to unknowingly spread the virus to others. It's been well documented that cloth coverings do reduce asymptomatic transmission.</p>

<p>&rt;<em>People wear masks because they don't want to unknowingly spread the virus to others.</em></p>

<p>Hey, here's some questions:</p>
<p>Cloth masks only? What kind of cloth, cotton, nylon, rayon, wool? Is one of these more effective than any other? What weight of cloth? Does the weave of the cloth matter? What about dyed cloth, does the dye effect it's usefulness?</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm debating the issue to see if there is a convincing argument against masks</p>
<p>So your starting point is that everything the government says you should do is legit and should be obeyed, unless someone comes up with an argument against it?</p>
<p>That's like opposite town. The person or entity forcing you to do something against your will should justify it.</p>

        <p>The Federal government has mostly been telling me not to wear a mask, but they've gone back and forth, I'm mostly trying to sift through the science at this point.</p>

        <p>&rt; It's been well documented that cloth coverings do reduce asymptomatic transmission.</p>
<p>Do you have any of the well documentation in non-clinical environments?  Because I highly doubt it.</p>

        <p>Yep, you can take a look at several of the studies cited here: <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</a>  </p>
<p>There's even a newer study that shows some evidence that wearing masks also reduces the wearer's risk: <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/your-mask-cuts-own-risk-65-percent/">https://www.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/news/your-mask-cuts-own-risk-65-percent/</a></p>
