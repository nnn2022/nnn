    <strong>West Virginia longterm care residents received their first doses mid-December and many starting receiving their second dose a few days ago. So why are they still dying?</strong>
    <p><p>West Virginia has the best vaccination rate in the country. This is despite the fact they are the only state in the country not part of the federal vaccination pharmacy distribution program. Or maybe it's because of that fact.</p>
<p>Regardless, they tested their longterm care homes first and frequently, and they have always really focused on trying to reduce elderly deaths. It's easy to get a test in this state no matter who you are.</p>
<p>But new outbreaks are still occurring and people are still dying. It's clear to me that the first dose is likely not effective at all, meaning this push elsewhere to give everyone one dose is just political posturing.</p>
<p>However... you would expect a slight decline in this state even if it's not fully in effect. Why is the state (along with Connecticut that has also had success vaccinating longterm care homes) one of the top in deaths in the last few days?</p>
<p>Two days ago, I heard that a new outbreak occurred at a facility in a nearby county. Residents and staff are tested twice a week even if employees only work one day a week. They tested a staff member and realized they were positive, and then they tested more people and realized there was an outbreak.</p>
<p>They had an earlier outbreak in April that was rather small (can't remember all the numbers except the deaths), but as soon as I read this latest news I looked at the data on the state's dashboard. In the last outbreak, one person died. But in two days with 21 infected patients, there have already been four deaths.</p>
<p>Remember: this facility is tested twice a week! So not only did it go through like a firestorm, but this occurred weeks after the first vaccine dose. Definitely didn't reduce symptoms.</p>
<p>It makes you think.</p></p>

        <p>Most of the time, it's not even sad. Its a blessing. Quality of life gets pretty nil and theyve already lived 20 years longer than the average person.</p>

        <p>This. </p>
<p>The reason we are in this mess is Western denialism of the essential nature of death.</p>
<p>It's not a curse, it's a blessing. </p>
<p>Death is when suffering ends.</p>
<p>It should not be sought out because life too is a blessing and not one to be squandered but it should not be a reason to live in fear either.</p>
<p>We will all die. </p>
<p>This is how the universe works and no fantasy of masks, social distancing, and lockdowns will ever change this simple fact. </p>
<p>Death is supposed to be sad for those who will miss you but in societal terms? It's nothing. It never was.</p>
<p>Nobody held candlelit vigils for flu victims or clapped for cancer patients because we knew this deep down until the media and big tech convinced idiots to dwell in fear instead.</p>

        <p>They shouldnt be giving these lethal, liability-free, experimental drugs that admittedly have nothing to do with any virus, much less one never proven to exist, to the elderly.  That's attempted murder.</p>
