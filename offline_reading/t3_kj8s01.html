        <p>This graph is quite interesting, it shows how the coronavirus has killed relatively few people per month, per million people, in Sweden. I'm not sure what the data for the rest of the world is like, but let's assume it follows this pattern. On the graph, the peak deaths per month per million is 1.25 times that of the coronavirus. Notice how the y-axis begins at 500, making it appear that the coronavirus is inconsequential and that the Beijing flu had a number several times higher, but in reality, is only 25% higher. At 1993, Sweden's population was 8.7 million, now it's 10.2 million, an increase of around 23%, so the coronavirus has killed a similar number of people. 2 things to keep in mind: 1. These numbers aren't applicable to other countries, who probably have more coronavirus cases right now compared to the Beijing flu, 2. The coronavirus pandemic was still ongoing at Oct. 7th when this data was taken, the average deaths per month has gone up since then.</p>

        <p>To your point 1, the numbers are not applicable to all countries, this is true. Yet Sweden is a good control case because they have had comparatively light restrictions, no lock downs, no mask mandates and low voluntary adoption of masks. In other countries, it's possible that lockdowns themselves may be killing people via mental health effects, cancellation of medical procedures etc. By picking a non-lockdown and non-mask country, this is ruled out.</p>
<p>To your point 2, the average deaths per month has not gone up since the graph was taken. Far from it, in fact https://www.statista.com/statistics/1115707/sweden-number-of-deaths-per-week/</p>
<p>To your last points, the data matters because we are experiencing nothing unprecedented yet, we take unprecedented actions, make unprecedented infringements on rights and are shutting down entire sectors of the economy.  This will be far, far more damaging than a virus which is, I reiterate, not unprecedented in its impact. </p>
<p>Finally, I pick Sweden because they did not lockdown, and they have no mask mandates. So we do not need to account for any positive benefits that lock-downs may be having.
 With that said, I can also cite several studies which show no, or negligible benefits from lockdowns and other studies which show no, or negligible benefits from masks. I don't have these right at hand, or I would list these now, but I will post if you'd like.</p>
<p>Edit: My apologies, but it it late where I am and I need to work tomorrow. I would stay up and continue to reply to you otherwise but as it is I'll have to reply to any further responses you may have, tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply! I take it that your argument is that the lockdowns are far too extreme. With your example, Sweden, you say that they have relatively inconsequential restrictions. </p>
<p>But if Sweden had relatively few restrictions yet still had relatively few deaths, does that not mean that they weren't prone to massive amounts of death in the first place? That is to say, because of low population density, relatively small number of international flights, etc., Sweden wasn't going to get affected much by this pandemic even without lockdowns (which is what happened). So, I'd say that these looser restrictions were appropriate in Sweden's case.</p>
<p>However, like you said, these numbers aren't applicable to other countries, who have far more deaths (and importantly, projected deaths), than the Beijing flu. Thus, using Sweden to say that 'the Beijing flu was a worse pandemic than the coronavirus' is unfair. If you looked another country (even with tough lockdown restrictions), let's say the United States, you'd see that, 1. Deaths have increased significantly since October, 2. There is a big difference between Beijing flu deaths and coronavirus deaths.</p>
<p>Now, despite what I've said, if you can provide studies showing that lockdowns and mask use is ineffective, that would effectivenely refute</p>

        <p>I will link the papers for you, but I want to say a few things first.</p>
<ul>
<li>We were originally sold lock-downs on the idea that this pandemic would be much worse than any virus since the Spanish flu. It had to be sold this way because the measures we are taking now are <em>far</em> more extreme and far more disruptive than any pandemic control measures which have been implemented ever in history. For blatant violations of civil liberties and forced closures of entire sectors of the economy to be justified, this virus would have to be more than just a little worse than anything experienced in the last 50 years. So, while it is possible that Sweden got off relatively easy for some intrinsic reasons, the fact that they are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/525353/sweden-number-of-deaths/">poised to have just slightly higher deaths</a> in 2020 than in 2018 tells me that it is highly unlikely that <em>any</em> country could have seen the scale of deaths and damage necessary to justify what has happened. This is of course assuming that lockdowns have a positive effect beyond the damage they cause to begin with, and the studies I am about to post will contradict this.</li>
<li>Second, if there is anything intrinsic to Sweden (as opposed to policy decisions) which caused it to have relatively fewer deaths you would probably have to look to demographics and average health rather than population density because sero-prevelance rates of Sweden are not any lesser than what other countries are seeing (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.20185017v1.full.pdf). Although this is an older study it is the best I could find for a summary of many countries in one place. And, maybe you will want to argue something about population density relationship to viral load, but this is starting to sound like wishful thinking, and you will see that the studies I am about to post (which looked at factors influencing the death rates) found no such relationship.</li>
<li>Third, since I am comparing Sweden to Sweden, it is completely fair to say that there are recent pandemics which have been worse. Whatever mitigating factors may be applicable to Sweden now, were likely applicable 30 years ago. And while I'm aware that different pandemics affect different countries differently according to semi-random factors like fluctuations in the size of the vulnerable population, if you look at historical death rates for different countries you will see that countries tend to each take their turns over 10-15 year periods at having larger than normal flu-season death spikes. So, while the Beijing flu might not have affected Germany, for instance, as much as it did Sweden you can bet that Germany had its own similar death spike in a different year (I specifically choose Germany instead of USA because the much larger size of USA and demographic diversity among states tends to make these sort of events wash-out to a degree). Now of course you will want to point out that USA has significantly (although not massively) more deaths this year than anything in the last 50, but it is not a fair comparison because the extreme lockdowns in USA may be causing the difference in
 deaths themselves (and I believe that this is a better explanation according to all the evidence). </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, here are the studies I've been referring to:</p>

</ul>
<p>Edit, forgot mask studies:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</li>
<li>Not published in a scientific journal, but data is accurate and I'm posting anyway due to a dearth of non-mechanistic mask studies: https://rationalground.com/post-thanksgiving-mask-charts-still-no-evidence-that-masks-work/ , https://rationalground.com/interactive-tool-masks-covid-19/ , https://rationalground.com/the-human-studies-cited-by-the-cdcs-recent-scientific-brief-do-not-support-community-masking/</li>
