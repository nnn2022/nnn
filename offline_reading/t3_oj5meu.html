    <strong>Are we witnessing the end of humanity?</strong>
    <p><p>Cause it really feels so, these past 2 years have geniunely felt like a bad dream to me I just can't believe what has happened and honestly I may never fully comprehend it, sometimes when I sleep I have dreams of the world before 2020 then I wake up and I am close to crying.</p>
<p>What happened to the world, to us and everything, I can't recognise anything, I don't feel like I am in the same world that was before 2020, it's like we are in an different dimension, hell even after years like 2012 and 2016 , the world has been going to shit in the last decade.</p>
<p>I can't wrap my head around the mass propanga happening throught this whole thing, there hasn't been anything before to this scale, and I am even more dumbfouned that most people are actually buying it, Does no seriously question this thing outside of this sub, I just don't know.</p>
<p>I feel like this is the end and we can't do anything about it, who knows what will happen to all the vaxxed in a few years, and with talks of the vaccine becoming mandatory, I don't think anyone is making it unvaccinated out of this.</p>
<p>So I guess this really is it, I am only glad I got to have my childhood before the world went mad, but I do really feel bad for today's kids.</p>
<p>Anyways we are living in the most terryfing of times and we will fight till the end, it's good I found this subreddit, let's hope we last a little bit more.</p>
<p>I wish all of you guys well and let's live the remainder of our lives as best and free as we can.</p></p>

        <p>Same. I’d rather die of Covid or be beheaded than put the dead baby vax in my body. Luciferase. No thank you. I will stick with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Almost everyone I know has caved to this thing. You are correct. The world has gone mad. Up is down, black is white. Hold fast and stay strong my friend.</p>

        <p>I don't want to get COVID, but I have a personal conviction that God has given me not to partake of any technology that is manufactured with or tested on aborted fetal tissue.</p>
<p>I would never take an mRNA vaccine but even if I wanted to I couldn't because of the moral implications. </p>
<p>These people want everyone to partake in their evil plan. I will not.</p>

        <p>If the shot is the mark of the beast it will never be mandated, there will always be a way out of it. It may not be a pleasant way out but there will be a way to avoid it. They harder they push it the more it seems that it is or that future boosters will be. One religious scholar has said it will be the 7th shot which is the actual mark. In a way that makes sense. By the time they get to shot 7 everyone will have been given many chances to realize what has been going on. </p>
<p>BTW I had covid and it’s nothing like the adverse events from the jab. I would gladly have COVID again to save my soul from eternal damnation.</p>

        <p>We are witnessing the end of a chapter of humanity. The internet has brought a new age. It has led up to this moment. What's happened has happened.</p>
<p>What happens next is up to us (as a global society of citizens).
If we fall for this ploy, we can expect a two tier society - where people like you and me will be outcasts. We won't just vanish, I imagine we'll have our own communities.</p>

        <p>I think there's no doubt things are rapidly changing, but it's far from over. There is a lot of money being put towards making people question their sanity, to make them feel alone in their crackpot theories, to turn the public against them, and to censor any damning criticism. The reality seems that we are not as alone as the internet would lead you to believe.</p>
<p>There are thousands of doctors and government officials around the world speaking out against these mandates, and the people who are behind the vaccine push and their media mouthpieces are scrambling to keep a firm hold on public opinion. Once one makes up their mind to refuse this vaccine, they're unlikely to change their mind back. More and more people can only wake up to how sinister all of this is, this will accelerate the more dystopian it gets.</p>
<p>With the propaganda comes the demoralizing of the disobedient. They want to give you a sense of powerlessness. The best we can do is be persistent, and try not to let the madness cause you to give up hope and lose your drive.</p>
<p>Hang in there!</p>

        <p>People thought they were witnessing the end of the world in the 1940's.  </p>
<p>Throughout human history, every 50-100 years the world turns to shit for a chaotic period.  Millions die.  Than things come back together again.  </p>
<p>We're entering that period now.  This is just the beginning.  Be prepared.  Make right with God in case you don't make it out the back end.  But extinction or the "end of humanity" is unlikely.</p>

        <p>This is the most bizarre time in history.  I feel like no one is paying attention or gives a shit.  Yet it’s probably more just censorship so we think we’re alone.  I hope I’m wrong but the world is about to have massive economic collapse and the next piece of the agenda is going to be implemented.  Just look who is running this country, he should be eating jello in a nursing home, watching re runs of Matlock</p>

        <p>My experience with most of my family and friends is that they are not paying attention AND don't give a shit. A few of them are exhausted from worrying about it and are moving on with their lives as best they can. They don't want to talk about it anymore and I understand that. 
I have lots of new local people that I found and they are both paying attention and fighting. It was incredibly nice to find them. They are mostly parents fighting to get masks off and stop mandatory jabs. They are preparing to homeschool or have already started.</p>

        <p>Honestly, it’s my personal belief that we are living in the final stages of this sin blighted world. Prophecies are being fulfilled at a rapid rate before our eyes. Look at all the hatred and perversion that’s been normalized in society. All that’s left is for climate change laws to be implemented and for a global day of rest to be mandated to stop this climate change(mark of the beast)</p>

        <p>Did you see the article will they will be modifying SMS so you if text someone about Covid 19, it will not go through. Certain keywords will make it so you can't send the message. I assume Vaccine,  HydroChlor, Iver, Covid 19, Coronavirus, Hoax, Propaganda, Fauci, Biden, Harris, etc. Just opens the door for them to make other restrictions to text messaging.</p>

        <p>It’s crazy out there but we are far from the majority. There is massive resistance across the world, but you’re not going to see this on msm. Try to find some anti lockdown/medical freedom groups on Facebook and get involved. It feels a lot easier if you have people around you who see through this. Good luck. Stay strong.

And there are large pools of dissenters, who, until this day were just minding their own business and even ignoring the injustice around them, but who now find themselves among the resistance simply because of governments putting their heavy boot at everyone at the same time and not leaving the people any sane choice but struggle against them.</p>
