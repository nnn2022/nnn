    <strong>Work-at-homers: Do you feel like your productivity is declining?</strong>
    <p><p>I know not everyone is the same: some people find that their quality of life has improved by not being forced to go to the office, but some (like me) find the opportunity for distractions to be deleterious to productivity and morale.</p>
<p>One thing that has irked me on a fundamental level is the realization that my employer has benefitted from the pandemic. I even told my supervisor that I feel like a vegan working in a slaughterhouse. This dissonance between my values and the people I work for has made my interiorly unstable; I wish I could just walk away from it all. At this point, being sent to prison would feel like a mercy.</p></p>
