    <strong>It's hard not to hate the doomers</strong>
    <p><p>I just heard we (the Netherlands) are going in lockdown tomorrow.
Decided to look for some articles online and people are soooo goddamn happy that we are finally going into lockdown.
I have seen people posting stuff like: they should introduce a reward system where you can tell the police about people not wearing a mask and you get extra points and with enough points you get extra privileges.
And : people not following the guidelines should be put somewhere in a locked down area outside of society so we can all follow the guidelines and beat corona
And: it should be possible to call cps on anti mask parents
And: if you still go and celebrate christmas with your family you deserve to get sick.</p>
<p>It is getting harder and harder not too hate the other side. My dad was just telling me how it was okay for police to look inside your house to see if you are following the guidelines cause they can also storm your house if you do any other illegal thing so this is fine too and my sister was telling me if we all went into lockdown and everyone followed the rules we would finally beat corona and we would be back to normal in february.</p>
<p>I don't want to hate the other side. I don't want to walk around with all this anger, but b***... what the fuck is going on. How is nobody seeing through the bullshit.
How can I not get through to people. How do people think this is okay? </p>
<p>My daughters school is closing yet again. I'm gonna quit working for a few weeks/months as well (I'm a nurse, we don't have shit to do anyway) and I'm gonna do a lot of fun activities with my daughter
 We are gonna go for a walk on the beach (yes I know it is winter) we are going for long walks with the dog. We are going to plan a movie night for her friends who's parents aren't scared shitless etc etc. </p>
<p>The government is not taking my daughters youth from her.</p></p>

        <p>It's the same in Belgium, people are snitching on each other and all are applauding those who do this.
They are all ok with the lock downs and (illegal) curfews.</p>
<p>If you repead it long enough they start to believe it's for their own good.</p>

        <p>I don't get it either. Even if I were truly scared of this virus (which I'm not), I still wouldn't be begging for a lockdown. The people who are scared can wear masks, social distance, not see friends or family and do takeout and grocery pickup if they want. They can do all of that without a lockdown. I'm assuming that the pro lockdown people just want everyone else to be miserable along with them. Or they think that if we aren't in lockdown, then people will go around licking each other and coughing directly in people's mouths.</p>

        <p>To be fair, without the lockdown I would definitely go around licking other people.</p>
<p>But seriously though, I think they really believe that we will eraticate corona with a lockdown. And if everyone follows the rules we will be corona free ina month. These people are dillusional</p>

        <p>They have gone as far to spy on people with the street cameras if you are carrying too many pizzas you can expect a visit of the gestapo
They will use drones with heat cams to check with how many people are inside or in the garden.
Police doesn't need a warrant anymore if they suspect that tjere are too many people inside.
How more crazy does it have to be</p>

        <p>I really want to have faith in others. I do. I'm an idealist, and I don't want to write humanity off as irredeemable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, people keep doing things that hurt me, or I see how it hurts others. Often this stuff is celebrated by our peers as well, as long as it happens to others they hate. I even see this on here, with people basically trashing the elderly and the obese because they are "at fault". I feel like the light at the end of the tunnels dims more and more for me as I get older. I've found little peace in life, and my life continues to spiral downwards.</p>

        <p>As a psychologist I can tell you exactly why and it's not popular: we're conditioned by the state to worship authority at all angles. Eventually willpower atrophies like a muscle that's never used. This is exactly what obvious shit to a self-aware person will create cognitive dissonance when a seemingly-intelligent adult sabotages themselves and everyone around them while insisting it's the optimal method.</p>
<p>Those who can't, will always make sure you can't either.</p>

        <p>The same Belgium that has the highest COVID-19 per capita death rate among all countries in the world? Yeah, I'd say they're by now pointedly fed up with imbecilic harbingers of death like you. But I'm glad you seem to be flaunting restrictions. With luck, you'll be dead soon, and further pad Belgium's numbers as the most pitiful country (even more pathetic than Trump's America), utterly unable to govern itself and stop the idiot element of society -- you -- from doing grievous damage to everyone else.</p>

        <p>It's not news. It's the consensus of the <a href="https://www.johnsnowmemo.com/">vast majority of scientists across the world</a>. Are you even remotely aware that your view of reality is just as warped and demented as alien abduction crazies? Probably not. Odds are you're a senile boomer, your brain is half-rotten, and you don't understand much of anything. Sad.</p>

<p>Assuming you are right and we are wrong - is this really how you want to discuss things? Just two parties blindly hating and insulting each other? You think this is how we're gonna solve every crisis from now on, by bullying the other side into retreat?</p>

        <p>Nice appeal to authority. So we should stop thinking because some people tell us to have blind faith instead?</p>
<p>It's unknown how many scientists there are. Do you have any evidence that the amount of scientists is much less than 8400? 8400 seems like a pretty low number to be the maximum amount of scientists on the entire Earth.</p>
<p>Do all those scientists have proper credentials? This may seem surprising to people used to just having blind faith in whatever scientists say without knowing what's going on at all, but scientists have different fields in which they are scientist. For example, a scientist in physics could be a layman when it comes to viruses and health. Would you want to blindly copy his beliefs on health just because he's a scientist in an unrelated field? I've checked the list and many of those people either do not list their credentials or have the wrong credentials.</p>
<p>Do you know who made that list? Why do you trust him to be honest and capable of filtering out trolls (e.g. people who make up credentials or submit credentials of other people)?</p>
<p>You're demanding that we stop thinking and start having blind faith in those names. A little bit of actual evidence ought to not be too much to request in return.</p>

Once you have wished death or illness on another you have completely invalidated anything meaningful you might have contributed. Are you not intelligent enough to see that?</p>

        <p>Here in Germany it‘s even worse, we‘re in lockdown since November and the cases are still rising, ofc they prolonged the lockdown till at least mid January (after promising it would be over at the end of November, lol). Politicans are openly promoting to snitch on your neighbours if you think that they have more people than allowed at home, and call on intelligence surveillance of anti-lockdown protesters. A few days ago, there was a news article that one of those protesters got covid and is now in hospital, the doomers who are constantly virtue signaling about death numbers were celebrating it and saying that it hit „the right one“, or that he shoulnd’t be treated at all for his „false opinion“.</p>
<p>I have no problem if someone has a different opinion on covid and wants to protect himself with masks or self-isolation, its up to you what risks you are willing to take and how you live your life. But those who advocate authoritarian measures like mass surveillance of critics and dehumanize the other side for their views on covid policies really disgust me</p>

<p>Same here. I really don't care if you want to wear a mask, stay inside your home, not visit family etc. And I will (I'm a nurse) still take care of you and your loved ones if you do get sick. But this snitching on neighbours, laughing at people who do get covid, it's so toxic. Just don't, what the fuck is wrong with you people</p>

        <p>At this point, it‘s basically a cult, and the non-believers/sinners have to be punished and deserve no empathy whatsoever. Just questioning the policies makes you already not worthy of being treated like a human being anymore, and yet somehow we are the ones who lost their mind and can‘t accept different opinions</p>

        <p>I would not worry about the news article too much. The news frequently lies. In the NEtherlands one of the biggest few news papers (likely even the biggest) actually used to be a Nazi propaganda channel. That's the kind of corporations that the people choose to have blind faith in. No wonder we're getting screwed by a fake pandemic and mass hysteria over nothing.</p>

        <p>People keep claiming everyone with those opinions are bots.</p>
<p>I see this logic repeated in real life. I see the insane, fearful behavior from the pro-mask and pro-lockdown supporters. I really don't think this is all bots. Many, many people do seem to actually support this. Hell, look into the history of the Nazis. There were no bots back then, only gullible, stupid, selfish assholes.</p>

        <p>Same here, I'm getting more and more depressed to see how easy it was to change society and pretend snitching on others, wishing death upon people who didn't buy the Corona story is being on the good side. 
Everyday I go out without a mask and the few people I pass put their mask back on or even change sides or Insult me when they see me. 
I own a restaurant and some customers who are lucky enough to work from home and still earn a salary (I don't for nearly 6 months now) have the audacity to tell right in my face that I shouldn't be open, that I'm a danger to society and that all restaurants should be closed for at least 6 more months. 
So yeah pretty hard not to hate them... 2020 has definitely killed my faith in humans</p>

        <p>&lt;3 I'm here with you. (also Dutch)</p>
<p>Yes, it's diabolical. It's absurd. It's beyond all reason.</p>
<p>I sometimes struggle with contempt and disgust, especially since the mandated masks. I think it's disgusting to force your own hypochondriac delusion on other people. I think it's both cowardly and tyrannical at the same time. I think it shows some poor character traits.</p>
<p>I remind myself that I shouldn't fall into their trap, to not do the same... to not hate those on the opposing  side. They think they're doing the right thing. I don't hate them as people, and I want us to unite, as this is all highly divisive.</p>
<p>I try to see it as a test of sorts. Hate leads to misery for both myself and others, so I don't feed into it. I feel my anger, my rage, my disgust (for this tyranny) and also my fear (all reason has left this place, apparently) but try to find inner peace. They can't control that....</p>
<p>But I get it. It's incomprehensible, it's SUCH a crime...!!! Just yet, when the news broke, I could cry with anger. It's so horrible and wrong.</p>
<p>And heh, guess what? Your posts mentions people supporting a tyrannical regime where all remotely sane people are isolated outside of society.... you know what? Bring it on. I've had enough of this madness and enough of living in this crazy-making prison. Let the doomers live amongst themselves while they huddle inside out of fear for a mild cough, while we live happily and safely outside.</p>
<p>Hang in there. We're being told that we're crazy and evil, but we're not. YOU are not.</p>

        <p>Thanks so much for your comment. It is so nice to realise there are other dutch people who are sick of this as well. I know they are out there though.</p>
<p>You are right when you say they can't control your inner peace. I'm the one that chooses how this affects me.
They can't control my thoughts. My mind is still free.
That's why I'm going to stay home from work as much as possible during this lockdown. I'm going to show my daughter that we are still free. We'll go into the woods and climb some trees, just for fun, we'll go to the playground and see who can go highest on the swings, we'll go for a ride on our bikes and discover new places. And we'll do some old dutch games like spijkerpoepen, ezeltje prik and koekhappen. To remind her we are still those down to earth dutchies who aren't too bothered by all the panic. Doe maar normaal dan doe je al gek genoeg.</p>

<p>In my history class we laughed at the morons who thought hiding under a desk would help them survive a <em>nuclear bomb</em>. Keep in mind these people thought that the atomic bomb was the most destructive thing. They were clueless about the devastation of a nuclear bomb.</p>
<p>I wonder, depending on how the history books are written, will they look at people now, thinking a flimsy mask is some kind of saving grace.</p>

        <p>Depends who will write history.
The way it looks now, all the people who stayed home during this 'pandemic' and all the people who wore a mask will go down as heroes in the history books. The new generation of war veterans. The people our grandchildren will look up to. They will tell us how brave these people were. They wore a piece of fabric on their face and locked themselves inside their home for months and months on end without seeing another living soul, vraving anoter humans touch. A lot of them didn't even make it, they went insane and comitted suicide. Ofcourse we also had the nazis (antimaskers) they ruined the entire economy and killed grandmas, it was a dark dark time.</p>

My husband and I will have these lovely enlightening conversations with his mother, she'll be on the phone with her friends and family warning them against governement/corporate overreach, then she watches the news and goes back to "DeAdLy ViRuS!!!!" mode. Like a switch in her brain is just flipped.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly. I honestly thought I had one person convinced back in October... not only did she ‘reset’ the next day... she’s now afraid to leave her house. I fear things are actually getting worse. It’s bizarre.</p>

        <p>That's because they're coming from an emotional place, not a logical one. Anytime you have a "controversial" opinion that goes against the norm you'll have people violently disagree with you, logic be dammed. You can present the evidence and they will simply refuse to accept it and argue.</p>

<p>But goddamn it's so hard not to feel annoyed when the people I know trip over themselves running to the covid testing centre because they had a sniffle. How do they not understand that positive tests for people who aren't sick is the way the govt excuses locking down?</p>
<p>If people would stop getting tested over a sniffle and a slightly raised temperature we wouldn't be in his mess.</p>

        <p>A cold recently swept through my circle, and affected mostly teens and a couple parents like me. I happened to need a covid test while I had the cold so that I could get a medical procedure, and was negative. I had to convince my ex to not get our son tested when he got cold symptoms a few days later. One mom raced her teen in for flu/covid testing when he got sick (both negative), and made her family wear masks and skip school while waiting in terror for the results - I'd likely gotten my "verified" cold from THEIR family, so it was incredibly unlikely he'd have Covid. Another teen in the group told all his friends that he "almost definitely had Covid" - guess what, negative. I told another parent his results, and she said "oh thank God!". I mean, WHAT? We all have colds! Everyone tested negative! What a waste.</p>

        <p>The media is so corrupt. Don't even read those articles. It's literally propaganda. Today the government leaks the new lockdown measures to the media before they officialy announce it and coincidentally NOS (a media group sourced by the government a.k.a our taxy money) polled if people want a new lockdown. You can already guess whats coming next: 7/10 people support new lockdowns and think they are nessecary.</p>

        <p>Umm...what if people actually think about it and genuinely believe that masks are essential for this world? Doesn't that defeat your point? I got used to wearing a mask whenever I go to places that require them. It is actually quite comfortable if you don't always think about it. I don't blame anyone for having an opinion since we live in a world where you are allowed to say what you think without having to worry about being executed for it. But just listening to the government, even if you disagree with their decisions, makes life so much easier.</p>

        <p>This has shown us who people are. I've lost respect for so many people, and it seems many of those same people have lost respect for me. I had trouble making friends and connecting to people before this, so to lose most of my social circle in one year because I believe in freedom and/or different politics than they do has been sickening to say the least.</p>

There will be war of some kind of we're pressed enough... But it sounds to me as if in countries like yours you would be the tiny minority resistance. Are you even allowed to have guns?</p>

        <p>Nope, we don't have guns. But I have to say I'm glad we don't. If someone ever gets shot her it is big news, it rarely happens and if it does it is only by criminals, we never had a school shooting and nor will we ever. </p>

        <p>That doesn't really make sense though because not having your own weapons means you have to rely on other people to defend you. People can always find ways to kill people but what is the best way to defend yourself if someone tries to kill you? If not your own weapon, then you're stuck depending on someone else. The problem in America isn't that there's too many guns, it's that there aren't enough people with guns and the wrong people with guns. I've lived in places like Alaska, and everybody you see has a gun, and anyone who would want to do a shooting would be up against many more guns than he has time. The ability to kill weak unarmed targets has nothing to do with the weapon and everything to do with the unarmed targets. Everyone should have a gun, and know how to shoot it. That's the only way you can have your life in your OWN hands.</p>

        <p>I hear you. I struggle with this too. I try to tell myself that a lot of those people are just brainwashed, and blaming them takes the blame away from the real culprit. Some of them are asocial nutcases who take advantage of this situation. It’s pretty surprising what’s going on in Europe. You’d think all that self flagellating of WWII stuff would have prevented authoritarianism from happening, but I guess the opposite happened. “We are good and we CARE so this is for your GOOD”. It’s exactly the same formula that we have seen over and over again in history. I sort of feel lucky that I’m in US, even tho we have the craziest doomers and the worst corruption (in the west)ever, but at least SOME people are still real Americans. Liberty over safety, defiance of fascist government. We need to come together as people, across the world and not let them blindside us. You are not alone, make others speak. I’m sure there are plenty of people there who hate this too. They’re just being quiet about it. It’s time to stop being quiet. It will be the demise of the free world. The next few years to come it’s all about standing for truth, even if it goes against the popular beliefs.</p>

        <p>I understand why people are quite. It can cost you your job to go against the narrative. I'm a nurse, I don't get involved in anything corona related at work, I keep quiet. And I also keep quiet around other people, I have a daughter and I don't want to become an outcast on her behalf. If it was just me I would be out protesting this bullshit every day</p>

        <p>I try to talk to people but they are so quick with their responses and I'm not, mainly because of my autism, I need more time to process. So I always fuck up every discussion I have. Then I get frustrated to the point of losing it and I lose all respect for the person I'm talking too.</p>
<p>To be honest I don't even want to know whatpeople think about all of this. Cause we have a lot of sheep here, blissfully asleep. And I'm at the point where I want to cut all of them out of my life. But that would mean 99% of the people I know.</p>

        <p>This is my struggle also. Logically, I know that the only hope of this changing is by every single restaurant owner, store owner, hairdresser etc to just thumb this dystopia, and at the very least be calm with those on the "other side" when it comes to trying to get them to see the light, but it's extremely difficult when it seems pretty clear that a large percentage of them only come to this sub, or hundreds of other locations out in the world, with the sole intention of just bullying and attacking people.</p>

        <p>This shit really baffles me. I came from Malaysia to study in the Netherlands. I would expect the politicians here to be more level headed and logical but HELL I was dead wrong. Malaysia pretty much lifted the restriction and Netherlands is imposing another total lockdown which will have devastating effects undoubtedly. I truly feel for all the restaurant owners who are forced to close up.</p>

        <p>There is only one politician so far who is somewhat waking up (thierry baudet) but it took him a while as well. I never expected this behaviour from my fellow dutchmen. They aren't just okay with the lockdown and masks, they are asking for it, begging for it, welcoming it with open arms. I'm so disgusted by them I can't even put it into words</p>

        <p>I really hope there will be more people object this lockdown and force to reverse or at least relax the restriction. The politicians shouldn’t be paid as long as the lockdown is imposed so that they feel the financial strains of the others. They’ll lift then lift the restrictions in no time</p>

        <p>If it's any consolation, growing up with a wingnut schizoid as a father is doing <em>much</em> more damage to your daughter than the lockdown will. I'm glad that you'll be getting together with other like-minded parents. With luck, a few of you will die on ventilators or from long term post-COVID complications down the road. Both your children and society at large will benefit with you gone. You're willful spreaders of disease, disinformation, and death, and may your spines be broken on the consequences.</p>

<p>Be fucking happy you arent like us in Sweden. 7500 deaths, incredible amounts of well deserved vitrol, an economy still doing poorly.</p>
<p>Fucking shut up. Act like an adult and stop crying over the smallest fucking thing. You dont know how lucky you are.

        <p>You know what cupcake? If you don't have a mandate or a lockdown, you can still voluntarily wear a mask and stay home. So quit your bitching.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit. In case it wasn't clear, you don't need a mandate to take the precautions you think you do. If the people of Sweden wanted, they could do it anyways. If they're not doing it voluntarily, then obviously they don't feel the way you do.</p>
