    <strong>Mask Craziness</strong>
    <p><p><em>[Dear Moderators: I tried to post my story on other subs, but no one would post it. So, I deleted them. This has not been posted anywhere and I would love to share my story. Would you mind posting this?]</em></p>
<p>Earlier this week, I had a terrible experience at McGuckin Hardware in Boulder, CO. The cashiers refused to check me out unless I put on a mask. They let me in, store employees helped me get the products I needed. But the cash register ladies refused to check me out, even though they are wearing masks and have a piece of plexiglass between them and customers.</p>
<p>I let them know I am medically exempt but they didn’t seem to care. They called the store manager who said I need to ware a mask. A couple of customers stood up for me, but their words fell on deaf ears. I asked to talk to the manager and they said she will be there shortly.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed and no manager. So, I decided to go to the back registers to find the managers and see if she would check me out. </p>
<p>There was a white middle aged manager and a black store manager in her 40s. When I got to the cashiers, the young man was going to check me out when the black store manager came up to me and started freaking out. She said in a yelling like voice:</p>
<p>Black Store Manager: “We will not check you out!”</p>
<p>Me: “But I have already been helped and I am medically exempt.”</p>
<p>Black Manager: “You need to respect my employees feelings! They don’t feel comfortable checking you out! If you were in my house and I asked you not to wear shoes you would do that.”</p>
<p>Me: “Of course.”</p>
<p>Black Manager: “You are in my house. The CDC says its safe to wear masks for 15 minutes at a time. Get out of my house!!”</p>
<p>She then went to put some carts back in the pile 20 feet away. This black manager was literally shaking and getting more and more upset. Me and the white store manage stayed perfectly calm. By this time we were drawing a crowd because the store manager kept yelling. </p>
<p>White Manager: “I can hold on to these items until you get a mask.”</p>
<p>Me: “Nahhh...I can get these products elsewhere. You do understand that this is discrimination and what the Nazis did.”</p>
<p>White Manager: “no, don't say that.”</p>
<p>Black Store Manager: “Get out of my house!”</p>
<p>Me to the Black store manager: "Lady you really don’t need to get so upset. You really don’t.”</p>
<p>White Manager: “You don’t seem to be understanding.”</p>
<p>Me: Laughing...”I do understand. I really do. I just want to finish up the conversation.”</p>
<p>White Manager: “That’s cool.”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Black Store Manager: “Get out of my house!!” At this point she was 40 feet away from me looking terrified.</p>
<p>Me: Looking straight at the black store manager...”I might as well be black and this is the 50s.”</p>
<p>Black Store Manager: "Get out of my house!!”</p>
<p>So I left. I mainly felt sorry for the black store manager during the entire exchange. It didn't feel nice how she treated me, a 20 year long customer, but she didn't know that nor does she care apparently.</p>
<p>I am no longer welcomed into a store that has seen a lot of turn over since Ace Hardware bought them out 2 or so years ago. </p>
<p>I have left as many bad reviews as I could. I also ran across other people/postings who had similar experiences at this hardware store. One lady was literally in a wheel chair with an oxygen tank and the employees harassed her terribly about wearing a mask.</p>
<p>This mask stuff is a new form of discrimination.  People have lost their minds.</p></p>

        <p>🤣 hilarious (i’m numb now) story. i was sick of the house metaphor by the end of it. next time get a masked person who defended you to buy on your behalf with your money.</p>
<p>not surprised you’re being banned elsewhere for sharing a simple story. people think mentioning race makes you racist. i think in this case it added literal and figurative color to the story.</p>
<p>anyone who reads racism from a post like this is projecting.</p>

        <p>My family offered to go back and buy the items at the hardware store. But, I decided that they will not get my money (which would be a reward) after how I was treated. So, I found another place to get what I needed.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought this wasn't getting posted in other subs because of the black and white references. You are probably right.</p>

        <p>Does your state have a mask mandate? If not I would have stood there. Good luck getting a cop to enforce  mask mandate that doesn't exist. After it was all said and done, I would have went, "you know I don't need this after all"...piss that doomer bitch off completely. This is just a Karen drunk on the little power she was with the iq to fill a shot glass.</p>

        <p>Yup, Colorado has a mask mandate. The governor lifted the out door mask mandate a month ago. It is still up to each town to have a mask mandate or not...the governor only has so much power over each town. As a side note these mask mandates are illegal as hell. </p>
<p>He says he will lift all mask mandates in the future. Half the counties in the state ignored the mask mandate (smaller towns). The governor tried to bully them at first, but lost.</p>

        <p>Honestly if you actually have a serious enough medical condition to not be able to wear a mask, why not just use the curbside pick up instead to avoid any potential harmful situations? Of course though, that would deny you the pleasure of getting into heated "conversations" with management. I cant really come up with any medical condition that prohibits you from wearing a mask, but also can still argue and walk around just fine, but it's private, so I'm sure it's real.</p>

        <p>Lol sounds like the manager was defending her employees who clearly did not want to ring you up, as you said. Being "polite" and not getting upset doesn't make you right. Not only that but you singled her out for her race like she's supposed to empathize with you when you seem to be going around claiming medical exemption anyway. I guess if you were back in Jim Crow times you'd be doing your best to pass as white and avoid the victimhood you're still trying to claim? Get a grip and stop downplaying racist history just so you can feel like you're overcoming something. <em>I might as well be black in the 50s.</em> That's so fucking dumb. There are black people living this right now too if ya didnt know. Id rather be here than the fucking 50s, personally.</p>

        <p>Sorry, the following is certainly not what you want to hear. But its my opinion and I hope you can use it to reflect the situation.</p>
<p>One the one hand Im with you, fuck masks, compliance and all that. On the other hand, the lady has a point. Its her house, her rules and you should respect them.</p>
<p>Also, I think you are way out of line when comparing this to Nazis or being black in the 50s. While everything points at it getting as bad or even worse, we are still far from it. Not only is your statement disrespectul to the horrors of history, but its also not something a normie can comprehend. Its essentially hurting our movement as this comparison is rightfully considered crazy (at this point).</p>
<p>Jews or Blacks couldnt just go to another hardware store, order online or just wear a mask. And their "punishment" was much more severe than not being allowed to shop at one hardware store.</p>
<p>None the less, I applaud you for staying maskless! Stay strong, dont be to upset with the average person, the propaganda is strong.</p>

        <p>I have to disagree with you. Let's look at the get out of my house thing...it was not her house but the hardware store. The hardware store is not her house...this lady just got unhinged. It was funny, yet really sad to watch her do this.</p>
<p>As for the historical references, they are accurate. They didn't start out as bad as they finished, but it will get there if not stopped. And it was more then Jews that ended up in the concentration camps. There was nothing disrespectful about my comments, nor does it hurt our movement. If you are not willing to say these things out loud, call them out for what they are shaping up to be, then you are holding back the movement. If you are concerned about these comments sounding crazy, then you are are letting the media control what you say out of fear of being called crazy...you will never win if you don't say these things out loud.</p>

        <p>Im a businessowner myself. If Im not here my manager or whomever is next in line will act on my behalf. I for one want my staff to be feel as if this was their house and act accordingly. Thats why Im somewhat sympathetic with her in that regard.</p>
<p>You missunderstand my intentions. Its not about fear of being called crazy. The question is: What is your intention? Do you want to hurt them? Or do you want them to come "on our side"?</p>
<p>If its the latter, then what good is it to make comparisons that they consider crazy? Do you seriously believe anyone of them will start to reflect after work and be like "Hmmm... that lady was right, I was acting like a Nazi." Or, rather call her "normie" friend and tell her "Today was another one of those crazys in my store?".</p>
<p>I believe it is the latter.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong, clearly we have to speak out. But, and thats just my opinion, making such comparisons wont help. I mean just think about this for a minute, if someone was comparing you to the Nazis, no matter why, what would your reaction be?</p>
<p>In my country, the anti-covid-protests have been linked by MSM to a politicial party that is supposedly racist. So, when I went to one of the rallys, some friends were actually asking me whether I had become a Nazi. How friendly do you believe my reaction was?</p>
<p>And obviously its insane to ask someone who protest against gonvernment control and for freedom if he is a Nazi. To every sane person a Nazi represent the exact opposite, but that is the current understanding they are having. Thats what we gotta work with.</p>

        <p>I hear ya. But, I still disagree with you.  I don't really care if she called up her friends and said it's another crazy Trump supporter.  You will never change their minds. Something drastic is going to have to happen to them for their minds to get changed. Other people heard it and that's the important part...other people aren't going on a power trip nor overcome by unnecessary fear, and are willing to at least listen.</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear your friends asked you if you became a Nazi yourself.  I think it is something we have to put up with and not let it stop us from saying what is going on is very Nazi like. Because it is, and those in power don't want us calling this out so they can continue to get away with it. We have to speak up about it. The comparison has to be made. Or concentration camps will be here before you know it.</p>

<p>About the business being your house, I am reminded of a couple of sayings my grandmothers always told me (one of my grandmas was a business owner for 30 years):</p>
<p>(1) Separate business and personal.</p>
<p>(2) Always leave your problems at home.</p>
<p>So to me, you wanting your employees to feel like their place of work is their home will only make them think in unprofessional ways, thus act in unprofessional ways. They will not clearly make the division between what is personal and what is business. It is not a good state of mind. I know that got started to help keep employees from jumping ship, but it's just not a good policy and this "pandemic" is giving many examples of why it's not a good idea.</p>

<p>Being their home is poorly worded. What I mean is, if Im not there, I want the next line to act as if it was he was actually boss. I want them to handle things on their own and dont feel scared of doing something differently than I do.</p>

        <p>If you truly have a medical reason you can’t wear a mask, they owe you a reasonable accommodation. Letting you shop unmasked is not a reasonable accommodation. Getting your order together for you and bringing it to you outside would have been a reasonable accommodation, as would a number of other solutions. You didn’t want accommodated. You wanted to make a scene.</p>

        <p>You're 100% in the wrong here by the way. Even if what you claim is true and you have a medical condition that makes it so you cannot wear a mask, you don't get a magic waiver. See the actual Boulder County order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reasonable Accommodations. If an individual qualifies for a medical exception, the business shall offer reasonable accommodations (such as curbside delivery), but the business is not required to allow the person to enter the Public Indoor Space without a Face Covering.</li>
