    <strong>Lies. Lies. Lies. But my employer cares about me!</strong>
    <p><p>Hi  all. I've been away for quite some time - I got in a pretty dark place  and needed a break from it all. I've been attending protests etc to try  and keep engaged and keep my spirits up, and have a circle of  like-minded peeps that I hang out with, but it's been rough.</p>
<p>I've been watching the shit show that is the "vaccine", and everything I fear just keeps coming true - again and again.</p>
<p>I  was moved to write again after receiving a draft Power Point slide deck  through a fellow manager showing how the organization I work for  intends to approach its "voluntary" rollout of "vaccines".</p>
<p>I  would love to screen shot the presentation and put it up in its  original form, but I would doxx myself by doing so. I'll give a summary,  with comments. Very curious to see what other members here have  received from their employers - and how much <em>they</em> have lied to you...</p>
<p>The  first couple of slides are boilerplate senior leader messaging -  begging everyone to get "vaccinated", throwing out veiled threats that  future employment may be affected, claiming to have "experienced  Covid-19", and most chillingly (a direct quote)...</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Having  personally experienced COVID-19, I can tell you the symptoms are  difficult, but I found the feeling of being a biohazard and threat to  those around me even worse.</strong></p>
<p><em>A nauseating combination of collective shaming, virtue-signalling and guilt-tripping if I ever saw one...</em></p>
<p>Below is a Cole's notes talking point summary of the remaining slides, with lies noted in bold, comments in italics:</p>
<p>&rt;- <strong>All vaccines approved by Health Canada are effective.</strong></p>
<p><em>Ummm. No. They are approved as emergency measures only. That's why you can't be forced to take it...</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>- The vaccines are safe. Over 350 000 000 people have received one</strong></p>
<p><em>Note they didn't deign to state where this figure comes from. Irrelevant noise to prop up the narrative...</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>- Serious side effects are rare: between 2-3 for every million doses.</strong></p>
<p><em>If  they claim 350 000 000 people have been jabbed, some napkin math here  shows they are trying to tell us only 700 or 900-ish people have had  serious side effects.</em> <strong><em>Thousands of people have fucking died, hundreds of thousands with side effects</em></strong>*, easily verified in minutes online. How stupid do these people think we are???*</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>- The vaccine will not be mandatory in the</strong> <strong><em>(redacted)</em></strong> <strong>but it could be a requirement for some deployments and positions.</strong></p>
<p><em>Now we get down to it - the veiled threat of being a second-class citizen/employee if you refuse...</em></p>
<p>&rt;- <strong>Ten percent of people will have long lasting symptoms = temporary or permanent medical employment limitations</strong></p>
<p><em>Ten  percent of who? Positive tests? Hospitalizations? Those who were  triggered because their co-worker doesn't wear five masks and jerk off  in front of Fauchi's portrait? This sentence is meaningless  fear-mongering...</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>This  type of vaccine makes your immune system familiar with the spike  protein, so it can kill off the coronavirus in the event of infection  and prevent disease</strong></p>
<p><em>Wait  a minute! The pharma companies themselves have told us you can still  get and transmit CCPvirus after the jab. Isn't this why our masters say  we still have to have masks, lockdowns, and "social distancing"? My head  hurts.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Can’t  just let people get infected and develop natural immunity: too many  people will die or develop long-term health problems, Natural immunity  is also not as reliable: reinfection.</strong></p>
<p><em>What's  the actual death rate again? .003% or so? If natural immunity is so  unreliable, why are people who get diseases immune for life, while those  who get vaccinated require boosters? Jenner, Pasteur, and Koch must be  rolling in their graves...</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>No approval steps or testing were skipped in the development of the vaccines.</strong></p>
<p><em>Like the youngsters say... "I can't even!" Animal testing? Testing on children, effects on pregnancy? Hello???</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Most people experience mild side effects. Serious side effects, such as allergies, are rare.</strong></p>
<p><em>The  list of side effects presented in the slide deck, strangely enough,  leaves out well-documented doozies like blindness, paralysis, blood  clots, and of course... DEATH!</em></p>
<p>There is more, but the point is the same :</p>
<p>"Valued  employees, we care about you and your health - so much so that we will  lie to you, shame you, and gaslight you so you will line up and take  this unproven, un-needed pseudo-vaccine, and play your part as good  little citizens in creating our new bio-security state. Thank you."</p></p>

        <p>My work pushes it while always adding "not mandatory and a personal decision". We get regular covid update emails. Just got one about the JJ vaccines being halted. There was a Q&amp;A one from a nurse stating how safe and effective they are. I didn't read it. The newest bs that I still can't get over is how they claim unvaccinated employees must quarantine if they leave the state, specifically targeting vacations. No one sane is following it. We just keep our social media private and between real friends. I'm still waiting for the announcement on why they ordered a covid test machine and tests. I'm sure it's to punish the unvaccinated. I haven't posted any of these for the same reason.</p>

        <p>I'm going to put up a post soon about the actual "vaccine plan" for us that I got ahold of.</p>
<p>I'm so tempted to send it all in to The Rebel to see if they would go public with it. Except I am worried that I, and the person who gave me the info, will get hunted down by our employer.</p>
<p>A lot of older guys will stand their ground and say no to the jab, but I have no doubt that a lot of our younger, junior staff will get bullied into compliance.</p>

        <p>I had covid.  It was just a REAL bad cold/flu for 4 days.  I beat it using the traditional medicines of my people:  Campbell’s chicken noodle soup, Day-Quil and Sprite.</p>

        <p>Yep. Lots of employers, schools, etc., in the US are pulling out all the stops from lies, damned lies, and "statistics," to get their employees to vaccinate without actually requiring it. If they require it, they'll likely be on the hook for damages.</p>
<p>You had a great breakdown. That message is just full to the brim with misleading crap and lies. Geez.</p>
<p>Anytime anything like this has come up, I simply respond with "Okay, thank you for your concern. I do not discuss my private/personal medical information."</p>

        <p>I am always shocked by how many people think vaccines are superior to natural immunity.  I mean, you do realize it's still using your body's immune system, just training it on a portion of the virus?</p>
<p>We don't have that chip filtering disease out of our blood, yet.</p>

        <p>We have to wonder how much our current diet and climate has disrupted our immunity. Thirty years ago it was almost shameful to be on medications for high blood pressure, etc. Today, those who are not on some kind of medication for depression, anxiety, or some kind of cholesterol or blood pressure issue are viewed as the outliers.</p>
