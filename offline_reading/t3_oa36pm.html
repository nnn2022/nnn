    <strong>Personality changes among friends (also acquaintance, family) who had the Covid vaccine??????</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not sure if it is just me seeing this, but many people I know (including family members) who had the vaccine have changed even though it has been months already after their last jab. I see it especially in people who previously were energetic, ambitious, happy, extroverted  becoming worn out, hopeless, not enjoying anything, secretive (pretending they are fine), and emotionally distanced after receiving it which is very 'not them'. I have also noticed previously nice and polite people becoming more aggressive after the vaccine which is very out of character?</p>
<p>I previously thought it may be a 'temporary' side effect from the vaccine but the effects seem to last much longer.</p>
<p>Is this 'personality change' due to them realizing the vaccine won't give them freedom (i.e. won't protect against the new variants) or is it a direct side effect of the vaccine or both???</p>
<p>Any ideas???? I feel like many people have turned into zombies but I don't know if it is just me noticing this?     :(</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: thanks for all your replies!!</p>

<p>We just don’t know the long term effects yet, nor do they, but with each passing day they probably feel they’re growing closer to confirmation of long term unwanted symptoms.</p>

        <p>I've noticed how a lot of people are becoming less and less confident in the vax.</p>
<p>Now, they're saying that the vax only prevents you from becoming hospitalized, and doesn't prevent you from becoming infected.</p>

        <p>I agree. Later they will be saying the vaccine works for only few months and the vaccine certificates expire if another dose is not taken within x number of weeks. I  also wonder why the new variant is called Delta- the other ones weren't named Alpha, Beta, Gamma?</p>

        <p>Agree, the realization that all their hopes rested on a lie. Accepting the deceit is hard, especially when seeing the non-takers are doing just fine. That said, nobody did ever promise them they would go back to normal, after taking it. They were also told you can still get and transmit the virus, something they seem to be in denial of too.</p>

<p>This is what's funniest to me. It's not like that was ever hidden. Anybody who bothered to do a little bit of reading on how mRNA vaccines work would have known this from the get go. I used to get so frustrated trying to discuss it with people whose only knowledge on the subject was seeing the man on the news say they needed to get the shot.</p>

        <p>And, they knew they could get it but were supposed to be protected from severe symptoms that could lead to death, yet now in the UK the 'delta' variant has killed 117, over 50% of whom were vaccinated.  Added to the fact that side effects articles are being released. If any or all of this made the mainstream and I were vaccinated I'd feel betrayed, lied to, silly, and a little worried at this point.</p>

        <p>Yep. Also, imagine getting the AZ one.</p>
<p>Where I live that was the only one available at one point, and they were saying "the best vaccine is the first one available" ... A week after the other ones became available they pulled it.</p>
<p>I'm a bit conflicted. So many people I love and care about have fallen for it, but the writing has been on the wall. 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>Of those I know who had it, some don't even know which one. Now the UK is sending unused AZ to third world countries. We're told AZ works better with 3 jabs. PF or MOD are the best 2nd jab following a first jab of AZ.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, phase out AZ following the leaking (real) bad press, and get everyone 2nd jabbed or newly jabbed to an PF or MOD.</p>
<p>Day by day less and less attention is required to become aware of what we've been saying since day one, the narrative is slowly falling apart for even the most ignorant people.</p>

        <p>It's possible. </p>
<p>These gene therapies masquerading as vaccines are evil and contain CRISPR tech which is known to be able to perform gene editing or in their own words "overriding our body's operating system" even if they claim it doesn't. </p>
<p>There are many posts of depression and uncontrollable crying in r/CovidVaccinated,  a sub which is supposed to be in favor of these things but is increasingly looking like a support group for the duped. </p>
<p>I've noticed a couple of friends who took it became snarkier as well.</p>
<p>Whether this is the vax itself or a cumulative effect of all the lockdowns, life changes and stresses over the last 1.5 years, who knows,  but it's possible.</p>
