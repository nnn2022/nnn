    <strong>COPD and masks</strong>
    <p><p>So I've been collecting as much information as possible, about victims of the vaccine, mask wearing, hypocrisy in the media about the covid narrative, etc. Just over the last few days, but this one caught my eye in particular. And that is the relation between masks and a condition known as  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<p>Apparently it is a common cause of death among textile workers, who work around cotton and silk on a daily basis. And the scary part of the illness is there is no cure.</p>
<p><a href="https://lunginstitute.com/blog/no-copd-cure-breaking-science/">https://lunginstitute.com/blog/no-copd-cure-breaking-science/</a></p>
<p>the lung health institute states that  <strong>is set to become the third leading cause of death by 2020.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pdmj.org/papers/masks_false_safety_and_real_dangers_part1/"><strong>https://pdmj.org/papers/masks_false_safety_and_real_dangers_part1/</strong></a></p>
<p>in this source, there's some interesting stuff.</p>
<p>"Cotton and silk may contribute to COPD in textile workers"</p>
<p>"Neither medication nor radiation can undo the damage of the fibrous matrix laid down in the lungs' tissue. Similarly, surgery is not available to eliminate the insidious, suffocating mesh that painstakingly takes the life of the unfortunate patient. Neither is any known cure available in the realm of natural or alternative medicine."</p>
<p>This has me worried, since everyone is wearing masks all day, some people are re using their masks, some people masks are homemade and possibly made of unknowingly dangerous materials, and the wear and tear is possibly causing people to breath in more fibers.</p>
<p>"Therefore, there is even more need that the fibers, debris and other particulate attached to cloth masks would stay entirely intact; every fiber, and every part of every fiber, and throughout every breath, at all times, even down to the size of nanometers."</p>
<p>There is no fucking way that all of the masks that we are forced to wear meet those safety requirements.  Oh, and if respiratory problems weren't enough</p>

<p>“We’re seeing inflammation in people’s gums that have been healthy forever, and cavities in people who have never had them before,” Ramondi said. “About 50% of our patients are being impacted by this, [so] we decided to name it ‘mask mouth’ — after ‘meth mouth.’”</p>
<p>"Meth mouth" is a term used to describe poor oral hygiene typically associated with chronic meth users.</p>
<p>If anyone has any more shit to share about the masks, I'd love to see it. I have a few other things, but I just wanted to point out what was most striking to me at the time.</p></p>

        <p>I have inflammation in my gums as of last week. My mask is made of mesh though…..but it’s still fabric. I hadn’t considered that the mask is the problem. (And as of yesterday I no longer wear it anywhere). My mom has COPD because of smoking. And I just want to say that there are a lot of holier than though COPD patients who love announce that if they can wear a mask so can everyone else. Well my mom can’t wear a mask! Her oxygen level is usually in the low 90s WITH an oxygen tank. When she wears a mask it dips down to high 70s and she gets very short of breath and feels like she’s going to pass out!</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry your mom is going through that. One of my close family members died of COPD just before COVID, and as bad as it got the last few years, there’s <em>no freaking way</em> she could’ve worn a mask. She could hardly breathe without a mask, and with oxygen support. A mask would’ve killed her. As much as I miss her, I’m glad she isn’t here for this anti-science mask-cult bull crap.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I’m so sorry about your family member. COPD is awful. And one sliver lining here is that they didn’t have to live through COVID AND COPD at the same time. I harbor a lot of resentment toward the doomers who demanded we all stay home &amp; save lives, because they used people like my mom &amp; your family member to virtue signal and act morally superior! They said we needed to limit our trips to the store because of all the immunocompromised &amp; high risk people who have to do their own shopping. Meanwhile us skeptics and anti-lockdowners said well those are the people we need to protect and should probably stay home. Yet WE got called selfish granny killers UNTIL…..UNTIL masks happened! And soon as soon as people said they couldn’t wear a mask (because of COPD and asthma etc) the doomers had no use for them anymore and they started saying “well then you should stay the fuck home if you can’t wear a mask. You really shouldn’t be leaving the house during a pandemic anyway”. And yet they still continued to call the rest of us selfish granny killers because we didn’t want to stay home while the economy tanked, the country went to shit and our kids suffered…..they are truly horrible people.</p>

        <p>Masks can cause a COPD exacerbation in patients with moderate to end stage COPD due to prolonged usage. Once a patient with COPD suffers from their first exacerbation they will likely suffer them again more frequently. It’s miserable and most often leads to hospitalization. Some of the medications have side effects that cause anxiety issues and panic attacks which will make a bad situation worse. Prednisone can cause this with older patients. Allergy season combined with a mask is a recipe for disaster for anyone with moderate to end stage COPD. Anyone who has been the primary caregiver or family member with someone who suffers with this knows exactly what I’m talking about. COPD is heartbreaking because little by little the patient becomes less independent and becomes dependent on an oxygen tank. My advice to healthy individuals to offset mask damage is don’t smoke and try to exercise. There are breathing exercises to make your lungs stronger that they have COPD patients do as part of a daily at home regimen.</p>

        <p>Let's not forget that gum disease can lead to heart disease.  </p>
<p>Keep up the investigation and gathering of information, I truly believe that masks are one of the main drivers of hospitalizations during this pandemic. That, and the blatant disregard for any real type of out patient care.  </p>
<p>How does no one connect the dots?  </p>
<p>Person gets diagnosed with covid and then isolates, and wears a mask 24/7. They end up in the hospital, where... wait for it... you continue to wear a mask, until your oxygen levels drop to the point where you are put on oxygen.</p>
