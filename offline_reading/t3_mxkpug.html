    <strong>The continued climate of fear is taking away the best years of many people’s lives</strong>
    <p><p>Our state lifted its mask mandate back on April 9.  Since then, I do not believe I have worn a mask at all.  Still, when visiting some of the old stores I used to visit frequently, most are masked up, and essentially seem oblivious to the world around them.  I do question why they would venture out of their homes at all, if they are under such fear of the virus. </p>
<p>I also have a child in college, living in a city which continues to enforce mask rules.  She is 21, and she has now lived through over a year of continual suppression of being able to enjoy the life of a college student.  Things like going to a bar, being in a crowd at a ball game, house parties, and all of that, are all strained, though she has less “fear” than many i see around me.</p>
<p>My other child is in 6th grade, and the enforcement of masks continues there too.  All of her interactions with class mates now is through the filter of a paper mask.  Unfortunately, this group now accepts that it is just this way.  </p>
<p>As for me, I continue to spend most of my time at home.  I was a very social person prior, and I long for those interactions.  Now, it’s all done through a phone or a computer screen.  I hate it.  This has all dragged on long enough, and I don’t have confidence that the vaccine effort is going to really change any of this.  People’s minds have been altered to believe that all sickness, all germs, all interactions, present life threatening risk to them.  They all live in fear.  For so many, life will not return to normal ever.  Many don’t even want it to.  They see this all, as an “improvement”.  My income, and my wife’s, has not been effected, and I’m grateful for that, as so many people’s livelihoods have been altered.  Perhaps, forever.</p></p>

        <p>My dad died last summer. He spent the best three months of his last year (when he was off chemo, but before he went into his final decline) too scared to come and see his two grandchildren. My heart was breaking then because I knew that with myself and my wife working from home, the risk was very close to zero, but he was a grown up and could make his own decisions.</p>
<p>He came twice after that, but was too worn out to spend any time with them and he snapped at my son who is just little and loud and isn't good company for someone with constant headaches. We had to ask him not to come back after that. I was able to spend a week with him before he died, but of course that was very miserable.</p>
<p>I hate the campaign of fear that put him in that state of mind where he wouldn't come to visit. I hate the blanket restrictions, misleading info, and lack of basic respect for citizens that kept people from making their own choices and evaluating their own actions in light of the facts as they were then known.</p>
<p>It's coming up on a year this summer and we still haven't been able to have a funeral/celebration of life. He was well-liked, but by the time it can happen legally, people will have moved on and it's probably just going to be me and my mom and a few close friends rather than the community gathering it should have been.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry to hear of your sad circumstances.  I really am, friend.  My dad left this world 18 years ago, and the grief my mom, my sister, and I felt, was only lifted through the interactions with friends and other family.  I still shed a tear for him when I hear a song that reminds me of him, when I think of how much he enjoyed bass fishing, sitting out on a calm lake, in a bass boat.  When I think of how he drank a cup of coffee, how he drove a pick up truck.  Nothing special about any of that, but it’s the memories you have left.</p>
<p>If I knew you or your father, at all, I would come to any small memorial service you may have.  I’d come because I want you to know, you aren’t alone.  You are a person, as is your mother, your extended family, and you are loved.</p>

        <p>I def feel I've been robbed of a lot since this began. Missed out on a lot of opportunities and experiences. All i can mumble is "what a world, what a time to be alive..."</p>

        <p>you are fortunate that you are somewhere that has lifted the mask mandate - if I were you I would get out there and live!  see people!  do what you want to do!  it sucks to see all the sheep around, but if you are free to do as you please - do it!</p>
