    <strong>My fear is not paranoia.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm glad that I am old enough to make decisions for myself- 10 years ago I'd have been under Legal Guardians's roof and forced to get stuck with that MRNA thing. When I was a minor, I was made to have that Gardasil shit, I think that is what it was called. I was not told about mother's decision and a nurse walked into the office with my shot. I had a full blown panic attack in front of a nurse, cried and ran out of the clinic. I was verbally assaulted by my mother, I was "embarrassing her." I had to return for the next two doses on my own. I have suspicions that my reproductive issues and chrinoc pain can be directly linked to that injection. That was the first time I felt medicine was not for the good of all people and that doctors do not have the best interest at heart. I remember the ads on TV. She bought into it.  Another trial I was entered into was for an acne medication. It was such an intense medication and very secret - at 14 I signed a paper saying that I understood that if I were to get pregnant I'd get an abortion. The known side effects for pregnancy would deform the baby severely and the government wouldn't be responsible. A whole book was given to me about what was going to happen. (Again I was a minor and had no control of my body until I was 19) I had more information for an experimental pimple pill than whatever the hell this Injection is. I've been treated wrongly and inhumanely by those who are meant to help - every time I've gone to the clinic. EVERY TIME!!! My fear is not paranoia.</p></p>

        <p>Having legitimate concerns over the safety/efficacy of <em>any</em> product what-so-ever is an undeniable right. If that carnival ride looks sketchy, then walk the fuck away.</p>

        <p>That's beyond awful. The medical profession is far closer to nurse Ratchet than Florence Nightingale at this point. Every word out of their mouth is to be treated with extreme skepticism. And I wish your mom had done a better job of protecting you. That was the least that you deserved.</p>
