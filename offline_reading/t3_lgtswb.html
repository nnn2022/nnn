        <p>Please.</p>
<p>Get some freaking perspective, people.</p>
<p>&rt;"We thought we would never see a pandemic that would square with HIV," said Thandi Nhlengethwa, executive director of the AIDS Information and Support Centre.</p>
<p>&rt;"Then COVID was on our doorstep."</p>
<p>&rt;Nhlengethwa says patients can live with HIV for many years but COVID seems to be killing her compatriots quickly. </p>

        <p>Why is C19 worse than AIDS and TB?  </p>
<p>&rt; In the past few months, COVID has been linked to the deaths of two Eswatini cabinet ministers, the country's Anglican bishop and its 52-year-old prime minister. </p>
<p>C19 has been linked to the deaths (read: 2 dead people had a false positive PCR test AFTER they had died) of two cabinet ministers and that's worse than the hundreds of thousands of people who have died from AIDS and TB. Sure, Jan.</p>

        <p>According to WHO **(verify with other sources)** in 2019 1.4 million people died from TB and there were an estimated 10 million new cases (remember in WHO speak cases means actual sick people, not asymptomatic people)</p>
<p>Many strains of TB are drug resistant, and the ones that aren't require an incredibly strict medication protocol to eliminate...  otherwise they become drug resistant...  </p>
<p>Unlike covid, AIDS and TB don't go away...</p>

        <p>Lockdowns have caused an enormous increase in AIDS and TB deaths, on top of the <em>three million</em> that occurred in 2019 without the Western media giving a shit. AIDS has a 100% death rate if left untreated, across all age groups, next to SARS-CoV-2's 0.002 - 8.4%.</p>

        <p>TBH, won't even click on the article, had my overdose of brainwashing for the day and i'd like to keep my sanity, but like WTF? They are legit claiming that it's worse then HIV which has 0% survivability without meds ,while the wuu has like 99,5% + survivability rate ,usually wo any meds. </p>
<p>I wonder if zoombies are so brainwashed that they'd believe that the scientists did an new research and concluded that the covid is a certain death sentence from now on and the only reason why ppl before survived it is bcs they didn't do that research then yet. IK this is a total gibberish but so is 95% of doomers and news brainwashing and ppl are following through...</p>

        <p>The article is about the kids and the school.  The kids rely on it as their main and sometimes only meal of the day.  Parentless homes due to aids and they are now isolated with no contact or internet and they dont even know if the kids are eating or OK.</p>
