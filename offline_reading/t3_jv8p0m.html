    <strong>Does anyone else wish the governors would just get it over with and lock the states down already?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in New Jersey, a state that enacted some of the most brutal, non-scientific lockdowns from March until about the end of June.  Positive test rates are going up here big time, and it is pretty much inevitable at this point that Murphy is going to shut the state down again.  </p>
<p>However, he won’t just rip the Band-Aid and do it.  He’s taking tiny steps to try and limit indoor gatherings, essentially saying, “I’m about to lock it down, but I’m giving you guys one last chance to behave yourselves.”  My family will not be complying for Thanksgiving, and I will not comply with a stay-at-home order either.  But clearly, a lockdown is coming, and since I know it’s going to happen, I’d rather him announce it today or tomorrow and just get the misery over with, instead of gradually teasing us with the hope that he might not go full lockdown.  Same thing with Whitmer in Michigan.  She did about 75% of a full lockdown, and I gather many people there would rather her just get the torture over with instead of keeping people in suspense.</p>
<p>Believe me, I don’t want another miserable lockdown like we had in the spring, but this is Murphy we’re talking about, in one of the most liberal states in the country.  He’s actually pissing me off more now by gradually increasing the restrictions and moving towards a full lockdown, than if he just went all out and shut everything today.  Because just maybe, he would let us out by the holidays instead of prolonging the misery.  Any other blue state dwellers feel the same way?</p></p>

        <p>They are playing the game. These governors can't just come out "full lockdown" again. Just going to ease us all back into it. Its stupid and just plays with peoples heads. Come December all the states will 100% be March level lockdowns.</p>

        <p>All the blue states will.  Not Florida, Texas, Mississippi or South Dakota.  The lockdowns piss me off to no end.  And the governors are literally just shifting the blame to their citizens because they know these measures are going to do very little, if anything, to slow the spread.  It’s like a parent saying to their small child, “I tried to just set limits instead of fully punishing you, but you pushed me, so now I have no choice.”  Sickening</p>

        <p>The blue state governors don’t care at all, unfortunately.  It’s all about how awful their citizens are for daring to leave their homes, go to work and socialize with others and kill Grandma.</p>

        <p>I'm in NJ and I agree, just do it already. On a larger note, I wish they'd just get to the point on whatever all this is truly about. Vaccines, microchip, wiping out the population, more control... whatever it is, just do it, most people would gladly go along with anything at this point.  I'm sick of back and forth lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity is really the most effective, while taking extra steps to protect the vulnerable.  (I know someone from another sub is going to come over now and start ripping me apart, but I don’t care).  Their rationale for this is that asymptomatic people could unknowingly transmit it to their coworker, who then gives it to their cousin, who is also asymptomatic and passes it on to their grandma, who then dies.  We should be taking precautions when we’re around the elderly and infirm, in places they can’t avoid (not places they could avoid, but choose to go to anyway knowing the risk).  And that’s simple.  It’s not about locking down the entire state and destroying more lives than the virus ever could.  It’s absolutely ridiculous.  I’d be perfectly fine with a national mask mandate or mandatory testing or vaccine, if it means this misery can end.</p>
<p>I actually thought Murphy was going to announce the full lockdown this afternoon, being influenced by Whitmer.  But now I think he’ll wait until right before Thanksgiving, next week.  My dad and I are making a dinner reservation on Thanksgiving Day, knowing full well we’ll probably be cancelling it anyway.</p>

        <p>I’m in RI &amp; they are doing the EXACT same thing. “Going back some steps” to “see if we start following orders” but saying if a change doesn’t happen in a couple weeks we will be shut down. I can’t tell why they want to wait the few weeks to shut people, I feel like there’s a reason their fucking with everyone.</p>

        <p>Yeah, WE know.  They have the magical delusion that it makes the virus go away.  No, it doesn’t.  We literally hit a pause button, and then because viruses are contagious by nature, it’ll spread again once we open.  It’s not about the virus anymore, and never really was except for the first “two weeks.”  What it’s about now, is power and moving towards socialism.</p>
