    <strong>genuine questions for this subreddit, dont reply if your not going to have a conversation.</strong>
    <p><p>I've been looking around at many different places recently (mainly here) and have seen that this subreddit obviously don't like the COVID restrictions or maybe deny COVID completely or you distrust the media which is fair and I don't want to sound like I'm trying to cause a confrontation but I have some genuine questions.<br>
No one yet has been able to provide me with sources or documents or anything other than their own word to discredit the COVID pandemic and how the government is dealing with it, I would like to see some actual numbers some actual documentation, some proof you might say, by a qualified professional that the information the media is giving the public is wrong.</p>
<p>I am open to having my mind changed or swayed and I'm open to discussion not  arguing but civil normal discussion about the problem at hand.</p>
<p>thank you for your time.</p></p>

        <p>The problem is how governments and corporations are responding to the virus. For example, there isn’t any data showing that masks significantly reduce transmission of COVID-19, yet, in many places, you are still required to wear one, even <em>after</em> the CDC backed down. Likewise, schools across the country were shut down despite the fact that school-age children essentially cannot be hurt by the virus. See the problem? The name of this sub is “NoNewNormal,” not “COVID doesn’t exist.”</p>

        <p>Okay so, masks have been proven to reduce amount of bacteria that exit your mouth that's what they are used for, they allow the flow of oxygen but don't allow much bacteria such as COVID-19 to escape through them, you can see this in many videos on the internet or even test it yourself by sneezing through a mask and without one onto something that can detect bacteria.
The children not going to school was not so children would be safer it was that children would not be bringing the disease back to families back home, and the numbers supported this, cases went down when schools shut and cases rose when schools opened but deaths in the younger years up to 16 didn't really change because of the fact that children won't be harmed as you said. I think on both sides there is a miss interpretation of information that needs to be cleared up.</p>

        <p>But masks have not been proven to reduce any pathogens coming from your mouth or nose. They may reduce larger particles such as sneeze or cough droplets. IF (and that’s a big IF) asymptotic spread is real, then a mask will not stop virus particles carried on a normal breath. If the goal is to stop droplet spread, covering your nose and mouths when you sneeze or cough is just as effective. Even with a mask, there will always be aerosolized particles that will escape.</p>

        <p>But that is wrong, medical masks are made so that tiny small particles of air like oxygen and air may pass through them but larger pathogens (relative to the size of oxygen atoms for example) cannot pass through them, or at least some of them can't, therefore most pathogens carried by a normal breathe are caught on masks and that's just facts</p>

        <p>Yes I do believe that because it's like science, I don't know what is hard to understand but oxygen particles are vastly smaller than pathogens and therefore you can filter out the pathogens from the air with a very fine filter like ones in medical masks</p>

        <p>No one here can open the door for you into some alternate reality where everything has been figured out and published into a perfect story for you to digest. And even if they could, you can’t trust any answer you’re hoping to see here. Including mine. This whole thing is a mess. It’s impossible for anyone to know the real story about everything right now. But if you think there’s even the slightest chance that even one of these government responses is not in the best interest of people, anywhere in the world, that should make you nervous. I see many things here every day that make me distrust the government, medical professionals, and the media. All you can do is take in the information that you can and form your own opinion. I know there’s memes and anecdotes, but many posts here are of regular mainstream media. Just with us all having a very different response to the reported information than the mainstream author does.</p>

        <p>I think the government has lost all credibility when they claim to care about public health. Recent decades has shown an epidemic of chronic disease, with 60% of adults having a chronic condition and almost half having 2 or more at a time. The leading causes of death like CVD, cancer, and diabetes are also comorbid in the majority of COVID-related hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Lifestyle choices contribute majorly to the onset of these conditions, and adopting the lifestyles that help to safeguard you from developing these conditions is made difficult and costly by the people who profit off of chronic sickness. The FDA's conflict of interest with pharmaceutical corporations results in the downplaying of the many (non-patentable) factors that go into immunity and demonizes naturopathic strategies and cheap dietary supplements to promote public health. </p>
<p>Our commercial food features toxic additives that destroy nerve and endocrine function because the FDA half-asses their vetting of these additives and has created an immunocompromised population that is set to be ravaged by communicable diseases like COVID. This virus is predominantly killing people who are already in poor health, and it is insane that we are normalizing and applauding free booze and fried foods as incentives for getting this vaccine that is supposed to keep us "healthy".</p>
<p>We only opt for pandemic relief solutions that limit the freedom of choice of citizens, and we choose not to harp on prophylactic health measures or holding these government agencies accountable for their role in this. It is not the unvaccinated 10 year old that is prolonging this pandemic, it is the chronic disregard for public health expressed by the people who are making inoculation with an under-tested medication a condition for travel, education, and leisure. </p>
<p>These dystopian restrictions are a bad-faith attempt by government to create the illusion that this is all for our health when all it does is remove autonomy, destroy lives, and construct a class-based system for functioning in society, where the unvaccinated are treated as diseased rats that need to be partitioned from the rest of us. The media stokes fear and polarizes the public into hating their neighbor instead of projecting their anger towards the institutions that profit off of our suffering. </p>
<p>When valid concerns are met with gaslighting and slander, it's clear that the "science" has been compromised, and financial and power interests are driving the research that guides the policies in which we conduct our life.</p>

        <p>Why would you come to this sub and expect anyone to try to change your mind?  No one here needs to "provide you" with anything.  There are plenty of other subs that cater to the beliefs you have, so why come here?  </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you truly want to look at some alternative points of view, read the sub and keep an open mind.  If you have any knowledge of how science, media, or politics work, you will likely find some things that make you question what you currenltly believe.  It's ok to look at both sides critically instead of blindly following the media narrative or Big Daddy Government telling you what's best for you.  You can do it!  Just start reading.  Do your own homework.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'm not going to have a conversation with you because I really don't care about trying to change your mind, so no need to reply.   Most people who come here with posts like yours are simply trolls, and arent really open to having their "mind changed or swayed".  (Note -  I  answered my first question for you.  It was rhetorical in case you didn't realize.)</p>

        <p>I tell both sides to stop cherry picking data and stories that validate the narrative they want. </p>
<p>If you want to find answers you need to do the nitty gritty research because evidence IS out there...albeit difficult to come by. Discerning the truth right now is NOT easy. There is a lot of propaganda being pushed down our throats right now and to believe that Western media is not susceptible to that is incredibly naive. </p>
<p>There are qualified doctors and scientists sounding alarms right now but either you or the media is choosing to ignore.</p>
