        <p>You cannot have both of these. Choose 1.</p>
<p>A. A deadly bioweapon, designed to kill and released onto the world population.</p>
<p>B. An invisible pandemic so benign, that nobody knows anybody who really died of covid. No deaths in the street, empty hospitals, dancing nurses and testing is needed to even see if you are sick.</p>
<p>The bioweapon angle just does not add up.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s a bio weapon. I think it’s incompetence and then our governments, trying to keep China happy, running cover for them. </p>
<p>That lab has had several violations since 2018 for things like breaking safety protocols.</p>

        <p>Again, just a scripted scapegoat blame-game story. The covid hoax is filled with them. There is no virus, there is no pandemic, it's all in our heads. It's cleverly done, I'll grant you that, but this was prepared for decades. I'd assume a pretty smooth operation by now.</p>

<p>I think you’re giving too much credit to incompetent Government Bureaucrats. People are just easily manipulated because they’re lazy, stressed, and overwhelmed with day to day life.</p>
