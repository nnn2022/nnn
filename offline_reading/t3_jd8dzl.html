    <strong>Is confrontation new for you?</strong>
    <p><p>I have always been a conservative "good" person. I help my neighbors, love my family and never loose my temper but that of course has been shattered in the last few months. I'm finding there's just no way to be cordial with an arrogant leftist employee in a giant mask that seems to be only interested in my unconditional compliance with whatever ridiculous policy. The other night I stormed out of a pizza place, throwing open the door potentially having injured someone, where an employee pretty much yelled at and scolded me for not wearing a mask before I even cleared the welcome mat. If I had hit a kid with that door I would have welcomed the ass kicking I'd get from his or her dad. I feel like it's turning me into something I never wanted to be and don't recognize. Anyone else feeling this way or have any thoughts to share?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I am really on edge lately too. I had dreams for my family, wife and kids and now it seems like I want to run to the mountains and never look back. When I go out in public and see people with masks or read about people's opinions on why everyone should wear a mask it makes me rather sad. Sad knowing that people are not told the truth behind the science of masks. I frusterates me that some people can be so scared of dying to the point where they will not even live there life. And to me that is a real tragedy.</p>

        <p>If it helps at all: they hate when you remain calm and just calmly leave, like “oh well! I wanted to spend money but here but that okay”. That makes them the most angry. </p>
<p>But yes: I’ve been dealing with more anger than I ever have in my whole life. It’s not just the masks. It’s the needless long lines, using COVID as an excuse to lay-off customer service reps so you can’t even call customer service at your bank (or the IRS, or your credit card company, or retailers). It feels like everything has been taken from me and my fellow humans are drooling zombies. I’ve seriously considered medication because I’m worried about blood pressure spikes, which is bad for one’s heart at any age. It’s frustrating.</p>

        <p>Yes. EVERY company is holding onto as much money as they can and they are encouraged to do so by the government. The fact that you can’t call any company to complain or get refunds is crazy. Another thing you never hear anyone talk about. Call centres have been completely abolished.</p>
<p>You’d think govt would be mad at businesses for sacking customer service staff and making people spread the virus in queues and crowded shops. Just another thing to add to the list of things that prove none of this is about safety and all about changing society.</p>

        <p>Before the lockdowns, I almost never got angry. I'd never shouted at anyone in my life, and never would have dreamed of doing so. I'm as passive as anyone can be. Since the lockdowns, I feel so much unadulterated rage. A man shouted "You should wear a mask" at me on the street, and I shouted back, "I hope it makes you feel powerful, harassing women on the street" and then rattled off the CDC statistics I'd had memorized in case I was ever confronted by a busybody freak like that. I'm so angry, every single day. It's not just you. I've been changed forever, I think for the worse.</p>

        <p>Personally I'm more scared of strangers yelling things at me, so I prefer the "always be crazier" method. </p>
<p>I wouldn't and don't yell because that just gets you in a viral Karen video, my plan is to just start hysterically crying as I always have a round of crying in my mental chamber. No words, just weeping. They won't videotape you because they'd be the bad guys to any viewers. At most they'll freak out and leave you alone. I have real anxiety so the start of an anxiety attack usually gets mixed in there too.</p>

        <p>I'm absolutely in the same space as you.</p>
<p>I have zero patience for officious little busybodies whining because I'm not wearing a mask. I've tried to be polite when refusing, but it's getting to the point where I just curtly reply "no", or "medical exemption" and keep walking; I don't even acknowledge their presence.</p>
<p>It's painful when you realize that you are starting to see these people as mere shadows of actual human beings, no more deserving of my attention than white noise in the background.</p>
<p>But I also have decided it's completely justified - since they have zero consideration for my needs, my choices, and my issues, <em>why should I have any for theirs?</em></p>

<p>Exactly this. These people are worthless, bleating on about empathy while not giving a single address to all their lives their demands have ruined. </p>
<p>I'm about ready to snap. The constant anger is exhausting. Like really tiring can never sleep kind of tiring. Why go to sleep? Tomorrow is an empty day.</p>

        <p>That's nice.  I'm kind of the opposite but I actually like when random people talk to me usually.  It's totally unnatural behind a mask though, there's no way to tell who is being friendly without seeing their face or something.</p>

        <p>Lol I'm the same way. Back before this all started I had a few road rage incidents, nothing too big, usually once a month or so I'd flip my shit if a guy took too long at a green light or was drifting in and out of lanes. Dude always took off panicking when I started screaming threats. It was really frustrating. Have urban males always been such pussies?</p>

        <p>I've always had a general misanthropic attitude. Covid and the resulting insanity has all made me learn to love the people in my real life (no one I know buys into the new normal bullshit) and focus my misanthropy on the people who deserve it more (online mainly).</p>
<p>I'm happier than ever to tell the sheeple online to pound sand and would gladly do so in real life if their type were the norm where I lived too.</p>
<p>Humanity has dodged natural selection for a long time, the bill is coming due for that. We have too many idiots and sheeple running around now, more than what should be alive if natural selection still applied to us. That's just a fact. So don't feel too bad about being on edge, just try your best to direct your frustration where it's deserved.</p>
<p>These people pushing the new normal would gladly see your life ruined and you dead from poverty if it means they got to extend their stay at home NEET lifestyle another month, remember that.</p>

        <p>Yes, I screeched at these employees at my local grocery store a few days ago. They approached me with a complimentary mask but were so shitty about it. I refused nicely but they were pushy and said wear a mask or leave. The thuggish male employee (I assume, hard to tell with these libs anymore) was threatening me and under his breath told me “put on the mask or fucking leave.” I started screaming at him and felt like throwing the bread down on the floor and leaving. But I collected myself and left without incident. It’s very unusual for me and I felt ashamed of what I’d become too. I won’t be muzzled and I won’t give away my civil liberties though; I called him a brain washed fool as I was leaving.</p>

        <p>Wow! Theoretically they could do the same in England but if you tell them you are medically exempt and they make you leave, it's against the Equality Act. They aren't allowed to ask you what your medical conditions are routinely either. They can get fined for that. My problem is with members of the public and not establishments though. As I'm 5ft tall and weigh next to nothing I get picked on a lot but I don't care, I can barely breathe in the things. I'm not wearing them.  Definitely protect yourself, people are very unpredictable.</p>

        <p>Personally I'm more scared of strangers yelling things at me, so I prefer the "always be crazier" method.</p>
<p>I wouldn't yell because that just gets you in a viral Karen video, my plan is to just start hysterically crying as I always have a round of crying in my mental chamber and it would be really cathartic right about now to have a long public S C E N E of biblical weeping.  Imagine how much it would fuck up someone to think they were confronting someone on a mask outside (the only place it would happen) and get hit with the full tilt crazy of a woman weeping. No words, just weeping. </p>
<p>They could and probably would still yell more, which would only spur my subconscious on. It would ruin their whole week and ideally discourage them from the behavior in general. They wouldn't be able to videotape because nobody viewing that would think they won anything or validate them doing it. Best case they would freak out and turn tail immediately, worst case I have an opportunity for catharsis. I have real anxiety so the start of an anxiety attack usually gets mixed in there too which would be even more disturbing.</p>

        <p>This is my method. I just break down. Freaks people out. I am not in the most stable of spaces emotionally and can’t handle a lot. I cry when provoked. I was always told “don’t show someone they upset you that gives them the power” but I find very few people wanted to create a crying mess that they now feel slightly responsible for. I don’t mean to necessarily be this way but it is my defense mechanism. Once a lady screamed at my partner for being in the way at a gas station and for some reason I was in a very dark place and had an anxiety attack. I couldn’t control it I just started sobbing and saying please done hate me. She stopped and left looking very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The true goal is a lesson for the person confronting me that strangers are unpredictable which is why you don't get hostile with strangers unless there's a true emergency, but with an extra bonus of catharsis for me.</p>

<p>That's really it, isn't it?  </p>
<p>Where are all of these attitudes coming from that you can just get up in a stranger's face and expect that you get a moment of satisfaction being right, scot-free, as if this person you don't know is going to react as you expect them to - which is to walk away ashamed of themselves?  </p>
<p>Common sense basically tells me that you don't get up in a stranger's business unless they <em>clearly</em> need help, because you <em>don't</em> know how they're going to react to you, and even in the case where they need help, you might be getting in over your head really quickly.</p>

        <p>I genuinely believe that there is a fairly strong connection between the lack of these reactions (good old fashioned bar fight for instance) and the current climate. Long gone are the days when issues were sorted out in the traditional way that men and women sort things out, because God forbid we insult the feminists or the men who get their feelings hurt if someone confronts them, and even if it does happen, someone will just get sued. It's just given these fear mongerers all momentum they needed to put the world into the mess it's in.</p>

        <p>I feel like I'm going mad. I thought my father was a rather intelligent person, yet he seems to just accept tough restrictions and believes lockdown is the only way (but listens only to TV). He tells me he is "smart enough to filter all information", but he clearly has not seen even a quarter of what I have read from actual experts. I live in Italy, I don't know what will be left of this country in a few months. I live in a tiny village and see people walking, BY THEMSELVES, with a friggin mask ON. I've noticed my patience has halved and I have to shut myself up before making comments that would be hurtful to friends and family for being so blind. Never thought I'd live through such a surreal period of history at 26, with my dream of starting my life in Norway and finding a job there having been shattered in a matter of weeks. I'm staying with my parents to help them and support them financially and I just struggle to find hope nowadays...</p>

        <p>I always assert dominance when I enter an establishment without a mask. I look everyone in the eye and smile politely trying to remind them were humans. I've gotten dirty looks but never has anyone said anything. Aside from the dude that works at blaze pizza so I just smiled and left. Otherwise I walk in and am friendly with the staff and always look like fuck with me and find out...it seems to work very well. (I'm a female if that matters)</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say I was confrontational before this, but I always spoke my mind when I felt something was wrong.  So this is more of the same but hyper intensified.  Lately though I've been taking a step back.  I'm older and constant stress and anger isn't good for either my physical or mental health.  I'm still not wearing a mask or following bs restrictions I don't believe in but I'm more focused now on connecting with like minded individuals rather than trying to change anyone's mind.  The people who are driving alone with a mask or walking miles from anyone outside with a mask are too far gone.   I'm letting go of my anger towards them (although I blame them for so much of this mass hysteria) and just trying to live my life as restriction free as possible. It doesn't help my blood pressure to get worked up every time I see a masked up sheep hiking by themselves. They're still going to keep wearing a mask where it doesn't make any fucking sense to wear a mask and I'm still going to be angry.  It's better to just nod and keep going.</p>

        <p>I’m usually quiet and avoid confrontation, and always smile at strangers if we make eye contact. Not anymore. I stepped foot in a mall the other day and felt like I was defeating zombies in a video game as they (all middle aged women) yelled variations of “WHERES YOUR MASK!” at me and I blasted back “MEDICAL EXEMPTION”. From now on I’m just straight up saying mind your own business, Barbara.</p>

        <p>I always wear a mask when going into a business, because it's required, and even if it weren't, I respect business owners' right to enforce whatever rules they want. I'm not the type of person to make a scene when I'm on someone else's property - I chose to be there, and I can leave whenever I want, so I don't really have any right to complain. </p>
<p>If someone bothered me about not wearing a mask outside or in a public space, I would absolutely tell them to fuck off. But fortunately that hasn't happened yet even in the very liberal area I'm in.</p>
