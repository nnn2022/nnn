    <strong>Hey doomers guess what believe Covid is real</strong>
    <p><p>For everyone that likes to come in here and attack us for being "conspiracy theorists" let me just say one thing. Most of us believe Covid is real. We do think there is a virus out there that can be harmful and can be fatal.  </p>
<p>We just don't believe this is a pandemic crisis that the WHO or the media tell us it is. That Covid has been the SOLE reason why 500,000 plus are dead. You ever thought what would happen if you had Covid in your system, but you actually died from a car crash? They could list your death off as Covid related just for having the virus in your system. Not because you actually died from getting into an accident.  </p>
<p>Lockdowns don't work because people have already been outside. They just take the virus home with them and get their families sick. People have been getting sick from having to isolate themselves from one another. People have been getting mentally ill because of this pandemic. The virus just stays dormant for the duration of the lockdown and then continues to pass it around once people go back out.   </p>
<p>Oh and we can now make a case for how bad masks are doing for us. Anyone else wonder why the North is having a rise in cases while the South hasn't? Aside from Florida but one could argue people from all across the globe are using Florida as an escape or a break from their state. Travelers are more likely to get tested than the locals. Especially if you are traveling by plane.   </p>
<p>Also let me ask you this one doomers. How is it that all the sudden the flu isn't as deadly just because we "masked up" but we are seeing a rise in Covid cases? If Masks really work wouldn't the Flu &amp; Covid be down too? It's also been a while now since vaccines have been out. Most if not all of the people who were at the most risk for Covid have been vaccinated, passed away or now has antibodies. Now what all the sudden we have variants and anyone can be at high risk for Covid? Did you know the definition of a variant is? It's "a form or version of something that differs in some respect from other forms of the same thing or from a standard". I actually found an article about the variants and "all three variants are at least usually neutralized by those antibodies".   </p>
<p>Bottom line is don't put words in our mouths that we don't think Covid is real. We do actually believe it's around us and is infecting us. We just don't trust the media when it seems like everyday they feel like they need to remind us how bad it is.</p></p>
