    <strong>Prediction: We will "find out" the new vaccines reduce fertility</strong>
    <p><p>How many times have the cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIsTs been right this year?</p>
<p>Well, here's another prediction for you.  I would bet good money at some point going forward, they will "find out" this vaccine reduces fertility.</p>
<p>That's what this is.</p>
<p>Connect the dots, that's what's happening.</p>
<p>They know there is a population bomb, and they need to reduce it.  The climate, the oceans, the population, all too much.  We desperately need to reduce the population.  </p>
<p>The elite know they need to dramatically reduce the population, particularly in the poorer countries/neighbourhoods.  This is incidentally why they will start vaccinating these populations first (but frame it as having altruistic reasons).</p>
<p>Bill Gates' father was a eugenicist who wanted to reduce the world population.  Bill is following in his father's footsteps.  </p>
<p>They cannot simply wipe out billions of people, so instead they will make a certain percentage of the population less likely to have babies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/suspicions-grow-nanoparticles-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-trigger-rare-allergic-reactions">There are nanoparticles in the vaccine called polyethylene glycol (PEG)</a>.  </p>
<p>We will later "learn" these particles cause a reduction in fertility.</p>
<p>It may be worse than that.  Who knows.  This is just my prediction for now.  Be prepared to hear at some point "this vaccine reduces fertility".  </p>
<p>At first it will be a "cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrY".  Then it will be proven.  Then the taxpayers will be on the hook for reparations to these damaged individuals.</p>
<p>And when it is all over, the criminals to humanity who are responsible for this biological attack on the human genome will be laughing billionaires.</p>
<p>Fuck these people.</p></p>

        <p>World population is starting to plateau in the west, the average is is 45 in many places, hence the pension bomb problem. Over population is a myth. That’s why most western economies now rely on immigration to maintain production.</p>

<p>Doesn't follow they don't want to further reduce the numbers though and it wouldn't surprise me at all tbh</p>

        <p>I read an article saying animals given this type of vaccine died as soon as they got the wild strain of the virus they were vaccinated against.  Call me a Luddite but I don’t see how forcing your body to produce proteins your body doesn’t want us a recipe for disaster, my missus has an autoimmune disease (graves) and prior to being diagnosed she was in and out of the doctors with literally hundreds of different cocktails of drugs, did that bring on the condition?
. I’m not an anti vaxxer but the more I read the more I wonder if I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>Yes, same...it was ferrets...if I can find the study again I will post the link</p>
<p>I certainly won't call you a Luddite as I agree 100% - like your mrs I also have autoimmune thyroid disease but the opposite of hers - Hashimoto's - and it sure makes you wonder</p>
<p>I had to have Hep B vaccinations about ten years ago, I was given <em>nine</em> of the things (they kept saying my antibody test was showing non-immune) and my health has since gone <em>really</em> downhill...I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, muscle spasms beyond belief... can't brush my hair or even do my own bra up 🙈</p>
<p>When I actually looked into what goes into them I was horrified - you could call me an 'ex-vaxxer' - I think the term 'anti-vaxxer' is something of a misnomer in most cases</p>
<p>I mean, most people would balk at buying something off Joe on the corner and injecting it, yet trustingly hold their arm out for medics, without ever even thinking to ask what is in the shots...</p>

        <p>I've been considering this too, however there are some issues I have with this.</p>
<p>Mainly smog. This is a real problem clearly affecting large areas where people are gathered.(cities) 
This would indicate local overpopulation at the very least. This could also be explained by chemtrails if that's fake.</p>

        <p>Well true, but again smog is a symptom of over-consumption and population density, which is a separate issue from 'overpopulation' per se</p>
<p>Makes you wonder why the push to get so many people crowded into what will become their 'smart cities' and towns?</p>
<p>There is plenty of area and resources for everyone - it's the discrepancy in density and usage that's the problem</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's basically nonsense.  If we were to spread out instead of concentrating in big cities, there'd be no one around.  Most of the United States is still backwoods, and is Russia, China, and just about every other country on the planet.  Pollution is a problem, for sure, but that's more due to poor decisions than too many people. (For instance, we could have been using nuclear energy a lot more but people are afraid of doomsday and as a result we are warming the planet more)</p>

        <p>The third world is exploding in population and will eventually threaten the west even while our depopulation proceeds apace. To put this in context, Britain was able to conquer the world because of a surplus population it needed to resettle. Mass migration is really just another form of the same pattern and has the same challenges</p>

        <p>Bill Gates talks about depopulation constantly, guess who has donated millions to these vaccines.</p>
<p>They are pushing the narrative that COVID can make you infertile, so then scared people will get the vaccine and then years later they will be told they got it from COVID not the actual vaccine, it's crazy so many people are willingly going for this vaccine.</p>

        <p>There will be, it's just that we, as taxpayers will be paying for it, not big pharma. 
Look it up, in most developed countries the government is responsible for testing protocols so if they grant a harmful vaccine they have to pay up. But it gets passed to the taxpayer...so big pharma gets to profit and we get to suffer the costs of both harmful products as well as financial compensations.</p>

        <p>Yes. It’s been that way since at least the 1980s. Vaccine injury claims are paid out by the US government, not the pharma companies. I wonder if the recipients of these new vaccines would be eligible for compensation from that fund if they suffer adverse effects.</p>

        <p>I call children "crotchgoblins" and I would be glad to find out I'm infertile, yet I seem to be more radically against many restrictions/mandates - especially forced/coerced vaccination - than some others on this sub. Not trying to gatekeep, just trying to dispell the misconception that childfree introverted teens and 20-somethings are those calling for lockdowns and mandatory vaccination. Most people I've encountered who push for the restrictions/mandates are highly social middle-aged single parents who believe overpopulation is a myth.</p>

        <p>I agree that the crazier "demon alien lizard peoole" conspiracy theorists detract from those legitimately concerned with government/corporate corruption. Behavioral sink is also a major issue, and we already seem to be at that point. However, Bill Gates has his fingers in too many pies to ignore. Something suspicious is afoot and I don't think it's quite so benign as population reduction.</p>

Do they also know that we can reach cold fusion by removing the phlogiston, or that lockdowns are useless because spontaneous generation can just create more of the virus?

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348">Global overpopulation is a myth.</a> It is still a problem in third world countries in Africa and South Asia, however in already developed nations <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53409521">birth rates are plummeting</a> and the population will start shrinking. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=japan+population&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_en-GBGB705GB705&amp;oq=japan+pop&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39i457j0i20i263j0i433j46j0j0i20i263j0.1983j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">This can already be seen in Japan.</a></p>
<p>Decreasing fertility would actually be bad for pharmaceutical companies since it would mean they would have less customers to sell products too.</p>
<p>Massive population decreases also lessen the power of the elite. After the Black Death, so many peasants died that the remaining ones wage's increased as labour became in a shorter supply so lords had to cough up more money to attract more workers. The same thing would happen here. Why do you think corporations like immigration? So they can use cheap labour. Less labour is bad for them.</p>
<p>Finally, if the vaccine was shown to decrease fertility the reputations of the pharmaceutical companies would be in shambles and no one would want to by anything from them anymore. Sales would plummet. It wouldn't be in their interest to give everyone a vaccine they knew would cause infertility, that would just be signing a death sentence for their own business.</p>
<p>This conspiracy literally makes zero sense whatsoever. The people that believe in this a the real sheeple.</p>

        <p>A lot of people did lose faith in them. Hence why you just said that in your reply. The entire world is watching the how vaccine works however so any dishonesty would cause magnitudes more damage.</p>

        <p>Agree here except it doesn't have to function. Most likely the big side effects will be few, but not nonexistant. It's a part of the dividing tactic to make people freak out more than necessary and that's why they have their controlled ops spreading this fear.
We already see people suffering from them.</p>
