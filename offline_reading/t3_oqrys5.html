        <p>Those silly people.  You had a transparent President, but he was “voted” out. 
Now it’s back to the same old same old.  The guy saying he wants to get rid of all guns with more than one round, he said it, not me, is the same guy that was in office when they covered up fast and furious.</p>

        <p>I was making a joke with my last comment but this is 100% true. The faster people stop thinking that their side is the "correct" side the faster we can actually make impactful changes. </p>
<p>I do lean conservative, but that's my personal values which I know 99% of the people in Washington have no values, other than helping themselves and whatever lobby is paying them the most.  It really gets under my skin seeing people just shift their values to whatever narrative their party is pushing at the time. Just look at all the people who were against the vaccine when Trump was in office now completely ok with it.  It's not just the vaccine though, it's so many other things.  Are we still having a "crisis at the border"? Where did all those "kids in cages" go? Or did we stop giving a shit about the things going on that Biden (or any president) can't change easily.  </p>
<p>In reality it's all a bunch of BS to keep us divided along arbitrary lines (race, vax status, gender) instead of economic status. Nobody cares about someone's race, gender, sexuality anymore, unless they benefit from a divide.  Can you imagine if the poor and middle class were to get together on things? We outnumber the rich exponentially.  I don't mean that in a "give us their money" way but in a "stop screwing us over" way.</p>

        <p>No it's not better. But it's not going to change anything anytime soon. They all say one thing and do another. They're all self serving asshats. They all lone their friends pockets with tax payers dollars and restrict rights. And they all talk their stupid jerry springer bullshit come election time make promises they have no intention on keeping. So how do you know who to actually vote for? Because they all serve the same masters.... Corporations. Perhaps outlawing lobbying is a solution? Democracy has been an absolute joke the last ten years. And I served in the military and am very pro rights. To see my country and democracy get destroyed is disheartening to me because it's what I stood up to defend. But I drank their Kool-Aid wish I never did. Personally I feel democracy is failing because of corruption corporate influence.</p>

        <p>Corporate owners in my opinion. The war in Iraq and Afghanistan has made them a pretty penny at the cost of lives. The military industrial complex is what drives war and the economy. Watch..... America will go into a major recession, almost like the great depression and they will find a war to go fight against some horrible dictator. Look at Afghanistan now.... The Taliban have retaken the horn of the panjwai. The Canadian government isn't honouring their promises to the interpretors and abandoned them in Afghanistan and now they're getting decapitated along with their families by the Taliban. It was never about freeing Afghanistan. Well sort of freeing..... Their natural resources. Politics have become like a high school all over again. None of them actually work for us. They work for re election. Personally I think in North America we need the preferential voting system. Where you actually rank on your ballot your picks from first to last. Which eliminates strategic voting. But why would these corrupt piece of shit politicians bring in a system that threatens their re-election.</p>
