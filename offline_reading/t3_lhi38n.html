    <strong>How to make the world a better place</strong>
    <p><p>If you had the choice of working as a journalist for your country’s biggest media company, or as a school teacher in one of your largest schools, which of the two do you think could make the biggest positive impact ? </p>
<p>MSM across the board in Canada is still, believe it or not, dominated by boomers. You see it in almost every single article published by every single outlet - entitled, opinionated, out of touch journalists writing about a world that left them behind years ago. They write in absolutes, never cite their claims, never take risks, almost never admit when they’re wrong, probably still use landlines, Facebook, whatever... ask yourself, when was the last time you read an article that took a risk and made your jaw drop? </p>
<p>Anyways, do you think you’d have more success as a journalist who takes risks and goes against the grain? So long as you’re good at what you do and develop an audience? Or do you think you’d be doing the world a better favour by teaching kids how to think logically and how to assess the overwhelming amount of information available online these days rationally? </p>
<p>Personally, I think MSM is ripe for the picking. Would be interesting to see the old guard give way to new blood. Long term though kids definitely need help with learning the fundamentals.</p>
<p>Posting this as a simple thought experiment because we are all at a loss as to how so many people lack the most basic reasoning skills.</p></p>

        <p>Both of those professions are teaming with literal socialists/communists.</p>
<p>The milisecond I try to educate a child properly I would be fired for "extreme political opinions" and same for journalism.</p>
<p>The pendulum has swung too far for individuals to make a difference. We need cataclysmic event with a high deathtoll to shake the brainwashing away.</p>
<p>Then wash rinse repeat every few generations as we make the same mistake.</p>

        <p>Yes you are probably right unfortunately. Both education and creative writing are dominated by liberals. I guess I was inspired to write my post now because more and more liberals are making their way over to these subs. They’re tired of the confusion and annoyed with the insults, threats, meltdowns, etc that so commonly characterize conversations in left leaning subs. They’re red pilling or whatever you wanna call it. </p>
<p>Just seems to me like it would be an interesting and eventful career if you chose either of those two options and went against the grain.</p>

        <p>Yep for sure. But my point isn’t about what you and I do, or most people in this sub really. It’s about everyone else - the majority of the population - who never seem to criticize their government anymore and who just want to fit in.</p>

        <p>Interesting you should post a YouTube link cuss I considered online media platforms as such as alternatives to build an audience, but MSM is the root of the problem. It needs to change.</p>

        <p>Yeah activistpost and uncoverdc are good journalists too. Not sure which way they lean politically if any... it's easy to ignore from those sources and research things yourself since they share all their sources and ask important questions, unlike msm.</p>
