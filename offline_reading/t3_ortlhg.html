    <strong>Remember when it was cool to rebel against ‚Äúthe man‚Äù?</strong>
    <p><p>Pepperidge Farm remembers‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>This whole thing‚Äôs got me conflicted about society. Even most media we consume (movies, books, tv, music) contains some narrative going against ‚Äúthe man‚Äù aka the government. How come all the sudden people think the gov is there to help them??? I just don‚Äôt get it. </p>
<p>I really feel like the MSM / pro-vaxxers are just brainless NPCs ruining this open world paradise. How can we end this tyrannical brainwashing bullshit and build back the REAL better? Honest opinions only. </p>
<p>And no, to the jab-hungry snowflake brigade, I‚Äôm not inciting violence, so don‚Äôt twist the narrative.</p></p>

        <p>My city in USA has been mask optional for the vaccinated for over 2 months now. First 2 months in, snot diapers were a rarity to be seen at my local grocery store. Now all the sudden this week I go to the same place and I‚Äôm back to being one of the single digits without a mask on. WTF.</p>

        <p>All the 90s kids who wore black and hated the system are now embracing totalitarianism 100%.  WHY?</p>
<p>I feel like they never hated 'the man' at all and were just jealous of the man and wanted to be the man.  Well, the man has invited them up on his lap and they are loving every minute of it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think the way out of this mess is to give these people an important position ON THE GOOD SIDE.  The new generation has no purpose or point to their lives.  They aren't building.  They are wasting away.  Somehow we need to build something that they want to be apart of and feel important being apart of.  It's like every successful person needs to "adopt" a blue haired freak, put them in their basement, give them free cable, and sort of nurture them in to running their own business or something.</p>

        <p>As a 90s kid who wore black and said fuck the system a lot, I realised we had entered clownworld when a friend whose ear I once pierced with a safety pin at a dive bar punk gig started using the decorative covid propaganda frames on their profile pictures. </p>
<p>Like sure, we all have to grow up, but nearly everyone I know from that scene has slunk off to receive a salary from CorporationCorp and left nothing but <em>aesthetic</em> and hollow ideology for the new wave of "alternative" kids.</p>

        <p>I'm a 90's kid who still wears black and still says fuck the system,  and I say, no, they wouldn't recognize themselves. I think for them, the rebellion they practiced as teens was more about drugs and rebellion against their parents than it was against the system. They didn't know enough to care that much then, and they don't now.</p>

        <p>It's so interesting.  When you are part of a group, do others actually believe what you think they believe.  It's a huge let down to realize you were in a group that didn't even believe things you thought they did.</p>

        <p>Oof that's such a great question...</p>
<p>I think plenty of this crowd were posers that just evolved with every counterculture trend until they ended up where we are now, with semi-ironically bearded libdads thinking that sharing a Vice article is still edgy somehow. Those ones wouldn't have known how to fuck the system if it showed up in lingerie at 2am.
The particular friend that I referred to however...I don't know. I figured they'd be one of the people I could call to have the "wtf is going on here" conversation when things kicked off, but when I brought it up they just awkwardly changed the subject and the chat ended with a "stay safe during these unprecedented times."
I was pretty sure I was being trolled at that point, but nope. Bodysnatched.</p>

        <p>maybe people think being liberal is the new 'rebel', maybe people think that being a liberal means they are apart of the BLM riots, they are apart of a great rebellion and they are the hero of society.</p>

        <p>I have always considered myself to be liberal as well as most of my friends but I see them so willingly give up their freedoms and have such compliance. I always make sure to point out to people that I am not a republican or a Trump supporter  because that is what most people believe. I am however also not a Democrat anymore.</p>

        <p>I always thought I was a weirdo progressive leftist-type too, but one day in 2020 I woke up to learn that I am apparently an alt right extremist troglodyte. I'm not in the USA but this kind of divided thinking seems to be global at this point.</p>
<p>There are people I have watched conspiracy videos with, gone on pride marches or antifa demos with, even made meals for refugees with who now think I'm a brainwashed bigot because I called bullshit on the Rona narrative.</p>

        <p>So, in a nutshell, the System's neatest trick is this:</p>
<p>For the sake of its own efficiency and security, the System needs to bring about deep and radical social changes to match the changed conditions resulting from technological progress.</p>
<p>The frustration of life under the circumstances imposed by the System leads to rebellious impulses.</p>
<p>Rebellious impulses are co-opted by the System in the service of the social changes it requires; activists "rebel" against the old and outmoded values that are no longer of use to the System and in favor of the new values that the System needs us to accept.</p>
<p>In this way rebellious impulses, which otherwise might have been dangerous to the System, are given an outlet that is not only harmless to the System, but useful to it.</p>
<p>Much of the public resentment resulting from the imposition of social changes is drawn away from the System and its institutions and is directed instead at the radicals who spearhead the social changes.</p>

        <p>This is extremely true.</p>
<p>Further, I do believe the system "hands out" new things when it is no longer expensive for the elite to do so and will actually "distract" from receiving part of the actual advances that are there.  In other words, the elite just achieved, let's say, 10 trillion new dollars in wealth or other advances (healthcare advances, property advances, etc.).  Well, they are now interested in handing out $100 bucks to every person rather than give an actual share of that new wealth.  They can even have this new $100 be achieve by fake protest.  "Look guys, we rioted and now the elite have agree we are going to have $100 bucks each now!  What a win!" while it is nothing and may in fact BE LESS than what was given before considering inflation, etc.</p>

        <p>You'd think once the revolution achieves nothing, they'd wake up.  But the elite mask little gains as "wins and progress" when in fact these gifts/gains are likely now worth less due to inflation, etc.</p>
