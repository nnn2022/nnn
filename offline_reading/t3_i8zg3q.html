    <strong>Are things getting back to normal in real life?</strong>
    <p><p>Do you think that things are starting to get back to normal? Online, at times, it seems like there are still a LOT of people who are choosing to stay shut in. but when I look around in my actual setting, it seems like people are starting to willingly spend time together again after a lull. People are also sort of walking around more.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? What have you observed? Are people slowly edging back to the way things used to be?</p></p>

        <p>People are out, but they’re all wearing those useless masks. In Wisconsin it got a lot worse because the mask mandate was made by the governor to start the month, so now you see them everywhere. I still won’t wear one though.</p>

        <p>I went to a grocery recently outside my own state.
No masks on employees. Hardly any on customers. No signs about social distancing. Played normal musak the whole time, no "stand six feet away" stuff.</p>
<p>Afterward we went to get some lunch, and had a completely normal experience. Server took our drinks and refilled the cups, with our straws in them, without a hazmat suit.</p>
<p>No signs up about change shortages or cash not being accepted.</p>
<p>Self-serve drink station in convenience store operating normally.</p>
<p>It was hard to come home to the dystopian mask nightmare again. But normal does exist. And I cherished it.</p>

        <p>I'm from TN and people are masked up here like it's going out of style. You must have been WAY out there. I guess you don't want to drop the city, but you could at least say east/middle/or west because I can tell you middle TN is definitely consumed with democrat bs and masks.</p>

        <p>The daycare I drive by on my way to work has been packed with parents dropping their kids off for the past few weeks. I'm also noticing college age students out and about because our university is offering in person classes as well as online. The times I've been shopping stores seem normal, minus the masks.</p>

        <p>Besides the mask thing and having bars closed down, for the most part yes. Though I've noticed a lot of the nearby towns don't have people out and about because bars and restaurants are closed.</p>
<p>The grocery store is as busy as ever, ditto Home Depot, Walmart and all the other big box stores. I see people out running or biking, some with masks, but most without. Traffic isn't insane like it normally is but the roads aren't empty either. You won't hear it on the internet, but I get the feeling people around here are ready for shit to go back to normal.</p>

        <p>I don't feel things are back to normal. In my state, almost everything that is considered fun is still shut down. And almost every school in the state is refusing to open for in-person instruction. Some private schools are desperately trying to reopen but they are getting hammered and bullied into shutting down so who knows if they will actually stay open. </p>
<p>The only fun things we can do are the pool (but hours are restricted and you have to sign up in advance for a time slot), my toddler's parent/child gym classes (they only reopened due to a loophole they are taking advantage of) and illegally going to the playground (playgrounds are still "closed" but we go anyway). My 11 year old can't do anything - I am desperately trying to find her something to do. </p>
<p>Not to mention, you have to wear those fucking masks everywhere. As long as masks are part of this new normal, things will never be back to normal. I don't care how often people secretly get together with friends. Masks, schools being closed and cancelling large events will never be normal to me.</p>

        <p>I’m in the uk, and me and my girlfriend stayed at her place last week; very little distancing going on, saw about 5 people wearing masks all week, the restaurant she works at is operating at full capacity. We went to Stratford upon Avon at the weekend and it’s a similar story there, at least from what we saw and the places we visited. </p>
<p>Back in my town, things have re-opened and people are still out and about; mask compliance is a lot higher in the stores here though; like 90% at least, we still won’t wear one though, and no ones batted an eye apart from a few looks here and there. Other than that same story here too. </p>
<p>The university I’m starting at in the fall is preparing to offer blended learning but they’ve changed things slightly so that’ll there be a good amount of in person learning, and I’m hoping that by semester 2 (post Xmas) thing will be fully back to normal on that front too. </p>
<p>So yeah, things are definitely starting to move in the right direction, at least in my experience.</p>

        <p>Locally, sort of. Lots of families using the community pool and bbq's. Lots of kids and teenagers playing outside maskless. Beaches are open, and mostly maskless.</p>
<p>Beyond that, though, things are far from normal. I'm in CA for reference. Restaurants are outdoor only, so now you see giant white tents in parking lots everywhere. Gyms are still closed, as well as movie theaters, hair salons, and bars. Mask compliance is 100% indoors, and surprisingly high outdoors too, like 90-95%.</p>
<p>We were way more open in June, then did a 180 in July. Now i have literally no idea when i can start doing fun things again.</p>

        <p>Not at all. There was a brief period early on where everyone literally was staying home, barely a car in sight outside. Traffic is back to normal and most things have "reopened", but there are restrictions galore and now we have mask mandates... months after the peak came and went, which never overwhelmed any hospitals here.</p>

        <p>No. Mask compliance is going up in my area, a zoo I was really excited to visit has permanently closed the children's zoo because COVID, and all those young people who died from suicide and overdoses are just as dead as the old people who died from the rona. Any "normal" you see is a facade. They turned the bullshit up to 11, so of course a 10 seems "normal" in comparison.</p>

        <p>I'm in the rural midwest, and it is like the new abnormal barely ever got here in the first place. People still shake hands, etc. I am very grateful to be here. I'll see about one in 100 people in a mask, and the only weirdness is at Walmart.</p>

        <p>In Ontario, Canada, mostly, except for the stupid masks indoors. At least they're only indoors, although the occasional nutter voluntarily wears one inside. Some businesses still won't take cash, and the distancing/traffic control markings are still on the floors.</p>
