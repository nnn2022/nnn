    <strong>Are there any reports/statistics about *masked* armed robberies being on the rise?</strong>
    <p><p>It seems like armed robbers would be taking advantage of being able to hide their identities much easier now that masks are so ubiquitous. </p>
<p>I'd bet anything that convenience/liquor store-type robberies are through the roof now. Pre-Covid, if a store clerk saw someone walk through the door wearing a mask, he/she would be alarmed instantly and be able to retreat, defend or otherwise foil the robbery attempt. Likewise, someone leaving a store with a mask on would raise suspicions among nearby witnesses. </p>
<p>That's all out the window now. Welcome to the New Normal.  </p>
<p>I'm sure these robbery statistics exist <em>somewhere</em>, but I'm sure government officials and the media don't dare discuss the increase in this type of crime, as it would put the mask policies in a negative light.</p></p>
