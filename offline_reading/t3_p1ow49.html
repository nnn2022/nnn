    <strong>I think I’ve officially black pilled</strong>
    <p><p>I’m really struggling, everything looks so grim. I can’t escape the craziness. I’m afraid my job will mandate vaccines and I will need to quit. I have worked for 8 years to get my dream job. I put in the long hours, I’ve taken the harder roles, physically worked myself to exhaustion because I wanted a specific job so badly. I finally got it 6 months ago, and now I’m being treated like a second class citizen because I don’t want a vaccine that could possible give me a long term autoimmune disorder (very strong genetic tendency for that). New mandates at work come out every Friday, and every Friday I sit in fear thinking “this will be the day”. There aren’t a lot of options for what I do (roughly retail design), and I honestly love what I do. Everything feels out of control, and I feel hopeless. Every week I get a longer list of restrictions, while everyone sees me as the enemy. I have one similar minded friend at work, and he’s leaving. I’m alone.</p></p>

<p>Never act irrationally/emotionally.</p>
<p>If you are "forced/coerced" by your employer to get the vaxx:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you get everything in writing and save all the documents. </li>
<li>Talk to a lawyer</li>
<li>Get a medical check-up <strong>BEFORE</strong> the vaxx (if you decide to take it)...in case you need to prove in court that the Vaxx was responsible for any adverse effects you may have.</li>
<li>Keep your lawyer (and close family members) informed of everything you are doing. keep a detailed journal if you can.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately it is your decision.....however keep in mind that there are PLENTY of jobs out there....and you employer knows it as well!</p>

        <p>I feel for you, and it’s terrible that you feel alone.  I assure you that you are not, but social pressures have made it seem so.</p>
<p>I’m happy to listen if you need to vent or just chat.</p>
<p>And remember, you have the power to change the situation.  You worked hard to get the dream job, I think a company that has values like you, does exist and would allow you to continue.  However you might have to move to get that</p>

        <p>I feel this dude.. they offered incentives for the vaccine at work and I'm afraid of where it will lead if enough people do it. I fear that it is just a clever way of getting a headcount of who is/isn't vaccinated so they can eventually cull those who aren't if a reasonable amount get the vaccine. I am hoping for low numbers by the deadline. </p>
<p>I have been seeing people wearing masks again at the store and it is honestly disheartening, there were a few months where masks were the extreme minority but it feels like early pandemic again. It's just fucking depressing. </p>
<p>Try to stay strong, keep the mask off and stick to your principles.</p>

        <p>There are so many incentives where I work for the vaccine. They also allowed the vaccinated to remove their masks for about a month (you had to submit your vaccine card in order to remove your mask). This revealed who has vaccinated and who wasn’t. Then they started imposing these crazy requirements for unvaccinated (like I am required to fully sanitize my house daily… like wtf). If I show ANY symptom of being sick it’s an automatic 10 day quarantine out of my saved sick time, but the vaxxed are literally all running around sick as dogs and they are allowed to work. (And just keep getting each other sick… but they have the vaccine so it’s fine apparently). After about a month they reinstated masks, but they all know who has the vaccinated and who doesn’t. I have a vacation planned, and I have to quarantine after it (vaxxed don’t). They are not allowing me to work from home for those 10 days (even though they initially said I could) so I have to use up the last of my PTO. It’s a mess, I have been a loyal hard worker for 8 years.</p>

        <p>This really sucks and is cruelty. I'm so sorry. I know I personally have started to feel high levels of anxiety and doom, and this is exactly what they want. It's sociopathic abuse.</p>
<p>Turning your anger into constructive action can help. Start researching potential employers who have not put these measures in place. Even if you have to move.</p>
<p>We have to figure a way to help people find new jobs. Maybe a subreddit.</p>
<p>If you want to share which retailer you work for, I'd be happy to boycott. I'm in Texas and can help figure which retailers here are not complying.</p>

        <p>Same. Worked many long hours (still do) for my dream job. I’ve sacrificed so much and now it feels like everything is out of control. I’ve put my life on hold for years to achieve my goals and in early 2019 everything fell into place. And within months the world was in disarray. Just trying to keep my chin up and thank God for each day I still have my health (not worried about Covid just thankful in general) and people that love me.</p>

        <p>The weekends are brutal my friend, I'm right there with you. Currently in warp speed looking for a job, any job, to save up as much cash as possible before it's too late. It's no secret that this upcoming Autumn is going to be a time of trial. An imploding economy, food shortages which are only going to get worse, whole industries will be brought to their knees by those unwilling to get poked. Take solace in our shared struggle, all of us here, on this sub. I don't know what the near future holds, nobody truly does, but I know that millions of angry, scared, hungry, poor people is a force which no power in history has been able to hold back. Take the high road, bite your tongue, and bide your time. We must stand together in peace to stop these masters of war.</p>

        <p>Take a few deep breaths. Understand that your life will not be over if you loose your job. Your life will not be over if you have to sacrifice your comfort. Think about all that your ancestor had to sacrifice or how much Unknown was happening for them. We must grieve and then find strength with in ourselves. When one door closes another one opens. Perhaps you could find someone who loves to sew and make a small sustainable clothing brand. Power to the people!
The only pathology is victim-hood.</p>

        <p>Thank you, and I know it won’t be over. It’s just hard to watch 8 years of hard work slip away. My heart hurts for those who are in similar situations and I want to help everyone as best I can. And trust me, I won’t go down without a fight.
