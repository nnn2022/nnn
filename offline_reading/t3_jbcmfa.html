    <strong>I dont even know what to say anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>Thank you guys for this sub ❤️ you are keeping me sane. Our country is legit establishing a totalitarian regime. People here are dying and losing their livelihood and our prime minister is threatening us that he will make it worse if we dont comply. No more than 6 people can meet at once and masks are MANDATORY OUTSIDE with a 1000€ fine if your sorry ass just wanted to breathe that dangerous covid filled clean air. And that is if you're lucky. You can LEGIT GO ON PROBATION AND POTENTIALLY JAIL if you refuse to wear a mask.  Now rumors are that vaccination will be mandatory and their plan is to use military units to enforce our "new rules". And of course the lockdown is in the air ! (well except for covid that is) Our PM said that if people refuse to wear masks a "complete lockdown of our country" is the only option. Problem is that...people. are. wearing those DAMNED MASKS EVERYWHERE. It didn't occur to him that masks are useless. Or that pcr tests are useless. He doesnt care about science. He (and many others in our government) are just trying to completely destroy this country for their own personal gain (also our president is backing our government up because she's also all in to gain a few ten's of thousands € from people's misery...) This country (along with our neighbors) are hit really hard by covid. But not covid as that "deadly desease that is for sure worse than a flu...just dont look up the stats". No no no. Covid is something different and its not a disease. Its a way that your government manipulates you and your constitution and all your laws and your freedom. It's a tool. It's not a deadly disease. Hardly anyone is dying purely from covid ESPECIALLY these days. It's a thing that has the power to turn your country into a dictatorship and IF YOU DARE to disagree you will immediately regret it. They will fire you. They will make you suffer. And if you don't have an independent source of income you are done for. Yes by the way this is also happening in my country. The anger that i have inside me is immeasurable and my day is ruined. I just want to warn you guys. Protest against this lunacy. Show that you won't comply...do anything. Because in this country its reeeaally bad. And its gonna get worse. I just hope you all stay safe....not from covid. But from your government. That's the real problem. </p>
<p>Ps: Keep this sub up ! Scientific publishings that you guys have shared here helped me a lot in....debates...with doomers. It's a shame that as soon as i present them with simple facts amd logic they do not want to talk to me anymore. Or better yet- they call me a murderer or a fascist....while they are actually being the ones that are implementing some principles of fascism.</p></p>

        <p>I 100% agree with you. This whole coronaconspiracy is about control. I just wonder- when will it stop ? People need to fight for their freedom that's for sure. But at least in my country there are just so many people that are scared shitless from this that i dont know if it's possible. They were totally brainwashed and now have autonomy of a dishwasher. Man... there's so much anger inside of me its brutal.</p>

        <p>Hah i wish. Heard that it's getting better there. But no. I am from Slovakia. And its a total shithole. It has been a shithole for some time now. But that was a "its not good but i can still live here" type of shithole. Now its just complete lunacy in here. And in czech republic its pretty bad too. We are not Czechoslovakia anymore but we're still together in our own twisted ways.</p>

        <p>Well, the rest of Australia is OK, but Victoria and Melbourne are still under complete lockdown, I believe. Police were shoving people in the streets for not wearing masks outdoors, and people can only travel 5 km from home.</p>

        <p>Thats exactly what a lot of people are saying in my country. We should run that asshole out of the country. The thing is i don't know how many sane people are left and if it's enough. Most of my country has already been brainwashed. But there is a protest that should be of huge proportions coming up in two days. I think its our last chance. It certainly feels like it.</p>
