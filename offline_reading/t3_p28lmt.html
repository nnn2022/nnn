    <strong>How's the mood in France? Is a great revolt coming? Or people will follow the rules?</strong>
    <p><p>I was watching videos on what's happening there. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jIqPzA2G1E&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jIqPzA2G1E&amp;t=1s</a></p>
<p>Businesses could be forced to close for 7 days if they don't vaccinate people.</p>
<p>I would like to ask what's the mood of the people? What do people think about all this?</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p></p>

        <p>Hello from southern France. </p>
<p>I can only speak from my experience in a small city, but the attitude of the great majority of people seems to be, "beh, c'est comme ça!". (Well, that's just the way it is!)  </p>
<p>Despite the reports of protests (in which i take part), those of us who oppose this madness are a very small but vocal minority, and the majority attitude is meek acceptance. At least in my city, the cafés and bars are still crowded, people happily scanning their QR codes so that they can have a beer. </p>
<p>As sign of the stunning level of compliance : Yesterday, while ordering lunch at a restaurant's street window (take-out is exempted from the pass) I saw people in line eagerly offering up their QR code to the cashier, without even being asked. Some of them even seemed annoyed that the cashier told them it was unecessary. WTF</p>
<p>Restaurant and bar owners seem annoyed that they have to "be the police", but they're too scared to resist; the financial penalties are too heavy. (In addition to immediate financial consequences, I imagine that having a pass sanitaire infraction on their record could make them ineligible for financial aid during future lockdowns, too.) The manager of my regular café had told me that he would not enforce the "bullshit" pass and that I would be welcome, but when I approached yesterday he apologised profusely when refusing me service, and repeated over and over, fearfully, "j'ai pas le choix".  (I have no choice)</p>
<p>As for the mood on the trains, I don't know. I stopped taking the train when they imposed the mask, and have, since then, enjoyed the most amazing european road trips.  :)</p>
<p>Our cute little protests are not doing any good. Macron, Véran, Castex &amp; company make no secret of their utter contempt for those who refuse the vaccine and/or oppose the pass sanitaire. Macron has even compared unvaxed people to drunk drivers, so the demonization is in overdrive. </p>
<p>At this point, we need massive resistance and civil disobedience from the vaxxed and the unvaxxed, standing in solidarity against the pass. If huge numbers of people simply stopped going to restaurants and cafés, the restauranteurs would raise hell and the govt would be forced to step back. If we staged massive sit-ins, not only in restaurants but in places like libraries, and let people watch as peaceful protestors are carted off by the police, maybe that would wake people up. </p>
<p>I won't hold my breath waiting for that, because as far as i can tell, most people here don't care, or at least they don't care enough to inconvenience themselves. </p>
<p>Sorry, but my mood is rather dark right now.</p>

<p>Do you have access to food? Can an unvaccinated person in France get access to food right now?</p>
<p>It's very depressing but hang in there. I know we will win.</p>

        <p>We're still allowed in supermarkets, and we can get take-out orders if we don't go inside the restaurant, so we can still eat.  phew! lol</p>
<p>One bright note ... i found a restaurant in a small village in the mountains, they didn't ask me for the pass. What a relief. The bonus was that the food was superb and the service was exceptionally warm and friendly for France.  I'll be going back to that village for dinner as much as possible.  :)</p>

        <p>Are the laws set for a finite period of time or are they permanent?</p>
<p>My country is preparing the pass, too, even that now we know already there is no point from health perspective :(</p>

        <p>Good question. The pass sanitaire law as it stands right now is set to expire November 15, 2021.  However, if people really believe that it won't be extended well beyond that, they've got their head hopelessly stuck up their ass. We're still in a "temporary" state of emergency originally declared in March 2020. AND, Macron stated, in no uncertain terms, in 2020 that there would never be a pass sanitaire in France and that the vaccine would never be mandatory. Oh, and remember "two weeks to stop the spread" ?</p>

        <p>This warning is, to put it delicately, total bullshit. </p>
<p>There is no "civil unrest". There are peaceful but sometimes loud protests twice a week, that's it. The protests are bigger and maybe noisier in Paris, with some minor clashes with police, but nothing out of the ordinary or dangerous. </p>
<p>There is no violence, no looting, no arson, no looting, none of those 'dangers' mentioned in the bullshit warning. It seems our protests against the pass are far more peaceful than the Americans' BLM protests last summer.</p>
<p>In Paris, petty criminals pose a far greater danger to tourists than any protest.</p>
<p>Apart from the dystopique ambiance created by the pass sanitaire and the mask still being required in all public places, life goes on as normal.</p>
<p>And then there's the scary terrrrrist boilerplate. Notice how it's worded:  </p>
<p>"terrrrrist groups continue plotting <strong>possible</strong> attacks in France .... <strong>may</strong> attack with little or no warning ... etc"  </p>
<p>Just like for the last 20 years. YAWN</p>
<p>The only terrrrrist threat the French people face is from their own government.</p>
<p>Don't believe any of this trash from the State Department</p>

        <p>I just read this absurd garbage, and here's a copypasta of the juicy bits so that people won't need to click on the link. </p>
<p>&rt;Do not travel to France due to COVID-19. Exercise increased caution in France due to terrorism and civil unrest.</p>
<p>&rt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for France due to COVID-19 indicating a very high level of COVID-19 in the country.  There are restrictions in place affecting U.S. citizen entry into France. Your risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA authorized vaccine. Before planning any international travel, please review the CDC’s specific recommendations for fully vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers.</p>
<p>&rt;Country Summary: Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in France. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.</p>
<p>&rt;Demonstrations in Paris and other major cities continue in France and are expected to continue in the coming weeks. Property damage, including looting and arson, in populated tourist areas has occurred with reckless disregard for public safety. Police have responded with water cannons, rubber bullets, and tear gas. The U.S. Embassy is advising official U.S. government travelers to avoid travel to Paris and other major cities in France on the weekends.</p>

        <p>The general mood in France right now is  <em>Paris vaut bien une messe</em></p>
<p>What does this mean? Interesting story that is very well known here ...</p>
<p>In 1593, the protestant Henri IV of Navarre inherited the French throne. However, the Catholics, with whom the protestants had been at war for decades, did not recognize his authority, so he had to change religion to become King. He publicly renounced Protestantism and converted to Catholicism in a ceremony at the Saint-Denis Basilica, declaring, <em>Paris is worth a mass!</em>  (Paris vaut bien une messe!)</p>
<p>The attitude of most people towards the pass sanitaire is like this. It's a pragmatic attitude, not based on any conviction or any belief in the necessity or not of having a pass sanitaire.</p>
<p>Looking at it in another way, we could also say that this is the attitude of collaborators .....</p>
