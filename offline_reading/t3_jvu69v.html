        <p>I am not a child technically (recently turned 21)</p>
<p>But as soon as these mask mandates hit, the thick coverings my work suddenly insisted we wore were causing me to have severe trouble breathing, along with one of my coworkers who actually had asthma.</p>
<p>After a long, lightheaded day and finally getting ONE break... I woke up on the public bathroom floor, still masked up and everything. I tried calling for help several times with no response. Eventually I just got a banging on the bathroom door "ARE YOU DONE IN THERE YET?"</p>
<p>I have a very hazy memory of what happened before. Not a doctor but I remember getting VERY lightheaded that day and feeling like I couldn't breathe well, coincidentally right after the mandate supposedly.</p>
<p>I have a history of my body crashing like that when I become overstimulated or malnourished, dehydrated etc. All I can remember before that was struggling to breathe, then next thing I know I woke up in a puddle of urine.</p>
<p>Regardless of if that was caused by a mask or not, that's not okay. Nobody even cared, just wanted me to get back to work in my pee-stained uniform. Couldn't even remember the names of my coworkers for 20-30min and ended up storming out, hoping that the mandate would end in two weeks like they said it would.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. Now imagine what we're putting "children" through almost a year later.</p>
