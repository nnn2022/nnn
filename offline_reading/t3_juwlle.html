        <p>I’m a scientist (MS in microbiology).  We have ZERO reasonable ability to be making policy decisions and the politicians who do are twisting what little scientific evidence we do know to support their own narratives.</p>

        <p>This is the most retarded 'hot take' I've ever heard.</p>
<p>Scientists have a long-standing reputation of <em>not</em> bowing to political pressure, especially when the truth is inconvenient for politicians (as we are seeing right now).</p>
<p>The opinions in this sub have been put forth by morons with the collective brainpower of a walnut.</p>
<p>We'll get through this pandemic in spite of your idiocy, not because you're some 'freedom fighters' or whatever the fuck you think you're doing.</p>

<p>Covid-19: politicisation, “corruption,” and suppression of science</p>
<p>&rt;Politicisation of science was enthusiastically deployed by some of history’s worst autocrats and dictators, and it is now regrettably commonplace in democracies. The medical-political complex tends towards suppression of science to aggrandise and enrich those in power. </p>
<p>One of the top science journals agrees.  Many studies, opinions, and scientists are being suppressed in the name of politics and self interest.  Read the article, you might learn something about the world.</p>

        <p>Bro I don't think you even work in Academia. If you did you wouldn't have said something so stupid. Most scientists are intelligent, when you are intelligent you realize that there's no point in picking a heroic battle that you'll loose. Ergo,most scientists are conformists and many are also cowards. I think you are not an academic.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  They are cowards that stick with the status quo.  Why take a chance of.killing your career that you've heavily invested in (years of study, work experience) when you can take the easy way out and skirt the truth a bit?  People think scientists are these super rational nonbiased beings, but they are human like the rest of us.  They like money, power, comfort.</p>

        <p>The virus hasn't even been proven to exist.  No test can detect it.</p>
<p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>(page 38)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.  •The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.•The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.•This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</p>
<p>(page 39)</p>
<p><strong>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available,</strong> assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza.  Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage.  The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April.  That was proven without any doubt.  Influenza kills children and young adults.  Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it?  Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you?  I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And here is an article from the New York Times that states that 90% of all covid tests should have been negative.  That's 90%!!!!  So no one is dying of covid!</p>

<p>This is a request that was made asking for documentation on Covid-19 being isolated- the request was denied because no such evidence exists.  No one has yet proven this virus exists!</p>

        <p>Umm ... I'm a science "nerd," and I would never have supported anything like this. Some of us do have consciences.</p>
<p>As for this panic making us cool, that's only true when we support the doomers. When I refused to do so, somebody tried to doxx me and threatened me with real world consequences. This is a terrible time to be an honest mathematician. Maybe the worst ever.</p>

        <p>Yeah me too.  I've cut out friends and family because I don't want them in my lives.  I'd rather never talk to them again than pretend to buy into their bullshit.  I've no room for cowardice in my life.</p>

        <p>You're right.  You have to stand up for the truth if no one else is.  I know it hurts my social life and career opportunities to speak up but I do it anyway.  Because it's fear that keeps the truth hidden.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've grown to hate people in the medical field.  They're the people who are supposed to know better yet they keep preaching this shit.</p>
<p>Medical labs perform tests that are proven to not work at diagnosing any virus, let alone one that hasn't even been isolated, and doctors who have, for their entire career, told us that masks don't provide viral immunity are now preaching that they will completely make you immune to infection (which we all know is untrue).</p>
<p>Doctors diagnose patient after patient with covid-19 despite the CDC's reports that the virus is identical to influenza!</p>
<p>I've seen doctors turn away patients that need medical treatment because they got a positive covid test (again- tests can't be used to diagnose covid).  Doctors are leaving patients to die for fear of a virus that hasn't even been proven to exist.</p>
<p>Hospitals have also shut down all treatments that don't involve covid which means if you need treatment for anything but covid, you're considered an "elective procedure" and told to stay home.</p>
<p>The entire medical field has failed us this year.  The medical field is killing people by the millions and they consider themselves to be "cool"?   The thought makes me sick to my stomach and I'm ashamed to actually be working in a hospital.</p>
