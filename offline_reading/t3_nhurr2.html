    <strong>Any College/College-bound Students Here?</strong>
    <p><p>This post is in no way restricted to just College/College College-bound students, it's just that I wasn't able to make it to the New Jersey Rutgers protest today. I was thinking of it as a chance to speak to others my age who think similarly to me there and I missed it... I am currently 18 now and my friends, well, I lost track of them after highschool. Although, from what I've heard from them recently over some texts here and there they are completely for the lockdown, the masks and this rushed vaccine because they still believe that their compliance will grant them freedom. I can't blame them, alot of them started college early, so they've been going online to this point and would do anything to go in person. I have just recently been accepted into Penn State and am due to start June 30th. They haven't mandated the vaccines yet, but it seems like they're toying with the idea..</p>
<p>So I guess I would just like to know the experiences, feelings or opinions of any other College/College-bound Students here?</p></p>

        <p>college student in Chicago here. currently, my state school has not mandated it to return but many private schools are requiring it to come back in campus next semester. </p>
<p>congrats on getting into Penn state btw! even if they end up requiring it, you SHOULD be able to get a religious/philosophical exemption.</p>

        <p>Thank you! Yeah I was thinking about using religious exemption because I do go to church with my Mom every Sunday. However the pastor of that church just went to go get his vaccine. Even though he made it clear that he only got to continue to travel and that no one is required to get it to continue going to church that kind of throws any chance of that exemption out the window..so I guess I'd have to shoot for philosophical.</p>

        <p>Hi I'm in my second year of college but I'm not American so my experiences are totally different from yours probably. My university is public so I'm not sure if it the vaccine will be mandated yet as they can't throw the "it's a private business they can do what they want" argument. Keep us updated if the situation changes!</p>

        <p>Yeah, it would seem like that would be the bargaining point of a good amount of colleges..I'll definitely update this post if they change their mind(although I hope I really won't have too &rt;~&lt;)</p>
