Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>

"As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets."

<p>https://www.ernestdempsey.com/bacterial-pneumonia-and-other-health-risks-of-wearing-masks-alarm-doctors/#:%7E:text=Dr.%20Meehan%20said%20that%20reports%20from%20around%20the,suffer%20reduced%20oxygen%20supply%20due%20to%20wearing%20masks
There have been numerous studies/experiments/demonstrations that have showed that masks do not prevent oxygen from going through the mask. Oxygen as a molecule is MUCH MUCH MUCH smaller than the smallest thing ANY mask prevents, including COVID. So small, that it easily passes through the mask. I think the people that struggled just have weak breathing muscles (diaphragm) or are just out of shape. WHO also said it does not cause carbon dioxide intoxication and does not prevent oxygen from reaching your lungs. What they did say however, is to cycle masks (don't reuse disposable ones) and to change masks as soon as they become damp, or even take extra measures to prevent dampness.
(https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/masks-oxygen-levels)
https://journaltimes.com/opinion/letters/blaski-regarding-masks/article_c8e5b766-1ee5-5320-8508-620b00d60639.html
This article, which was not in your links, says that the same doctor as your source (Meehan) said that uneducated mask wearers are wearing non-sterile masks, without changing/cycling the masks. Once again, this is not the fault of the masks, but the fault of the wearers. This opinion article states that masks "increase transmission", but includes no sources, no studies, and nothing to support their claim.</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/
This just says that medical masks are much better than cloth masks, which is obvious. Proper, tightly woven, multilayer (&rt;2 layers) cloth masks come near medical masks though, although the cloth masks will become damp easier without additional measures, like having a second mask to contain the moisture. It said washing hands significantly helps though.</p>
<p>Overall, these sources provide unrelated reasons for why masks do not work, and none of them say that proper masks and proper mask wearing do not are not effective against COVID-19. They also say that people with masks tend to disregard other guidelines like washing hands, allowing spread to others who touch the same surfaces and then touch their noses/faces. Guidelines work if they are all followed (washing hands, wearing mask, avoiding close contact) They argue that proper education is required for mask wearing, and in mask selection and maintenance. Please read your sources before you copy and paste links, and look at the data before you draw incorrect conclusions that "masks are anti-science and don't work". Drawing all the wrong conclusions and failing to even read past the title of these articles is truly anti-science, and people who do so, like you, are threats to society (if people care to listen to someone unqualified like you). As a person commenting on something scientific, you have to approach the article objectively, reading completely through their methods and results to see how trustworthy the study is and what the study is saying. These sources suggest improvements to mask wearing protocols, and do not discredit their value. They emphasize the importance of washing your hands a lot, and distancing yourself from others at all times. But the people that don't want to wear masks are likely to not distance themselves or wash their hands either, completely going against what these scientists are saying to do.</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320310439
6 studies across 4 countries revealed that masks significantly prevent transmission of COVID-19</p>

        <p>&rt;N95 and medical masks do. Medical masks don't get wet all the way through.</p>
<p>Medical masks don't even work in surgery bud.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/">However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination. More rigorous contemporary research is needed to make a definitive comment on the effectiveness of surgical facemasks.</a></p>
<p>&rt;This source you linked literally says more masks are needed, and the the experiment didn't work because not enough wore masks.</p>
<p>The authors bitching out due to the fear of being cancelled isn't proof of anything. You need to look at the data.</p>
<p>&rt;People need to wear real masks that work</p>
<p>No masks work.</p>
<p>&rt;"The results might change when further evidence becomes available.</p>
<p>See above. They're not willing to state that masks don't work due to the political ramifications. You need to look at the data. Not the opinions.</p>
<p>&rt;However, people don't always wear the mask correctly, and might touch the mask</p>
<p>Duh. I have a month old mask in my pocket. Anyone like me that has a pocket mask, has the inside of that pocket layered with germs. As well as the hand that grabs it also layered. If masks ever worked at all, we'd have biohazard bins everywhere. We do not. </p>
<p>&rt;With proper education and explanation of proper mask wearing, it would be effective.</p>
<p>People can't even signal correctly.</p>
<p>&rt;They say the reason medical masks are not effective are that they are loose fitting, while the CDC says that masks should not be loose fitting.</p>
<p>And that's Racist. Many people cannot shave due to physical issues or religion. You will never get a tight fitting mask with a beard. </p>
<p>The CDC also says that people should exercise regularly, yet people seem to have ignored that CDC judgement. </p>
<p>&rt;This is why the CDC recommended "double masking", in order to cover the gaps that can be there with only one.</p>
<p>No, the entire double making movement came from Fauci who claimed it "just made sense." This is the same guy who says they didn't work, at all.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.</p>
<p>Keep in mind he didn't say "Masks work, but save them for the healthcare workers.". No, he said they don't work. </p>
<p>Then he said they do work. </p>
<p>And now, only <em>now</em>, they're double masking? </p>
<p>Where was this advice a year ago?</p>
<p>&rt;This source and the sources it cites state that masks should work, but people don't practice proper mask wearing</p>
<p>Which will never happen.</p>
<p>&rt;When in used for errands, people won't spend more than 20 minutes in a store anyway.</p>
<p>People work in stores. This may be news to people like you, but the box of honey nut needed to be put there by someone wearing a mask for 8 hours a day. Let alone 20 minutes. </p>
<p>&rt;However, the mask does its job, which is REDUCING spread of the virus</p>
<p>By less than 2%.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm">"Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease [...] in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1–20 days after implementation and decreases of [...] 1.8 percentage points [after] 81–100 days."</a></p>
<p>Either 98% of cases happen reguardless of masks, in which case masks don't work, or 98% of cases happen in a manner that masks don't stop.</p>
<p>Given surface transmission is all but a myth at this point, we can go ahead and say masks don't work.</p>
<p>&rt;which again, doesn't prove that masks don't work</p>
<p>The fact masks don't work is why masks don't work.</p>
<p>&rt;Don't wear a cloth mask, wear a proper mask. Cycle cloth masks instead of immediately reusing them.</p>
<p>Cloth masks are fully allowed by the guidelines and are treated as if they're just as good. </p>
<p>Unless you have a commercial grade hospital style high temp washer, there's also no evidence to suggest the mask is ever properly cleaned.</p>
<p>&rt;Overall, an untrustworthy study with lots of holes and potential biases.</p>
<p>Better than the studies that use a sterile mask in a sterile environment and claim they work. It is at the very least an actual real world study using human error to showcase why masks don't work.</p>
<p>&rt;masks due offer some degree of protection.</p>
<p>Unless you're wearing goggles, that's not the case.</p>
<p>&rt;There have been numerous studies/experiments/demonstrations that have showed that masks do not prevent oxygen from going through the mask.</p>
<p>A reduction in air flow will always reduce gasses. Doesn't matter how small the particles are, a reduction in overall airflow will reduce quantities. </p>
<p>Shove a bunch of stuffing in your car's air intake and see how well it runs. </p>
<p>Even that deadass idiotic "test" of blowing out a candle while wearing a mask shows this is true. </p>
<p>Get a grip bud.</p>
<p>&rt;WHO also said</p>
<p>I don't care about anything the WHO says. They're a paid off organization that's so far in China's pocket it's laughable. They won't even talk about Taiwan. </p>
<p>&rt;said that uneducated mask wearers are wearing non-sterile masks, without changing/cycling the masks.</p>
<p>Human error will never go away. People can't drive properly. The fact you think that a universal given its somehow a point is laughable.</p>
<p>&rt;and none of them say that proper masks and proper mask wearing do not are not effective against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Many of them say that. You just ignored it by blaming the result on offer aspects, or by completely ignoring the data.</p>
<p>&rt;allowing spread to others who touch the same surfaces and then touch their noses/faces.</p>
<p>Isn't a thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4">In fact, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clarified its guidance about surface transmission in May, stating that this route is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads”. It now states that transmission through surfaces is “not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads”.</a></p>
<p>Surface transmission hasn't been an issue.</p>
<p>&rt;Please read your sources</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>&rt;before you draw incorrect conclusions</p>
<p>The only incorrect conclusion is that masks work.</p>
<p>Masks do not work, the idea that you can somehow get the entire world trained in mask useage similar to that of nurses is idiotic. Your complete disregard for human error as well as well as seeming to forget that people have to work for a living, makes me think you're completely cut off from the normal working man's life as well, and haven't been able to actually see what effects masks and lockdowns have had on real people.</p>
<p>&rt;you have to approach the article objectively, reading completely through their methods and results to see how trustworthy the study is and what the study is saying.</p>
<p>Except when you yourself completely disregarded the information in order to focus only on the conclusions of the reaserchers who may lose their jobs if they say the wrong thing.</p>
<p>&rt;These sources suggest improvements to mask wearing protocols</p>
<p>Cannot happen.</p>
<p>&rt;They emphasize the importance of washing your hands a lot,</p>
<p>Which doesn't matter. Surface transmission isn't a concern.</p>
<p>Your first link is meaningless.</p>
<p>&rt;wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection</p>
<p>That's saying if YOU wear a mask, YOU can be safe. </p>
<p>Go hard I don't give a fuck what you do. You can wear a mask if you want. My problem is with legal mandates.</p>
<p>Also people dropped that line of dialogue for months now. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoenixchildrens.org/blog/2020/12/your-mask-protects-me-my-mask-protects-you">When we wear a mask, we protect those around us.</a></p>
<p>If the idea was that masks only protect the wearer, there'd be no reason to enforce laws. </p>
<p>Your second link talks about a Facebook video. I don't watch videos and I don't go on Facebook so I don't really care.</p>
<p>Let me make this clear.</p>
<p>I don't care if masks had a 100% effectiveness rate. They're unconstitutional.</p>
<p>I don't care if this WuFlu was an actually deadly virus. Rights of the individual surpass the needs of the many. </p>
<p>You're free to stay home and never go out again. I don't care. I will not. </p>
<p>Masks don't work. Masks aren't needed in the first place. The WuFlu isn't contagious. The WuFlu isn't deadly. Not a single precaution is needed.</p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>

<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>
<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

<h2>Covid-1984: Requiem for a Scam</h2>
<p>Here’s how this multilayered racket works.</p>
<h1>1. Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test</h1>
<p>&rt;”without having virus material available” ^1  </p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” ^2</p>
<h1>2. Asymptomatic, Anyone?</h1>
<p>Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:</p>
<p>&rt;“...the <strong>probability</strong> that said result is a <strong>false positive is 97%”</strong> ^1, ^2, ^6, ^7, ^8, ^9, ^10, ^11, ^12, ^13, ^14, ^31, ^32, ^39, ^40, ^44, ^45</p>
<p>&rt;”It is <strong>spreading like fire</strong>,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, <strong>they all seem to be asymptomatic.”</strong> ^27</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms”</strong> ^28, ^29, ^30, ^31</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”NFL has 77 apparently false positive</strong> coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab” ^41</p>
<h1>3. Cash for COVID Diagnosis</h1>
<p>&rt;”They get <strong>more money</strong> if those <strong>patients</strong> are then <strong>put on ventilators.”</strong> ^3, ^4, ^5</p>
<p>&rt;”Once again the old adage — <strong>follow the money</strong> — and we saw that <strong>if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission</strong> payment through the CARES Act.” ^49</p>
<p>&rt;He added, “I don’t think there’s any questions that <strong>perverse incentives have been created.”</strong>
&rt;-Sen. Scott Jensen</p>
<h1>4. Use antibody and antigen tests prone to “cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses...</h1>
<p>Creating false positives and negatives. ^15, ^16, ^17,  ^18, ^47</p>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>all 10 of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.”</strong> ^46</p>
<h1>5. Cook the Books</h1>
<p>&rt;”...<strong>classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.”</strong> ^19, ^20, ^21, ^36, ^37, ^38</p>
<p><strong>Count Death by:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Motorcycle accident ^22</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Car accident ^23</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ladder falls ^24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suicides and murders ^25</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gunshots?</h2>
<p>&rt;”These two people had tested positive for COVID, but that’s not what killed them. <strong>The gunshot wound killed them and it’s very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID</strong> when that’s not what they died from,” said Coroner Brenda Bock.” ^43</p>
<p>&rt;”Tennessee <strong>woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19”</strong> ^26</p>
<h2>If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.</h2>
<p><strong>Dr. Genevieve Briand states:</strong></p>
<p>“If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But <strong>a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,” Briand replied.”</strong> ^33 ^34 ^35</p>
