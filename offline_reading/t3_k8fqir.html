    <strong>I really don’t know how much more I can take</strong>
    <p><p>Made an account to post this. I’m a 22 year old woman from Northern England and I really don’t know how much longer I can go on like this.</p>
<p>So late 2018 was a terrible time period for me. In a period of a few months my grandmother who I cared for very much passed away, I fell out with my friendship group I’ve had since I was in school, my brother left home to move across the country (we’d always been quite close) and my job at the time was hard work for shit pay and I hated my boss. </p>
<p>Things started to look up in early 2019, but mid-late 2019 was a healing period for me. I quit my job and got a new one that I loved, I met new people and made new friends, went on one of the best holidays of my life, managed to buy a new car which I love, found new hobbies and began to travel solo which was something i’d always wanted to do. I started to take care of myself physically and was much happier as a result.</p>
<p>That’s all different now though and I feel as if I have slid back into how I used to be. I’ve barely seen anyone in these 8 months and the loneliness just gets worse and worse. My job has been a nightmare because it isn’t catered to working from home AT ALL- absolutely everything is a fight and so many of my colleagues have became snappy and standoffish. The things I used to enjoy are either closed or now unenjoyable (what’s the point in going to a pub or bar when I have to wipe everything I touch, mask up and can’t speak to anyone other than the people i’m with?)</p>
<p>Everything has really taken a toll on me too. My sleeping schedule is out of control (I could only sleep from 4am-8am last night) and I eat so much less than what I used to. I feel so alone and helpless because whenever I try and talk about my feelings I’m told to get a grip or stop being so selfish (even my parents have said both of these things). I’ll never do something stupid but at this rate I really don’t know how long I can go on. I really cannot last until Summer if that’s what people think.</p></p>

        <p>This. Can highly recommend. Hearing normal people say the things you've been thinking to yourself all year is very good for you.</p>
<p>Not to mention you'd be part of a movement that is hoping to save humanity, I think it's pretty important.</p>

        <p>At what point should selfishness stop a person from caring about their own mental health? People should really listen to their own advice and have some empathy for what you and so many others are going through right now. My friends father committed suicide during lockdown. Mental health care is more important now more then ever. Don’t let people tell you that you are being selfish.  I’m sorry you are going through, have you talked to a therapist?</p>

        <p>I try to remember that suffering and difficulty is basically the norm in life and periods of happiness and positivity are the rare exception that you must pause and enjoy. The good news is, as people we are built for struggle. You CAN survive through this and later teach the younger generations how to be tough.</p>

        <p>Good comment. Happiness is not the point of life. I’m not entirely sure what is, but happiness is definitely not. One of my most recurring lessons throughout this „pandemic” and personal life last few years, is that one of the realest struggles in life is resisting negativity. It comes at you from all angles, and most people distract themselves to ignore it. Which is why now that most distractions are gone, mental wellbeing has plummeted among the general population (not to mention, for the people who believe it, living in fear of a deadly virus). I try to remind myself that people live through wars, my own parents lived through communism, and their lives don’t end. People still fall in love, raise children, make memories. We are so adaptable. Do not give them the power to demoralize and rid you of your resolve. If we have to live through hell, let’s do it with our guns blazing...</p>

        <p>Suffering might be a norm, but this is absolutely needless and preventable suffering caused by policies. The fact that humans are deliberately doing this to other humans is what makes it so unforgivable. Its the same factor that made the holocaust a diffrent kind of tragedy.</p>

        <p>I feel you. Living in the UK is getting depressing af. It’s hard to even talk to people about it these days because everyone is so focused on what the media are feeding them that they forget what it’s like to be human and actually support those around you. </p>
<p>I personally don’t feel myself anymore. I’m losing my personality, my intellectual thoughts, my energy, my confidence. It’s actually crazy the backlash of this whole stupid thing. I see it as a transition in life, it’s one that we have to ride out for as long as possible until we find an opportunity to start living again. It’s still gloomy days but if we’re patient and stay true to ourselves something worth living/fighting for will come along.</p>

<p>Yes, this includes doing uncomfortable things, such as: not wearing a mask in shops. Going to protests. Speaking out publicly among friends or colleagues and exposing the lies. And other forms of non-compliance.</p>
<p>I feel for you. It's good to vent anonymously from time to time. But this isn't just going to "go away". We have to be ready to fight back against this, and that means doing uncomfortable things at times.</p>

        <p>Fight! Refuse to wear a mask anywhere. Go walking. Appreciate nature. If you see another person without a mask on, talk to them and try to organize a protest. Small things lead to bigger leads. Look for articles about protests in the world -- you have to search a bit, but they're out there. YOU ARE NOT ALONE!</p>

        <p>Things were really looking up for me in 2019 as well. Had a new school I was going to finish up at away from home, my mom was happy with her new boyfriend, and I had a full time job. Everything seemed to be going fucking great. Then around the end of the year, my new boss was being a fucking asshole, and I found out my mom and her boyfriend were getting into nasty fights, not physical thankfully. Then 2020 rolled in, and things just really went down the shitter. I reached my breaking point at work and quit, and was worried I'd kill myself, and my mom and boyfriend separated in the spring before the lockdowns. They just made my anxiety so much worse than before.</p>
<p>Things seem to be better now, but getting worse again. Try toughing things out. I know it isn't easy, and it certainly won't be easy by any means, but this is what they want to happen. We cannot under any circumstances let them win. Keep up the good fight.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, I really feel for you and that's why I am out protesting when I can and doing my bit to change people's minds, because even if my life has got easier in the short term through this. I know it's not the way humanity should be moving forward.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say about your coworkers changing. I have noticed this too. I come into the office everyday because it's good for me and because I consider that part of my job. Throughout this year colleagues have got completely lazy and rude and there are no repercussions. </p>
<p>People take days to answer emails and act like I'm being annoying when I am just asking them to do normal work stuff that is their job to do. Have you noticed customer service in general has gone to shit too? People will act like why the fuck are you in my shop instead of trying to help.</p>
<p>Humanity has been completely broken I tell you. I don't know how more people can't see it. I guess because they are broken.</p>

        <p>Honestly I don’t know if this is an option for you but two things: try to get outside and do some exercise (specifically hiking/outdoorsman-y stuff), and start practicing non compliance. The former has really helped me, I’m pretty much angry and frustrated all the time but I find being in the woods some version of cathartic. The latter is the only way to effect change.</p>

        <p>I’m really sorry that you’re struggling. As a 25 year old in the US I can relate quite a bit though, and you’re not alone at all, even though it may feel like it. Feel free to PM me if you want to chat and talk to a like minded person. It’s hard when most people around you treat you like a bad person just for implying we should be going back to normal.
