    <strong>Daily reminder that only an estimated 2.11% of the world population have caught Covid and only 0.04% have died from it.</strong>
    <p><p>The estimated current world population is 7,867,271,159 and an estimated 166,222,827 have caught Covid which is 2.11%</p>
<p>Also, out of that 2.11%, only 3,451,354 have 'reportedly' died from covid which is 0.04%</p>
<p>You'd think it would be higher given how bad everyone says it it.</p>
<p>Don't believe the hype.</p>

        <p>This is called ascertainment bias. </p>
<p>A lot of people never get symptoms, so they never get tested. Even if they do get tested:</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/fact-check-how-accurate-are-pcr-tests-for-the-novel-coronavirus-1.5257357<br>
False negatives, however, are more common. According to PHAC, approximately 98 per cent of patients tested within two days of their exposure will still get a negative result from PCR tests. That number drops to 50 per cent over the first five days post-exposure, and 10 per cent after that until symptoms disappear.</p>
<p>And not everyone can get tested. </p>
<p>What OP's numbers show are neither cases nor infections, it's a kind of fairytale number only used for propaganda.</p>

        <p>Nearly the entire planet has caught covid.  It spread around the planet hitting every single country and continent and nursing home in about 4 months.  </p>
<p>It hit every single nursing home around the world.</p>
<p>Care to explain how it could have done that with only 2.11% of the population having it?  Did all these people travel from nursing home to nursing home all on their own?  Don't you think someone would have noticed that?</p>
<p>So either this was a planned attack and it's not that contagious or it happened naturally and it IS that contagious.</p>
<p>They cannot both be true.</p>
<p>So the death rate is super low either way.  It's only the contagious factor that's in question.</p>

        <p>So, that's not estimated and nowhere near 3.4m people have died from covid.</p>
<p>The numbers from that site are based on PCR positive tests. And the number of deaths are "died with covid" not from. </p>
<p>The number of people infected with covid worldwide is over 25% and the number of people who died from covid alone is under 1m.</p>

        <p>You made a claim. </p>
<p>I said that your claim is wrong. You asked for the evidence and I provided it. Your claim provides misinformation. Yes, it is a mainstream site that everyone uses. The way you have presented it shows you have no idea what it means. I do. I provided you info. </p>
<p>The way you present covid makes covid appear to have a 2% death rate. This is by design. This is propaganda. You are willing spreading propaganda showing that covid is very deadly. </p>
<p>The way I present the data is the traditional way of understanding how far spread a disease has become. It shows a much lower death rate than you are presenting and shows a high level of natural immunity has already been acquired. </p>
<p>So, please check yourself.</p>

<p>I believe you are not this stupid, but intentionally trying to spread false propaganda. Otherwise, why avoid my question? The only reason is you want to provide a "daily reminder" of an artificially inflated death rate.</p>

        <p>Confirmed?  No.  But that's because no lab work is being done beyond a single PCR test which was ruled as being a completely unreliable test.  So until more reliable tests are available, no one has been confirmed to have died from covid.  Pneumonia, yes... but not covid.</p>

        <p>It’s not even 2% though. I have to get tested for work and I recently had a positive result. The protocol is 2 subsequent tests which both came back negative, thus proving it was a false positive. Guess what? That positive result already was counted in the daily case count. I know more people that have had false positives in the last year then actual real positives. Fucking scamdemic. STOP THE TESTING!!</p>

        <p>The evidence that mask mandates have worked is very weak.  Look at mask mandated states vs non mask mandated states in the USA.  There are no clear correlations that show that masks have worked.  It was a very invasive and costly experiment that does not appear to have worked.</p>
