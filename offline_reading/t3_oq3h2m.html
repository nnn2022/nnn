    <strong>My opinion was never formed by politics or the media in the first place</strong>
    <p><p>This is referring to news like (this)[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/opkhc2/biden_praises_fox_news_for_finding_the_courage_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf] and (this)[https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/op0uen/fox_news_airs_psa_telling_viewers_get_the_vaccine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf] and (this)[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/opeayy/vaccines_are_saving_lives_desantis_stresses/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf]</p>
<p>They have always claimed that the vaccine-hesitant have been brainwashed by misinformation, whether it comes from Fox News or Republican politicians (or Joe Rogan etc). They don’t understand that someone can reach their own conclusions based on their own common sense, which stems from protection because they so readily accept what their preferred media and politicians or public figures tell them. Why else would they those who get publicly vaccinated? Read the comments on posts like those. They think there is some sort of hypocrisy in rejecting vaccines that Trump or Desantis endorse; that we will need to use crazy conspiracy theories to explain why it doesn’t matter that they and Fox changed their tune, as if we are all anti-vax due to their misinformation in the first place and are acting now simply as stubborn contrarians. I was never a Fox watcher, or a Facebook user, or someone blindly loyal to any particular politician or celebrity. I came to my own conclusions without those people. I think and act according to my own beliefs, which seems to be incomprehensible to the vax-pushers.</p></p>
