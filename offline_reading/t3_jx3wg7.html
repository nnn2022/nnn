        <p>Okay, makes sense because it was a deadly disease, left permanent scarring and the vaccination at the time was effective. A vaccine isn't necessary for this disease for the vast majority of people but if it's proven to be safe and people want it good for them. There's also a big difference between requiring the military who chose to fight in the war to get vaccinated and requiring everyone to. And I wasn't even talking about vaccines more like rights like freedom to assemble.</p>

<p>Most of the military did not choose to fight in the war. They were conscripted. And the penalty for dissertation was hanging. Washington hung several soldiers for it, in fact. Maybe George Washington isn't the paradigm of freedom you think he is?</p>

        <p>My point still remains that its different to require the military to get vaccinated for a deadly disease than the whole population to get vaccinated for a mostly benign illness but vaccines weren't even my original point, I was discussing freedoms like to assemble which I stated before.</p>

        <p>Your point doesn't stand for multiple reasons, one being that the coronavirus is a deadly disease. Or do you not think that a thousand people are dying everyday from it in the US alone? Two, we don't really have the freedom of assembly. We have the freedom of assembly when the government says it's okay. Any assembly can be considered illegal at any time. Just go to any BLM protest, and you'll see that the state will just decide that they don't like the look of the situation and declare the assembly to be illegal and start arresting folks.</p>
<p>Plus, this says absolutely nothing about freedom of assembly:</p>

<p>Raw numbers mean nothing without the number of cases. The vast majority of cases are asymptomatic meaning many infections won't be detected which results in a higher CFR. The death rate is a whole other can of worms and I'm not sure how it's relevant because I was not talking about vaccination. 
&rt;Two, we don't really have the freedom of assembly. We have the freedom of assembly when the government says it's okay. Any assembly can be considered illegal at any time. Just go to any BLM protest, and you'll see that the state will just decide that they don't like the look of the situation and declare the assembly to be illegal and start arresting folks.</p>
<p>How does this prove your point? Either they are being unlawfully arrested or it's because the assembly was not lawful for other reasons, like the violence that was at many protests My argument wasnt that it was being enforced, it's that it <em>should</em> be properly enforced. </p>

        <p>My point is that all "rights" in the constitution are valid as "within reason." Any right can and will be taken away for valid and invalid reasons, that's the way the US government has always functioned.</p>
<p>Your original point was that the founding fathers knew that diseases existed and if they felt that we needed to be able to limit freedoms to deal with that disease, they would have included that in the constitution. But they did. They always understood that those rights could be limited for any reason, they just didn't picture people being so against their own self interest that they would freak out over reasonable restrictions.</p>

        <p>Then we clearly disagree fundamentally on what a reasonable restriction is. People can chose to go to a gathering if they wish to, or they can chose not to. It's not an excuse to take away the right to. But I doubt we will ever agree on that so thank you for your reply.</p>
