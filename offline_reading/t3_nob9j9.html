        <p>Well I loved the play on words when the writer said the <em>needle is moving in the right direction</em> but it’s a typical shit article from a shit profession that’s maybe one notch above prostitution. The fact that the town is largely populated by Mennonites is an extremely relevant fact that shouldn’t be buried in a casual sentence deep in the article. The writer has represented his profession well.</p>

        <p>Get ready for a flood of dishonest articles like this one from the corrupt CBC.  The goal is to put pressure on people to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Notice they didn't offer any tangible information here.  They said, "a crush of new admissions".</p>
<p>That could mean anything.  In Southern Manitoba, 10 people going to the hospital could be considered a "crush".</p>
<p>The Doctor in this article says, "I recently had two people who didn't believe they had it".  </p>
<p>So if we take those two statements together: "A crush of admissions" and "two people who had covid who didn't believe it", it could mean: A. More people are going to the hospital these days (remember, people have been discouraged from going to the hospital for over a year and a half), and B. Two people with covid doesn't mean everyone who was admitted into the hospital had covid.  </p>
<p>Also note: The province started vaccinating in what, February?  March?  </p>
<p>Shortly after, they are hit with this new "surge"?</p>
<p>Isn't it possible the "new crush of admissions" are with people who had an adverse reaction to the vaccine?  </p>
<p>But you know they would never mention that in the corrupt CBC.  </p>
<p>In any case, this article reeks of bullshit.  Just like this entire year.  Complete and utter bullshit.  </p>
<p>Be prepared to see more articles like this.  Especially this Fall.  When their insane plan of an experimental injection doesn't work, and numbers start going up, they will blame us.  Not the vaccine, they will never blame the vaccine.  They will blame us.</p>
<p>This is the goal of articles like these.  It is social engineering.  It is pushing a public health narrative.  It is propaganda.</p>

        <p>Take for example this paragraph:</p>
<p>&rt;Southern Health has the lowest vaccine uptake rates by region in Manitoba. Just over 40 per cent of people there have received at least one dose, which is about 15 to 20 per cent lower than any of the other four regions. </p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>So they started vaccinating, and cases and hospital admissions started going up.</p>
<p>But instead of making this correlation, they claim the reason is people <em>not</em> getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>All yeah people haven't been vaccinated, and they didn't have a surge like this.</p>
<p>The "crush of admissions" only started <em>after</em> they started vaccinating.</p>
