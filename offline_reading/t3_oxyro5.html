    <strong>Fully Vaccinated EmployeeTests Positive</strong>
    <p><p>One of my wife's, she's a manager at a health care practice, employees tested positive for Covid today on an antigen test. She is fully vaccinated and they mandate masks at her job but not the shots. Wife is not vaxxed but isn't sick. Just thought I'd share since there's this narrative in the MSM of how masks and vaccines work. The mask may have protected my wife from getting it, who knows, although she says she did have contact with her maskless as well.</p>

        <p>I was stuck in the house with my kid for ten days after he tested positive. He felt unwell for two whole days. No masks. No social distancing. No sanitizing. No putting the pets away LOL. I'm 40 but fit and healthy. I didn't catch it. Neither did his Dad or stepMom who had him the few days before and the day he came down with the headache. It's all bullshit.</p>

        <p>Now that l think about it l had a headache for like 3 days back in March 2021. Very unusual for me as l only have headaches when l'm very tired usually and it wasn't the case this time. </p>
<p>l brushed it off as a headcold because l have an outdoor job and the cold got to me a bit the day prior. But maybe it was the coof ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>I knew my kid would test positive because he never complains about headaches. This one was pretty bad for him to actually ask for tylenol. The only other thing wrong was a fever that would go up and down significantly throughout the day. Never higher than 101. I get both terrible headaches and fever when sick, but the fever doesn't go up and down like his did. It was bizarre. That said, I have lived a normal life for the past 18 months or so and haven't even had so much as the sniffles. I think the last time I felt good and sick was Oct 2018. I work in an office of constantly sick people. Still I'm perfectly fine.</p>

        <p>Exactly. His wasn't high enough to check, and it kept going back to normal, but it was the one covid protocol I was asked to do that I did.</p>
