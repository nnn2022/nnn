        <p>That's because in the case you sneeze the virus would spread easier due to more open spaces.</p>

        <p>Cloth mask - Practically useless, 80%+ particle penetration rate, wear this only if you want to look like you are complying, or you're like me and you just don't give a fuck anymore.</p>
<p>Surgical - roughly 47% penetration rate. Better, but too bad for me to justify wearing one religiously/forcing others to wear religiously.</p>
<p>N95 - Not sure, but you breathe everything out. If you have it, N95 does nothing to help others. You definitely have a smaller chance of getting covid, just don't ever touch your face or it's useless.</p>

        <p>Now at least to me those are all trash masks except the N95, the N95 is good since it managed to cover all the loose spots where the virus could escape or enter in comparison to surgical and cotton.</p>
<p>In my case since I live in Chile we produce ALOT of copper, and it is proven that copper is an excellent metal to deal with covid because any virus in contact of copper only lasts 15 minutes till it dissapeares, so I have an N95 shaped mask with copper particles/molecules in the mask so it's really safe. </p>
<p>Would recommend to buy it.</p>

        <p>It's an actual thing, I understand you anti-masks find it hard to believe but viruses can stay for a period of time depending on the surfaces they are in, for example, in surfaces like plastic and steel the virus can live up to 72 hours, making it so anyone that touched it can get the virus attached to him, while in copper or zinc the virus can be completely non existent after 4 hours.</p>
<p>Now this is known by the scientific community of Chile so since then in Chile it's being produced masks with copper nano-filaments, particles of copper and etc.</p>
<p>You can laugh and insult as much as you want but this is for real, the government of Chile recommends it and I trust them while you citizens of the US won't obey your government just by different political ideas which is ridiculous, you've got to the point where you just choose your political parties by favoritism without even checking their proposals or background, just "Oh he's republican, I should vote for him!".</p>
<p>I wish you understand what I say and just wear better masks for the sake of your safety and not end up like some of my family members which unfortunately got covid and didn't make it, just step aside your political ideas or laziness and protect yourself.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the copper stuff is known and has been known for a long time, not sure how copper-infused PPE is a laughable statement. I don't even wear masks, I'm "anti-mask" and anti-stupid, but even I agree with you.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that you're even right about our politics... It's so fucking partisan now it's not even funny.</p>
<p>As for the mandates, a lot of us oppose them because they're ridiculous here. We're talking the Land of the Free became the Land of Absolute Conformism in a week. I get the mandates are to help, but I think they're overboard and have lasted too long. The Supreme Court of Michigan even told our governor to stop, and she circumvented them as well, so I think you can see why we don't listen to her.</p>
<p>Anyways I won't bore you with foreign politics, just stay safe however you see fit, but remember to have humanity towards others. Someone doesn't think they need to wear a mask, don't force them. Too many deaths have occurred here because people went too far in enforcing mask mandates.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying copper doesn't kill viruses. I'm saying unless your mask is made out of copper foil, the vast majority of the virus aerosol is still going through holes in the mask or around the sides. Does some tiny, insignificant fraction land on the copper fibers and become neutralized? Sure, maybe. But practically, weaving copper into a mask or even putting copper particles into the mask isn't going to do anything to viruses small enough to go around the copper.</p>
<p>When people talk about copper killing viruses, they mean <em>viruses that land on a copper surface</em>, not just putting copper somewhere in the vicinity of the virus.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the recommendation, but I won't be buying any masks soon. I already had The Rona, and I've got the antibodies.</p>
<p>And yes, copper (from what I know and have heard) is a great natural disinfectant metal! Not much can survive on that, or many other metals for that matter, though I could be mistaken.</p>
<p>I'm not so sure about anything with copper particulates in it. I've heard there is the off chance of you breathing the particles in and getting sick as well. Just be careful and do what you need to do, and keep sane friend.</p>

No one NEEDS pants, we all have the same stuff anyway. Pants are a government control device so you know who blindly listens to the government. God damn doomers won't let you into restaurants if you don't have pants on. What is this world coming to?</p>

        <p>If you actually care about changing the situation, not doing business with companies that require masks is a good start. Giving them money so you can harass their employees is worthless, unless you need to “virtue signal” your defiance, or whatever the fuck your ppl call it.</p>

        <p>You don’t have a chip on your shoulder, but you will throw money at people for making a simple request which they are required to do. Right.</p>
<p>I’ve worked in corporate retail management in the past. I refused to do this, but a lot of managers would try to run up write ups on people so if they wanted to get rid of someone quickly they could pull out past write ups to fire someone “with cause”. By being an asshat, you are putting them in a position where they can either get written up for not asking you to wear a mask, or possibly get a write up if you cause a scene, which it sounds like you do. </p>
<p>I manage a mom and pop now, and as I explained to someone a few months ago, no you can’t just throw money on the ground and walk out. The business has not agreed to the transaction and has the right to refuse service. The dude who did this told me to pick his money up for him, so I told him if he continued to act that way I was happy to clock out and discuss it man to man instead of client to employee. What do you know he decided to drop it! Being an asshole to people who can’t fully stand up for theme selves without risking their jobs is extremely trashy and cowardly. Order your shit online and have it delivered if you don’t want to wear a mask. But we both know it’s not about that, it’s about having something to feel like a victim about.</p>

        <p>Then what’s the issue? The way your worded your initial response did not back you saying you agreed with me. I’m not interested in what you make a year dude... the topic at hand was lost in your reply. 80k is pretty good man so good on you. I did retail until I got into the trade industry 10 yrs ago. The service industry as a whole is a fuckin joke, and people treating these kids as heroes is just as much of a joke. They’re minimum wage bums putting in minimal effort. Kids making 8 bucks an hour backing companies getting fat off them is the real topic.</p>

        <p>My point was entirely that I used the “service” industry as a stepping stone in my life? And that anyone can do it if they have a good attitude and use it to learn how to work. But instead they complain about not making enough while giving subpar service and general look disheveled and pissed off.</p>
<p>That’s what I was saying to the person I replied to lol. </p>
<p>And I told you what I made because in general people have this stupid idea that service industry is a synonym for minimum wage job. I don’t defend 30 year old adults working at McDonald’s their entire life. That’s fucking stupid. But some “service” jobs payout real well. Which furthers my point about people being able to move up in life.</p>

        <p>Same. It makes me happy to see maskless people. Just had our second maskless person (couple actually)  in four months at my place of employment. They did a cute little “oooops!!! Silly me! Forgot my mask!” And made like they were going back to the car to see what I’d say. I told them I didn’t care and invited them back. They were relieved. I was happy. We had a good time.</p>

        <p>I can sorta sense the precarity building up on the mask shit, like people are fed up with this BS but no one's brave enough to acknowledge the elephant in the room.  </p>
<p>For instance my church is cracking. A month ago everyone was masked up the entire service, but as of last week people have only worn the masks as a formality, e.g. wearing them upon entry but immediately taking them off when seated. Just today there were a handful of people who left them off even after service.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately the church is probably an unreliable metric, because it's a more mask-skeptical crowd. But it's a step in the right direction, I think.</p>

        <p>That was my strategy too! I’ve now graduated to just telling everyone I have an exemption if they do ask, but at least by not putting it on preemptively, we’re reinforcing that it’s not normal.</p>

        <p>I was in Walmart yesterday and someone had there mask down. When they turn around and saw me walking in their direction they shot up and quickly pulled there mask back up. I said "It's okay, I don't care if your mask is off." and he said "I don't want to get sick" like what??? Mind you that there where other people near us also, and he was talking to someone.</p>

        <p>Shit, I was asked to leave a Meijers store in Michigan because I refused to wear a mask. </p>
<p>My wife and I went into the Meijers store in Adrian, MI., when the store manager approached me after being in the store for about 10 minutes and he said to me "can I ask why you're not wearing a mask" and I firmly told him that I didn't believe in the covid bullshit and he said "I'm going to ask you to leave my store" I said fine and left the contents in my cart right where it was at. </p>

        <p>Oh I get that and I guess it would depend on state and certain cities. But I do think that a lot of places now since this shit has been going for over a year now are getting to the point that they don't care as I've gone into stores that the state still had mask mandates in place without wearing a mask and nobody says a word to me.</p>

        <p>Required by my job to “wear a mask”. I never do and no one says shit lol. Sometimes if a client asks me to have one on I’ll put it on my chin. Full mouth and nose. And some reason that doesn’t bother anyone. Shows how dumb this shit is.</p>

        <p>Yep, that’s how you know they won’t care! I do it with all stores, but still, that’s my sign that I won’t have any trouble. The best feeling is when you come in without one, and the employee takes theirs off after seeing you. I’ve even been thanked before for not subjecting them to it!</p>
