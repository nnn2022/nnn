    <strong>Government vs Love. (Govt wins) :(</strong>
    <p><p>I enjoyed this interview a lot. She articulated a particular point in the interview in a way that I had not heard - or even sufficiently managed for myself. She said that putting people under house arrest (lockdown) when they are asymptomatic and healthy, had removed our right to be healthy according to our own sovereign judgement. That has now been replaced and superseded by Government power - as we have consented to it. Now that we have consented to that - of course it means that we have given away our liberty in a sense permanently - or until we have some form of constitutional protection in place, to specifically prevent such happening again. As things stand - now that we have given up our right to be healthy according to our own sense and experience of ourselves - we are all in a very vulnerable position and we can be arrested again at any time as healthy people and informed that we as healthy people, must stay at home because we are presenting mortal hazard to each other. In a very real sense Love has been denied. Humanity has consented to Government as being a superior entity to their own loving hearts. This is the essence of the use of the concept of asymptomatic transmission in the atrocity we have consented to. </p>
