<title>If masks work, why can't people say goodbye to their loved ones in hospitals? If masks don't work, why are we pushing a mandate that is exposing the most vulnerable because we are giving off the pretense that masks work? Both situations are cruel and inhumane.</title>

        <p>You can't fathom this kind of thinking because it makes no sense...intentionally.  All this erratic messaging is to keep people confused and fearful, which are the two main components to mind control.  If you research cult programming you will see the distinct parallels.</p>

        <p>Mask zealots will argue that the mask only reduces the chances of transmission, rather than stopping it altogether, so it's still too risky. I hate this argument because it's very hard to counter. Isolating the old and dying from their families is indescribably cruel.</p>

        <p>I was saying this months ago to my parents; if either of them or a grandparent was dying in hospital the staff wouldn't be able to stop me seeing them and I'd leave when I wanted. It's inhuman to stop people seeing family when they are dying, the holding of the hand is so important, ask any care worker who actually cares.</p>

<p>Talk about your wishes with your family, and their wishes. Not only about covid. All families are being kept apart right now once entering care.</p>
<p>I will not go to a hospital for any reason right now. My significant other know that and feels the same. If something terrible happens, I want to be around the ones I love. </p>

<p>I wonât wear a mask, I havenât worn a mask. Iâm not sick. I havenât been sick. But my city has gone into new restrictions. Therefore Iâm the problem. Iâm the reason the numbers are increasing. No. I refuse to shoulder that.</p>

        <p>My grandpa passed away around the same time (also non COVID related). They told us 2 people would be allowed to see him... any idea how fucked up it is listening to your grandma, dad and aunt try to figure out which of them get to see him before he died? We were lucky, ended up taking him home for his last week of life and we all got to see/hang out with him. Truly feel horrible for those who aren't as lucky.</p>

        <p>If you seperate the situation from the question "Do masks work" you can have a logical discussion on the topic. By adding a situation in which anyone who wants to give an answer to the question will be deemed cruel or "inhumane" you effectively reject the possibility of discussion on either side of the argument.  </p>
<p>You asked a question as if you wanted to open discourse on a subject that hits home for a lot of people, but really only made a statement of your beliefs and how anything different is "inhumane". </p>
<p>I'll answer the question anyway, bc well why not at this point. Masks are not an invisible shield that protects the wearer from all exposure and exposing others in its entirety. It acts to reduce exposure to the wearer and exposure towards others. Anyone who acts as if a mask is an absolute protection is gravely mistaken and needs to reevaluate their situation as well as their knowledge on the subject.  </p>
<p>I understand for some they value other things over their chances of catching COVID19. I am not against people having the right to choose for themselves what they feel is more important to them when it comes to their body. I also understand that this is beyond individuals needs.  </p>

        <p>The same reason people are acting like there is no point to wearing them, because they believe something different.  </p>
<p>What would be best is for there to be a proper lockdown. Perhaps America is too entitled to do such a thing. Which is why this is hitting America so hard. So without the ability to properly lock down the best that can be done is for people to do their best to be as safe as they can be during situations where there could be exposure.  </p>
<p>It isn't the high risk that are spreading it. They just are affected harder from it. That doesn't mean covid can't effect all ages and all people no matter their location or status or beliefs. Yes there are statistics that show there are lower risks, but there is still a risk.  </p>
<p>The people who would still be in quarantine would never be able to get out of quarantine if we did your suggestion. People have to adapt in order to lower the numbers enough that it is safe enough to be out because there is less chance of being exposed. If there are only like 10 people in the whole state who have it and their potential exposures and people they could have exposed all are put into quarantine right away this could be managed. We just need to get those numbers low and prioritize the response.</p>

        <p>I agree life is risk, and I am fortunate to be living in a time where so many of our average day risks are so well studied and documented with years and years of knowledge easily accessible to so many people. The issue is that this risk is unlike the ones we are used to. Not because of what it is or how deadly it is, but because it is not well studied. We don't have the wealth of knowledge we are so accustomed to having. We fear what we don't know and that is a way of protecting ourselves. We have evolved (well most of us hopefully) to move beyond that fear and to develop a need to understand the unknown so we can provide ourselves the ability to safeguard ourselves from danger.  </p>
<p>For someone to see something new and watch it kill people and say "I don't fear this" is not courage, it is denial and it is foolish. Knowledge is power. Denial comes from fear. I am not saying not to deny people when they are wrong, but don't deny that people dying from something so suddenly new in the world is frightening.</p>

<p>The death rate for non obese people is parable or lower than the average flu death statistic.</p>
<p>Because of life choices means others have to accommodate?</p>

        <p>Where is this study you are talking about that claims that this is mostly just affecting obese people? This isn't a obese people virus. It is an everyone virus. They claim children have less chance of catching it but that is just now being studied and those claims aren't even per reviewed yet last I checked.  </p>
<p>I really would like to know where you got your information, if I am missing something I'd like to know. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I was asking for your source. Also that doesn't claim that the majority of people who have died from COVID are obese. It says obese people are more likely to need more medical intervention and are more likely to die from COVID. 
 It also doesn't say that obese people are more likely to catch COVID or that they are the cause of more spread. So your just fat shaming. People with upper respiratory issues are more likely to need more medical attention too. The elderly are at higher risk as well. It isn't "protecting people who made poor decisions" it is protecting people in general. Yeah that means there are obese people in that group but they aren't the only group of people effected.  </p>
<p>Oh and obesity isn't caused just by poor choices. There are medical causes for obesity as well. Should they die for that? No one should be dying bc they caught COVID. Who are you? Judge jury and executioner and being fat is worthy of the death sentence?  There are lots of reasons people can be at higher risk for severe illness with covid. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-increased-risk.html </p>
<p>In you click on the links there you can see a full list, beyond just obesity and smokers. You see a slew of medical reasons that are outside of people's control. So should they get COVID and die bc a bunch of entitled Americans want to have a BBQ? America needs to just do a proper lockdown and get off their high horses.</p>

<p>Also, the point remains, if the goal is to reduce transmission, the ONLY way to prevent spread is quarantine those in high risk.

        <p>I think you may have missed the point.</p>
<p>Either:</p>
<p>You realize that mask are not as efficient that the general population thinks it is and that only high risk people should be quarantining because being truthful that they still have a 20% (average protection)  of dying is not a risk most of the people are willing to take. </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>You still think masks are more effective than they are. (studies pre2020, show that very little in terms of efficiency outside the surgery room).  Thus giving those in high risk categories a false sense of security and they go on their normal routine and are dying from the disease they should be quarantining from.</p>
<p>If you truly want to "save all the grandmas" like we were doing back in March, you keep them at home. Period. You don't quarantine the healthy. You let them build up the herd immunity (see Sweden) so that later those under quarantine can come back out. </p>
<p>Locking down everyone, and enforcing masks is actually creating a negative affect.</p>

        <p>Different masks have different effectiveness.  But even a cloth bandanna can help slow the spread.</p>
<p>What negative effect?  It has slowed the spread, and saved lives.  </p>
<p>Countries that implemented a strict lockdown are doing the best (see South Korea, New Zealand, Canada, etc ...).  You mentioned Sweden, who did a half-assed lock-down, and their death rate is really high.</p>

        <p>Then what? What is your point. Itâs fine by me if those high risk people are in a forced quarantine. Thatâs also what many people have been telling those at high risk for a long time.

        <p>It's to reduce the rate of the virus spreading. A foolproof method would be difficult for people to use en masse but a mask is very effective for how cheap and easy they are to implement. This combined with social distancing help to bring down the infection rate so less people get sick and less people die. It's a very simple thing that just about everyone can utilize</p>

        <p>False comparative.</p>
<p>There is no reason not to have brakes.  It's illogical comparison.</p>
<p>There is no trade off.</p>
<p>If masks do work, then we should be able to proceed with normal life.  But like you're suggesting, masks are now efficient. Therefore you are killing grandma's because the implication is that people in masks are safe, they are not, therefore grandma's will die because you suggest everyone do an inefficient measure.</p>

        <p>Only dumb people who deal in absolutes would think the way you do.  Itâs not a false comparative.  Thereâs literally no reason not to wear a mask.  It is scientifically proven to reduce the spread of the virus and there is no credible scientific data that shows harm to wearing a mask properly.  The majority of the public understand that the mask helps protect others.  It is not 100% effective and additional measures should be taken to avoid spreading the virus.  It seems to be this small subsection of people in this sub that canât seem to comprehend this.  The entire world is beating this virus with a lot of countries going back to normal.  We however will be stuck in this semi operation capacity because of dumbfucks like all of you</p>

<p>That right there, will kill people. Period. The way everyone defends mask act like it is. It is not...at all. So people who shouldn't be outside are.   The only scientific 100% way not to catch Covid is 100% quarantine.  If you want to not risk going outside, so be it, you have the right. But other should have their right to choose to be in society. </p>

        <p>&rt; The harshest lockdown and measures are the same places where the cases are exploding.</p>
<p>Factually untrue, and lacks causation in any case. Maybe they are locked down <em>now</em> because the cases kept increasing. </p>
<p>What is statistically evident is that cases, hospitalization, and deaths have increased in all places that have ended lockdown orders early.</p>
<p>&rt; What you can't seem to comprehend is the idea that the countries that did the best, didn't change much.</p>
<p>You're probably talking about the poster-child country of Sweden, right? Because that's the talking point you heard since they didn't quarantine, nor lockdown, nor mask up...</p>
<p>Sweden: 5,846 deaths. 10,230,000 population = 578 deaths per million</p>
<p>Norway (nearest neighbor): 265 deaths. 5,430,000 population = 49 deaths per million</p>
<p>United States: 190,787 deaths. 328,200,000 population = 576 deaths per million</p>
<p>Canada (nearest neighbor): 9,163 deaths. 37,590,000 population = 242 deaths per million</p>
<p>But please tell me again how Sweden is rocking it!!!</p>

<p>We will only know for sure at the end of probably 2021, but it's pretty apparent now that they are done with it, and people today are still blaming "the bad orange man" for the deaths here in the States.</p>
<p>Remember the flatten the curve era? In March, where everyone promised to stay home for a couple weeks while this thing burns itself out? Well, we never gave it a chance to run it's course. So instead of a getting it all over with like Sweden in a couple months. We're extending lockdowns and causing more deaths from the lockdowns than from Covid.</p>
<p>Genius!</p>
<p>No more deaths to covid, because we starved out a large portion of the population. </p>
<p>Causation...you speak of causation? </p>
<p>We implemented masks and lockdowns, and guess what? Not a single county in the US "Slowed" down. </p>

        <p>Just to be clear. Your position is that Sweden is free and clear now with roughly the same death rate as the U.S. by doing nothing. </p>
<p>So... Following that logic, why isn't the U.S. done with the virus tooâ½</p>
<p>Could it maybe be that after seeing the death rate skyrocket citizens in Sweden voluntarily took measures to quarantine and distance... While idiots like you in the States think it's perfectly OK to keep propagating the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>Lots of countries in EU stopped any kind of precautions including Poland, where there are currently almost zero restrictions. I know you're scared but then just stay home rather than trying to enslave entire planet.</p>

<p>Theyâre death rate is 1.8% of those TESTED. It does not account for those not tested. Their death rate is the same as California, about 1.8% of those TESTED. If you account for those not tested, then the survival rate is going to be much much higher. Remember when everyone thought the death rate was 5%?

        <p>This most vulnerable person is the person dying. So no logical reasoning there.</p>
<p>You have to wear your mask walking INTO a restaurant but as soon as your at your table, covid can't get you. So why not apply that same logic to a hospital, wear a mask into patient's room, then you can do whatever and say goodbye to grandma.</p>

<li>Virus Load matters </li>

at hospital setting, for sure there are virus and huge load. 
Elsewhere, maybe virus and smaller load </li>
</ul>
<p>Different masks have different efficiency, more or less it will block some but not all, if the surrounding virus load is relatively small and your mask blocks some, even if you still get the virus, the load is small which gives your body a chance to fight it</p>

        <p>Yeah its pretty simple. These control measures aren't magic, its just about lowering the risk for the entire population.</p>
<p>Avoid congested places, avoid areas where there is likely to be a high chance of virus carriers, distance as much as possible - 6ft as a guide, wear masks for those times where you can't avoid people such as grocery shopping. Really it beggars belief that this is not common sense for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>From the CDC:
âWhile COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups than flu. Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have more superspreading events than flu.â</p>
<p>There is a lot not being said here.  Namely the general populace is not at increased risk.  The actual studies done on this indicate that the flu is more contagious but COVID has more severe symptoms in vulnerable populations.  This results in misleading statements like the one above that is only focusing on those specific sub-populations.  In general (i.e. for the average person) the seasonal flu is more contagious.</p>

        <p>Yeah to be honest its hard to determine either way, struggling to find flu cases vs covid cases for the same period of time. It does seem like the flu is actually more contagious from my admittedly brief little foray onto Google. So fair play I'll concede that point. On the bright side, wearing masks and distancing should also help to reduce flu transmission so thats a bonus.</p>

        <p>I've seen a lot more studies that suggest that face masks are effective. I can understand why having all these sources saying masks aren't effective, all in a single place could make the argument seem compelling, however the studies you provided are outliers. The vast majority of evidence suggests that masks do help. The difference is that for kooky conspiracy theories, you get slightly obsessed individuals who go out of their way to compile as much information as possible that seemingly proves their beliefs. You get it for climate change deniers, flat earthers, anti vaxxers. They will all come at you with what they feel is indisputable evidence, but that is only because they ignore anything they dont already agree with.</p>
<p>I think we should definitely be more specific when recommending masks as certain masks with valves might not help as much as others, but I'm of the view that any mask is better than no mask to be honest.</p>

        <p>There are studies that say masks cause other issues. The blanket mandate we have now, since it doesn't enforce the types of masks, is completely worthless. There is no need for a mandate and requirement of ineffective masks. That's theater. Individuals are welcome to wear their own perfectly fitted N95s and carry on. The current situation isn't helping anything and potentially hurting some.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your nice response :)</p>
<p>Itâs easy (dare I say normal) to blindly react to things that donât align with our worldview (this applies fairly equally to all humans).  But, the âtruthâ is pretty much always somewhere in the middle.  And the answer is always complicated.  </p>
<p>Yes, masks can reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses in specific settings and situations but at the same time they also make no difference (or actually cause harm) in many others (this is why a lot of these studies âcontradictâ each other).  </p>
<p>More than a few studies confirm that putting the equivalent of a dirty washcloth on your face for extended periods is detrimental to your overall health.  None of the research suggests this is a good idea for the average person to do in their daily life.  Masks might (emphasis on might, other factors are far more crucial) be useful in situations where interpersonal contact is limited to fifteen minutes or less (then you really should throw the mask away).  And after fifteen minutes it doesnât matter, you and that other person are sharing air.  </p>
<p>For the average person, wearing a face mask is like shutting the front door on a house with no walls.  But itâs okay, because we (on average, in general) have immune systems designed to deal with that sort of thing.</p>

        <p>The thing is you have to take it as more as a percentage not as a full proof. Hereâs the analogy that I will use so if somebody wears a condom  And birth control issues there still is a chance that a child can be conceived this would be the same way as using a mask it is lessening your chances of getting Covid but itâs not 100% full proof maybe more like 90 and the thing is a mask is really to protect the people around you And give you somewhat of a barrierRemember that even the nurses were mask at the beginning overtime some of them did get Covid again proving that masks are not 100% full proof but it does lessen your chances of getting it I think thatâs the problem that most people have with this is that they think itâs a all solution or not really you need to think of it as a percentage and chances I know this sounds redundant</p>

<p>Also, Masks are not as efficient as media likes to point out, even the pinging left website snopes admits that masks are not as effective as we are leading people to think, therefore, putting those at risk in higher chances of catching the disease.</p>

<p>This is 100% a narcissistic view. It's not just about your own survival risk. You in turn might give it to 3 people who in turn each give it to 3 more people all. You become a disease vector. So ask your dying grandma how many people she's OK with getting killed just to say goodbye to you.</p>

<p>Masks help, but they aren't a 100% guarantee, as nearly all studies have shown. It's not "unclear" as many misinformers say. I absolutely feel your pain about this situation but we have to remember, this is a once in a ~~lifetime~~ century pandemic from a brand new disease. Our normal expectations are out the window.</p>

<p><a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/coronavirus/resources/covid-19-faqs-for-health-professionals.html">Here is some real science for you:</a></p>
<p>&rt; A recent summary of the latest data by the CDC shows that about two-thirds of the COVID-19 transmissions in the U.S. come from people not showing symptoms â either because their cases are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. According to the CDC, this âunderscores the importance of social distancing, including the avoidance of congregate settings, to reduce COVID-19 spread.â</p>

<p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions">WHO</a></p>
<p>&rt; Early data from China suggested that people without symptoms could infect others.</p>
<p>&rt; The <strong>extent</strong> of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown. </p>
<p>&rt; Transmission from infected people without symptoms is difficult to study.</p>
<p>That is a far cry from "If you have no symptoms you cannot spread it." and specifically looking at asymptomatic and not pre-symptomatic, which they state:</p>
<p>&rt; Multiple studies have shown that people infect others <strong>before they themselves became ill</strong>, (10, 42, 69, 82, 83)</p>
<p>Here is what the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html">CDC</a> has to say:</p>
<p>&rt; Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic). ^16,18,20-30</p>
<p>&rt; One study found that as many as <strong>13%</strong> of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 <strong>infection in children were asymptomatic.</strong> ^16 </p>
<p>&rt; Another study of skilled nursing facility residents who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 after contact with a healthcare worker with COVID-19 demonstrated that <strong>half of the residents were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the time of contact tracing, evaluation, and testing</strong>. ^27 Patients may have abnormalities on chest imaging before the onset of symptoms.21,22</p>

<p>There is 0 research that states that asymptomatic spread is impossible.</p>

<p>For all real purposes asymptomatic vs. pre-symptomatic doesn't matter if someone who is "non-symptomatic" can spread the disease (which has been proven).</p>

<p>Look, let's move past the veneer of you caring about facts and let's just be honest. What do you stand to gain from society being completely shut down, the economy collapsing, and civil order collapsing into civil war?

they are only to protect the person that wears it, and it need to be the proper mack to filter the specific contaminate.

        <p>sir or madam, i understand you frustration .
i am not pro mask in the least , i said - and read it slowly . "masks work for their intended purpose". - meaning , if you are sanding drywall you would want an N95 mask.
if you are working in a paint booth, you'll want a full face mask with filter cartridges.</p>
<p>now i understand you can't see the difference in what i'm saying, you think i'm a pro-mask doomer, and this is what makes you look stupid.
i never said anyone should be wearing a mask as we are currently being forced.
masks DO WORK, when the appropriate mask is work for the appropriate purpose. - what i said has FKall to do with the scamdemic .
you are why people see us as crazy.</p>

But what we <em>will</em> hold against you is your odious and unacceptable behavior toward the few people in the world who had the courage to call out the rest of the species on this insane bullshit, if you choose to continue. </p>
<p>It's up to you, man. Only you can make yourself be an adult.</p>

        <p>So masks don't work then. I don't understand why you said they do, since we're talking about the masks people wear in public and their effectiveness with regards to the WuFlu.</p>

        <p>what i said was the proper mask works for it's intended purpose.</p>
<p>AS IN a welder would not use a bee-keepers mask - get it.</p>
<p>there isn't a mask i can wear that does FK-all for you. </p>
<p>Masks of all types are PPE (except Halloween masks)</p>
<p>forcing people to wear a "face covering" of any type is overreach.</p>
<p>and the people who are mindlessly  following are part of the problem.</p>
<p>i like how these pro-mask cunts want to incorrectly tell you to "follow the science"</p>
<p>and then throw their masks and gloves on the ground wherever they are.</p>
<p>is there any science around litter and pollution ?</p>

        <p>It seemed fairly well implied that the masks in question were the masks used by the public and not any other kind of mask. Seems I made a false assumption, and I'm sorry for that, but it wasn't clear.</p>
