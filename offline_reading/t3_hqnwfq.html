    <strong>Sweden's high infection rate is not due to their lack of a lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>Just because Sweden didn't lock down, doesn't mean that their people have been going outside this whole time. Swedes were obviously too scared to go outside throughout all of April and May, so the herd immunity didn't start until the beginning of June. Then, the herd immunity successfully ended this month, and of course, the media is completely silent about it.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">Sweden's daily cases</a>, what I'm saying makes a lot more sense.</p>
<p>Even though we still don't know enough about the virus to draw any conclusions, we never tried not socially distancing, and these "experts" have been portraying the effectiveness of social distancing as factual.</p></p>
