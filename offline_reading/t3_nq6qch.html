    <strong>Simple Question You Can Ask Doomers...</strong>
    <p><p>I have family members that are pressuring me and my wife to be a part of the human trials of one of these gene therapy injections.  Having had this argument with them several times, I have been able to come up with a simple, easy to understand question to ask them that I have yet to hear a rational explanation to:</p>
<p>&rt; Why would anyone willingly accept an untested experimental gene therapy injection that doesn't stop you from catching or spreading a virus that is less likely to kill you than the seasonal flu?</p>
<p>There's no tinfoil hat conspiracy aspects to this, there's no reference to sterilizations or prion disease or anything else that might lead people to dismiss you as a conspiracy theorist (though I think those are serious issues that may appear with "the jab").  It's just a simple question that they can't answer without getting angry and arguing basically that we need to do it to do our part and make everyone else more comfortable.  </p>
<p>So in this thread, let's post other simple ways to stump the Doomers.  What's the best single sentence (or close to that) you have that makes their heads explode?</p></p>

        <p>I've used a similar one.  I have told people: </p>
<p>&rt; There has never been an mRNA gene therapy ever approved for use in humans anywhere in the world ever because in the trials, they all either didn't work, worked but had horrible side effects, or killed many or all of the animal test subjects.  </p>
<p>Watching people try to rationalize that one away is always fun.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt honestly understand the science behind this stuff. I wish I did. I try. But the thing that keeps me hesitant is simply this: Why would anyone believe the people who have been wrong about absolutely everything this whole time are are all of a sudden perfectly right about what to shoot into my my blood?‚Äù</p>

        <p>I agree.  I really don't know how people still believe most of what the media says anymore.  They have been insufferable for a long time, but ever since probably 2015 they have been so wrong so many times I'm shocked people still give them any credibility</p>

        <p>I generally am not going out of my way to get into these discussions.  They come up.  For example, the other day, my wife had to shut her mom down because she was trying to guilt my wife into getting "the jab" by saying something to the effect of "we just don't want your daughter to grow up without a mother."  My wife had to tell her she wasn't taking the shot at borderline yelling level to get her mother to stop.  </p>
<p>I know I'm not alone in experiencing instances like this, so when they come up, I have found it's better to put them on the defensive and make them justify their position than to have to defend my decision not to get it.  By asking them the simple question I posted in the OP, they have to reconcile that information with what they hear.  I have found it works better than arguing and sometimes it's even better than just disengaging.</p>

        <p>One major retort I have come across when telling people I'm not going to be a part of the human trial is this: </p>
<p>&rt; You should get vaccinated because you don't know what the long term effects of COVID are!</p>
<p>My response is obvious: </p>
<p>&rt; We also don't know what the long term effects of the mRNA gene therapy are, but I'll take my chances with a virus that causes a cold.</p>

        <p>From a comment I posted.</p>
<p>Do you really believe we eradicated the seasonal flu this year?  Do you really believe that?  You know that cases were supposedly down almost 100% country wide correct?  Ask yourself how that's possible.  If your answer is masks and social distancing I don't know what to tell you.  </p>
<p>Let's say you believe that - that masks and social distancing eradicated the flu.  Are you willing to live your life the way that you have for the last year in order to save people from dying of the flu this fall?  Is any amount of death acceptable in a society?  If you aren't willing to live your life like you have for the last year and a half for the rest of your life -then you better start asking yourself the hard questions like "what amount of preventable death is acceptable in a society?"  Because I have news for you, you can't eliminate the seasonal flu with a vaccine; by their own admission the flu vaccine is at MOST 40% effective on a good year.  This means that in order to save all those lives that you think we saved this year, masking and social distancing and distance working and learning will have to be a permanent fixture in your life.  Are you willing to accept that?</p>
<p>I'm not being argumentative at this point but I'd like you to think about that.  I'd like to hear your thoughts.</p>

        <p>This exact thing came up with my family.  My father-in-law was explaining how amazing it was that the flu was non-existent in 2020 because of all the COVID restrictions.  My brother-in-law replied something along the lines of "well that's if you believe they didn't just label all the flu deaths 'COVID'." And then we were off to the races again.  My wife and I, along with our daughter, will not be getting the COVID "vaccine", no matter what.  My brother-in-law didn;t want to but ended up getting it anyways because his wife has health problems.  </p>
<p>Anyways, unfortunately I have seen so much cognitive dissonance on this point.  On the one hand these people complain that the reason COVID is still running wild and more than half a million deaths have occurred because selfish assholes won't wear masks and socially distance, but then turn right around and proclaim that we eradicated the flu because we were al wearing masks and socially distancing.  It's hard to believe that otherwise intelligent people have fallen for these propaganda points so completely.</p>
