        <p>Did you even read this before sending it?? It literally says “Though it’s not known whether the masks played a role in either death”. The first boy died to Cardiac arrest which means he had health problems before this. The second one isn’t clear on how he died. This is a very sad incident and I hope happens to no one else. But you are just being a complete idiot. You cant blame the mask when there is no clear evidence that mask caused it.</p>

        <p>Right right. You fools love to quote tobacco science stating masks prevent viral infection ( which is complete bs) but there is no way covering the only source of oxygen(you know, what’s required to live) could cause serious issues, like death. Gtfoh. Not to mention the massive influx of bacterial pneumonia cases due to strapping on a filthy piece of cloth to your life giving breathing orifice.</p>

        <p>Did you bother reading the links?</p>
<p>study 1: "This early change in SpO2 may be either due to the facial mask or the operational stress. Since a very small decrease in saturation at this level."</p>
<p>Not only do they not know why the change in SpO2 is happening, it is minute. I guarantee you if I played Chess for 5 hours straight while standing up, <em>without a mask</em> you would see a drop in SpO2 as well. Have you ever been concentrating exceptionally hard on something and noticed you are breathing less? </p>
<p>Have you ever heard the saying, "remember to breath," in regards to being stressed? There's a reason that it is a saying.</p>
<p>Study 2, and all studies on surgeons and masks:</p>
<p>Let me explain to you how gravity works in simple terms. Things go down, towards the planet. A surgeon working over a body is going to get some amount of particles from their breathing and talking onto the patient. We have known this since 1897. However, we cover surgical sites with anti-bacterials for a reason. </p>
<p>You can't compare wearing a mask during surgery to prevent infection to wearing a mask to prevent the spread of virus for multiple reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, as I already mentioned, we already know that bacteria can get into the surgical site regardless of masks, and there are dozens of ways that infection is prevented during a surgery because we already know that bacteria can get into a surgical site. It's a very common surgical complication. </p>
<p>The purpose of a mask is not <em>just</em> to stop all of the droplets in your breath. It also <em>slows down</em> the droplets, as seen in this simple study.</p>
<p>https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/511513-study-shows-most-homemade-mask-help-slow-droplets</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeEBn4ttZZY</p>
<p>There is a reason why masks aren't the <em>only</em> thing recommended to slow the spread of Covid-19. That's why social distancing is another vital step to slowing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2007800</p>
<p>and before you say point out, </p>
<p>"We did not assess the relative roles of droplets generated during speech, droplet nuclei,2 and aerosols in the transmission of viruses. Our aim was to provide visual evidence of speech-generated droplets and to qualitatively describe the effect of a damp cloth cover over the mouth to curb the emission of droplets"</p>
<p>That simply means that masks would be ineffective against "airborne" viruses such as the measles, TB, or smallpox. </p>
<p>When someone coughs, sneezes, or talks, these droplets can infect another person if they get into their airways. Droplets typically do not travel more than six feet (about two meters) and do not linger in the air. A social distance of 6 feet intends to protect you against infecting another person or becoming infected. Still, the CDC is now recommending the use of face masks in public.</p>
<p>Masks <em>slow down</em> and sometimes stop these droplets.</p>
<p>Sure, if everybody was always inches away from everybody else and directly over them (like in the case of surgeries) then masks wouldn't work but since that is not the case, all of your surgical masks don't work arguments are null and void because they are not comparable to wearing a mask to prevent the spread of virus in a population.</p>
<p>You are comparing bad apples to oranges and saying we should throw out all of the oranges.</p>

        <p>All post covid literature. It’s also full of opinionated objective lies and No rct’s. I have 14 rct’s all showing masks have zero effectiveness for controlling vri’s. There are also many videos of doctors and osha professionals using oxygen meters correctly showing instant drop in oxygen and sharp increases in o2. Of course in short term your blood oxygen may not drop much but people are wearing these things for hours and months now.  They serve no purpose other than people in power getting their foot into the door of controlling more of your day to day life. Wake up Chief</p>

        <p>No, the likelihood you’ll be fine is very high.  Having case reports and saying it’s possible is accurate.  Making a post about one person and implying that lung damage cannot happen is false.  Big difference.</p>

        <p>Your reasoning is objectively incorrect, though. "It <em>can</em> happen" is a statement which can actually be supported by a single data point, so long as it's a positive one. "It <em>can't</em> happen" isn't a statement which can be supported by a single data point, and you know that. </p>

        <p>Smoking can also cause permanent lung damage but nobody's ever cared about that. Drug use may cause long-term damage but the millennial doomers hiding inside from the coof are happy enough to take the risk of lighting up a joint.

        <p>A doomer is a person who thinks coronavirus is lurking around every corner and the only way to live from now on is by hiding under your bed. </p>
<p>If you absolutely MUST leave from under said bed, doomers state that face diapers, hazmat suits and hand sanitizer must be on your person at all times or face $2000 fine or imprisonment. </p>
<p>Doomers also recommend getting all of your coronavirus information from morning television, celebrities and Bill Gates.</p>
