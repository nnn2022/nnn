    <strong>The vaccinated wearing masks to delay the effects of spike proteins?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just thinking out loud with this one. Buuuuuut, do you think it could be possible that the vaxed are being told to wear masks because of these spike proteins that could potentially effect every person they encounter. I dunno if I believe in spike proteins yet but, if I was an evil overlord (lol) and my vaccines effected vaxed and non-vaxed people. Then I would want the most bang for my buck. I would make everyone continue to wear masks until enough people had been vaccinated to trigger enough damage to the masses. The people who were unvaxed wouldn't stand a chance because they would be constantly surrounded by people shedding these spike proteins. If they can make women miscarry (as well are other things I have heard), then things would be pretty bad. </p>
<p>Obviously they wouldn't want everything hitting the fan early. It would breed skepticism about the safety of the vaccine before they had hit their targets. </p>
<p>Does this sound plausible or mental? Lololol</p></p>

        <p>The only problem with this post is it assumes masks work. If they can't stop transmission of intact viral particles they certainly won't stop individual proteins from it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm always cautious of what I take seriously. Not sure where I stand on spike proteins right now but it would make an ideal bioweapon. </p>
<p>Even my period is different since being around people who are vaccinated. I won't let that further isolate me, but it does make me question things right now.</p>

        <p>Not sure where I seen it, wish I saved it but the countries in the Southern Hemisphere specifically around the Pacific Ocean could already have antigens/antibodies (unsure of which) because we’re in a warmer hemisphere and have had (coronavirus) common cold. </p>
<p>A lot of us could already have natural defence against Covid so I like to think humans already have some sort of defence. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/general-information.html</p>

        <p>Seems mental based on my (admittedly insignificant) anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>My barber is vaccinated, and I've had my hair cut by him several times since then. Never been an issue. He wears a mask while cutting my hair because the state requires it, but never does when I go to pay. He also never wears a mask when I do IT work for him.</p>
<p>But then again I'm possibly immune. Think I had it back in early March of last year. Not sure because I never took a test, but first time I've been legit sick in probably 15 years. Even at that, it was just 3 days of feeling like crap and then I was back to normal.</p>

        <p>I think for the most part women have been claiming to have been affected due to their menstrual cycle either being late, skipped, or painful/ extremely heavy compared with normal periods they typically experience. </p>
<p>I myself have had issues this month and am usually like clockwork. But have been around vaxed people. </p>
<p>I could be reaching here. And I'm not 100% sure of it. Obviously time will tell. But quite possibly men are either unaffected or affected differently in more subtle ways.</p>

        <p>Joe Biden posted that now fully vaccinated people can go outside without masks, which is stupidity as the vaccine (theorically) doesn't make you immune to it and you can get it / spread it. </p>
<p>Why are they pushing vaccinated people to stop wearing masks then? Makes you think about it. I wonder if we actually need to wear masks outside for real now.</p>

        <p>I'm in the UK and wearing masks outdoors isn't a requirement. We wear them in shops only. </p>
<p>If they told me I have to wear a mask outdoors I would still not wear it and resist. Who the fuck do they think they are, seriously? </p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, those who are terrified can stay in doors and self isolate. Let everyone else get back to normal.</p>

        <p>Even if it was possible for a vaccinated person to transmit 'spike proteins' (which it's not, these would only be systemic), a spike protein on its own is not infectious or active. The reason recently vaccinated persons are encouraged to keep wearing a mask is that they could still transmit or catch covid whilst establishing immunity</p>

        <p>Looking around at proNN discussions, there might be evidence for the scenario of the waxed infecting ppl around them already.  We just wanted to keep the fearmongering to a minimum here, be forewarned if you stray into other forums. Seem to be organic reports too (in some places; can't be sure on reddit/twittr ofc). Those we see coming here with reactions and regrets are some sign thät word is finally spreading from the initial conferences by concerned MDs/scientists to the public at large.</p>
<p>And what are we to say to such people, that the considerate thing is for them to stay masked up?</p>

        <p>No. It’s just very difficult to enforce who’s been vaccinated and who’s not. Also, vaccines are highly effective just not 100% effective. Especially in the first few weeks. Better safe than sorry. The masks will eventually come off though, like in Israel.</p>

        <p>Effective? </p>
<p>My immune system has over a 99% chance in protecting me from Covid. Vaccines are not needed for someone of my health status (even if vaccines were effective). </p>
<p>They do not prevent people from spreading the virus, nor do they prevent those that have been vaxxed from contracting the virus. All they say is they reduce the severity of the symptoms. My immune system does that all by itself, thanks very much. </p>
<p>So I have a choice. Get vaxxed with an untested vaccine (which we have no knowledge of the long term implications - admitted by the developers themselves). OR - trust my immune system and have not only a 99% recovery rate from Covid, but zero chance of vaccine side effects. </p>
<p>I think I know the smarter option. </p>
<p>"Better safe than sorry" doesn't really apply when the vaccine safety hasn't been fully proven.</p>

        <p>-The evidence is building that they actually do prevent people from spreading the virus to a great degree. There was no evidence in the begging though, because there wasn’t enough time to build that evidence.</p>
<p>-It’s not about you or your immune system. You live within a society. You need to protect society if you benefit from life within a civilised society.</p>
<p>-The effect of long term tissue damage on survivors is still unraveling.</p>
<ul>
<li>if not eradicated, then the risk of more dangerous mutations and repeat infections is a huge uncertainty. </li>
</ul>
<p>The vaccine has been tested. It’s extremely rare for any chemical to cause a harmful long term effects from one small dose exposure. Medications that cause long term side effects are usually a result of multiple small exposures over a long time. Pretty much one get a vaccine one day and then suffers as a result 5 years on. It’s not how things generally work.</p>
<p>Yes some people in the short term however will suffer side effects, that’s unfortunate and it’s a fact for all medicines, chemicals even foods like peanuts.</p>

        <p>Also, If not eradicated?</p>
<p>Vaccines cause viruses to mutate. The very nature of a virus is to mutate. It will never be fully eradicated. It's part of life now. </p>
<p>And while we are on the subject - it's better to LIVE than to hide away in fear of dying. We are all going to die. FACT. </p>
<p>Personally I'd rather make the most of the time I have than hiding away scared of a virus or terrified of the dreaded "unvaxed" lol! </p>
<p>It's stupid.</p>

        <p>I am not a nihilist. I think we as a society should strive to live as long and healthy life as possible. We should protect each other from dying alone while struggling and fighting to breathe. </p>
<p>We should avoid over running the health system and lining up hospital corridors with patients struggling to breathe! Brazil, India, northern Italy etc.. </p>
<p>And No there’s still a chance we can eradicate this virus.</p>

        <p>I do intend to be healthy. Hence I will not be taking a vaccine that I don't need. </p>
<p>I would view a McDonald's chicken nugget in the same way. I dont put poison in my body. If people wanna increase their health how about they eat healthy, and exercise for a start? Most people don't care enough about their health to do those basic things. But big pharma comes up with a new drug and they are more than happy to chow down. </p>
<p>If you respected your body and your health you would be looking to boost your immune system through the consumption of natural foods. You would encourage others to do the same. But all I see is most vaxed people rushing to get their free beer and donuts, because - don't forget - they care so much about their health. </p>
<p>Some hypocrisy is clearly being overlooked.</p>

        <p>We should do all the things you mentioned. I agree.</p>
<p>However getting vaccinated is more of a societal responsibility if you’re low risk. We benefit from being in a civilised society because most of us play by the rules of the game. If we all decide to say fuck society, I wont play by the rules of the game because there’s a small chance vaccines will harm me then we’re being hypocrites. </p>
<p>The things you mention are individual risks. Also, you’re being hyperbolic and there’s pretty much no evidence for a correlation between beint anti-vax and leading a healthier personal life. Anecdotally speaking some of the anti-vax nutters I know happen to smoke the most.</p>

        <p>People have died from the vaccine. Been left paralysed. But I suppose better safe than sorry? How is that safe? </p>
<p>Also, I lead a whole foods plant based diet with as much organic produce as I can afford. So don't bring junk food chemicals into it because I dont consume that rubbish either. </p>
<p>Fact is I am critical of all uneccessary chemicals whether they come from vaccines, skin care, cleaning products, make up, food, water, ect. I am not going to have a vaccine just because people like you believe it's the right thing to do for society. </p>
<p>You do you. And I'll do me. Don't like it? I don't give a crap. I will not participate because of government or peer pressure. I have morals and values that I hold in high regard. I will not change my life. Risk my health or immune response to appease anyone. I'd rather die. So you better hope people like me drop dead from the dreaded RONA, because we aren't going anywhere. And we will resist the vaccine at all costs.</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>
