<p>Cats and dogs may need COVID vaccine one day</p>
<p>Domestic animals such as cats and dogs may one day need vaccinating against COVID to curb the spread of the virus, scientists say.</p>
<p>In an editorial for the journal Virulence, experts from the University of East Anglia (UEA) wrote that continued evolution of the virus in animals followed by transmission to humans "poses a significant long-term risk to public health".
"It is not unthinkable that vaccination of some domesticated animal species might... be necessary to curb the spread of the infection," they said.</p>
<p>Dogs and cats can contract coronavirus but there are no known cases in which there has been spillback to humans.
"It makes sense to develop vaccines for pets, for domestic animals, just as a precaution to reduce this risk," said Cock van Oosterhout, professor of evolutionary genetics at UEA.</p>
<p>"Interestingly the Russians have already started to develop a vaccine for pets, which there's very little information about."</p></p>
