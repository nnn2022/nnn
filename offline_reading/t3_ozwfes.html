        <p>I don't think they actually thought out their plan in this case (or any other really).</p>
<p>If a healthcare worker, or someone who works in a healthcare facility, doesn't the shot by September 15th they'll be "Suspended without pay." It's a shitty work-around to having to fire them and then paying unemployment (it's France so unless you quit, or get fired for specific reasons you get unemployment).</p>
<p>Since so many healthcare workers have said that they weren't getting the shot, and some have already gone on strike, they've "activated" the emergency response, called "Plan Blanc" which is basically a "All hands on deck", that recalls folks who are on vacation, and since it is an "Emergency" they cannot quit, nor go on strike.</p>
<p>There is a rumor that they will even send the police to your house and bring you to your work if necessary.</p>
<p>The whole thing is ludicrous because it assumes that the healthcare workers are going to play along, doesn't answer the question you have of "forcing the injection", and why in the world would anyone trust someone who is for all intent and purposes forced to do their job.</p>
<p>This will not end well...</p>

        <p>You're conflating socialized healthcare with state of emergency procedures.</p>
<p>I'm quite certain there is a similar procedures in place in the US that when "activated" would do the same, or if necessary some government representative could mandate it due to "State of Emergency".</p>

        <p>The hypocritic oath is basically a legally binding vow to save a patient's life no matter who they are and to not worry about payment until later. You also vow to do no harm on the job. But if you don't feel you can come in to work, that's between you and the hospital. It's still a job, one that you can quit if you so desire. So basically if you do come into work, you must save and stabilize every patient that comes your way. Doctors tend to even take it seriously outside the work place, like if they see someone bleeding on the side of the road or if someone has a heart attack at the next table over in a restaurant. But being forced by the government to come into work is still slavery.</p>

        <p>Considering the context of what you wrote I'm going to assume that auto-correct did it's thing and you meant "Hippocratic" and not "Hypocritic".</p>
<p>And I am not arguing that the emergency measures are basically "Slavery for the Greater Good^(TM)" especially in the current climate.</p>
<p>However, the Hippocratic Oath isn't legally binding, and the fact that we are seeing propaganda pieces like "And his last words was 'I should have taken the vaccine'" from doctors shows that medical secrecy isn't being respected (part of the oath), and that considering the ineffectiveness and side-effects from the COVID vaccines is not being disclosed nor acknowledged by doctors (in a general sense) the "Do no harm" is basically out the window as well.</p>
<p>None of this ties back to your original statement, nor to the fact that the US could in the case of declared "State of Emergency" use the same exact same methods that France is currently using.</p>
