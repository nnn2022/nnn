    <strong>I was watching web cameras from Russian cities today.</strong>
    <p><p>Like the title says I was watching webcams from Russian cities, typically just average, boring street corners. </p>
<p>The people by and large don’t have masks, were talking with each other, gathering together, there were street food vendors, buskers out, and it was just a nice, average day for these folks like we would have had before the pandemic.</p>
<p>I can’t do any of that and that nice average day is a distant memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel outside of my community is banned with threat of fine</li>
<li>If I leave the province I have to apply to renter and do a 14 day isolation</li>
<li>If I leave the country I am forced to isolate at a government facility upon return</li>
<li>I am required to wear a mask, even outside a lot of the time</li>
<li>I can be fined for not keeping distance from people</li>
<li>I can be fined for visiting friends and gathering with family</li>
<li>I’m only allowed to buy “essential” things and I often have to queue to enter the store</li>
<li>Protesting has been effectively banned and will get you fined/arrested</li>
<li>So many more things.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine taking a time machine to 1980 and telling people in 41 years Russian citizens will have more day to day freedom than you. They’d laugh at you, but here we are.</p></p>

        <p>It sounds like you're in canada which is one of the worst place to be right now. I'm with you except i have some points to add. You can leave your community and even your province with no repercussions. If you get stopped, you just need a reason. There was a girl online that showed the country you can get out of the "mandatory" hotels, it is a lengthy process though. I've never once been forced to wear a mask outside, even in ontario. Maybe you're in Toronto? The worldwide protest just happened and where I was, we weren't bothered by anyone. 
I'm just as angry as you about all of this but you don't have to comply with all of it. You'll be surprised at what you can get away with.</p>

        <p>Oh, and I've never been forced to only buy certain things in stores. I've never even seen a store that wasn't fully open. It must be really rough where you are. Sorry you're going through this.</p>
