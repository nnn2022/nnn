    <strong>Just another post venting frustration at the state of things.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a young person pursuing a career in healthcare. I have a deeply personal relationship to health because of my autoimmune disease. Since I was diagnosed with AID I've really opened my mind to lots of medical treatments both western and eastern, conventional and "alternative". The standard of care for most AID is medication plain and simple. In my experience anything else is straight up not encouraged. I became very skeptical of the western medical model right off the bat and turned to Chinese medicine and other alternatives. At times I feel more knowledgable about my disease than the specialist I see. I am super lucky to have a primary physician who is a DO and is very holistically minded, always checking for nutrient deficiencies blah blah throughout my life. I've been a regular supplement taker for some time now and truly know the benefit of getting the proper nutrients. </p>
<p>That being said I have been deeply saddened by the amount of people in health related industries who say things like "as long as people are still getting vaccinated we will make it out of this" or just generally go along with all the bullshit mandates with no question. its incredibly disheartening to want to share the valuable information I've learned about boosting immunity to live safe and healthy without fear or without getting vaccinated, and being told that its pseudoscience or that alternative medicine is quackery. I'm just so fucking sick of it. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>I hear you I work in healthcare too and if I was younger I would change careers at this point. This is my second career in life and I'm not doing this again I'm riding this out but I am so disgusted by what I see. I have personally encountered doctors who seem to be under some sort of a spell pushing the vaccine. And I know others who have as well. I thank God that quite a few of my co-workers see through this and they're not getting the vaccine and they have some very valid reasons, it's not just fear mongering or them being ignorant. I have learned through this that the people who I respected the most and are the most highly educated with the most advanced degrees and Specialties seem to be the most conformist. I always thought of them as smart, there's a big difference between educated and smart. They repeat what they hear, they don't think for themselves. They don't question looking outside the mainstream narrative. This has reinforced my way of thinking. I have always looked at every side of an issue and weighed the pros and the cons and I've always had a thirst for information. I never eliminate information based on a person being smeared or having negative things said about them. I think this is very difficult for a lot of people to do now. Most people are fear-based and being accepted as part of the group is very important to them. My general doctor is wonderful but he's retiring soon and I am going to be looking for a functional medicine doctor. I think this is the best way to go now I don't see myself ever going to a regular MD ever again without some sort of background in functional medicine.</p>

        <p>500 million years of animal evolution says that synthetic shit from the pharmacutical industry is alternative medicine.</p>
<p>Emergency or critical care is usually an entirely different conversation, but otherwise pharmaceutical corporation products are almost all a matter of <em>marketing</em>, NOT science.</p>
<p>They're the pseudoscience.  They call actual science "pseudoscience" to further their marketing agenda.</p>
<p>I generally don't like painting with a large brush like this because there can be a lot of different cases that don't really fit a given description that isn't well qualified.  I hope I've qualified these statements well enough...</p>
