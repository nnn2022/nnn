    <strong>Neo-Victorianism and the COVID-19 pandemic/lockdown/'new normal'</strong>
    <p><p>So i'm looking to do an interesting study, i'm part of a small minority of people (i would say its quite large, but most are in it for the novelty) known as Neo-victorians, if you want to know more then look at wikipedia, it involves indulging in victorian activities, following ettiqutte, dress code, speech, etc, it is about bringing the good of victorias reign into the modern day, and that made me wonder, are they're any other neo-victorians who have been affected by the lockdowns and 'new normal'?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So lets look at aspects of my life and what has been affected the most</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Things i didn't care about:</p>
<p>Not letting people borrow pens, mostly because i use fountain pens which are easily broken by inexperienced people used to ballpoint pens, the nib can also reform to the other persons hand</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Social distancing, because two people who don't want to distance will not</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Handshakes, i normally bow to people (but the court bow as that means hello)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Things it did affect:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Use of visiting cards, i couldn't give anyone a visiting card, not because it was an infection risk but i imagined people wouldn't take them anyway</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My very outward and social life, which is based around traditional victorian values was all but gone, i couldn't do a thing in the midst of the lockdown</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Traditional victorian values are still at threat, pubs, ships and the use of real money, and a life that doesn't involve talking to a peice of plastic</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For me personally i can't use my watch out in public because my mother insists everything is literally baptized in hand gel upon getting home, i don't want my vintage watch covered in alcohol thank you</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All my favorite antique shops have opened but they've got social distancing signs in the windows, my mom isn't letting me visit them yet but i'm worried too of perspex</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also i thought i'd add this, i was once told off for using a stair handrail in public, it's no more different then telling someone to die of a TBI </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So i'm looking for other neo-victorians who have been involved and had they're life affected by this whole thing and what they are doing to mitigate the effects on they're life, some neo-victorians run pubs too and i wouldn't be surprised if there is no social distancing or mask signs up.</p></p>

        <p>I understand what you're saying, I can't understand why you'd do the neo-victorian thing. But I feel you should be free to do it so we agree the lockdowns are bad.</p>
