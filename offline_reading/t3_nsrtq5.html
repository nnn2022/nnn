    <strong>Long Term Vaccine Dangers</strong>
    <p><h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The spike protein clearly seems to be the danger with the vaccine. My understanding is that it is a reproduction of the regular COVID-19 spike protein. Thus, concerning risks due to spike proteins, aren't the vaccine and COVID-19 equal in danger?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How long are people truly capable of shedding the vaccine? I've read 5 to 13 days, but I'm a little confused by this number. I think it is how long the proteins can live, but is there really only one "generation" so to speak of the proteins? I thought the vaccine turned your own body into the power plant, thus leading to spike proteins indefinitely. This logically sounds insane for a medical treatment to do, so surely someone can explain my error.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Follow Up Thoughts</h2>
<p>I have been searching for answers since posting, so I'll share my logic in progress.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vaccine supposedly has more spike proteins than the average infection of COVID. I have no idea if this is true, as I can't form the right query to get this answer anywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the only way that shedding would occur after the first lifecycle (as in, beyond the half life of the proteins) is if the body re-uptakes the mRNA, which is the coding for the protein. Some have said that the enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which all cells have, could do this. In fact, it is the job of this enzyme for normal situations. I don't know how the normal case and the mRNA for the spike protein might differ. Is the enzyme intelligent enough to not reuptake it?</p>

        <p>I have no idea about your second question so I won't postulate a completely ignorant opinion. As to your first question, yes there is no difference  wtween vaccine spike proteins and viral spike proteins, all the dangers of the latter apply to the former. Also, the vaccine poses a risk in that your own immune system will attack and destroy the cells that produce the spike proteins and there is evidence to show that the lipid nanoparticles that are the vehicles of the mRNA are not restricted to the injection site, in fact they make a beeline for the liver, spleen, ovaries, and to a lesser extent the uterus and bone marrow, as well as just about every part of your body in small amounts. In other words, your immune system is going to be attacking cells in all parts of your body, especially the female reproductive organs.</p>

<p>So I have a better picture here, how do the lipid nanoparticles play in? They are the farthest outside element of the vaccine â€” particles or droplets, or no? </p>
<p>The spike protein encases the mRNA, correct? So, I assume it would be lipid nanoparticle -&rt; spike protein -&rt; mRNA. You're saying that this entire package makes a beeline for sensitive parts of your body at the same time that the body is trying to actively attack the spike protein (and therefore the mRNA too). I'm guessing the body can't really detect the spike proteins until they are out of this lipid encasing, which doesn't happen all too often until they are already where they shouldn't be.</p>
<p>If the nanoparticle lipids are the things that cause this spread, then at least that's a good thing for people who don't get the vaccine but are worried about catching a shed, right? I would think we'd potentially get a few spike proteins but the lipids would be long gone at that point, unless the mRNA encodes for them too.</p>

        <p>No, the vaccine itself contains no spike proteins. The vaccine solution is basically a soup of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) in a solvent fluid. The LNPs encapsulate the very fragile mRNA and serve as a way to bypass the phospholipid bilayer of the human cell because they are hydrophobic. Once inside, the lipid nanoparticles dissolve and the mRNA is a blueprint that causes the host cell to manufacture the SARS-COV2 spike proteins. The spike proteins then are displayed on the exterior of the host cell's membrane, which is detected by the immune system cells and marks the host cell for destruction. </p>
<p>What people are worried about regarding shedding is the idea that people will have spike protein synthesis occurring in their lung cells and these will be exhaled out much like exosomes or viruses can be exhaled out of the mouth and nostrils, and entering another person.</p>
