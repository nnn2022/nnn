    <strong>Least favorite arguments and false equivalencies</strong>
    <p><p>What are some of the worst you've seen? Feel free to share your favorite responses as well.</p>
<p>I'll kick it off with:</p>
<p>It's like wearing a seatbelt.</p>
<p>We've always had "vaccine passports." You had to show them to go to school.</p>
<p>It's like a non smoking section in a restaurant. (in support of vaccine mandates)</p>
<p>Going out while unvaccinated is like drunk driving.</p></p>

        <p>But also, you probably never got that vaccine.  They stopped giving the smallpox vaccine to the public in 1972.  </p>
<p>The vast majority of the people who make the claim about the smallpox vaccine don't realize even they themselves haven't been vaccinated for smallpox either.  Because they don't know their history.</p>

        <p>Yeah man.  People who do not know their own history.  People who haven't done their own research who scream at you to "do more research".</p>
<p>Once you point out the fact neither one of you have had the smallpox vaccine, they will usually pivot and say, "see?  That's because it worked!"</p>
<p>Of course without realizing that was a direct contradiction to what they just said: That our smallpox vaccine (that we never got) protects us from smallpox.</p>
<p>By the way, if you believe the narrative it took only about 180 years to "eradicate" smallpox with the vaccine.  Only 180 years.  </p>
<p>If you're interested in a deep dive of this stuff: Dissolving Illusions by Suzanne Humphries.  She dismantles the vaccine narrative simply by showing the actual historical information.  The narrative we are getting, is not at all based on either history, nor science.  In fact, it appears to be a complete myth when examined more closely.  The problem is, almost no one ever questions or looks into the historical data.</p>

        <p>If you were born in the 90s you definitely didn't get it.</p>
<p>I know.  It's a weird thing to think about.  Do you know which vaccines you actually got and when?  Most of us don't know.  We don't even ask.  We don't ask for our children.  </p>
<p>The immunity for many of these vaccines doesn't even last more than ten years.  So there are probably dozens of viruses for which you and your pro vaxxer friend who promoted the smallpox vaccine are not even "immune" to, according to them.  You haven't gotten any of these viruses, because you have an immune system.</p>
<p>The vaccine debate is full of myths and half-truths, so many of which we just take for granted.  I've heard the smallpox vaccine argument dozens of times.  When I tell the speaker they didn't get the smallpox vaccine at first they call me a liar.  Then they say I'm crazy.  Then they say they didn't need it because it worked.  Which, moving the goalposts, is a direct contradiction to what they just said.  </p>
<p>But they don't even realize that, because they have never thought about it, and they don't know their history.</p>
<p>Challenge assumptions.</p>

        <p>Being healthy like working out and eating clean is like wearing a seatbelt, everyone can do it, protects you most of the time, but the vaccine is like relying on the airbags only.   </p>
<p>If your new car was made in 8 months, the first of its kind, the air bags may or may not work (you can still get infected), there may be manufacturer errors that take a few years to realize, etc.</p>

        <p>It is nothing like a seatbelt. False equivalency doesn't even begin to cover it. I can put my seatbelt on or take it off at my leisure. My vehicle might ding at me for a few minutes but I can choose to ignore it. Whether or not I put on my seatbelt doesn't have any impact on anybody else other than myself. If I choose to drive without a seatbelt I know I could end up through my windshield and I know this because there have been decades of studies regarding seat belt safety. </p>
<p>We had immunization requirements for school. They weren't vaccine passports, these cunts are trying to change language for their revisionist history. The thing about these immunization requirements is they actually eradicated these diseases. They are now extremely uncommon and we have to keep our herd immunity to protect those that are unable to receive them. If I am exposed to one of these diseases I will be safe because I have genuine immunity through my immunization. Polio is something you don't fuck around with. I never had to show my school vaccination record to go to the grocery store or go to the movies or a restaurant. Me having childhood vaccinations didn't have any impact on what I could do as an adult. This is another seriously disingenuous fucking argument.</p>
<p>It's like a non-smoking section? What the fuck does that even mean? Are they insinuating that my non-vaccinated lungs are constantly spewing a poisonous fucking toxic cloud of shit that they don't want to breathe in? Who do these cunts think they are thinking that their vaccinated lungs are incapable of expelling the same virus that it's proven they can transmit. These clowns are honestly the most disingenuous fucking morons I have ever had to deal with. If a person really wanted to make a non-smoking section argument then that argument should be the unvaccinated should stay away from the recently vaccinated because they are shedding their vaccine and spreading their fucking Spike proteins everywhere in a toxic cloud around them. Now the science is little iffy on how much they are spreading into the environment but there are antidotal stories about it at least making people feel really sick and fucking with menstrual cycles. </p>
<p>Driving drunk? I don't even know where to begin. Is it because a drunk driver might make it home or they might kill somebody and the unvaccinated might infect somebody or maybe they won't? Is that how this bullshit goes? The vaccinated get, are infected with, and transmit this virus as much as the unvaccinated so this is a non-argument. They infect people just as much. I will however suggest that maybe the analogy should be that a vaccinated person driving a car is a little bit like them driving drunk because at any moment they could have a fucking stroke, heart attack, seizure, or go fucking blind and they could kill somebody. There's a literal fucking time bomb in their bodies and if they are driving or flying a plane when it goes off people could get hurt or killed.</p>
