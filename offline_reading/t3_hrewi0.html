        <p>Oh, thank you for giving me the opportunity to vent, because I need to right now. I think a bunch of recluse losers are posting about how unsafe they feel. They want to ruin our society as we know it. I just want to live my life, and all of these people want to stay “safe.” Why don’t they just quarantine themselves? Why am I on house arrest because of their paranoia? I know this disease is real. It is. But some of use will take a small risk to enjoy our lives. It’s been FOUR f$&amp;&amp;ing months. I can’t get these months of my life back. How long will this continue?</p>

        <p>There is another archetype, similar in viewpoint but diametrically opposed in habitat.</p>
<p>The big house, big garden, remote work career, barely even notices any effect on their life except for fewer dinner parties.</p>

        <p>I live near one of those areas. Was great when we walked there at the beginning of this madness. All the posters in their windows "we are in this together".</p>
<p>No we are not you ****. I live in a place with no wide garden and a private playground, my kids had to suffer by not going to school, not excerising on playgrounds so you can tell yourself the story that you helped someone.</p>
<p>I hate these people.</p>

        <p>Also it's much easier to home school kids if you don't have to work or can afford tutors and materials (many homes don't have a computer each per child, or printers), some people are teaching kids and working full time.</p>

        <p>Every person I know, <strong>without exception</strong>, who has been aggressively pro-lockdown, was socially maladjusted, reclusive, friendless, and / or an outright social outcast for years, if not their entire lives, before this. The worst offenders have been those who also undertook little to no real initiative in taking steps to actively improve their situations in life, despite being miserable about it.</p>
<p>It's like they don't know how their social media feeds look to everyone else. Like, of course you've set your location to "social distancing" on Twitter and were posting aghast statuses about people for meeting friends or hanging out at the beach or whatever. <em>You've been "social distancing" for decades because you've never had a social life and it is extremely obvious that you have a vested interest in preserving the "new normal" to validate the hollowness of your existence.</em></p>
<p>If these people had an ounce of self-awareness, they would delete 90% of their public social media presence out of grinding shame.</p>

        <p>I’m a little fed up with skeptics stereotyping the opposition as lonely losers who can’t get laid. The people I see pushing stay at home online and elsewhere have friends and go out normally. They’ve just been overtaken by panic. Not to mention that many people want to leave lockdown because they’ve been without friends for the past few months at home.</p>
