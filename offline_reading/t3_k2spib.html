    <strong>Want greater than a 99% chance of NOT getting covid? Be in the placebo group of a vaccine trial.</strong>
    <p><p>The <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer vaccine trial</a> has 43,000 participants. Exact breakdown between treatment and placebo groups is not given, but they do provide number of covid cases in each group. Currently, there are 162 covid cases in the placebo group.</p>
<p>Assuming a 50/50 split, <strong>99.25% of the placebo group did not get covid.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, only 9 in the placebo group had a "severe case" and no one died. That is 99.96% in the placebo group did not have a severe case.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>We need to know the overall infection rate of the state/country where the participants lived during the time frame of the trial (July 27 - Nov 13) to make a fair comparison. Example: If the participants that lived in New York City during the dates of the trial tested 0.5% positive and NYC as a whole tested 0.1% positive, then being in the placebo group was at higher risk than the general population.  I just made up those numbers, but it's not possible to compare the placebo group to the general population without the location (among other attributes) of each participant. </p>
<h3>Estimation</h3>
<p>Even so, we can make an estimation as to how the placebo group compares to the overall population using the US as an example.  In the US, 7.4 million confirmed cases were recorded during the time frame of the trial equaling about 2.2% of the population. This number is approximately 3x higher than that of the placebo group (.75%). We know the real number of infections to be at least 3 or 4 times this amount. I'm not exactly sure how the participants in the trial were managed, but if all of them were tested, or at the least, kept a closer eye on, then the placebo group could have covid incident rate much lower than the general population.</p>
<h3>Applicability</h3>
<p>The participants in the trial come from a self-selected group healthier and younger than the population at large. Only 8 participants in the treatment group tested positive for covid, but I'm not sure how well these results will apply to those who are most at risk (Obese and diabetic people over the age of 70).</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>We have a vaccine trial where 99.25% of the placebo group did not have covid, 99.96% did not have a severe case, and 100% survived. The only thing this trial proves is how weak covid is on self-selected volunteers that are healthier and younger than the population most at risk.</p></p>

        <p>I think this is likely, but hard to draw a firm conclusion without more data. We need the location, age, sex, lifestyle, employment of each individual. The location matters the most if we want to make an apples to apples comparison. That said, I believe it's likely that the placebo group has a far lower incident rate than the general population.</p>

        <p>There is a <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine">here</a> in the article that shows somewhat the devesity of the participants but it doesn't say much about their life styles it claims that from 41% to 45% are betwin ages of 65 and 85</p>
<p>And the trails are beeing run in United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina</p>

        <p>Unfortunately those conclusions are accurate. For some reason CoVid-19 dislikes minor health issues like obesity and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>If I had not read the data showing that CoVid-19 is a natural virus straight from Johns Hopkins Hospital and places I respect... I would honestly be tin-foil hatting right now with "It's a man-made virus!"</p>
<p>Doubt it is man-made when it has been going around since Summer 2019 in the United States according to new data.</p>
<p>I think it just finally hit the 'Hell spot' of very contagious and very lethal to people over 60 and with minor pre-ex's.</p>

        <p>Obesity is one of the clearest signs that your health is poor. Man is meant to be quite lean. Even the Inuit, the indigenous people roaming the arctic, only keep a minimum amount of extra adipose tissue (as compared to say indigenous Africans) required for their survival.</p>
<p>I'd say obesity is a major health issue. Active people who exercise, lift weights, stay lean, cut refined carbohydrates and seed oils have far less health issues overall and are much more robust if covid strikes. Being lean may not give you many more years or save you from cancer when you are 70+, but you should have much fewer health issues throughout your life.</p>

        <p>Obesity <strong>does not</strong> necessarily mean that your health is poor. I have been overweight for 16 years and the doctor says taking into account that my blood pressure has been high since I was <strong>underweight</strong> in high school, I am actually healthier than most right weight people he sees in his office.</p>
<p>I can do the 30 yard dash in a reasonable time, I can jog just fine for a good 200 feet, etc.</p>
<p>Basically if you could not see that I was about 40 pounds overweight by having me described to you? You would think that I was an average right weight person.</p>

        <p>Obesity means your health is poor enough that a cold can kill you. I am sure your physician is excellent at what he does, but he nevertheless is trained on a paradigm that focuses on a few narrow metrics that have been clearly understood and to disregard what has not yet been categorised. Part of the pressure there is political pressure against even just pointing out that fat people are fat, never mind pointing out that they are unhealthy. </p>
<p>Anyway, feel free to downvote and ignore. It is your health, not mine, not your physician's. You need to decide whether to ignore the evidence of the impact of minor diseases on the obese, which has always been there for those of us who don't need the media to be aware of such things, or whether to take the hit to your ego and the challenge of changing your lifestyle to improve your health and quality of life.</p>

        <p>It does not mean your health is poor.  It simply increases the odds that your health will <em>become</em> poor.  For many people, the odds of developing problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, fatty liver, etc are greatly increased by obesity.  </p>
<p>I was obese for a couple years and then lost 65lbs from 2016-2019.  Unfortunately I'm still about 30lbs overweight as the stress of living in Clown World has led me to drink and eat more than I ought to, but like you my health stats are all good.  I hike every day and am addicted to backpacking.  I run and do light dumbbell workouts to cross-train.  Cholesterol is great, blood pressure's great, heart rate is great, etc.  But I remember what it was like being obese, and I am very determined to never end up that way again.  I had so much less energy, I was binge-drinking nightly, my skin and hair were dull, I got chafing when I exercised, my sleep was crappy (snoring more), I was hungry all the time and I had terrible self-esteem issues.  Even though I didn't have any problems develop during the years of being obese, I found that how I felt living in my skin improved vastly once I lost the weight.</p>

        <p>&rt;Obesity <strong>does not</strong> necessarily mean that your health is poor</p>
<p>yes, it does.  one fat person's health might be less poor than some fatter person's, and even better than some very sickly thin person's, but that doesn't mean the fat person is healthy-- they are mutually exclusive.  you can't be tall and short, so how could you be fit and fat?</p>
