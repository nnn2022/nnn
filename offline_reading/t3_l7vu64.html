<p>I think COVID is a big deal too. It's definately more deadly than the common cold or influenza to older people and even younger people with certain health conditions. It's concerning to say the least.</p>
<p>That being said... I'm on this sub because I agree with most of these people that it still doesn't justify the response we have seen to it thus far...</p>

        <p>I too agree with you for some part, I am from the netherlands and the goverment suck at doing something against it. I would have treated things differently for sure but maybe more effective in a short term so we could enjoy more of the long term (bit like australia of what I have heard)</p>

        <p>The bad science actually isn't in their favor. The media's hyperbolic and context-free paraphrasing of the science and the health official's implementation of safety measures are what is driving this. I don't necessarily think there is bad science as long as the parameters are clearly stated in the publication. Unfortunately we have everyone in power declaring fatwas on what doesn't seem to be more information than skimming abstracts.</p>

        <p>Why is that? Let's say you are right than we can always prove it. Just so you know when I do an experiment we always test if it works even if 100000 papers already say it works. Why? Cause there are so many uncertainties which you can't always account for except by doing the expirement yourself. So I honestly don't think it's "bad science" or you are specifically talking about covid science?</p>

        <p>If you want a debate, then you need to present a question at least. We know the topic, but give people a jumping off point. Start where you want the most info from, since this is your idea. </p>

        <p>Okay, I want to know what makes you think that this is more of a plan of the goverment to get more power? I agree that some big companies are definitely profiting of this situation but that has always been the deal cause they have money to make those moves. Which I by the ways also definitely hate.</p>
<p>Further more, how do you explain the stories of people suffering from the disease in the ER and so on. You can't hide something which every hospital should be going through cause than most people from healthcare would know it was fake. You can't persuade such a big group to lie.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me know that I had no real concrete question and I hope people can keep discussing.</p>

        <p>Sweden, hailed as the great example of now not to behave, has overall all-cause mortality rates in line with the rest of the last decade.  This is true of most of Europe, regardless of interventions, their stringency, or their timing.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, on the other hand, have caused untold misery and death, and will continue to for a decade or more, as the economy is one of the best predictors for overall health and well-being, and we have pushed something like 150 million more people into extreme poverty worldwide.  Every western country has pushed huge portions of the population back in to their locally-defined poverty as well.  Mental health has suffered, healthcare has suffered immensely because people aren't getting tested for what they might have, or treated for what they do have.  Vaccine administration has dropped by 50+% (we're talking MMR, TDAP, polio, hep, etc).  Education is currently a joke, and impact of the de-socialization of kids won't be understood for many years.</p>
<p>Covid has killed people, but however bad it is, these lockdowns are worse in every possible way.</p>
<p>This is the general stance of people here.</p>

        <p>Definitely a good point, I think this has arisen from the problem that is politics, not that smart people making decisions about something they don't know much about.</p>
<p>I think to solve this problem the committee making choices for your country should be doctors, psychologist and people who know what would help generally. </p>
<p>I don't know which precautions you disagree with but I know that over here in the netherlands we know have a curfew... It only makes things worse cause know people just hang out before the curfew, a bad precaution.</p>
<p>Only 1 person may be in someone elses house, so what happens is that a couple splits up so 1 goes with friend a and the other with friend B, makes the amount of people you have contact with higher while following the rules, a bad precaution.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with this, as I think this is a major part of the overreaction this past year. </p>
<p>Health professionals' only focus is limiting health risks, which is great, that's their job. But that's why they advise decision makers (i.e. a governer) who balance those risks with other things like economic stability, education, and other aspects of public welfare. </p>
<p>What we have seen is the health departments having full control over the population, which we willingly gave to them at the beginning of this when the argument was still "flatten the curve" and based off the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01003-6">Imperial Model</a>. And they are just doing their job, they were told to limit deaths of Covid-19 and they are doing everything in their power to do that. This has turned into some bizarre <em>keep the humans safe at all costs</em> out of I, Robot (the movie). </p>
<p>The problem here is that even as the apparent dangers of this virus decreased drastically with new data, health officials and the general populace (with the help of the media shoving every single death down their throats) were already geared up to find every single death unacceptable. Somehow everyone forgot that old people die and that humans aren't immortal. Or maybe people were just blissfully unaware of all this until the news reported on it non-stop for 10 months. </p>
<p>For some reason we never took back control, and I really don't fully understand why we didn't other than media-induced mass hysteria and maybe health officials drunk with power. </p>
<p>I am eager to see the studies on the sociological aspects of the Covid-response in 10 years, because so far the response has been much more dramatic than the disease.</p>

        <p>Thank you for pointing out that I was a bit short sighted while talking about the team of responders, I knew I forgot some people. We would also need for example economists in there (there are probably more but you get the point).</p>
<p>Yes I agree humans aren't immortal but covid seems more impact full to the human body than normal disease and it is about trying to limit the deaths.</p>
<p>I think you aren't as different minded as me as you think. I don't think health officials are being drunk on power or something alike, I think the problem lies in using over the top methods to fight it while you could lessen those and use more effective and less intrusive.</p>

        <p>Individuals are usually pretty similar, when we get forced into groups via what side certain opinions fall, the differences in opinion are amplified. </p>
<p>A lot of the philosophical differences at stake here are akin to positive rights vs negative rights, if you are interested in researching very different definitions of human rights. From what I have seen, a lot of people against the lockdowns are supporters of negative rights but people for then are in favor of positive rights. </p>
<p>I apologise if you are already well-versed in this. Your country is the home to some of the more extreme versions of positive rights so I understand that our perspectives come from very different starting points.</p>

        <p>My opinion is that we're sacrificing everyone's lives to save the lives that represent a very small subset of the population. Instead, we should be focusing on protecting the vulnerable instead of 'protecting' everyone. Lockdowns do far more harm than good.</p>

        <p>Good point, so your idea would be more of a let the vulnerable stay safe. The problem for me would be my father, I have to go to school and maybe get infected which I wouldn't mind, but my father with a condition could get infected and be killed by it. How would that be solved?</p>

        <p>Nothing we post will really have an impact on you because you still believe the news is truth and governments work for the people. Until you are willing to accept the possibility that everything you've been told is a lie, and governments have been bought and are controlled by "money" (for lack of a less crazy sounding term), you won't be able to objectively look at the facts. We could show you all the stats in the world, but your mind would rationalize them as falsehoods. It's called cognitive dissonance. The fact is, the only "facts" you have on your side is what you are told by politicians on the news. Once you realize that those are lies, you have nothing. However, it's a giant hurdle to realize the world is not what you thought</p>

        <p>Just so you know I hate the news because it always seems to say so have this opinion on it. Big agree on that.</p>
<p>Furthermore I also think politicians are not good (bribed or not( btw im from the netherlands) so I never listen to them either cause either they aren't smart enough to make decisions on their own or they are bribed to do this.</p>
<p>I always get my sources of the Internet from different kinds of papers and I try to cross reference as much as I can. I always try to doubt everything, be it being pro lockdown or anti.</p>
<p>But hey you said that even if you showed data it wouldn't work, why don't you try your theory?</p>

        <p>It's deeper. When I used the term "news" I really meant to encompass all main stream media. Politicians? Irrelevant. Government doesn't exist. If you are on this sub it surely can't be that hard to read the occasional post, why are you asking me for stats? Just read them, there is a lot of information here, but maybe your intention isn't actually knowledge. What evidence do you have that covid is any worse than a seasonal flu? Any?? I've looked hard and can't find anything. Why don't you enlighten me?</p>

        <p>&rt;Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 more frequently developed acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, or haemorrhagic stroke than patients with influenza, but less frequently developed myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza (15 104 [16·9%] of 89 530 vs 2640 [5·8%] of 45 819), with a relative risk of death of 2·9 (95% CI 2·8–3·0) and an age-standardised mortality ratio of 2·82.</p>
<p>Source: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30527-0/fulltext</p>
<p>This study made us of data gotten from france in particular.</p>
<p>&rt;Results Compared with seasonal influenza, covid-19 was associated with higher risk of acute kidney injury (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 1.69), incident renal replacement therapy (4.11, 3.13 to 5.40), incident insulin use (1.86, 1.62 to 2.14), severe septic shock (4.04, 3.38 to 4.83), vasopressor use (3.95, 3.46 to 4.51), pulmonary embolism (1.50, 1.18 to 1.90), deep venous thrombosis (1.50, 1.20 to 1.88), stroke (1.62, 1.17 to 2.24), acute myocarditis (7.82, 3.53 to 17.36), arrythmias and sudden cardiac death (1.76, 1.40 to 2.20), elevated troponin (1.75, 1.50 to 2.05), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (3.16, 2.91 to 3.43), elevated alanine aminotransferase (2.65, 2.43 to 2.88), and rhabdomyolysis (1.84, 1.54 to 2.18). Compared with seasonal influenza, covid-19 was also associated with higher risk of death, mechanical ventilator use, and admission to intensive care (hazard ratio 4.97, (95% confidence interval 4.42 to 5.58), 4.01 (3.53 to 4.54), and 2.41 (2.25 to 2.59), respectively) and 3.00 (2.20 to 3.80) additional days of hospital stay. Differences in rates of death per 100 patients between covid-19 and seasonal influenza were most pronounced in people over 75 years of age with chronic kidney disease or dementia and those with black race and obesity, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.
Conclusions Among people admitted to hospital, compared with seasonal influenza, covid-19 was associated with increased risk of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, death, and increased health resource use.</p>

        <p>Sure, first (from the WHO's own website)  less than 10% of covid deaths were without coincidental health conditions. Doctors were mandated to put covid patients on respirators, which made conditions worse and were not allowed to treat the respiratory conditions with hydroxychloroquine, which is protocol. Covid deaths are defined as deaths by any cause, within 28 days of a positive test, which unfortunately renders the stats meaningless. The fact that the doctors were not allowed to treat the patients in the same manner might lead to differing results. The problem here, is the stats are unreliable. Incentivizing doctors to record covid patients and deaths has skewed all stats. 
I'm not here to win an argument. This is not about covid for me. I truly hope that you wake up to what is really going on. The covid narrative is just an example of how corrupt and controlled the governments are. It might be too much for you to digest right now. If it wasn't on the news 24/7, you wouldn't even know it existed, yet you have no rights. Masks, curfews and lockdowns have been arbitrarily mandated with no scientific justification. Coronaviruses mutate every year. That has been scientific fact for a number of years. We haven't even been able to isolate the strain, and don't have a specific test for it. We have a PCR test. Yet suddenly, there's a new strain (how do they know?) It's more contagious and deadly than 19 (how do they know?). 
Again, this is not about covid. Hopefully covid can wake the masses to the tyranny.
Even if covid were everything the biased stats said, the draconian measures have done more harm than good. 
I am only urging you to open your eyes and use common sense.
In the Philippines, 8000 people out of a population of more than 100 million are dead. With 3 of the most densely populated cities in the world, with abject poverty and poor sanitation. Over 10 million families are starving as a result of the lockdowns, yet you believe the government cares about their health. Maybe from your point of view, locked in your home in a first world country things don't look so bad. I urge you to look closer. You have no rights to go places maskless, travel, visit friends and relatives, run a business, provide for your own family, or question the narrative, yet you don't even question it.
Who has the better track record when it comes to predictions this year?
The "experts" or conspiracy theorists?
Just 2 weeks.
Do your own research, I'm not here to win a stupid argument about numbers</p>

<li>conspiracy theory nut jobs</li>
<li>paranoid, and delusional about the "gubmint"</li>
<li>science deniers</li>
<li>selfish, grandma and pappy killers</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't believe me? Look at the sub-reddits that are for the lockdowns, vaccines and any sub-reddits that discussions COVID-19. Look at what happens when a dissenting opinion is posted. Watch on how that individual is attacked, look at what the mainstream media is calling us. </p>
