        <p>When trees blossom, it is because temperature and climatic changes are causing that tree to produce fruit. In the microlevel of the body, the same is true. The body is the microcosm of the outer macrocosm (universe) we observe. </p>
<p>What we call cold happens yearly because the body, on a cyclical basis, is signaled to dump mass stored toxins. This occurs at the cellular level. Climate/seasonal changes bring about humidity and temperature changes which increase bioactive functions of cells, through moisture and/or oxygen absorption. These biochemical signals cause cells to release stored toxins—it is cellular processes being maintained through cell survival mechanisms; a sort of house cleaning. Bacterium also increases during colder months, as they flourish in the blood due to a lowered bodily temperature. When they proliferate, they feed upon debris in the tissue and blood. </p>
<p>When they consume such matter, they excrete it into a utilizable form for white blood cells and other cleansing cells, such as phagocytes, to further eliminate and or recycle for use by the body. The body discards 90% of toxins through the skin. The rest expel via the bowels, mouth, and mucus membranes. Depending upon the toxicity and nature of those substances, parasites or fungus may be utilized to help break them down. But when substances are too toxic for these living microbial agents to consume without dying, a non-living agent must be created by the body as a last resort.</p>
<p>What happens is we have microzyma that are precursors to bacteria and blood cells. They will change form (pleomorph) depending on external environment.</p>
<p>Illness always comes from within--your thoughts, what you eat, what you drink, the toxins; these are what cause illness. The only thing your body can do is expel morbid matter. This is what we call symptoms and suppression of this natural process (by use of antiemetics, etc.) leads to chronic disease.</p>
