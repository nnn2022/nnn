    <strong>You are stuck in an echo chamber</strong>
    <p><p>When it's all you hear from the TV.</p>
<p>When it's all you hear from social media.</p>
<p>When politicians and celebrities can't stop talking about it.</p>
<p>When you can't question the other side without being called dumb, selfish, or ignorant.</p>
<p>When you get banned from random subs for commenting here. </p>
<p>When the other side is censored and demonized. </p>
<p>When you need to preface comments with ''I'm not a _____, but''.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You are stuck in an echo chamber. YOU are in the wrong. Wake the fuck up. You are the selfish one. ''My body, my choice'' in 2019 but ''My body, our choice'' in 2021. Seriously, how lost are some of you? People shout MY BODY MY CHOICE when it's convenient to THEM, but when the tables turn, they drop that ideology and bandwagon on the next one. You are nothing more than an obedient puppet who genuinely can't think for themselves. </p>
<p>I try to see the best in people, I really do, but over the course of these last few months, some people are just not there mentally. I mean how the fuck can you not see this? Ask yourself questions. Stop being afraid of yourself. You aren't even ''you'' at this point. You follow orders like a dog because tHe GoVeRnMeNt WoUlD nEvEr HuRt ItS pEoPle. All throughout human life there has been situations when the ruling class takes over the lower class, and it's happened time after time because people can't stick up for themselves and think. You need to be coddled by the Big Daddy because you are weak and follow orders without ever second guessing them. </p>
<p>When was censoring the opposing side EVER a winner trait? Why censor? Why censor and scrub the name of the <strong>doctor who CREATED the mRNA technology, just because he said it was dangerous?</strong> Jesus people use your heads. I don't care if you had the shot, I honestly wish you the best and hope you are safe. But to the people who willingly comply to this and try to FORCE others to get a fucking VACCINE, please rethink everything. You are stuck in a false reality. I know it sounds crazy and to you it is crazy, but the crazier this sounds to you, the deeper you are stuck in the delusions created by a group of people who have bad intentions. I used to think this COVID stuff was a real problem back in early 2020, but then I compared what I saw with my own eyes in real life and what was portrayed in the media and it did not add up, so I know how ''crazy'' this post sounds and you'd probably write me off as a crazy and delusional person, but at the very least you could question what information is being fed to you. </p>
<p>Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs funny how they will call this an echo chamber, when almost every post is brigaded by these people.</p>
<p>Pretty sure most that show up here telling people to take he shot are paid to do so.</p>
