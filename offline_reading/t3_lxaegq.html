    <strong>Vaccine question - please read, especially anyone with a medical or scientific background. I haven’t seen this brought up before.</strong>
    <p><p>I have no formal medical or scientific background, but I do understand the basics of how vaccines and the immune system work and the difference between a traditional vaccine and an RNA/DNA vaccine. I’m not anti-vaccine in general, just highly skeptical of these ones.</p>
<p>My question is this. The way the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines work is that mRNA enters your cells and causes them to manufacture the covid spike protein, which is what your immune system actually develops antibodies against (not the vaccine itself, which is how they usually work.) </p>
<p>So why can’t they develop a vaccine where they just inject you with the straight spike protein? Why do your cells have to manufacture it and then die to release the spike proteins into your bloodstream?</p>
<p>I would love it if anyone with a medical or scientific background could provide an explanation for this. u/dr-mcluvin, maybe you could weigh in if you feel so inclined? Or u/talkgeneticstome if you’re still around?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who responds.</p></p>

        <p>Alright I'll take a stab at this one for you. You need to make the choice for yourself on the vaccine I'm just trying to provide information. The media, some scientist, and the general public have been far to focused on antibody production when it comes to the vaccines. Those are not the key to long term sustained immunity. </p>
<p>T-Cell response is the key. Why this is important. Studies of individuals who have recovered from MERs and SARS-COV-1 (original SARS) still have an immune response to those viruses and now Covid-19. This comes from memory T-Cells. Now that doesn't mean you won't get sick (that's what antibodies do) but your course through the virus will be shorter and without severe symptoms. There is scientific research that these coronavirus memory cells may last a lifetime. This is additionally why there was the belief that exposure to one of the other 4 "mild" coronaviruses caused 30% of the population to be "immune" to the disease already. </p>
<p>Generally just giving a dose of antibody proteins will not produce these T-Cells. That's where genetic code vaccines come in. They have the ability to produce that T-Cell response that is key to immunity. This effect is not as strong as actually, getting, and fighting off the disease. But not having to catch the virus, is potentially safer for some segments of the population.</p>
<p>Anyway, a professor from California at Berkeley wrote a paper on this exact question. Good read and the link is below. </p>
<p>https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/09/09/for-an-effective-covid-vaccine-look-beyond-antibodies-to-t-cells/</p>
<p>The other thing to watch out for is antibody dependent enhancement, it was a problem with dengue fever and early coronavirus vaccines. Basically antibodies work opposite and help virus get into your cells and makes the sickness worse.</p>

        <p>It's kind of like ikea furniture. You might pay less, but then you have to put in the labor to build it yourself. The simple answer is that It's cheaper and quicker to make for the companies. There's also a lot of assumptions and theories about how it actually works and how safe it is.</p>

        <p>Ya so what you are describing is what’s called a “peptide” vaccine. Which is actually one of the Russian vaccines in development. They are currently doing what we might call a phase 2 trial for it as we speak. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/EpiVacCorona</p>
<p>There are caveats to these vaccines including:
-Higher risk of developing an allergic response to a foreign protein than a protein that your cells are actually producing themselves. 
-the immune response tends to be not as robust (probably due to weak T cell response)
-the immune response is likely not going to be as long-lived (they are already saying you may need a booster every 3-6 months for the Russian EpivacCorona vaccine).</p>

        <p>The purpose of the v is to INTERFERE WITH THE FUNCTION OF FURINS - specifically those used by the virus.  HOWEVER - FURINS ARE UTILIZED BY EVERY HUMAN BODILY SYSTEM.  And as scientists mentioned during the development of the V the trouble is that most of these injections which interfere with FURIN ACTIVITY... Are non specific... ie they interfere with EVERY SYSTEM OF THE BODY ON A CELLULAR LEVEL.  Anyways... </p>
<p>I am compiling reports of injury following the V to spread awareness. Continually updated and reposted as frequently as it's deleted.</p>

        <p>Adding onto the other poster with the IKEA reference to say that the mRNA vaccines are definitely safe. Do consider getting the shot if you have the opportunity. The mRNA vaccine technology has been developing at an admirable place for years and the trial data for the Modena and Pfizer are very encouraging. I foresee the extermination of a lot of pesky infectious diseases through the use of this cutting edge tech.</p>
