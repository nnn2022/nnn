        <p>South American here. To be fair, there is no lockdown in Uruguay just basic restrictions.</p>
<p>To me this is just proof that you cannot run away from the virus. It will attack the population sooner or later.</p>

        <p>To play the devil's advocate here, I think the plan of those lockdown places (eg: New Zealand) is to run away from the virus until everyone has been vaccinated. That way, by the time the virus comes, they will be more protected.</p>
<p>Of course, there's now growing evidence that there are variants resistant to the vaccines (eg: the South African variant), and those could be the dominant strain a month from now. I do not know what the lockdown states will want to do against those. Some believe they will just give up and let people die while others believe they will be on an eternal lockdown. Usually, the truth is somewhere in the middle. We'll see. :)</p>

        <p>Also to play devils advocate, George Soros and Fauci said the vaccine will take years, my theory is the plan was to destroy the economy during that time but operation warpspeed threw a spanner in the works, not that I trust Trump or the poison jab</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying. Personally, I don't think Fauci wants to destroy the economy. I think he's just a politician doing what he's paid to do. He has a narrative of saving lives, and I think this is being mostly financed by the people themselves. Politicians do what people want to get their votes. People want lockdowns, politicians do lockdowns. And yes, people DO want lockdown (as someone living in a democrat city, it's everywhere).</p>
<p>Now why do they want lockdowns? Plenty of reasons. For example, some are simply liking their new WFH lifestyle. Others are dead in fear, and all they can process is keeping people away from them. Others like getting paid by the government without having to do any work. Others are actually getting more money due to the lockdown.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and this is something all of us in this sub can agree with: people are short-sighted to demand lockdowns. They are not balancing their emotions with their reasoning. They are not seeing the big picture past covid deaths. They trust the government perhaps a bit too much, and they don't see freedom as something as important as life itself.</p>
