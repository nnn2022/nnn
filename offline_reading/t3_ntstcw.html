    <strong>Answers to commonly asked questions</strong>
    <p><p>Question - Natural immunity is better than the immunity given by the vaccine, isn't it?</p>
<p>Answer - it can be, but not guaranteed. There are plenty of studies that prove that vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity. A few examples of this are:</p>

<p>https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/29/which-is-better-for-developing-immunity-covid-19-vaccine-or-natural-infection/</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/answering-questions.html</p>
<p>/------------/</p>
<p>Question - Why are people forcing me to get the vaccine, or wear a mask?</p>
<p>Answer - they're not. No one is. People may judge you. People may want to encourage you. People may be quite passionate about it. They may seriously believe it is in the best interests of society as a whole. You may disagree. That's fine. No one will force you. You don't need to get angry about people forcing you. It's not happening.</p>
<p>/------------/</p>
<p>Question - it's a bit suspicious that doctors have changed their minds about masks and social distancing, isn't it?</p>
<p>Answer - not really. This was a pandemic the likes of which this generation hasn't seen before. People aren't going to have the right answers immediately. Scientists are led by the numbers. At the start, they would have had one opinion, and it's perfectly reasonable and common to change minds as time goes on, and numbers change. That isn't a conspiracy. It's just simply changing their mind. It would be more weird if they didn't change their mind as they learnt more!</p>
<p>/------------/</p>
<p>Question - the vaccine hasn't been tested properly and isn't approved, is it?</p>
<p>Answer - you're right. It's not been formally approved. It's been authorised under emergency use, because we're in an emergency situation. The entire point of the EUA is for pandemics. So it's appropriate. Approval will take a while. However, authorisation, even emergency one, will require a whole host of standards to be met. These have been met. Multiple independent organisations have confirmed they are safe. Every country in the world are happy to accept them. However, if you prefer to wait, that's your right. Again, no one is forcing you.</p>
<p>/------------/</p>
<p>Question - the side effects of the vaccine are worse than Covid for my age range, so why would I get the vaccine?</p>
<p>Answer - vaccines are built to prompt the biggest possible immune response, in order to give you the biggest possible immunity. As a result, side effects are likely. These are incredibly rarely dangerous. Obviously, some people will have allergic reactions or other problems. The chances of the vaccine causing a problem is much less than the chances of Covid causing you a problem, whatever your age. Once again, it's a personal choice. No one is forcing you. It's scientifically and medically recommended for all ages, and if you get the Pfizer, the risk is even lower.</p>
<p>/------------/</p>
<p>Question - lockdowns caused bigger problems, we should have just let Covid run through society and keep businesses open, right?</p>
<p>Answer - sure, that's a very valid opinion. Lockdowns did cause financial problems. People lost jobs. No one is denying that. It was the opinion of almost every government in the world that locking down to stop Covid spreading was worth it. Even the countries that didn't lock down changed their minds pretty quickly. It is pretty rare in history that all countries agree, but they agreed on this. So, I think that counts for something. So, it was simply their decision. You are entirely allowed to have a different opinion, and there are strong arguments both ways. There is no correct answer. Both options were bad.</p>
<p>/------------/</p>
<p>Question - all of the media is in on a big conspiracy to get people locked into their house and get a vaccine to increase the profits of the rich, so why should we believe anyone?</p>
<p>Answer - firstly, that doesn't seem likely. Secondly, again, no one is forcing you to do anything. Thirdly, this conspiracy would require collaboration by a huge number of people, across every country, a hundred medical disciplines, and that just isn't reasonable. Now, over lockdown, the rich probably did get richer. Obviously, things like Amazon, Zoom, etc were used more. That's an effect of the lockdown, not the reason for it. People seem to be forgetting that generally, businesses do better if people have money, and lockdown caused a lot of people financial problems. It simply wouldn't have been a very good plan if that was their aim.</p></p>

        <p>No one is forcing you to do anything, it's just in your head, you are the crazy one. No conspiracy here. Why, you ask? Well, just not likely.</p>
<p>Evaluation of lockdown effectiveness stuck at March 2020. "There is no correct answer." When we compare countries with different lockdown measures, yes, there is a correct answer. "It wouldn't have been a very good plan." I'll say more: it's absolutely terrible plan, but they did it anyway, because even before the elites were jumping through multiple hoops, or, as one would call them, extra steps, designed just to arrange the flow of capital into the hands of the elite while maintaining the facade of free democratic society. This plan does not make any sense, but their life, which only has greed and control as the only purposes, makes no sense either. To pretend this hierarchy is the natural way of things is extreme intellectual cowardice. If the scientists change their minds all the time, they may change them again, which will mean the society was a blind following the blind this whole time. All vaccines are apparently safe and effective, but Pfizer is extra super safe and mega duper effective. If emergency authorization is so safe and robust, why even have FDA approval? Never mind thousands of people who have already died shortly after getting vaccinated. Never mind the clusters of "breakthrough" cases that happened after vaccination campaigns, particularly in care homes. Never mind that spike protein is toxic. Never mind the massive data massage and manipulation, regarding the trials. Never mind that everyone knows, that the manufacturers were not going to back away from selling their vaccines if any issues arose (they did). Never mind anything, never question anything, trust the government, transparency is unnecessary, elitism is normal, public trust is overrated, keep calm and carry on, nothing to see here, citizen!</p>

        <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand covid-19 and vaccines. The science is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the facts will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Fauci's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his persona - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The left understands this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these truths, to realize that they're not just factual- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike distancing and masks truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the science in Fauci's existencial catchphrase "Trust the Science," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Cuomo and Newsom's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Bernie 2016 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.</p>
