    <strong>Let's talk about mandatory ChinaVirus testing...</strong>
    <p><p>In the (perfectly justified) uproar over mandatory WuFlu vaccines, there has been very little discussion about mandatory <em>testing</em>. It is becoming a fait accompli for international travel and border crossings, without any real debate, discussion, or oversight. If serious pushback doesn't happen soon, it may become a reality that intrudes on all aspects of daily life.</p>
<p>Of course, the doomers will argue that "It's just a swab up your nose, what's the big deal?"</p>
<p><em>It is a big deal.</em> The principles at play are no different than forcing one to submit to the vaccine. <em>You are being forced, against your will, to submit to a medical procedure - to access non-medical services, with your information thrown out there for God-knows-who (including nosy governments) to see.</em></p>
<p>It's the health version of "Guilty until proven innocent".</p>
<p>Where does it stop?</p>
<p>- Will you need a test proving you don't have TB, or Hepatitis, or Measles to buy groceries? Once the precedent is established using The Rona, what is stopping this from happening?</p>
<p>- Going to a bar to pick up a companion for some night time "recreation"? Want to join Tinder? Imagine if you had to provide proof you weren't carrying an STD before you were allowed to join the hook-up game?</p>
<p>- Want to get pregnant? Who's to say tests against various heritable genetic diseases can't be mandated? Better hope you are of pure and clean blood, Citizen!</p>
<p>- How about some nice, invasive psych testing prior to getting hired for a job? After all, doesn't Target have the "right" as a private business to make sure they aren't hiring "Son of Sam"?</p>
<p>The possibilities for abuse are endless, and chilling. And no one, other than a few posters here, seem to be talking about it.</p></p>

        <p>The fuckery post 9/11 should have set off alarm bells, but the sheeple were too busy looking for terrorists under their beds.</p>
<p>Air travel and border crossings set the precedent for "rights-free zones", and no one seemed to notice or care.</p>

        <p>The worst part is, I can see them using the test as a way to force people to get the vaccine. They'll already be in the system, it isn't that much of a stretch to say if someone's tested positive already they're more likely to get it again or catch the new strain or some bs and require those people to get the vaccine. By submitting to a test to travel, work, go to college, whatever, they are putting their name in the health department and adding to the artificially inflated case statistics. People who get "tested" lose their rights. they can force you to wear an ankle bracelet and put police in front of your house if you test positive then decide you feel ok enough to stop quarantining and get caught. Basically, the tests pave the way for the vaccines.</p>

        <p>That's why from the beginning of this farce, I have told everyone I know that under no circumstances will I get tested for ChinaVirus.</p>
<p>You will end up in a database, forever.</p>
<p>I've also told them "If you go get tested, and shop me out to a contact tracer as a 'close contact', I will make you suffer."</p>
