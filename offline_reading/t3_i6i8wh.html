    <strong>If you 100% didn't want to catch covid-19, you wouldn't</strong>
    <p><p>I really don't understand what people don't get about this point. If you don't want to catch covid, other people being outside is not going to force you to catch it. In fact, the only people who would be outside if all restrictions were lifted would be ones who didn't care about the risk. This is the same with nearly everything - if you don't want to be in a car crash, you won't be (don't drive); if you don't want to die from alcohol poisoning, you won't (don't drink); if you don't want an STD, you won't get one (don't have sex). </p>
<p>This constant rubbish about 'selfishness' is getting very irritating. Someone living their lives as they always have isn't selfish, demanding everyone else live the way you want them to - that is selfish. The only people who would be at risk of covid with restrictions lifted are the ones willing to accept the risk. You can stay inside for years if you want, you can wear a hazmat suit outside, you can get everything delivered and spray it all down. Yeah you might lose your job but if you're staying inside now you're either working from home or lost your job already and on welfare, so what's the difference if other people choose to work their jobs? You can claim to want a lockdown because of protecting others - but the people who will get infected by going out are the ones you claim are selfish anyway. </p>
<p>There are exceptions - like dependents (i.e. children) or those in care. But children are barely affected and have much less chance of dying from covid than from injuries or other diseases; and even in the most extreme lockdowns the virus still ripped through aged care, usually accounting for a great number of the overall deaths and a big questionmark over what the point of the lockdowns were in the first place if they didn't even protect nursing homes.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. It baffles me that people seem to think they weren‚Äôt taking ‚Äúrisk‚Äù by living before 2020... and I use risk in the loosest sense of the word, an average of 0.26% IFR with all the sketchy death allocations and testing underrepresenting those who‚Äôve had it..</p>

        <p>To add to that, people who are staying at home because of health concerns are going to have to do so longer because of these restrictions. The people going out and about are probably going to get it at some point. All restrictions do is make that process take much longer. This will end when people who are active get it, recover, and develop immunity. We're not still dealing with coronavirus because of people who went to a party; we're still dealing with it because the government has decided to enact policies that make everyone miserable that prolong the period of that misery.</p>

        <p>100% agree with this. I think a lot of the people wanting restrictions at this point are the ones who the restrictions benefit, virus or no virus. They don‚Äôt like crowds, they have no interest in going to concerts and stuff, they don‚Äôt want to commute every day and see their coworkers. They‚Äôre very introverted and don‚Äôt like interacting with people (except on the internet). They‚Äôre not quite hermits, they still want to go food shopping and out for walks etc., so they want the restrictions to stay so they can continue living the lives they want to live without as many people around, just how they like it. They don‚Äôt care that other people are deeply unhappy with this new life. They got their utopia. And they have the cheek to say <em>we‚Äôre</em> selfish.</p>

        <p>I don't really get this, though, because that almost completely describes me.  I don't care much for in-person social interaction, I don't like crowded places, I don't go to concerts or sporting games, and I would gladly work from home if I could.  </p>
<p>But those are my preferences, my choices.  I would never expect everyone to be like me, let alone attempt to force my lifestyle on other people.  I would never codify introversion into law.  It's absurd and inhumane.</p>

        <p>What youre missing is that these people act like being introverted is their entire personality. Theyre the people writing on Twitter about how they have no friends except their cat and a bottle of wine. Theyre the people with the tshirt that says "I only like like 3 people" or whatever stupid phrase is popular. Theyre not content with just being, they have to broadcast it to the world in this weird, almost arrogant way.</p>
<p>Im also very introverted but apparently I do more in public than these people. Unless theyre lying, and I suspect most people are, about how often they leave the house.</p>

        <p>Why are you blaming the rest of the ants in the colony when the Elite are the ones that are controlling this situation for all of us? Blame your local state representative, blame inept leadership, and blame the people with power who forced you to live this new life through mandates/orders. I never understood why the poor, broke pawns always cut each others throats while Big daddy in charge is laughing at you. Your anger is misguided. The government shut down our economy, the government issued mandates, the government closed businesses and put people out of work. Don't be mad at the average joe, like yourself, that is also trying to weather this bullshit storm.</p>

        <p>I am very angry at the government but the people supporting and encouraging the policies are not blameless! We‚Äôre not ants, we are people with moral compasses and brains. People should be using them. If nobody listened to the government, the government would be powerless. So yes, all this is the government‚Äôs fault but we could easily have solved this and we haven‚Äôt, and that is the failure of the people. I am angry at the people for that failure.</p>

        <p>You act as if you were "woke" your whole life. Everyday people are being force fed information through the media. This country invokes and creates bias through the politicization of everyday acts. You are mad at people who go about their day doing the best with what little has been given to them. When you know better you do better. They don't know better and the ignorance of the masses has been preplanned. Everyone is lost. Meanwhile you have been living in a society that has force fed you lies about mattering more than you really do. We are not humans to them we are capital stock. Unless you have power you will just live your life at the whim of those in charge because at any moment everything we worked hard for can be ruined in a moments notice. Look at how they completely decimated our livelihoods now. The people that are afraid to question things are retail workers who are behind on rent, poor people that are getting ready to be evicted, and old people that watch the news that tells them they are all going to die. They have essentially been "starved" and are to weak to fight back. I can't be upset with my fellow crumbers because every piece of information we consume has an agenda. If you want change then get as many people to wake up and fight for it. Downing others because they have fallen for the schtick isn't helping.</p>

        <p>I don't agree with this at all.  </p>
<p>I think it's simple cult mentality. The mask cultists are <em>extroverts</em> who love showing off their masks, love begging for attention on social media, and love being showered with praise and adoration from other Correct Thinkers. Hell, the only thing they love more than all that is destroying people for being outside the cult.</p>

        <p>We have always been at risk for lots of things.  You could catch the flu at work, and that could be the one flu that does the job and kills you.  After all, the vaccine doesn't cover every possible strain.  Or, you know, you could die in a car wreck on the way in, or the way home, or whatever.  You could be the victim of a carjacking, mugging, drive-by, whatever.</p>

        <p>What do your results mean? If you test positive A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.

<p>The most common test for covid-19 is PCR (using a swab) which has around 95-100% accuracy.</p>

        <p>The types of people who are into lockdowns absolutely disgust me. Just their personalities and who they are. I like to spend lots of time outdoors. I like to go to the beach, go in the mountains and shoot, stuff like that. Even if I don‚Äôt go anywhere one weekend, just being outside in my backyard is better than being inside all day. It‚Äôs really beneficial for mental and physical health.</p>
<p>These lockdown freaks aren‚Äôt like that at all. They stay in their houses 24/7, act like that‚Äôs the cool thing to do, and shame everyone else for wanting to have fun after months in isolation. Before covid, these assholes never went outside. They were too busy virtue signaling on Twitter to just take a fucking break and go on a walk.</p>

        <p>Please stop making generalizations.  I have been socially isolating since March bc myself and my parents are high risk.  That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt go outside on walks, hikes, runs, etc.  I refrain from going out to eat and only go into enclosed public spaces when necessary (while wearing a mask).  I miss living my normal life.  Not seeing friends for 5 months is not easy.  Before this I never stayed inside.  I‚Äôm a college athlete (tennis) and would frequently play against other college players in my area, and tournaments.  Now, I hit against a wall alone at a high school.  The situation sucks, but make no mistake if we all had been responsible under decisive leadership we would be in a much better situation right now.  The longer we stay divided the worse this will get.</p>
<p>Edit: just bc you disagree doesn‚Äôt mean you have to downvote. I‚Äôm not coming into your think tank and insulting you guys. I‚Äôm offering a different perspective in a mannered form. Frankly, I don‚Äôt agree with a single thing that I‚Äôve seen in this sub. However, it is important to try and understand those who have differing opinions from your own.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs important to keep in mind Sweden has a much smaller population. I could just as easily say we could be like New Zealand by now and not suffer the countless lives that would have been lost by herd immunity. Also please remember Fauci has been a public servant for decades and an integral part of many presidential administrations. He is a reputable person.</p>

        <p>But then what? Ignoring the fact there was no way the US was ever going to eradicate it, what would happen if they did? Sealed off from the world for 3 years? What if there wasn't a vaccine? Sealed off from the world forever? NZ is going to have to make a decision about whether or not to open borders. They might get very lucky and get a 100% faultless vaccine before having to make that decision, but it's unlikely.</p>

        <p>If we were all working together to protect each other's health, then everyone working in fast food or at candy factories should quit on the spot. Obesity kills. They are cogs in a terrible machine that kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world every year. Same for tobacco farmers and alcohol makers. They need to find another way to make a living because their products are bad for people's health. It really bites that you and your family are at an elevated risk for catching literally any respiratory virus (did you take precautions like this for influenza?), but it is not fair for you to ask everyone else to stop living their lives. That will not stop this virus, and it will only cause economic and psychological damage to everyone else. You have to take responsibility for yourselves as you have been doing.</p>

        <p>As an individual against the new normal, I think you should mention the other side's argument so you don't make us pro-normality peeps look like fools. We already look foolish enough.</p>
<p>The anti-normality crowd's argument is that "covidiots" are contracting the disease at eViL sOcIaL gAtHeRiNgS, then spreading it through Walmarts (where non-covidiots go). However, my argument is that coronaphobes should only shop around once a month (which you'd think would be what the coronaphobes want to do, but isn't for some reason). </p>
<p>Remember back in mid-March when everyone was talking about stocking up on items? What happened to that? Why are people now encouraged to "essentially shop" whenever they want? If coronaphobes would just only shop once a month, shutting down non-essential businesses would be pointless because covidiots would pretty much only be spreading the coronavirus to other covidiots, so them getting infected with the virus would only be their own faults. </p>
<p>And what are the odds of a coronaphobe getting infected with COVID-19 the ONE TIME he/she goes to Walmart?</p>

        <p>Oh so now you‚Äôre assuming you know how I live? Again, imagining things? Serieusly, get a doctor</p>
<p>I am not demanding lockdowns to continue, again, that‚Äôs your imagination. If everyone follows precautions the spread of the virus will be disturbed and there won‚Äôt be another lockdown, by not using precautions you are allowing the virus to spread and therefore the possibility of another lockdown. Yes, another lockdown would be the fault of people like you, it‚Äôs simple logic, think about it</p>
<p>Lockdowns are decided by the government and are used when there are too many infections, people that do not take precautions are a reason for more infections and therefore a reason for another lockdown</p>
<p>The virus causes millions of people to lose their jobs wich means you are causing millions of people to lose their jobs because you are supporting that same virus</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not scared of the virus at all, I just care about the health of others and want to go back to normal asap. The fastest way to do that is to wear a mask and socially distance so we can stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and practice social distancing isn‚Äôt as bad as you pretend it to be, you can still breath and still go outside</p>
<p>In your original post you say people who want to be healthy should stay inside and now you say ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt supposed to stay inside‚Äù.. make up your mind</p>
<p>I agree, it‚Äôs 100% not ok to implement rules that end up killing people and yet, that‚Äôs exactly what you are doing by causing the virus to spread further and therefore causing another lockdown. And that‚Äôs after you possibly killed some people cuz ur spreading a deathly virus</p>
<p>Cuz doesn‚Äôt make you look idiotic, many people do use it. Being the reason a deathly virus is spreading however does make you seem idiotic</p>

        <p>So you do whatever you want while those at risk are forced to stay indoors for a year? That‚Äôs selfish when all you have to do is maintain social distance, avoid large groups and wear a mask. That‚Äôs a lot easier than asking someone to not step outside for years as you indicated. New York is a great example of how everyone can live a relatively normal life with mass cooperation.</p>

<p>Trust me, that's not all we are being asked to do. When cases rise here in Australia we are forced under house arrest, arrested in the streets for walking, pulled out of cars after our windows are smashed and can have the police raid our house at any moment.</p>

        <p>Oh, that's great, we won't go outside than, I won't buy food and my boyfriend won't go to his job. Let's look at the consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our gas, water, electricity and internet will be cut off cuz no job is no money to pay the bills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will starve cuz I can't go outside to get food and my bf can't work to earn money to buy said food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will get evicted cuz no job means no money to pay rent</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: if we didn't starve by the time we get evicted we will have to live outside as a result of not going outside cuz we don't want to get sick due to the selfishness of others</p>
<p>Not everyone still lives with their parents ( who probably will get evicted too if they rent and don't go outside due the selfishness of people like you, but you don't think that far ), it's painfully obvious the majority of this sub are kids</p>

        <p>Yep. Live off your savings (or charity, or credit) for a few months or get a job that allows you to work from home.  And get everything delivered while the rest of us keep society functioning <em>and</em> build the herd immunity that will ultimately protect you if and when you decide to emerge from your self-imposed exile.  The illogic of that commenter is stunning: "<em>I</em> can't just stay home for a few months. I'd starve. That's why <em>everyone</em> needs to stay home for a few months so we can <em>all</em> starve. That  way it's more equitable."</p>

        <p>Infections hun, not deaths. Deaths are thankfully getting lower everywhere due to a better understanding of the virus and therefore better medical care. Still doesn't mean we should just let the virus spread, it can still cause permanent damage on your lungs</p>
<p>If we're gonna talk about other places anyway, my country's news site just published an article of new sealand. Because of the more strictly enforcement of the precautions and the closing of their boarders new sealand didn't have new infections in 100 days, people are allowed to live a normal life again there
That's what following the precautions does, it makes sure we can all go back to living a normal life again</p>

        <p>Hmm no they haven't. Current 7-day average is 192, second-lowest since the end of March. Weekly cases for the last 3 weeks (not including last 2 days which has caused the low 7-day average):</p>
<p>July 18-24 - 1448</p>
<p>July 25-31 - 1301</p>
<p>August 1-7 - 1686</p>
<p>And it's New Zealand, not sealand. And if countries like America or others in Europe tried to eradicate the virus it would take years of hard lockdown. Not 100 days. NZ barely had any cases to begin with and the vast majority of those were overseas travellers in quarantine.</p>

        <p>The only more affordable housing we can get is no housing at all wich will again result in us living outside where we can get sick due to selfish people like yourself. Where do you see me asking millions of people to go on welfare, rely on charity and move to more affordable housing? I didn‚Äôt bring this pandemic into the world, are you delusional?</p>
<p>If Covid didn‚Äôt temporarily shut your job down you will get no compensation if you don‚Äôt go to work so if you can‚Äôt work from home you will have to go outside. And if we are supposed to stay inside like you say we are, why are you not staying inside?</p>
<p>Why are you saying people that don‚Äôt want to get sick should stay inside so sellfish people can go outside? Now, that‚Äôs hypocricy</p>
<p>How hypocrit is it to call someone a hypocrite for giving you facts while you‚Äôre being a hypocrite yourself?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not my fault people are losing their jobs due to covid but they are ( or are supposed to be ) compensated financially, my bf will not get compensated if he just decides to stop working. How are you calling me sellfish because I still get to go to work while others can‚Äôt ( wich isn‚Äôt even my fault )? And are you seeing things that aren‚Äôt there? Do you need a doctor? I never said I still get to go to work, I‚Äôm a SAHM, why is your dilusional brain imagining things?</p>
<p>All I‚Äôm asking is to wear a mask and to socially distance to protect yourself and others, wich every sane person is already doing anyway. How did you get out of that simple request that everyone can easily follow to not be a danger to others that it‚Äôs my fault people are losing their jobs and I‚Äôm asking them to go on wellfare? The latter is what you‚Äôre asking of me and others that don‚Äôt want to get sick cuz of sellfish people like you so who‚Äôs the hypocrite here?</p>
<p>Asking people to use their brain is not equal to making them lose their jobs and go on wellfare. Again, I didn‚Äôt bring this pandemic into the world but other than you I am using my brain and therefore encouraging people to do what‚Äôs necessary to keep themselves and others healthy</p>
<p>Cuz is short for because in case you haven‚Äôt learned that yet, many people use it</p>

        <p>Yeah I very much doubt you are living in a one room apartment in a cheap area. You are asking millions by demanding lockdowns continue! It has caused millions of people to lose their jobs and their income and rely on welfare and charity to get by! Stop being so god damned thick. The pandemic didn't do it, people fucking did. </p>
<p>You aren't supposed to stay inside, I don't give a shit what you do. But don't go demanding everyone else do exactly what you want them to do, they aren't responsible for your health. If you are that damned scared of the virus that you demand businesses close and call others selfish for not wearing masks or seeing their friends or opening their bar then no, you stay the fuck inside and let other people live their lives. </p>
<p>I'm not being hypocritical at all. I'm saying people should live their lives as they wish. It's other people who are demanding people live according to their demands who are selfish. </p>
<p>You are selfish because you are supporting the conditions that cause people to lose their jobs when they didn't need to. If you are so concerned then you stay home, instead of forcing others to. </p>
<p>I'm not talking about people merely wearing masks or distancing, I'm talking about people who want lockdowns and frickin' house arrest like what is happening in Australia right now. You took what you wanted out of it because you decided to see it as a personal attack on you, which it wasn't. That said, I don't have to wear a mask because you want me to. That's your choice. You can still go outside, it's only your own fear and delusional beliefs holding you back. </p>
<p>And I'm encouraging you to keep yourself healthy and let other people do what's best for them. If I wanted to I could demand alcohol be banned, unhealthy food be banned, driving have much higher restrictions etc so people would be healthier, but I don't. Neither do I demand lockdowns or closing businesses or schools because I know for a lot of people these restrictions cause much greater damage to both their health and livelihoods than the virus ever will, including outright killing people from missed medical treatments and mental health issues. It's 100% not okay to implement rules that end up killing one group of people so a bunch of scared morons can stay safe from a separate threat. </p>
<p>Yeah I know what 'cuz' means, and no, not many people use it, because it makes them look idiotic.</p>

        <p>Oh so now you‚Äôre assuming you know how I live? Again, imagining things? Serieusly, get a doctor</p>
<p>I am not demanding lockdowns to continue, again, that‚Äôs your imagination. If everyone follows precautions the spread of the virus will be disturbed and there won‚Äôt be another lockdown, by not using precautions you are allowing the virus to spread and therefore the possibility of another lockdown. Yes, another lockdown would be the fault of people like you, it‚Äôs simple logic, think about it</p>
<p>Lockdowns are decided by the government and are used when there are too many infections, people that do not take precautions are a reason for more infections and therefore a reason for another lockdown</p>
<p>The virus causes millions of people to lose their jobs wich means you are causing millions of people to lose their jobs because you are supporting that same virus</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not scared of the virus at all, I just care about the health of others and want to go back to normal asap. The fastest way to do that is to wear a mask and socially distance so we can stop the spread of the virus. Wearing a mask and practice social distancing isn‚Äôt as bad as you pretend it to be, you can still breath and still go outside</p>
<p>In your original post you say people who want to be healthy should stay inside and now you say ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt supposed to stay inside‚Äù.. make up your mind</p>
<p>I agree, it‚Äôs 100% not ok to implement rules that end up killing people and yet, that‚Äôs exactly what you are doing by causing the virus to spread further and therefore causing another lockdown. And that‚Äôs after you possibly killed some people cuz ur spreading a deathly virus</p>
<p>Cuz doesn‚Äôt make you look idiotic, many people do use it. Being the reason a deathly virus is spreading however does make you seem idiotic. I literally found this sub cuz people are laughing about how dumb anti maskers are</p>

        <p>You're pulling that shit out of your ass. No one was screeching about wearing a mask for the first 5 months of the "pandemic" now all of a sudden it's necessary. People die of a whole bunch of shit all the time. You're not going to prevent death. How many people have you killed in the past by spreading a cold or a flu? You never thought it would be necessary to wear a mask before. You didn't come to the mask conclusion by yourself, or by any form of critical thought. You were <em>told</em> to do it, and you bought it. As I said, it isn't my responsibility to pander to your irrational fear or the fear of others. If others are concerned about their health, they can seal themselves in a bubble and hide away. That is their responsibility. Asking the entirety of society to change the way they live their<em>normal</em> lives for the minority who are irrationally scared is not only selfish but an absurd request.</p>

        <p>By now it has been proven that masks do work and here‚Äôs <a href="https://youtu.be/0Tp0zB904Mc">how well they work.</a></p>
<p>We can‚Äôt prevent every reason for people to die but we can prevent the spread of this deadly virus and therefore prevent deaths caused by that virus while reducing the number of infections wich in turn will make a normal life possible again. Covid will probably always be there and as long as there isn‚Äôt a vaccin we‚Äôre gonna have precautions every time the number of infections go up again.</p>
<p>But would you rather live a normal life when the number of infections are low and live with precautions for a month or 2 when they are high till they get low again? Or do you want to live with precautions till there is a vaccin without normal life in between cuz people keep enforcing the spread of the virus?</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a vaccin for the flu wich results in way less deaths and isn‚Äôt comparable with covid because of that</p>

        <p>Less than 50% of Americans get a flu vaccine, and vaccines are roughly about 50% effective. Still, the flu caused half a million hospitalizations and 35,000 deaths in the US alone during the 2018-2019 flu season. That's only one year, and not even a bad flu season. So you managed to completely avoid my question because it shows your logical inconsistency. You never wore a mask ever before in your life, and here you are grandstanding about "caring about the health of others." Please fuck off with that virtue signaling garbage. I'll live my life normally <em>now,</em> because I don't answer to you, or any government official about my right to live a normal human existence. Again, it is not my responsibility to pander to your fear or the irrational fear of others. I'm not going to repeat myself again. Your comment shows just how insane y'all are. In March it was "2 weeks to flatten the curve" and here we are almost <em>6 months later</em> and you're still talking about doing this, that, and then other thing so that people stop getting sick at all. It's absurdity. The fact is this virus was <em>not nearly</em> as bad as we were told it would be, hospitals were <em>not nearly</em> as impacted as we were told they would be, and yet restrictions on the freedoms of human existence continue to get tighter.</p>

        <p>The point is that there is a vaccin, people can get the vaccin if they want to be protected. If more than 50% of Americans are too stupid to get the vaccin or don't care if they get the flu that's on them but I am damn sure I'm not making any American sick. The difference in Covid is that there is no vaccin yet, people can not choose to get the vaccin and be protected other than taking the precautions we have now.</p>
<p>I'd like to see the article with those numbers, to compare them with Covid even tho the numbers of Covid are only based on a half year while your numbers on the flu are based on a whole year</p>

        <p>People can stay home if they want to be protected. And now all of a sudden you "don't care if people get the flu that's on them?" Nice, so not only are you inconsistent and a hypocrite, but you've managed to express the exact same sentiment I share for covid. And you're "damn sure" you're not making anyone sick? Yet you're sure anyone not wearing a mask is making people sick? How's that work?</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the flu numbers look the shit up yourself. I'm not your daddy. And if your only criteria for "caring about people" is the <em>amount</em> of people being affected, then again that shows your hypocrisy and only exposes your virtue signaling for what it really is.</p>

<p>I already explained why staying home isn't possible for some people in my original comment</p>
<p>I said I'm damn sure I'm not making any American sick, how does that work? By not living anywhere near America</p>
<p>So you can't find an article that shows those numbers, can't say I'm surprised</p>
<p>Of course I care about people dying from the flu but they can get a vaccin so I care more about the 50% where the vaccin didn't work ( want an article on that too unless you made that number up just like the other numbers )</p>
<p>Covid is worse, there are more infections and deaths because there isn't a vaccin yet so the only protection we have are the precautions. While with the flu we do have a vaccin that protects us</p>

<p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">Cases of corona in US 5,191,762 and still going up, with 165K deaths at the moment ( more deaths than the flu )</a></p>
<p>Your numbers on the flu ( except for the effectiveness of the vaccin ) are correct, so far there are less cases of covid but there are well over 100K more deaths by covid than by the flu. We can come to the conclusion that covid is far more deathly, and therefore worse, than the flu</p>

        <p>I literally just posted a link with the adjusted VE% directly from the CDC LOL. The adjusted VE across all age groups for influenza A and B was 29%. Even if it was 45%, I was being extremely generous previously when I said 50%. That's the best part! You asked for a source after claiming I pulled numbers out of my ass, and now you have multiple. Stfu!</p>
<p>Covid deaths are a bunch of bullshit inflated numbers which include "presumed" cases which by the CDC definition are cases which are not lab confirmed.</p>
<p>I don't even know what you're arguing at this point. Your only argument seems to be "so what tens of thousands of people die from the flu yearly? More die from covid!" Which hardly shows that you "care for the health of others" seeing as you have personally contributed to the spread of deadly viruses previously but seem to not care or at the very least admit your hypocrisy. </p>
<p>IFR for covid is 0.01% adjusted across all age groups, extremely similar to the flu, and has a 99.8%+ recovery rate for individuals younger than 80.</p>

        <p>I'm only saying covid is worse than the flu and there is no vaccin, that you do not take precautions shows that you do not care at all about yourself and others</p>
<p>Yes, it's presumed but the actual number isn't that far off, only deaths of people that had symptoms of covid or actually tested positive when they were still alive are counted as deaths by covid</p>
<p>Deaths of car crashes, cancer etc. aren't counted as deaths by covid like anti maskers like to pretend</p>

I also want to mention that I doubt that the really old articles are about the masks we have today</p>
<p>I already provided a link to a YouTube video by a doctor explaining how well masks work for covid, go watch that if you're open minded enough.</p>

        <p>No doubt. It's <em>extremely</em> expensive to ask people to self-isolate. Of course, it's infinitely <em>less</em> expensive to ask vulnerable people and their caregivers to self-isolate for a few months than it is to ask <em>everyone</em> to do so.</p>

        <p>I don't see how.  </p>
<p>From your original comment:</p>
<p>&rt;You don't really account for those who are very vulnerable who require care at home, from a live-in carer or daily visiting carer -</p>
<p>First of all, that's not true. It seems to me that such individuals were addressed by OP's final paragraph:</p>
<p>&rt;There are exceptions - like dependents (i.e. children) or those in care. But children are barely affected and have much less chance of dying from covid than from injuries or other diseases; and even in the most extreme lockdowns the virus still ripped through aged care, usually accounting for a great number of the overall deaths and a big questionmark over what the point of the lockdowns were in the first place if they didn't even protect nursing homes.</p>
<p>You also wrote:</p>
<p>&rt;the carers will be at greater risk of catching it if all restrictions are lifted </p>
<p>That's not necessarily true. It should be pretty apparent that all of these restrictions are incapable of <em>stopping</em> the spread. They don't even appear to be terribly effective at slowing the spread.  But to the extent they are slowing the spread, that just delays the arrival of herd immunity and extends the length of time that the truly vulnerable need to remain paranoid and locked down.  </p>
<p>In reply to your argument that vulnerable individuals  requiring live-in care or daily visiting care couldn't effectively self-isolate, I noted that they actually <em>could</em> by <em>paying their carer to self-isolate</em>.  You correctly noted that not everyone could afford that.  And that's true. Just not like not everyone can afford the restrictions that are destroying so many lives and livelihoods. That's why in a free society, individuals should be the ones weighing the costs and benefits of various mitigation measures for themselves and deciding what balance they're comfortable with.  "But some people would prefer a balance they can't actually afford!" Well, yeah... such is life. I'd prefer a ski chalet in the Swiss Alps for my vacations, but I've had to settle for a timeshare in Reno because that's more in line with my budget.</p>

        <p>People who require live-in care or daily visiting care would seem to fall under the category of ‚Äúin care‚Äù mentioned by OP, although OP discussed that category in connection with the specific example of nursing home residents.

<p>Possibly. I speak the King's English, but I realize that not everyone does. But regardless, even if the term "in care" wouldn't <em>literally</em> encompass people living in their own homes who require daily or live-in care, those are <em>obviously</em> individuals in a closely analogous situation to the two OP mentioned (i.e., children and people in nursing homes). The point is that they're individuals who are not fully independent / they rely on others for care, which is why OP described them as "exceptions" to his argument.</p>
<p>&rt;And if you want to try to understand the point I'm making, you could read my entire original post again, paying particular attention to the last bit.</p>
<p>I assume that's a reference to "but it's not fair to blame the innocent victims who will surely die." Right. No one suggested otherwise, including OP who specifically called out people who aren't able to live fully independently as "exceptions" to the point he was making. To add to your point, we also shouldn't blame the innocent people who will surely die as a result of lockdowns.</p>
