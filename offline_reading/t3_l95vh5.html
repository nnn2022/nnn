    <strong>How you can explain to people that asymptomatic viral spread is a myth, not that they will listen or apply deductive reasoning.</strong>
    <p><p>I am tired. So tired of hearing everyone from the media to pseudo-scientific article writers claim that asymptomatic spreading covid-19 is a thing. Pre-symptomatic and post infection spread can happen very, very rarely, but overall, not a thing. </p>
<p>Here’s why. </p>
<p>The quick and dirty on viruses is that they enter cells through a mode of transmission (think of it as a car) these “cars” can range from droplets from the nose and throat, to semen, blood, vomit, feces, etc. One universal truth is that human to human spread needs fluid, they cannot transmit without one. When viruses dry out, they die. </p>
<p>A viruses sole purpose is to survive. It survives and propagates by spreading to a host. The host’s body responds by trying to kill the virus. It does this through inflammation and fever, which causes, headaches, tiredness, body aches, cough, runny nose, sore throat, etc. These symptoms also have another purpose, they help the virus gain more “cars” for transmission. That’s right, symptoms are a feature for the virus. The more you cough, the more your nose runs, the more you sneeze, the better the viruses chances of spreading and surviving are.</p>
<p>Viruses will infect a host, get a foothold and begin shedding to increase chances of survival. There are different scientific papers that posit SARS-CoV-2 begins to shed immediately.  This doesn’t make sense from what we know of viruses in terms of R0 , and it doesn’t make sense from what we know of the progression of how they behave. It takes energy for a virus to shed, it doesn’t make sense from an evolutionary standpoint to begin shedding immediately. Viruses lack the ability to synthesize and build genetic material by themselves, they rely on energy from the host’s cells. If I hear one more person say, “Well it’s a novel virus,” I’m gonna lose it. It’s not from outer space, it still operates within the boundaries of what we know about coronaviruses and viruses in general. Natural selection favors viruses that are less deadly. </p>
<p>Sometimes people will try to sound smart and say shit like, “What about Typhoid Mary and people that contract HIV?” First off, Typhoid fever is caused by a Salmonella bacteria, and she gave it to people because she didn’t wash her fucking hands. Also, people who contract HIV develop flu like symptoms soon after; fever, aches, headache, rash, they just don’t associate them with an HIV infection. </p>
<p>So one more time for the fucking idiots talking about how covid can spread from people without symptoms, IF YOU DO NOT HAVE INFECTIOUS FLUIDS FOR THE VIRUS TO TRANSMIT IN, IT CANNOT DO SO. Meaning, if you aren’t coughing, have a runny nose, have a fever, feel like shit, etc. the virus is NOT shedding and you cannot infect people. Unless by some hapless stroke of bad luck you are one of those people that spit when they talk, calm down and wash your fucking hands.</p>

<p>TLDR; No cough, no snot, no fever - no way to transmit covid.</p></p>

        <p>Here’s also an unintended consequence from this overreaction to coronavirus. And there’s a good chance it is intended. In the past, when I have felt like shit, I stay home for a day or two, maybe 3, and heal. Now, if I wake up feeling like shit, I hide it and power through because if I even hint at not feeling well, my boss and everyone around me will insist it’s Covid and not want me to come back to work until I get tested. And fuck them, I’m not getting tested. So it’s lie and power through for me. Which I realize is potentially spreading whatever I have to coworkers. We also tell our kids to avoid going to the nurse and to power through unless it’s just unbearable.</p>

        <p>Used to be a kid pukes and people would go, "eh, kids do that."</p>
<p>Now they want to isolate and poke and prod the kid when kids are just gross and always pass around diseases.</p>
<p>I'm thoroughly convinced that the real threat will be massive numbers of kids that have never had chicken pox. Adult onset chicken pox kills adults every year. No infection means no immunity.</p>

        <p>They simply won't listen. Their sense of their own importance, which is caught up with the desire to make this "crisis" seem existentially meaningful in the deepest way possible, is too great. I have tried to discuss all of these things with them, and have sent them the Wuhan study and the Danish mask study (proving, beyond a doubt, the uselessness of masks). They are deeply invested in the doom. They will not hear you.</p>
<p>At this point I don't know what to do. The twenty-four-hour news cycle, which preaches the insanity, and social media, which is everywhere and at all times, are simply too powerful for the still, lone voice of reason to be heard.</p>

        <p>its funny how well i have learned these baseball card stats too.  I’m well versed in that one as well.  .7% asympto attack rate for within household compared to 30 for sympto within household.  that 30 is interesting also because thats a lot of contact and still not leaping off and ebola infecting people the way these spacesuit wearing chodemuffins are acting</p>

        <p>The 30% is also extremely interesting, and that might be due to the PCR tests giving false positives.  </p>
<p>Or it must spread in a very different way. (Via our asses).</p>

        <p>exactly.  the idea that its spread through drops and aerosols is still theoretical in a way.  i have heard fecal proteins mentioned as an unspoken potential other vector since summer.  im amazed how many people 100%, not 98% or 80%, 100 percent trust media and podium clowns, aka politicians.</p>

        <p>I dont think it is fecal. But it is certainly something that needs to be tested.   </p>
<p>A saw some reports that claimed that the virus could last 16 days on a surface. And they linked it to the lab origin. Normal viruses last maybe a few hours, so this is an immense long time.  </p>
<p>Such a long time may even cause infections via mail delivered items from china.</p>

        <p>I see your point and have argued about it many times. It is not impossible to transmit the virus before you have felt the symptoms, but it is <strong>much less likely</strong> to do so than after you have a raging infection.</p>
<p>The same applies to the transmission outdoors (shown to be only 5% of that indoors, other factors equal), and to protection from the most common unprofessional equipment (decreasing spread only partially).</p>
<p>In the end of the day, what this all boils down to is how much any of the associated measures would affect the reproductive number R0. If their impact is negligible, then we should consider any negative impact of the measures a lot more seriously.</p>

        <p>It’s definitely not impossible to transmit during the pre-symptomatic phase, it is just highly unlikely. You would need a lot of body fluids transmitted to have the probability that one of the virions finds the host. </p>
<p>Basically unless you are making out, or sharing food or drink with a pre-symptomatic person, you won’t transmit the virus.</p>

        <p>It depends on the level of infection of the host and the mode of transmission of the virus. For example with covid, the virus lives and replicates in the upper respiratory tract, so the mucous membranes of the nose, throat and mouth. If you are heavily infected, and having symptoms, then yes, you could possibly transmit the virus with normal respiratory moisture. It’s not as likely because normal breath moisture doesn’t contain as much body fluid as say, droplets from a cough or sneeze.</p>

This is what I hear from people when I try to explain that you really need to be sick (like with symptoms and it is all though your body) for you to have any likelihood of infecting anyone. If you are not symptomatic you have a low viral load, your body is fighting and killing it naturally, so the viral shedding is very very low. I</p>

        <p>Anyone of you tested positive yet? Because if you haven’t or do not know of cases where this actually is happening - then don’t stress your pretty brains over proving medical industry wrong. Its better err on the side of caution then make everyone sick. I have tested positive and I am full blown sick. I caught it from work and our patient zero in the office exhibited zero symptoms! But his gf got full blown symptoms after everyone was notified to be tested. What you need to understand is everyone’s level of illness is diff. Some feel if it more and some don’t feel shit given the severity of the illness. I have friends who only had digestive systems and tested positive. If you ask them? they will tell you it was the tacos they ate. No two flu cases are the same for the same person, sometimes you are realllly sick and everything hurts - other times it just a mild case. Viruses can be seen as your nagging family members. Some visits are from hell, other times you might get along fine with little discomfort.</p>

        <p>Mucus, coughing, sneezing, spitting, and fever are not the only way to spread diseases. Coughing, sneezing, and spitting are not the only way to spread respiratory droplets. Normal speaking (even if you don’t spit) creates an aerosol that can contain virions even breathing can release respiratory droplets and aerosols. You can infect someone while sneezing, coughing, secreting mucus or having a fever like you mention, but you can also infect people by talking normally or just breathing.</p>

        <p>thats what has been built up as a core tenet of pro masking philosophy, but a) are the virii built up enough to be shedding and b) even household attack/spread is only 30% for fully symptomatic people which means through the period of max viral shedding, coughing, sneezing, oozing fluids, and you compare that with expelling mostly breath as people breath without symptoms, that is just trading too much life to a sliver of potential safety.  at that point you are a fucking cuck with no love for your own life if you are willing to inhibit and treat breathing as a priv and not a right, to improve odds in the tenth or hundredth of a percent.  being able to breathe, live normally, and walk around has been converted from a right into a privilege as we speak, by fear parroting people like you.</p>

        <p>In theory yes, in practice no. Because the virions need moisture to survive outside of the host. You would also need to be in the shedding phase of the viral infection for this to happen, which would mean you would be sick, and if you are sick, why would you be interacting with others? </p>
<p>A pre-symptomatic person, just talking normally is not going to transmit enough viral load to infect a host.</p>
