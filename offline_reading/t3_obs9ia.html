    <strong>Should I be honest about my vaccine status?</strong>
    <p><p>I support the right of anyone to chose to be vaccinated, or not, you know, whatever floats your boat. I don't think its a great idea given my past experience, but hey, you do you.</p>
<p>But I am jumping through hoops to avoid any vaccine and especially the covid vaccine, because several years ago I had a vaccine reaction that hospitalized me and left me chronically ill. I have struggled for years to get back to feeling well enough to work full time and do normal activities. </p>
<p>I'm angry and very scared of being cooerced or forced into the vaxx, I'm terrified that these vaccine maniacs feel entitled to playing Russian roulette WITH MY HEALTH. Several doctors have tried to push the vax on me despite that I told them I have been seriously ill from a vaccine reaction. Their excuse is always, well you havent gotten ill from THIS vaccine...</p>
<p>I'm getting tired of resisting and trying to explain to people why I'm not getting vaccinated, their brains are like cork, they can't even conceptualize what its like to fear getting critically and permanently ill from a vaccine, they brush off my experience like its nothing and keep talking about all the vaccines I could get that are not the one I got sick from, or doubt my experience like, "are you sure it was from the vaccine? Because it was probably just something else."</p>
<p>So I wonder, should I keep standing my ground, or when people ask should I be like, yeah, sure I've had a covid vaccine, just to get them to lay off and shut up about their stupid vaxx-pseudoreligion?</p></p>

        <p>Thats a tough one. I'd say depending on the situation and who it is thats asking, be strategic. If it's a situation that doesn't affect your life overall the be honest. If its work related, then that's what it gets tough if they ask for proof. </p>
<p>And the end of the day, this is YOUR life. No one can make you do anything as much as they try. Continue standing on your feet.</p>

        <p>Do what you think is the right thing to do for you. If you think you can handle getting the same reaction over and over again, keep doing what you're doing now. If you think telling them you <em>did</em> get the vaccine because it saves you energy and stress, you should definitely do that. It's not worth damaging your own (mental) health because these people refuse to listen to you, that's their problem. </p>
<p>Personally, I try to avoid having to mention it at all costs (which isn't difficult because I barely talk to anyone lol). If it does get brought up I try to be as vague as possible, playing up the part where I'm scared because of my allergies, because I hate confrontations and outright lying doesn't feel right to me. It's a kind of middle ground that feels the most comfortable to me. I hope you can find something that works for you, OP! Take care :)</p>

        <p>I would say you have a very valid reason for not taking the vaccine even for people that are normally pro-vax.<br>
I can understand if at some point you play along. 
I myself just say: no, I dont want the vax. 
I dont easily lie so I rather just say the truth. I will only explain if they ask. 
If there is a discussion I simply say: well, we will see in  the long run who made the best choice.</p>

        <p>Integrity is like virginity, you only lose it once. </p>
<p>If someone asks me about the vaccine, I don't focus on spilling red pills because most people have been indoctrinated. </p>
<p>I say this "You know, I think I'm just going to wait it out. There's a lot of misinformation on both sides and somewhere between the two extremes is truth" </p>
<p>Most of the time people will agree and 99% of people are harmless, just a little misdirected from the media. </p>
<p>Keep a cool head and just communicate. </p>
<p>I'm going for an interview today and on the job description it reads "Proof of Covid vaccination required", it's only a small company so I'm sure with a cqlm, clear head and some logic bombs, I'll land the job with no proof needed.</p>

        <p>Was it transverse myelitis that you got from a vaccine? If so the chances are practically nothing for getting it again from another vaccine. Even the same one that gave you the disease. I had tm from MMR vaccine. Got the covid jab just fine. And tetanus. One of the hepatitis shots and 1 other that I can not remember.</p>
