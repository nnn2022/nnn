    <strong>"It's just a piece of fabric"</strong>
    <p><p>Finding this sub last September was like a breath of fresh air for me - I live in a very liberal city and found myself afraid to discuss my true feelings about the restrictions for fear of being labeled hateful, lacking compassion, a grandma killer, etc. As the months went on and “two weeks to slow the spread” became a distant memory, there was at least some room to debate the lockdowns as most can at least recognize the economic costs associated with shutting down society. There was also some room to push back against social distancing, as again, most can recognize that humans need some degree of in-person social interaction. </p>
<p>However, the one restriction that everyone seemed to just unquestionably accept were the mask mandates. The line I often saw, both in-person and online, was "It's just a piece of fabric - it's not a big deal." As if to say "There aren't any downsides to wearing a mask, but a potential upside; therefore, we should all mask up." But that's not true, is it?</p>
<p>There are several downsides - the obvious one is that it does make breathing more difficult. Masks don’t completely impair your ability to breathe, no, but they do unquestionably make it more difficult.  I also find the masks uncomfortable - I don’t like the feeling of a piece of fabric on my face. They make me feel claustrophobic. They make me more anxious - I find myself constantly having to pull the mask up off my face in order to take in a deep breath and calm down. </p>
<p>But none of these are the biggest downside of the mask IMO. How did we suddenly just accept, as a society, that we no longer need to see other people’s faces? It’s just so bizarre to me. A huge part of human connection comes from reading facial expressions and then being able to express yourself via sharing your own, something that’s greatly hindered by the inability to see the lower half of each other’s faces. As humans, we’re wired to seek out the faces of other humans - it’s the first thing we look at when interacting with someone. This is why the equivalence of masks to clothes never made any sense. I don’t experience human connection via looking at another person’s legs.</p>
<p>If it truly is “just a piece of fabric” with no downsides, why are television anchors not wearing them on TV? Why do people generally take them off before speaking at a news conference? Why don’t people wear them while chatting over Zoom? Why are actors not wearing them on set? Why aren’t artists wearing them in their music videos? It’s almost like being able to see a person’s face is important. When I speak to someone wearing a mask, I don’t feel as though I’m fully seeing them. There’s a barrier in the way. I want to see you. I want to connect with you fully. And I want you to see me. I hate having to speak to people with a mask on - it feels like I can’t properly express myself. It feels like I’m swimming with a weight on my foot. </p>
<p>My grandfather died from cancer last fall. During the funeral visitation, a time that’s supposed to be about coming together, connecting, and offering emotional support - everyone was just standing around staring at masks rather than human faces. How is this not questioned? How did we all just accept this? At a time when human connection is most important, why must we wear an item which fundamentally hinders that connection?</p>
<p>I’m not someone who thinks masks are useless - I think in certain situations, they make sense. But why are we not allowed to run that cost/benefit analysis in every scenario? Why did we all just accept that suddenly masks must be worn literally everywhere by everyone regardless of the context? Could it be that in certain situations, the costs of the masks outweigh the benefits? Could it be that in certain situations, the masks simply don’t make any sense?</p>
<p>You see this now with people continuing to wear masks after they’ve been fully vaccinated. What are you doing? Seriously. What the hell are you doing? Is there a chance you can still catch the virus and spread it to someone else after vaccination? Yes. However, this probability is tiny. So the benefit of the mask has gone down to almost zero, whereas the costs are still the same - primarily the inability to see your face. Are we waiting for the risk to be literally zero? Is that what we’re waiting for? Because that will literally NEVER happen. Life has risks. It had risks before 2020 too, but at that time, we seemed to understand that life is a series of risk assessments. What happened to that? I’m serious. What happened? I’m genuinely afraid that the mask mandates will never fully go away because people seem so terrified of even the tiniest risk - it’s like we’re waiting on 100% certainty.</p>
<p>I genuinely believe most people who are “anti-mask” would be much more willing to follow the mandates if there was some allowance for this analysis to be done. You require a mask in a nursing home? Okay, sure. You require a mask if you’re symptomatic? Sure - I can understand the logic here. You insist on a mask while you’re outside walking alone in a park? This makes no sense. The risk in that situation is essentially zero. And this makes me LESS likely to comply going forward. Because you’re forcing something on me that is so obviously completely removed from any reasonable assessments of risk. </p>
<p>This is why the "anti-science" rhetoric makes no sense - science can only inform on the risks associated with the virus and the potential reduction of that risk via wearing a mask. Science cannot, however, perform the risk assessment against other factors - there's no agreed upon objective measure here. You have to look at the benefits of lockdowns against the costs of lockdowns. You have to look at the benefits of masks against the costs of masks. Inevitably, people will come to different conclusions. Labeling certain people or groups as "against science" is just so incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>You have to let people make those decisions - you have to allow conversations to be had about the costs. When you shut people down, shame them, call them names, imply they lack a heart - this only makes them less likely to listen going forward. For people who preach so often about compassion, I’ve never seen such vitriol on posts concerning “anti-maskers”. Have you considered they assessed the risks differently from you? You’re allowed to disagree with them; however, insinuating they lack compassion, is itself a demonstration of a lack of compassion. Even in the situation you are correct, and the benefits of the mask outweigh the costs in a particular context, what do you think this public shaming accomplishes? Any behaviors which are altered out of shame breed resentment. This is toxic, and it will destroy us. You don’t want to live in a society that has been molded by shame. </p>
<p>I fear the ramifications of this division will long outlive any lingering effects of the virus. Like we’ll forever be defined by our actions in 2020 and there will be no grey area. It’s a dangerous precedent this past year has set - this complete refusal to engage in any form of risk assessment. The shutdown of conversation. The dismissal and demonization of those who have doubts or disagreements. The acceptable level of risk has been lowered so far - people have been conditioned to view each other as a potential threat. We’re labeled hateful for breathing in public. Safety has become the ultimate virtue which outweighs literally everything else. You think all of this will just magically go away in a few months? The pandemic may end, but this “better safe than sorry” mindset will linger on ensuring that this will happen again. And when it does, I pray it’s after we’ve had enough time to learn the lessons of the first time. But it probably won’t.</p>
<p>I’ve basically become a shut-in over the last few months - not because I’m afraid of catching or spreading the virus, but because I can’t stomach the thought of seeing faceless people everywhere. It makes my heart drop. I live alone; I don’t know a lot of people in the city. The only time I see a human face now is on a screen. Occasionally, I’ll pass by someone outdoors who isn’t wearing a mask and it makes me so happy - just to see another person’s face. I’ve had dreams where I’m inside grocery stores and no one is wearing a mask - it fills me with such a warm feeling. I’m terrified businesses will never lift the mandates. I don’t want to live in that world. I feel so damaged by all this. I’m lonely. I feel completely disconnected from the world. I even find myself starting to view other people as a potential vector of disease rather than a human being. I see large crowds on TV pre-covid and immediately view it as wrong. I go through old photos of birthday parties and wonder why no one is wearing a mask. </p>
<p>This isn’t normal. We aren’t supposed to live like this. Social distancing and masking have very real consequences - and you’re telling me we can’t even have a discussion about it? You’re telling me it’s “just a piece of fabric, so STFU and comply”? No. Don’t shut down conversation like that. Don’t shut down someone else’s experiences and perspectives. Don’t make people feel completely unheard and terrified to express an opinion. Don’t boil complex and nuanced decisions down to “we should always err on the side of saving even one life.” Newsflash - people die. Especially elderly people. That’s part of life. And maturity requires recognizing that death is an ever-present threat hanging over all of us, and although it’s a risk that should be factored into our decisions, it isn’t a risk that ever goes to zero. And it isn’t a risk that cannot be outweighed by other factors. </p>
<p>“Saving lives” is an admirable goal, but it isn’t a goal which exists in a vacuum. There are consequences in the pursuit of that goal - why are we not allowed a discussion about those consequences? Death isn’t some ultimate trump card - it’s just another risk that must be weighed against other factors. This isn’t heartless - it’s simply recognizing a reality. We’ve always done this as a society - weighed the risk of death against the consequences of potentially reducing that risk. Why did this change in 2020? I genuinely find this difficult to understand.</p>
<p>So these are my thoughts - I just needed to write them out. I feel really beat down by all this. I feel like the messaging has largely been “Shut up and comply, and if you don’t, you’re evil and want people to die.” It’s more nuanced than that. My opposition to masks doesn’t stem from lack of compassion, but from the opposite - I want to see people again, fully. I want people to see me. I’m worried that the obstruction of faces and the conditioning to view others as potential vectors of disease will lead to a less compassionate society.</p>
<p>Feel free to drop me a DM if you need a place to vent - I normally just lurk on here, so I get not wanting to post anything publicly. It shouldn’t be scary to talk about our doubts and frustrations - we all have a fundamental need to be heard. On that note, if you read this whole thing, thanks for listening.</p></p>

        <p>The pro-maskers are very effective at sloganeering &amp; name calling. They tell you it’s “only a piece of fabric” and they call you a “science denier”. As you point out, both of those statements are untrue. Masks have always been seen as a sign of danger, not safety, and they cover up facial expressions, one of our main means of communication as humans. In other words they’re very dehumanizing and not just a piece of cloth. To counter this we jokingly say we’re pro-face, but it’s really not a joke and these people are often literally and explicitly anti-face. </p>
<p>They’re also as far from pro-science as can be. Wearing a mask outside or alone in a car is sign of neurosis, not an act of protection. The science wouldn’t back what any of these people are doing, especially the ones who stay inside not talking to anyone and not exercising. They are anti-science &amp; anti-public health </p>
<p>In other words, these people don’t have real arguments so their only tool is to shame you. Maybe anti-lockdown people need to get better at the sort of sloganeering these people use against us. I had someone tell me the other day that <em>I</em> was a Karen for not wearing a mask, to which I naturally pointed out that people who aggressively shame others for not wearing them are probably closer to the definition of Karen. But maybe a better approach than namecalling would be just not wearing the mask, and smiling when you see people to remind them what it’s like to see a person’s smiling face</p>

        <p>I agree 100% with you. </p>
<p>We need to take action NOW. Do not wear a mask unless police are around and fight the antinatural ideas they are trying impose everyday. </p>
<p>There are a lot of people that are hesitant, if they see you walking without a mask they may feel encouraged to take their mask off too. </p>
<p>Ps: do not hold back when someone tries to convince you to give up on your freedoms.</p>

        <p>I have PTSD also and I wear a shield. I cannot wear a mask. I am lucky my job permits shields, but living in Seattle it is hard. I get customers who refuse to deal with me because "I'm not properly covering" and "Fauci says you're wrong" but then I get people who appreciate being able to see my face.</p>

        <p>This is very true. I love your vent. It's exactly how I feel. It's worse in America because of all the "for OTHERS" bs. In Europe it's always been "wear one inside to slow the spread"-- that's it (I'm speaking of Eastern Europe, I know it's really horrible in Austria and other places). But here it's no big deal because no one thinks it's a big deal. No one's afraid they are going to die if they are in a room with someone without.a mask. No one ever would tell someone to put on a mask (aside from someone working in a shop, etc, and most of them wear theirs on their chins too). It IS a big deal, it IS awful, it IS a pain, and it is worse for some people than others. I hate them partially because of the "it's no big deal!" crap. Yes. it is a big deal, and people pretending the sacrifice is nothing makes me determined to do it as little as possible. I know I'm not alone</p>
