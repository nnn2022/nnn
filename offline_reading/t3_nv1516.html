        <p>So my mother in law and husband were having a conversation about the injection. My husband expressed, for the fourth time, that he would not be getting it. She started crying because she “didn’t want her grandkids growing up without dad”. I kid you not. It’s bad enough we were treating a Covid diagnosis as a guaranteed death sentence, but now not getting jabbed is a death sentence??</p>

        <p>A lot of old people couldn't care less about the young dying all they care about is prolonging their miserable lives a while longer while we spend the best years of our life suffering to keep their life support machines ticking along long enough for them to give more terrible advice from their years of crap parenting.   </p>

        <p>Yeah, 100%. The elderly in high positions in politics and business don’t want to give up control yet, and this past year has been an insanely costly attempt to keep the 70+ age bracket alive. So they played off our sense of familial love and terrorized people into obeying in order to delay the generational passing of the baton</p>

        <p>My mother and mother in law are in their 70's, my mother got the vax cause she is scare but has never voiced any concern for me to get it and my mother in law thinks the pandemic is a load of shit and hasn't wore a mask anywhere from the start. It's terrible what this has done to otherwise rational people. I also hear about people telling their parents to get the jab or they'll never see their grand children again which is really sad.</p>

        <p>Hi guys. Just wanted to say I'm glad I found this group. It can be overwhelming reading things on Reddit or Twitter and seeing how many people are brainwashed into embracing a "new normal". It's depressing, really. So it's nice to be reminded that there are other people (you guys) who see through it all. I'm lucky that my close family also shares my views and I haven't had to be exiled like I've read some people here have. That's just so sad to read to about and i hope those people are doing okay. I do feel like an outcast amongst coworkers who openly discuss their covid vaccinations and how happy they are with the new administration and BLM and pride and blah blah. I just don't comment (I think that is inappropriate work talk anyway). </p>
<p>Hope everyone is having a great week! Keep on keeping on</p>

        <p>Do you honestly think that?</p>
<p>In the UK 2/3 of the population has been vaccinated 75% and they're still talking about further lockdowns. </p>
<p>The only people who've not had it right now are children. </p>
<p>So the entire adult population. The population most at risk has been vaccinated. In fact 1/3 of elderly people vaccinated have died from old age since getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>You're just clinging on in denial about the whole thing. The vaccine is your psychological out and you just can't face the truth. </p>
<p>But that's fine because neither than 70% of the population. You'll realise it when things don't unlock and vaccine uptake is in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>You can't face that all those people lost their jobs, that the economy was ruined, that businesses went bust, that debt has increased and poverty had increased and the healthcare system has been ruined for no good reason. That hundreds of thousands are dying or suffering because they can't get that life changing surgery or chemo therapy because the empty hospitals refuse to see them.</p>

The most popular city in the country, which easily hosts the most concerts (besides LA), and they’re going to mandate injections at the door and demand proof.

        <p>A lot of my friends and friends of friends and family are (bending over) getting the vaccine “so they can travel”.  They hear things on the news about easing restrictions at the border for vaccinated travellers, etc etc. How likely will vacc passports be implemented for travel? </p>
<p>I won’t fall for it. People are forgetting as a Canadian: (1)Every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada. (2) Every citizen of Canada and every person who has the status of a permanent resident of Canada has the right: to move to and take up residence in any province; and. to pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province ...</p>

        <p>In EU they are developing this 'vaccine passport' which is an app, you will be registered there for vaccinations OR test results (blood/pcr) which allows to travel.  and may be used also for other events and outings.  Tests must be max 48 jours old. The EU tried to have that as only method for travelling but there still may be other restrictions as well (differences per country). Many people are taking the vaccine because they don't want to be testing all the time. 
The government cannot demand vaccination here but they can make it a lot more uneasy for people that dont want the vaccine to live normal life.</p>

        <p>I believe reddit was originally created with good intentions, but when our malevolent overlords fully grasped its power to engineer (astroturf) public opinion ... well, just look how the site turned out. If you used reddit back in the late 2000s, the difference will make you very sad.</p>

        <p>My brothers wife is braindead. I had lunch with my family, the topic came up, she said she was worried about mask mandates being lifted despite being vaccinated, because people are lying about being vaccinated. I said if someone is vaccinated, why does it matter if they come into contact with someone who isn't? She admitted she understands and may have been over reacting, but then had to quip "Darwin can take all the unvaccinated people". I wanted to get into a full-blown argument but my entire vaccinated family was there and it just wasn't worth it. All the people she wants dead still haven't died since February 2020. I think she's going to be waiting a while.</p>

        <p>Reddit is seriously ridiculous. I saw some /r/AskReddit threads back in early early 2020 asking what people thought about Covid-19, based on what they knew, and everyone responded as we did here, ie. "oh I heard it's a stronger version of the flu but nothing really to be worried about." </p>
<p>2020 really showed who the "sheep" are and who the independent thinkers are. </p>
<p>I think give it 5 years and you'll be seeing all these mainstream Reddit posts of people virtue signaling about how they realized this and that about Covid, the truth, bla bla bla. They don't want you to see in their post history just how easily they torn down others.</p>

        <p>The priority of China and Asian societies right now is to give their general population a comfortable life, with modest income opportunities, yet this requires some brutal anti-corruption orders. We're creating some kind of anti-poor, high-order middle-class in the process. It's almost fascist but more technocratic. No doubt the population will keep on growing and some classes will be marginalized so hard they will have to migrate.</p>
<p>But I predict politics will force these developing nations to keep escapees at home (advanced surveillance technology + military-civilian presence).</p>
<p>The solution is to build artificial islands which will require getting soil from seabed affecting neighboring countries. I think people will be ok at first, but we will underestimate the ambiguity of changing sovereignty affecting global geopolitics. And add climate change and depletion of natural resources in the mix.</p>

        <p>Lots of folks on a different sub report debilitating vaccine side effects that won't go away. And are openly regretting their decision to get the vaccine. It's tough to read about people learning the hard way, but I think there's a momentum shift (or at least a better awareness) against this vaccine because of these issues.</p>

        <p>I don't have anywhere or anyone to vent to about  this cuase they will say I should  go get the vax, so I guess I will post here.</p>
<p>To give some context  I practice a grappling  style  martial art. We had to stop  training  in person because  of covid. I was about  to test for my black belt but covid  put a stop to that. They started  classes again when vaccines started  rolling  out, luckily  it is not mandatory  for classes. Just "strongly encouraged". So I am the only  student  that chose not to take the shot. I keep my decision  to myself  because  unfortunately  everyone I train with is a doomer. In fact I hear some pretty  cringy  things  from them at times when it comes  to pass ports, so I keep my mouth  shut. There is no point  in arguing  with them  about it. Anyway  there is a seminar  with a guest  instructor  that is coming  this weekend  to teach. They are requesting proof of Vaccination or a negative  test within  48 hours. Ok I will get tested  I am Ok with  that. Well apparently  a lot of the rapid  test sites stopped  since the vax is out. I scheduled  a "rapid"  test at cvs pharmacy  since the website  said they do rapid  test. I scheduled  a rapid  test and I got confirmation  for a RAPID test. I go there, do the stupid  test and then they say it will be 2 to 5 days for the results. I'm like WTF I scheduled  a rapid  test. They said they don't  do rapid  and that it's  a error  on the website. The seminar  starts tomorrow, I called a few clinics  that still have rapid  test and they don't  take my insurance (I don't  have a primary dr) and it will cost $138 for a rapid  test. The only place that has rapid  test available  now is only  open while I'm at work. It might  sound stupid  to most but im pissed. I'm pissed that a stupid  virus  with a 99% survival  rate made everyone take a experimental shot and that it is constantly  used against me for rejecting it. Im pissed  that if you question  any on the inconsistencies about  covid you are gaslighted and labeled  crazy. I'm pissed that all of my friends I train with became covid  doomers  and I'm pissed about  the stupid rapid  test. I pissed that I wasn't  able  to test for my black belt and had to stop training  for over a year because  of a glorified  flu virus.   Okay I just had to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>Go donate blood. Make sure they do antibody testing and you can get the result. If your antibody test from your blood donation shows that you have antibodies, there is no medical reason that you need to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now, your authorities may not accept that, but that is indeed "the science".</p>

        <p>I do aikido, shedding has been on of my concerns since we started  training  again. It seems like it would  of been safer to train wither other none vaxed. But I will take my chances  tho and I would  rather have the natural antibodies that way. I was almost  about  to switch  to judo and jujitsu  because  there was a gym that stayed open and continued  training  throughout  the pandemic. I know aikido is looked down upon  but I enjoy  it and they do pressure test at my dojo so it's  not just "woo woo" stuff. I been with it for too long to just walk away, but I will not give into the fear  mongering  that covid created. If I have to switch arts or train  alone so be it.</p>

        <p>I'm fucking pissed. We're finally allowed to gather at church again, but the pastor said, in accordance with the "rules", that the congregation isn't allowed to sing. Even though he admitted tongue in cheek that it's hard to refrain from singing, he still told his flock, literally, to not vocally worship God during the service. And, the lead singers were unmasked but the drummer and bassist were masked. What the fuck.</p>
<p>Fuck this stupid brand of Christianity that licks the boot of their literal oppressors instead of kissing the feet of Jesus. I would attend a service to stir the pot, if it weren't for the fact I know the sermon is going to be shit, and I'd have to put up with the slurping sounds of obedient boot licking.</p>

        <p>I miss church.  I'm deeply disappointed that we turned our back on god so easily, that not a single priest was brave enough to defy lockdown. The faithful throw themselves to flames, into the lion's pit in love of our Father, but a <em>cold</em> is enough for these spoilt priests to start handwringing about how important He really is, I guess</p>

        <p>We just got our requirement to go to mass on Sunday's re-instated.  </p>
<p>But nearly all of the parishes are playing these games with masks, vaccinations, singing, etc.  For example, I've heard of parishes doing the whole vaccinated vs unvaccinated section.  Unvaccinated section requires masks and social distancing.  I was talking with someone that this doesn't make sense:  Even Fauci admits masks aren't that effective and you're essentially throwing all the unvaccinated people "together."  Wouldn't it make more sense to mix everyone up regardless of status?  That way, it would be less likely 2 unvaccinated people get too close and sneeze all over each other.  Isn't that the point of so called heard immunity?</p>

        <p>I don't go to church myself, but family members who do were telling me how they were not allowed to sing together, but up to 5 people can sing up the front. When I stopped laughing, I said I would consider <em>any faith that allows its worship to be outlawed to be</em> <em>worthless.</em> That didn't go down too well.</p>
<p>I have an uncle who is a pastor and worship leader; he simply re-branded congregational singing as 'talking in tune'. Cute, but still a compromise.</p>
<p>Anyway, for what its worth, coming from an old hypocrite, stay strong and keep your faith. This too shall pass.</p>

        <p>Most churches in the US are like this. They take the government hush money in the form of their tax exempt status as a 501c3 incorporation, but in exchange churches can't do things the government doesn't allow. It's been going on for a long time, it's just more obvious now.</p>

        <p>Sounds like textbook "hostile work environment": https://www.eeoc.gov/harassment</p>
<p>&rt;Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race, color, religion, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy), national origin, older age (beginning at age 40), disability, or genetic information (<strong>including family medical history</strong>).</p>
<p>&rt;Harassment becomes unlawful where 1) enduring the offensive conduct <strong>becomes a condition of continued employment</strong>, or 2) the conduct is severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive. Anti-discrimination laws also prohibit harassment against individuals in retaliation for filing a discrimination charge, testifying, or participating in any way in an investigation, proceeding, or lawsuit under these laws; or opposing employment practices that they reasonably believe discriminate against individuals, in violation of these laws.</p>

        <p>My friend's boss comes down from his castle everyday and makes a big deal about my friend being the only employee not to get the V in front of the other staff members. </p>
<p>Its no secret my friend has not gotten it. He is very open about his reasons &amp; hasnt tried to hide it at all.  But it still feels like his boss shouldn't keep bringing it up in front of the entire team? Its some sort of peer pressure guilt trip attempt, which is hilarious because my friend will never cave. </p>
<p>Are companies getting some sort of incentive from the govt if their entire staff is vaxxed? Tax writeoff? </p>
<p>That's the only reason I can think why certain companies are going so nuts over the vax thing, when they previously couldn't have cared less about the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Can you, though? Tell me, honestly... are you capable of choosing to be an antivaxxing Trump supporter? Seems to me that just like your sexual orientation, your moral and ideological orientations are set in stone as well. </p>
<p>One can pretend to be straight, or pretend to believe in a god, or pretend to support vaccination in order to fit in. A gay person can have sex with the opposite gender, a muslim can publicly renounce his faith, and an antivaxxer can let himself be injected in order to avoid persecution... but does that change what they really are inside? </p>
<p>IMO it's a weak excuse to persecute someone because they can theoretically choose not to be who they are. A fine example would be fat people. Most of the lefties are fiercely against saying bad things about fat people because they "don't have a choice". But they do, just like you have a choice to become a Trump supporter if you just make the choice. But like them, you can't, because every fiber of your being is against it, just like every fiber of their being wants that piece of cake. </p>
<p>Race is the one where you objectively, unquestionably have no choice in the matter. Everything else is technically a choice, and it's up to opinion at what point that choice is so painful that it's abusive to force a person to make it.</p>

        <p>Why isn't anyone talking about natural immunity? For anyone with a normal immune system, who has had the virus, it stands to reason that they are just as immune, if not more so, than someone vaccinated.</p>

        <p>My cynical thought: because relying on natural immunity for those who have had the virus means lower sales for the vaccine makers. And we can't have <em>that</em>. Oh, no. Of course not!</p>

        <p>It's wearing me down mentally at the moment. 
So my age group is now eligible for the vaccine and my friends are just pushing it down people's throats. 
My boss asked me yesterday if I've been contacted to get it. I said no. I'm 24 so I fall out of the age bracket. Everyone else I know is 25.</p>
<p>Like I'm just getting really scared for them all. They're just desperately wanting to take it without any thought at all of potential side effects. Yet nearly all the women who havent gone through menopause that I know have had irregular periods after having it. </p>
<p>Im not taking it. Nothing could make me take it. I'd honestly rather die than take that thing and I'm just scared that we're gonna have to watch them all try to have kids down the line unsuccessfully and then it turn out that the vaccine messed things up. </p>
<p>And even blood clots. I don't take hormonal contraception because the risk is too high for me. So I won't take this vaccine for the same reason. Regardless of the period thing. </p>
<p>Covid might give me blood clots too. But I'd rather take my chance. I'm young, Im active and eat pretty healthy. My chances of catching it are zero.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if you misunderstand me, or I am misunderstanding you.</p>
<p>I am not getting the shot. I am in a very low risk group for covid, I am concerned about the long term safety data, and the biggest reason of all: I already had Covid and am immune. It is against medical advice to get vaccinated for diseases to which you are already immune.</p>

        <p>correct me if I’m wrong, but you can still get covid again if you’re immune correct? Which means you can still spread it? The only issue at this point is avoiding any sort of mutation that would make the vaccines ineffective.</p>

<p>No, that's not what the word immune means.</p>
<p>You might be asking "Can you still get covid if you have antibodies?"</p>
<p>If you can still get covid while you have antibodies then the vaccine doesn't work anyway. Let me ask you, how do you believe a vaccine prevents someone from getting disease?</p>

        <p>statistically speaking the vaccine is around 95% effective and while we don’t know to what extent it prevents the spread of covid data among vaccinated people suggests it dramatically reduces the chance of spreading covid. Do you have a source that says anything more than “having antibodies might make you immune, but we aren’t sure yet.”</p>

        <p>&rt;Do you have a source that says anything more than “having antibodies might make you immune, but we aren’t sure yet.”</p>
<p>There's some disconnect here, and I think it might be your lack of immunology knowledge. If antibodies didn't make you immune to Covid, then the vaccine wouldn't make you immune to Covid, because all a vaccine does is cause you to produce antibodies.</p>
<p>A vaccine prevents disease by causing your body to generate antibodies against the germ that causes the disease. This is the same mechanism that happens when you are infected naturally, a vaccine just traditionally gives you inactivated and destroyed virus for your body to identify, rather than live virus. For instance, I had chickenpox as a kid, and now produce antibodies, so doctors recommend I don't get the chickenpox vaccine.</p>
<p>In fact, scientists needed evidence that people naturally infected by covid  made antibodies and were immune before they could develop a covid vaccine. If people didn't make antibodies from natural infection, then a vaccine would be pointless.</p>
<p>If this stuff is still flying over your head, I don't think I can present you with evidence that you will understand and will convince you, but I will try.</p>

        <p>We know you don’t want it and we’re trying to explain why it’s important for you to get it. According to the CDC, while not conclusive, the vaccines appear to hinder the spread of covid-19. This is critical because it can prevent any mutations occuring and jeopardizing the population. If we all get vaccinated the virus will not only be ineffective but will probably be near eradicated in time. It’snot about what you want or don’t want it’s about doing the right thing. I didn’t WANT to go out of my way and stand in line to get the vaccine twice but I know it’s not about me and I’m not getting it for me.</p>

        <p>Man I hope I can vent here. I am an university student and in 2020 I was looking forward to study 6 months abroad. Of course they canceled it and now I can finally leave in fall. But here comes what pisses me off. I am supposed to pay 2 grand for quarantine, with taking away all the student jobs I can't afford to pay that amount at all. I tried looking for flats so far but people want me to be vaccinated. I would be able to skip quarantine if I am vaccinated but there is no way I am doing this. I was told that if I don't have the 2k ready upon entry they will lock me up for up to 10 years. I am going to rot in prison because I am not brainwashing myself.</p>

        <p>Welp, I think my best friend since 8th grade either died to the vaxx or got seriously hospitalized.  </p>
<p>We talk to each other about twice a month, and I noticed I haven't heard from him in about two months.  Realized that last time I talked to him he was just a few days away from getting his second shot and I got a little worried and dug more into it.  </p>
<p>Easiest way I figured would be to check his Steam, he literally games every day and wanted to become a streamer once he could afford better equipment.  Steam says he hasn't been on in two months</p>
<p>Then I checked his mom's Facebook.  Most the stuff she posts is private but a month ago his little brother had his 18th birthday and from the photos he wasn't there.  Dude is not one to miss parties and celebrations, especially when its family. </p>
<p>The only comfort is that no obituary has showed up on Google yet.</p>

        <p>Why not reach out to his mom, tell her you are a bit worried as usually you speak to each other about every other week? I wouldnt mention your concern about the vaccine, but would want to find out what happened to my best friend. 
I do think if he died recently they probably would not be in a very festive mood for his brothers birthday. Anyway cannot harm to ask if you cannot reach him yourself.</p>

        <p>We cannot let them bury these myocarditis (and other vaccine injury) reports under the “but it’s so rare” excuse. Take a step back and look at this...young adults, human beings in the prime of their lives with their whole future ahead of them, are being hospitalized, scarred for life, and in worst cases, <em>dead</em>, from a vaccine purported to protect them from a disease they have a 99.9% chance of fully recovering from. NO serious injury, and certainly NO death, no matter how rare, is in any way acceptable under these circumstances. The risk/benefit cost is not justified. </p>
<p>It wouldn’t even be so bad if the same people writing off these adverse events, were also supporting freedom of choice. But no, it’s always “It’s a one in a million chance, so everyone <em>needs</em> to take it.” But if everyone takes it, <em>there will be premature deaths</em>. People will be maimed and/or killed by an intervention. Completely unacceptable. These risks need to be taken seriously by each and every person considering the vaccine, and they need to discuss with their doctor their personal risks with the virus, so that they can make an accurate personal-risk assessment. </p>
<p>If we can save just ONE life....hah.</p>

        <p>What's telling about this heart damage stuff, is that they are actually making a relatively big deal about it - unlike, you know, all the deaths/injuries that happened before. Those were easy enough to sweep under the rug with the help of the media's non-coverage, but apparently they're quite concerned about not being able to cover up perfectly healthy children being injured. Even the most robotic NPC knows their child shouldn't be having heart problems from one day to the next.</p>
<p>If the vaccines are doing that to teenagers and 20-somethings in the prime of life, then it's safe to assume the same thing was happening to mature adults as well - it was just easier to cover up and ignore because adults are more likely to have lots of other age-related problems. "Oh, your heart attack wasn't related to the vaccine - you're 45 years old, after all, and let's be honest, you could stand to lose a few pounds. Perfectly coincidental."</p>

<p>You know what's funny is these same people are typically in favor of mandatory vaccinations... So when I pose them the question "did you feel that way about mandating flu vaccines previous to this pandemic?" their first retort is always "it's not as deadly as COVID so no!!"</p>
<p>Sure, not <em>as</em> deadly. But still deadly nonetheless since thousands die of the flu every year. I guess "if it saves just ONE LIFE" applies to COVID but not to any other endemic disease? It's the hypocrisy for me lmao.</p>

<p>I have a very credible NYS senate source. They were up super late last night debating 103 bills on the floor. The chatter about Covid mandates for kids to attend school is this...</p>
<p>They know it will be approved in AUGUST. Like fully fda approved so they are placing the following to be at the ready to mandate:</p>
<p>Kids 12+ need the shot to attend public and private school starting September. 5+ will be January 2022.</p>
<p>Don’t kill the messenger. But y’all in NYS not already homeschooling you’ve been warned.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't surprise me a bit. These people are insane. Can they not even think 2 steps ahead to realize not only the divide this is creating, but that it's just continually adding fresh straw to the camel's back (the very structural integrity of this country)? Forcing everybody to &lt;XYZ&rt; just creates more people opting out and looking for permanent alternatives. Without compulsory public schooling, they can't brainwash the next generation to become dutiful little cogs begging for the next mandatory injection, no questions asked.</p>

        <p>Of course. But with every such escalation they risk more disaffection and loss of confidence in The System. That can only go on so long before one day it loses a critical quantum of support, and ... chaos.</p>
<p>I hope everybody has their popcorn because we have front row seats to the total collapse of the USA as we know it. Maybe not this year, but 2022 and beyond? There is 0% chance we make it to another presidential election completely intact.</p>

        <p>I honestly have no idea how to deal with the constant pressure/ shaming about not wanting the vaccine and it's almost pushing me to a breaking point tbh - my parents are very much on the same page and don't think it's necessary for me but my SO and his parents make me feel so uncomfortable about it. Especially since I'm going back to university in the fall I'm struggling so hard and feel like I'm eventually going to be pressured and end up basically being forced to get it.<br>
I'm having such a hard time with how this vaccine seems to have become political and so divisive and just the social pressure around it (especially in my age group) is driving me insane</p>

First of all that is not a vaccine.  By definition of what a vaccine is this is not that definition.  So there is no point discussing anything further with someone who creates stupid baseless idiot statements without backing them up with so much as a definition behind the word vaccine.  Go back to the line where the sheep are, take your experimental mRNA Gene therapy chemical which you are too stupid apparently to understand is not a vaccine.

        <p>Firstly, a vaccine is just something that is used theraputically to illicit an immune response to a pathogen that provides some level of immunity. Whether that's protein from virus or mRNA that encodes protein from a virus it's still a vaccine either way.</p>
<p>Secondly, there isn't a mechanism by which an mRNA molecule injected is going to cause genetic alteration, mRNA like this doesn't integrate into the genome, it can't even get into the nucleus, it's translated into protein in the cytoplasm and degraded like the rest of mRNAs in your cells.</p>

        <p>Vitamin-C:  used therapeutically to illicit an immune response to a pathogen that provides some level of immunity.  This fits your definition of a vaccine.  Therefore, due to your decree of semantic technicalities, Vitamin-C is now a vaccine.</p>

<p>There is a big difference. and to broad-brush this as semantic technicalities, while we are discussing . . .technicalities, sorry.  We fail to agree on the definition of a vaccine.  This is not by definition, a vaccine until you choose to just ignore the technicalities, sure, then it is.  Well, then why not just say, we're all gonna die in the end and cut to the chase?  The rest is just technicalities.  </p>
<p>We also factually see a massive increase of prion disease, shingles, things that are normally very rare.  You have correct knowledge on the area of </p>
<p>" it can't even get into the nucleus, it's translated into protein in the cytoplasm and degraded like the rest of mRNAs in your cells"</p>
<p>However, do you know what the level of "degradation" from lymphatic tissue to complete inert conclusion?  This is important to find the distinction regarding as it is 'degrading' at a much different rate than other cellular comparatives.  While creating protein blooms in sensitive vascular tissue, massive increase in deep vein thrombosis, hence the blood clots to strokes.  All the while, this is supposed to be a medication, a "vaccine" as you broad-brush, to provide immunity, which it factually has proven to fail to do.  </p>
<p>Do the lipids create the rest of the symptoms (and more) just mentioned?</p>

        <p>Change the word choice you're using away from vaccine and call this correctly by fact.  Highly experimental Gene modification medication.  Every time you are faced with this debate either with yourself or with an external party make sure you always reference this by fact of what it is and not the vaccine nature that it is not.<br>
For myself that perspective gives me all the confidence I need to know the choice I made is correct.  If you feel pressured pressure them back.  Show them people who have died from taking these experimental Gene modification medications. At that point they will try and shut down the conversation so then shut them down by stating that if you ever talk to me about this again and give an ultimatum accordingly that fits.  One so-called friend I told him never to talk to me again about this and if that's a problem for him than to never talk to me period. 
All right now you could be lying in a hospital bed with the top of your head cut off to relieve brain swelling while the dice roll of your life hangs in the balance as you line a coma from a blood clot and stroke. 
Choice is yours but at the end of the day being protected against covid is not the result that will occur from taking this experimental Gene modification medication.</p>

        <p>Watch the Vimeo of dr Peter McCullough or the speech from Dr Gold from American Frontline Doctors (search through another browser than Google). It helped me stand firm on my decision not to take it and I sent it to some people around me. May be they won't change their mind, but they may understand me better. More truth is coming to the surface now. People that still find us stupid now probably will think differently a few months from now. But my main reason is protecting my health and immune system.</p>

        <p>I had my first day back in work today (I work in a restaurant). I have always just worn a mask because I don’t even have the energy to be chased around by staff members in supermarkets etc. And I’m always fine in supermarkets. However, today was the hardest time wearing a mask I’ve ever had to deal with. I couldn’t breathe and was running around and felt like i was about to pass out. Fuck these people who say  “I hAvE AsThMa AnD I CaN bReAtHe JuST FiNe”. These people don’t work in fast paced service industry environments. They don’t have to be on their feet for 10 hours. You CANNOT speak for everyone.  I’m so mad that I’m forced to wear a mask in a complete oven of a building.</p>

I tell ya at my workplace as soon as corporate allowed their vaccinated employees to get rid of masks basically EVERY employee there ditched them</p>

        <p>While i also disagree with masks, are you able to wear a face shield instead? If not, what about getting a loose fitting mask. Or a mask that is actually breathable. I remember somewhere in the comments someone mentioned about a mask you can get online that doesnt do anything BUT IS breathable. Might as well get a breathable mask since theyre useless against a virus and is pretty much for virtue signalling. Another option is those flimsy blue medical grade masks. I find them really easy to breathe in. Although i also heard questionable chemicals were used in the production of those masks so i dont know if it is hazardous for long term use. Or just sneakily pull your mask below the nose when you need air.</p>

        <p>hi I'm new here and really need to vent about the face mask policy in the summer temps combined with the HOT stores</p>
<p>I moved to the southern US and many stores still have their own policy of requiring a mask, so fine I wear the mask, but now the temperatures and humidity have shot dramatically up because well its summer and it's the south. what I didn't expect was that stores are not adjusting their AC to accommodate the heat from the shoppers and weather. I have tried all different sorts of facemasks, but they all have been trapping the hot air from my nostrils in the space between my skin and the mask itself, resulting in a hot steamy condition there. even when it was winter, it felt like a hot swamp under my mask. but now in the summer it is absolutely unbearable. </p>
<p>other shoppers were wiping their foreheads from the sweat and fanning themselves and complaining of the temps, but honestly wearing the mask on top of it was just miserable. I seriously couldn't stay in the stores long... and for the naysayers yes I do online shop /pickup as much as I can... but there's certain stores/items where you have to go in!</p>
<p>I have also struggled with acne for a long time and it had started clearing up and my skin was really nice during last winter and the spring, until recently because all of the sweating from wearing the mask has caused my acne to flare back up ... of course in the areas that the mask covers. I come home and wash my face to clean off the sweat but it doesn't matter... after working yesterday there were FOUR pimples that appeared just from wearing the mask!</p>
<p>I am so annoyed because I had to purchase my heavy duty acne cleanser which is expensive (and rarely if ever goes on sale) to combat the maskne. if the stores still want to require face masks then they need to set the AC to accommodate the awful heat and humidity OR allow masks to be optional</p>
<p>end rant</p>

        <p>I am not endorsing masks in the least, but if they are unavoidable, just wear it under your nose like 50% of people do already. It basically signals minimal obedience, which is all these assholes really care about.</p>

<p>Another you can try to do is use a face mask all day, I have not done this myself. It’s that blue material that is fucking awful.</p>

        <p>I definitely would not casually recommend that shit. It's very strong and can absolutely fuck up your skin if you aren't careful. </p>
<p>I used it every night (the recommendation on the product) for roughly 8 months and my skin would not stop breaking out. It was red, irritated, and so damn dry. I kept thinking that it would eventually work its magic and clear my skin up, but it didn't. I eventually gave up and used it like once a week and finally saw the results I wanted, but it took a long time for my skin to heal and start looking normal again.</p>

        <p>i’ve been on summer break for a while and haven’t been going anywhere so I kinda forgot how hysterical everything is outside, but the other day I took a plane to Hawaii for vacation and seeing all the masked people and wear a mask signs was so sad. the pandemic put my mental health at an all time low (most likely permanently) and the whole plane ride i just thought of everything this scam has done for the world and to me and I just wanted to cry the whole time and I couldn’t stop thinking about suicide the whole day even when I tried to clear my mind. I just feel like there’s nothing that can be done at this point I feel like the bad guys won for once. oh and here in hawaii they are very strict with masks it’s so frustrating. </p>
<p>I just remembered the most baffling part, in order to actually go to hawaii you have to take a covid test and show the negative results to some hawaii covid website and you’ll be put on the whitelist if you’re a pure one (not a filthy untouchable) and they were STILL making us wear masks on the flight despite everyone literally testing right before and everyone being negative. It’s all just theatre.</p>

        <p>This is a great time for all of us normal people to withdraw our support en masse for any company, any industry who is still forcing this ridiculous bullshit on people.</p>
<p>I certainly won't be flying ever again until masking/testing/quarantining comes completely to an end. And I know there are more like me, which means airlines are never going to go back to 2019 levels of activity (on top of all the business they are already losing to Zoom-as-the-new-normal).</p>
<p>Shop local every chance you get, give your money to honest, sane people who aren't virtue signaling against their own customers (eg Coca-Cola, but really all of them at this point). Every one of these big chains forcing this masked humiliation on their own customers and employees deserves to shrivel and die.</p>
<p>States like Hawaii deserve to lose a big chunk of their tourism money. It will remain a fine destination for masked nu-humans, but the rest of us can go to Florida.</p>

        <p>"Fortunately" for travel purposes, most of the people in NNN probably have family that would prefer they stay away from any gatherings over vaccination concerns. So we won't be pressured into traveling anywhere anytime soon, not even Thanksgiving 😎</p>
<p>As for me personally, I was already pretty flight-averse because it's such an uncomfortable, undignified experience. I'd rather drive even extreme distances over several days, than fly in the present era. And to think you now have to wear a mask on long-haul flights, even if vaccinated, on top of all the other miserable bullshit. lololol no thanks!</p>

        <p>I’ve been there, living alone, broke and hating my job with a drug dealer living upstairs who stamped around day and night and then burgled me. No sleep, skin and bones and very little to live for but shit I had forgotten about all that until what you said and my life now is sorted that turned around in such a short space of time. You have to keep wading through the shit to find an exit and then drag yourself out of that ditch. Adding a Pandemic is just the next level up, Life - Survival Mode edition.</p>

        <p>I don’t know what to say to my clients at work when they ask if I’m vaccinated. I have run out of excuses. At first it was I couldn’t because I’m not in the age group, and then when it opened up for my age my excuse was the website was too laggy, but now it’s been a month and idk what to say to them. </p>
<p>I work in healthcare and it really is none of their business what choices I make but saying “I don’t feel comfortable disclosing that information” really does make it obvious that I haven’t got it and makes me look like I’m “anti vax”. Because if someone got the vaccine they will tell you. And I will 100% lose clients over this because people are fucked. </p>

        <p>Are you of child-bearing age, male or female? Do you have a partner? I would say that my partner and I are wanting to get pregnant in the near future and we've both agreed we want to be as natural as possible in this process, certainly nothing experimental! This is personally true for me. </p>
<p>Also, I haven't even taken as much as an aspirin in 5 years - I don't take anything chemical / pharmaceutical. I have had very bad experiences with Pharma drugs in the past, including antibiotics and corticosteroids. Now I am 100% holistic health. When you tell people that you don't take any drugs, not even OTC painkillers, they usually lay off in my experience.</p>

        <p>I dont understand this concern from people about other people being vaccinated or not. Even in the MSM here in the Netherlands they say it is not yet clear if vaccinated people can spread the virus or not. 
Anyway I just simply say I am not getting the vaccine. I only explain if they ask more.
I have a private therapy practice and most people are happy they don't have to wear masks here and so far in my work no one asked yet about the vaccine. But that may be also because only now my age group can get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I can already see how the rest of this year is going to go in Ontario and it's depressing me... We'll finally reach the end of the longest fucking reopening plan in the entire world at the start of August, have 2 months of 'freedom', then be slammed back into lockdown because of the "dElTa vArIaNt" taking over and fat fuck Ford will just be all "we can't be certain the vaccines are fully effective against this variant since research is inconclusive so we need to lock down again folks!!" and bam, back into lockdown again.</p>

        <p>Close friends and loved ones are who we should never give up on. I've seen people on here advocating for severing relationships over ideological differences.  That is how society breaks down and we become isolated.  It's likely one of the intended outcomes of all of this division we've seen recently, as isolated people are easier to control.  </p>
<p>We're actually stronger by having people in our lives with whom we disagree. Don't give up.</p>

        <p>Hmmmmm I hope you're right, but Canadians are way too passive. I thought we would have seen resistance by now with the federal quarantine hotels/prisons and when Ford announced his trash reopening plan. Sure, there was anger... But no rebellion against it. So i'm not holding my breath on things changing if there is another lockdown this fall. People will probably just complain, but happily go along with it.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the link! I like this guy, instantly subscribed. Very based. Though I think he has a bit too much optimism on Canadian voters making the right choice when election time comes. Especially since none of the alternative parties will be any better IMO. </p>
<p>Has he been doing those walk and talks during curfew? I love that. I assume he was able to get away with it because of his dog right?</p>

        <p>Yeah he's a great guy. He has a whole series of himself going out after curfew to "walk the dog" though he carried it most of the time.  He started his channel delving into current lawsuits, which I find interesting, but he really got a following speaking his mind about US election fraud, lockdown and curfew.  I also felt like his proposed solution of "voting them out" was a bit weak.  Perhaps he wasn't comfortable calling for mass disobedience and protests.  </p>
<p>He does a lot of livestreams with PJ Barnes, who is a US attorney who is equally based and fun to listen to.  Glad you enjoyed the video.</p>

        <p>Could be, or just one petty person who is moderator of multiple subs.</p>
<p>Pretty hilarious how WE get accused of brigading when these people go out of their way to write bots just to ban us for wrongthink - in subs we never even visit. Good ol' reddit with their selective enforcement.</p>
<p>Mods of NNN, is there a way you can bring this stuff to the attention of the reddit admins? Not that I would expect them to give much of a shit, but it would be nice to get some kind of official response out of them. Do they condone preemptively banning people who aren't even participating in a particular sub?</p>
<p>If only all of reddit had to adhere to its own rules as precisely and delicately as subs like this one do. Just imagine how stressful it must have been being a mod over at /r/the_donald at the tail end of its existence.</p>

        <p>Yeah, we're probably from the same country and this is depressing.</p>
<p>I understand that the vast majority of people in this subreddit are from the US and therefore that's why a huge part of the posts around here are related to US, and it depresses me how the US is already over with it and has stuff that can at least protect some of their privacy while we have none of this in a third-world authoritarian hell hole.</p>
<p>I'm kinda afraid of what might happen in the future for us, specially since I'm actually at the last year of college and sometimes I think that I will have to accept that, unless I really drop out college and be ready to be disowned by my family (almost was in the past due to not wanting to attend college at all after hs) and go starve in the streets, I'm probably going to forced to get this damn shot and basically just pray that I won't have any side effects from it in the future (which we don't know)</p>
<p>So yeah, I honestly think things will only go worse for the world from now on, and no one will do a thing to stop it.</p>

        <p>They report the results of vaccine passport surveys and it’s always around 75% in favour. I’m assuming anyone who gets vaccinated is also in favour of this bad idea.   I don’t believe either of these statistics.</p>

        <p>Just was on a family visit. Heard that the brother from my brother in law was admitted to hospital after the vaccine. He was on morfine for severe pains. They still think it is good he tot the vaccine cause 'he wouldnt have survive survived Covid'. 
I saw a post yesterday on social media from a colleague saying hoe she had bad symptoms (pain / lymph nodes) from the vaccine and she still wants the 2nd vaccine 'to feel protected and so the is allowed to go on holiday'. She would only want a different brand. </p>
<p>I am truely stupified how hypnotised everyone is so that even still after such reactions they do not question the vaccine or the policy in general.</p>

        <p>The ugly truth is that normal humans were evolved to blindly go along with whatever the tribe around them believed. We are freakish exceptions to this, and just as in the past, they will do whatever they can to suppress or expel us.</p>
<p>The fundamental validity of the individual (vs. the tribe/society) is a SUPER recent invention in human civilization, and it appears it may be going extinct relatively soon.</p>

        <p>To be fair, a lot of vaccines make you feel like shit afterwards. That part doesn't weird me out. The part I'm concerned about is long-term side-effects. Injecting the entire population with a whole new type of vaccine that's never been used before seems extremely reckless to me. Supposing a year or two later, we find out it causes auto-immune disease or something? I'm sure as hell not going to take the risk until I see how it effects others.</p>
<p>I already had covid anyway, so I should have some degree of natural immunity.</p>

        <p>I got my first ban now. I was reading through the posts of Covidvaccinated and reacted to a post of a kid that wanted to convince his parents to get him vaccinated to get more freedom. He already had had Covid with mild symptoms. I said he probably would have more health risks with taking the vaccine than without it (considering his mild reaction to Covid) and then I was banned from reacting cause I was spreading 'conspiracy theories'. What a world we live in...</p>

        <p>His mild Covid case probably gave him lifelong immunity too. You shouldn't be getting a vaccine for a disease you are already immune to.</p>

        <p>Sorry, where did you see something about long-term immunity in the article? or were you referring to a different article?</p>
<p>At the end, that nature article states "...the persistence of antibody production, whether elicited by vaccination or by infection, does not ensure long-lasting immunity to COVID-19. The ability of some emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants to blunt the protective effects of antibodies means that additional immunizations may be needed to restore levels, says Ellebedy.

        <p>Just dropping in my two cents here, I did a ridiculous amount of research, I'm for getting vaccinated(for me), however anyone else who decides not to doesn't bother me. Freedom of choice. It certainly wasn't an easy choice for me. I certainly wouldn't uninvite a relative over their choice to not be vaccinated either. My family almost didn't let me come over because my 5 yearold would be with me who obviously wasn't vaccinated. Some people are being overly ridiculous and letting this ruin their connections with their family.</p>

        <p>I am also curious about this. From the posts I’ve seen here and other similar subs it seems like there’s some vague language regarding coercion (which would probably be a drawn out court battle) but that the govt also said companies can do what they want with regard to these particular vaccines.</p>

        <p>Off the top of my head, there are two specific things in the US that might be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ADA - if you have a valid medical concern regarding vaccines, an employer has to make reasonable accommodations.  In other words, there has to be a valid business justification as to why an employee needs to be vaccinated.  The obvious example would be jobs healthcare directly dealing with/treating patients.  But, if you're just a back office worker and wouldn't come into contact with the general public, medical samples, etc. then there's less of an argument.<br>
I suppose that an argument can be made that the employees are older, but again, if the overwhelming majority of them are vaccinated, what is the point?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OSHA - I've read places where if a company requires vaccination, then the company is responsible for any negative outcome from vaccinations. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, both of these can be very hard to prove and it seems like doctors are doing a poor job at consoling patients that have valid concerns, like myself.</p>

        <p>The American/State/Local Governments likely have Epidemiologists on staff who use computational models to predict how many liars there are about getting the vaccine (read: most of the people who post here) it would take to throw off their transmission rate, versus global/national/local rates which is why many states are just finally opening up.</p>

        <p>I’m actually scared of catching Covid as I do believe it’s a bio weapon and heard the spike protein can cross the blood brain barrier and cause dementia later in life. But, I’m even more scared of the vaccine and will never get it. </p>
<p>I was feeling good about feeling a little more safe in public again until I heard about this delta variant. Is this truly a legitimate concern or is it just the media trying to drum up more fear? I can’t take being afraid to live much longer.</p>

        <p>See I had heard that statistic and believe it for the most part. But the reason this delta variant is getting to me is because of the huge numbers that were in India.

        <p>To put it in perspective, India has 1/6 of the world's population. If you calculate the cases and deaths on a per-capita basis, the numbers in the Indian wave look very similar to what has been going on in several other countries.</p>

        <p>I've got the same curiosity. India is very different from the USA or other global north countries. So it's not an apples to apples comparison.</p>
<p>Also, I have a very hard time believing the media, posts on reddit, things texted to me, etc. There's so much disinformation, it's very hard to filter. </p>
<p>I won't worry until I see, with my own eyes, something worry about.</p>

        <p>&rt;All these variants are at most 0.3% different from the original thing.</p>
<p>And humans are 99% the same as Chimpanzees.</p>
<p>It's ridiculous to judge difference in variants based only on percentage of similarity on genetic sequencing. Where those differences are is what matters.</p>

        <p>Don't you think it'd be better if we curb it while the difference is only 0.3%? If he comes back when it's 1%, it's probably because we failed to stop the mutations.</p>

        <p>I have the feeling they are emphasizing the different mutations to keep the fear going. 
In India the situation is pretty bad but I think it has to do with the fact it is rainy season there. In most tropical countries Covid cases are rising in rainy session as that is their flu season, like winter is in America or Europe. 
Try to find ways to not be fearful, your immune system is wonderful and works  best when you are calm.

        <p>Yes, you can in fact sue the federal government if you have serious side effects due to their negligence. </p>
<p>This was the agreement that was reached with vaccine manufacturers. Because they were getting served massive amounts of baseless lawsuits, the US took liability of vaccines upon themselves due to them beginning to refuse vaccine development over these lawsuits. </p>

        <p>Things are definitely better but I’m finding that I still have anger about this and fear about the future. I’m hoping that there will be some accountability and consequences for the health “experts”, politicians, and lockdown supporters who let this kind of insane distraction happen. I could be waiting forever, so I need to accept that this might not happen.  </p>

        <p>Don't worry, it's not over. The card has been played and things are going to continue ramping up. Tons of cards left to get us to the biological convergence, singularity, transhumanist pipe dream of the Great Reset by 2030. Will it be a cyber attack? An alien invasion? Pandemic 2, which we "will take seriously this time." So many options we've been predictively programmed for!</p>

<p>This is not over tbh, politicians and health "experts" will just get away with what they did just fine. And more narratives to curb the civil liberties of society are coming, the next card they will play is the climate change card. Expect stuff like Agenda 2030, Great Reset, Green New Deal etc.</p>

        <p>The senate of my country has just approved a vaccine passport today, I bet there will be no backlash against it and nothing that I can do.</p>
<p>I'm also a college student and I'm pretty sure that college will probably require a vaccine passport, and as much as I wish I could just drop it, I'm already at the last year of it so yeah.</p>
<p>I have a huge conviction of not taking a vaccine I have no idea of long term side effects (no one does actually) but at the same time, the fear of not being able to live my life as I want is consuming me, I'm trying to remember this is fear tactics they're using to get people to vaccine but at the same time, I don't know what the future holds in this country for people that refuse the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Is a vaccine passport only about vaccines in your country? In EU they talk about passports but it is an app, also for a test result (pcr or antibodies). I still am against it but at least if I want to travel I can do it with a test, not only vaccination.</p>

        <p>Yeah so when everyone mercilessly mocked conspiracy theorists for thinking mRNA could rewrite your DNA, it is because there was no evidence of reverse transcriptase activity in human cells. Now it turns out there is reverse transcriptase activity, in every mammalian cell lol. This doesn't <em>prove</em> anything yet, but it's a mechanism.</p>
<p>To me, this highlights two things: First, the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. It is absolutely unscientific to think that just because we don't yet have evidence of something, that something is impossible. And second, high schools are really failing to teach the Nature of Science and NOS communication.</p>

        <p>This place is like a beautiful tropical island in an ocean of misinformation and despair. I have been on the skeptic side since Dallas County used Neil Ferguson's failed model to start locking down counties in Texas in mid March 2020. After the lockdown announcement came out they were predicting 500k Texans dying in <strong>90 days</strong> if we didn't institute Wuhan style lockdowns. Twitter comments were doing the math and thinking that is almost 6000 people dying per day for 90 days! You all know the drill, it started with 2 weeks to slow the spread (with the original charts showing most people getting sick anyways) and now we are in zero covid territory. Thankfully I live in Texas where the lockdowns weren't so bad but I can't even put a mask on anymore and was one of the few who would go into stores without a mask before mandates were removed. </p>
<p>My wife is tired of hearing me complain about it so I am so glad I found this place. I just can't believe Reddit allows this sub to exist because it goes against the precious Science®.</p>

        <p>I'm infuriated by the "it's the law" people who just say we have to follow the law and there's no point forming our own opinions on whether it's right or not. Like you do know that laws change right?!?! For example, let's talk about gay rights...here in Aus a few years back there was a big controversy about gay marriage. Now most people have an opinion on it and regardless of how the ruling would eventually be decided, they didn't change their mind. People who were strongly for or against it would remain that way regardless of any new laws. Nobody who had already thought about the topic in depth was going to change their mind based on "the law", because they know in their own beliefs what's right and wrong. The exact same thing applies to all other new laws that are introduced...previously, I felt strongly against laws mandating what I should wear, based on for example hijabs. I applied my previous beliefs to oppose mandatory masking last year. No amount of mask mandates will change my belief that it is wrong. </p>
<p>You must have your own internal set of morals and do what's right in your own beliefs...I don't oppose ALL laws but I do think it's important to examine why you do or don't like any new ones that are proposed instead of just blindly following. Do you really have any opinions or beliefs if you would change them overnight based on a politician signing a paper somewhere?</p>

        <p>It's fucked because two years ago those same people would say, "Just because it's the law doesn't make it right or morally correct."</p>
<p>Now if you question or blatantly disregard "the rules" you are the worst person and those people can feel morally superior despite the absolute hypocrisy of it all.</p>

        <p>Decided to check out the TJ Maxx that opened near me. Walked up to the doors and saw the "wear a mask" signs, which don't really mean anything now. Went inside and saw someone standing guard at the hygiene theater station. I stared at her. She stared at me. I rolled my eyes and left.</p>
<p>Free market, bitch.</p>
<p>(Meanwhile I noticed the CVS got rid of every single mask, covid, and vaccine sign. Such enthusiasm!)</p>

        <p>I also went to a TJ Maxx today. Same deal, sign on the door, Karen-looking hygiene guard at the door...except, we looked at each other, both said hello, and I walked right past completely maskless. Not another word was uttered. 90% of other customers were also maskless. This is the second time I’ve had that exact experience there. I have 0 idea why they bother with that charade if they don’t actually do anything...maybe I just lucked out with employees who don’t care, or maybe they’re just there for the people who like playing along. </p>
<p>I do live in a pretty rural area, though. They’re basically the only business still in town with mask signs on the door. They’re probably tired of trying to convince the whole community to still wear a mask in their store, lol. </p>
<p>Anyway, it was kinda liberating to call their bluff.</p>

        <p>I'm really glad I live in a redneck town where nobody gives a fuck. Even in the thick of covid when they had a walmart door guard who told you to put your mask on, at least 50% of shoppers would just blow them off and nothing came of it. Now that they've done away with the mask mandate statewide, it's like 1% of people who still wear masks.</p>

<p>Had the ONE guy I know personally that has caught Covid (and survived miraculously) tell me today that he had the virus, was sick for a week and beat it. </p>
<p>He then said he took the shot and ‘felt like pure shit afterwards, like worse than when I had Covid’ </p>

        <p>Just saw an article talking about the "Delta variant" and how places may start going back into lockdown because of how incredibly fast it spreads. NOT because it's proved to be more deadly, but just because it spreads faster.</p>
<p>In the article it says they don't know how the vaccines will work against it, but they say people need to get it anyway and places are going to start pushing the vaccines more</p>

        <p>In order to get to your second point from the first it's to be assumed that this variant is more serious in the way it infects people, driving them to have to be admitted to hospitals. Which was nowhere stated in the article (and you'd think it would be)</p>
<p>And that is also to assume the medical care system is that bad in general. In 3rd world countries I'd understand this concern, but first world countries? Don't see that</p>

        <p>I do recall also seeing news in the past about hospitals being overwhelmed with patients, pre covid times, who had the flu. Without so much of lockdowns and restrictions being mentioned, but of course suggestions (nothing mamdatory) on getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>So i apologize, i take back what I said about not seeing it happening in first world countries, that was naive of me. I may have overestimated their ability to learn from past situations.</p>

        <p>I’m pro vaccine but the way some people who are also apparently pro vaccine act makes me think there’s no point and that we’re just going to stay in this cycle</p>
<p>Look, I’m not anti-mask. If you want to wear a mask, then by all means do so. But I literally had a conversation with multiple people earlier that devolved into “well my roommate got Pfizer and still got COVID! WEAR YOUR MASKS EVEN IF YOU’RE VACCINATED. YOU CAN STILL CATCH IT. YOU CAN STILL TRANSMIT.”</p>
<p>Okay but then what’s the point in getting it? Even if 100% of the country was vaccinated, these people would still be screaming about safety precautions because breakout cases.</p>
<p>The vaccine significantly lessens your chance at getting it and as a result lessens your chance at transmitting it. But if we’re screaming “wear your mask” because people get breakout cases then what’s the point anyway?</p>
<p>It just screams “I don’t trust the vaccine” to me from people who are supposed to be pro vaccine.</p>
<p>We’re never going back to normal and at this point I really don’t blame people who don’t want to get vaccinated because it’s sounding like from some people that it doesn’t matter if you do anyway because you still have to social distance and wear a mask 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>Not happening and that’s extremely unrealistic. Barring the people who don’t want the vaccine, some people can’t get it for whatever reason (such as medical reasons). And even if that were the case and the US, for instance, was 100% vaccinated, see above mentioned “breakout cases.” We aren’t ridding the world of COVID.</p>

<p>You can already see it, Agenda 2030, Great Reset, Green New Deal, the WEF recommending people to eat cicadas this summer etc. THIS will be the next thing they will use.</p>

        <p>WTF is up with Austria? I'm going on holiday there in July and you need proof of vaccination/negative test/recovery to sit outside a restaurant. </p>
<p>Healthy people outside in the middle of summer. Literally zero risk and it's plainly obvious that covid won't be back till the next viral season. Now I have to let them molest my brain through my nose just to enjoy a beer by a mountain hut after a long day in the mountains. On top of that I'm risking a false positive every few days and having my holiday ruined. It's a fucking circus. I'm glad I live in Switzerland instead of that authoritarian shithole (with great mountains, lovely people and cheaper prices).</p>
<p>Btw. Any Austrians here have an idea of how strictly the 3G stuff is checked in mountain huts (specifically in Voralberg near st. Anton am Arlberg)? I'm really not interested in having my brain massaged every few days just to grab a beer.</p>

        <p>So an acquaintance sadly posted on social media that her NINE MONTH vacation in a resort area is coming to an end. She usually lives in a newly-remodeled million-dollar home, has everything material she could ever want, and has an ultra-powerful hubby in the medical field. She is devastated because her nearly adult kids are leaving home. They were so terrified by the "pandemic" that they rented a home in a resort area for nine months in a different state. This mom bleached the steps and posted about it after her daughter's friend briefly visited outside their home. </p>
<p>What I can't comprehend, among other things: she spent several minutes of her vacation furiously posting about how black lives matter. How does someone like her even relate? She hasn't spoken to anyone except select white people for years. </p>
<p>I have a couple of rich friends who are traveling the world. One lives in London and is close with a prestigious UK official - she and her family don't seem to be under lockdown at all. They are loving life and their travels.</p>

        <p>People's vocal concern for social justice is often inversely proportional to the amount of the time they spend among the parts of society they claim to care soooo much about.</p>
<p>&rt; They are loving life and their travels.</p>
<p>Of course, which is why it was so easy to get the rich and powerful on board with all of this: they aren't losing their perks at all, and can simply go around believing they are being wonderfully responsible custodians of ~~the cattle~~ society.</p>

        <p>Wtf there is something in the air today. My BF and I were walking down the street, where our town happened to have a dining outside event. Almost no one (except employees) are wearing masks. Some random old guy walks up to us aggressively and says without preamble, "ARE YOU VACCINATED?" My BF, the goof, just says, "No." Me, I say, "go fuck yourself." The guy starts ranting about how we have to wear masks if we're not vaccinated as we walk away.</p>

        <p>Only 64% of American adults are fully vaccinated. Is that right? They said that on the news.</p>
<p>Weird because pretty much 100% of US adults have had the chance to be fully vaccinated for weeks now. So is it true? 36% of us aren’t gonna get it?</p>
<p>I don’t see the “must be vaxxed to keep your job” stuff working if it eliminates 36% of American adults from the workforce. </p>

        <p>I was about to buy a ticket to France after reading about how they were open now to Americans with a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours of their flight. I could have sworn you could still go if you weren't vaccinated as long as you had a negative test. Apparently you have to have a "compelling" reason to go there. I was tempted to get vaccinated in order to travel but I'm holding out. I'm low priority on when I can take my vacation days so this sucks. I know there are countries in Europe where unvaccinated Americans can go without quarantining but they weren't places on my to go to list (at least now).</p>

        <p>All that this "compelling reason" to go means is that you have to feel out a form stating the purpose of your visit. Just write "work" or medical reason on the form and you're good. No one checks further than that. Ask me how I know lol</p>

        <p>Yes they must have a snooping glass heart mod going bananas. I also don't post there and was banned right after I offered sympathies to a man here who experienced myocarditis, with the claim that it's because I've commented here. Hilarious that they've got a fragile unhinged mod, because I replied to the ban asking when if ever I commented on their sub, and no response.</p>

        <p>So it looks like the extension of lockdown in England is coming on Monday using their usual leaking on the weekend tactic. At this point, what the fuck do you do? You can't fight it on an individual level, you need mass numbers of people to rebel.</p>
<p>I was really looking forward to the first big motorcycle meet in a couple of weeks which will no doubt now be cancelled, despite being outside. If the 500-1000 people who might attend still just turned up, what would happen?</p>

        <p>Please ignore the irony of this question being posted on Reddit on the weekend. However, I would like tips on how I could ween myself of the Internet. Mind you, I don’t want to leave the Internet completely because I need to check my bank statement every day and I do enjoy the book suggestions from NNN, but I feel like I need to be free from the Internet and the constant need to check it every day.</p>

        <p>Two parts. First, get rid of the technology. It's as much the content (internet/social media) as it is the medium of smartphones and computers. Second, find different ways to do what you were doing on the internet and to fill your time.</p>
<p>Here's what I had to do to take a break - I switched to a no-text flip phone, cancelled wifi, got rid of the TV in the house too. I go to the library if I want to download stuff to laptop or to use one of the computers there.  Also have the internet at my dad's house, so I often take the computer and kids over there so they can get some time together and I can fart around on reddit like I am right now.</p>
<p>I found that most people just didn't want to communicate with me by phone call or writing letters. But I realized those relationships that fell away were shallow in the first place and only existed because social media allows these incredibly shallow 'relationships' to occur.</p>
<p>For entertainment I do stuff with my kids, exercise, and of course, I read books again. I've read probably a dozen books in the past two months over a wide variety of topics. Your whole way of thinking changes when you switch to physical text.</p>
<p>I'mn probably still on the internet too much, and that's unavoidable for now, but I've gone from 12+ hours a day to like 1-2.</p>

        <p>People would quickly form new relationships just to survive. I doubt most people would miss the old ways after a few months of hardship and realizing how satisfying face-to-face interactions are, by comparison.</p>
<p>We aren't biologically wired for the infinitely distant and mediated "connections" that have become the norm. But the structure of the modern world has forced this way of being onto us, like it or not.</p>

        <p>I hope it works for you! I found that the protean nature of the phone meant that I could not keep it and not use it; if I got a message, I would start scrolling social media. If I checked my email, I would start browsing reddit.</p>

        <p>I've been feeling this need too. I'm at the point now where I want the internet to die... there's so much great stuff being cancel cultured to death just because someone films it on their phone and it goes viral on social media and offends the snowflakes. </p>
<p>Before the internet, unless you did something outrageous enough to make the national news, you could have your little private groups and local communities where you do your thing and nobody bothers you. Now, some SJW films it, tweets it, and next thing you know, millions of people are on a passionate crusade to end some obscure subculture they didn't even know existed until that one SJW saw it and got offended.</p>
<p>And like being an actor or any kind of public figure is basically impossible now, because you've got millions of armchair sleuths trying to dig up dirt on you, and all it takes is one SJW on twitter finding a dirty joke you made 20 years ago to end your career.</p>
<p>So yeah, I not only want to get off the internet, I pray that, one way or another, it gets destroyed. It's an amazing and powerful tool, but at this point it's doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>At the very least, I want social media to die. Having the world dictated by a horde of opinionated sheeple isn't great.</p>

        <p>Set a schedule, with phone alarms.</p>
<p>For example at 11am after doing various other things I get an alarm 'Start work!'. </p>
<p>Get in the habit of just stopping whatever you're doing and follow the schedule you set for yourself.</p>
<p>You'll slip up a lot at first but keep building on it, and set easy goals, like one hour of work, not 4 hours or whatever</p>

        <p>It's an interesting video. I'm glad there are people like James Corbett to keep an eye on the big picture. I have no doubt the elite are making plans for this eventuality, but I'm not convinced it will be forced on people who don't agree with transhumanism. Those who don't want it will simply be left behind like the Amish.  </p>

        <p>Since nobody can interact with my posts, I’ll say this here. We’re supposed to get “the call” today about masks. It looks like it might be leaning towards only vaccinated people don’t have to wear masks as long as they show proof. I feel a sense of stress, sadness, and anger throughout my workplace. I know the nuts are gonna make it so only the vaccinated can run around maskless but the rest of us still have to wear masks. I just <em>know</em> it. We haven’t had the “meeting” <em>yet</em> and I wish they would hurry tf up because they were supposed to tell us yesterday, now supposedly they’re telling us today. Just rip the fucking bandaid off and tell us!!! My two favorite coworkers and I decided that we’re gonna walk out if they don’t make it fair. They shouldn’t be arguing over something that has to do with us. This is <em>our</em> argument. Not theirs!! They don’t work on the floor with us so I don’t know why they’re making a big fucking deal about it. It’s not a big deal so just let us have the choice. It should’ve been a choice to begin with but noooo they just want all the fucking control. The majority of my coworkers have different demons they’re dealing with so if a bunch of us decide to walk out, I’ll miss them like crazy. They’re all like my family. I don’t want to walk out, nobody does, but if they don’t play fair then we’ll have to.</p>

        <p>Not remotely possible, if they were vaccinating people with pure liquid magnetic fluid there's wouldn't be enough of it to be strong enough to stick something to your skin, there's nothing already present in your blood or tissues that it would be able to magnetise, even if there was any way that would be possible.

<p>That's just a cheap magic trick that anyone can do... fucking idiots giving the vax nazi's evidence that antivaxxers are stupid. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if those people are actually vax nazi's pretending to be <strong>mentally challenged</strong> antivaxxers to take credibility away from the smart ones.</p>
<p>As for the trick, try it yourself. Get your skin nice and clean and moisten it just a little bit, then place any smooth object against it. All you have to do is lean back just slightly and it will stick there thanks to the tackiness of slightly moist skin. Just do it with a metal object and claim that you're magnetic and gullible people will fall for it, lol.</p>

        <p>Its probably real. If not, it sure af fooled me. The videos are very convincing.  Theres just too many videos of it to brush it off as fake right? Look at this. It talks about magneto proteins that can control neurons in the brain. https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2016/mar/24/magneto-remotely-controls-brain-and-behaviour
So its not far outside the realm of possibilities it seems. Look at this video too.

        <p>What if it becomes clear in 5-10 years, those who received a covid vaccine are (for example) 5-10% more likely to develop heart disease or some other complications. This can’t possibly be known at this point. But people keep citing how safe they are, full stop. I want to say ‘can you predict the future? What are the lotto numbers while I have you?’</p>

        <p>Any Italians or Germans here or someone who is really up to date (by the day!) with travel restrictions for those countries? I know France is open up for tourism for Americans starting tomorrow however can an American fly or take trains or buses from one country to another from France without being vaccinated? I know to go to France for tourism from American you can be vaccinated or just have a negative Covid test. I'd like to go back to Europe this summer but only if I wouldn't have an issue crossing over each country. I know all are a part of the EU however each are making their own rules regarding Americans traveling. My plan last summer was returning to Italy, France, Germany, and Austria. I know Italy allows Americans in for tourism on the Covid flights on Delta</p>

        <p>Hi, I am from the Netherlands. Unfortunately there is not just one rule for all countries. In Italy they require masks even outdoors. Crossing the borders is possible with a negative test not older than 48 hours (or vaccine). Depending on the country you come from or go to quarantine may be needed (and could change while you are here). 
Personally I will probably stay in the Netherlands or go by car somewhere and decide last minute.

        <p>Yes that is right. Although I heard people travelling by car without it. Some countries you can visit without a test but only for short visits. I believe at the moment I can go to Belgium or Germany for a visit of max 48 hours without a test, but it just changed so check well before you go.</p>

<p>Kind of like taking part in the snowflake thread of a sub dedicated to misinformation about a global pandemic that has killed millions of people. This thread specifically, only exists to coddle the sub's ignorant users to feel better about disagreeing with the world's leading medical experts based on cursory "research" and misunderstandings. <em>Then</em> you say the people in the satire subreddit dedicated to emulating <em>your</em> ridiculousness are only seeking instant gratification. If you would like more parallels, you may want to take a look in the mirror.</p>

        <p>From what I’ve read, Reddit gives subreddits (the mods) a lot of control of who they let in. Sometimes annoying as a mod who disagrees with you might just perm ban you, even if you follow the sub rules.</p>

        <p>My point is that you absolutely can self-diagnose.  That does not imply none or all.</p>
<p>The assumption that self-diagnostics being an all or nothing is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The normal way things work is if the 'problem' doesn't get better, or has hard initial symptoms, you seek further treatment in the professional realm.  But, to simply claim, "one cannot self diagnose" full stop, is a hypochondriac's statement.</p>

        <p>In the US, most places where you can donate blood are also doing antibody testing. There's a nationwide study going on. If you have antibodies then the vaccine won't do anything additional. That's all it does, give you antibodies.</p>

        <p>There's no reason to believe otherwise.  They use the ban hammer pretty liberally over there so I'd say that almost all the posts are legit. I've monitored the place from the beginning and they are starting to eat themselves a bit and accuse people of being Russian bots and whatnot as per their playbook but yes the short answer is that it's legit.</p>

<p>Look at the countries that don't have armed citizenry, like Canada and England. These are the places where government can get away with things like this, because they can put Johnny Flatfoot on every street corner for very little money with no repercussions.</p>

        <p>Anyone else get particularly angry when told to put on a mask? I'm from a Free State (MO) and I start to get real hot-blooded when I have to go somewhere that requires a mask. <br>
I get that it's their choice to require them or not, but I've even made a deal with the devil (I'm fully vaccinated, my choice, maybe regret it later, I'm a gambler), so that I can finally end the charade but no. Its starting to get infuriating. Anyone else feel this way or AITA?</p>

        <p>US Anti-tech legislation should be a slam-dunk, bipartisan win. There is no question that Big Tech is destroying our society. Social media and smartphones have done incalculable damage. As a people we are so enamored with technology that we equate technological progress with moral, psychic, or spiritual progress. We never stop to examine technology - did you notice how bureaucratic everything has become? With your phone in hand, you fill out a form to get food to eat, to purchase goods, to communicate.</p>
<p>Don't let the media FUD you on this one, or trick you into playing Red Team/Blue Team. Contact your representatives and senators and tell them that you support anti-tech legislation.</p>

        <p>I kind of wish I knew somebody like this IRL to better understand them.  My nephew is actually starting to fit the profile so perhaps I can try to get into his head one of these days.  I was also a bit let down by his dad's drift towards doomerism as well.  All 3 of us were on the same page back before the propaganda machine started turning everyone against each other.  Remember how you could just talk about this honestly with anyone before people were told what to think.  I want to say the shift happened right around this time last year when "we're all in this together" got scrapped.</p>

        <p>You're right, the new and seemingly most effective propaganda has been designed to divide. I'm sorry it's working on some of your immediate family members, fam, but that's what it was designed to do. Pepsi vs Coke. Ford vs Chevy. Red Sox vs Yankees. Dems vs Repubs. Jabbed vs unjabbed. </p>

        <p>Hello r/NoNewNormal. I recently came across this sub and i wonder: What are you about? </p>
<p>From the pinned post I only understood what you are not about. 
Looking through your posts, I understand you're against covid vaccinations. I am interested in the topic, but I only saw anecdotal evidence, which scientifically cannot be taken seriously. So here are my questions:
Do we have a real pandemic?</p>
<p>If no, why can't i get my usual treatment, as the hospital is handling only covid patients?</p>
<p>If yes, how can we deal with it without vaccinations we do trust? What should we do without vaccinations?</p>
<p>What could make us trust any vaccinations or other covid medicine?</p>
<p>Why should we not trust current vaccinations?</p>
<p>Please show the constructive path we can follow.</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

        <p>You would get a spectrum of responses on all of these questions, since we are a diverse group of people who haven't been socially coerced to think the same as everyone around us.  I'll try to provide reasonable answers that I think many of us would agree with here.</p>
<p>&rt;What are we about?  </p>
<p>We oppose any attempts to transform our society in response to the virus or any of the events surrounding it.  We will not accept "new normal" behaviors in our lives.  </p>
<p>&rt;Do we have a real pandemic?   </p>
<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus exists, but many of the events surrounding it have been manipulated to achieve the nightmare we've experienced the past 15 months.  The state's attempt to contain the virus were a vast overreach that, in addition to being ineffective, were actively harmful to the population.  It's my belief that had fear not been stoked by corporate media we would not have noticed any pandemic, but simply attributed any excess deaths to a more deadly flu variant.  </p>
<p>&rt;how can we deal with it without vaccinations we do trust? What should we do without vaccinations?   </p>
<p>Everyone has to make their own decisions on the safety and efficacy of being injected with this treatment.  Some of us here chose to accept the injection, but I think most chose not to because it didn't seem worth the risk of side effects for a virus we're not at significant risk dying from.  We are staunchly opposed to the idea of coercing people to take the injections either through force or social and economic pressure.</p>
<p>&rt;What could make us trust any vaccinations or other covid medicine?  </p>
<p>Vaccines that have been thoroughly tested and safely used for decades allow people to make an informed decision, but even trusted vaccines have side effects in some people and it should be up to the individual to take them or not.  Many people here see the mRNA treatments as experimental and potentially unsafe or even actively harmful.  Until we get more data I think a majority of us will hold off.</p>
<p>&rt;Why should we not trust current vaccinations?  </p>
<p>I've heard many people say they don't trust them because they were rushed out without sufficient testing and they would accept them after they have been proven safe.  Some do not trust the injections because they are not FDA approved, but only have emergency use authorization (again, an objection related to the speed at which they were developed, but with a bit more trust for authority).  Many are skeptical because the pharmaceutical companies have been granted legal immunity and cannot be prosecuted if their product harms anyone.  I'm sure there are even more objections that I haven't covered here.</p>
<p>As for a constructive path forward, I suggest we look behind us and see what has worked for us before. That is, freedom to make our own medical decisions without coercion.</p>

        <p>I know pfizer and j&amp;j have a history of crookedness. J&amp;J had asbestos in it's baby powder for decades and have numerous lawsuits for causing cancer. They've attempted many times to cover up cancer related risk.</p>
<p>Pfizer evade taxes and move overseas to dodge paying taxes which they owe over 30 billion, which could help with American health care system. You would think the manufactures of the vaccine would be about our health. I can't trust them.</p>
<p>These vaccines have a shadow over them and I can't be bothered with them.</p>

        <p>Early treatment of patients would be better than injecting healthy people.<br>
If you want to find out more go to the site of American Frontline Doctors or look at the interview with Peter McCullough on Vimeo for example. Both can be best found through a non-google browser. Or the documentairy Plandemic about the whole situation.</p>

        <p>Ok so what’s the deal with the spike protein I was on Facebook in a moms group and they asked if they are allowing young kids to get it once available- I asked a physician about the spike protein and she sent me a USA Today article basically shutting it down saying the spike protein isn’t toxic and the guy that said it is wrong - censorship is everywhere - it was apparent that the majority of moms said no they will not vaccinate their young children</p>

        <p>Wtf there is something in the air today. My BF and I were walking down the street, where our town happened to have a dining outside event. Almost no one (except employees) are wearing masks. Some random old guy walks up to us aggressively and says, "ARE YOU VACCINATED?" My BF, the good, just says, "No." Me, I say, "go fuck yourself." The guy starts ranting about how we have to wear masks if we're not vaccinated as we walk away.</p>
<p>I'm in PA... things are NOT going his way 😂</p>

        <p>So I came here looking for skeptics, but virtually every post is just people patting themselves on the back for finding something that confirms their biases. There is virtually zero skepticism whatsoever. Everyone should know by now that MSNBC is a propaganda tool for big D Democrats, but somehow people are posting articles from the Epoch Times like that contains any factual information at all.  Why no skepticism towards people you know are out to manipulate you? Why do people on here blindly accept a handful of emails that are deliberately taken out of context? I just don't get why there is even a group that is anti-science but calls themselves skeptics.</p>

        <p>It seems like most of the posts are skeptical of governments and corporations but not skeptical of sources as long as they attack governments and corporations. The people who own the most popular media groups are trying to make money, and they often do this by telling people the lies they want to hear, but the point is still to make money.  But none of them are providing real information, so blindly repeating what any of them have to say is not a sign of independent thought, it's the opposite in fact.</p>

        <p>Many of us have been here for a long time. Eventually even the most enthusiastic debater gets tired of trying to justify one's personal beliefs to random passerby, many of whom are just here to stir up shit.</p>
<p>You want to come and paint us all with broad brushstrokes. It takes time and energy to refute that, and for what? What is our reward for sending you away with whatever you're looking for? Spoonfeed yourself, or believe whatever you want in the absence of our assistance. We give no shits.</p>
<p>Those here in good faith can find whatever information they are looking for. Those who aren't, will never be satisfied with whatever we produce. People upvote content for their own reasons - as they say, "a retweet is not an endorsement." Nobody owes you an explanation of any kind.</p>
<p>This is simply our little home on reddit - the same right that every other subreddit enjoys, except those that align with the overarching politics of reddit don't have to justify their existence to outsiders.</p>

        <p>So here is the problem, I went through post after post and people who point out things that are true are downvoted and everyone who repeats the approved but non-skeptical narrative is upvoted. The info post says it's not anti-vax or anti-science and then the posts are all anti-vax and anti-science. Things that are clearly and deliberately taken out of context to trick those who won't bother to check for themselves are considered common knowledge, like Fauci's mundane and non-controversial emails that were released. When various media uses the phrase "leaked" it is both suggestive and false, and if someone starts a conversation with you by suggesting something that you know is false, perhaps those are not the people to trust.</p>

        <p>No... There's a reason clinical trials last <em>years</em> and not months. If you're comfortable taking it before they're completed, go ahead. All the power to you. But I won't be taking mine until 2023 when the trials are done. If I get COVID before then, i'll just isolate at home for 2 weeks.</p>

        <p>&rt;I would rather take the small chance of getting an illness from the vaccine than getting killed by Covid?</p>
<p>If you're under 50, the chance of serious illness is about the same for Covid as for the Vaccine. Covid is just so mild for everyone but the elderly! And once you get Sars-cov-2, you gain lasting immunity.</p>
<p>So good news, vaccine or not, you're likely already immune to Covid!</p>

        <p>The chance for serious illness for people under 50 is low but there is still a chance. Also, I can pass it on to older people who are at risk for serious illness. Why should I wait to get infected by COVID and greatly risk accidentally spread it to my parents/grandparents who would have a bad response to it instead of just getting vaccinated?</p>

        <p>then you're probably not the brightest star in the sky, are you? covid is real, but there was no pandemic. all these asymptomatic people that tested positive were only positive bc they did 40 pcr cycles. now the number of cases is dropping and the only reason is bc they lowered the number of pcr cycles. and people who died of homicide, suicide, etc were reported as covid deaths if they tested positive for covid. it's right on the cdc website in the comorbidities section. the bottom line is there is no reason to take a non fda approved vaccine when there are effective treatments such as ivermectin, steroids and blood thinners</p>

<p>For me the sample sized used in this too small to tell any difference. 35,000 were potentially used and instead they had about 4000. Of 35,000 people identified to be involved only 4000 were part of the research. 4000 people is a very small sample size.</p>
<p>Based on those numbers, 5% of pregnant women had adverse reactions and 1.15% had sponteaneous abortions. You start scaling that to the wider population and you are looking at millions. And not all of these people were followed through their entire pregnancy only a short snapshot of it.</p>
<p>They also use no form of control group either from the looks of it which would be a must for a study like this. They could have easily used a placebo and then compared results but they haven't. Its this kind of bad science that I object to. Its just experiementation at this point.</p>
<p>More of a 'lets see what happens' instead of a rigorously tested controlled approach which SHOULD be happening for these kind of studies. Especially when there are still so many unknowns.</p>
<p>If I'd have done a study like this at university I probably would have been lucky to get 50%.</p>
<p>The fact that it doesnt have any real means for determining if this is normal or not and is more a form of sociology study also rings alarm bells for me.</p>

        <p>&rt;4000 people is a very small sample size.</p>
<p>4000 people is actually pretty large. </p>
<p>&rt;Based on those numbers, 5% of pregnant women had adverse reactions and 1.15% had sponteaneous abortions. You start scaling that to the wider population and you are looking at millions.</p>
<p><em>calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic.</em> </p>
<p>Those percentages are not alarming. You can scale that to the larger population but you must be aware that miscarriages and spontaneous abortions already occur all the time for other reasons including natural ones.</p>
<p>&rt;They also use no form of control group either from the looks of it which would be a must for a study like this.</p>
<p>It's not really a must as you can compare the rates of adverse events to general population. </p>
<p>&rt;They could have easily used a placebo</p>
<p>Completely unethical to randomize pregnant women to either be in a placebo group or not, the purpose of this study is to observe whether there are harm from COVID-19 vaccines to pregnant women, however since COVID-19 itself is already a health risk you can not deny women the actual vaccine and put them at risk.</p>
<p>&rt;More of a 'lets see what happens' instead of a rigorously tested controlled approach which SHOULD be happening for these kind of studies. Especially when there are still so many unknowns.</p>
<p>Not every study design has to be a RCT. Observational studies are also very informative.</p>
<p>&rt;If I'd have done a study like this at university I probably would have been lucky to get 50%.</p>
<p>I don't know what this means.</p>

        <p>it's from a qualified local doctor that specialises in ADR's - Dr. Tess Lawrie (MBBCh, PhD) Director, Evidence-based Medicine Consultancy Ltd and EbMC Squared CiC Bath, UK.</p>
<p>She is literally someone who has more qualifications than you or I on the matter. If you weren't aware, the BIRD group has been created by hundreds of GPs and Drs across the UK to approve the use of Ivermectin for treatment in hospitals for covid as its currently not been approved for use with covid in many areas.</p>
<p>I wouldnt say the vaccine is a preventative as you can still catch and spread covid, its just your symptoms arent as bad. And there has been peer reviewed papers that have come out in favour of ivermectin. Which does the same job, is a tried and tested drug and is cheaper to manufacture than these vaccines.</p>

        <p>I looked into Dr. Tess Lawrie and the affiliated organizations she is with. It raises my suspicions that search results I see keep popping up for alternative medicine or naturopath websites.</p>
<p>It's also gives me little faith when I see grassroot campaigns advocating for a treatment drug rather than public research funding .</p>
<p>&rt;I wouldnt say the vaccine is a preventative as you can still catch and spread covid</p>
<p>The vaccines are proving to very effective in reducing cases, hence stopping people from catching covid and reducing transmission. It's not simply reducing peoples symptoms.</p>
<p>I'm not certain why people keep thinking the vaccines are not preventative, is it because of the breakthroughs cases? Would they also consider contraceptives as non-preventative for pregnancy because they can sometimes fail?</p>
<p>&rt;And there has been peer reviewed papers that have come out in favour of ivermectin.</p>
<p>And some that have not. Either way so far none of those papers have been advocating for ivermectin as a preventative medicine but as a treatment, which is different. Personally I'd much rather a have a preventative vaccine then having the population take ivermectin regularly (the only way a pill could ever be preventative).</p>

<p>1) Miscarriage and spontaneous abortion are interchangeably used. </p>
<p>2) You're mixing things up. You were talking about the 115 pregnancy losses and not the spontaneous abortions, which even then that statistic is recorded in Table 4 and is for before 20 weeks not afterwards. Of that 12.6% occurred.</p>

        <p>I assume you're a human and not a stick who can't bear fever for a couple of days and vaccination is definitely not for you.</p>
<p>Even a basic tetanus inj has its side effect, don't get one in case you get hurt mate</p>

        <p>I probably would have a few days fever from Covid if I would catch it and I try not to, so why would I consciously inject something that can not only cause a few days of fever, but also blood clots, even death and who knows what will happen long term? </p>
<p>If we arent brainwashed by now by government, media and society why do you think we would follow your suggestion in this Reddit group?</p>

        <p>I think one of the things that amazes me is that everyone acts like bloodclots aren't a big thing or a big issue.   </p>
<p>They are 100% a big issue. They can cause you strokes, heart attacks and are agonising if you get one in your leg and will leave you unable to walk. Like theyre serious shit. The risk of blood clots from covid is the same as the vaccine so why would I take the vaccine?  </p>
<p>The biggest threat to life from covid is bloodclots which the vaccine also causes so its not an effective treatment really.</p>

        <p>I agree, and the bloodclots that these vaccines can cause manifest in the brain too, a seldom and dangerous disorder.</p>

        <p>The rate of bloodclots from the vaccine is the same as covid. <br>
Blood clots can really really fuck you up. Its not just the fever or being sick.<br>
Bloodclots are the biggest concern if you catch covid</p>
<p>Why would you play down the side effects of bloodclots? when you are taking it to stop getting bloodclots as a worse symptom of covid and it could still give you bloodclots.</p>

        <p>They are experimental. They're not FDA approved (only authorized for emergency use) over a virus with a 99% survival rate. SM-102 is extremely toxic and is also not approved for human use and yet it is one of the ingredients. Oh and there are multiple medical professionals claiming it will definitely kill you within a few years. Yet you come in here and say "Just do it."</p>

        <p>If you've ever had Covid, and about half the US has (they just don't know it because Covid is so mild in people under 60), then you have antibodies and you don't need the vaccine.</p>
<p>Go donate blood and they will do an antibody test. If you have antibodies, you're just as immune as the vaccinated.</p>
