    <p><p>Like a guy or a girl who pretends to be over the top happy when their crush rejects them. To pretend that deep down they are not devastated. </p>
<p>Same way, the exhilaratingly jubilant theater these vaxxers put up reeks of the same. They know they have been had so they want us to join and validate their madness so they dont feel alone in the end when shit DOES/WILL go south.</p></p>

        <p>I too have wondered if their militancy in getting others vaccinated was due to an insecurity that maybe they made the wrong choice</p>

        <p>Donald Trump is responsible for Operation Warp Speed. Please stop playing partisan politics with what is quite obviously a concerted effort to destroy society at any and all costs.</p>

        <p>I dont like Trump either.  He is just a scumbag politician who will do anything for good optics as would Biden Obama Bush or whoever in power. The moment his opportunist whore of a daughter took that jab, I witnessed countless conservatives shit on her and her father for taking the jab. </p>
<p>I am talking about the Doomers who perchance happen to be mostly left leaning. They sensed an opportunity to oust orange man by citing cases and death toll. They dont care if he was instrumental behind the expedited development of vaccines. </p>
<p>Politics is a joke but most so called conservative voters (not politicians) have been mostly skeptical of the vaccine no matter who is in the office. Unlike the so called liberals.</p>

        <p>I do not care for Liberal Democrats in any way, shape, or form, and there are no voices in America that are not Liberal Democratic Voices. "Both sides" of the aisle are objectively incapable of leadership. QED.</p>
