    <strong>Why Are We Being Constantly Being Expected To "Prove A Negative"???</strong>
    <p><p>All we seem to see these days is edicts coming from on high - always in the tone of "we think", or "evidence suggests" - like these:</p>
<p>- "We are banning plastics 'cause <em>we think they make Gaia angry"</em></p>
<p>- "Gas powered car sales will be banned in 2030 <em>because evidence suggests they may cause 'climate change'"</em></p>
<p>- "You are locked down because <em>we think it might keep you from killing Grandma"</em></p>
<p>- You will wear a mask because <em>we believe it will stop the transmission of ThePlague... errrrr I mean ... Corona"</em></p>
<p>Whatever happened to having to provide real evidence before enacting public policy? Evidence that doesn't consist of cherry-picked data and biased "models" produced by people and organizations with vested ideological and financial interests in the outcome?</p>
<p>This charade isn't about "thought", it's about "feelz"!</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the concept of it being on governments and bureaucrats to actually have to prove that their ideas are sound before enacting them, and prove that the majority is actually in favour of them - especially when they negatively affect the life, liberty, and prosperity of millions?</p>
<p><em>Why is it on us to have to "prove them wrong"? It's ass-backwards.</em></p></p>

        <p>This is pretty old. The soviet and nazi regimes were scientistic and justified themselves based on the “sciences” of Marxism-Leninism and racism/eugenics. But you’re right, there’s definitely an extraordinary renaissance of scientism with a vengeance happening right now.</p>

        <p>The phenomenon you're referring to is what's known as "policy-based evidence-making". It's way more common than most people think, only everyone is focused on it now b/c the ramifications are immediate and disastrous.</p>

        <p>&rt; "policy-based evidence-making" </p>
<p>I'm keeping that one.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to try and trace back when this method of subverting actual science started to become common, and which interests/lobbies really made it mainstream.</p>
<p>As an early adopter, I nominate the "Environmental Movement", with their once-a-decade predictions of new agents of apocalypse.</p>
<p>The jig should have been up when the "hide the decline" emails were exposed, and the "hockey stick" model was discredited, but if anything, the Green movement has grown more powerful and have moved on to ever more outlandish and farfetched "scientific predictions".</p>
<p>Present the public and policy makers with actual science, or sensationalism, and they will choose sensationalism, every time.</p>

        <p>I'm most familiar with the field of health care and public health, but I'm sure it goes on in most areas where big money interests and big government interests converge. Pharmaceutical companies both lobby government directly, as well as indirectly by controlling well-funded NGOs that basically pay researchers to develop studies that are in line with their interests. Simultaneously, governments set up sock puppet NGOs through grant funding awards that direct researchers to produce studies that argue for more funding for whatever program it is that funds them. </p>
<p>It's one giant gravy train circle jerk.</p>

        <p>&rt; All we seem to see these days is edicts coming from on high - always in the tone of "we think", or "evidence suggests"</p>
<p>To be fair, in science it would be wrong to ever say "we know" or "proof dictates" because science doesn't work by proof or certainty, instead it works by mounting evidence in support of a theory. Science cannot work by proof because we are always limited by our ability to measure and quantify things via equipment. You test a theory through experiment but your experiment is fundamentally limited by your equipment and there is no such this as perfect equipment.</p>
<p>Even if there were such a thing as perfect equipment I'm not sure how you could ever provably devise a "perfect" experiment such that the results are guaranteed accurate, and even if that were possible, you are then limited by your ability to interpret the results.</p>
<p>Therefore you can't "prove" something in science because that would be absolute certainty and instead you can only say that the results of the experiment are <em>evidence</em> that a theory is true - <em>the evidence suggests a theory</em>. The question becomes, how strong is that evidence and how much can it be trusted? Most unscientific people don't consider this and treat all evidence - weak or strong, credible or incredible - as equal. Or worse yet, they treat evidence as <em>proof</em>. Proof and evidence are two very different things.</p>
<p>Regardless, and on to your point, even if you do have strong evidence from a credible source, you can still only say this evidence "suggests" a theory. It would be downright wrong to say it "proves" a theory.</p>

        <p>A thoughtful post, but I don't completely agree.</p>
<p>- That gravity exists, and what its affects are, is proven.</p>
<p>- That germs (and viruses) exist, spread, and cause disease, is proven.</p>
<p>- That the Earth orbits around the Sun, is proven.</p>
<p>I know that some schools of thought disagree on this, but the whole point of science is to "prove" something - to identify (and exploit) laws of nature for the benefit of mankind (and yes, as knowledge for its own sake).</p>
<p>To prove something, you require an experiment, and it needs to satisfy (IIRC) the following conditions:</p>
<p>It is repeatable, it is performed exactly the same way each time, outside influences are eliminated or accounted for, and it always produces the same result.</p>
<p>The BS being rained down upon us shouldn't even be dignified with the word "science" - it has more in common with phrenology, "animal magnetism", and astrology than with mathematics, physics, or astronomy.</p>

        <p>&rt;It is repeatable, <strong>baseline normal is established for known reasonably controllable intrinsic factors</strong>, it is performed exactly the same way each time, outside influences are eliminated or accounted for, and it always produces the same result.</p>
<p>Forgetting the establishing baseline normal part is the lion's share of why we're in these messes, with sudo science in general, and with all the sudo science surrounding the response to this virus.</p>
<p>This is probably deliberate, because if baseline normal was established in a population, the results of SARS2 infections would be significantly different, and it would be clear to everybody that it's a non issue.</p>
<p>Without establishing baseline normal, all that is definitely being measured is the fact that baseline normal hasn't been established.</p>

        <p>More importantly, essentially <em>everybody</em> in the world seems to have forgotten that.  It arguably might be literally the most important step in measuring anything.</p>
<p>One can have the most accurate and precise tools available, but if a unit under measurement has intrinsic interdependant uncontrolled (random status) controllable variables,  the only thing one can rationally imagine they're measuring are the effects of the random states of those uncontrolled controllable interdependant variables.</p>
<p>Practically ALL reports of statistics and effects and lack of effects and such in people with SARS2 infections can ONLY rationally be attributed to the random states of the known controllable interdependant variables, and nothing more.  Reporting how many people this or how many people that is sudo science.</p>
<p>In my observation, absolutely nobody on planet Earth is making ANY effort to try to control the known controllable interdependant variables to see where we actually stand with an established baseline normal.  Nobody.</p>

        <p>This is a completely fallacious argument. In science there exist both laws and theories. Laws exist to state simple phenomena that occur. Gravity exists is a law. Theories, unlike the popular use of the word, denote explanations of phenomena. Gravity exists because objects with mass create ripples in space is an over simplified theory. Laws are generally only used for simple results that can be easily quantified. </p>
<p>Also the idea that the whole point of science is to prove something is completely contrary to the scientific method, the foundation of all modern science. We observe and measure a variable, when possible we test it, and then we determine using statistics if the variable seems to fit what we predicted would occur. Even when it does, science states this in terms of current evidence supporting a hypothesis, never that the hypothesis is 100% true. This is because experiments don’t test laws, which we can simply observe. They test theories. Theories require mountains of evidence and are constantly retested. Only after significant evidence has been shown from multiple sources will a scientist begin to even tread on things like proof and certainty. </p>
<p>All that being said, it’s important to recognize that a theory with sufficient evidence can and should still be acted upon. As evidence on a topic grows the likelihood of contrary evidence being brought to light shrinks. This is why people want to act on climate change. Most reports indicate something in the range of 95-99% support of this in the scientific community. Some even go further and show problematic tendencies in the research of climate deniers, such as funding from large corporations. </p>
<p>Ultimately it’s all well and good to question the information you are told, but that questioning does not necessarily have to lead to disbelief. We can question data on COVID, the environment, or any number of other cases. And that’s fine. We should question. But disagreeing for the sake of contrarianism is just as dangerous as instantly believing everything we are told. We like to think that we are being fed BS because it seems better, but ultimately on issues like these we are constantly being told that one side or another is lying. Learn the basics of scientific language and do the research yourself as unbiased a manner as possible. Instantly believing something is a lie because it was told to you is the exact same thing as instantly believing something to be true. They are both equally dangerous and equally examples of pseudo scientific thinking.  </p>
<p>Sorry for bad formatting/grammar writing this out on mobile kind of sucks.</p>

        <p>The problem when they try to conflate science and public policy is that even if the public policy doesn't work they don't take it back. Banning plastic bags in some places doesn't really help climate change and plastic in the ocean, same as banning plastic straws, but they feel good so let's do it! The actual effects of policies like lockdowns/security theatre are never really taken into account and are only looked at as successes.</p>

        <p>Feelings are truth now. Listen to anyone under 30. Why did you do 'x' thing? "I just feel like x thing is &lt;reason&rt;". It's not just slang. It's describing how they are making decisions.</p>

        <p>&rt;Whatever happened to having to provide real evidence before enacting public policy? Evidence that doesn't consist of cherry-picked data and biased "models" produced by people and organizations with vested ideological and financial interests in the outcome?</p>
<p>This is nothing new. This is how they force circumcision on you</p>
