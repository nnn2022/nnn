    <strong>Aunt tried to give me the corona vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>These vaccines are dangerous and not enough studies have been done to test the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine. </p>
<p>There are many other common yet unproved chemicals in the shots.</p>
<p>In 2012, vaccines were withdrawn for the fourth time due to a brain disorder that caused life - threatening neurological damage.</p>
<p>It’s not the vaccine. If it is found out to be unsafe, a company like Gardasil maker Merck would have to pay for the hundreds of thousands of people harmed by it to get compensated by the government.</p>
<p>An independent investigation is still underway to find out how the 16-year-old became infected and where the virus came from. If it can be proven Gardasil did in fact cause the girl’s infection, not only will Congress investigate, but Merck could face stiff fines and criminal charges. That's just not something I can let into my body. </p>
<p>Today my daughter resisted getting the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (38-42% mortality) because the pediatrician gave her two oral doses, when the clinic's policy is only one. She was upset but after I talked with a pharmacist, we changed the policy. I believe the pharmacist called me at home to let me know the policy and I got the paperwork done for my daughter to receive the one-dose vaccine. At the clinic, the doctor told me there was only a 20-30% mortality rate with the oral version, but that didn't mean anything to me.</p>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<p>Do not vaccinate</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine is experimental and possibly dangerous, but it does not have a 38-42% mortality rate. There would be 40 million dead if that were the case.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if you are trolling or just uninformed, but there's a lot of problems with what you've written. Just off the top of my head</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>38-42%  mortality.  Please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no oral Covid vaccine right now. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merck is not developing  a Covid vaccine </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20-30% mortality rate for oral?  Again?  No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You talked to the pharmacist and you changed the policy?   I don't think policy means what you think it means.</p>
</li>
