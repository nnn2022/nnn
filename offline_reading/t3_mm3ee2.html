    <strong>A story from an old job that reminds me of the mask mentality.</strong>
    <p><p>In 2000 I got a job in airport security. I was being trained on the different stations. We switched every half hr to prevent fatigue. The stations were: Mag (the thing you walk through), X-ray, Wall (making sure passengers from departing flights went in one direction with no breaches), Hand Wand, And Random Bag Checks.</p>
<p>I was being trained on random bag checks. You pick a person, use a wand with a microfiber square on the end of it to swipe along zipper pulls, bag handles, etc. Then the microfiber square comes out, and is placed into a machine to detect gun powder residue. If you fly regularly, you've probably had this done to your bag. The person training, a teenager (half jokingly) said, "These microfiber squares are supposed to be sanitary with no cross contamination, but we drop em on the floor, wipe our asses with em, whatever".</p>
<p>That's the mask situation ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>Bonus segment: Years after quitting this job, I was flying and had my bag pulled for this procedure. MY BAG CAME UP POSITIVE!!!!! My brain immediately went back to the half assed training I received, and knowing that the square is always compromised ðŸ˜‚</p></p>
