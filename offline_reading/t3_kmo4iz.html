    <strong>Feeling very hopeless in the UK</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe its just browsing reddit too much but i cant help but feel more depressed and hopeless. Nothing is getting better at all, only worse. Tier 4 seems to be wanted across the UK, the new strain crap (another trend which will be forgotten in a month) many want schools / colleges closed (im not sure if the govt has plans) with college being the only thing i have left. </p>
<p>I cant keep living like this. I hate the waiting on what things they'll take next.  I cant see why the UK people still want this when our economy is being ruined and thousands plunged into poverty. I'd rather get the virus and take that risk then live in this sad existence.</p>
<p>Life isnt simply about  avoiding death</p></p>

        <p>I just started acting like it doesn't exist. I hope more people start acting normal soon bc this pandemic has affected me in very negative ways. I've missed out on a lot of opportunities, but I'm grateful there are still people in my life who aren't insane that I can talk to.</p>
<p>Try to find at least one person in real life you can meet up with and talk/hang out. The more people the better.</p>

        <p>I've tried, I've long since stopped wearing a mask (I'm exempt regardless but was afraid of confrontation, turns out no one cares). I've just been going to places i liked usually on trains which i liked but those areas are in tier 3/4 so i cant even go for a fucking drink anymore.</p>
<p>I just hope come march at best people come to their senses and realize a year of their lives has gone for nothing</p>

        <p>Honestly. Staying active is key, it really is! When I get too in my head I do some type of physical activity and it makes me feel better. Sending you Reddit hugs ðŸ¤—</p>

        <p>The good thing about living in the UK is the government's relative inability to enforce its decrees, so we have more flexibility to move around than people in China, France, and the urban US. Use it for activism.</p>

        <p>how do you know tier 4 is wanted across the uk?</p>
<p>every time i click on a video or an article about the new lockdown restrictions the like to dislike ratio is like 1:20 and all the comments are ranting. </p>
<p>outside no one seems to takes covid seriously as well(which is good).</p>

        <p>Wanted was probably the wrong word but it seems like tier 4 is constantly being talked about and those over at coronavirusUK relish the idea.  I know Reddit isnâ€™t real life of course but itâ€™s hard not to let it affect you</p>

        <p>We are a peasant bred, heavily subdued culture unfortunately.</p>
<p>However, more and more people are waking up! The advice for staying active, and minimising media is good advice IMO.</p>

        <p>this is what they want.  the government and the puppets in charge. </p>
<p>they want us depressed and miserable.  they want us to feel like there is no hope.  they are trying to break down our will mentally and spiritually.  they want us weak. </p>
<p>itâ€™s hard to NOT feel like giving up when every day we are bombarded with fear porn and sensationalism, and our fellow humans cheering it on instead of questioning it.  </p>
<p>the constantly hypocrisy and lies.  the gaslighting.  the never ending tier systems which just seem to be increasing (tier 5 really?!)</p>
<p>even writing all this makes me tired.  but quite simply we cannot give up.  we have to resist as much as possible.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. It is hard to live a normal life when my company is shut, you cant walk into a place not wearing a mask without getting looks (although i sometimes use a scaf instead to feel more rebellious) and all pubs, so-called 'non-essential' shops and cafes are closed.</p>
