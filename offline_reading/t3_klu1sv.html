    <strong>Vaccines for travel</strong>
    <p><p>Do you think there will be vaccines required for travel soon? I planned to go outside of the country (US) in January, but I'm worried that they would make me get a vaccine before I can re-enter. Is that possible or am I being paranoid?</p>
<p>I would rather cancel my trip than get a vaccine or be stuck in another country.</p></p>

        <p>You aren't being paranoid at all. I'm going to resist as long as I possibly can. If that means driving everywhere and never going overseas again, then so be it.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry to hear that. I was able to see my bucket list countries years ago, but definitely wanted to start traveling again soon. I had to cancel a much anticipated family trip to Canada in May. I had to scrap my 40th birthday plans even though it was just Hawaii. I've never been. We have another family trip (US) planned spring of 2022. Who knows if we'll be able to go without masks or a vax. Shit has been so crazy this year that I hold out some hope that people will snap and suddenly this will all go away and be relatively forgotten. But just like 9/11, that's pretty unlikely.</p>

        <p>This is so sad... I would drive everywhere too but there are already restrictions on where you can drive IN MY OWN COUNTRY. So much for our constitutional right to freedom of movement within and out of our country. There are some provinces and territories that are not accessible at all for travel for Canadians from certain provinces... I'll guess I'll just travel in my next life lol</p>

        <p>The closed border here is so sad. Nearby Canadians practically lived here and vice versa. We can't really travel the US freely either. Traveling is an automatic quarantine for many states, coming, going, or both. I drive to see my Gramma once a year. I didn't this year because of how extra complicated it was. She's 88 now and the only real mother I have, and I'm not sure I'll see her next year either. I'm going to try.</p>

        <p>Thank you❤️ It may not be as bad as Canada, but it certainly doesn't seem worth it to try. One of the arbitrary rules of traveling was that you could only stop in each state for a certain amount of time to avoid having to quarantine. Early on, my friend's 20 yr old daughter and her friend were forced to quarantine in FL (in a hotel) even though they live in a border state, Alabama. I think this was around spring break.</p>

        <p>I think they will be and it's insane.  I'm not against vaccines at all.  And when I have been fortunate to travel out of the country I did get some vaccines, but that was my choice based on the prevalence of the diseases on those areas, not a mandate by the airlines, or country I was visiting,  I used to make the argument that we don't need proof of vaccines for the flu, MMR, tetanus, etc to travel, but now I'm worried that will be the way of the future too.</p>

        <p>Vaccines won't even be available to most of the population in January, so I'd recommend going on your trip now. The longer you wait, the higher the chance of mandates happening.</p>
<p>My mom is currently visiting the U.S. from abroad and, in the middle of her trip, her country started requiring negative PCR tests for returning travelers, including citizens—and the test must be administered <em>prior</em> to flying back, in whatever country you happen to be visiting. Now she has to worry about getting tested here within 72 hours of her return flight, and pray the results come back within that timeframe. 😫</p>
<p>While we've lost a bunch of freedom to the new normal, the U.S. remains way less restrictive than most countries when it comes to travel. If you're a citizen I wouldn't worry about being able to come back, but I'd still travel sooner rather than later—you never know when any country will start requiring new bullshit overnight.</p>

        <p>Ok I like this perspective. I might just do that, hopefully I don't get stuck outside of the country. I'll talk to my family about it, I just want to travel at least once.</p>

        <p>Don’t worry you can always return to your country. They cannot keep you out, at least not at the moment. You should just do it and try hard to get around bs and always do your research. KLM (airline) emailed me saying my country required a negative PCR test and they will not let me board without one. I went directly on my government website, printed the info that it’s bullsh*t and went without a test to the airport. Guess who didn’t get asked for a test at any checkpoint 🙄 
Just do your research and be firm</p>

        <p>I don’t think you are being paranoid.  I think that it is being considered.  I don’t think this is a way to encourage vaccination.  People should have a choice in deciding what is the best protection for themselves.    I’m not popular here because I think preventative actions such as mask wearing, social distancing, and frequent hand washing are good things especially before we had a vaccine.  But I don’t think mandatory vaccines are a good idea.  People should definitely have a choice in what they put into their body.  None of the preventive measures have involved putting something into your body.  That is a big deal, vaccine reactions are real, there is a risk of harm to a person due to vaccine reaction.  Everyone needs to weigh the risk/benefit factor individually.  I work in the medical field and therefore work with immune compromised individuals more often than the average person.  So, I see the risk/benefit for me as less risk more benefit.  As I work with individuals who sometimes can’t be vaccinated for awhile due to medication, disease, or have no immune system due to chemotherapy.  So, I’m taking it so I don’t get them sick when they have a high chance of severe outcome.  Where I would probably not have much risk, if I got sick.  If I didn’t work with such a vulnerable population, then I might not get it.  Just do to the fact, I hate shots a lot!!! If there is a needle involved when it comes to me, ‘I usually feel much better’🤣.</p>
