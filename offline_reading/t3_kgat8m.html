        <p>I truly feel like the narrative will slightly shift in the media with an article like “Children who test positive are overwhelmingly asymptomatic and not hospitalized.” And then Fauci feels the need to make sure his two cents is heard by pulling some kind of advice/response to the headline from his ass. This has been the case this entire year. Some major article suggests maybe a certain thing has been overblown and within hours there’s a Fauci response where he hems and haws and doesn’t really say anything other than “eh let’s still panic.”</p>
<p>Like we can’t have hope or anything because that means Fauci won’t get on TV anymore. Gotta make sure we continue to wring our hands and destroy society over baseless speculation, low probability worst case scenarios, and whatever direction the “experts” say the wind is blowing that day.</p>
