        <p>My lifestyle was basically changed for me. Had to homeschool my special needs child for over a year and isolate her at home - not because I wanted to, but because she can’t wear a mask or tolerate the school’s mandatory weekly covid testing. We saw family whenever possible but our lives became pretty isolated without the ability to take her to school, stores, or restaurants. I had to wear a mask in my own home to get the therapy services she needed. </p>
<p>It wasn’t all bad, my husband got the ability to work from home permanently and we are now getting ready to move out of Commiefornia. I do not take it for granted that we are very fortunate to be in this position. </p>
<p>I will never forgive TPTB for their second-class treatment of disabled people or for their general gaslighting of the entire world. It makes me sad, sick and angry every day.</p>

        <p>Omg.  My life is a complete 180 degree change from the way it used to be.</p>
<p>In a weird way, and on a personal level, I've been having a great time.  Reading, studying, playing guitar, writing.  It's like a weird, long vacation.</p>
<p>If I only thought about myself, I might actually like these lockdowns.  But that would be entirely selfish.</p>

        <p>I have young children. Their schools were closed for long periods, swimming lessons no longer offered, one of their grandparents didn't want to see them. Church went "virtual," and when it did restart services there was nothing for kids.</p>
<p>I was forced to work from home (only went back for a brief period last year before the office was closed again, as it remains).</p>
<p>So, our lifestyle changed significantly.</p>

        <p>Yep. Wake up early, read all mainstream newspapers, check the prime minister's page. The flip the medal and search all new articles and stories from what's now called a conspiracy theories p(everything is either that or a white supremacist these days). Filter all the garbage from both side and process to make myself an accurate decent opinion. Best morning routine that everyone should do.</p>

        <p>I don't have kids so my life hasn't change at all during the lockdowns.</p>
<p>My coworkers have kids and they seem really stressed out. School is a gong show. It's open then closed, it's online, but there are issues getting online, blah blah blah. Leaving them home alone is illegal, so it's not like you can put them on a computer and then go to work (I'm sure most people are just ignoring that law and leaving young kids alone for most of the day). I'm not sure how exams work, but it's probably another pain in the ass. A coworker with shared custody of his child was complaining that his kid's mom dropped the kid off but didn't bring the laptop, so now the kid can't attend classes, and there's no way to get the computer because she's out of town.</p>

        <p>When this whole kerfuffle began, I was a travel agent. I spent 12-14 hours day with my clients who were about to leave the country, trying to return to the country and advocate for them when suppliers were not doing refunds. </p>
<p>My company transferred me to a different department because I was the most “adaptable” and was isolated at home for four months. Needless to say my mental health suffered and I went on a sick leave and then left the company. </p>
<p>Now I work two jobs at companies that I enjoy but I most uphold safety’s procedures. Wearing masks and washing my hands doesn’t bother me but being called a fucking moron almost every day because I ask someone to follow the company policies while shopping doesn’t feel too great.</p>

<p>I was a frequent traveller. Moved all over the world. I was always packing a suitcase for the next trip.</p>

        <p>Somewhat. Schools closed so I had both children home with me. Playgrounds, pools and indoor kid play places also closed so they were off the table. For the first month or so I was concerned so I didn't take the kids grocery shopping or to other errands with me. Since everything was closed we ended up getting a trampoline, zip line and various inflatable pools, slip n slides etc with the neighbors for all the kids to play on. Started watching the neighbors kid regularly who is the same age as one of mine since both his parents were stuck inside teleworking. At about 2 months I said fuck it and started taking the kids anywhere that i could again like groceries and the closed playgrounds. By fall most stuff was open and i found in person school so that was normal again. I did avoid in person dining for a while bc it was such a pain in the ass with limited seating and reservations required.</p>

        <p>The US government is skilled at manipulating data and skewing statistics. From what I can gather, it’s likely that a significant portion of that 600k death toll would have likely died anyways from natural causes, and they just happen to test positive for Covid because they make everybody take a test as often as possible.</p>
