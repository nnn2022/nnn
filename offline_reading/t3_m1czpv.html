    <strong>Why I joined this movement. I used to be VERY pro-lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>Like many people, when this virus broke out I had no idea what was happening and I got scared. I live in US Florida, and soon our government told us to stay inside and ‚Äú2 weeks to flatten the curve‚Äù so I complied. Sure at first it was nice to have days off, but soon I noticed how sad it was to miss out on certain things. After 2.5 months on quarantine inside I noticed that I can‚Äôt keep throwing away my life like this. </p>
<p>Th truth is 2 weeks to flatten the curve just didn‚Äôt work and it is time to accept that viruses exist and we can‚Äôt let it ruin our life. I wouldve been fine with lockdown for a few weeks if it actually worked but it‚Äôs just not realistic, you just can‚Äôt force everyone to stay home and humans naturally have the desire to go outside and interact we cannot keep on imprisoning ourselves. This is what pro-lockdown fanatics don‚Äôt understand. Lock down is not realistic and it doesn‚Äôt work, the sooner people accept this, the sooner they will realize that they should continue with their life. </p>
<p>My next point is that obviously the virus did not turn out to be as deadly as people thought. They will call me a conspiracy theorist but I know people who got a phone call saying they were positive for COVID even tho they never got tested. Tune out to the news and listen to reality, reality will tell you that people are surviving and the hospitals are not overflowing. </p>
<p>This thing is gunna be around for maybe 7 years and that‚Äôs reality, what are you gunna do about it imprison yourself for 7 years??? No it‚Äôs time to go back to normal and let people make their own decisions. It is ridiculous that people are criticizing de Santis and Abbott for simply allowing people to make their own decisions. How dystopian is this shit the people are being criticized for taking a vacation?!</p></p>

        <p>Yeah people always try to group us with ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt believe Covid is real!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou must believe the earth is flat too!‚Äù kind of bullshit labels and boxes they put us in. Maybe we just understand it‚Äôs just a strong flu and the science says it‚Äôs not as bad as they thought in the beginning. People very old and with other problems with their body should be careful but there is absolutely no way that lockdowns did anything but ruin lives. Just eat healthy, exercise, vitamin D and get good sleep and let your immune system do it‚Äôs job. Why is this so controversial? Why do people want to spray everything down with chemicals, hide in the dark and shoot up with experimental vaccines? It‚Äôs absolutely crazy. Keep doing you and enjoy this sub. We might be the last sane people on the planet. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>It really frustrating that there is so much actual "science" that shows that Covid is simply not that terrifying.  But when you show that, people are <em>suspicious</em> of it!</p>

        <p>When covid started I bought a bunch of storable food and waited for the bodies to pile up. </p>
<p>I live in the 3rd world in populated city where the medical system is totally fcked. So I pretty much was waiting for mass death and overflowing hospitals.</p>
<p>Then. 2 or 3 weeks in I decided to ride my bike past the free redcross hospital. It was completly empty. It was then I realized we were being lied to. </p>
<p>To this day the hospitals here have been empty. There was never a serious lockdown. By all accounts this area should have been totally ruined. Nobody I know has died or gotten seriously sick.</p>

        <p>But this is whats stupid - because YOU don't know anyone who's died or gotten severely sick, it must not be bad, right? Why the fuck do you think you're gonna hear about the stories of people dying? Suffering? Loved ones grieving? Do you think A) Journalists are allowed to just freely interview patients in the covid ward and B) do you honestly think people find any dignity in suddenly broadcasting their suffering on TV due to covid while theyre in a hospital bed? </p>
<p>I know two people, one in their 30s, one 40, who were healthy, got covid and they both went into a coma, organs failed, ultimately their brains failed and they died. One left behind a wife and kids. A neighbour, super healthy, runs every morning, had both her feet and both her hands amputated due to covid. My sister, who is a nutritionist and on the cleanest lifestyle for over 10+ years, got it and it was absolutely terrible - she still deals with symptoms months later.</p>
<p>So please shut the fuck up about it not being that serious, just knock on wood and count yourself lucky. Maybe where you are and in America the mutated variants haven't hit you yet, but im in the UK and we have mutated variants that are much more severe. Wait until that day happens where you are and keep saying it's nothing. This shit is mutating because people keep giving it a chance to spread. Every time the virus replicates, the more it mutates. The more people it will spread to, the more it will mutate. Why do you think they advertise a flu shot every year? I never take flu shots, and I'm not buying into the vaccine program, but man I'm not blind. This is real. Viruses are real. Its mutating and I can tell you first hand from here, the mutated variants are horrible.</p>

        <p>Something like 40% of the working population are required to produce/transport/sell food and other necessities, keep utilities running, be police/fire/paramedics, staff hospitals and other medical facilities, etc.  No lockdown is ever going to ‚Äústop‚Äù a respiratory virus that is already widespread even if most people wanted to participate.

        <p>We would literally have to close EVERYTHING down. People would have to buy food and water for at least two weeks or probably more in advance, you could not leave your home for LITERALLY ANY REASON and this would have to be enforced by laser-equipped drones that would literally kill you on sight or explosives strapped to your door that or something insane like that, because no police or military either honey. If the power went down or something broke or you got a medical emergency well that's just tough shit, you're on your own.</p>
<p>The virus is so easily transmissible that everything else is just a colossal waste of time and human life.</p>
<p>Sounds realistic? Of course not. That's why the politicians just waggle their arms around enforcing bullshit policies that don't do jack shit, so they can say "Look! We're doing something!" and then try to take credit when the virus is done doing what a virus does.</p>

        <p>It would have to be less than that, though not by a huge amount. As I recall, the "most essential" workers at the peak of lockdown were around 45% of the workforce, and that still included a lot of retail, construction and similar that could have been shut down had it actually been only two weeks, with proper planning.</p>

There‚Äôs not even official number about suicides since the begin of this shit. But COVID ? We have this every hours! Old people dying this is a disaster! 
But psychiatrist being overwhelmed and young people with no mental health issues before killing themself? Let‚Äôs add another quarantine rules and says everything is okay.

        <p>All of this was never about the virus and never about the science.  It was about <strong>flipping perspectives.</strong>  </p>
<p>A year ago, everyone would agree we live in a free country, and <strong>you can do anything at all</strong> that isn't specifically illegal (nothing is a crime unless there is a law against it) - - - but now, they want us to think the opposite - that <em>we</em> <strong><em>can't</em></strong> <em>do anything at all</em>, unless we are allowed to by the government.  An attempt to usurp our free will.</p>
<p>The government, in a democracy, works for the people.  By asking us to mask up, they are attempting to invert the relationship between the people, and their representatives in gov't.  Wearing a mask makes you subservient to those making the mask mandate - an inversion of the master/servant relationship that The People and Their Representatives have with each other.  </p>
<p>The liberties of the First Amendment, as written, are God-Given - not granted by the government, but endowed upon birth by the creator.  These liberties - Speech, assembly in groups, redress of grievances, practicing of religion, freedom of the press - have all been under assault for the past year with censorship of social media and media corruption/whitewashing, lockdowns, closing of churches, etc.  </p>
<p>These are all acts of war against our free society.  But the calls are coming from inside the house!  If you care about your freedoms, or have sworn an oath to fight against enemies, foreign and domestic, then it's time to bring the pain the only way they can't do anything about. . . . civil disobedience.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of power in these words, "Fuck No"</p>

        <p>I hear you. In the beginning I was also very pro lock down. If what they were saying was true we were about to see people start dropping like flies, and I sure as hell did not want to be a part of that so I stocked up and didn't leave the house for a month and a half. And then I waited.</p>
<p>While I waited, to ease my mind I figured I would start learning as much as I could about coronaviruses, the effectiveness of masks, how pcr tests work, etc, with the intent to keep myself and others safe with this information. Except... I started wondering what was going on. What I was discovering via my own research and what I was seeing with my own eyes did not align with what the media was saying was going on.</p>
<p>And then I started getting pissed. And I'm still pissed. The people who cry about believing the science know next to nothing about any actual science and it's infuriating. Their willful ignorance or virtue signaling or whatever it is is doing more harm than good but they refuse to wake up to reality.</p>

        <p>Our science is corporation owned. If they fucked up the spread to begin with where something far away in China was allowed to come way over here [or purposefully let it spread to the farthest corners of the world] why should I trust the bastards on anything including their experimental vaccine?</p>

        <p>7 years of this? I will be destroyed. My life span is shorter too due to disabilities. I don't think I want to live like this. I am not suicidal. I am willing to go anywhere to escape this shit.</p>
<p>I believe the virus is real and I followed all mandates like you. I still wear the mask. Nothing makes sense to me now with their extreme experimental vaccine, and more BS and contradictory information. I have been made afraid to even talk to anyone or walk by an unmasked person in a park. My life outside of husband has become so isolated.</p>
<p>None of the powers that be though how this would affect someone with severe disabilities and the poor and POC and those forced to work essential jobs have basically been screwed over. I get scared none of this shit is ever going to end. </p>
<p>Even the stupid vaccines don't seem to work, and/or will require endless "boosters" destroying and endangering health. I voted for Biden and now regret it. It was reluctant as hell. I always kind of hated both parties. I am realizing I am going to become a social pariah, and I am afraid in real life to tell anyone I'm not getting the vaccine and don't plan to. I probably can get a medical exemption, if I can't get one, no one can if needed. I am sick of how all of this was handled. Oh businesses have closed all over my small town, we drove down once upon a time thriving main street [tourist town], at least a third are gone. I will wear masks, still but I am going to start living some of life, but I know now I probably will have to embrace that I and husband are going to be on our own. There's no one to talk to out there about anything.</p>
<p>Vacations were few for me because I am poor but now I can't even go on a stupid day trip and enjoy it.</p>

        <p>I think it's perfectly fine to be initially pro-lockdown.</p>
<p>While a lockdown of a few weeks is a pain, maybe unnecessary, while there are so many unknowns it's a reasonable cautious approach. But after that enough knowledge surfaced which proved it's not the Ebola by far.</p>

        <p>I compare this whole situation to those videos you see of a crowd mistakenly panicking.</p>
<p>There was one in Times Square, when people heard a backfiring motorbike and thought it was a terror attack.</p>
<p><strong>A few people didn't run at all:</strong> Probably too reckless.</p>
<p><strong>A few people ran for half a block before seemingly stopping to confirm there was a threat:</strong> That's those of us who were happy to pause for 2-4 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Then there were those who just kept running, and running, potentially all the way back to their hotels/homes:</strong> That's the rest of the population during Covid - running, panicked, based on a confusing, unsettling month a year ago.</p>

        <p>We live in a very (relatively) safe and privileged society compared to the rest of the world. People who take that for granted usually end up going out of their way to embracing the mountains of hysteria over molehill issues. They‚Äôre so bored or literally have nothing better to live for, so they take up the struggle against the dangerous, high-survival rate virus because it gives them a sense of purpose, something to fear, and people to demonize and judge so that they can feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>Masks are the embodiment of this. Yes, there‚Äôs definitely a function and purpose for them, but just like how the threat of the  coronavirus was over-hyped, the over-reliance of masks has grown to an absurd degree to the point that masks are widely-misused. They‚Äôre stored improperly, washed ineffectively, and hell most aren‚Äôt even properly rated for preventing viral spread.
Masks have almost become 1 of 2 purposes to the general public:
1) a futile coping mechanism that gives the wearer a false sense of control over something they don‚Äôt really have much control over 
2) a ‚Äúmask‚Äù to fit into ‚Äúpolite‚Äù society with to either avoid making a scene or to simply be able to get or do essential things, like go to work or get groceries.</p>
