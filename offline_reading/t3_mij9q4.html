    <strong>"My" gas station dropped their mask policy and it was a bigger deal than I thought.</strong>
    <p><p>Today I walked into my usual gas station without a mask for the first time. I noticed their sign was down as I pulled up. I saw the cashier was maskless and smiling, so I just walked in. I thought it was going to be a nice little respite. On one level it was. But now I'm upset that it underscores the fact that I've been effected by these policies more than I realized. </p>
<p>This whole time I've been an "essential" worker on a federal installation. Despite my own (self-described) common sense and critical thinking, I have been a "go along to get along" person since the beginning. I'll wear a mask because the conflict is not worth the mild inconvenience even though I think they do very little if anything at all. But going along has become part of me. I hate it.</p></p>

        <p>I think a majority of people can relate. Our state will never give up the mask control.</p>
