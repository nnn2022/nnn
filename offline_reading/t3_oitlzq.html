        <p>I don't mean to be offensive by this, but how are you surprised? That's been the most prominently posted sentiment for the last month. I would say at least 30/day are posting about justice served, awww, and pics banning members here. </p>
<p>I know it's a little late this time, but you might check down the post history of the sub next time to see if you're parroting someone else. On top of that, this is liable to get you banned for 3 days. </p>
<p>But to address the point of your post, I've given up being a part of any "normie" subs. There's no point anymore. They're full of nothing but distraction and divisiveness and deception.</p>
