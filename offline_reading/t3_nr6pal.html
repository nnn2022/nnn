        <p>Could we MAYBE get a link to the article in question?</p>
<p>Because I'm reading this screenshot and I see nothing about Fauci admitting that HCQ works to fight CoVid.</p>
<p>It does... but I am seeing nothing here about him admitting it.</p>

        <p>If you remove the hype, there is no money in the treatment. Those drugs are in the medical equivalent of "public domain". A brand new vaccine on the other hand... Plenty of money.</p>
<p>And certain countries, like France, have laws that say that if a treatment is available then a vaccine is neither neither needed nor authorized (IMO it has to do with the fact that a treatment helps in the creation of anti-bodies, and a vaccine is injecting a weaker form of the disease for the same result, but I don't know that).</p>
<p>That is probably why the French government removed HCQ from circulation, a French lab that made HCQ burned down (freak accident), and silenced any doctor that said that it was a possible treatment (except Dr. Raoult that seems to have some sort of protection so they ridicule him constantly).</p>

        <p>I thought Raoults prescribed HCQ was already politically banned since several months now. In France HCQ was a prescrition free drug (OTC) until february 2020 and it was pulled just before the 1st wave hit hard in March 2020. It was known from Chinese research that HCQ had a positive outcome with Sars1 back in 2003 already.</p>
<p>If everybody would 've gotten HCQ and got early first line treatment, there wouldn't have been any overflowing hospitals nor mass deaths, so no reasons for robbing people of their freedoms to be held ransom in exchange for superfluous vaccines and digital passports. It's all engineered to have people scared to give up their freedom. It is why upto this day, after a year of deadly pandemic, people that test positive for covid are still said to do nothing but quarantine, letting the virus fester until hospitalization.</p>
<p>In the last McCullough video, he talks of mercenaries raiding pharmacies in Africa and burning down HCQ stocks, and worlds 2nd largest HCQ production site SCI Pharmtech near Taipei coincidentally burning down after a massive explosion.</p>

        <p>I wasn't paying enough attention at that time unfortunately.</p>
<p>But yes, when things started up in China (media reporting), the French was already starting on discrediting Dr. Raoult, since too many folks were listening to him about HCQ they banned it, they even made sure to have the equivalent of the CDC say that "It doesn't work, and in very dangerous." But when asked "Why now?" and not in the 75 years it has been on the market, and used to cure 100+ French Navy sailors of the aircraft carrier CDG of COVID, they never replied.</p>

        <p>Look at the date. He saw a preliminary study and passed it along for further review. Later on, an abundance of data showed it didn't actually have any impact, so the recommendations changed.</p>
