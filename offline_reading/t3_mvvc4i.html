        <p>Well, I was in medical school during the aids crisis, and we had multiple entire floors of people dying from AIDS, but no morgue trucks like we did back in the NY area last April.   Never saw anything like that. Now my colleagues see young healthy people who had Covid and now can't get close to their previous mile times- off by a whole minute.</p>
<p>The "flu" is caused by the influenza virus. CoVid is d from a corona virus.  It's almost like wearing masks and social distancing worked to diminish the much less contagious flu.  But what do I know, I'm just a doctor.</p>

<p>Horseshit.</p>
<p>First of all, a reduction of 99.99996% is hardly just "diminishment," you shameless propagandist.</p>
<p>Also, if simply hiding, wrapping towels around our heads or putting filters over our faces would cure the flu we would have figured it out a long time ago - especially 100 years ago when everyone tried that and it FAILED.</p>
<p>Even the Washington Post knew this a year ago.</p>
<p>https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/</p>
<p>The real answer: all flu cases have been deliberately misclassified as "coronavirus" because hospitals get huge payments for diagnosing "covid," and even bigger payments for hospitalizing for "covid"</p>
<p>Not to mention the insane authoritarian politicians who rely on the fabricated numbers to justify power grabbing tyranny under "emergency powers."</p>

        <p>I would agree with nearly all of this but I don't know how fair it is to call it deliberate - at least not for many of the hospitals and medical staff. I don't know anything about PCR  tests, but there does seem to be some folly in the guidance of how to use them. Idk, just saying it may not be intentional on part of the providers, but probably more on the CDC or whoever makes/instructs on how to use these tests.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to attribute malice to so many people, because most of them likely just want to help the sickly. I find it much easier to believe that it is a few giving deliberately misleading advice or instruction to the many.</p>
<p>Sorry if that doesn't make any sense. I'm super high. In any case, I think your overall point is correct.</p>

        <p>It's right there in black and white in the CARES Act. </p>
<p>https://www.hfma.org/topics/news/2020/04/increased-medicare-payments-for-covid-19-care-to-stretch-back-to.html</p>
<p>&rt;Increased Medicare payments for COVID-19 care to stretch back to late January
Apr 21, 2020</p>
<p>&rt;Medicare will provide hospitals and long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) a retroactive increase in payments for care provided to COVID-19 discharges as reflected on claims dating back to Jan. 27, the agency says.</p>
<p>&rt;CMS this week will begin sending a 20% increase in Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for patients previously treated for COVID-19 — far in advance of the latest quarterly update. The payments, as required by the CARES Act, will be automatically sent to previously paid providers that used the COVID-19 code (diagnosis code B97.29).   </p>
<p>&rt;CMS on April 21 will start to increase inpatient hospital payments by 20% for Medicare claims related to the care of COVID-19 patients on April 1 or later (diagnosis code U07.1).</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>https://www.foxnews.com/health/hospitals-medicare-patients-cost-coronavirus</p>
<p>&rt;Recent federal legislation, known as Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, has provisions that enable the government to pay more to hospitals specific to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;"The CARES Act authorized a temporary 20 percent increase in reimbursements from Medicare for COVID-19 patients to account for both anticipated and unanticipated increases in the cost of care for these medically complex patients," explained Dr. Summer McGee, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven.</p>
<p>&rt;As Badger highlighted, instead of getting paid the DRG rate, a hospital that admits a coronavirus patient will receive 20 percent more compensation than they would for providing that same care to a non-coronavirus patient.</p>
<p>&rt;"Imagine two Medicare patients, one with COVID-19 and another one not, with pneumonia in the same ICU. Medicare will pay, for example, $10,000 for the pneumonia patient who doesn't have COVID-19 and $12,000 for the patient who does," he surmised. "The rationale is that this provides a sort of rough justice method of making sure that hospitals that get a lot of COVID-19 patients also get extra money from the government."</p>
<p>&rt;Moreover, the Act established a $100 billion fund to aid hospitals – of which some $30-$50 billion is "used to reimburse healthcare providers, at Medicare rates, for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured," the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated.</p>
<p>&rt;Provisions in the act allow for hospitals to receive three times more per patient in need of a ventilator, multiple analyses have confirmed.</p>

        <p>God you people have no logic.  Look johnie, all flus disappear wearing cotton, yet covid cases keep going up!  Duuuurrrrrrrr!  Don't you know that covid is lighter or something so even though it is a corona virus as well it magically can get past that great mask!  </p>
<p>No it could not be that pcr tests are faulty and many flus are misdiagnosed as covid on purpose for money or not.  No could not be that!</p>

        <p>That’s a really big cover-up that would involve people across the globe. Even if it’s not intentional, it would require doctors everywhere (globally) to misdiagnose a strain of one common virus for a completely different common virus for well over a year now. </p>
<p>Isn’t it more likely that the COVID virus isn’t as easily deterred from sanitation and mask wearing as the flu (presented near the end of <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases">here</a>)? That’s not to say that preventative measures do nothing for COVID just that it’s more effective against the flu.</p>

        <p>Seriously.  It's pretty obvious that the medical experts who said that Covid was much more contagious were right, and the changes in behavior slowed down Covid but almost entirely stopped the flu from spreading.  And, like people have tried to explain, the flu numbers from past seasons are an estimate that includes many undiagnosed cases.</p>

        <p>Covid goes up for a lot of reasons, including gathering indoors without masks.  It's really not just "red state types."  </p>
<p>The flu isn't magically immune to no masks.  And the reasons for the low flu numbers is more complicated than just masks.  I'm sure scientists will study all of the evidence, but it's probably a combination of a lot of things.  The flu didn't get spread around in the fall through air travel.  Flu vaccines help keep the R0 lower.  There are some theories about dominant viruses based on what usually happens with flu strains. People with the flu are contagious for a shorter time before they show symptoms, and everyone is more considerate about not intentionally sharing their germs, from kindergartners to co-workers to family members.  People who are more vulnerable to the flu are obviously more protected.</p>

        <p>The only obvious truth is that covid's basic reproduction number (R0) is a lot higher, which means it's a lot more contagious. You can simply look this up on Wikipedia. Or you guys think the whole world is lying to you and everything was shut down for over a year for no reason?</p>

        <p>Don't tar us all with the same brush. The only thing I'm certain of is that I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't trust the media, and I don't trust my government. If that makes me crazy then so be it. But both have been known to spread malicious lies, usually in the furtherance of some kind of agenda, usually a financial one. I don't have some grand unifying theory for all of this. I wish I did. This sub is the only place I can voice my concerns without being banned. So naturally, the more extreme conspiracists are also going to find a safe haven here. But you'll find that the vast majority of us are just weary skeptics.</p>

        <p>Of course, it's both.  Covid's basic reproduction number (R0) is a lot higher, which means it's a lot more contagious. You can simply look this up on Wikipedia. So masks and social distancing stops less contagious viruses but don't do enough to completely stop a virus that's 3 times more contagious.</p>

        <p>It's not an "actual answer", it's a statement about the formula for how many people die. The numbers you would plug into that equation would almost certainly be based on propaganda such as 40-plus cycle PCR tests of "contagion" and hugely falsified (CARES act incentivized) death tolls. </p>

        <p>Past decade here: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html</p>

<p>Even using proper data sources it is very hard to get people to see the whole picture.

        <p>Flu being down 99% is absolutely questionable, and no doubt the numbers are fudged a bit, but i think a simpler, less conspiratorial answer to why they are down so much is that both flu and covid are primarily dangerous to very old people, and right now hospitals are extremely eager to report covid deaths.</p>
<p>Covid is definitely more contagious and so basically anyone whos at risk and doesnt seal themselves in a tomb of it is going to get into contact with it at some point</p>

        <p>I don't think they stop covid, they prevent you from spreading it. So like if you cough into a mask the covid gets trapped in the mask. But if someone with covid coughs onto your mask you can still get it. It's not super effective, but it's the simplest we've got. Then at the same time you've got people not wearing the masks properly... I'm not a specialist so I can't really say, I'm just trying to keep my sanity in tact.</p>
