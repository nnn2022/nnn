    <strong>My Take: This is all about business</strong>
    <p><p>When you've heard we need to get "x" percentage of the population vaccinated for herd immunity, what  the translation really is:</p>
<p>This is the percentage of people business is willing to lose as a customer base. </p>
<p>Think about it. Could business operate if 50% of its potential customers were unvaccinated and they enforced rules that they will only do business and or hire those who are vaccinated?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Our society, from a business perspective, can't enforce vaccine mandates as long as the percentages of those vaccinated are too low. </p>
<p>However, once a certain percentage is reached, if it ever is, they can and will. The push to vaccinate has NEVER been about your health or the health of society. </p>
<p>It's always been and always will be about money, power and control and you can't control a society that is 50% vaccinated. You get to 80%? That is an acceptable but difficult loss but acceptable nonetheless.</p>
<p>Don't be deceived. I see the emails to people I care about from their corporations pushing them hard to be vaccinated. What those email recipients who aren't being vaccinated don't realize is by not caving to pressure they are preventing business from doing what they desire to do...mandate vaccinations.</p>
<p>I used to laugh when I saw people use this hashtag on Twitter for 4 long years. I no longer laugh. </p>

        <p>It's all about who holds majority in your area.</p>
<p>Mine has Cult of the Mask and Vax in majority, and there is no choice. </p>
<p>At least with the 12 f'ing months of 'mandatory indoor masking' measures gone, their hold is now broken as opposing political businesses can now be rid of the BS and we have choice again.</p>
<p>The same will most likely occur with the Vax and Vax Passport,  but since the Mask is the only visible item, most businesses will able to get away with not forcing it on their employees.</p>
<p>This is more of a political battle right now, over human rights vs FEAR, than covid19 threat.</p>

        <p>You're right about this. This is a STATES issue if you are in the US. </p>
<p>There are states you wouldn't want to be in and some you would. I would move in a heartbeat to one that was flattering to my position on this issue.</p>
<p>Florida is leading the way. That state should see an influx of US refugees and probably already has. I would love to be there. </p>
<p>I have no faith in the feds. That's controlled by a party that is arm-and-arm with those that wish to keep this going. </p>
<p>Fauci said there might be two Americas. I actually hope he's correct. It's time. Just let one half of this country LARP this until the end of time and let the normal people live their lives on the other half. I'd prefer that to how it is right now.</p>

        <p>Yes, except the Cult of the Mask types crap where they eat, and turn their areas into cesspools, 'get woke and go broke'  then instead of sleeping in the bed they made.. guess where they escape to?  </p>
<p>Sensible and clean conservative areas.</p>
<p>Example CA -&rt; TX</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s totally about money. Recipients of flu vaccines have been declining for years. This â€˜vid19 campaign targeted the most at risk group first, the 65+ crowd, which are mostly doomer retirees with fat nest eggs.</p>
<p>Then the push to have the majority of the population drinking the vac cine tea &amp; play the support the economy game, while frequent side effects are causing womenâ€™sâ€™  periods to be more active earlier &amp; later in life, allows for potentially more fertile women to have children which closes the aging workforce gap and helps maintain the bigger agenda. </p>
<p>All this might sound like a stretch, but my a few finance/economics/health professors &amp; my class of 2020 university classmates discussed crazy â€˜what ifâ€™sâ€™ like this prior to graduating, and the majority agreed on the financial tactics of it all.</p>
