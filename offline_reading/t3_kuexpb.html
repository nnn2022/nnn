    <strong>The quick vaccine has not given a chance for lockdown skepticism</strong>
    <p><p>Vaccine development was too fast for covid. Moderna mRNA-1273 started trials started in March and got FDA emergency use authorization in 23 december. Pfizer BNT162b2 started development in 10th Janury 2020 and got conditional permit in the UK in 2nd december 2020. </p>
<p>It went too fast.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem for skepticals? Because, if, for every disease, it gets clear that there is a rushed vaccine or serum, it gets difficult to argue that we have to live with the disease, because a solution will appear before fatigue makes sense.</p>
<p>In the lockdown cycles that started in november-december, there was much lesser compliance and people were not giving a shit. The belief in lockdowns began to crack everywhere. Police, in most situations was looking the other way. Businesses started to structure themselves in speakeasy systems. Lockdown rebellions were starting.</p>
<p>But, in December, when the vaccine rolled out, the rebellion stopped. I think that there is a belief that the next months will be a "final effort" and, at most in April, this nightmare will end.</p>
<p>So, the idea of living with the virus, even though lockdowns helped very little, did not have a chance to grow.</p>
<p>If lockdowns had no end in sight, things would have been far different.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>I’ve thought the same thing, that these quick vaccines will justify future lockdowns for whatever comes next. It’s set a precedent. But it seems like a lot of people aren’t interested in the vaccine for now and that the vaccine isn’t getting people back to normal anyway which makes me slightly hopeful this kind of response won’t be viable in the future.</p>
