    <strong>Red-pilled for life</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Edit; Will be taking a break. I'll come back and add in the rest I wanted to add in. Visit the very first link for now, it has more than enough IMO.</strong></p>
<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>Upon multiple requests, I will be posting a dump of various links and resources you may find helpful in these insane times. I plan to lay low due to a number of reasons. I won't elaborate for my sake but my account has already had suspicious activity regarding some of my links and posts.  It's insane to think that right now I would have been preparing for college classes, and now I'm preparing for arguably the worst point in human history as we speak due to mandates at the schools I once wanted to go to, and potentially worse.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nojabforme.info/"><strong>https://nojabforme.info/</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="https://facescrimesagainsthumanity.club/">https://facescrimesagainsthumanity.club/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The top two are ones I highly recommend. <strong>The top one in particular has the most amount of direct government documentation that covers this.</strong> Download it, he has a function that allows for you to. It's extremely hard, if not impossible to argue this against flimsy anonymous Reuters accomplices nor MSM articles. It's not substantiated. If anything, the wealth transfer and the decimation of the middle class should speak volumes as to who's being motivated by what.</p>
<p>Here are some others;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/Agenda21.pdf">Agenda 21</a> - Published by the UN on June 1992<em>Section 6.11;  While direct health costs will be substantial, they will be dwarfed by the indirect costs of the pandemic - mainly costs associated with the loss of income and decreased productivity of the workforce. The pandemic will inhibit growth of the service and industrial sectors and significantly increase the costs of human capacity-building and retraining.</em></li>
<li><a href="https://eeca.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/depopulation20as20a20policy20challenge.pdf">Depopulation</a> - Published by the UN on Oct 1, 2020Go to page 7, and note Table 1. Note how COVID is stated to have started in <em>2019,</em> despite the WHO having declared this a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Not sus at all, right? Also note the negative literature regarding the increased ability to be an individual.</li>
<li>Georgia Guidestones - [<a href="https://egaonline.com/sites/default/files/The%20Georgia%20Guidestones.pdf">1</a>] [<a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-fXumsXpSyaieB2s4/georgia_guidestones_djvu.txt">2</a>] [<a href="http://pdf.amazingdiscoveries.org/Georgia-Guidestones.pdf">3</a>]Note specifically the very odd number in point 1. Why this particular number? And how would they know such a thing so early in time? Not planned at all, right?</li>

<p>If I have time, I will periodically update this as I find more info. I will also try my best to add archived links if I have time, but please note I am currently trying to prepare for what's next. Unsure on what that is? Go to the WEF and on here query Dark Winter/Cyberpan. Stay vigilant, I seriously doubt those in charge would go to such measures only to lose. For those of you who are religious like my parents; feel free to keep praying, but also note that if the stories like that in 1984 and BNW come true, we're heading for very dark times.</p>
<p>I do not plan on saying anymore moving forward.</p>
<p>I have lost a lot of sleep over this. I need to go back to focusing on other things for the sake of my mental health and living a balanced life. This is primarily why I never really dug into news anyhow, it was only when I received word of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2ydzi4IDyAhVI054KHZobCPQQFjABegQIBBAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu%2Fcoronavirus%2Fstudent-faqs-covid-19-vaccine-5-4-21.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AxKI4LHQk9btNk0HktEh-">this</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NorCalLockdownSkeptic/comments/okq1zo/uccsus/">this</a> that I started investigating, as well as the fact that I live in. Yeah LMFAO. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ooj2dt/mic_drop_moment_right_here/">Here</a> is a spark of hope though.</p>
<p>Good luck, stay sane, and never forget all that makes you human. We have the innate ability to be sentient beings, in touch with our thoughts, emotions and bodies that the depraved cannot take away from us, no matter how much they may try. We as people can unite through love, not hate, fear-mongering, or lies. Healthy individuals feel no need to impose themselves nor their ideologies onto others.</p></p>
