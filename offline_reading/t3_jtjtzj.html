        <p>I think we're a step away from people acknowledging the depopulation agenda by the eugenics in Geneva... This is essentially why the covid hoax and climate change hoax are happening in the world.</p>
<p>The resources on earth are finite and the population can't keep growing without causing a drought few decades from now, so they will slowly start killing off people with vaccines and health care refusal in advanced economies, and "food shortages" in third world countries... In the not so distant future, if these deranged fucks win, majority of the planet will have restricted use of carbon fuels because of "global warming".</p>
<p>These psychopaths in Geneva want to push global socialism/communism not because it's good for everyone like they claim, but because it's the easiest way to control and kill billions of people.</p>
<p>What did communists use before candles? Electricity...</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the mass brainwashing through the Dept. of Education has the general population massively hypnotized by the left-wing propaganda the government is selling them.</p>

        <p>Yes and no... Everything living thing on this planet has some sort of survival mechanism, even plants. Once the mass realizes that private property rights and freedom will be gone in a socialist/fascist environment, they will change their tunes and attitudes... Look at history for examples, every single time fascists came in, mass bloodshed happened and eventually they fell, it will be the same now but on a global level. Asia won't push back and they will get depopulated, Europe probably won't as well, but North America won't be living under fascism, there is too much resistance to it now already, and it didn't even start.</p>
<p>Once the mass realize this whole "sustainability" and "green" bullshit being pushed globally is about depopulation, tyranny will then lose. Could take years maybe, it will certainly get ugly before it gets better, but in the end, they will lose... Everything with a beginning must have an end. Most people don't see what's coming until it's too late, but when it comes down to the government taking away your property rights, they will kill and even die to protect the cause.</p>
<p>Socialism/fascism never worked and never will, it's a bankrupt business model... You can't preach collectivism as an economic or societal model, it's extremely flawed. Could education or health care be collective in a thriving society? Absolutely! But not society or the economy itself.</p>
<p>We will be fine brother, it'll just be a lot of pain, misery and death if we don't defeat the cancer before it gets too big... Get involved locally, get pro active and take it as seriously as the guys who are trying to depopulate earth</p>

        <p>What you miss, Muffinsun, is that no one is calling for the economy <strong>as a whole</strong> to be made socialist.</p>
<p>Only the parts of it that do not properly respond to supply and demand or where demand never decreases: Health care, basic food and clothing, basic shelter, etc.</p>
<p>In the cases of most of those 'basics', people are not calling for capitalism to be dropped for them. They are calling for proper <strong>living wages</strong> that people can survive and thrive on and proper social assistance programs to help those who cannot work like myself who have mental disabilities, physical disabilities, etc.</p>

        <p>Too bad the incentives for improvement, innovation, and convenience go away when a product or service becomes 'free' -  where the highest standard is only determined by the lowest common denominator.</p>
