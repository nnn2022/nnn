    <strong>Help someone try to understand</strong>
    <p><p>I am really really trying hard to understand the viewpoints of this subreddit, but quite frankly Im struggling because there isnt too much actual discussion that goes on between the memes. I was hoping someone could help me understand maybe what the main arguments are? Particularly, Im curious about the first and most basic questions that you should ask, who what where why. Who is “they”? if coronavirus isnt what people say it is then what is it? Who has both the motive and somehow the means to lie about this and what do they gain?</p></p>

        <p>corona/blm is a chapter in the global elites playbook for tightening their grip, removing rights from bottom 99%, removing money from bottom 99%, transferring that money and power to top 1%. its also for great reset, green new deal, other communistic shit.</p>

        <p>My argument is simple:</p>
<p>Lockdown restrictions must match clinical risk to be clinically justified. Locking people who are at near-zero risk of death or serious complications does little to prevent COVID-19 deaths, as those aren't the people who are dying. But it does mean the deaths of tens of millions of other people who would have lived if we didn't lock down. And I did say tens of millions. <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/09/1072712">That wasn't a typo</a>.</p>
<p>One could say "listen to the science!" But epidemiology did not begin in March 2020. Prior to March 2020, general lockdowns were universally condemned as brutish, lethal, and unnecessary. What changed? Tech barons figured out they could make trillions if they were the only ones able to buy and sell, and censored all other information (including the Great Barrington Declaration; an absolute must-read for anyone who likes their science fresh from the tap).</p>

        <p>&rt;Who is “they”?</p>
<p>Of course it's hard to answer something like that without context, but I believe you are referring to the Globalist Elite. The ones who head the "Liberal World Order", the term used by the <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-06-14/liberal-world">Foreign Affairs</a>, the magazine by globalists, for globalists. As you'll see by what little we can read of the article and by what you'll possibly research, they see nationalism, patriotism or identity as villains, to be fought with any means necessary, so they can implant the infamous New World Order (or as we can refer now, New Normal), a world where the Nation-States bow to their tecnocratic overlords (that mentioned elite).</p>
<p>You can't simply destroy the nations and tell them to obey you; that's why you must destroy them first: hyperdiversity, to crush any kind of identity under divisionist policies; Economic destruction, with ecological and sanitary false premisses, so you only have to deal with impoverished people and weakened countries; atomization, by destroying the family unit and communities, leaving individuals to be enslaved in social media; and finally bread and circus, with UBI and cheap entertainment, where you can consume shit with minimal impact to Our Lords' resources.</p>
