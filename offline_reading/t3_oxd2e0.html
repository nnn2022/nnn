    <strong>A little confused about the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>If the vaccine does not lower the risk of contracting the virus, and does not lower the risk of transmitting the virus, is there any reason getting the vaccine still protects other people? I fully understand it is highly effective at preventing severe or fatal covid cases.</p>
<p>If you want to argue without facts, are an anti vax or pro vax extremist, I will simply block you. </p>
<p>This is a simple question, I’m not interested in anti vax conspiracy theories or condescending blind loyalty to the vaccine.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting anyone not get the vaccine, I just want to know if I’ve missed something. </p>
<p>We know now that vaccinated people are contracting and transmitting at high rates, especially because of delta. I am not interested in debating this fact. The statistics have come in, we are no longer guessing.</p>
<p>EDIT / the censorship seems to be continuing here, multiple responses that I cannot see.</p></p>

        <p>Ok they just make it up? I literally posted this wondering the same thing a week ago and it was explained that positive samples go for further analysis.</p>
<p>It’s one thing to think covid is being used to push the great reset/new normal agenda.</p>
<p>Its a whole other thing to think the whole virus is fake…. It is a real virus and they are testing the positive samples to identify strains</p>

        <p>Also this is how they "discovered" "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>They do, that’s why they original numbers on the pandemic are off, they recalled the method for testing because it gave false positives, and deaths would be counted as covid deaths.

<p>1 - The vaccine prevents 100% of Covid Deaths (0 vs 5)</p>
<p>or 2 - The vaccine prevents 0.022% of Covid Deaths (5 vs 21888)</p>
<p>So the numbers show a small benefit...</p>
<p>Now look at the study more closely... with a skeptical eye looking for where the salesperson is hiding the flaws.</p>
<p>Take 40,000 people, and follow them for a month, some of them will die. Because thats life.</p>
<p>Back of a napkin math calculation:</p>
<p>In 2020, the USA had a death rate of approximately 8.2 citizens per year per 1000 individuals. Therefore, in a group of 43,783 people we might expect 360 deaths. 2 equal groups, therefore we might expect 180 deaths in each group.</p>
<p>I think the Johnson and Johnson study only reported on the subject's status at 28 days after injection. So 1 month.</p>
<p>We're anticipating 180 deaths in a year - in 1 month = 1/12 of a year - might we anticipate 1/12 of that number of deaths? Maybe 30 deaths, 15 deaths in each group.</p>
<p>Its an estimate. Perhaps deaths are seasonal? Perhaps people behave less riskily when they are participating in a medical study? Perhaps 15 deaths in each group is not realistic, but we should expect a few, surely?</p>
<p><strong>And very importantly, we'd expect a similar number in both groups, jabbed and non jabbed.</strong></p>
<p>So now look at the full data set.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882225/</p>
<p>To quote:</p>
<p><em>three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related).</em></p>
<p>Now because if the group demographics were equally weighted, (i.e the same number of 85 year olds in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups) you'd expect similar background mortality in both groups.</p>
<p>But we don't.</p>
<p>We see a background death rate of almost 4 times higher in the non-vaccinated control group compared with the vaccinated group (11 vs 3)</p>
<p>This is pretty much the same number as we see in the "Covid deaths" (5 vs 0, as opposed to 11 vs 3)</p>
<p>This is a statistical abnormality.</p>
<p>The control group seem to be more sickly / vulnerable.</p>
<p>A fair test would require the two different groups to be as similar as possible, the only thing being different is the jab or no jab - then we can tell what effect the jab has. If your control group contains more vulnerable people, with other serious medical conditions, the trial data suddenly becomes a lot more questionable.</p>
<p>A supplementary appendix contains more data:</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544/suppl_file/nejmoa2101544_appendix.pdf</p>
<p>page 35 age distributions, page 43 comorbidities.</p>
<p>Do jabbed people transmit the virus? - yes, they do.</p>
<p>Should you be afraid? - no.</p>
<p>Would I recommend taking the jab? - no, its not been tested sufficiently, we can't answer your question - because - you know - its not been sufficiently tested. </p>
<p>plus its method of operation is clearly dangerous.</p>

        <p>Well that’s fantastic 🤪 Thank you for writing this, this is very helpful albeit depressing. 100% vs .022% is an insane difference. I knew statistics can be misleading but that’s ridiculous. And I get that percentages won’t play out perfectly in small groups but what happened to the 99% of unvaccinated people survive covid statistic? That would be 1 in every hundred dead right? Meaning 210 people should’ve died? That is a hell of a lot more than 16.</p>

        <p>16 people did not die of coronavirus. </p>
<p><strong>5 people died with a positive coronavirus test</strong> </p>
<p>Un-jabbed people were dying 4x faster than the jabbed group - of other causes - meaning the control group was not as healthy as the jabbed group. </p>
<p>A cynical person might conclude they snuck in some terminally ill patients to make the jab look more effective... considering the insane amount of money on the table and a global push to implement vaccine passports... </p>

        <p>You’re right. At this point it only offers individual protection from severe or fatal cases and it DOESN’T protect others. We will keep mass testing and continue to see fully vaccinated individuals test positive.</p>
<p>However the media will continue their ‘you need to protect others, don’t be selfish’ agenda despite it NOT BEING TRUE as you said in OP. Most people will continue parroting the selfish agenda without acknowledging transmission and infection among vaccinated. </p>
<p>We’re past the point of people thinking…. They are so conditioned that the V is the only way back to normal, they will attack anyone who doesn’t want it, rather than criticise the government who are imposing the restrictions</p>

        <p>Thats the thing. The msm keeps saying that u need this to protect urself and others. There is no proof that the vax will protect anyone.  Only time will tell. The way i see it its bullshit.  My opinion.  I ate dirt when i was a kid. I am out in the elements. I havent stopped during this episode. I dont take pills for the sniffles or sore throat.  Think there lies the problem. Everyone runs to the doc for every thing. Thats not how the body works. People have been programmed by tv. All i can say.</p>

        <p>Here's the fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>Because the Therapeutics (mistakenly referred to as vaccines), allow the infected to enjoy a much easier ride through the Covid experience, they may not even know they have it. Now the unvaxxed, on the other hand, know damned well that they have Covid (assuming they've done nothing to mitigate the symptoms or taken Prophylactic measures). Their symptoms will have them bedridden, with little opportunity to spread the virus to others. The 'Vaccinated' on the other hand, will go about their day, unaware of their infection and spread Covid joy everywhere they go.</p>
<p>Plus, there's the added benefit of the 'Marek's' effect, of simply ameliorating symptoms, rather than destroying the disease. That's a fun one that's going to cause a whole lot of chaos in the coming months/years.</p>

        <p>In short, I believe that you have got the main points.</p>
<p>I think the UK data shows that the vaccine is responsible for a reduction in hospitalisations and severe symptoms. It is debatable as to how much of the former is down to the vaccine itself, or the lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common locally (anecdotally) and nationwide. The vaccine does not under any circumstance appear to provide 100 percent immunity from the disease and it is still possible for a vaccinated person to act as a vector for the virus and pass it on to others.</p>
<p>I believe the vaccine may decrease the likelyhood of transmission, but I would need to research that further to be certain.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, the media does seem to be handcuffed by OFCOM so that any negative sentiment of the vaccine (poor efficacy or breakthrough infections) and side effects is being suppressed. This is what is leading to a degree of scepticism and hesitancy I believe.</p>
<p>Hope that this is insightful.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, you can’t censor everything then ask people to trust you. I can’t imagine why transmission would be lower from a vaccinated person, especially if they were less likely to show symptoms and didn’t know they were sick. I can see how they would be less likely to get it and thus less likely to transmit If that’s what you mean.</p>

        <p>Yeah you have got it pal.</p>
<p>I read something the other day (I believe it was Fauci) who stated that an individual who has a breakthrough infection (but is vaccinated), carries thereabouts the same amount of the virus in their nasal passages than an unvaccinated individual. </p>
<p>Aha - here is the source: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-fauci-covid-19-unvaccinated-americans-delta-variant-face-the-nation/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthony-fauci-covid-19-unvaccinated-americans-delta-variant-face-the-nation/</a></p>
<p>How that impacts on things, I am not sure. Personally, I am holding out for a more 'traditional' vaccine (de-activated virus) or failing that much longer term safety data or a next generation of mRNA vaccines that prove to be more effective in blocking this 'delta' scariant. Anecdotally, many people I know personally have caught COVID in the last fortnight despite being double jabbed, hence my scepticism toward the prevailing narrative that these vaccines are highly effective and these vaccines will be our route back to true life.</p>

        <p>This is something that has been uncovered in the last week.  The vaxx doesn’t mean you won’t get it, it doesn’t mean you don’t carry it, and it doesn’t mean you don’t pass it.  What it is being heralded for is that it prevents the taker from getting serious illness.  Making it, to me, a much more personal choice.  </p>
<p>There are also fringe theories (I have no reference that’s why I say fringe) that say those with waning vaxx immunity hold MORE virus in their nose than un-CVaxx.  What this May show, again caveat of fringe/unsupported opinion, is that the vaxxed could spread it easier and being asymptomatic would mean they wouldn’t know they are even sick.  Making them more dangerous and not less.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard from people close to me who are vaccinated that they realize they can still get covid and transmit it, but they’re okay with still having gotten the vaccine because they feel if they do catch covid it’ll be a very mild case.</p>
<p>And I guess that’s it. The argument of “getting vaccinated to protect other people” doesn’t seem to hold a lot of ground anymore after data showed that infected vaccinated people carry a nearly identical viral load to unvaccinated people. </p>
<p>Because that’s the case, should vaccinated people be treated differently from unvaccinated people? We can all still catch it. We can all still transmit it to others. And we all still carry similar viral loads. </p>

        <p>No, Nope and we have been saying this for some time, and been trying to warn... Odd huh.</p>
<p>It's easy to say were all just a bunch of nutjobs, but nutjobs don't usually dig into alternative sources quite like we do at NNN.</p>
<p>Not all is verifiable and trustworthy, but if one was to look closer then just the titles, one would see that we in comments even pick apart most things. we like to cross reference and listen to the experts the mass media don't want because they don't fit the "narrative"</p>
<p>I personally think the most mind blowing thing is the very creator of the mRNA is rattling warning bells and only select few are listening.</p>

        <p>The theory is, I think, that you'll get a milder case of COVID if you get the vaccine, so you'll be less likely to clog up a hospital bed that could be used for another patient (COVID or not). This fails to take into account that many people would end up with a mild case of COVID whether or not they get the vaccine, and for some people, especially the young, the side effects can be worse than getting COVID itself.</p>

        <p>It isn’t reasonable to assume there won’t be any side effects of the vaccine. So you’d have to weight the statistically likely hood of hospitalization against the statistical likelihood of a vaccine complication (something we don’t have enough information about) and the gap gets really small when you do that. It doesn’t make sense to take medical treatment risking complications, if you are already low risk for severe covid if your goal is to avoid using up a hospital bed.</p>

        <p>At this point protecting others isn't an argument as you stated unless you're arguing that unvaccinated will take up more hospital beds, or that they're creating the variants. Both of these appear to be over conflated or completely false. We in fact may see a surge in vaccinated hospital patients as we head into the fall due to ADE. There are also many scientists arguing that viral evolution drives viruses to become more transmittable and less deadly. There's also the notion that the vaccinated are creating these variants rather than the unvaccinated. The fact that these vaccines were given EUA status in the US is also based on the suppresion of other viable treatments such as ivermectin paired with vitamin d and zinc. This last one alone blasts any other arguments about hospital capacity out of the water; if it can be treated with generic drugs and vitamins what was the purpose of all this? We're also not operating in an environment of transparency as the specific risks inherent to these vaccines have not been disclosed to the public. We can't give informed consent if we aren't informed.</p>

        <p>&rt;If the vaccine does not lower the risk of contracting the virus, and does not lower the risk of transmitting the virus, is there any reason getting the vaccine still protects other people? </p>
<p>There's a big difference between getting a mild cold for a couple days and going to the hospital.  And Delta has a much higher chance of hospitalization w/o the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;An analysis of 38,805 sequenced cases in England revealed that the Delta variant was associated with a 2.61 times higher risk of hospitalisation</p>
