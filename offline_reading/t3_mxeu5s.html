    <strong>Any "middle ground" folks on here?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I joined this group not really aware of what it was, and I can tell it's very anti mask/lockdowns and against vaccines for the most part. I feel conflicted because while I do not want this to be a "new normal", I do wear a mask, and have been vaccinated since January, especially since I'm a healthcare worker. I don't want anyone to become sick or die of course, and I work with immunocompromised children as well. However, I'm really starting to get to the point where I feel increasingly frustrated as I feel I've done my part, and it seems like the lockdowns are never-ending, at least where I live (west coast). I do think the pandemic is real; but I think some (many) of the restrictions are ridiculous and that we can't lockdown endlessly; there needs to be an end point especially since there's a vaccine. I also think that the endless virtue signaling and mixed messages from our government are getting more and more absurd by the day. </p>
<p>I guess I'm curious to know if any other folks skimming on here fall where I do. I feel like a crazy person since I can't relate to many people in my circles anymore, as it feels like half of them want the world to be locked down forever and the other half don't care at all. I just want life back as it was, but don't want to see people needlessly harmed in the process. Thanks for reading!</p></p>

        <p>I’m staunchly against the “new normal” and everything that comes with it, that’s why I’m here. People can feel free to wear masks and get their vaccines but I don’t want to participate in that. I should not be bullied and shamed into it.</p>

        <p>I guess, intuitively anyone felt something weird about this pandemic and completely disproportional response. What really surprised me from the very beginning is how little it has to do with the virus itself, and how much it is about reordering the whole society in a new totalitarian way. </p>
<p>The further it went, the less I was worried about the virus, and just terrified with how ugly our world became.</p>
<p>And I just can not to use this analogy with latest 30th in Germany in 20th century. Yeah, it's different, the guys behind this are not Nazis, they're using different tactics and methods, and their goals are different, yeah, agreed. But back then Nazis were different from any other "bad guys" too. So following this logic citizens had no reason to worry about them, they even was against communists.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I was living in Berlin in 1939, would I worry about loosing my job and my friends, or  seeing the situation as it is? Would I thinking about my career and buying new house, getting married and have children, or maybe was thinking to escape Germany as quickly as possible even if I loose all my savings? It's easy for us to say it today, but I guess the people who questioned the normality of 3rd Reich felt the same way, like a crazy persons.</p>
<p>Luckily for us we're still in the situation, when we can do something about it, or at least not to do. And it's just a common sense not to fully cooperate with the regime ( I just can't call them governments, sorry)  if you have any doubts that all they do is for your safety and security.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask, social distance when appropriate. I have what would be called vaccine hesitancy. </p>
<p>I dont like masks, i think restrictions should have been lifted sooner, i just want more information about long term side effects because im in one of the lowest risk groups</p>
<p>I think that's pretty middle ground. I could be wrong.</p>
