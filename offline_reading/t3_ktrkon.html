    <strong>How to enact totalitarian rule.</strong>
    <p><p>(The list is long, pardon me. I got carried away. Let me know if I need to add or take away.)</p>
<p>Step 1: Start with liberal ideologies &amp; saying hate speech shouldn't be allowed.</p>
<p>Step 2: Let social media giants come up with a way to "combat hate speech". Make it difficult for your political enemies to enjoy themselves on these platforms, then mock their complaints saying "build your own site".</p>
<p>Step 3: Add more things to the offensive list so it gets harder &amp; harder to be "politically correct". While doing this, see that the social media platforms improve in functionality so more people will flock to them &amp; not the homemade sites from step 2.</p>
<p>Step 4: Use a tragedy from members of a valued race (black) to give your country a taste of what happens when you push the boundaries (CSA flag &amp; monument attacks of 2015).</p>
<p>Step 5: Spawn hatred against police, an important line of defense in all communities.</p>
<p>Step 6: Let a pandemic in &amp; use that as an excuse to get everyone to socially distance &amp; stay home, thus creating more need for social media. Also enforce draconian laws &amp; silence your dissidents by saying they're "spreading misinformation".</p>
<p>Step 7: Use another tragedy from a member of the valued race to completely shed your liberal label, revealing you were a leftist the whole time, &amp; make the attacks in 2015 look like a playdate. This will get the majority to fear you.</p>
<p>Step 8: Revive hatred against cops using said tragedy, &amp; actually defund the police, which removes said line of defense in multiple communities.</p>
<p>Step 9: Blame all the crap that happened in steps 6, 7, &amp; 8 on your political enemies (Trump, his supporters, &amp; Republicans). Hope this will get your team elected.</p>
<p>Step 10: Just rig the election, then use your "combating misinformation" tools to silence anyone who questions the election integrity.</p>
<p>Step 11: Wait for your enemies to get mad enough to do something drastic. Once they do, call it terrorism &amp; blame your greatest opponent (Trump) for causing it.</p>
<p>Step 12: Use what happened in step 11 to ban your enemies from the social media platforms we all heavily rely on due to step 6 to "avoid any further danger".</p>
<p>Step 13: Wipe out any apps your enemies created in step 2, making it way difficult to try anything other than the main social media platforms.</p>
<p>Step 14: Work closely with social media giants &amp; your "elected" crooks to enact full-blown censorship for any political enemy you find.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly but these brainwashed sheep aren’t waking up. This entire event the last year has been pre planned and staged. Sadly I don’t see it changing too many sheep.</p>

        <p>fuck, totally see it too.  my problem is I’m having a hard time living like this.  this is a god damned nightmare.  almost everyone i know in the real world is brainwashed to hell about this.  talking about how new zealand has shown that we can beat the virus.   hats off to them, but the rest of continental europe and obedieny heavily masking liberal cities in the US show otherwise.  its the worst of both worlds, and the idea of a technocratic coup is kind of the obvious conclusion, considering how hair brained fauci and the science seems to be currently.   where to go?  mexico?</p>
