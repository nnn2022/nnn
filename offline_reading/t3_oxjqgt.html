    <strong>Changing views on guns</strong>
    <p><p>I have always been scared of guns; I first started using them at Boy Scout camp and found them terrifying. I have been saddened by how guns make suicides, gang violence, and mass killings easier for the perpetrators. I still believe I will never own a gun.</p>
<p>With all that said, THANK YOU to those who do. The only reason I can sleep at night knowing the government won’t kick down our doors and force a medical procedure I don’t want on me is that enough of you have guns that they’d never risk the PR nightmare. God bless</p></p>

<p>Keep in mind the numbers of gun deaths are inflated by suicides. </p>

<p>It can be scary when a friend or loved one is thinking about suicide. It's hard to know how a suicidal crisis feels and how to act. Call 1-800-273-TALK (8255)</p>

        <p>If you live in America and you do not own a firearm. I suggest you step out of your comfort zone and get one. The only person you should rely on for your protection and your families protection is yourself. If you show up to a gun club or firing range looking to learn. You will not be met with hostility. Don't get mad if people joke with you and you think they are making fun of you. If you pay attention that's how everyone speaks to each other out there.</p>

        <p>I can relate. I 100% support 2A, and highly respect everyone who does. However, I do not trust <strong>myself</strong> with a gun. Haven't had those kinds of thoughts in a couple of years now, but enough in my life that I know better than to have one within reach. I have other things available to protect myself, but a gun is one thing I WISH I trusted myself to have. Definitely a HUGE THANK YOU, to everyone who does.</p>

        <p>It's really very basic.   A gun is a tool and they are not complicated.  Nothing to fear.   Don't point it at anyone and if you don't want it to fire then don't pull the trigger.   </p>
<p>One thing you could do is go to a gun range.  And ask to shoot and they will help you with everything.   Tell them your fears and that you might be nervous. They have seen it all and will simplify it for you.   Start with a .22 pistol which has zero kick.  Then go up.  This will let you feel what it is like to shoot.</p>
<p>If you do end up getting your own gun someday there are ac few basics to keep everyone safe at home you need to know.  There are classes in him safety you can take.</p>

        <p>100%! i’ve slowly been changing my views about guns and trying to learn basics by watching videos, but i’m definitely going to go to an in person class to actually shoot one and learn proper handling &amp; safety. i guess i’m more so just scared of some of the people i’ve known to have guns that aren’t mentally stable, so it’s given me a bad connotation about guns in general, but obviously the guns aren’t to blame haha</p>

        <p>Those mentally unstable people are out there whether you have a gun or not.   But,  shootings like that are exceedingly rare.   You are much more likely to get struck by lightening than be involved in a gun incident. (Assuming you don't live in a very high crime area,  gangs etc)</p>
<p>The best thing is to go try it.  You may shoot for the first time and not like it at all and that is ok too.</p>

        <p>When my husband first gifted a gun to me I was excited but too afraid to take it out of the box until I took it to a shooting range to meet an instructor.</p>
<p>I learned so much from the instructor. Not only about gun safety and shooting, I learned about the laws surrounding gun ownership, the rights and responsibilities.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same OP! I've always believed bad things happen when guns are around, but it seems more like bad things happen when bad people are around. My biggest fear about owning a gun is that it would be stolen and used for violence. I even had the same boy scout experience, I enjoyed shooting them then but the implications of owning one I'm still unsure of. One of the scariest days of my life was when my mother in law was given a gun from her father. I love the woman but she's not the sharpest tool in the shed and her just owning one made me uneasy. But she hasn't shot anyone or herself so there's that. Kind of got off on a tangent... definitely agree that it's in times like these we see what the second amendment is truly for. Thanks for keeping our government in their place responsible gun owners!</p>

        <p>Don't be scared of guns. Even if you get a single shot shotgun for your personal safety, do it. Take a class, learn how to be safe with it and dream to never ever get to use it on anyone.</p>
<p>However, if the time comes...</p>

        <p>Now is the time to get one. They're actually relatively affordable still, ammo is what's ridiculously expensive.</p>
<p>Just make sure that you get some proper training.</p>

        <p>I was in the scouts and never shot, was scared as well. One day a friend invited me to a local range and coached me through a pistol. </p>
<p>Now I have everything under the sun and hunt.</p>
