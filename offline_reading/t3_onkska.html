<title>COVID-19 antibodies persist at least nine months after infection. 98.8 percent of people infected in February/March showed detectable levels of antibodies in November, and there was no difference between people who had suffered symptoms of COVID-19 and those that had been symptom-free</title>

        <p>Antibodies are completely irrelevant long term. We have t-cell immunity either way. No matter the infection, antibodies are ONLY present during an infection and some time after that. When there's no need for antibodies, they disappear, it's normal. Once you get infected again your t-cells start producing antibodies again.   </p>
<p>This is old fucking science that we've known for ages. They just tricked people by yelling "ANTIBODIES GO AWAY AFTER X AMOUNT OF TIME". It's totally irrelevant.</p>
