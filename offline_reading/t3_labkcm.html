        <p>I have friends that just came back. They are strict! Anyone 2+ mask that covers nose, no exceptions. 2 year old doesn’t like it they will remind once then you are escorted out. Announcement plays every 15-20 min about social distancing and masks usage.</p>

        <p>They enforce masks big time. Once you are inside, you still have to wear the mask. Not like the stories from grocery stores where you only need it to get inside the door. Disney has staff all over the place, and if they see you with a nose out, mask off, etc, they will tell you to fix it. They have been known to get security to escort out people who refuse to wear a mask. There are designated areas where you are allowed to take a "mask break" and sit down and take off your mask. </p>
<p>You can take off the mask only if you are stopped, away from others, and actively eating or drinking.</p>
<p>In December, my husband and I were sitting at a table, definitely six feet away from the next table. We were outside. I was eating cotton candy. My husband was just sitting. Both of our masks were off. An employee walked by and told my hubby to put his mask on. </p>
<p>Prior to entry they take your temperature. </p>
<p>As for social distancing, well, they try with the markers on the ground, but this is probably where they are the most lenient.</p>

        <p>The theater is overwhelming to the point where I would have to wonder why you would pay that kind of money to be subjected to that experience. Not a fan of WDW myself, but I would only go if all the restrictions went away. Hell, you might even have a better time with Universal Studios.</p>

        <p>I'd imagine you will probably have to ask the specific D-World sub. I personally can't imagine wearing one all day, especially in the hot sun when you're walking around so much because when I was there it was literally 15 miles+ of walking per day.</p>

        <p>The biggest and most easily fixed problem with Disney world is no shade anywhere. Just a couple trees over where people stand in line for rides would have done a world of good. Than one that I think should be a health requirement is water fountains. The entire two days I was there with my family we didnt see even one drinking fountain. All we could fine was stalls charging extortion prices for tiny water bottles. It was bad in every single way. They couldnt even do the bare minimum to care for the customers. I hated Disney world, way to many great theme parks in the area to waste time there.</p>

        <p>Disney pumped a lot of money into the security theater and from what I've heard, masks are strictly enforced...they will literally stop certain rides if someone pulls their mask down. They also made a point to release a statement that people who have gotten the vaccine still have to wear a mask. I don't see Disney giving up the security theater anytime this year. However, they did recently stop social distancing on certain rides and they brought back park hopping. But masks are strictly enforced and I don't see that changing anytime soon. We are planning on a trip in Fall of 2022.</p>

        <p>I live about 45 minutes away. It's ground zero for restrictions.</p>
<p>Masks are heavily enforced and employees are posted throughout the parks to enforce them. Even as something as simple as having it slip down your nose or taking it off for a picture will result in you getting yelled at.  An announcement blares over the PA system reminding you of the guidelines every 10 or so minutes, including on transportation. Before entering, they take your temperature.</p>
<p>Many things such as parades and character meetups are gone or heavily scaled back. A capacity limit is still in place. Social distancing is surprisingly not enforced at all.</p>
<p>Save yourself time and money and don't go. There's much better things to do in Florida than going to Disney.</p>

        <p>I went in September. They enforce it pretty strictly. I bought a grey mesh mask that I could easily breathe through. I normally don’t wear one but I had spent the money already and it was for my honeymoon. It actually rocked because the lines were no existent. Even though I had a mesh mask, nobody said a thing. Then again, because of the color, you couldn’t really see through it so it looked legit enough.</p>
