    <strong>Doesn't the mRNA vaccine just create GMO people?</strong>
    <p><p>hear me out....actually, hear out these quotes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>from the CDC</p>
<p>" mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. <strong><em>Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein</em></strong>—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. "</p>
<p>" <strong><em>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make</em></strong> a harmless piece of what is called the “spike protein.” The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. "</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and the definition of "genetically modified organism" GMO</p>
<p>" An organism whose genetic characteristics have been altered by the insertion of a modified gene or a gene from another organism using the techniques of genetic engineering. "</p>
<p><a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/genetically+modified+organism">https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/genetically+modified+organism</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>im no scientist but doesn't that mean that the people who took the vaccine, essentially became GMO people?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean the way I am reading this is....</p>
<p>mRNA = tells your cells what to do they didnt otherwise do naturally</p>
<p>GMO = tells your cells what to do that they didnt otherwise do naturally</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and if that's the case then a follow up question would be....are those people now owned by the company that own the patent of the vaccine? I mean, we can patent GMO stuff, and if a person has now been classified as GMO......or would they own the parts that taught "our cells how to make a [COVID] protein"........</p></p>

        <p>Which cells does the vaccine affect? And what happens to the cells that were reprogrammed to produce the spike proteins?</p>
<p>I've heard people say that it will alter your whole DNA (in every cell of your body basically) but I don't think it's that easy.</p>

        <p>Well, GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism.  An mRNA “vaccine” doesn’t technically alter your genes (or at least they claim it doesn’t).  It just puts mRNA into the cell (not the nucleus) so that your cell produces a protein it can’t (because the DNA necessary to produce the mRNA required isn’t there).  Once the mRNA supplied by the “vaccine” gets broken down (like all mRNA does) then the cell can’t produce that protein anymore.</p>

        <p>And your opinion is based on what? I mean, you are entilted to believe what you want but when your opinion contradicts the basics of molecular biology you may want to reconsider it. This new vaccine is not altering the DNA in any form, it just provides and already transcribed piece of one of the virus proteins so our own cells can make the protein. After the protein have been made, the inmune system is capable of recognizing it as foreign and build up our defenses.</p>
<p>mRNA is rapidly degraded by several enzymes and by itself so when all the mRNA from the vaccine is degraded the virus protein production stops. The DNA is NOT modified by any transgen, it does not adquired the codifying sequence to express the virus mRNA.</p>

        <p>Great observation.</p>
<p>Now consider this: Monsanto and Bayer are the same company.</p>
<p>Bayer owes much of their clinical research to the Nazis experimenting on the Jews in Concentration Camps in WWII.</p>
<p>Monsanto of course has been spraying the globe with glyfosate (Round Up) for decades.</p>
<p>They used to go to farms in the 50s and 60s, and tell farmers there was absolutely no danger and no harm in dousing your fields with this glyfosate.  </p>
<p>Later, they developed seeds which were glyfosate resistant.  Meaning, you could grow your crops, and use glyfosate with impunity to take out any of the weeds, but your crops wouldn't be affected, because of these special, patented and trademarked seeds you were eventually forced into using.</p>
<p>Three decades later and everyone suddenly has allergies, diabetes and cancer.  </p>
<p>Allergies are a great clue.  40 years ago, nobody had allergies.  Now?  It's rare to find even one person.  </p>
<p>But we're told they have no idea how any of that happened.</p>
<p>Glyfosate (Round Up).  Monsanto.  Bayer.  Experimenting for Jews in Concentration Camps.  Big Pharma.  Genetically Modified Foods.</p>
<p>And now, these are the very same people who want to force you to be injected with a completely experimental barely tested brand you vaccine.</p>
<p>But don't worry.  They promise you there will be no bad side effects.</p>
