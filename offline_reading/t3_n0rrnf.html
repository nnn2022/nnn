    <strong>The new normal is old discrimination, rebranded</strong>
    <p><p>My 6-year-old daughter has Down Syndrome and Autism. This afternoon, we took a trip to Discount Dance Supply to buy her ballet clothing. Before we even left the house, we knew that there were probably going to be issues with this trip, because they repeated about 11 times in their phone message how they have reduced hours to protect their employees, which makes about as much sense as having a soup sandwich for lunch. When we pulled in to the parking lot, there were huge signs on their window indicating how masks must be worn inside.  Realizing that they might have an issue with my daughter, who is completely unable to wear a mask due to tactile sensitivity, my wife walked up to the store first to talk to the employee. They completely refused to serve us.
Their only solution was that they could bring clothes out to the sidewalk, which also would not work because my daughter elopes and we would risk her being possibly hit by a car. They completely refused our counter-solution which was to walk those same clothes over another 5 feet to our car, where my daughter would be secured in her car seat, and my wife and I would have worn a mask, despite the fact that it's pointless to do this outdoors.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine that a shop that sells ballet clothing is making a particularly large amount of money at this point in time. So now, I guess we get to give our money to Amazon, who probably needs the business a lot less than this place.</p></p>

        <p>Wow I’m so sorry this happened to you. I work in a special needs classroom and no students are forced to wear masks because they just can’t. It’s awful that staff have to wear them because half of these kids are non-verbal and depend on facial expressions. So sad.</p>

        <p>I would like to wait a day or two to see how the owner responds, if at all. HOPEFULLY the manager is just a really shitty person and the owner can talk to them and ensure that this never happens again.</p>
<p>As my wife was leaving, she warned the manager "are you sure you refuse to serve us? We are going to leave a Yelp review and contact the ADA."</p>
<p>She already left a review, so I will update this post if I hear anything else.</p>

        <p>It’s now somehow acceptable to discriminate against anyone with a disability or special need under the false pretence of “following policy” and “protecting others” . It’s all bullshit and just a new way of saying ‘we don’t care about you, only money and following the mob’ none of these establishments show any humanity in their empty corporate souls. And there’s a reason 90% of businesses fail within 3 years and it’s because most business owners are fucking idiots who shovel their political and personal views into their stores</p>

        <p>What you are describing is one thing I complained about in my letter to Goodwill corporate. Goodwill claims to help people with disabilities, but are hypocrites. They have a no exception mask policy that is discriminary to people with both physical and mental issues. Thank you for bringing this up. These companies that claim to be saviors of the disabled, because they hire them, are making it so some can't shop there.</p>

        <p>You have ALLL my sympathies. The US cannot comprehend, even when it is obvious (God forbid if not!!!) that not everyone can 'mask up". I'm so sorry for your lovely daughter. I've worked in a dance store before and sooo wish I had been there..there would have been zero issue and your daughter would have had a lovely experience. When they go out of business, no one to blame but themselves. IF you don't like amazon. <a href="https://discountdance.com">discountdance.com</a> might be a good choice</p>
