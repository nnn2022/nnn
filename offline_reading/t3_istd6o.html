    <strong>Best dating app/strategy for wlw who wants to go on in person dates?</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: if I am an anti-lockdown wlw trying to meet for real dates, what dating app should I use (if any), and what should I put in my ad to avoid the haters?  </p>
<p>After coming out of lockdown induced depression thanks to a wonderful group of new friends who I hang out with in person, I am ready to jump back into the dating scene! What is your advice on how to handle that as a bi woman? Which dating app would you recommend? I used to use Lex but the last time I posted there looking for in person dates, my ad got taken down within hours of posting. But maybe that is just the culture of that particular app; what app(s) would you say are good for meeting women (and men/people in general) during these fucked up times? (For real dates hopefully leading to a relationship, not just hookups)  </p>
<p>Also, I am wondering how much info about myself I should put in the ad(s). I'd like to save time and weed out right away those who are not looking to meet up in person, not just because zoom "dates" are pathetic bs, but because I don't feel like I can trust someone pro-lockdown to not treat me like The Evil One for being anti-lockdown. I've just been through too much personal trauma from people with those attitudes to be willing to cater to their fears. But at the same time, I'm worried that if I put too much info about both who I am (face photo, stuff about my creative work etc) plus too much stuff about my being anti-lockdown/wanting to meet, that it could lead to someone trying to "cancel" me, ie telling social media to shun me and not hire me as a creative professional. I do feel like "cancel culture" is more prevalent in the queer community, but maybe this fear of it being done from a personals ad is overblown? I don't know.</p></p>

        <p>I have gone on a bunch of IRL dates via Tinder and Hinge. I was pleasantly surprised by how many men were open to hanging out in person. I didn‚Äôt put anything specifically about my feelings about being anti lockdowns in my profile but I could tell from chatting mostly if someone was going to be want to wear masks in person or not meet up at all. I swipe left on anyone who posts a mask selfie also ha. Good luck!!</p>

        <p>Can't speak to wlw, but I've been going on in-person dates using tinder and hinge. I haven't said anything special on my tinder bio but on hinge, I've said that I'm attracted to non-conformist, independent thinker types. Though, tbh I'm still trying to figure out how to identify like-minded people. One thing I'm doing is asking what they've been doing to keep themselves busy. I always say that I'm trying to live as normally as possible as a hint. I will say that just because someone is willing to meet in person, doesn't mean they aren't a covidian, from personal experience. They just make excuses for themselves for why it's okay, or they assume you're taking the same kinds of precautions as them (like social bubbles). So, going forward I'll probably be more transparent about my anti-new normalness to avoid wasting time. Also, I'm largely avoiding guys who do any progressive politics virtue signalling and I always swipe left on the masked!</p>

        <p>I think it‚Äôs best to be upfront, but in practice that‚Äôs hard. No one wants to be uncouth or inappropriately controversial right off the bat. Maybe find a place that you know won‚Äôt enforce masks and meet there?</p>

        <p>as much as i fucking despise tinder and online dating, its probably your best bet.  i would only reccomend it if there are no other options. i  fucking hate it though...here's why</p>
<p>ive used tinder during all this bullshit and after a while, i realized why i fucking hate online dating. i cant determine weather or not i want to fuck based on a chat and seeing pics. i need to see and interact with them in real life before i decide if i even wanna flirt with them. too many people expect sex after matching, chatting, and seeing pics</p>
<p>interacting with people via a screen is the worst way to interact with people. so much about human interaction is absent. you need to experience the interaction via all the five senses in order for the interaction to be meaningful. if you just trade pics and see their bio pics, that doesnt provide enough information about the person. how do they interact with the world? how do they interact with other people? how do they speak? whats their style? what is their physical presence like? etc... there are too many questions left unanswered by online interactions. and you only see what they choose to show; it is very easy for them to hide shit</p>
<p>also i am very, very picky. there are very few people i would actually want to interact with sexually and/or romantically. a crowded bar, club, rave, or concert enables me to easily sift through people who im not attracted to. i can see and interact with a large amount of people in real life all at once</p>
