    <strong>What did all the high risk people do before this ?</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously I never knew the word immunocompromised prior to all this , what did they do with SARS 1, H1N1 etc.  Or even in the 50s and 60s pandemics.  Or flu season.  Why now are we called on to stop life?</p></p>

        <p>I have had two friends go through leukemia (sadly both did not make it but fought for several years.) They both had bone marrow transplants and that means literally NO immune system - your bone marrow is destroyed and the new bone marrow needs to rebuild. When one friend was recovering at home after leaving the hospital I remember visiting her at home and having to scrub my hands with special soap. SHE wore a mask when walking briefly outside. SHE avoided crowds and grocery stores and restaurants. There certainly was no expectation that others stay inside to prevent her from catching a cold, which could have killed her.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine had 2 reoccurring bouts of some bone marrow disease and needed a transplant too. She was officially immunocompromised. Her parents did excessive research on fast food places (not sure why) and forbid her to eat from some of them, and for a short while they didn't let her go to indoor crowded spaces like cinemas but still let her go to outdoor crowded spaces. They made her use a lot of hand sanitizer. But they never even considered using masks and never even told us, her friends, to use hand sanitizer or to stay away unless we were sick.</p>

Basically, the rules the author lived by after a bone marrow transplant were hand washing, avoiding touching surfaces, and keeping a distance from other people. These are actions people take to protect themselves. They are not supposed to be imposed on an entire population in the name of protecting each other.</p>

        <p>Easy: just living their lives without this MSM fearmongering we have now. No social media in your face 24/7. I can't remember H1N1 being such a big deal, I was only reading my local newspaper at the time and there was no announcement of the daily infections etc. Also because there was no aggressive testing to blow up the numbers.</p>

        <p>I suspect they did what I'd be doing if I was high risk. Enjoying life as much as possible because you might not always have it. Honestly a lot of the high risk people I know are anti-lockdown because they know they don't have many years left and they don't want to waste them sheltering from the inevitable. </p>
<p>Have you not noticed how it's always 'My friend had a liver transplant' or 'My grandma is 96' rather than 'I have a weakened immune system?'</p>

        <p>I'm probably mid-risk.  Not immunocompromised, but older than most of you, with a health condition.  I figure it's up to me to decide what level of risk I can handle.  If I think it's too risky to go to a certain place, it's up to me to avoid it.  That doesn't mean the event should be shutdown.</p>

        <p>It's for political expediency.  The war on terror  and the "so-called "climate crisis" wasn't successful in the authoritarian control of the public so politicians have turned their fears inward on an invisible threat that causes fear of asymptomatic, non-tribal, people. </p>

        <p>They hate Trump too. Because he's making deals/treaties that are better for the US and not handouts to them. And it's also a way to grow their own internal power, which many of these politicians <em>love</em> to do because they're authoritarian hacks.</p>

<p>People make fun of Rush Limbaugh and he’s worth $500,000,000 and owns his own private island in Florida. You think he cares that people make fun of him?</p>
<p>People also make fun of Elon Musk. He’s a billionaire married to a super hot chick. I guarantee you he doesn’t care either. </p>
<p>I could go on. People mock all kinds of people. Doesn’t mean they’re not super successful and happy. Adam Sandler is a shitty actor who hasn’t been funny in over 25 years but he’s a zillionaire and doesn’t care what anyone thinks.</p>

<p>That's just not even true in the slightest, plenty of countries have freedom and have had it for a very long time.</p>
<p>Mexico, Britain, France, and Denmark had all abolished slavery before the United States adopted the 13th Amendment in 1865.</p>
<p>All that wealth is spread amongst only a handful of people, instead of the general population, that's like saying "we're an a+ school!" When only 2 people in the entire school received an a+</p>
<p>If you honestly think america has invented everything everyone uses you're just stupid. Don't know what to tell you there, I think it's safe to say the majority of items you use have been invented in a European country.</p>

        <p>We did the same thing I think <em>everyone</em> (from your oft-maligned immunocompromised, "obese, diabetic grandparents" to the healthiest of 20-year-olds) did when COVID came on the scene: we do our mental risk assessments and plan our days accordingly. </p>
<p>I would like to know if <em>anyone</em> here looked at this outbreak the first time you found out about it, or the first time you found out it had appeared in your country, and said "no risk, whatsoever!" I want to think most people looked at it and said "Well, a lot of people have died, but not <em>that</em> many (i.e., the fatality rate is pretty low), and the people most at risk seem to be older or have other health conditions." Then, they say "Well, I'm pretty healthy, but I am X years old, and have had (other health condition) for a while, so I might not go out as much. Maybe stay away from crowded places for a while. Just 'til it blows over." Or they say "Nah, I'm Y years old, I never smoke or drink and I can run a 4.6 40, so this makes no nevermind to me!" But even if it's at an almost unconscious level, you do the arithmetic, and you change your lifestyle accordingly. Same with driving, same with going to the grocery store. There is some level of risk inherent in everything we do. We modify our own behavior to compensate.</p>
<p>I have wondered often how much attitudes would change in this sub if the disease were more deadly, i.e., what level of disruption to daily life would be accepted by X% of the population if the fatality rate of the disease was Y%. AIDS changed a lot of people's lives in the way they thought about sex, and it had far-ranging implications on numerous other everyday circumstances (schools, hospitals, the workplace, etc.), despite being significantly more difficult to transmit than, say, the flu or measles, and that would seem to be largely because it has high lethality across the board. If Ebola were to hit a major population center, say NYC or London or Tokyo, how much would we be willing to put up with to stop the spread? Again, harder to transmit than coronaviruses, but far deadlier across the board. Would we be arguing about opening schools, or would we be demanding border closures? The West African Ebola epidemic gave us a taste of what that would look like, but its spread was (thankfully) very limited outside of west Africa. Just a thought.</p>

        <p>At this point I would never support lockdowns, mandates, or prohibitions at ANY CFR or IFR, but if the fatality was <em>much, much</em> higher, I'd voluntarily go out less and would be okay with strong advisories short of a legal requirement. I wouldn't want to stop working or completely isolate no matter what. I'd rather risk getting a virus that has a 30% chance of killing me than have a near 100% chance of losing my last fertile years to "public health" rules that don't allow me to use them.</p>
