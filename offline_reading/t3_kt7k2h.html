    <strong>Feeling out of sorts...</strong>
    <p><p>I have been vehemently opposed to the lockdowns, closure of schools, SAH orders, masks, media hysteria and politicization of all the above since March 13th when they shut my state down.  I'm  lucky enough to have a husband that supports my views also and his family does too.  But recently there seems to have been a shift...my in-laws were extremely anti lockdown and anti mask and spent the whole summer with us and their grandkids but right around thanksgiving when cases started to increase they changed.  They said several of their friends got it and they have "seen what this virus can do."  Also, in the past 2 weeks I've had several friends who have gotten it (all fine of course) and are now  terrified and believe that what the state is imposing is the right course of action.  Furthermore, they moved my daughter's school to virtual until end of January (I took her out and put her in a private school now) and I hear so many moms who were against the school shutdowns now supporting it bc "winter is going to be bad and everyone is getting it."  What?  It's like people have had a sudden shift in how they feel about it bc it's winter? Or they know someone who got it?  Or they have gotten it?</p>
<p>This coupled with the events of the past few days, I'm just feeling lost and sort of out of balance.  Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>It's strange. I know a few of my friends who said their family members have it, and my friends are all distressed about it. I like to ask what their symptoms are, and it's usually "They can't smell or taste and they're tired." So the entire world is shut down for this "scary" virus? These symptoms don't seem like the same symptoms that were so scary causing people to drop dead in the streets in Wuhan.</p>

        <p>I was in Barcelona in March, when it got shutdown. I got what felt like a cold, not even a severe cold. This is ridiculous.</p>
