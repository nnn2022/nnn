    <strong>Anyone in SoCal (or anywhere honestly) want to team up?</strong>
    <p><p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Want to amass personal stories from individuals who have been harmed by the lockdowns - businesses failing, hunger, suicide, health issues... everything. Thought people were just crazy, but most I met are just effing clueless about lockdown effects. Logic seldom works with emotional arguments, and perhaps instead of statistics and graphs, sad stories about the horrible effects of this useless lockdown will get somewhere? I figure it's worth a try.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hello all! I'm in SoCal, and currently feel like I'm watching the world gleefully pour gasoline on itself and light a match. For awhile, I thought that people had just gone crazy, but everyone I talked to, when pressed, legitimately know *nothing* about what's going on. They don't know the true death rate posted right on the CDC site. They don't know about the mRNA technology in the vaccine. They hadn't heard about the PCR cycles or how ridiculously sensitive they are. They don't know about the bacterial bronchitis that is caused by people wearing dirty masks. They don't know about it being likely airborne, which renders the masks even more useless. They were so sure of shutting down and masking up, but had no idea about any of the details behind it in the first place! It's madness!  </p>
<p>And honestly, I'm fed up. But I'm fed up of just preaching to the choir and complaining to the few people in my life who have retained their sanity, too. There's just too much stupidity and goddammit even if it crashes and burns, if I manage to get any information out to people then I'll be happy to.</p>
<p>Basically, my idea is this - gather together all the current information we have on the virus that shows how it's been overblown. But to also do my best to keep it impartial and as non political as is feasible. Now I know that's not new, I'm sure there are dozens of sites that have similar compilations. But I also want to start contacting people and getting their stories - people who's businesses have been shut down, their lives ruined, family and friends lost to suicide due to the lockdown, untreated diseases advancing because of covid - all of it. Everything. </p>
<p>Because one thing that I noticed with all the people I've talked to about the virus, is that they have NO. CLUE. how much damage the lockdown is doing. The media is shielding them from all emotional impacts that don't serve their purpose. So I want to try to mitigate that. Interview anyone who wants to be interviewed and just get their stories OUT THERE. Find any journalists that actually consider this whole thing to be overblown. Make one big compilation of suffering and show it to anyone who says 'just one life' And just... try. I'm tired of sitting around and doing nothing. I'm currently located in San Diego and would love to start local meetups as well. And also start calling all of our supposed public servants - you know, those mayors and our charming governor who is busy playing the role of a tiny tyrant. </p>
<p>Let me know if you'd like to help with this, or if you know anyone that might want to help. If you've been negatively affected by the lockdowns and want to make a statement, message me. And if you have any suggestions or recommendations or advice, please let me know. I'm tired of seeing so much division and I just wanna try. It's not a new approach, but... there are not many people more stubborn than me. I don't intend to stop trying until I either get somewhere or the world ends. </p>
<p>If you made it through to the end here, I thank you, and I hope you have a happy holiday and a very Merry Christmas. Here's hoping we can get somewhere :)</p></p>

        <p>There’s already a ReOpen San Diego group that’s meets once a week. I’ve never been to a meeting, but was on their fb group and met them at the last anti lockdown protest. PM me and I’ll give you all the info!</p>
