<title>It was inevitable something like this would happen. People have become very obsessive about certain topics the past couple years (Trump, gender, Gangnam Style, emojis, race) and now they've latched onto Covid. It's a memetic virus.</title>

    <strong>It was inevitable something like this would happen. People have become very obsessive about certain topics the past couple years (Trump, gender, Gangnam Style, emojis, race) and now they've latched onto Covid. It's a memetic virus.</strong>
    <p><p>Before all this bullshit my friends used to scoff at me for being "cynical" and "negative" (two words I've seen and heard used over and over again the past year and a half to belittle and squash any and all opposition, questioning and complaint brought up by our kind against masks, lockdowns and the "vaccines"). Why? Because I used to point out how stupid and narcissistic people had become in the past decade or so. I have a very low threshold for stupidity; whilst others would guffaw at videos of shit like the Harlem Shake I couldn't help but fucking cringe.</p>
<p>We have people killing themselves for selfies and memes (planking, tide pod challenge), scientists ignoring available treatments just so they're not associated with Trump (Ivermectin), "mostly peaceful" protesters burning down cities for a man who once held a pregnant woman at gunpoint, and legions of virtue-signalling nurses performing elaborate Cirque-du-soleil routines in empty hospital hallways on Tik-Tok under the flimsy pretense of lecturing/warning the general public about the supposedly deadly pandemic raging around us.</p>
<p>Believe me when I tell you we HAVE reached peak-stupidity as a species. The cavemen were less clownish than this. The internet has melted people's brains. People value their own phones and social media profiles over their own miserable fucking lives now. It doesn't matter if you feel like shit on the inside, so long as others think you're living your best life. BE POSITIVE. Apply that clown makeup! The circus must go on! üëèTheüëèEmojiüëèMovieüëèisüëèaüëècinematicüëèmasterpiece!üëè</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before this happened. Our narcissistic, reactionary culture invited it. The bad Orange Man with the mean tweets lived in people's heads for over four years (I was fucking sick of  hearing about him if you want to know the truth); this shit ain't going anywhere. The government and media have worked in tandem to capitalize on the general public's obsessive, self-absorbed nature to keep this Covid thing going as long as possible for power and money. Keep the lobotomized, blue check marked geese honking about it on Twitter and your average NPC will just go along with it because they're afraid of stepping out of line. They think they're "woke" but they're the exact fucking opposite.</p></p>

        <p>These are the same people who thought they were being so punk rock anti-establishment when they ragged against Bush or Trump and thought they were being progressive for supporting Obama and they never realized both Bush and Obama were the establishment they claimed to rage against...just like now, they think they are being anti-establishment progressives by falling in line with what corporate America and big pharma want them to do.</p>

        <p>Don't forget TikTok, where 99% of videos are people who think they are talented, or that lip syncing like 10,000 other people to some random rap song is something worthy of a view.</p>
<p>Nightmare = being at friends or family in the past and being subjected to watching TikTok videos.. starts with 'Oh did you see TikTok video' and then what turns from 15 second view now turns into 2 hours gggggggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>
