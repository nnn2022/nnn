    <strong>Karl-Anthony Towns claims 7 of his family members died of COVID. He's lying.</strong>
    <p><p>He lost his mother (very overweight, with comorbidities). That's verifiable. But he also claims he lost an uncle and 5 others. Although he doesn't give names, nor say how he was related to these people, nor do the media press him on it. </p>
<p>Assuming, <em>extremely</em> generously, that the average person has a 1 in 800 chance of dying of COVID-19, then if Towns counts his 80 closest relatives as "family", by the binomial theorem the chance of at least 7 of them dying of COVID would be 72 billion to 1.<br>
If you extend it all the way to 300 family members - and I don't think most people would call their 300th-closest relative “family” - it’s still more than 7 million to 1. It seems almost impossible that anyone on the planet could lose 7 family members to COVID-19, let alone a prominent NBA player who's been vocally melodramatic ("To my niece and nephew ... I promise you I will not end up in a box") about his own alleged case of the virus.</p>
<p>And the media repeat this fearmongering as gospel. </p></p>

        <p>If true, sounds like his family is a superspreader and they need to be sent to prison before they kill all of us.</p>
<p>This is how this works right?</p>

        <p>Ya he’s definitely a gigantic liar.</p>
<p>Most people don’t know anyone that died. I understand he’s upset about his mother dying but he definitely didn’t lose 6 additional family members from covid. He should set the record straight on this. Someone will call him out on this at some point. I suspect. Deaths are public record. You could check his claims pretty easily.</p>
<p>Note that dude was also vacationing in Mexico in the middle of this pandemic. Not a mask in sight.</p>

        <p>Wasn’t it something like he counted his mother as 6 different people, she was an aunt, sister, grandmother etc.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to look more into this. So apparently his mother died on April 13 in New Jersey, after a month long struggle with covid. KAT made the announcement that they were putting her into a medically induced coma on march 25th, after struggling for a week or two. They also then put her on a ventilator. She then had a stroke and they ultimately decided to take her off of life support. From what I gather, she has some preexisting conditions that made the family want her to go to the hospital when she started showing symptoms, but i can't find out what the preexisting conditions were. </p>
<p>In my opinion, she was a casualty of medical malpractice due to the fear and hysteria at the end of March 2020 in the greater New York City Metro area. She was most likely unnecessarily put into a medically induced coma then dangerously hooked up to a ventilator, and these  extreme interventions caused her to have a stroke, which in the end killed her. To chalk this up to covid is a stretch. And I'm confident that situations like hers account for a large percentage of the deaths in the NYC area. There is a reason why NYC is so much worse than almost anywhere else in the world. Its not because the virus was more deadly there, but rather the gross human errors due to irrational panic and fear.</p>
<p>As for the 6 other people, there is basically no other information about it. If this were actually true, this situation would have at least some basic details about the people involved, but as far as I can tell, the story ends with KAT's vague claim. The whole thing seems so fake, but it's basically accepted without question, probably due to the fact that his mom actually did die, and covid was involved. </p>

        <p>Have you ever considered that some people might be genetically susceptible to more severe illness from covid? And therefore entire families could have increased susceptibility throughout? There are countless stories where families have lost several members. Here is one:</p>
<p>https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/new-jersey-family-coronavirus.amp.html</p>
<p>I personally hope in a way that he is lying, because otherwise that is a lot of loss. </p>
<p>I suspect though that he is telling the truth. And I strongly suspect that you are an asshole. You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
