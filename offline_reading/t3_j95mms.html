    <strong>2020: Just wear a mask it's not that hard. 2002: Just accept government spying on you. If you aren't doing anything wrong you have nothing to hide.</strong>
    <p><p>In both cases the people making the argument completely miss the point. I know wearing a mask isn't hard. I also know that the government could monitor all of my activity and never find anything worth hiding.</p>
<p>It's about freedom.  Leave me alone. I don't care if you're scared of terrorists. Your fear of terrorists doesn't justify me surrendering my privacy.  </p>
<p>Likewise, I don't care if you're scared of Covid.  If you're scared of covid, stay home. If you're scared of terror attacks, stay home.</p></p>

        <p>Mask have actually been proven time and time again to help both the wearer and the person speaking to the wearer. So you‚Äôre probably not killing people but you are likely spreading the disease.  It‚Äôs kind of selfish knowing the virus COULD kill someone and you still refuse to wear a mask. You‚Äôre probably not killing anyone but knowing that you spread an airborne disease and refusing to do anything about it for other people makes you look selfish. You may not be selfish deep down but it definitely makes you look like it.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre wasting your time. They have been told that ‚Äúmasks have been proven‚Äù.  They will never bother to actually investigate studies or they they would know that no study results in anything other than ‚Äúlow certainty‚Äù except for fit tested N95 masks.

        <p>It is selfish. You're saying you won't play nice with others, and they can't make you.</p>
<p>It's so different from all the securities and privacy we lost in the early 2000s... That was the government taking things away from you.</p>
<p>And if the government came in and said "we're going to arrest anybody not wearing a mask" I'd agree with you, this isn't a criminal thing.</p>
<p>For instance, you have every right to wipe your ass with your bare hands, then not wash them, touching everything with your poop fingers. I would ask that you not do that if you're going in public, as is it makes my day to day life nastier in the spaces we share. And I'm 99% sure you'd agree with that sentiment... You would also appreciate it if people didn't make the stores you visit, and surfaces you touch poopy too.</p>
<p>What I'm asking, is that you voluntarily wear a mask in public. What I don't understand is why there's such opposition to just wearing a simple piece of cloth so you don't accidently spread your germs around. It doesn't hurt too wear, doesn't stop you from doing anything, and protects others... What's the actual harm in wearing it?</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily scared of Covid specifically, though I have lost people to it unfortunately. I just don't see how I benefit by not wearing a mask, I only increase my odds of harming myself, increase my odds of harming others, and further the delay of getting our lives back to normal. Every time somebody who didn't know they were infected infects somebody else that's another 2 weeks farther away from normalcy... And I don't know about you, I'm real sick of this economy, and real sick of watching people I know get sick.</p>

<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>

<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0¬†percentage points in 1‚Äì5, 6‚Äì10, 11‚Äì15, 16‚Äì20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

        <p>No, they didn't. I'm looking at this more and they are not accounting for dates or... anything like local mandates. This is pathetic activist research at its finest. No study, ever, should have such an obvious bias like this:</p>
<p>&rt;ur objective is to estimate the excess COVID-19 burden for two groups of states: (1) states with an evidence-based reopening strategy, defined as reopening indoor dining rooms after implementing a statewide masking policy, and (2) states lacking an evidence-based reopening strategy, defined as reopening indoor dining rooms before implementing a statewide masking policy.</p>
<p>And also this baseline presumption which is <em>wholly fucking baseless</em></p>
<p>&rt;hile random variation in testing capacity across states over time is expected, this fluctuation would not bias our estimates unless testing capacity were systematically different after reopening compared to the baseline period. </p>
<p>And then the complete neglect to consider herd immunity:</p>
<p>&rt;The evidence-based group also had experienced greater cumulative COVID-19 burden of cases and deaths per capita on the date of reopening.</p>
<p>This is horrible and the authors should be ashamed. 
As for the mechanics, few if any dispute the mechanics, it's about if those mechanics actually matter, and they don't because of either improper use, presuming droplet spread, or presuming incidental contact is even notable--as in, public spread is near unavoidable if it DOES happen.</p>

        <p>They are experts in PPE though (with decades experience), which certainly gives them a seat at the table. In fact in this matter I don't see how a virologists opinion could be more valuable than theirs. Both know all about the particles involved - sizes, etc. But this is an issue specifically about the mask, and how effective - or ineffective - that is.</p>

        <p>I showed the most up-to-date data on masks, and they all point to that masks help prevent the spread of covid.</p>
<p>OSHA as an organization with all their experts say masks help prevent the spread.</p>
<p>You are just carry picking for the few people who disagree, and also do not have peer-reviewed data backing them up.</p>
<p>Virologists study specifically viruses they are the foremost experts more so than those 2 people who do not have any peer-reviewed data backing their claims.</p>

        <p>Okay, personal stance but I'm skeptical of much of the science coming out of 2020. Look at what happened to HCQ ..Surgisphere, Lancet. Prime example of how compromisable science is, how easily given to certain agendas.</p>
<p>More experts would speak up if doing so would not jeopardize their career.  Look at what happened to Dr. Scott Jensen with the death certificates. Put under review for even questioning the new rules. Obviously we're told the majority of an organization thinks one thing - it doesn't make it the case.</p>
<p>People can believe what they like about masks as far as I'm concerned. The problem is when they're forced, and particularly when the science is far from settled.</p>
<p>And how damaging are these masks to the mental health of young and old people? No reliable science there - and won't be for years, if at all.</p>
<p>But the policies are made regardless.</p>
<p>A very short sighted, knee-jerk response.</p>

        <p>Virtually noone in here objects to voluntary mask wearing, but in the majority of places, wearing a mask is not voluntary, it is mandated under the threat of fines for non-compliance. People have been attacked in the street for not wearing a mask, police have abused people for not wearing a mask. I have absolutely no issue with you voluntarily wearing a mask and I really couldn't give a shit if you think me not wearing one makes me a terrible mass murderer, much like you probably don't care if I think you wearing one makes you a paranoid moron - I only object to mandatory orders, let people choose what they want to do with their own bodies.</p>

        <p>Exactly. We're not just wearing masks, we're wearing masks exactly and only when the government tells us to. And if you choose not to wear it on day 1 of a new mandate, you're suddenly a murderer when yesterday you were just a normal citizen wanting to enjoy your life. Scary stuff this all is.</p>

        <p>It starts out as "I don't understand the constitution and it was written a really long time ago, so I don't see how it can possibly apply to this modern problem", and then leads to a culture of entitlement in law enforcement, where they've had the power to do whatever the fuck they want for so long that they kind of internalize it psychologically and begin to literally look down upon civilians. It compounds on itself because they do often have to interact with some of the worst people in society.</p>
<p>They basically view the founders of the US and the constitution as "wise men who wrote good <strong>guidelines</strong>", and they view people like Ron Paul as some kind of religious fundamentalist because he takes everything in the constitution literally. They basically see the constitution as a religious scripture that has some "good points" here and there, but is not to be taken literally and couldn't possibly apply to the modern world.</p>
<p>The use of dogs is basically them saying "we don't <strong>really</strong> care what you constitutionalists think, but you're politically influential enough to cause us problems if we were to just ignore it completely, so we're going to use dogs so that the voting public thinks we're following the constitution even though we're really not".</p>

        <p>Not "can be" they "are" trained to respond on command. This isn't even conspiracy theory stuff... You have to teach the dog how to respond as well as teach them what to respond to. Otherwise, they smell drugs\bombs and do nothing or do the wrong thing and mess up the search or get people hurt. This means having a command or gesture to force a response.</p>

<p>Sir, my dog has just indicated the presence of drugs.  We now have probable cause to search your vehicle without obtaining a warrant (which isn't hard to get, by the way, on the flimsiest of evidence).  What a scam!</p>

        <p>Sounds like you should look up what an "unreasonable" search of private property is.</p>
<p>David Slansky of Stanford Law School:</p>
<p>‚ÄúFourth Amendment law requires a no-knock search to be based on reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing the presence of the police would be dangerous, pointless, or a threat to the effectiveness of the investigation, for example by leading to the destruction of evidence. But there wasn‚Äôt anything in the affidavit suggesting that Taylor or her current boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were dangerous or that they would destroy evidence or do anything else to obstruct the investigation before letting the police in.‚Äù</p>

        <p>The reason why I told you to actually look into it is because the police knocked and announced themselves.</p>
<p>Literally every case of "police brutality" that has been pushed the last year has been filled with lies, and even when there is indisputable video evidence, you retards act like it doesn't count (see: the shooting in Wisconsin, the shooting of the now crippled racist that Joe Biden views as the average black man).</p>
<p>With that said, the "say her name" folks are the dumbest, because they literally tried to kill Rand Paul while chanting their retarded slogan; even though he literally created a bill to ban no knock warrants in her name, THAT VERY DAY.</p>

        <p>It's disputed whether they actually announced themselves. The original point was about the degradation of the 4th Amendment, and I was merely pointing out that the prior existence of no-knock warrants was an acknowledgement that that Amendment had already been loopholed by an overreaching government.</p>
<p>I have ambivalent feelings towards the BLM protests, but lashing out and referring to people as "retards" always makes it look like you are confident in your opinion.</p>

        <p>That was also what happen in Iran. They started with "it's just X, so don't worry". It shows governments aren't always sure where to draw the line, so people have to show enough is enough and that the government shouldn't go too far with their rules.</p>

People are so fucking deluded now that they don‚Äôt have a problem with armies potentially storming the streets, free speech becoming criminal and police brutality. HOW DID WE GET HERE? Well I mean it‚Äôs obvious this is a plan long in the making and people are happy to give up their freedoms cos they live online. I‚Äôm at a point where if/when the real scheme is entirely out in the open especially once they‚Äôve all had their vaccines and they realize our minority were right and it‚Äôs too late I‚Äôll have zero sympathy for them.

Consider that. Know what they did the the men, women and children who refused to submit? Free speech? When has your speech ever not been controlled. Reddit is run by Cond√© Nast. They‚Äôve literally created a bubble for you and a bunch of friends to view ad content. Armies potentially storming the street? absolutely moronic. We have weaponized tech LOL. Come the fuck on.

        <p>The thing is, I‚Äôve noticed doomers seem to think that because wearing a mask isn‚Äôt hard for <em>them,</em> it isn‚Äôt hard for anyone. If I wear a mask properly, my glasses fog up, I can‚Äôt see, and it‚Äôs difficult for me to breathe properly since I breathe mostly through my mouth, and then in some instances I get a panic attack because my body thinks that I‚Äôm having trouble breathing. I responded with this to a doomer on r/AskReddit and got a bunch of aggressive comments telling me not to be a baby and crap like that. This further shows that they don‚Äôt actually care about others. </p>
<p>On a side note, how the fuck is it not selfish to demand other people wear a mask because you‚Äôre scared? The usual doomer response is ‚Äúbecause it can hurt me.‚Äù Ok, leaving aside all the research showing that masks do nothing, it is not my responsibility to keep you from getting sick. I wouldn‚Äôt ask the same of others, nor would most people during normal times.</p>

        <p>All the research being done right now does point to masks helping slow the spread of covid.</p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06277-0</p>
<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0¬†percentage points in 1‚Äì5, 6‚Äì10, 11‚Äì15, 16‚Äì20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h694.abstract">Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941551/">A review of medical masks and respirators for use during an influenza pandemic</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk of ILI‚Äêassociated infection, with a hazard ratio of 0¬∑26 (95% CI 0¬∑09‚Äì0¬∑77;¬†P‚ÄÉ=‚ÄÉ0¬∑015). A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

<p>Less than two months later they updated their guidelines, based on new information about the virus at hand (not the influenza virus) that masks should be worn to reduce community spread of coronaviruses... https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprevent-getting-sick%2Fcloth-face-cover.html</p>
<p>The CDC goes on to cite 20 publications supporting their recommendation, feel free to evaluate those.</p>
<p>&rt;Not to your liking? Fine, Oxford found cloth masks did not work for source control and may have actually made transmission rates increase in some instances:

&rt;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf
&rt;</p>
<p>Published even earlier than the last one, again looking at a different virus (I will cede ground on the influenza, they're similar in size, and are both enveloped viruses, I would anecdotally expect similar mechanical features) what the publication actually says, the studies available for meta-analysis at that time were poorly constructed, inconclusive, and often terminated early based on poor compliance and improper sample sizes.</p>
<p>&rt;University of Illinois found masks do not work:
&rt;https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data
&rt;</p>
<p>To quote your link "we support the wearing of face coverings by the public when mandated and when in close contact with people whose infection status they don't know." How does that equal "don't wear one, they don't work"</p>
<p>&rt;New England Journal of Medicine analysis also found masks to be ineffective:
&rt;https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372
&rt;</p>
<p>Your link states the improvements are debatable, and alone (without distancing, hand washing, and isolation of potentially sick patients) does very little in the healthcare setting. </p>
<p>I agree with this. When dealing strictly with the otherwise ill, elderly, or immunocompromised, healthcare providers need to be utilizing respirators, full face shields, and disposing of potentially contaminated garments before contacting other patients or other caregivers. The worst thing it said about cloth masks is that they're less effective than respirators by design, and speculated on possible harms and benefits.</p>
<p>&rt;Japanese researchers found masks offer virtually zero protection:
&rt;http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664
&rt;</p>
<p>Again, to quote your article "worn correctly, the leakage rate dropped to about 50%" and "... Such masks do prevent the wearer from spreading droplets by coughing..." 
So they work, albeit not perfectly (again, not a panacea, nothing ever will be) as long as they're worn correctly.</p>
<p>&rt;German scientific eviewer found that they do not help and may in fact create additional risks:

<p>I'll admit, I skipped your last couple links. I'm not trying to spend all day actually reading the links with flashy titles that you shared... But if you read them, at least the first 5 or 6 you provided, they all either state "inconclusive" or show some benefits.</p>
<p>So I guess, in conclusion, how is some benefits the same as "don't work"</p>
<p>Yeah they're not perfect, and if worn incorrectly, then they're as good as nothing (just like a condom, if you put it on wrong you're more likely to end up with a kid or a prescription)</p>

        <p>You ignored the points about how mask wearing can sometimes increase transmissions. The bit of protection they provide goes out the window when you add that in + all the side effects of masks (breathing problems, mask acne, psychological)</p>

        <p>My favorite rebuttal to the masks not causing harm or difficulty breathing is when they quote some study that uses a pulse oximeter to show that masks don't reduce blood oxygen levels.</p>
<p>While that may be an arguable point, all the studies I've seen thus far haven't been able to rule out that masks can cause hypercapnia (excess CO2 caused by rebreathing) because they don't use equipment that can detect said condition. Pulse oximeters can read hypercapnia as adequate oxygen saturation because of a defect in how those machines work.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> make an argument for reduced flow velocity limiting how far things initially spread. But the long duration aerosols are going to stick around either way.</p>

        <p>Not even sure that would be accurate, aerosolised particles just disperse through a mask like water through a sieve. Bigger particles get split into smaller particles and just keep going. If you can breathe through a mask, the viruses are getting through. But this is a mute point anyway, asymptomatic spread isn't a real thing, if you are healthy with no symptoms then you cannot spread anything.</p>

        <p>Aerosols are still carried by advection. The masks slow the overall flow velocity, you can feel this with your hand in front of your face. So instead of a jet you'll get more of a cloud.</p>
<p>But none of that outweighs the downsides of masks. Worthless as source control if you're not sick since you don't have anything to spread in the first place. Causes people to touch their faces more often, potentially increasing infection rates. Mandates being an  infringement on your rights independent of efficacy. Etc.</p>

Every justification for mass masking is because it "doesn't protect you, it protects people around you because droplets through the eyeballs and on surfaces". Well why can't you wear masks, goggles, and gloves if you're so afraid? Why do the rest of us have to suffer because you think goggles are a step too far for you?</p>

        <p>Also what if you have post traumatic stress from some sort of event in your past such as a rape or kidnapping when your face was covered. Do we not care about mental health anymore? What about the poor kid or single women who is hearing impaired and can no longer read lips? What about the disabled  people that are fully grown but can't understand why they need to wear a mask and become violent when somebody touches them. Do we not think these people matter anymore?

        <p>Never said this wasn‚Äôt real. You know what else is real? Cancer. Heart disease. Tuberculosis. Malaria. Ebola. I could go on, but I think the point is clear. Do you know what happens when my glasses fog? I can‚Äôt see. This means I‚Äôm in danger of getting hit by a car, getting mugged, walking into things, etc. To be fair though, none of that is close to as bad as the panic attacks I get when I feel like I‚Äôm not getting enough air. </p>
<p>As for covid, leaving aside the fact that masks do little to nothing, its not that serious for people under 50. This is a proven fact, all you have to do is look up the statistics of who actually dies with covid. In Sweden, 40% were in nursing homes.</p>
<p>And lastly, despite your ill wishes towards my family and I, I hope that you never have to see what actual devastating diseases do to people. If covid was the worst thing that happened to people, this world would be a much better place.</p>

        <p>No offence, but you‚Äôre an idiot if you think that people not wearing masks is what is causing this to last seven months. God, how arrogant are you to think that it‚Äôs possible to eradicate a virus in mere months? If masks were the magical key to this like you people think, then we‚Äôd see a clear difference when mask mandates are put into place. We don‚Äôt. This hypothesis has been disproven so stop clinging to it. I know that it‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs better to admit when you‚Äôre wrong than continue to screw up.</p>

        <p>No, masks aren‚Äôt magic. They won‚Äôt make a virus go away. They may help you hide for a little while, but as soon as you stop hiding viruses will still be there waiting. </p>
<p>So maybe you want to hide forever and that‚Äôs ok. But the rest of us don‚Äôt. So get on amazon and order a N95 mask for those times when you absolutely must come out of hiding to get food or medical attention. Stay Safe!</p>

        <p>Very much so. I don't think most people understand the horrific price paid in blood for the freedoms we enjoy in the West, so they surrender that freedom far too easily assuming it will be theirs again one day. It won't. Never in the history of the human race have our overlords willingly given up power, it has always had to be ripped out of their hands often using chainsaws and shotguns. </p>
<p>These fuck weasels should see the rest of the world and find out what life without freedom really looks like and how hard it is to get freedom when you have none.</p>

        <p>I'm a chemist who works in a lab. Most of my fellow lab mates no longer wear safety glasses because they fog up. So rather than protecting themselves from clear, present danger of splashing chemicals in their eyes, they opt to just wear a mask to protect themselves from a virus that has a &rt;99% chance of survival. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>On top of all of this, due to wearing a mask and having a cut on my face, I ended up getting a staph infection because staph lives in our noses and mouths. So now I need to apply an ointment under my mask. This week has been my breaking point and I am so fed up with these lockdowns and mandates.</p>

        <p>Yeah, no masks for me, but I used to be a chemist working in a lab and you'd never have caught me without safety specs, particularly because I am a clumsy idiot who often fails to read instructions when doing practical work.

        <p>I was having an argument with a friend over masks a few days ago. It‚Äôs not that wearing a mask is all that hard. I do it at work all the time along with living in an incredibly restrictive state so they‚Äôre required absolutely everywhere. But when I asked him ‚Äúwhen are we supposed to stop wearing these? Until there‚Äôs a vaccine? Through flu season?‚Äù And he told me that we should still keep wearing masks even after a vaccine comes out ‚Äújust to be safe‚Äù and that he plans to wear a mask to our wedding next summer. Btw, this friend is 24. This is all just deep brainwashing/programming at this point.</p>

        <p>To be fair, the anti-lockdown sentiment seems to be stronger than ever. Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are the biggies for holidays...at least in the United States. And the thought of all the bullshit security theater dragging into 2021 is appalling for a lot of people. Most people aren‚Äôt exactly jumping at the chance to give up another year of their life.</p>

        <p>I'm tired of people saying "Wearing mask isn't that hard, mate. It's just a piece of cloth". No, it's not that simple as that. Even if I didn't use the "freedom card" it's not that simple. The views I've on mask isn't only about freedom, but also fairness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wearing mask isn't equally easy for everyone for various reasons. May be mental like claustrophobic, anxiety, PTSD, autism and sensory processing disorder. May be physical like deafness or mobility issues like CP.</li>
<li>Communication harder because of facial expressions gets hid. It's particularly difficult for children. Social interaction are important for mental health.</li>
<li>Most people don't know how to use them correctly because of they don't have the same training as doctors.</li>

        <p>In addition to the complete lack of empathy for people who do have issues wearing masks, I also hate the idea that since most people can wear it without passing out it is not harmful. Depriving ourselves of oxygen and increasing carbon dioxide consumption for hours at a time for months or years is not optimal. I worry about the long-term effects, especially for children who are still developing. Sure, our bodies are great at keeping us alive in sub-optimal conditions, but that does not mean we should normalize that. Optimal health is the best defense against COVID and other viruses, and we should be aiming for that, not making our bodies chronically suffer.</p>
<p>Moreover, the heat and moisture created by the masks are perfect breeding grounds for pathogens including COVID.  Masks increase risk of infections for the wearer. Requiring masks to supposedly save others is in effect saying your life matters less than other people's. It is asking people to deny their instincts for self-preservation. </p>
<p>It is so clearly about control and propaganda. People demand masks be worn even in circumstances where social distancing is observed, the area is well-ventilated, and there is therefore no real risk of infection. I've heard people concede that it was possible to socially distance sufficiently without a mask but still demand that masks be worn so that casual observers would not be emboldened to forgo masks. It is about ensuring conformity, not containment.</p>

<p>Their quack obstetrician probably told them that the dreaded long-term effects from the 'rona could be congenital.  And you would have been perfectly justified in telling off these stupid broads, AFAIC.</p>

        <p>Exactly. If you want to wear a mask, go crazy.
 If you want to record everything you say and do and send that to the government voluntarily, be my guest. But leave me alone and stop trying to force me to do either. THAT is selfish.</p>
<p>I am willing to bet that if this "pandemic" WAS actually dangerous, that 90% if not all of this sub would be down to wear a mask, minimize going out, etc. You wouldn't HAVE to force us to do it.</p>

        <p>Even if the pandemic was dangerous, I'd rather live my life and take the chance. People have managed across the centuries with far more dangerous diseases without turning into abject cowering fruit loops with bits of t-shirt material strapped to their faces.</p>
<p>What desperately needs to happen now is for the insane West to understand that each and every one of us is going to die one day and none of us have very much control over when that is - no matter how much we fantasize to the contrary.</p>

        <p>\&rt;I know wearing a mask isn't hard.</p>
<p>It really depends for how long...in what climate...with what complicating conditions.</p>
<p>In a very cold room, seated, stationary, with flawless cardiorespiratory health and no anxiety or panic attack issues, for ten minutes? Sure. That sounds pretty easy.</p>
<p>In a hot atmosphere, exerting oneself physically, with anxiety and panic attack issues, for say, over 24 hours continuously? That's fucking hard.</p>
<p>When trying to connect on a meaningfully level with new people? That's also utterly impossible in masks.</p>
<p>I'm writing this in an airport where I have to wait seven hours for my next flight (flight 2 of 3). I just flew across an ocean overnight from an airport that took me 3 hours to arrive via public transportation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is unbearable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The only place I see where people seem to be allowed to take off their masks is in the smoking lounge!</p>
<p>Masks are no big deal if you have an immense amount of control over your personal environment so you don't have to wear them very often for very long, or if you're a boomer who wears them improperly and figures you wont be called out for it cause your'e old. Otherwise it can be a real imposition.</p>

        <p>I think this is one of the key reasons for the mask mandates. Another way to divide the public  and play us against each other.  Rather than the possibility of  the public uniting and rising up against the ones in power</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt think these are equivalent situations nor are these the proper arguments proponents give. </p>
<p>The proper arguments for both are to ‚Äúsafety of yourself AND others‚Äù. </p>
<p>More importantly I do not believe mask wearing in a‚Äùnew normal‚Äù. </p>
<p>The argument is not compelling enough for spying. </p>
<p>However, just like rationing rubber in WWII, citizens called to patriotic duty temporarily to save lives while a permanent solution is developed is right and within governments right to temporarily mandate. Freedom is not free and soldiers are not the only ones who should pay the price for you. </p>
<p>As to your ‚Äújust stay home‚Äù conclusion ‚Äî not everyone can do that and survive. You might as well say ‚Äújust die‚Äù. </p>
<p>I know this isn‚Äôt the right sub for this point of view, but hopefully you‚Äôll see it as an honest argument and not a troll.</p>

        <p>Except that there is no scientific consensus that masks work and the negative effect has not been studied at all. https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1435/rr-43 They are very had to wear for a portion of the population.

        <p>That was writen in 09 April 2020, we have learned a lot from that from testing.</p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06277-0</p>
<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0¬†percentage points in 1‚Äì5, 6‚Äì10, 11‚Äì15, 16‚Äì20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h694.abstract">Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941551/">A review of medical masks and respirators for use during an influenza pandemic</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk of ILI‚Äêassociated infection, with a hazard ratio of 0¬∑26 (95% CI 0¬∑09‚Äì0¬∑77;¬†P‚ÄÉ=‚ÄÉ0¬∑015). A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

        <p>I agree that the points we often assume the other side is making are reductionist and at times even straw-men. This habit goes both ways, however.</p>
<p>I realize not everyone can stay home. I think what many of us on this sub believe is that there should be economic and medical protections for those who do want to, while the rest of us should be allowed out to fully live our lives, aware but not cowering in fear of an added risk factor in our day to day activities.</p>
<p>All this because the social and economic costs of lockdowns have been tremendous, and without government transparency, we can't rest assured that they will not sow even more devastation in our society.</p>

<p>If the government wants to advise condom wearing, I'm all for it. If they want to mandate condom wearing, your damn right people are going to buck against that and appeal to their individual freedom. </p>

        <p>Do you realize the concept of safety for the overall herd, actually supersedes your childish desire for ‚Äúfreedom to infect others‚Äù. Like, if you don‚Äôt like the responsibility of being part of a society, but enjoy the pleasures, you look like a complete dunce who doesn‚Äôt understand the basics of human cooperation, but will gladly take any viewpoint that allows you to walk around feeling personally special and important. </p>
<p>Nice little echo chamber you have here. You‚Äôre the type of person nobody wants to have as a neighbour, because your entire worldview revolves around you being able to act like a child, while the adults here take care of the country and ensure more people can survive and live happy lives. </p>

        <p>Absolute hypocrisy. We as society have always understood that "freedom" comes at a cost. We trade some of our freedoms for security, safety, and hopefully happiness. It's always been this way. That's literally the price of being a society. There are rules and rules always come at the expense of freedom.</p>
<p>You're no longer allowed to make decisions based on the good of one but the good of many. You can't just lie, steal, kill,(etc.) to get what you want. Not without repercussions from society. And that's the deal we made.</p>
<p>Where was your outrage when they made school mandatory for children. 
Or when we're forced to obtain licenses, register our vehicles etc etc.
Wheres your outage when every male in the U.S. is required to register for the draft in one way or another.</p>
<p>Maybe you shouldn't focus on what you're giving up but what you're gaining. </p>
<p>Yes you are giving up your freedom to not wear a mask but at what cost really? How does it negatively affect you? Or more importantly, how does it negatively affect our society?</p>
<p>Seems to me like we've given up a lot more for a lot less.</p>

        <p>Well that seems pretty straightforward.. we stop the spread of a pandemic causing virus.</p>
<p>And let's not forget that they wore masks during the Spanish Flu and once it was contained, we as a society went back to no masks. </p>
<p>You're being asked to give up a relatively tiny freedom so that everyone, every society benefits.
And once this is all over you'll be back to showing everyone that lovely smile. So just hang in there.</p>

        <p>The goal is to develop a vaccine that will help achieve "herd immunity". Just letting people die until we achieve it naturally is just barbaric. Theres no reason for us to be sacrificing lives.</p>
<p>I get what you're saying in correlation to 9/11 but it's not fair to put them in the same league. The Patriot Act gave the U.S. government powers outside the constitution and some in direct violation. </p>
<p>Maybe I don't see it, but that's why I talk to new people, to gain new insights. But what does Big Brother gain from us wearing masks?
Also want to point out that mask wearing is endorsed by scientists and medical professionals. And is a WORLDWIDE issue so while yes it is theoretically possible that all these people are working together to try to force us into wearing masks but that's highly unlikely and again, what's the point.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone claiming is claiming that masks and social distancing are 100% effective or even that its effective 100% of the time. But it HAS been shown to limit the spread and lessen the amount of virus particles that people come into contact with. </p>
<p>So yeah if you're 6ft away from someone and even if you're both wearing masks, theres a chance you might still get the virus. But the chances of that are way less likely than if the opposite were true. </p>
<p>Hell we still don't know if its transmitted sexually. My point is that we can only deal with the information we have. Scientists and medical professionals worldwide have spoke to the effectiveness of masks and social distancing. </p>
<p>But I get it, unbiased facts are hard to come by nowadays. In the end, it's up to each and everyone of us to form our own opinions and make a decision.</p>

<p>This is my issue with mandates (I don‚Äôt care if you choose to wear a mask)... many scientists and medical professionals do NOT endorse mask mandates. And many of those who <em>do</em> endorse them do so after <strong>explicitly</strong> acknowledging that the evidence for masks is, at very best, inconclusive. </p>
<p>Have you independently researched the available evidence on the efficacy of masks? As in, have you actually googled and read a broad selection of peer-reviewed studies and systematic reviews on masks? </p>
<p>(I specify ‚Äúbroad‚Äù because one study proves nothing either way; a single study can be designed to ‚Äúprove‚Äù anything. To reach an evidence based conclusion it is necessary to consider the <em>totality</em> of the available evidence.)</p>
<p>Or have you simply accepted someone else‚Äôs (a journalist, a doctor, a researcher, doesn‚Äôt matter) assertion that the effectiveness of masks is ‚Äúproven‚Äù?</p>

        <p>I try to check as many sources as possible and at least checking 3 different sources. Everything I've read has shown masks and/or social distancing are at least more effective than doing neither.</p>
<p>I can agree that mask mandates are a government overreach. To me the government really shouldn't be telling it's people what it can and can't do. That's up to us as a society. We as a society should be able to decide.</p>

        <p>I encourage you to check more sources. There‚Äôs a fascinating situation here. Prior to mask mandates, it was well-known that the evidence for masks was not there ... and not for lack of trying. We started using masks well over a century ago, and in the early 1900s someone decided it‚Äôd be neat to get some evidence for the practice. So they tried. Over and over, for a century with consistent results in many different studies, including a significant number of RCTs: no evidence of effectiveness. This lack of evidence was so strong that hospitals/medical pros around the world <em>actively</em> questioned why hospitals spend so much money on masks (the common answer: no evidence but it still really seems like a good idea).  When Fauci said there was no benefit to universal masking, he wasn‚Äôt lying to save masks for health care workers - he was stating the <em>long</em> established, strongly supported view of the scientific community on masks. </p>
<p>Then masks were mandated, and we got a whole bunch of new studies showing how effective they are. Except these studies were lab simulations, case studies, and retrospectives - studies that do not apply to real-world scenarios, are heavily subject to bias (particularly cherry picking), and/or show correlation but not causation. Not all studies are equal or deserve the same weight; these studies do not override the extensive body of RCTs showing no effect. </p>
<p>So almost 100 years of high quality research almost all of which shows no effectiveness vs a few months of low quality research conducted post-government recommendation all showing effectiveness. That‚Äôs the totality of the evidence, and I do not think it supports a conclusion that masks are effective to <em>any</em> significant degree. </p>
<p>But if you agree that masks mandates are a government overreach, then that‚Äôs a strong common ground. I fully support your right to choose to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>After checking additional resources I've come to the same conclusion about masks. If you would be willing to provide some additional links that support your case, I'd appreciate that.</p>
<p>I read an oxford research study, a study done by the New Zealand government and then broad review (and simplification) of around 3000 independent studies. All of these were pre-2018.</p>
<p>I'm on mobile and don't know how to post links or else I would. Even though these studies varied on whether traditional medical masks offered protection or not, they all agreed that by wearing masks you limit the spread.</p>

<p>u/WillBeYourHoboJoe made a substantive argument in a civil manner - that should never be discouraged, even when you disagree with it. </p>
<p>I also object to the comparison to a religion.

        <p>LOL </p>
<p>But seriously, if you consider a polite, thoughtful comment a threat to your views/values, then they aren‚Äôt particularly strong. If your position is based on strong values, reasoning, and evidence, then he can try all he wants but he won‚Äôt succeed.</p>

        <p>Sure, but in my opinion all you‚Äôre doing is making us look bad (and using the same flawed thought process as a doomer). </p>
<p>The key part of that tagline is ‚Äúthinkers.‚Äù </p>
<p>A thinker must in fact think. </p>
<p>For this thought to be of any value, it must be rational, evidence-based, and account for <em>all</em> arguments and evidence - not just the ones we like because they support our conclusion.  More importantly, to avoid becoming dogmatic and devoted to conclusions that are no longer warranted, it is necessary to be self-critical in our thinking and honestly question ourselves. Are we dismissing an argument or evidence because we have strong reasons to do so, or because it doesn‚Äôt fit with what we want to be true? </p>
<p>Your position - we‚Äôve made up our minds and aren‚Äôt interested in questioning anything - is <strong>exactly</strong> what‚Äôs wrong with doomers: they formed an opinion and are committed to that opinion, so any argument, any evidence that doesn‚Äôt support their opinion is dismissed out of hand. If they were thinking rationally, very few of them would still be doomers. </p>
<p>You‚Äôve reached the right conclusion here but are displaying the exact same approach to thinking as a doomer. You‚Äôre better than that.</p>

        <p>He's the type who comes in here already thinking that we're assholes and scum for resisting the new normal he is not here to exchange ideas in an open-minded setting he is just here to troll and be contrarian. Why would I respect or acknowledge someone who advocates for the policies and restrictions that I am currently fighting back against?    </p>
<p>We need to hold these types accountable you don't' see me or many others on this subreddit going to /r/coronavirus or /r/covididiots and telling them that they are delusional and hysterical do you, but you see types like him going into subreddits like this or /r/conspiracy just mucking up the place and being a troll.</p>

        <p>From what I can tell of his comments here, he actually seemed interested in having a sincere discussion. I don‚Äôt read minds so I don‚Äôt know anyone‚Äôs intentions, I make judgments solely on what I see. If he‚Äôd been rude or insulting or closed to actual discussion, I‚Äôd agree with you - but he wasn‚Äôt. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôre fighting against things, but preaching to the chorus (which is what happens when you build echo chambers) doesn‚Äôt count as doing anything, and certainly not ‚Äúfighting.‚Äù I want these policies and restrictions to end, and therefore I care about getting more people to share my views. That can‚Äôt happen without talking to them.</p>

        <p>&rt; Yes you are giving up your freedom to not wear a mask but at what cost really? How does it negatively affect you? Or more importantly, how does it negatively affect our society?</p>
<p>Because it's an infringement on the most baseline rights of a person. Jesus Christ, you're demanding I put something over my face because a 95 year old has a 5% of dying if they get something <em>I do not have</em>. </p>
