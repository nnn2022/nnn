    <strong>Domestic Violence cases have skyrocketed during lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>In virtually every country, domestic violence has skyrocketed due to lockdowns. I have yet to see a single politician talk about this. </p>
<p>USA- “physicians at a large hospital in Boston saw a near-doubling of the proportion of domestic abuse cases that resulted in physical injury in comparison with previous years. The injuries were also dramatically more severe, prompting concerns that victims had delayed seeking care even as the violence against them escalated.” </p>
<p>UK- “Two-thirds of women in abusive relationships have suffered more violence from their partners during the pandemic” and “Three-quarters of victims also say the lockdown has made it harder for them to escape their abusers.” </p>
<p>Australia- “National research by the Australian Institute of Criminology found one in ten women in a relationship said they had experienced intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Half of those women said the abuse had increased in severity since the outbreak of the pandemic in Australia.”</p>
<p>Japan- “Over 13,000 women reported that they experienced domestic violence in April alone, which is 1.3 times higher than in the same period last year. Like all statistics on domestic violence, however, incidences can be vastly under-reported, especially because seeking help for "family matters" is still a taboo in Japanese society.”</p>
<p>South Africa- “Domestic abuse is a huge problem in South Africa - at least eight women are murdered by their partners everyday. And In the past four weeks, the number of women reporting abuse has doubled, as the country's Covid-19 lockdown forces them to stay at home with their abusive partners.”</p>
<p>Israel- “The numbers of complaints have jumped from eight a week to 73 a day within less than two months” (during lockdown)</p>
<p>Canada- “He hits me, he chokes me, he throws me on the stairs,” said Sadia, whose identity has been protected for this story. Her husband, a truck driver, used to be on the road for work. But the pandemic changed all of that. Her torment has intensified since his work stopped. “It's not been easy since he came home,” she said. “Before the coronavirus hit, I felt safe because he's not around.” (personal story from a woman in Canada)</p>
<p>I obviously couldn’t include every country, but I wanted to try and bring more awareness to this topic. Links below to all my quotations if you want to learn more.</p>

<p>Also noteworthy was the post on this sub about rape survivors having PTSD with being forced into masks, and r/coronavirus comments were literally supporting the abuse.</p>

        <p>Heck yeah they were. And ironically i just had a person over there tell me i was "weak" for posting links to studies about how we should be wearing masks at home. I asked them what was so difficult about wearing a little piece of cloth over their nose and mouth inside their house and so far, no response. Only downvotes. Hypocrisy in action. Never in my life have i dealt with more candy-butt mf'ers.</p>

        <p>Much as I hate to admit it, #metoo days were much better.</p>
<p>Covid is apparently the cure to:</p>
<p>-Domestic violence</p>
<p>-Deadly diseases such as Cancer, HIV, Heart Attacks</p>
<p>-Mental issues</p>
<p>-Garbage and pollution</p>
<p>Of freaking course if you have people fired and not working they'll fight. Even HEALTHY couples are going to fight if they have to be together all the time.</p>
