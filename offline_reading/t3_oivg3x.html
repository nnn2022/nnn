    <strong>r/Science Thread Manipulation?</strong>
    <p><p>I posted a reply to a comment in the below post and obviously expected downvotes; however, after seeing the downvotes hit ca. 30 last night, my karma never went down. </p>
<p>The comment then disappeared from 'new' in my 'profile' page - only to be seen in the 'comments' page.</p>
<p>Checked back today and the post has been purged of all comments but still shows mine as being there (under a comment removed by moderator)</p>
<p>I clearly wasn't shadow-banned as I still got downvotes on the comment (even though they didn't reflect in my overall karma) but is there some way to explain what happened here? </p>

        <p>The reason for your post removal should have said..."Your post has been removed because it does not support the Leftist narrative.  And since the facts you have used cannot be refuted it may in fact wake up some of the brain dead to the truth"  The comment threads were probably removed because they did contain some factual things that just couldn't be brushed away in support of the narrative.  We have to keep the marginally brain dead completely shielded from reality and therefore censorship is required.</p>

        <p>You are 100% correct; however, the weird thing is they didn't actually remove my comments so I haven't even seen a reason. </p>
<p>It seems they deleted the post &amp; removed all comments except for mine, which is why I find it so strange.</p>

        <p>It looks like they just removed your the thread of comments. I can't see yours anywhere, maybe I missed it?</p>
<p>/r/science is a propaganda sub. There is a clear agenda in more than half the studies they post, I mean this is obvious from the post you link to as well - which is ironic.</p>

        <p>Yeah I feel you. I usually avoid commenting in the main propaganda subs but the na√Øve part of me desperately wants r/Science to at least feign neutrality in view of it's fucking name.</p>
