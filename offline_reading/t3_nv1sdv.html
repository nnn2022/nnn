        <p>After this fiasco, I'm not so sure that any top-down, authoritarian approach to public health would be remotely desirable.</p>
<p>The government needs to cease with the notion that it is responsible for it's citizens health and that it knows best. We have to return the principle that each individual is responsible for their own health choices and that the government's only involvement is impartial recommendation/facilitation of services.</p>

        <p>While I am very much in favor of individual choice wherever possible, what about situations where one person's choice puts others at risk?</p>
<p>For example, one could argue that drunk driving should be an individual's choice. They should decide if they want to take that risk. But how is that fair to others who are also put at risk through little to no choice of their own? I suppose this analogy could be replaced with many other examples.</p>

        <p>How can we be a nation of strong moral standing if we coerce and force sacrifice from unwilling individuals?</p>
<p>Did anyone ask the youngest generation if they were OK with having their social and personal development irreparably damaged before we shut everything down?</p>
<p>Did anyone ask small business owners if they were OK with sacrificing their life's work so that we could shut down? </p>
<p>Did anyone ask the victims of domestic abuse, people with mental disabilities, or people with non-COVID health problems if they were OK with being trapped in their houses under dangerous conditions?</p>
<p>Why did the elderly and infirm not have to sacrifice for these groups and risk getting the disease so that society could keep functioning? </p>
<p>Why is only one group of people worthy of sacrifice in this country, and why were the rest of us never given a choice as to whether or not we would make those sacrifices for them?</p>
<p>How is that moral, and where is that morality derived from?</p>
<p>Is it moral to force people to sacrifice against their will? </p>
<p>It is not, and I believe we collectively acknowledged that in the US after the Vietnam War. We recognized the moral wrongdoing there, and we no longer conscript unwilling men to sacrifice their lives in our wars. </p>
<p>We need to do the same here now. It is long past time to abandon this position of involuntary altruism.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the Constitution may or may not say, it does not preempt natural rights. Nobody can force sacrifice from another and retain the moral high ground.</p>

        <p>No one asked them because their feelings and opinions don't matter. What matters is protecting the people as a whole from a global pandemic.</p>
<p>I don't even know what to say about your suggestion that sacrificing the lives of the elderly should be done so you don't have to sacrifice your "freedom" by wearing a mask or staying inside. Such a position is ludicrous on its face.</p>
<p>The greater "morality" is in protecting lives of the many rather than the feelings of the few.</p>
<p>Finally yes, our laws do preempt "natural rights". Don't like it? Leave. But of course you will continue to benefit from roads, fire dept, mail, electricity and all the other things society provides because you have not the strength of your convictions to do anything else</p>

        <p>Why do the lives of the elderly and infirm matter more than others? Do the lives of people that died as a direct result of arbitrary pandemic measures count less than old people that died from COVID?</p>
<p>What objective morality do you derive that from? </p>
<p>Did God come down from the sky and give you a tablet with the official ranking of whose life matters most? </p>
<p>If he did, you had better come public with it, because you are the chosen one, and we need you to show us all the truth that we are so blind to.</p>
<p>Oh wait - that's all your opinion. Who the hell are you to define what freedom is? </p>
<p>Maybe freedom to me is existing in my natural form and/or not being caged up like a criminal for a crime I have never been convicted of committing. Maybe it isn't. It is not your right to force me to appease your neuroses.</p>
<p>And no, manmade laws do not preempt natural rights. You may think they do, but they don't. You will see that one day. At most, they might infringe upon them, but they cannot preempt them. Nor would you want them to.</p>
<p>The truth is, you are OK with these arbitrary violations of freedom and bodily autonomy because they do not currently harm you. You are a member of the in-group right now, so you are happy with what is going on.</p>
<p>If you give the government the level of power to where they can choose what you do with your body, it will be invariably used against you. You must not be a student of history.</p>
<p>And I lack strength and conviction? People like you have no place to talk about those traits.</p>
<p>I can promise you that you will never personally be putting a mask onto someone's face, forcefully vaccinating them, or locking them in their house.</p>
<p>You do not have the strength to do so, nor the conviction in your beliefs to risk what you know would happen if you tried. You don't care enough about your beliefs to personally fight for them.</p>
<p>The best a coward like yourself can ever do is have the government do it on your behalf, because you don't truly have any conviction in your beliefs. </p>
<p>You have a violence and power fetish that you are unable to fulfill yourself because you are impotent and weak. You have to live it out vicariously through government actions.</p>
<p>You are not unique, and you are not special. You are nowhere near the first narcissistic COVID cultist I have met on here that believes that they are 100% morally right while relishing in the suffering of others they deem inferior.</p>
<p>Believe me, I will be leaving this worthless immoral society and living away from this shit. </p>
<p>I'm sick and tired of having to share it with narcissistic, pathetic, egotistical sycophants such as yourself who believe that their faux morality (that exists only to rationalize their own inexcusable actions/beliefs) gives them authority to dominate others. </p>
<p>You can rot in your authoritarian hell-hole while I live freely as nature and God intended. </p>
<p>You will reap what you sow. One day, as you so eloquently put it, your "feelings and opinions won't matter." One day, you will be the one in the cross-hairs of the in-group that no longer considers you a member. </p>
<p>Don't say I didn't warn you. One day, you will be the one that "doesn't matter."</p>

        <p>Explain how that was supposed to work. <br>
Step 1 sacrifice the elderly <br>
Step 2 TBD<br>
Step 3 Profit?</p>
<p>I'm narcissistic? Yet it is you who say the elderly should have died so you don't have to wear a mask. Help me make sense of this idea. How does the death of old people stop covid? How would it make things better?<br>
BTW, no one ever forced a mask on anyone, forced a vaccination, or locked anyone in their house. That's just crazy BS from an unhinged mind.<br>
I especially love your natural law argument of "Nuh uh. No it's not". Was that found in some ancient great tome of wisdom?<br>
Oh yeah, god is imaginary. Stop using imaginary ideas as points in your argument. You sound unbalanced.<br>
I'm very happy I made you mad enough to insult someone you never met. Your anger at common sense thought is delicious. Yay!<br>
"Believe me, I will be leaving this worthless immoral society and living away from this shit" do you have a timeline for this fantasy of yours or are you waiting for god to tell you what to do?</p>

        <p>I do not want the elderly or infirm to die. You are putting words in my mouth.  I believe that we should do as much as possible to protect them, but that such sacrifice must be voluntary. Nothing more, nothing less. </p>
<p>And once again, why are the lives of the elderly more important than everyone else's? What authority (besides your own opinion) do you have to claim that?</p>
<p>If pandemic measures work, they should be promoted, but optional. People are inherently good - they will tend to try to help others if given the chance. </p>
<p>We see this during natural disasters when people come to donate blood/supplies and rebuild without being forced to do so.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the capable to help the weak, but it must never be forced or coerced.</p>
<p>If you give someone the power to force or coerce sacrifice, you give them power to do unimaginable harm.</p>
<p>This government is comprised of a number of the most corrupt individuals in the history of the world. Why in the hell would you want them to have control over your body?</p>
<p>And nobody forced anyone to stay at home? So all of those lockdown orders throughout the US and the rest of the world have been myth? </p>
<p>All of the police raids on businesses that remained open never happened? No business owners were arrested and had their businesses shut down for not complying with closures and other pandemic measures?</p>
<p>In any regard, my point was that you were not the one having to put themselves in harm's way to enforce those mandates (or any others.) And you never will be, because you have no conviction for your beliefs.</p>
<p>And no, God is not imaginary, nor is objective morality, nor is natural law. You can deny their existences, but that doesn't mean that they are not real. Some deny the spherical shape of the Earth, but that does not make it flat.</p>
<p>There is obvious proof of God's existence, but acknowledging it will require you to admit that worshipping man and his creation is inherently harmful and wrong. So that isn't likely to happen. You worship yourself too much to ever admit that there is a source of morality superior to your own.</p>
<p>"Common sense thought" is objective morality which you evidently don't ascribe to. You believe that your beliefs are 100% infallible, and that anyone who doesn't agree with them is wrong. </p>
<p>I have no anger towards you. Anger is not the right word.</p>
<p>You wish for people like me to live at the pleasure of your whims. You are OK with tyrants harming me if I do not comply.</p>
<p>Anger is not the right word for what I feel about people that espouse those beliefs. The proper term for what I feel is concerned.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the consequences of being part of a society primarily comprised of people who believe that they hold dominion over my body. </p>
<p>I am going to protest those beliefs at every opportunity, and I am going to be animated when doing so. My freedom and autonomy depends on people like you never getting control over my body.</p>
<p>So no, you are wrong. I am not angry at you. I am concerned about what people like you will do to people like me should you get the chance.</p>
<p>And you can dismiss me as a madman all you'd like; it won't change the fact that objective morality exists. </p>
<p>Sin exists, and does not require some eternal post-mortem hell to punish one who sins. Sinners are punished here on Earth as a direct consequence of their actions. </p>
<p>That is why it is objective - if it is inherently wrong, the punishment for doing it must be inherent as well. The punishment for sin is not hypothetical - it is guaranteed.</p>
<p>You will not be punished by some magical bearded guy in the sky. That is ridiculous, and it is not God. It is a creation of man, and it is false.</p>
<p>You are living a sinful life. Like I said in my last post, you will reap what you sow. One day, the authoritarian government you supported will decide that you "no longer matter," and will use your own words against you.</p>
<p>That will be the punishment for your sin - you will become a victim of your own actions. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>And yes, I do have a timeline and a plan, why wouldn't I? I don't expect someone else to take care of my problems, like you seem to need. I don't expect that the government will come in and do my bidding.</p>

        <p>"I do have a timeline and a plan."</p>
<p>Please accelerate your plan. If you need help, I'm here for you.</p>
<p>I've not sinned. Not by any Christian standard. "Love thy neighbor as thy love thyself", so you know, I think my neighbors should not be exposed to danger just because someone screams "freedom" while refusing to take basic safety measures. </p>
<p>But sure, let's tell the elderly, many of whom don't know what year it is, if they need to be protected from disease, they have to ask for it. Or, let's ask them to sacrifice themselves because someone somewhere thinks it will help somehow.</p>
<p>BTW, there is no objective anything anywhere. </p>
<p>"Why in the hell would you want them to have control over your body?"</p>
<p>Yeah, I agree. Who told them they get to decide who can and can't have an abortion, change their gender, or commit suicide? My problem is with the people whose decisions put me and my family at risk due to their own self delusions and interests during a global pandemic. Playing politics with the lives of your neighbors because of your own sense of "freedom"? Would Jesus do that?</p>
<p>"And once again, why are the lives of the elderly more important than everyone else's?"</p>
<p>Because the bible said so? <br>
"you who are younger, be subject to the elders"<br>
 "You shall stand up before the gray head and honor the face of an old man, and you shall fear your God: I am the Lord."</p>

        <p>"Love thy neighbor as you love yourself" is great advice. But it must not be coerced or forced. It must be voluntary. </p>
<p>As I said before: the strong have have a duty to help the weak, but it must be of their own volition. No government should have the power to coerce or force sacrifice, or we will invariably end with that power being abused.</p>
<p>How is it loving your neighbor to say that the only people whose lives matter are the elderly, as you said in one of your last posts? </p>
<p>Are your neighbors under the age of 65 not worthy of your Christian love? Is it Christian to set an age limit for when life becomes dignified and worthy of respect?</p>
<p>Or is the truth that you do not identify with anyone but those perceived to be weak, and you have no love or care for anyone else? </p>
<p>Are all lives not equal? </p>
<p>And yes, objective morality exists. You can claim that objective truths do not exist, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they do. </p>
<p>You could also claim that gravity is not objective, but I promise you that if you jump, you will not start floating away.</p>
<p>God and objective morality are just forces of nature, no different from gravity. Whether or not you deny their existences, they will still be here.</p>
<p>In terms of abortion, suicide, or gender changes, I am not opposed to those. You mistake me for an authoritarian who believes I hold dominion over the bodies of others. </p>
<p>You should have complete control over your body, and once this "New Normal" has been dealt with, I will be protesting against limitations on those things as well.</p>
<p>In terms of "playing politics" with people's lives - I do not adhere to current pandemic measures because that would mean that I would be complicit in making the powers that be even more powerful. I refuse to do that. </p>
<p>I believe that capable people should willingly sacrifice to help the incapable. </p>
<p>Until that sacrifice is no longer being forced or coerced, the greater threat to life is the consolidation of power in the hands of corrupt individuals who will then use "the greater good" as a weapon.</p>
<p>The mass murders committed by authoritarian governments in the 20th century are excellent examples of what happens when "the greater good" preempts individual autonomy. </p>
<p>The 100 million plus death toll of those regimes is far greater than anything COVID might cause. Given the technology today, an authoritarian US government behaving similar to the USSR, Nazi Germany, Maoist China, or communist Cuba could wipe out far more than any of those nations were able to.</p>
<p>Once the public has given this government the power to arbitrarily harm to further the "greater good," we will see harm perpetrated at a level previously unknown to man. </p>
<p>This cannot be allowed, and this is the final stand to keep individual autonomy ahead of the "greater good" and prevent such a future from happening. </p>
<p>If we fail here, it will forever be lost. I cannot in good conscience show obedience to such a blatant power grab as we are seeing now. </p>
<p>Until all measures are entirely voluntary and free of coercion or force, I will not participate, and anyone who is a student of history will agree with me that we cannot stand for this.</p>
<p>Lastly, I believe that you mistake what true religion is. The Bible is a creation of man, not a definitive edict regarding objective morality. Jesus was just a man. He is not God, at least not any more so than the rest of us.</p>
<p>The Bible is just a collection of parables. It tells stories that we can glean wisdom from, but it should be looked at as such.</p>
<p>Objective morality and God do not come from a book. They just are. </p>
<p>In the same way that gravity does not exist because a science textbook says it does, objective morality and God do not exist because the Bible says they do. </p>
<p>I do not find your quote to be in opposition to what I have said. It simply says to respect the elderly.</p>
<p>I have said repeatedly that the capable have a duty to help the incapable. The powers that be must not have the ability to force or coerce such sacrifice. </p>
<p>If a Bible verse (that you evidently don't believe in) is needed, however, here is one for you.</p>
<p>"It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin." - Luke 17:2</p>
<p>Should the elderly force/coerce the young into sacrificing for them, they permit the government to become too powerful. The government will invariably cause incalculable harm once it obtains that power. </p>
<p>By forcing the young to be complicit in such a power grab, the elderly would be forcing them to live in a state of sin.</p>
<p>This verse here describes how the elderly must sacrifice themselves to keep the younger generations from falling into a state of sin. </p>
<p>Even if it means their death, it is their duty to protect the younger generations and permit them to live as moral of a life as possible.</p>
<p>The elderly have a duty to risk their lives to preserve the freedoms of the younger generations, and the younger generations have a responsibility to risk themselves to save the elderly.</p>
<p>You will probably say something along the lines of "well, the elderly are being forced to sacrifice their lives to preserve freedom. Why is that OK, but it isn't OK to force the young to sacrifice their freedom for the lives of the elderly?"</p>
<p>The answer is quite simple. You would be presenting a false dichotomy. The young can (and often do) WILLINGLY sacrifice to save the elderly. A lack of force/coercion does not mean that people will not try to help others.</p>
<p>They can (and should) participate in willing sacrifice. In a world without coerced/forced sacrifice, the young who did not help the elderly and incapable would be morally wrong for abdicating that responsibility. </p>
<p>Should they be coerced or forced into doing so against their will by a government? Absolutely not. </p>
<p>That is all I am saying - nothing more, nothing less. The elderly should be protected, and the young must not be forced to sacrifice.</p>
<p>Until this attempted power grab (under the guise of empathy) ends, I will not obey any pandemic rules, and I will encourage others to not do so as well. </p>
<p>Until autonomy and freedom have been protected, one must not be complicit to the "public health measures" that deprive us of dominion over our bodies.</p>

<p>Yet you talk about the "duty" people have to protect or sacrifice for others. That's what we call hypocrisy. You are the REASON we have to have rules. Because without them, people cannot be expected to do the right thing... just like you</p>

        <p>It is not hypocrisy.</p>
<p>If we do not do something to prevent this power grab, those elderly and infirm that you value so much will be liquidated once the government gets sick of supporting them. </p>
<p>The only way to potentially save them is to maintain freedom and individual autonomy.</p>
<p>If we remain free, we can voluntarily come together to provide for the incapable. </p>
<p>If not, the government will be responsible for ensuring their survival, and if you care about those people then you definitely do not want that to happen. There is a long history of that never ending well.</p>
<p>The point of liquidation is coming very soon, given that most Western nations have aging populations close to or below replacement rate. </p>
<p>We literally cannot maintain a functioning society with so many people that require intensive care and produce nothing of value to pay for it. Our social welfare programs are expected to be insolvent in the future. </p>
<p>Something must give - and the wealthy will not be giving up their fortunes. They will simply cut some costs, and those costs will be the people who cannot provide for themselves.</p>
<p>Just like Boxer in Orwell's Animal Farm, once the elderly or infirm are no longer productive in an authoritarian society, they are liquidated. </p>
<p>This happens every single time a government gets this type of power. They cull those who are no longer productive. </p>
<p>These "compassionate" governments do not give a damn about the weak that they claim to champion. They only care about stealing power from the individual. </p>
<p>Every chance they get, they fail to help those that they claim to be enacting these authoritarian policies to protect. </p>
<p>Read up on how a substantial portion of the deaths in nursing homes in Ontario during the pandemic have been as a result of neglect. </p>
<p>By some estimates, more elderly people in Ontario nursing homes have died from neglect than COVID since the start of the pandemic. </p>
<p>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-military-report-documents-deplorable-conditions-at-two/</p>
<p>Ontario has had one of the strictest responses to COVID in the Western Hemisphere, supposedly to "protect the weak." </p>
<p>This was the best they could do? The help sent by the government was too little, too late. </p>
<p>In the words of one director of an Ontario nursing home, "emergency help from the Armed Forces and a Toronto hospital did not come until weeks after" his plea for help.</p>
<p>Despite having the power to bully everyday people for living their lives normally, they were unable to send anyone out to give "water and a wipe down" until dozens of residents had already died of dehydration. </p>
<p>They do not give a damn about protecting the weak, or they would not be letting them die from such easily preventable causes. </p>
<p>They literally are letting the elderly and weak die of starvation and dehydration because they don't bother to ensure even the bare minimum conditions for these people.</p>
<p>So much for "saving grandma."</p>
<p>All they cared about was consolidating the power that they stole from individuals. </p>
<p>They prey on the good will of thoughtful people and convince them that they need to give up autonomy in order to help others, because they never would have given that control away under normal circumstances. </p>
<p>Do not believe their lies.</p>
<p>The lives of the infirm and incapable will be forfeit if nothing is done to keep power out of the hands of those who put a price tag on human life.</p>
<p>If the government gains the power it desires, the unproductive will not be seen as human beings worthy of dignity but rather depreciated assets to be discarded with last month's garbage.</p>
<p>Should we fight against coerced/forced sacrifice and win, we will still have a chance to save the lives of the elderly and infirm.</p>
<p>We can (and will) do so voluntarily, because people are inherently good.</p>
<p>Should we fail to do so, their lives are guaranteed to be forfeit. </p>
<p>Whether they die from COVID or liquidation, they will still be dead. Death is death.</p>
<p>At least there will still be a chance to save them from COVID (or any other future malady) should individual autonomy be preserved. </p>
<p>There will be no saving them from the culling that is guaranteed to occur when an authoritarian government decides that the unproductive are a net loss.</p>
<p>Disobedience against this attempt at consolidating power gives the unproductive a chance. It may seem to be a selfish decision in the moment, but long term, it is the best method of ensuring that these people survive. </p>
<p>In order to preserve the freedom of the capable AND the human worth of those deemed unproductive, we must fight against this unholy power grab that threatens all of us.</p>

        <p>Cage? Come one man, don't be so dramatic. Keeping a safe distance and wearing a mask is hardly a cage. If this is the depth of your hardship, your life has been pretty good.</p>
<p>I never said freedom doesn't exist. I said it's red herring. Go ahead and look the term up... I'll wait.</p>
<p>OK good, now that you know what a red herring actually is, perhaps you can understand why I think it has nothing to do with the subject at hand. No one has lost a single freedom.  No one has been arrested for not wearing a mask. No one has been arrested for not social distancing. No one has lost a freedom. Stop pretending they have. </p>
<p>You are simply being told what to do to keep your neighbors safe. If you don't like it that's ok. You don't have to wear a mask. You don't have to social distance. You can go live isolated somewhere. But if you want to enjoy the fruits of the society we have all built, you have to play by the rules society has laid down for you. Your choice.</p>

Now as for you telling me no one has lost a freedom, let me ask you this, doesn't the first amendment cover freedom of religious practices as free association, and haven't the churches been prohibited from meeting at full capacity, and fined for meeting to worship in the manner their religion mandates? But here you are, still saying that people have to act the way you want, or they should be segregated.....</p>

        <p>No. Just no. Your silly argument that doing the right thing is some sort of gilded cage is just a bucket of snowflake tears. <br>
Religious practices are not a free for all. we have always enforced rules on what is and is not acceptable. But if your church thinks getting their weekly tithe from it's members is more important that the health of their members, I see that as a good reason to put a stop to that kind of insanity. Good Christians/Muslims/Jews etc etc care about their neighbors and try to do the right thing for the community. They also know that they can worship at home because god does not live in the church. Your religious freedom has nothing to do with going to church. Unless you don't understand your faith obviously.</p>

        <p>Stop, you don't get to declare it the right thing without defending it as right. You haven't, you've just declared it as the only right thing. It isn't. It is violation of human rights of freedom. Also, you might want to look at how SCOTUS has interpreted freedom of religion before you start declaring what isn't allowed, cause you are wrong. You also completely misrepresent the very character of religion by making it all about a tithe (which, by the way, you clearly know nother about) you are right that God doesn't live ONLY in the church building (cause the church is the people, not the building) but you miss the mark by not knowing that they are Commanded to gather, and that corporate (as in 'body of the church' meaning communal) worship is a central part of most Christian denominations. But sure, you wanna tell me I don't know anything about it, while showing several layers of ignorance about the entire topic.... I'll pray for you to gain clarity and wisdom.</p>

        <p>ok here is my argument that it's the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Millions died due to diseases like smallpox and polio until we created a vaccine and forced people to take it. Now, millions don't have to die. See how that works? Or maybe life has no value to you and you aren't really the faithful and humble servant of god you pretend to be. It's hard to tell.</p>
<p>I never painted religion as "all about a tithe". But can you tell me why else you have to go to the same building to worship when the bible said to pray in private and that public prayer was false faith. What faith based value places visiting a building over the safety of the community? I'd really like to read that passage.  </p>
<p>Here is one for you.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.‚Äù (Romans 13:1‚Äì2 ESV)</p>
<p>The terms in this passage could not be any clearer: God commands his people to be subject to the governing authorities. To resist those authorities is to resist God.</p>
<p>As for your "commanded" crud, you need to learn your own religion. There is no ‚Äúcommand‚Äù in Hebrews 10:24-25. <em>The main verb is in the subjunctive, which generally has the sense of an encouragement, as reflected in all literal translations. The Apostle is encouraging a group of people to consider how they may increase in mutual love, consideration and humble service toward one another. To state the obvious, there is no direct command mandating large congregational worship gatherings on a 7-day rotation.</em></p>
<p>And again, the book says to increase your consideration and humble service towards one another. Maybe you should read that again. Go ahead. Read it again. You are using a passage to insist you must go to church when the message of that passage is to spread love and good works. Not spreading illness among your neighbors is a great way to demonstrate your faith and obedience to God. You have fallen a long way brother. Take inventory of your own ignorance. And stop virtue signaling by saying you will pray for me. </p>
<p>"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. ... But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."</p>

<p>You use a passage about private prayer, which I tend to agree with to refute a point about worship, where you are completely wrong. Prayer and worship are very different things. I don't blame you for not understanding religions you aren't a member of, but will caution you against trying to argue how a religion works if you don't actually have the underlying understanding of said religion.</p>
<p>On your use of Romans 13, you missed, but many do. https://youtu.be/mLTj1vdonds that right there is someone much smarter than me discussing that part at length, and, by the way, this man received massive fines for continuing to run his church, and the courts have sided with him. The First Amendment exists. </p>
<p>The text you copied and pasted about corporate worship in Hebrews 10 does not apply to all denominations, and even the claim I made was specifically worded to show that there was a strong difference of opinions between denominations, and that various denominations view the issue differently. You also misunderstood the point of the humble service to one another, which would encourage you not to lay judgment on how you think others measure up to your standards, which still is completely NOT about the topic of corporate worship. </p>
<p>And it isn't virtue signaling to tell you that I'll pray for you to gain... Would you consider it virtue signaling to wish someone luck?  But I guess you know that we're also commanded to pray without ceasing, and that other part about iron sharpening iron.</p>

<p>Right. It exists. In two labs. No cases in US since 1949 and no cases anywhere since 1980. I think that might be why we don't vaccinate for it anymore. Counter example epic fail.</p>

<p>OK, it's either the word of god or up to the opinion of the denomination. Pick a lane. So does yours say "And the lord sayeth go out unto the world be a twat to thy fellow man" or was that a personal choice?</p>

<p>&rt;Would you consider it virtue signaling to wish someone luck? </p>
<p>No, because that would be offering support for another's success. Saying you will pray is an attempt to say your actions will help me. It costs  you nothing and allows you to pretend to be a virtuous person. I mean, I don't actually expect you to understand how your particular brand of hypocrisy works. I just thought I'd try to help.</p>

        <p>You sure do use a lot of false dichotomy... But here we go again..... If smallpox only exists in 2 labs, maybe you should ask other countries to stop vaccinations for it, or ask the military to stop giving it to people going to specific places, or notice I said it isn't given to mass quantities of Americans, not that we don't give it at all. Counter example gotcha fail...</p>
<p>Never said we don't pray in church, but you keep trying to conflate it with corporate worship, which is what I was talking about... I'll remind you, it's pray without ceasing, which of course means it will happen in church too, but I think you still don't know what corporate worship is, so, I'll point out for you that it is one of the things that was specifically prohibited when they were saying people couldn't even sing with a mask, while simultaneously allowing screaming at protests without a mask.... The limitations were, back on topic, very specifically targeted at limiting religious gatherings, not at obvious examples of public gatherings...</p>
<p>Nice ad hominem, but, if you really want to ask, because again you aren't familiar with the religion you keep attacking, yes actually, there are a few spots where it says to go out into the world and talk to people, and examples of our teacher specifically loving people who mocked him for it. You also aren't going to get far with trying to insult us for differences between denominations, cause those small interpretive differences aren't about key tenants of the faith, else they wouldn't be denominations, they'd be different religions. Ever wonder why it's basically treated as Protestant and Catholic instead of mentioning (usually) which of the various denominations of either of those it might be?  And I'll invite you to check out the various schisms that have formed over various details like the mudites and the anti-midites. Still doesn't change the central core of the faith, which I'm sure you've seen referenced at John 3:16.</p>

        <p>I'm not American so I'm not familiar with the US Constitution in detail.</p>
<p>That said, of course the principle of promoting general welfare is acceptable. I think we generally accept that the government has a role in the macro level promotion of general welfare, i.e. bin collection, safety standards for building construction, gritting of streets in cold weather, physical education during school, workers rights to limit working hours.  </p>
<p>What I and others here don't accept are these approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government restricting many fundamental individual freedoms in the name of fighting a public health crisis. This is, of course, very abusable.</li>
<li>The government using the law to mandate public health precautions and using the police to enforce these measures. Taking precautions against any particular risk is that individuals choice.<br>
Governments and independent health bodies should aim to inform individuals about the health choices that they can make then leave them to make a choice without threat of jail or fines from the state.</li>
<li>Putting out propaganda and policies that encourage people to view every other healthy citizen, first and foremost, as a disease vector.</li>

        <p>What fundamental freedom is being restricted? The right to spread disease? </p>
<p>The law has always mandated public health precautions. This is why you can't go to school without the MMR vaccine and why cooks cant cook when infected with typhoid. Your choice to not vaccinate risks the health of others and your rights end at your nose.</p>

        <p>&rt;What fundamental freedom is being restricted?</p>
<p>Many freedoms have suspended here in the UK:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to protest. <em>(At the beginning of the lockdown protest was cracked down on brutally so it wasn't even legal to protest the lockdown itself)</em></li>
<li>The right to free movement <em>(within ones own country and abroad)</em></li>
<li>The right to work/run a business <em>(gyms, restaurants, hotels were all closed)</em></li>
<li>The right to an education (<em>schools all closed for most of the last year)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And many more. And if you were to say, as some do, "show me where those freedoms were written down. Those aren't rights" then I would argue that's a very reductive view of freedom that favours the tyrant.</p>
<p>There are many more restrictions on things we are/were not permitted to do such as hug a family member; An activity that I couldn't place exactly which fundamental freedom has been eroded but I know that a line has been crossed.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&rt;The right to spread disease?</p>
<p>Exactly the mindset I was warning against. I do not have a disease. I am healthy and there are no signs to show otherwise. The concept of asymptomatic spread ("act like you have it") is a premise that is incompatible with human society as we've seen across the past 16 months. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrAvjU2LBkg&amp;t=32s">Fauci himself has said many times that asymptomatic transmission is not the driver of outbreaks</a>. <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article">Studies have supported this conclusion</a> - so why do we still hold on this vastly damaging idea? </p>
<p>Please give this serious consideration. The entire premise of social distancing hinges on the idea that a) Covid is significantly more dangerous than other diseases and b) asymptomatic transmission is a major disease vector.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>&rt;Your choice to not vaccinate risks the health of others and your rights end at your nose</p>
<p>Interesting that you assume that I'm not vaccinated. I hadn't expressed a view either way.</p>
<p>Both groups, the people who believe the vaccine risks outweigh its advantages for their age group and the ones who believe the vaccine advantages outweight its risks should all be concerned about the precedent this Covid affair has set for the government dictating what is best for the health of every individual.</p>

        <p>First, let's get this right. Covid is significantly more dangerous than most easily spreadable diseases. Take a look at India and the piles of burning bodies. Let's not go down the crazy hole here. How many other easily spreadable diseases killed 3.7 million people in a little over a year?<br>
Second, while asymptomatic spread is not the primary driver, it is ludicrous to pretend it is not a significant one. Want to know the real numbers? 30% of all cases were spread to someone before the initial onset of symptoms. Or to put it another way, you are arguing that asymptomatic spread isn't a real problem since only 30% or 1,110,000 people died due to infection from a person with no symptoms.  How many have mask mandates killed? How many has social distancing killed? How many has the vaccine killed? </p>
<p>"Interesting that you assume that I'm not vaccinated."</p>
<p>Well? Are you? I mean, let's be honest. People with your views are generally not on the right side of the curve.</p>
<p>BTW, the government has never dictated what is best for the health of the individual. That idea is just tin foil/black helicopter talk. The government has dictated what is best for the health of the nation. You know, things like people with typhoid should not be allowed to serve food to the public. The individual is not a consideration. </p>
<p>Sorry snowflakes, your feelings don't matter. By being an anti-science, anti-common sense group, the right and folk like you are harming the nation and your actions apparently need some sort of govt intervention to keep the rest of us safe. We know this because that group refuses to do the right thing all in the name of your "freedom" while their neighbors die from something we could have stopped already if it weren't for regressive backwards ant-intellectualism.</p>

<p>Yes - Covid is signficantly more dangerous than other diseases (approx 3-4x more deaths from Covid in the UK this year than Flu in 2019 (ONS data)). With that in mind, the  estimate of UK IFR ranged from 0.15%-0.30% and had previous been estimated in official figures at 0.5-1% (with all age-groups under 50 sitting at less than 0.1% chance of death).<br>
Now I appreciate that the virus is deadly and that 0.15%-0.30% of all the population is a large number. That said, lets keep it in perspective - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox">Smallpox killed 30%</a> .</p>
<p>In the case of covid, there are also now vaccines available to most people which further decreases their chance of severe symptoms by approx 70-90%.</p>

<p>Source for 30% asymptomatic transmission? The CDC study I linked had it at 13%.<br>
13%, in my view, is not nothing but when case prevelance in the UK is 0.5% so 99.5% of people are adhering to social distancing measures, masks, lockdown despite being healthy - the measures appear to be disproportionate.</p>
<p>With this particular point, the media have gone very hard on instilling that every person is a threat. So I don't blame you if you believed it but do look again at this.</p>

<p>Got it. In this authoritarian ideology, the individual is not a consideration. Yeah I'd already worked that one out. I just object to that being an ethical basis for policy.</p>
<p>Difference is with people with Typhoid (or any other disease really) we don't presume that they have it to begin with. Once they display symptoms and then are subsequently tested, then they are considered a risk and take precautions.</p>

<p>I know, they know, we all know. You think your individual concerns should be paramount over the overall needs of your nation and it's people. Selfishness is common today. No one is surprised by your position, only saddened by the lack of moral fortitude being displayed by the right.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;In this authoritarian ideology, the individual is not a consideration. </p>
<p>No, and it never has been. Laws aren't made for individuals. They never have been. What do you want? Are you asking for a way to provide healthcare that everyone, even the nutjobs are happy with? That's just fantasy. There will always be people who aren't happy with how things are done. As adults we accept that fact and try to do what is best for the nation. We don't try to make everyone happy. We compromise and we do it understanding that for some people there never will be a compromise. That's their choice and their problem. Those people don't get to dictate what the rest of us do. Democracy is rule by the people not rule by the persons.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;with people with Typhoid (or any other disease really) we don't presume that they have it to begin with. Once they display symptoms and then are subsequently tested, then they are considered a risk and take precautions.</p>
<p>Well that's just plain wrong. Did you know they "force" vaccines as well as TB and MSRA tests on everyone who works at a hospital? They are presumed infected and can't work until they satisfy these requirements. We do the same with every citizen who attends our public schools. You can't go until you get your shots. We presume you can infect your classmates without your vaccinations. When you join the Army, they shave your head because the default assumption is that you are carrying parasites. Your scenario is uninformed and entirely imaginary.</p>
<p>In fact, everything you said is a 'head movie' based on nothing but your own thoughts. Your argument is that the government is dictating individual health and taking away your rights, which demonstrably is not true. Temporary measures designed to protect the nation is not having your rights stripped. Pretending that's the case is pretty weak sauce. You are fine. You have electricity and internet access.

        <p>&rt;Laws aren't made for individuals. They never have been. </p>
<p>This is completely irrelevant? Of course laws are applied to all people and cannot possibly please all people.  </p>
<p>&rt;Did you know they "force" vaccines as well as TB and MSRA tests on everyone who works at a hospital?</p>
<p>Interesting. You do know that i'm all for vaccines and testing where it is proportionate and when it's targeted at those who are at real risk, right? Taking measures to prevent infection of hospital staff and visitors from diseases that are commonly found in hospitals is fine. Declaring that literally everyone above the age of 12 needs to get a covid vaccine despite the risk of death from the vaccine being greater than the risk of death from covid is a separate issue.  </p>
<p>&rt; Your argument is that the government is dictating individual health and taking away your rights, which demonstrably is not true. </p>
<p>Demonstrably not true? So a public health policy dictated by government, determining what risks an individual is permitted to take,  was in place for most of last year in the UK and that certainly restricts all of the freedoms i bullet pointed afew posts ago is going to be difficult to prove???  </p>
<p>&rt;You've moved a long way from your original argument and have just been arguing  points rather than sticking to your base argument. I think I know why.</p>
<p>I've had to address many of your tangential points. If it makes you feel better then sure, but I'll re-iterate my primary point:</p>
<p>The government's lockdown policy has damaged freedoms over the last year as it sought to limit the risk that any individual was permitted to take. Imposing limits on such fundamental areas of life is out of the government's remit but a precedent has now been set that the government must intervene with your health supposedly for the health of all.  We must return to the much less abusable notion that each individual is responsible for their own health.</p>

<p>We must return to nothing. Your opinion about individual responsibility for healthcare being some lofty goal amounts to you saying your opinion is more important than the rest of us.

        <p>No business was forced to close by the government. You can keep your business running. But you had to do so in a manner that is safe. Businesses that closed, did so because those rules were not compatible with their business model. They could not find a way to operate under the current rules. Others were able to. That's capitalism at it's finest.</p>
<p>But that last part. OMG I laughed. No one died because of the rules we put in place or the idea of public healthcare. They died from a disease which spread like wildfire because some people can't be bothered to do the right thing.</p>

        <p>That's certainly one interpretation. Happily, the system was designed so that we the people get to decide what the clause can do. We can elect leaders who want to provide healthcare for everyone instead of just the people with the means to do so. And indeed we have. <br>
Honestly, I have no idea why there is such a pushback on universal healthcare. According to the right wing Koch brothers, left wing research, and middle of the road policy institutes,  it will save us about half a billion a year. It's the fiscally conservative thing to do. Also, in addition to the immediate cost savings, you'll have a healthier citizenry meaning a stronger American economy. <br>
What do you think the downside of universal healthcare might be?</p>

I rationed healthcare? OK, you are off the rails bud. Yes, providing healthcare to everyone results in healthier people just like adding 1+1=2. No rationing. Healthcare isn't a hard commodity.

        <p>You asked what I had against national healthcare, so I told you. Nationalizing healthcare always results in lower quality and rationing. When this point is raised, there are plenty of people who make the case that doctors wouldn't be allowed to switch profession... That's compulsory labor... Call it what you want, but if they have to do a certain job and don't get any choice, I know what I call it.... But sure, I'm a bad person cause I don't think people should be forced to do some certain job they don't want cause they won't be paid properly? But sure, you want to cap costs, but you want to expand capacity, so where you gonna get all those new doctors? How you going to get quality doctors in greater numbers than you currently have while also saying you're gonna pay them less? You haven't even thought through the actual implications of the things you propose.</p>

        <p>&rt;cap costs by paying doctors less ... it's a cornerstone of every plan to lower costs of nationalized healthcare</p>
<p>citation needed for that. </p>
<p>As someone who has working in medical billing, I can tell you that the doctors pay is a tiny fraction of the bill. The lions share is what the hospital charges. Fun fact, they never intend to get what's on the bill. Insurers receive HUGE contractual discounts and generally pay 20-30% of the billed amount. They are fine with that too. All of this is agreed during contract negotiations before the first patient comes through the door. Yup, hospitals and doctors overcharge to the tune of 70-80% beyond costs and healthy profit margins. On the other hand, if you don't have insurance, they expect you to pay the full amount. Only fat cat insurance companies get the discount. Your argument betrays a lack of understanding on how any of this works.</p>
<p>Get rid of the insurers and the cost drops immediately. No need for the doctors pay to be effected at all. If your country has a failing national healthcare system, you simply did it wrong.</p>
<p>I used Cuba as my example because that poor tiny nation has longer life expectancy than the U.S.  Now, for a real showstopper, the highest ranked healthcare system in the world is Taiwan. They got rid of the insurers and the government acts as the insurer. It is characterized by good accessibility, comprehensive population coverage, short waiting times, low cost, and national data collection systems for planning and researc</p>
<p>Or you know, keep the broken expensive system we have now because somehow it's authoritarian or some such to take care of people while saving trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>You probably want to avoid argument like "doctor shortage/pay" by the way. It's kinda an uninformed place to make a stand. If you are worried about the pay doctors receive, vote for someone who will make sure they keep the higher pay rates. We don't have to cut and paste another nations system after all. We can do whatever we want. We can even elect leaders who want to make things better instead of the ones who think everything is just fine the way they are.</p>

        <p>Latest date I could find quickly from a Wikipedia page praising cuban healthcare said " Cuba has one of the highest life expectancy rates in the region, with the average citizen living to 78.05 years old in 2009 (in comparison to the United States' 78.62 years in 2009)" so, no, cuban life expectancy is not longer. Also found another page saying " The homicide rate in the US is much higher than in other rich countries. As most homicide victims are young, this contributes to the lower level of life expectancy in the US in comparison with other rich countries.Oct 29, 2020". So.... </p>
<p>How bout instead of nationalized healthcare, we go for total transparency in costs like fast food places, so people can do comparison shopping? Let the organizations fight the price war instead of all the shadow deals and post care billing...</p>

        <p>you haven't said anything that requires addressing. You said every nationalized healthcare plan includes a reduction in pay for doctors. You made the claim, I asked for proof, and you can't provide any. What's to address? Do I need to address false and unproven claims made by you? Nope.</p>

        <p>Yep, pile in the ad hominem instead of acknowledging that in the history of ever, nothing socialized has ever need more efficient or cheaper. You probably also believe in the myth of modern monetary theory, which if you actually believed, taxes would become completely unnecessary because it declares all money imaginary anyway. Socialism has never worked. This is the part where you tell me it's never been real socialism. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Right here in the U.S. it works or do you not use roads, police, fire dept, etc etc? Your grammar school definition of what socialism means is pathetically reductive and shows that you have no business having discussions with adults.<br>
Or to put it another way, when I slap the shit out of you, are you going to call a private police force to come rescue your confused ass?</p>

        <p>I know our social programs don't fit your grade school definition of socialism. That's doesn't change the fact the the people have directed funds and resources to social works for the benefit of the people i.e. the people controlling the means of production. In this case the means are taxes and the production is the implementation of our social programs. I'm sure this all goes way over your head so I will understand even when you can't</p>
<p>You have this imaginary "socialism bad" boogey man that you want to fight against but the problem is that the kind of socialism you are talking about isn't what us educated adults are going for. Socialism is a spectrum of ideas and policies that do not fit your single definition of what you think socialism is. </p>
<p>All you are really accomplishing is to inflate your ego by imagining you are taking a stand. The problem is that your are taking a stand against something that isn't happening. You're like the dog who barks at the trash truck because he imagines it is coming to hurt him and when the trucks continues down the road is all proud that he chased the bad thing away. All the while, the dumb but well intentioned little dog is completely unaware of what was actually happening.</p>
<p>No one is going to take you seriously unless they share the same poor education and child like understanding of the world around them. The rest of the world will not wait for you to wake up. We don't expect you to ever understand how to operate in your own best interest and the best interest of society at large. You are a sad footnote to a history of progression towards a better life for us all. You're type will be nothing more than a cautionary tale on the importance of a well educated and informed populace that any democracy needs to thrive as well as an example of how easily people can be fooled in to believing in false narratives and conspiratorial thought.</p>

        <p>Kindergarten understanding of the implications of full socialism designed to dupe rubes u to believing it ever works. The only thing socialism ever managed to spread evenly is misery, and it even does a poor job if that since the inner circle (but don't dare call them a ruling class) always live in comfort while the peasants are forced into socialized slavery.</p>

        <p>It is not the law, it's merely the document that frames what our laws should be, who has the power to enact them, and what limits are placed upon that power. <br>
Therefore, creating laws to uphold the fundamental principles upon which this nation is founded, in this case it's providing for the general welfare, is well within the powers and duties of our elected officials.<br>
Finally, our current healthcare it tied to employment. We are all seeing how bad that idea really is. Maybe it's time we acted like a great nation and begin the process of protecting everyone from accident, illness, and disease while saving trillions of dollars.</p>

        <p>If you go to the store knowing well you don‚Äôt have covid, you can easily just get it at the store and spread it without knowing at all. Are you really gonna get tested knowing you‚Äôre 100% negative before you go out each time?</p>

        <p>Based. Well said mate. Your freedom ends where it impedes the freedoms of others. You can't go around infecting others with a disease. That's not a right you have. We don't allow the "personal choice" to go around murdering or assaulting other citizens and we don't allow the "personal choice" to go around infecting other citizens with diseases. It's pretty fuckin simple if you aren't a selfish braindead halfwit who thinks wearing a mask is the holocaust because you haven't actually experienced anything approaching actual oppression in your life.</p>

        <p>Herpes is not airborne genius. Try again. It's also a crime to knowingly infect others with herpes. What the fuck is this psychotic conspiracy mongering? Even within the false equivalency you set up between herpes and covid, it still fails. You aren't allowed to infect people with herpes. That is a crime. This strain of covid has only existed in humans for a year and a half. I'm talking about the current pandemic not any other disease right now. During the pneumonic plague people wore face coverings too.</p>
<p>Also, what excuses? The fuck is this nonsense? You have no idea what you're talking about. Being in favor of the freedom to not be infected with diseases is not "making excuses". You're on the side that says you should be allowed to infect others with disease. I disagree with you. I value the freedom to not be infected more than your freedom to infect others. Don't like it? Go to the Congo, I'm sure they have looser covid restrictions. If you want to live in our society you have to play by its rules.</p>

        <p>The problem with that is when one person's  lifestyle choices remove the ability of others to live as they choose. For example, let's say one neighbour decides they love the smell of burning rubber and decides to burn tires each weekend in their yard. It's their yard, their tires, their lungs breathing the fumes, it's their choice too? Even if it means the whole neighborhood is covered in smoke? What about the neighbours who would rather live in clean air? What about those with asthma? In their own home they should have the right to breathe clean air right? What happens next? Do the clean air enthusiast's have to just sell their land and move? Who will buy land knowing that one if the neighbours lifestyle choices means that they will be breathing smoke? What's to stop Timmy Tireburns from selling his land and moving to their new suburb?</p>

<p>The entire point of the original comment is that because it would be wrong for someone to do what they described in the example, which is reflected by its illegality, any similar act (which shares the common thread of someone exercising their freedoms at the cost of others‚Äô freedom or well-being) should also be illegal, or at the very least considered wrong.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure he doesn't mean "burning tires" in a literal way. An analogy would be fast food industries needing farms with huge livestock for their foods, subsequently messing up green space and rivers for other people to use. Sure, people with unhealthy life choices don't mind that if that means they can get what they want, but people living in those areas are worse off even though they didn't contribute to this problem.</p>

<p>There are already Hundreds, if not Thousands of laws around the raising of livestock. </p>
<p>YOU are the one making a blanket statement as if we are currently operating in some sort of lawless wasteland, while attempting to petition your superiors in government to write More Laws, when you‚Äôve no idea how many Already Exist. </p>

        <p>What the - no!? I brought up the point that it's hard to find rules and laws for raising farm animals in a sustainable and eco-friendly manner. What you're touching on is that we as humans are really good at destroying diversity and upping the chances for plagues to spread by only raising few kinds of kettle. Did I get that wrong?</p>

        <p>I think you are mixing a few different issues together there. I think medicinal antibiotics should only be given to an animal when it's sick, and it shouldn't be in the food supply if it's sick, so yeah, don't eat it till it's healthy again... But also, we shouldn't need to spray so much stuff on plants if we revert to STUN methods of growing foods, be they plant or animal.</p>

        <p>&rt; There are already thousands of laws designed to answer every question you just posed.</p>
<p>So these laws are good then.</p>
<p>Lets take a similar situation, say a global pandemic? The core issue is that similar to the tire burning situation, your bad habits might end with a neighbor dying. Should we have laws to prevent that?</p>
<p>That's the difference between the post above and covid. If you want to inhale Big Macs, fine, since you are ultimately the one making the choice to do that and you have the freedom of choice to do as you please with your life, even if it harms you.

        <p>Okay for those who can't read between the lines I'll explain. Timmy the tire burner is the unmasked, unvaccinated person. His actions wether they be burning if tires or spreading disease would be fine choices if they affect him alone. But they don't other people breath in the gasses he breaths out. They get sick. Some of them die. Some can't work and go into debt. Timmy's personal lifestyle choices have consequences on the community. </p>
<p>As you so helpfully pointed out, there are laws against that kind of thing. Legal precedent for restricting personal choice for the good of the community. If I burn tires in VT it's a crime. If I expose my community to covid. . . This isn't some wishy washy, maybe it will help maybe it won't kind of thing. It works. Countries that took covid seriously controlled the outbreak and are back to normal. Restrictions are gone.</p>

        <p>Fantastic job reading there buddy. If you were also reading the ever increasing research papers on the topic you would see that yes, masks are not 100% effective. However, even single layer disposable masks reduce droplet count and size, as well as aerosol dispersal. Thus even the simplest of masks offer some level of protection from covid. </p>
<p>As stated, masks do not provide 100% protection. A manufacturer may include a product disclaimer like that to prevent litigation.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what your point was here. You won't wear a simple, comfortable, cheap ear loop mask. Can you honestly say you would wear a full respirator if that was required to meet mask standards?</p>

        <p>Cool, looks like the manufacturer has the wrong info mate. Maybe get in contact with them about it. Unless you trust the marketing team of a facemask company more than you do the scientific consensus? which at that point you are just beyond helping. I actually live in part of the world where people took the whole thing seriously mate. Mask mandates, travel restrictions, shutdowns, the whole lot. The benefit of a few boring weeks is no covid. I haven't worn a face mask in 6 months. There are no active cases within a few hundred km. There are no active restrictions. Hasn't been for months. I don't know a single person who died of covid. I don't know a single person who was hospitalised. I can count on one had the people I know who tested positive. My life is back to normal. Check back in with me when you can say the same</p>

        <p>Hey, non anti masker here, just visiting this sub and replied to the guy your replying to:</p>
<p>&rt;For those who don't understand the point of masks:</p>
<p>&rt;<em>It stops the virus from going from your mouth to another person</em> </p>
<p>&rt;The mask does not provide protection when a very misinformed person like you coughs on someone who is wearing a mask. The only thing that prevents that is a full body protective suit. </p>
<p>&rt;Get a fucking brain dumbass, transmission is one way.</p>
<p>Masks dont do shit when someone who isn't wearing a mask (like the idiot who doesn't understand what the box is saying) coughs on you, the virus can enter through your eyes, or is on your skin now.</p>
<p>The mask prevents someone who is infected from coughing up the virus on others. </p>
<p>What the box is saying is true because it doesn't do shit when someone coughs up their crap onto you. </p>
<p>Basically someone not wearing a mask has the same chance at getting the virus as you, but is also going to spread the virus.</p>

        <p>True but the same argument actually can be found on the pro choice side too. In a simplified, written whole falling asleep version: each person has a right to their own body. I can use my body as I see fit. If I choose, I can donate blood, or a kidney, or even donate the whole thing when I'm dead. But as long as I live, nobody can force me to do it. A single donation of blood might save multiple people's lives, at little to no risk or damage to myself. Despite the shortage of blood donors, nobody is allowed to run up and stick a needle and draw lifesaving blood from me without consent. Even if I have donated blood before, every month for ages, there is no requirement I donate blood today, or next month or the month after that. Every day we walk around with redundant organs. Organs others need to live. Have you donated your second kidney yet? Your lung? A hunk of liver? Maybe? Probably not. Despite people dying for lack of these organs we don't just take them from the living. We don't even take them from the dead, those who will never even notice their absence. Even in death the bodies autonomy is respected. </p>
<p>If we cannot demand others to sacrifice their organs or even give blood to save a life, how dare we make that demand of someone seeking abortion. Why is bodily autonomy something so precious we follow it to the grave suspended during pregnancy? Why does a pregnant person have less control than a corpse? "You carried it for 6 weeks already, you had sex, you asked for it" they might say. I donated blood for 6 years and I asked for that too. But I stopped. Depending on the donation size and who needs it, one donation can save up to 5 people, but when I stopped donating blood people don't act like I was killing 3 people a month. They didn't insist I keep going, just for 8 more months. They didn't outlaw me keeping my blood in my veins. My bodily autonomy was more important than the lives I might save. Why would abortion be different?</p>
<p>This is not the place for this discussion. But here the fetus is the burner, requiring others to put up with the burdens his individual needs and wants have put on those around him. He violates their right to clean air, to health, to comfort even within their own space, their own property, their own lungs. His rights end at his property, his neighbours have no obligation to put up with it on their own.</p>

        <p>Using your logic with regards to harvesting of body parts/blood, my right to bodily autonomy means that my choice to refuse a shot or mask should come before the lives I might save by being required to use those methods.</p>
<p>And I would agree - you are right. Nobody has a right to safety, health, or life. They are not guaranteeable in a mortal existence. </p>
<p>Nobody has a right to tell anyone that existing in their natural state and having complete dominion over their body is a crime, and they definitely do not have the right to force/coerce them into sacrificing themselves to appease others.</p>

        <p>Yes, mostly. nobody can force you to wear the mask, donate organs or stay pregnant. They do not have that right. They don't have the right to your health, your life, or your safety. They do however have a right to their own. Your insistence on following your personal lifestyle choices does not allow you to infringe on their health, life or safety. They have the right to refuse your entry into their space. They have the right to refuse you service. </p>
<p>You have a right to freedom. This does not superceded their rights. If you choose to abstain from covid safe practices, they have a right to exclude you. If you practice safe practices, things change. If you drink, you are excluded from the people who can drive. When you sober up, you are welcome to drive once more.</p>

        <p>Mate there are so many ways people can hurt each other. You can hit them with a car, stab them with a knife or shoot them with a gun. I'm glad that there are laws to discourage people from doing that. People should be free to do as they wish, so long as they don't cause harm to others. It's really not that hard to understand. </p>
<p>Its interesting that you recognise the risk of DUI, a selfish choice that risks the individual and the people around them, when so many people here are adamant that they should be allowed to keep risking the health of others by selfishly not taking covid precautions. </p>
<p>Really though it seems like instead of attempting to understand an opposing view, or debating its merits you would rather look for cheap "gotchas". </p>
<p>Life is fragile. Knowing a simple mistake like a DUI could destroy it for me or others I do my best to live conscientiously to protect myself and those around me. I have chosen not to drink and drive. I cannot control the actions of others, but I can hold myself accountable and that brings me peace. What about you? How does the constant risk of danger affect how you act and perceive the world?</p>

        <p>I absolutely do not believe in forcing masks and lockdowns even a little. But I also don't believe banning anything else is desirable whatsoever. The whole point is freedom of choice. The other side wouldn't be better for banning cigarettes and alcohol. It's practically the same thing the lockdown and mask people are doing.</p>

        <p>I get the point BUT... all authoritarianism is evil. The idea of forcing people "for their own good" is how we got into this mess.</p>
<p>The proper function of government is to protect your rights. That can never extend to protecting you from yourself.  The government does not own you. You own you. Thus, government does not and cannot know what's "good for you" better than you do.</p>

<p>From reading this sub, I get that you all don‚Äôt believe it is a matter of your safety, that the threat does not rise to that level. That there is the disagreement, not a disagreement over the concept of government being there to protect your rights.</p>

        <p>&rt; you all don‚Äôt believe it is a matter of your safety</p>
<p>Yes, you are correct. Neither the constitution, Bill of Rights nor other writings by the founders including the Federalist Papers ever entertained the concept of the government being responsible for a citizen's safety - especially from their own decisions. Some people are confused by the police protecting the constitutional right to be "secure in person and property" however this is not at all the same as "it's the government's job to keep me safe."  </p>
<p>I get that it can be confusing if you haven't thought the distinction through (I blame this on declining civic education in recent decades). Once you do think it through it should become clear that the idea of government being responsible for a citizen's safety is unworkable both practically and morally. Different people make different choices about acceptable risk and this varies widely based on individual context. Carried to its extreme, it's literally impossible for the government to prevent a free adult from doing stupid stuff to themselves. This is why NYC taxing soft drinks "for your own good" is ridiculous (and doesn't even work, studies show people just substitute other junk food).</p>
<p>This paternalistic assumption that the government knows best and will fix all wrongs was never built into our system. The government is not your mommy and to the extent it tries to be, you may have noticed it does a shitty job. If you think the government is going to keep you safe from bad things happening to you, you're going to have a bad time. YOU bear the burden of sustaining your safety to the level you desire. Both the powers AND the responsibilities of government are extremely limited in the U.S. - by design. Everything else is on you.  </p>
<p>There are some people now saying they will be wearing a mask everywhere for the next five years. Great! They should be free to do that. However, just as that person's "right to swing their arm, stops short of my nose", their interpretation of "safe" stops short of my right to live my life.</p>

        <p>I agree with all that, when it's decisions that only harm yourself. This is not about "paternalistic" assumption or "declining civic education".</p>
<p>As we agreed, it's a disagreement whether the contagion is a level at which it affects public safety,  It's NOT about protecting individuals from themselves, it's about protecting them from harming others. I get that can be confusing, because you don't believe the threat is that intense.</p>
<p>IF, indeed you could infect others without knowing, and IF they could die from it, and IF masks worked, wouldn't it be incumbent on the government to intervene and create laws to prevent you from harming others, especially in public? It's a lot of ifs, but that's what we're talking about, and not about the government's right to make laws where warranted.</p>

        <p>I understand your argument. In that hypothetical situation, it is possible for government to have a legitimate interest in public safety that rises to a fairly significant level of invasiveness for a limited time period - BUT:</p>
<ul>
<li>The grave existential risk AND the effective remedy have to be proven beyond doubt - not merely precautionary assumptions.</li>
<li>Even then, the infringement of rights must be as minimal, limited and brief as possible.</li>
<li>There must be a careful assessment of the "balance of harms"</li>
<li>Significant infringements cannot be sustained by one branch of the government. Ongoing infringements must be expressly ratified by the legislative and judicial branches and ultimately by voters.</li>
<li>Even if all those standards are met (and none were in this case), there are <em>still</em> limits on suspending civil rights, even if it spares the lives of a lot of people. No matter what the circumstances, the government is not just free to do whatever it thinks is the best for the most people. The framers of the constitution were explicitly opposed to the idea of "the ends justify the means."</li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, in theory it's possible. But our system of governance was wisely designed to make doing such stuff extremely difficult - even at the risk of government not being powerful enough. Yet the past year has seen hysterical fear intentionally fueled to permit the worst abuses we've <em>ever</em> seen as a nation.  I'm a calmly sober person. I don't get ruffled by much of anything. What's been allowed to happen over the past year worries me deeply. I think it should worry any thinking person who values the unique, unprecedented success of the grand "American Experiment" started 250 years ago.</p>

        <p>Thanks. You might find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/ntao0x/lawsuits_mushroom_as_workers_test_employers_right/h0u5bwy/?context=3">this thread I wrote yesterday</a> with legal analysis useful. Especially the second post where I discuss the huge differences between smallpox vaccinations being required to attend public elementary school and requiring CV19 vax in healthy adults or kids. I'm not an anti-vaxxer at all. I think the courts have gotten the smallpox vax just about right. The mandated requirements are appropriately scaled to the proven risks and include a way to opt out if you don't want to comply (the Amish don't vax their kids by running their own schools).</p>
<p>Despite the fact I strongly encourage everyone to vaccinate their kids for smallpox, I don't think I (or anyone) should have the power to force it through violence. If you asked my opinion about whether to vax your kid for smallpox, I'd argue (and have argued) that avoiding making a call between two risks by doing nothing purely out of fear and ignorance is dereliction of parental responsibility. I'd try my best to convince you to do the right thing for your kid. However, I wouldn't criminalize the Amish, who do the hard work to successfully manage smallpox risk in other ways, just so we can send men with guns to jab the kid of a suburban parent panicked by reading QAnon conspiracy shit online.</p>

        <p>Now that we've moved past this particular case, which I'm glad for, as I like to talk hypotheticals -</p>
<p>Let's say we do agree on the exact amount of harm inflicted on others by various individual activities. Smallpox was a good one, but what about less harmful, but still health-reducing things people can do to other people, say, smoking in public? How do we decide whether and how that should be regulated, if we know inhalation of secondhand smoke from cigarettes doesn't immediately kill anyone? Hopefully this is a good example in your mind.  If not, choose another one that is close to that borderline for you ...</p>

        <p>That's less conspiracy and more the free market. I make more money if I use high fructose core syrup to make my products sweeter than my competition. Safer pesticides are more expensive (typically because they are more difficult to synthesise or still under patent), so I will use the cheaper, unhealthy ones to increase my profit margins.

        <p>When in America do as the Americans do and that is pull out a huge gun. The rest of the world is ruled by a new monarchy and they have open arms because they have also been servants. That is the difference between an American and the rest of the world. The reason they don't do this is out of fear their country will end in American rights washing over the elites that rule them.</p>

        <p>Masks were mostly about creating government control.</p>
<p>I'm much more suspicious about the vaccines than the masks. Mostly because the intent of masks (making us obedient sheeple) was pretty easy to figure out, but it's harder to figure out what the purpose of the vaccines is.</p>

        <p>so now that masks aren't mandatory any more, what was the purpose? why would the us do all this for a little control just for masks to come right back off as soon as the virus is dying down? i'm just curious. also what could possibly be the alterier motive for the vaccine? microchips to track us? no they can track our phones. poison? if they wanted us dead they could just bomb us no issue. microchips tracking our vitals? wtf is that helpful for?</p>

        <p>Base your logic in reality though for a minute, people aren't getting rid of their phones, at least not ANYtime soon. They are so integrated with society at this point that no amount of spying would discourage 99.99% of phone users. Because at the end of the day, what are they gonna gain from tracking us? They know i sat in my house all day, until i went to cvs around 3 then came back to my house? cool... what do they care? Remember when it came out that China was stealing a shit ton of data from tik tok users? None of its users gave a flying fuck, obviously tik tok is still kickin.</p>

        <p>I just want to understand, like I just can't seem to go through the mental gymnastics to get to these conclusions some of these people are coming to. For example, (extreme) I can understand why ww2 happened and why hitler did what he did, even though obviously i don't agree with it and think it was one of the worst atrocity's in history, but i can see the steps he took in his mind and understand what he gained from it all. But I can't for the life of me figure out why tf the US government would have any motivation to create an evil master plan. and if they did, why would it be this? Like the government is gonna have this super crazy world wide plan to control people that can be easily foiled by people just not wearing a mask. None of it makes any sense, it's just people wishing for excitement in a relatively boring world. All these movies and media got people wishing for some crazy ass global conspiracy shit, when in reality our government can hardly do the shit it's supposed to do. if they wanted us dead, they'd bomb us. if they wanted us tracked, they'll just track our phones. if they want us controlled and suppressed, then there would be tanks rolling down your street tomorrow and you couldn't do shit about it. what are you gonna do, combat the us military with your ar-15s and glocks? None of it makes any sense and i just want to get a GLIMPSE into the mind of someone who thinks this way to try and understand. But like i said me personally, i think these people are just bored.</p>

        <p>They throw rational thought out the window. They have no real reason why they believe these things. They only want to feel like they‚Äôre heroes fighting the big bad government. People like this don‚Äôt think about what is necessary to try to carry out a plan they think the government wanted.  </p>
<p>Same with people who say covid is a ploy to control people. So you have to agree that ALL countries decided to work together to pull this off. You have to believe many different things just for a single conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Like i said, mental fucking gymnastics. People need answers, and if they don't get them, they'll make them up. My favorite part is "they put something in the vaccine" yet they can't agree on what that would be, because what the fuck could the US gain from putting anything other than the vaccine into the vaccine? And if there was something (microchip, poison, miniature yoshi dye cast figure i don't fucking know) then why wouldn't they put them in the flu shots administered yearly? Ya didn't even have to do the whole covid mask control then vaccine yoshi figure plan, you could have just put it in the already create vaccines like god damn</p>

        <p>There are political ties and constant propaganda towards masks. There is an evident agenda in my eyes which I don‚Äôt agree with. It should just end here tbh.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have been lied to on the effectiveness of masks and COVID. It is hysterical, and being forced by someone I don‚Äôt even know (who doesn‚Äôt have my best interest) to wear masks, makes me not want to even more.</p>
<p>I actually like wearing clothes, I don‚Äôt like wearing masks and that should be my choice. I don‚Äôt recall being lied to, pressured and gaslighted into wearing clothes.</p>
<p>Evidently, this is not a fair comparison at all to make AT ALL.</p>

<p>So what do you people do when we start getting rid of masks? Admit you're wrong?</p>
<p>If it was all to "control" us, why would they get rid of masks?</p>

        <p>Because they attached "virtue" to wearing masks, and too many people are such vacuous drudges that they'll go for the easy "virtue".</p>
<p>Eating veggies regularly doesn't appeal easily enough to people's willingness to go along with it at the mere suggestion. Ie: the fruit isn't hanging low enough from the tree.</p>
<p>Closing businesses is immoral. One man's "non-essential" business, according to our benevolent leaders, may be "essential" for keeping his wife and children from starving and losing their home. Two wrongs do not make a right. The solution lies in pushing back <em>hard</em> in the opposite direction--harder than we were pushed in the first place.</p>
<p>Outlawing porn will cast a darker shadow for which the black market will thrive upon more. People like sex. People like watching others have sex. It's not going away. If anything, it's a ship that needs to be steered from the inside.</p>
<p>Alcohol and cigarettes are available because people are free to use them because people <em>should</em> be free. What it should <em>not</em> come with is social bailouts for their bad decisions. Ie: universal healthcare, etc.</p>

        <p>It makes me sad that when I see this stuff posted.  This sub is supposed to be about taking back our freedoms and having a choice to take the vaccine.  It should not be about pushing some agenda and beliefs, which is exactly what is going on right now with the masks and vaccines.</p>
<p>How is it acceptable for someone to say that the government should not force that (wearing masks), but instead force this (eating vegetables)?  Then say they should go ahead and shut down legal private businesses that do things we don't agree with (junk food and porn)?</p>
<p>If someone wants to eat a 5 pound candy bar, while smoking and taking shots of tequila, with 6 screens of porn playing in the back ground, then they should be free to do it.  It's pretty out there and has some obvious consequences, but it's their business (and responsibility) what they do with their bodies, not mine or the government's.</p>

You can check the statistics and you'll see how many young man get erectile disfunction and more than half the marriages deteriorating because of when at least one of the two is consuming it. If that wasn't enough secular data, it is morally wrong in Christianity. 
I was in a similar boat and I can tell you from experience you feel much happier after you quit because you are full of energy and have the time to invest in something worthwhile, plus you are no longer depressed and feeling low.</p>
<p>Edit: A more concise comment I was above was this:</p>
<p>Porn is very damaging, especially towards men. It is a silent killer / addiction and turns you into a dopamine loving zombie.</p>

        <p>I have said this before. For Big Healthcare/Big Pharma, there is no money to be made off of healthy people. COVID was only killing people who were old and sick. (Those are the people who spend money on healthcare). If they died, the healthcare industry loses all of their customers and loses money.</p>
<p>This is the same reason that no one is getting rid of junk food, alcohol, and tobacco. The healthcare industry would lose money if people actually started making health life choices.</p>

        <p>Because as Fauci‚Äôs emails are proving to us, the government is literally trying to kill all of us. Why else would the disastrous Biden administration be coercing us into taking their obviously incredibly dangerous ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù? They want us dead so that they can have everything to themselves, using the climate change hoax as an excuse for genocide.</p>

        <p>Valid points, although its worth pointing out that 100 years ago America DID ban alcohol. Although this did reduce overall alcohol consumption, it didn't really reduce the problem drinking and it increased the problem of organized crime. Banning cigarettes would probably work about as well as banning pot did, in other words, not at all. Also- cigarettes are made from vegetables (tobacco).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the government regularly uses regulations to close businesses, this abuse of power long pre-dated Covid.</p>
<p>Also, they made it harder to exercise by closing gyms during Covid.</p>

        <p>Junk food won't send you to the hospital. Smoking is a persal choice, Covid isn't. You don't choose whether or not you get it. If numbers reach above a certain threshold hospitals will become overwhelmed and people will die on the streets. This is not a hypothetical scenario it happened to developed and developing countries alike. It's easy to talk when you're not suffocating to death begging to breath.
And no, I'm not saying that the government is handling the situation Optimally.</p>

        <p>The point is that if the government is prepared to do extremely strict regulations (not just masks, though that's the common strawman - including business closures, house arrest, travel restrictions, etc), may as well take action which has a far better outcome.</p>
<p>Mandate exercise, nobody has any rights unless they have a 6 pack, etc.</p>

        <p>They do these things because of of the piles of evidence from previous pandemics that tell us they best way to minimise death, minimise impacts on the economy and minimise human suffering is to act. Do what you can to minimise transmission while finding a way to stop it completely. Have a look at what it took to end the smallpox. The end of the smallpox epidemics is actually a really interesting section of medical history. They did what they could to limit spreading and enacted travel restrictions for those who couldn't prove that they were safe. Since smallpox left distinctive marks on the body, and the vaccines of the time left scars of their own, many places used these marks as proof of a person immunization. An early vaccine passport if you will.</p>

        <p>It was super effective in New Zealand mate. There are examples from this every pandemic that show how effective it is. There are examples out there if you go looking. </p>
<p>The thing that makes this different from outlawing obesity is that obesity isn't contagious. No matter how fat you are, you being fat doesn't make me fat or sick. With contagious diseases things change. One person can be sick, but mostly fine, and the  spread it to people who won't be fine. They go to a wedding and expose the guest to the covid. Now what was for one person mild, flu like symptoms are a protracted, life-threatening hospital stay for  the elderly. Now the nurse can't go to work without risking exposing her patients who are immunocompromised. Now the nurses are short-staffed and the patients get worse care. The chef can't go to work while sick, if the whole kitchen gets sick they can't do business, but if he doesn't go to work he can't pay his bills. </p>
<p>With contagious diseases the actions of one affect many. We have laws against drinking and driving to stop the actions of one destroying the lives of others, how is this different?</p>

        <p>Yeah a big part of the problem is the first incorrect assumption of this shit post. They couldn't get the entire world to wear a mask, which is why we still have a global pandemic. Because morons said it was fake, a hoax, or like the flu. Not to mention I don't make you get sick by not eating my carrots. However I can get cancer from you smoking cigarettes near me, and guess what we did about that? We banned public smoking.</p>

<p>Aren't you guys the same people who claim that the flu was nearly wiped out this year because of people wearing masks?</p>
<p>So which one is it?</p>
<p>Also, your claims are unfalsifiable and therefore not scientific. You are basically saying "the restrictions work, and if they didn't work, that just means you didn't follow them hard enough!!!". That's not falsifiable and therefore not even worth <em>considering</em>. You're like those Christian fundamentalist nutjobs.</p>

        <p>The public smoking ban is a very good comparison. At the time the debate over public smoking was raging, there was no real data to prove secondhand smoke caused cancer. The anti-smoking side cherry picked and warped the data to make a disingenuous argument that it did. I remember one quote coming from the interviews very well, "when fascism comes to the United State it will be wearing a white coat." </p>
<p>Now I don't know if anything has changed on the second smoke front, but it's an interesting comparison.</p>

If you don‚Äôt like this source then you can go ahead and find dozens more saying the same thing. Or try to explain how Israel broadcasting porn to a city they are occupying with their military is just out of the goodness of their hearts because they want people to have a good time. Neither argument would surprise me from coomers like you. You‚Äôll fight tooth and nail to defend your own degeneracy, viewing women as objects to be consumed, and instant gratification, all under an industry with rampant abuse. You‚Äôre sick to defend it.<br>
