    <strong>Masks affecting how we perceive others</strong>
    <p><p>I think that people who are naturally quiet and who have subtle facial expressions may be more likely to be seen as unfriendly while wearing a mask. I went to my child's school office to pick something up. (The school is still shut down for students). One of the staff members had to walk across the campus to bring it to me. Maybe she was smiling at me under her mask. But of course I couldn't see that. I got the impression from looking at her eyes that she was annoyed with me. Then I decided I didn't like her. It's only two days later that I'm analyzing that interaction and realizing that it's entirely possible that I misread that whole interaction and thus my impression of that person. Once masks come off, we should give people a second chance at first impressions.</p></p>

        <p>I was taking my morning walk, and was approaching an elderly woman on the trail.  We smiled at each other and said "Good morning", but it occurred to me that if I'd been masked, I would have been a potentially scary figure, given that I was 2 feet taller and walking quite a bit faster than her.</p>

        <p>This is what really kills me. I love smiling at random people and giving them a nod. The only time I wear a mask is in a business because I will not harm the owners that are under the grips of fines and what not, plus, if the workers are worries. Whatever. But I hate shopping and not being able to make gestures to others through my face. Now as a fairly quite person it's a muffled something or other. </p>
<p>It is dehumanizing. It is separating us. It is control. There is a reason people think us Americans are weird is we are always talking and acknowledging others. Other countries especially Asian cultures that normally wear masks don't. Some European countries don't chat up random people. Americans are known for this, talking or acknowledging others. I love even the simple smile. </p>
<p>I miss the simple smile.</p>

        <p>Same here. It's actually wearing on my psyche that I can't see the person's face.</p>

        <p>I have always had a hard time projecting my voice, so I use facial expressions to help. Communication from a distance is basically impossible for me right now.</p>

        <p>Same thing has happened to me at the local library! They bring the books outside to us with a mask on! I wasn’t  wearing one so of course I’m smiling and saying thank you and I couldn’t tell but it felt the lady was annoyed with me. I’ve been ordering a lot of books for homeschooling and I laughed and said “homeschool” and she walked off, so if she smiled or anything I have no idea but it felt like an awkward almost sterile interaction.</p>

        <p>I'm agree. People expect us to stand 1-2 meters away from each others. We're not allowed physical contact or standing too close to each others, so how are we supposed to communicate then? Masks are hiding facial expressions. Not everyone are equally expressive in their voice and body language.</p>
<p>Masks makes it harder for everyone, but especially deaf, autistic and people with auditory processing disorder. Other having a hard time communicating are claustrophobic and anxious people. I went from normal hearing to not being able to understand what people are saying almost overnight thanks to the masks. I relies on facial expressions and a clear voice to understand what people are saying. If someone talks to me with a mask on, especially a commoner, I can't hear anything. It really upsets me when my teachers are wearing masks and I don't understand. They didn't put an effort into wearing one with a window on at least.</p>
