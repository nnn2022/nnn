        <p>Which in turn begs the question: From where were these 'cases' transmitted from? where is the hotspot? groundzero, etc..<br>
Nobody would order a country in to mass house-arrest bases upon 3 individual cases of a disease, so this indicates there is something else at cause. No New Normal.</p>

        <p>so if it is about tightening control why has there been no lockdown for almost a year, why didn't the government jump at the chance to lockdown when we had the "outbreak" we had a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>also, why and how are billionaires going to steal more than the entire GDP of NZ from the lower classes and bankrupt them because... people with no money are good for business?</p>

        <p>What I outlined above is the global strategy. I discuss the end-goals more <a href="https://overduerevolutions.wordpress.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-desiderata/">here</a>. The world is owned and operated by a small number of the old noble/banking/industrialist families (e.g. Rockefellers, Rothschilds, House of Stuart (old kings of England), Stanleys (Kings of Mann), etc.) Each actual country is owned by different groups, and so the implementation varies. It gives the illusion of national sovereignty. The Ardern family in New Zealand comes from the English Peerage, and I quote from <em>The Noble and Gentle Men of England; Their Arms and Descent</em>: </p>
<p>"No family can claim a more noble origin that the house of Ardern, descended in the male line from the Saxon Earls of Warwick before the Conquest. The name of Arden was assumed from the Woodlands of Arden, in the North of Warwickshire, by Siward de Arden, in the reign of Henry I."</p>
<p>We can see other Arderns from NZ related to <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Queenie-Ardern/6000000037765802957">barons</a>. You might say that this doesn't link to Jacinda specifically, but all famous people and politicians hide their roots carefully, and it would take more work for me to uncover extensive connections than I am willing to do right now.</p>
<p>In the case of New Zealand, the repeated lockdowns acclimatizes citizens to sudden and arbitrary restrictions on their freedoms, with no guaranteed end date. New Zealand's "success" can also be used to push the lockdown narrative to the global audience, despite <a href="https://thefatemperor.com/published-papers-and-data-on-lockdown-weak-efficacy-and-lockdown-huge-harms/">extensive evience</a> that lockdowns don't work, and cause immense collateral damage.</p>
<p>In terms of stealing money, that was also a worldwide/US number. Since NZ is a much smaller economy, we should look at the actions of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (the central bank) specifically. In the RBNZ's <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/Publications/Annual%20Reports/Annual-report-2020.pdf?revision=c5f2a157-6cec-4c4e-83e5-bd7c97be83ec">annual report</a>, they show that from 2019 to 2020 they added $29.4 billion to their balance sheet, more than doubling it to $56.1 billion. This mirrors the actions of the US Federal Reserve, which printed over <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_recenttrends.htm">$3 trillion</a> in the span of three months back in March. All this money ends up filling the coffers of the banks, and the billionaires who own them, with the result that billionaires increased their wealth by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/07/covid-19-crisis-boosts-the-fortunes-of-worlds-billionaires">25%</a> from April to July. This article is spinning the real reason for that, but unless you understand how Keynesian economics works in the real world that is too much for me to explain here.</p>
<p>In terms of bankrupting the lower classes, no, it is not good for business in the long term. But the billionaire class is a parasite that is so ravenous that it is killing the host. In past centuries their theft was held in check by a relative lack of exploitative power, but with modern financial technology they are able to rape their populations so viciously that the entire system is destabilizing rapidly. In the long term it is not good for anybody, but they simply cannot help themselves. And the lower classes are so dumbed down by Netflix and Porn and MacDonalds that they don't put up the slightest fight. It is a pathetic reflection on all involved.</p>

<p>what the fuck are you talking about!?   so you think that the world is run by a one-world government controlled by rich families and kings of England, and that the NZ elections were rigged to get the noble blood of Jacinda Arden into office so she can control this area of the one-world government?  what about the highly noble key family? oh! what about the Clarkes?  is this the same for other countries?  </p>

<p>&rt;In the case of New Zealand, the repeated lockdowns acclimatizes citizens to sudden and arbitrary restrictions on their freedoms, with no guaranteed end date.</p>
<p>first of all, you make it sound like police come and lock our doors every five days, we've had three lockdowns (including the one we are in) all of which have an end date.    second of all two of those lockdowns are in one city so the majority of NZ has not gotten used to a lockdown, the majority of NZ hasn't locked down in almost a year.  </p>

<p>&rt;New Zealand's "success" can also be used to push the lockdown narrative to the global audience, despite <a href="https://thefatemperor.com/published-papers-and-data-on-lockdown-weak-efficacy-and-lockdown-huge-harms/">extensive evience</a> that lockdowns don't work, and cause immense collateral damage.</p>
<p>I kind of agree with you here.  I think that the lockdown is an essential part of a covid response plan but what's just as important is the infrastructure for testing, tracing and reacting to the pandemic.  in special circumstances, you don't even need the lockdown like in Taiwan which already had a pandemic response plan and had a trade route directly with Wuhan so they were some of the first to know about it.  so since they had all of this infrastructure they were able to do this without a lockdown.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; In the RBNZ's <a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/ReserveBank/Files/Publications/Annual%20Reports/Annual-report-2020.pdf?revision=c5f2a157-6cec-4c4e-83e5-bd7c97be83ec">annual report</a>, they show that from 2019 to 2020 they added $29.4 billion to their balance sheet, more than doubling it to $56.1 billion.</p>
<p>that is the covid relief fund.  that is savings meant for a rainy day.</p>

        <p>&rt; what the fuck are you talking about!? so you think that the world is run by a one-world government controlled by rich families and kings of England, and that the NZ elections were rigged to get the noble blood of Jacinda Arden into office so she can control this area of the one-world government?</p>
<p>Said in an incredulous tone and stripped of all nuance, yes, that is what I am saying. The same families that ruled the world a thousand years ago rule the world still (though there are obviously rivalries, and the families at the very top of the hierarchy are not the same now as then, for instance the Medicis are not nearly as strong now as they were in 1500). The only difference is that they now hide behind a fake democracy with rigged elections (giving people a meaningless vote makes them less likely to revolt). Taking as an example my country, Canada, Justin Trudeau descends directly from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Bandon">Earls of Bandon</a> in the Irish Peerage. In the US, the genealogies of all presidents can be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2183858/All-presidents-bar-directly-descended-medieval-English-king.html">traced back</a> to King John I of England (this article mainstream article excludes Van Buren, but more detailed genealogies can be found compiled elsewhere). Even in South Korea, Syngman Rhee, the first President of SK, ruling during the Korean War up until 1960, was descended from the ruling Joseon dynasty in 1367!  On the not-at-all-conspiratorial website <a href="https://famouskin.com/">FamousKin</a> you can see that practically all famous people are closely related. In general these families practice high levels of cousin marriage, to keep the money and influence within the family, and are highly positively and negatively ethnocentric (that is, they display high levels of reciprocal altruism within their ingroup, and parasitism and predation upon the outgroup).</p>
<p>Regarding politics, everyone public facing is simply a front for their cousins in banking or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Business_Network">Global Business Network</a> (GBN alum Peter Schwartz worked with the Rockefeller Foundation to publish the infamous <a href="https://thealterofdeceit.net/2020/05/09/rockefeller-foundation-paper-published-in-2010-lockstep/">Lockstep</a> document in 2010) or other globalist institutions that make the real decisions. All Trudeau, or Trump, or Biden, or Ardern do is read the teleprompter. They are Teleprompter-Reader in Chief. </p>
<p>About the Clarkes specifically, they are prolific in the English peerage. There are 1572 Clarkes in the peerage including the Baronets of Salford, Baronets of Rupertswood, Baronets of Dunham Lodge, and Baronets of Snailwell. Col. William Clarke was MI5 and led a (fake) mission to rescue the Romanovs. Gen. Sir Charles Clarke was Governor of Malta. Baron George Clarke was chairman of the British Empire League and Governor of Bombay. Sir Charles Clarke was director of the Swiss Bank Corp. 1992-4. Sir Rupert Clarke was chairman of the National Australia Bank. Charles Clarke was Home Secretary 2004-6. Kenneth Clarke was Home Secretary 1992-3, Chancellor of Exchequer 1993-7, and Father of the House of Commons 2017-2019. [The above clipped from the research of <a href="www.mileswmathis.com/updates.html">Miles Mathis</a>.] Yes, it is the same for all other countries. You can think of countries like little duchies controlled by various branches of the rulings families.</p>
<p>&rt; the majority of NZ hasn't locked down in almost a year</p>
<p>Count yourself lucky your government isn't quite as fascistic as it could be. Not all of us are that lucky.</p>
<p>&rt; I think that the lockdown is an essential part of a covid response plan</p>
<p>So you don't agree with me. Never before in history have healthy people been locked down in their homes, for months at a time in some places. It is a horrific abuse of human rights, and the scientific data indicates it produces no positive impact. If you will stand for lockdowns, you are not capable of defending a free society.</p>
<p>&rt; that is the covid relief fund</p>
<p>"We bought New Zealand Government bonds and Local Government Funding Agency bonds to provide stimulus to the economy and support market functioning."</p>
<p>"We ensured banks had access to liquidity [...]"</p>
<p>That's not a rainy day fund, that's printing money.</p>
