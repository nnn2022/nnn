    <strong>If the government can make it illegal private companies to boycott Israel then there's no reason they can't make it illegal to boycott and discriminate against conservatives..</strong>
    <p><p>From Banning people on social media to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2021/06/16/financial-blacklisting-wells-fargo-shuts-down-gop-senate-candidate-lauren-witzkes-bank-account/">disabling bank accounts</a> and even cutting off phone service as well as banning from companies like uber to restaurants themselves private companies have been discriminated against with many more people being fired or losing out on promotions due to their political beliefs. Conservatism and the Republican Party are mainstream political ideologies. You cannot have a functioning democracy with only one par</p>
<p>Government has displayed in the past but it not only has the ability but also the willingness to enforce legal action against companies that discriminate against groups that it protects. Whether that's minorities or gay people women religious groups or even Israel itself..</p>
<p>The government has displayed legal authority as well as a willingness to legally prevent voice and discrimination.. it's high time that we protect democracy and do the same conservatives.. you should not have to fear being banned from social media or having your bank account disabled because you openly spoke out against communism.</p>
<p>You should not have to worry that you will <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9033021/Elementary-school-principal-tells-fired-sharing-anti-Biden-conservative-memes.html">be fired from your job because you criticized the Democratic dictator on Facebook</a></p>
<p>You should not have to feer for your livelihood for speaking against <a href="https://archive.is/wip/IlFIu">terrorism</a></p>
<p>You should not be scared that you will be kicked out of your favorite restaurant because you voted for the other party. You should not be scared that your Uber account will be disabled because of your political beliefs. Or that your phone service will be cut off..</p>
<p>Private companies have shown that they are not trustworthy to be able to manage these situations themselves and it's high time that we the people stepped in and restricted themm</p>
<p>Like I said. The government's actions already displayed that they have the legal authority to do it and the willingness to do it.. and preventing gigantic mega corporations from discriminating against half the country is a far more noble cause than preventing some companies from boycotting Israel..</p>
<p>And as a forward I this is not an anti-israel post. I don't want the discussion to be about whether or not we should allow or disallow boycotting of israel..</p>
<p>But regardless of how you feel about it the government has shown that it can and would do such things. Which means that it can also prevent discrimination against conservative</p></p>
