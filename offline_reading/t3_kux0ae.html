    <strong>Top 11 Double Standards and Projections of 2020/21</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Left wing “fiery but mostly peaceful” protests are just fine for the past seven months, anything from the right is a coup, a riot and “domestic terrorism”. Has everyone forgotten what CHAD or CHAZ stood for? Which created more damage, went on longer, resulted in the most deaths?</li>
<li>Generalising about black people is prejudiced and racist, describing all white people as racist, guilty and oppressive is just fine. The insane and illogical notion that only white people can be racist</li>
<li>The left accusing enemies of election tampering with assistance from foreign countries for the last four years is just fine, but let’s not waste any time investigating it when, with evidence, the right accuses them of the same crimes</li>
<li>Examining and questioning the medical data is “fake news” while the leftist MSM can throw out outrageous non-factual claims, even when contradicted by their own reports and studies</li>
<li>Medical professionals and “science” should be universally trusted, unless those professionals and “the science” contradict the monolithic consensus narrative</li>
<li>Protesting racism (adversely affecting less than 15% of the population in the States and less than 5% of the U.K.) is more of a health/ social benefit than protesting unfair and unsubstantiated lockdowns which affect 100% of us</li>
<li>Publicising the verifiably dangerous effects and lack of testing of experimental vaccines is a no-no, while the MSM can shoot down already-proven treatments for COVID</li>
<li>BLM protests actually helping to protect citizens from COVID (by - I imagine - keeping the average citizen terrified by the coverage and indoors), while everyone else out there is a super-spreader</li>
<li>Politicians, VIPs and prominent scientists can visit lovers, go on holiday, to their favourite salons and restaurants, while still having the chutzpah to accuse the average citizen of killing grandma</li>
<li>Claiming to care about our health, while depriving us of all the basic ingredients to maintaining let alone maximising it (lack of sunlight, lack of vitamins and mineral recommendations, economic ruin, mental health stressors, poverty as the greatest driver of disease etc)</li>
<li>Deliberately and wilfully killing off the elderly in care homes to drive up initial COVID numbers, while still claiming to be doing all of this to protect them</li>
</ol>

<p>"Based on the prevalence of recently conducted attacks nationwide, White Racially Motivated (WRM)is currently the most violently active domestic terrorism type. Since2018, WRM actorswere responsible for at least three major attacks in the United States (including one in Texas), and severalthwarted incidents. </p>
<p>This activity outnumbered the other domestic terrorism types. While other types of domestic terrorism have shown threatening and forceful behavior, the loss of life fromrecent WRM attacks elevates the nature of this specific threat"</p>

(https://www.csis.org/analysis/rise-far-right-extremism-united-states)</p>
<p>"Right-wing extremism in the United States appears to be growing. The number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators rose over the past decade, more than quadrupling between 2016 and 2017."
"Right-wing attacks caused all fatalities resulting from terrorist attacks in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. They were responsible for more than 90 percent of fatalities in 1995, 2018, and 2019."</p>

<p>"The FBI has been warning about the threat of white nationalists and white supremacists for some time. They've said that white supremacists pose a threat to the nation, and they actually highlighted the fact that white supremacists have been quite effective in infiltrating American law enforcement. This is something that is not new. It is ongoing, and it's very dangerous."</p>
<p>In the U.S., far-right and nationalist organizations are heavily armed and are disproportionately the progenitors of violence. Antifa arise as a reaction to far-right movements and mostly seek to clash with them."</p>

<p>"In the almost 19 years since 9/11, jihadists have killed 107 people inside the United States. This death toll is similar to that from far-right terrorism (consisting of anti-government, militia, white supremacist, and anti-abortion violence), which has killed 114 people. The United States has also seen attacks in recent years inspired by black separatist/nationalist ideology and ideological misogyny. Individuals motivated by these ideologies have killed twelve and nine people respectively and those with Far-Left views have killed one person."</p>

<p>"Group members planned to set off devices at the beginning of the protest to cause panic and eventually a confrontation between police and the protesters, according to the report. But they ended up abandoning the plan in favor of efforts to firebomb an NV Energy substation and a federal ranger station at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.</p>
<p>The agent was next placed with members of the group on May 30, the day the three men were arrested before the downtown Black Lives Matter protest, court documents show. The FBI had learned that the trio was prepared to toss Molotov cocktails at police."</p>

<p>"There is empirical and anecdotal evidence that far-right hate groups pose a significant threat to public safety. Far-right extremists commit many violent attacks, and some scholars conclude that far-right extremists, especially groups motivated by religious ideology, are strong candidates to commit future acts using weapons of mass destruction (Gurr &amp; Cole, 2002; Tucker, 2001).

Similarly, a national survey of State law enforcement agencies concluded that there was significant concern about the activities of far-right extremist groups, and that more states reported the presence of far-right militia groups (92%), neo-Nazis (89%), and racist skinheads (89%) in their jurisdictions than Jihadi extremist groups (65%)"</p>
