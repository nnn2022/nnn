    <strong>The loss of taste/smell thing and 'long term symptoms' is hilariously angering to me</strong>
    <p><p>Because I've dealt with distorted/loss of smell since 2016 after losing my sense of smell with a common cold. To this day I still lose my smell or it becomes so distorted I feel like I'm breathing dust. Only spraying saline in my nose and laying on my back for a while brings it back. Sometimes it comes back overnight too. Sometimes none of those work.</p>
<p>I was so.. surprised people finally seemed to shed light on something that's bothered me for half a decade now and I thought maybe people would develop a treatment or look into how to fix it! Now I see memes and shit and realized it's just another covid joke. It annoys me a little because I bet all those people making tiktoks about their 'lost senses' actually dealt wtih a little dulled sense then recovered their whole range while I don't think I ever will- now not only is it a joke, I must have Covid too.</p>
<p>For example it was almost impossible to eat for years due to the distortion before I figured out 'my own trick' which is just laying down or spraying saline in my nose- doctors just called me anorexic and essentially crazy, saying it was psychological or an act so I could lose weight (I was a young woman at the time and had become underweight so...üôÑ). It still angers me when I just finish cooking only to lose my sense of smell. Or am going for a nice walk only for my sense to become so distorted I can't breathe or think so I just walk back.</p>
<p>But who cares unless it's covid I guess?</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone else has "long term effects" from other viruses that were just ridiculed and ignored by the healthcare system before this? I don't know why I'm saying this here but everyone else seems covid crazy and can't imagine a cold would do this too.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy shit I figured it out. Dysosmia. It can be caused by viral damage because (all viruses have the potential to cause damage) to the olfactory nerves. Can be treated by putting your head upside down and dropping saline in your nose. Weird how I figured that out. (And seizure medication to stop the damaged nerves misfiring)</p></p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same thing as what OP is talking about, but I absolutely have had loss of taste and smell with other illnesses that seemed like colds long before 2020 (phrasing it that way because I never sought medical diagnosis and I‚Äôm not a doctor.) I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs nothing earth-shattering about that. I found it strange, to be honest, that it was listed as a peculiar symptom in 2020. People with stuffed-up noses have difficulty smelling. Blocked olfactory leads to difficulty in experiencing taste, as was explained to me in elementary school, 35 years ago, way back when I ‚Äútrusted the science.‚Äù</p>
<p>As for OP, I have a dear friend who has always claimed to be unable to smell, to the confoundment of physicians and neurologists, whom usually express their exasperation in disbelief. I am a believer because more than once we have been in the same company when confronted by inhumane odors that had me desperately seeking escape but him unfazed.</p>

        <p>Yes, that‚Äôs absolutely normal with the cold.
I remember 10 years ago when for 2 weeks I completely hated everything I‚Äôd put in my mouth. Even my favorite dishes tasted like they were rotten.</p>

        <p>Are you allergic to NSAIDS?  It's common for people with Samter's Triad aka AERD to lose their sense of smell.  I've had it since 2004 and my sense of smell comes and goes. </p>
<p>It could be inflammation causing your loss of smell.  You may want to check to see if something in your diet is causing it.  </p>
<p>Another thing you can do is raise your vitamin D levels if they're low.  And take vitamin k2 with it.  I'll also supplement with zinc, quercetin, and vitamin C (the complete C not ascorbic acid).  This is what I've been doing since covid and my sense of smell came back.</p>

        <p>I may be, I don't take NSAIDS, they make me nauseous.</p>
<p>I take around 2000-3000 IU of D a day or every few days, and 500mg of C, it's not citrate or ascorbic acid- I'm mostly vegetarian now but used to be more paleo. All through that it's been the same shit.</p>
<p>Idk if zinc actually ruined my sense of smell, I just remembered I OD'd on it around the same time of the cold by accident.</p>

        <p>If anything this pandemic hopefully has woken people up to the rampant god complex and corruption in the medical industry. Doctors have all this power, and all it takes is one wrong diagnosis or them ignoring you to cause you years of health issues. I've had so many bad experiences with doctors that i hold them pretty much all with deep skepticism now.... used to be that i would be happy to see them, thinking "I'm here to get my problem fixed." Now, i show up and feel like "What bullshit 'diagnosis' are you going to come up with to ignore my problem today? How long before you essentially kick me out of your office since my problem isn't simple and you're a lazy asshole that doesn't want to refer me to an actual professional willing to ask the hard questions?"</p>
<p>They get so much praise and glory heaped on them, as if they're all super geniuses that are fixing people every waking minute or hour. Yet, i don't see it. Most of them, along with the nurses, just want to collect a paycheck and send you on your way, regardless of whether your issue(s) are truly resolved or not. They're more than happy to ignore or address symptoms, rather than work with you toward a real long term solution.</p>

        <p>Long term symptoms of covid are also respiratory problems. Like I have right now. Covid just gave me mild cold symptoms. And a week after I tought I was fine I wasn't able to do simple things like walking up stairs. And I was always healthy, my immunesystem works fine, I have a healthy lifestlye and I'm 51kilo on 1,60m.
You are right, doctors not talking your problems serious is disrespectful, but being disrespectful to other people won't solve your problem</p>

        <p>Lol I'm not trolling. I put my head in the kitchen sink for tmj jaw joint. I realise if you try breathing in with your nose its a great way of clearing your nose. Any mucous goes in your mouth and you just spit out. I've not drowned yet though only go under 10 seconds at a time.</p>
<p>Don't know if it may help but worth a try I guess.</p>

        <p>Loss of taste and smell permanently is one of the most common long term effects from covid because the inflammation caused by COVID can damage nerve endings. HOWEVER, many colds and common flu viruses can very much do the same. The longterm lung damage is caused from the pneumonia one could potentially have as a result of COVID and the heart damage is also due to an inflammatory response. These are reactions that are not 'novel' or unique to covid.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly. Viral damage is real, but seems very rare for colds and flus.</p>
<p>That cold seems to have actually damaged my nerves, because my nose is NOT stuffy or blocked. The nerves just don't work correctly.
Just.. no one seemed to believe it until Covid.</p>
