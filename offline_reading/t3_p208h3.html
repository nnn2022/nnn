        <p>Don't get so worked up, they're baiting you intentionally. It's their literal job. There's silver linings when you find the obvious bots spewing the same retorts as this one because they're intentionally trying to get people to look into things for themselves, and an illogical argument featuring insults is a good way to subliminally let the other know that their opinion is not based in fact but rather feeling. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense, but people are equally trying to get people to do their own research even if it doesn't appear that way. You can easily get them to delete their comments and posts when you say simple things like "everyone knows what you are, it's obvious what you're doing". I'm very fond of the bots, they're part of a system that we only interpret one side of. Their arguments are not for the educated, but the more you carry on the conversation the more apparent that is. They will literally go full retard to give away the fact they don't mean anything they're saying.</p>
<p>Just thought I'd share my take on bots after having a few openly admit what they're doing.</p>

        <p>That person sounded like a bot/ agitator.  </p>
<p>Well, I indulged because I wasn't gonna back away just because they're mass downvoting me, either coherently disprove my argument or shut up... When it got to the 5 year old trolling though I bowed out, I don't have that sorta time to waste.</p>

        <p>Bro my posts don't lift off of 0 upvotes despite constant notifications. All it does is reinforce whatever I posted to the natural lurker, people are more inclined to read downvoted comments and 0 upvoted posts with hundreds of comments. Take it as a compliment, it means you're onto something. I understand getting irritated though, but after you realize what they're doing it feels kind of foolish to entertain lol</p>
<p>If you're looking for them to disprove you in an intellectual debate, they won't, that's the entire point lol they want you to look like the more educated source intentionally.</p>

        <p>Your post is still incredibly important I wasn't trying to discredit anything you're saying! Their argument is very fucking stupid lmao I agree. There is real life people regurgitating their information unfortunately, but I think they're a very special, and honestly more rare than we think, breed of people.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I would hope so, but it is so hard to tell who is genuine or not. Reddit in general (due to the nature of the downvote system) discourages intelligent discourse. If someone is losing a debate, they can all just mass downvote you into oblivion, especially if you are the contradicting voice in their space.</p>

        <p>Wait until you start questioning the bots in reality lmao they malfunction just as bad, and it is hard to distinguish if they're real or not as well. The world is more fabricated than we think, I just hope you hold onto your sanity during these huge narrative shifts. Best  of luck ðŸ¥° if you feel compelled to argue with them please don't let my words stop you, we all feel compelled in different ways to spread the truth. This could be yours!</p>

        <p>Best of luck out here talking to bots though it's really fun when you break one down and start a straight up normal conversation about favorite colors and shit. I'm biased towards them, but they really are just people trying to push a flimsy narrative intentionally. Some cave and admit and delete their accounts and move on, but I still see majority lurking after they've openly been called out and dismissed. They have a job to do just as much as we do.</p>
