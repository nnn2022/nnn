        <p>Don’t be afraid of the eyes, folks!</p>
<p>This is a little advice for those who know there is a scam going on but are too afraid to go into shops without a mask.</p>
<p>About four times a week I have to enter a busy high street shop in the U.K. There are always people in there, usually about five to ten, and always people I don’t know.</p>
<p>This has been going on for a few months and I never wear a mask.</p>
<p>Most of the time, I don’t see anyone else without a mask.</p>
<p>Probably one tenth of the time, I do, and we always make eye contact, sometimes there is a small smile or a”alright, mate” even though we don’t know each other. It’s like we acknowledge that we know what is going on.</p>
<p>The rest just STARE.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten used to the stare now, but at first it felt very uncomfortable. I reckon this stare is the biggest hurdle those have to get over when they don’t want to wear a mask, but do anyway.</p>
<p>During these months, not one person has ever commented on my lack of mask. NOT ONCE.</p>
<p>But why the STARES?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you.</p>
<p>A small portion are thinking “oh how bad” but haven’t got the bottle to say anything. Fuck them. I reckon it really is a small portion else someone would have the bottle within that pool of people and would say something. They never have.</p>
<p>Another portion don’t care and are just doing what they’re told. These are safe to ignore.</p>
<p>But a good portion are thinking, maybe I should be doing what he’s doing - Shit, I wish I didn’t have mine on now.</p>
<p>The stares look worse to the amateur non mask wearer because the rest of the starer’s face is covered. Don’t assume that they are thinking the worse. If they all were, someone would have said something to me. </p>
<p>So remember, some stares are people thinking good things, and these people <em>stare in the same way</em> , so don’t be afraid.</p>
