    <strong>Posting again—advice about my daughter’s school</strong>
    <p><p>My daughter is in first grade and she loves school. She loves her teacher, her friends, riding the bus, the actual school building, literally everything about her school. But she HATES virtual days. The district has flip flopped from hybrid, fully in-person (for 6 days) , back to hybrid, then in person again for a week and now fully virtual until end of January (started a week ago). It’s been a mess and I don’t trust that they will even go back after that since our governor has mandated strict covid quarantining policies and our teachers union has pushed back at every step. The union actually is behind this latest push to fully virtual bc they threatened a sick out.</p>
<p>My husband and I decided to pull her out of school and put her in a Catholic school that has been open fully this entire year and has no plans of shutting down. I’m just having reservations about a) putting her in a religious school since we are not religious b) taking her away from a school and teacher she loves and c) worrying that our district actually might got back full time after this and I’ll have put her through this major change for nothing. I spoke w her current teacher and she said the principal (both are desperate to go back full time) said that after this the administration said they are going back full time and they are using this “shut down” to come up w a really solid plan. Why they didn’t have a plan to start with, I don’t know. I honestly think they never wanted to go back full time and they just made a deal w the teachers union to do the switch to remote if the district can go back fully after it is over. Furthermore this is a really excellent district and our taxes are high bc it is such a good district but they just were not prepared and didn’t have a good leader. I’d like for her to attend it in the future but I’m so pissed of at what they are doing to these little children. Her teacher is very good and she does a great job at teaching virtually but it does not live up to having a teacher in front of you. Also this new school is very small and I always get worried about small schools, too many chances for cliques. The public school she is in is very big and there’s no chance of cliques bc you never have the same kids in your class year to year.</p>
<p>Am I being to rash in making this decision? Any other parents out there who have made switch bc of COVID? What if this actually does all end in March/April, we’ve made it this far what’s a few more months? Anyone else go to small school that can give any insight?</p></p>

        <p>Go catholic an monitor closely.    You can always go back but do you think the teachers union is going to change their mind?  They are half assing it  for full pay. No discipline problems,   etc.    Do a shit job, kids don't learn, not my fault, covid.</p>
<p>Did he share any of this plan with youth?  The principal doesn't have a plan.   He's had 8 months to come up with a plan.  He had all summer vacation to get a plan,  Still no plan.  His school loses money if your daughter leaves the average in the US is about 7k per pupil  do you think that entered your conversion?</p>
<p>I originally said 2023 for normal.  Now I think that was optimistic. </p>
<p>Now a further point,  do you know any of these catholics?   Do you think they hate their kids?  How can they be open and your school can't?   Are their teachers hiding at home?  Will they care less about your daughter?</p>
