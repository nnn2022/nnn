    <strong>Family Dynamics help</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if this the right place....</p>
<p>My partner and mother of my child, refuses to entertain any conversation regarding plandemic/covid... tells me to ignore what’s happening and just be happy... (during 2nd U.K. lockdown)
Shes a non conspiracy believer - but isn’t in a panic fear state (still sees her dad and sister allowing for social bubble reasons) </p>
<p>My daughter has suffered 2 febrile convulsions due to high temperatures from fevers in the space of 4 weeks (tested negative for covid each time and due to ear infection presumably) 
She gets a cold/flu from the kids in her nursery/kindergarten ... pretty much every week - which is normal in that environment, but we manage that well.
Both times she was taken into A&amp;E via ambulance and I was unable to even see her while she was there - left at home biting my nails (not literal)</p>
<p>We are struggling to get seen at the doctors and dentist to figure out the cause of her fevers </p>
<p>My mental state is degrading due anxiety about daughter’s health and also being lockdown/social distancing which has meant I’ve not had any physical interaction with my own family and friends since March 2020.</p>
<p>My grandfather passed away alone in the 1st U.K. (March 2020) lockdown and my own fear/lockdown rules meant I did not attend his funeral
My father had a heart attack and wasn’t allowed visitors in June 2020 - thankfully recovered and is fine now. 
My grandmother passed away alone in July 2020, but this time my lack of fear meant I attended the funeral and I’m so glad for it. I proudly carried her coffin to the crematorium and was able to say goodbye </p>
<p>What can I do? </p>
<ul>
<li>I need my daughter to be seen medically and not be fobbed off for a video call only... or to be told the earliest appointment is in December </li>
<li>I want to feel okay</li>
<li>I want my partner to question the narrative and conclude her own thoughts</li>
<li>I need to understand if the differences between myself and my partner regarding critical thinking is beyond repair or beyond compatibility</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sure there are many people who are in a whole worse place than I am. And I do not want to distract the help given to these guys, by people on this sub. 
Happy to be patient about any responses </p>
<p>My thanks 
J</p></p>

        <p>If she can see her family, you should go see yours. </p>
<p>I hope your daughter gets help. Meanwhile, have you looked into vitamins that help strengthen her immune system? </p>
<p>I wish you peace of mind during all of this. It sounds very hard.</p>

        <p>Febrile seizures aren’t super uncommon in young children.  They are terrifying BUT thankfully benign and she will outgrow them.  Hang in there it must be really tough.</p>

        <p>Thank you
Yes that is what the doctors and everything I have read say. Totally scary, the first time it happened she was in my arms and I thought she was playing around after she had woke up. 
They say that after the age of 3 she the risk will be very minimal</p>

        <p>I would think exercise and supplements could help, watch what you eat, what you drink and how you breath. There are some subs here for breathing methods which have excellent info and help with environmental stress in general.</p>
