    <strong>As It Inevitably Succumbs To Globalist Pressures, Sweden’s COVID Initial Success Story Is Also A Globalist Cautionary Tale Of Existing Universal Evils and Of Things To Come...(From A Friend)</strong>
    <p><p>I am of course anti-lockdown and understand now that the COVID is pretty much the seasonal flu on every metric level, so it was depressing to see today that Sweden has succumbed to globalist pressure and has begun to institute partial lockdowns:</p>

<p>“When we think of Sweden we think of a freedom-loving people just wanting to be left alone to enjoy a spot of hide the potatiskorv in the sauna.</p>
<p>However, I've always been suspicious of the Swedish government like I am of all governments. It's a country that has always been at the forefront of pushing for a cashless society - part of the PTB’s NWO agenda. I would not be surprised if Sweden is being set up as the fall guy to eventually end the lockdown argument by pointing to the only country that tried to resist it and “failed”. A warning to all others who try in future years.</p>
<p>For now all I can say for sure is that around 70% of the Swedish deaths were care home deaths. They culled their vulnerables early and in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>A friend sent round an article in 2017 about “Flu jab blunder brought unexpected benefits for Britain’s pension black hole”. £28bn was saved. Neither a blunder nor unexpected. Now the culling machinery has been ramped up to holocaust levels.</p>

<p>Wall Street Journal - 18 June 2020</p>
<p>“Many people have died unnecessarily,” said Yngve Gustafson, a geriatric-medicine specialist in Sweden, who looked into more than 200 cases in which people were denied care. He said that doctors were too quick to put patients on palliative care. He also said that he believed many would have survived and lived year longer had they been provided basic care.</p>
<p>Dr. Gustafson also spoke to the Svebsja Dagbladet newspaper and “expressed concern about the increasing practice of doctors recommending by telephone a “palliative cocktail” for sick older people in care homes.</p></p>

        <p>So not only they are lying about the numbers in their own countries, they use translators to lie about what's actually happening in others.</p>

        <p>If you are a "lowly" translator, and know that you are being told to say otherwise is different from the source, then they are being complicit in all this.  </p>
<p>Yes, the elites have most of the power, but individuals play a part too. Humans have something called a conscience you know? It's when you are doing something wrong and it bothers you. There's a nagging thought in the back of your mind.</p>
