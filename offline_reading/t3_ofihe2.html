    <strong>Is there a large collection of vaccine death stories from social media to share with the door-to-door propagandist that is going to come knocking?</strong>
    <p><p>If they come to my house I want to invite them in and just start reading accounts of people dying from the vaccine until they get annoyed enough to leave or quit. </p>
<p>I know there was a "frontline workers" report or something awhile back that had a lot of screenshots from social media about covid injection injuries. </p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>I think most of us won’t be answering our door . Not worth it to give them any information. It will come back to bite you if they escalate things. Right now they cannot
Hold you down and force you. If that becomes the case then it’s a whole new dialogue. It’s scary that they are even doing this. It’s a scare tactic. If they have to go
Door to door to convince the ones that don’t want a vaccine that’s even more of a red flag to me NOT to get one. I just hope
Things don’t escalate.</p>
