        <p>It's your fault because people like you refused to stay home, self isolate, and follow distancing guidelines. If everyone did that, the pandemic would be long over even without a vaccine, and no new variants would have spawned. Of course, governments that let this happen are also very much at fault, whether through downplaying the disease or refusing to do proper tracing and restrictions.</p>

        <p>I tend to think for myself, I think most people do. The issue is, as you point out, with the quality of available data to base opinions on. To ameliorate that, I fouind a good way is to take data from a variety of sources and try to accountfor the bias of the sources to get the full picture. Or, well, as close to a full picture as we can get with the limited time and resources we have. Then again, if you cared about independent thinking you'd at least try the Socratic method instead of giving in to paranoia.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be derisive, this really is paranoid thinking. Or at the very least, extremely cynical. You don't like the "new normal", I get that, I don't like it either. But ignoring the pandemic won't make it go away. The best way to get things back to normal was to quickly and decisively snuff out the virus. But, people like you resisted temporary measures (and don't quote Milton Friedman or the proverbs that inspired him), making them less effective and therefore required for longer. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy you weave here.</p>
<p>I'll remind you of an actually fitting proverb, a cheap man pays twice. It's a good methaphor for what I'm seeing here. The proverb means trying to pay as little as possible for equipment just means you'll have to spend even more to replace or repair it. Similarly, trying to rush a job to do it faster often makes it take longer due to mistakes. That's exactly what's happened with this pandemic. By trying to limit how many changes you were willing to tolerate, you ended up extending the necessity for these changes. Not you personally, obvioulsy I don't know you, but the usual members of this sub, and even many governments. </p>
<p>Now, the trick is to learn from the last year and a half and figure out how best to get back to some semblance of normalcy. OF course, it won't be exactly the same, but things change all the time and the world wasn't exactly perfect to begin with. So, with everything we know now and the situation as it is, what's the best way to get back those things you miss about how things were? What needs to change? What can be restored and what will be replaced by something else? I really want to know how you envision the world should proceed.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your response. <br>
I do not agree nor believe that Covid is half as bad as what lying media and corrupt governments are portraying.  The mask are useless and cause more harm than good, lockdowns have done nothing but harm us mentally and many businesses have been permanently closed down because of a flu like virus.<br>
I’m by no means paranoid, hence why Ive stopped wearing the muzzle and live my life as normal as possible.  I have a few health issues, that if Covid is as deadly as what is claimed,  I should have gotten Covid when my husband had it for 3 days with mild symptoms back in March 2020, and died.  Yet, here I am unfortunately. 🤷🏼‍♀️</p>
<p>How do you figure I’m paranoid when I live my life like normal now?  Paranoid, are the people still wearing masks and worried about the so called “variants” we keep hearing about.  And isn’t it odd that the vaxxed are the ones who are getting Covid and filling the hospitals now, even more than the untaxed?  Strange. </p>
<p>Oh, I am definitely cynical and for a very good reason, as Ive seen in my long life, much corruption by our disgusting government and msm has been lying to us for decades now.  So I see through all this Covid crap and what the agenda for it is, just as many of us have now.  Maybe someday you will finally see it too.  I just hope you do not have to find out in a detrimental way.<br>
What needs to change and how do we get back to normal?  Easy, take off the masks, turn off the news and go out and live your life.  I’m telling you, it’s a wonderful feeling going out and doing normal things now.  You should try it. 
I wish you the best.</p>

        <p>&rt;I’m telling you, it’s a wonderful feeling going out and doing normal things now. You should try it.</p>
<p>Oh I know. I'm in New Zealand, so apart from lack of tourists we've been back to normal for a year or so. All because we closed our border and did a stringent lockdown with contact tracing.</p>
<p>&rt;government and msm has been lying to us for decades now</p>
<p>OK, yes, BUT: Suppose tomorrow a virus as bass as all the COVID claims are pops up. How do you expect the media to report on it? How would you know if it's true? By all means, mistrust the media and especially government, but sometimes bad things happen naturally, not by design. How do you tell what's a lie and what's actually happening?</p>
<p>&rt;And isn’t it odd that the vaxxed are the ones who are getting Covid and filling the hospitals now, even more than the untaxed? Strange. </p>
<p>That would be strange. I'm not seeing that happen tho. It's happening in Russia because their vaccine is garbage, and I don't know how China is doing with their Sinovac, but the shots we're getting over here aren't causing anything like that.</p>
<p>&rt;The mask are useless and cause more harm than good</p>
<p>Masks significantly reduce aerosol spread, you can test it yourself or look up simple demonstrations on YouTube. As for their negative health effects, only one I know is a problem with people breathing through their mouth all day.</p>
<p>&rt;lockdowns have done nothing but harm us mentally and many businesses have been permanently closed down</p>
<p>That I somewhat agree with. Not fully, but yes, lockdowns in many parts of the world have been somewhat ineffective and have caused significant damage to businesses and individuals. The ineffectiveness isn't inherent tho, it's their arbitrary application and lack of enforcement that's the problem. The damage they do should have been limited by making them relatively short and offering financial aid to affected people. That one is entirely on the incompetence or malice of governments.</p>
<p>&rt;because of a flu like virus</p>
<p>Technically a coronavirus, different family from the influenza ones. The main difference is that it's a lot more infectious and a small percent of people have a severe or fatal reaction to it, a bit like an allergy. You got lucky in that you either didn't catch it or were just asymptomatic. Many others weren't so lucky. </p>
<p>&rt;How do you figure I’m paranoid</p>
<p>Well, the view you're presenting requires global cooperation of media, scientists, doctors, and governments to maintain the lie. I just don't think they're THAT competent. At the same time, we can fairly easily see where governments like Russia are actually trying to hide their infection and death numbers, something they wouldn't have to do if the virus wasn't so severe. Beyond that, maintaining that all these lies are being maintained as a joint global effort to clamp down on freedoms in total concert by nations that repeatedly demonstrate adversarial or outright hostile relationships... Seems a little paranoid as it requires a ton of baseless assumptions beyond just mistrust in msm and government.</p>
<p>Large part of my view is influenced by me being in New Zealand. If the virus really was significantly overstated to restrict citizenry, why has my government lifted practically all restrictions within the country? And if they're going rogue against the rest, why maintain the lie?</p>

        <p>Watties Sauce: I'm in New Zealand, that's what we did and we're practically back to normal. Have been for a year. Only times anything gets upset is when a tourist brings the bug in from overseas. That's why we're not fully back, can't have tourism until the rest of the world beats the virus back too.</p>

        <p>I figured you'd be from an island. We mainlanders have to accept the fact that unless we want to completely shut down the borders, (i.e. impossible) the virus will always be among us. Also the claim was stay home, self isolate, and social distancing guidelines, was it not?</p>

        <p>Wouldn't need to shut down borders if everyone did the same thing. Instead, there are breeding grounds for the virus that we have to isolate from. But yeah, during lockdown we couldn't travel between cities, so essentially city borders were shut. If borders were the problem, places closer to the border would have higher infection rates, but that's not what we see.</p>

        <p>I hope that I dont have to tell you that getting everyone to do the same thing was a pipedream to begin with, so Ill skip that for now.</p>

<p>But thats only because of immigration, presumably - Mexico is one of the places where it is extreme because a lot of immigrants were coming in on foot. That happens all the time at our borders too. Its less noticable because we still used planes and cars. Planes and cars are awesome because when you get out of them, you arent always at, or anywhere near, the border. There is almost no case stemming from motorway stops.</p>
<p>But all that doesnt matter, because you want to lockdown everything, not just borders. Inter-city travel, too. If everyone just did that, the virus would dissapear. And that would work! If nobody moves, the disease dies. Best would be if every country in the world did the same thing (wouldnt work any other way)! Then not only covid, but almost all diseases would finally be rid of the face of the earth. I wonder why we never did that, actually.</p>
<p>Trying to eradicate covid would be comparable to checking if any STI-infected person is having unprotected sex, with the difficulty that about half of all STI-infected dont know if they are STI-infected, and you dont know they are either. But you still get europe on board with it. But third-world countries? Some dont even have the means to do the necessary policing. NZ will never fully open back up, because covid will never, ever, dissapear.</p>
<p>Damn, I guess I got into the futility of it after all.</p>

        <p>When the entire globalist power structure informs you that you are being 'great reset', an obvious euphemism for a 'great leap forward' - why would you accept these same people demanding you lockdown arbitrarily?</p>
<p>It just baffles me. I simply do not understand the willingness to ignore what we have been told the real goal is of these events.. I feel truly isolated in that almost no one even knows about this 'great reset' rhetoric, or that China now leads the UN human rights council while openly operating concentration camps and massive modern slavery, etc.</p>
<p>I am convinced the globalists want Eastern style slavery in the west, and I do not see why people more serious than myself are not DOING SOMETHING FFS.</p>

        <p>Nah. I have a long list of links, which I will paste below for you to check out. The people who know what 'great reset' even is refuse to discuss it - or online you find people suspiciously passionate about either denying or supporting the rhetoric and goals of the 'great reset'</p>

        <p>While the WEF messaging on the great reset is all over the place, the basic idea is valid. We do need to redesign our economies, especially in the wake of COVID. Sure, adding Marxism into the mix is a bad idea, but there are better ways.</p>

<p>They began having their propagandists whisper these terms in our ears even before the first 2 weeks to slow the curve were up. We have seen elderly well-connected plutocrats like Nancy Pelosi ignore the lockdowns.</p>
<p>the lockdowns are a psychological warfare attack. This is the only way to make sense of them. From a health policy point of view makes no sense. From an economic POV makes no sense unless you understand how global finance works post-LIBOR fixing revelations and the 2008 bailouts.</p>
<p>Covid = globalist psyop.</p>
