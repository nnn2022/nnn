        <p>Seriously everytime anyone goes against the powers to be they are subjected to an intense over sensationalized false smear campaign.  And I see fools on Redfit perpetuating the lies. Just because they disagreed with Dr. Wakefield didn't make him deserving of the way the treated him. If you cant question things then that defeats the point of science.</p>

        <p>I have to ask, what exactly did “they” do to him that he didn’t deserve. Because spreading misinformation (trough a scientific journal might I add) and convincing hundreds of thousands of parents to not vaccinate their kids, therefore risking many lives, is really bad.</p>

        <p>Its because 'scientific consensus' didn't have any problems with the study until Dr. Andrew accepted to be the expert witness against MMR manufacturer. Thats when the big pharma started pulling the strings to spoil the study. Also the court exonerated Dr. Walker Smith, the study's co author from all charges and threw GMCs decision of revoking his license, out. Dr. Wakefield didn't go for further appeal because he said he has taken a new path of educating the people now.</p>

        <p>Have you considered the possibility that the “consensus” could be fraudulent or acting in compliance to keep their careers or laboratories in good standing? They need funding right, if the drug companies don’t like the information or data they’re showing, they don’t have an incentive to pay.</p>

        <p>I have considered it very unlikely. Mostly the consensus comes from independent studies, which wouldn’t be funded by pharma companies. They would be funded by the government, some medical journal or an university. </p>
<p>Yes, there is a chance that an “independent” study might be funded by pharma, but if uncovered (for ex. oxycontin) the company will face serious legal problems.</p>
<p>Even if a study found something not liked by the pharma companies, that wouldn’t mean that they will necessarily be discredited. If the study is true, this imaginary pharma company would lose money, because no one would like to sell this unsafe product, forcing them to abandon the product or fix it.</p>
<p>Sometimes pharma companies’ data may be flawed, but to get a vaccine even emergency approved, the government institutions and independent studies have to check that data and conclude the product safe. Vaccines are among the most regulated products in medicine. I see no reason to trust a democratic, stable government.</p>

        <p>Dr. Andrew Wakefield published a study linking Autism to the MMR vaccine in 1998. 10 of the 13 partipicants withdrew their names from the study, and it has been debunked numerous times by studies with sometimes millions of participants.</p>
<p>This is why he lost his license. A false study. Not because ”He only was kind and compassionate to his patients”. Wakefield is now an anti-vax activist. This is why he is labelled as ”disgraced”.</p>
<p>Also, his ”study” is the most cited study withdrawn from a scientific journal, being cited over 700 times. </p>
<p>According to the Associated press:</p>
<p>Immunization rates in Britain dropped from 92 percent to 73 percent, and were as low as 50 percent in some parts of London. The effect was not nearly as dramatic in the United States, but researchers have estimated that as many as 125,000 US children born in the late 1990s did not get the MMR vaccine because of the Wakefield splash.</p>
<p>He spread dangerous misiformation, convincing dozens of people to not get the MMR shot, casting doubt on it.</p>
<p>Here’s his lovely wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield</p>

        <p>Yes he took kids blood at birthday party, for testing. But he took parents consent. They all knew it was for MMR study. They were part of study. No parents or children complained. Taking blood for test with parents consent is illegal? What nonsense are you talking? They just found an administrative loophole- that he didn't take ethics committee approval before taking blood sample outside the hospital. They just wanted some mistake from his side, after he agreed to be expert witness against MMR manufacturer. Come on, its too much. You are talking as if he took the blood to drink it. Don't be so dramatic. Go to any hospital in the world, they take blood for testing ok?</p>
