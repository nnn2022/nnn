        <p>I wish this were true. Some states have adopted CDC guidance in their own rules by reference. For example, a governor might order businesses to follow current CDC guidance. I'm not saying I like it, or I think we should all listen to the CDC (I don't), I'm just saying unfortunately this isn't true in all cases.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah I know. Every business here requires a mask to enter. Not because they want to, but if they don't, some local Karen snitch will report them, and they'll be facing a $10,000 fine from the state. And once the state puts you in their crosshairs. there's nothing their hall monitor bureaucrats won't do to destroy you.</p>

        <p>To be quite honest I wish it were illegal. I'm not sure legislatures should be empowered to delegate their authority to a foreign body like that. They've been able to delegate legislative authority to the executive branch through legislation. So for example, the legislature wrote emergency powers acts enabling governors to create legally binding orders in an "emergency."</p>
<p>It's an interesting question though as to whether the governor could then write an order which delegated the authority he's already been delegated.</p>
<p>Legislature gets their legislative authority from the state Constitution --&rt; Legislature delegates that legislative power to the Executive through some kind of statute giving the governor legislative powers during an emergency ---&rt; Governor makes an order delegating rulemaking authority to the CDC</p>
<p>Not sure that's how the founders would have drawn it up...</p>

        <p>It says right in the title and throughout the paper, <strong>for influenza</strong>.</p>
<p>That's exactly why they said regular people people in America shouldn't wear masks in the beginning, because they hadn't been shown to be useful in general population in our previous epidemics, which were almost all influenza.</p>
<p>Data for covid specifically has shown that masks actually are effective for this specific disease, which made the CDC to eat their words because they screwed up by assuming it would be like influenza.</p>

        <p>Why should we wear masks when the actual science says they are useless? The recent report from the World Health Organization,  <a href="https://i.redd.it/mp87nae7w1s61.jpg">clearly states that the efficacy of masks for healthy people is undetermined</a> and makes little to no difference in transmission.</p>
<p>It seems most people who are screaming about wearing masks aren't following the science and data, but repeating the news, engaging in religious zealotry, and ignoring the studies that don't confirm your existing beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the full quote from the Study:</strong></p>
<p>At present there is only limited and inconsistent scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (75). A large randomized community-based trial in which 4862 healthy participants were divided into a group wearing medical/surgical masks and a control group found no difference in infection with SARS-CoV-2 (76). A recent systematic review found nine trials (of which eight were cluster-randomized controlled trials in which clusters of people, versus individuals, were randomized) comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks to prevent the spread of viral respiratory illness. Two trials were with healthcare workers and seven in the community. <strong>The review concluded that wearing a mask may make little or no difference to the prevention of influenza-like illness</strong> (ILI) (RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.82 to 1.18) or laboratory confirmed illness (LCI) (RR 0.91, 95%CI 0.66-1.26) (44); the certainty of the evidence was low for ILI, moderate for LCI.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the WHO Report from 4 months ago: Page 8 Paragraph 1</strong>   </p>
<p>https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak</p>
<p>And it doesn't matter that they are recommending masks. These organizations and health officials all want to be seen as "doing something" instead of "doing nothing". Even if that "something" (masks) doesn't have any data or science to back up their efficacy. Masks have also been used as way to create a scapegoat (non-mask wearers). That way people like you can feel morally superior, while ignoring the actual data, and the glaringly obvious 4th grade fact that you just can't stop viral spread.</p>

        <p>I was curious about this as well but supposedly the CDC does have some authority and is apparently responsible for the current airline requirements.  " The CDC, as the U.S.’s primary agency for taking action to stop the spread of disease, has broad authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to restrict travel into the country and between states of an infected person or a person who has come in contact with an infected person, according to Laura Donohue, director of the Center on National Security and the Law at Georgetown Law School. Federal quarantine can be imposed, too, on federal property, like a military base or National Forest land.  "</p>
