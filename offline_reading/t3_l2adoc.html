    <strong>You're delusional if you think the Democrats are going to relinquish this amount of power</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of skeptics thinking that now Trump is out and Biden's in, they'll do a complete 180 on lockdowns. Democrats want to re-open the economy for multi-national corporations, not small businesses. Small businesses will continue to get crushed under lockdown mandates while big corporations are allowed to re-open unfettered.</p>
<p>Democrats now have the power to choose who can run a business, who can gather, who can protest, and what you can say or see online. Why would they ever give that up? Never let a good crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>Americans are living in the modern equivalent of Nazi Germany. The Democrats are looking to emulate the CCP and have complete control of the economy and the people. If you think the government is just going to leave you alone, you haven't been paying attention.</p></p>

        <p>This is the real truth.  Congress realized making deals and finding fair compromise is hard work and they'd rather spend more time campaigning and creating propaganda images than acting like a legislature.  It's part of why their approval rating has been below 15% for decades now.  </p>
<p>The federal government needs a reset, and people are starting to realize it.  That's why they brought in 25k military troops to protect themselves from the very people they claim to govern.</p>

        <p>As far as I can tell most of them (I only read 17 of them) are 100% in his power as the chief executive officer. His restrictions, and defunding, and international relations were all without overreach, even if I don't agree. Most were just resolutions meaning "this is the direction I want to go for this issue".</p>
<p>I'm not a Biden supporter, but if I were a rattlesnake, this only warrants rattling when Biden goes against his own policy.</p>

        <p>Nah I don't. You say you're from the UK so I get you not understanding. Executive orders don't require a vote. The president can pass them on their own. </p>
<p>Historically they're often time passed in large number early in a candidacy. 25 day one is high but he's got (in his opinion) a lot to do. Trump used his executive orders for a variety of purposes as will biden. If you want an example of dangerous presidential power look at the pardon.</p>

        <p>Well so did Obama. How far back does it need to be to be the modern precedent? I'm not sure how that's defined but I feel like at this point you'd be hard pressed to elect a president who doesn't pass a ton of executive orders early and often. Maybe my statement was a stretch, but I certainty wouldn't call it abnormal or suprising. Either way I couldn't agree more with your last sentiment. Politics is all very gross.</p>

        <p>Obama did not originate the practice. T Roosevelt did, mainly because the US federal government grew a lot starting then. In the post WWII period the number signed per year has trended downward FDR signed near 3600</p>
<p>Obama (276) did fewer than Bush(281) who did less than Clinton (364). Clinton though may have done a few more than what Bush senior would have done (166 in 4 years). Reagan did 381. Carter did quite a lot at 320 (4 years).</p>
<p>Trump in 4 years did 220, which was the most in a term since Carter.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the case here, except that it's less publicised and formalised. During the run-up to dissolution of parliament, Opposition shadow cabinet have privileged access to the civil service appropriate to their role in preparation for taking over as government. If they succeed, the civil service are given their new mission statements. This is essentially what executive orders are and do.</p>

        <p>I've heard lots about China over the past 2 years. Their treatment of Africans in their own country is concerning as is that of the Uiguyrs (not sure that's how you spell them). The 1984 level of censorship is also concerning too.</p>

        <p>Uighurs are monitored everywhere they go. Security cameras stationed on every corner can immediately identify them, Uighurs are dependent on the government for money and can only spend it through a digital app, so everything they spend and where they spend it is tracked. They have routine house searches for religious paraphernalia and other things. They are thrown into concentration camps for even the smallest transgression, like not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>China is an easier concept to understand.  It's a lot easier to think a foreign government wants to take us over because throughout most of history, only governments had that level of power and influence.  </p>
<p>Its a lot harder to face the fact that most of this being done just to increase growth and marginal profits for huge companies like Amazon and the silicon valley cartel, who contribute millions to political campaigns for politicians who agree to act in their interest.  </p>
<p>Like if I told you the US under Biden is probably going to invade Syria under the thin disguise of humanitarianism so new pipelines can be built from Iraq to Europe solely to stabilize marginal profits from Amazon prime memberships in Europe by ensuring stability in energy prices, there is a really good chance you'd think I'm crazy.  If I said it was going to happen because the US is imperialist and racist, you'd be more likely to agree with me, even though that explanation is nonsensical and meaningless.</p>

        <p>Idk about that.  I think they're crashing it so a few massive corporations can take over markets completely without fear of competition with new and small businesses funded by personal savings and credit.  </p>
<p>Thats why they keep printing new money.  They're literally stealing our savings by devaluing them through inflation.  Next they're coming after guns so we can no longer resist should we find the will to.  Its most obvious by the way they're coming after "assault weapons", a class of weapons very rarely used in the commission of crime compared to other types of firearms, but are useful and effective small arms in combat.  They know the people will rise up if given the opportunity before becoming slaves to the state.</p>

        <p>I dont think they actually do.  I can't say I've come across a single person recently who isn't of the opinion that the government is incompetent or malicious.  That's a huge change from just a year ago.  </p>
<p>I think its just a tiny but vocal minority being amplified by the press.  There's a reason Biden had his inauguration in front of an empty Mall and surrounded by military protection.  It wasn't because he's the most popular presidential candidate in US history.</p>
<p>Shit, less than 10% of Americans view political correctness favorably, yet its apparantly the whole reason Biden was elected.  Something stinks.</p>

        <p>Just wait until DC and PR become states, the Supreme Court is stacked, massive amnesty for illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship and the electoral is abolished. Then the democrats will have a permanent super majority. If that happens the USA will balkanize without a doubt. Deep red states will see no point in being part of the union anymore.</p>

        <p>Modern republicans are a part of the same club and are allowing this shit to happen. The fact that none of them really stood up to the election fraud and 10 of them even voted to impeach Trump, shows you that they are all in the same club. They act as though they argue and fight for us people but they are all the same soulless bastards.</p>

        <p>And what happened under FDRs term? The intentional ignoring of intel of an attack on Pearl Harbor so the US would join WW2 and the creation of the new American empire.</p>
<p>FDR also heavily slowed the economic recovery pre WW2 due to his policies.</p>
<p>America practically became a different country under FDR, the only reason the 50s and 60s were so prosperous was because so much of the rest of the first world was destroyed so the US has a massive upper hand.</p>

        <p>The Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy is a fringe conspiracy that got popularized because of Batman The Dark Knight Returns but has no actual basis in history. </p>
<p>FDR inherited the Great Depression and an agricultural situation that led to the dust bowl. His policies weren't as helpful when compared to joining the war but they certainly weren't slowing economic recovery either. </p>
<p>&rt; America practically became a different country under FDR, </p>
<p>There was a war on. WWII demonstrated that technology was the name of the game for the future and so every country in the world began unprecedented investment and development of science and technology. The US not taking too much damage helped but so did things like the GI bill allowing for an unprecedented number of people to get college level education.</p>

        <p>Ruined our economy; enacted many quasi-socialist/communist programs, a lot of which we've never gotten rid of; put Japanese American citizens in concentration camps; and consolidated a lot of power into the executive branch that it's never released.</p>

        <p>You don’t understand what communism is if you think any of FDR’s plans were communist. As for socialism literally all of his rules about industry got reversed after the war ended and the right to co opt industry was well established from previous wars.</p>

        <p>Real question... where CAN you flee to? Every “free” country is being overwhelmed with all this bullshit. Is it time to move to some third world country and be poor if it means being left alone by the government?</p>
<p>Like, I live in Canada, I never thought we would lose so much freedom so fast. I REALLY never thought America would. Where is there to go?</p>
