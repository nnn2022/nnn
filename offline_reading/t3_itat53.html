    <strong>Delingpole: Boris Johnson Has Led a Fascist Coup Against the United Kingdom</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/09/10/boris-johnson-has-led-a-fascist-coup-against-the-united-kingdom/">https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/09/10/boris-johnson-has-led-a-fascist-coup-against-the-united-kingdom/</a></p>
<p>“Boris Johnson has led a fascist coup against the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>If that sounds like an exaggeration, just ask yourself how you’d have felt a year ago — or even six months ago — if you’d been told a British government was planning to institute a 10pm curfew, ban gatherings of more than six people, impose daily immunity tests before you were allowed to go about your business, employ Stasi-like volunteer ‘marshals’ to ensure public compliance and warning that it might even have to cancel Christmas?</p>
<p>Your first reaction would have been: “Impossible. This is the kind of thing that excitable foreigners engage in. Never the phlegmatic, rational British – and certainly, never, ever, EVER so long as there’s a Conservative government in power.</p>
<p>Your second reaction would have been: “Oh, I get it. It’s a joke, right? You’re telling me the plotline of some new dystopian graphic novel on the lines of <em>Watchmen</em> currently being adapted for Amazon Prime or Netflix, yeah?”</p>
<p>I still can’t quite believe it myself.”</p></p>

<p>As the U.K. Column points out, this is of course not Johnson (don’t call him Boris - it humanises him) but the forces who control the U.K. government. A coup, nonetheless. And what better time in recent history?</p>
<p>A reminder of the words of Camus:</p>
<p>"The welfare of the people…has always been the alibi of tyrants…giving the servants of tyranny a good conscience."</p>
