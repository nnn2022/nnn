        <p>In France when I was a kid (early 00's) there was an add that would come on TV EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY around lunch time.</p>
<p>It was some short cool cartoon that would say ''Les produits laitiers sont nos amis pour la vie'', it translates to ''Dairy products are our friends for life !'</p>
<p>It was sponsored by the ministry of health, I still have the jingle and these words stuck in my head almost 20 years later, they ran this slogan for years.</p>

        <p>It's distressing to think about really. So much of our society is built on trust, and the belief that someone's selfishness is your own best interest. But if you think too hard about it, all of that is clearly bullshit - every scientist has a boss and is trying to put food on the table, every business has people within warning them to do things better (less cheaply) or there may be consequences. </p>
<p>The only choice left, is you have to stick to your own opinions, morals, and your own standards for trusting someone else. Right now, governments and scientists are doing nothing to earn our trust. They could do many things, be more transparent, have honest conversations about ethics, but they aren't. They are resorting to arguing from a place of authority, and they have a god complex. It's partly the way society has been built over the past few years (excessive litigation, cancel culture), but it is also partly a lack of conscience and responsibility on the part of the people in charge at this moment.</p>

        <p>I wonder how we found out that those scientists were corrupt im sure it was all found out by randos on the internet and not other scientific who counter-argumented and discredited what those corrupt scientists said! Because if one thing is clear its that if i dont understand how something work its definatly rigged against me!</p>

        <p>But how long did it take? Was it a week after, a month, a year? No it was decades and only when enough people finally noticed the links between the behaviour and the health consequences and took it seriously that the recommendations changed. And even now after everyone knows that these things once called healthy actually aren't the conditioning runs so deep that a lot people behaviours haven't changed. But with all the historical evidence that you should consider these things over the long term rather than the short term. Even though some doctors and medical experts are already voicing concerns. We're not even 2 years into this "pandemic", and we're changing our entire behaviour, our health practises and lining billions of people up for vaccines which haven't even had the time to be thoroughly tested, and yet you believe that people questioning whether this is really a good idea are unscientific. You're right about one thing, the system is definitely rigged against you.</p>

        <p>Look the date of the first articles criticising those experts it wasn't decade after merely a year or so which is quite fast for publishing in a peer reviewed journal which most of the pseudo expert that were corrupted didnt do. The decade after that youre reffering to was to build up the trials.</p>

        <p>I love how the mods are deleting the posts under this thread.</p>
<p>The people who pushed the lies were the executives and CEOs of those companies.</p>
<p>A scientists research into benefits of smoking needs to be balanced with the whole picture.</p>
<p>Does nicotine have benefits. Sure. Do those benefits outweigh the disadvantages of smoking, no.</p>
<p>But the cigarette executives took that research and through a combination of money, threats and acts of omissions ensured that all of the dissenting voices were drowned out.</p>
<p>Above all it was good science that showed the truth of smoking and how harmful it was.</p>
<p>Not conspiracy forums built by propagandists to create misinformation and confusion.</p>

        <p>Prevalently? Specific proof in multiple cases?

        <p>Except that there is good science and bad science.  Science is a method of discovery.  Some people lie, others are bad at it, some are paid to doctor studies, etc.  Incidentally, the scientific method is extremely new in human history.  People in the past just experimented and got results occasionally.</p>

        <p>I agree with you there but the scientific method has been around since the Enlightenment, which was when the world began to take off technologically. So yes it is relatively new in our entire history but so is the rate of new technology which is due to the scientific method</p>

<p>Idk what ice age you’re talking about, but even in the 60’s and 70’s people were aware of the effects of greenhouse gases on our atmosphere and climate. Oil &amp; Gas companies spent a ton of money covering it up. But I guess scientists in those industries would never lie, right? Only the baddies making vaccines!</p>
