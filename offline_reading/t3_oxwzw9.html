    <strong>Why though?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m really trying to figure out why is it that, I’ve not changed literally ANYTHING about how I go about my day, from general hygiene, to hand washing, to wearing a mask (which I haven’t). I don’t really use hand sanitizer and I haven’t been social distancing, not even a little. </p>
<p>So I need to know, if I’m breaking all of the rules that go along with being safe from covid, why haven’t I had one symptom? I’ve even been around people that have “tested positive” for it, and nothing. No one has an answer for this. And I’m case you ask, I don’t have the antibody count. This covid shit is a joke.</p></p>

        <p>I mean this is pretty anecdotal and isn’t going to get you anywhere in a discussion with a doomer. However, I believe this is how it should be for everyone. People should just live their lives. How is that even a debate anymore. If you want to live your life in fear and get shots for the rest of your life, wear a useless face diaper forever, and listen to daddy government to tell you how to live, then go for it. But leave everyone else alone.</p>

        <p>I definitly agree that this is anecdotal, but I’ve talked to so many people with the same experience, and it just baffles me that people are still buying this shit, even the pro vaxxers that never got sick.</p>

        <p>It could be you've always been that type of person.  Always played outside,  got your hands dirty,  swam in lakes and rivers etc.  I was like that and still am.  I never get sick and don't really pay attention to all this hyper hygiene. </p>
<p>My wife was never allowed to go out and play when she was little.   She always gets sick.</p>

        <p>A dude in Canada went to court over a fine for violating covid restrictions and, as part of his discovery, demanded that the province supply an isolated sample of covid.</p>
<p>They dropped the case immediately opened up the restrictions and said "were treating covid like the flu now"</p>
<p>Covid doesn't exist outside of paperwork and media talking heads.</p>

        <p>Same with me. I wish they would be honest about the asymptomatic rate. At the beginning it was 80% asymptomatic. Now it's 100% you end up on a ventilator lol</p>

        <p>It’s like peanuts; for most people they’re harmless and aren’t anything to concern yourself about. However for some people they’re deadly as they trigger a massive reaction/Auto immune response. Now as you can’t easy catch peanuts from other people you don’t have to worry whether you’d be susceptible to them. But COVID is either harmless in that it doesn’t cause a response or it can fuck you up. But they don’t know which group you’re going to be in. But if you’re in the group that could get poorly and you’re old, unwell or unfit then it can really fuck you yup. So you’re probably in the peanut eating group and will be fine no matter what you do but the panic is because you might give peanuts to someone who’ll get ill. So they’re all trying to come up with daft ways to stop anyone getting ill. However as these methods are causing more harm than good they’ll eventually let those who will succumb to peanuts die off as they’ve done with other bar snacks.</p>
