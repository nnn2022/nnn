        <p>Mclean is such a trojan horse. She campaigned as a moderate democrat, then after election came out with all these far-left extremist views. She's pushing climate change propaganda in a state where you can legally conceal carry and open carry an AK into the statehouse. We are as red as Texas. She thinks electric cars are going to save the environment and wants to make them mandatory. I'd like to send her to a cobalt mine in the Congo to mine with all the children and see what she thinks then. Also the number of classic car enthuthiasts in this state is rediculous.</p>
<p>Her little "woke" followers are severely outnumbered. The only thing they got going for them is too many of us are too busy working hard and paying bills to spend all day obsessing over this shit. But if they keep fucking with our freedoms the silent majority is going to bite back.</p>

        <p>Let's agree to disagree, the state is red, just a majority that are right leaning here are kind of apolitical or just too distracted with real life; or if they do care they're sucked into Fox News which is fake and controlled.</p>
<p>edit: voter turnout was 64% for Trump. Republican wins across the board. The only dem with power here is the whack ass mayor of Boise.</p>

        <p>Lol...the only blue are the college Marxists who don’t work and haven’t owned anything yet and the transplants moving in.  The state is very very red and very heavily armed.  We have friends who live in Boise and some smaller towns and the amount of Huns being sold is absolutely insane right now and has been for months.</p>

<p>3 people on her sidewalk(public property). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq_u14FlYzM and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEvzY-L_18Y This was bad acting. One of the other board members even tried to call it out as it was happening. You wouldn't know that if you watched mainstream news, or followed the board member https://twitter.com/Lachiondo4Ada . </p>
<p>Something very dark is going on there, chief of police is a transplant from Portland, mayor is not who she claims to be.</p>
<p>They are pushing masks and 5G incredibly hard, arresting people for not wearing mask. Someone else mentioned "electric cars" well, check this out: https://idahofreedom.org/dark-money-not-philanthropy-how-boises-mayor-fooled-the-press-about-her-job/ Follow the money: https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/iconiq-capital-invests-in-truckstopcom-at-1b-valuation (Her husband's employer)</p>
<p>Hate to say it, but a federal investigation may be in order for them. County sheriff is completely ignoring the situation. State police are in corrupt governor's back pocket.

        <p>“They would’ve required masks only in certain situations and allowed restaurants and bars to remain open.”</p>
<p>They should know now that any requirement outside of hospitals or similar settings (which likely already have requirements) is one too many. </p>
<p>Also why do they refer to the protesters as “anti-maskers”? Just because they aren’t convinced of “experts” opinions of masks? Why can’t they just refer to them as citizens protesting against potential mask mandates instead.</p>
