<title>Just a few questions. Why are you guys against masks? What do you think people have to gain in lying that they are helpful? Same question with vaccines? Why do you think 95% of medical officials and the like are lying to you? Just curious</title>

        <p>I mean to be fair I do disagree with your views and I do think it is rather selfish with not wearing masks due to the very little impact it has on your life and the fact it could help save others. I mean even if there is a small chance you guys might be wrong why risk it and not just wear a mask Incase.</p>

        <p>No there is not a small chance. Humoring you, if there was a small chance it would be so cery mich smaller than all the other ways that you are killing people it really makes me question your morals. That small chance would also be greatly outweighed by the harms</p>

        <p>Let me draw an analogy.
So I'm a vegetarian and I'm not obese. I'm a very low burden on the public health system.</p>
<p>Since I'm going above and beyond to keep healthcare costs low, but I pay the same taxes as people who don't take care of themselves, should I advocate that the government ban meat sales in restaurants? What about an exercise mandate? Should the government require you to exercise for an hour a day? As a fit person, I find an hour of exercise to be a very light burden, lighter than constant mask usage.</p>
<p>I want to make my own decisions about risk and health. Even if they are bad ones. "My body, my choice" I've had too many bad encounters with doctors and hospitals and the wacky operations they try to pull just to get paid. So I don't blindly trust them.</p>

        <p>Masks = they don’t work in filtering viruses. They are also a powerful symbol of compliance.</p>
<p>Governments have an agenda. Look into the Great Reset. Look at the parallels with totalitarianist societies with what has happened this last year+. I recommend “Live Not by Lies” by Rob Dreher</p>

        <p>Masks dont work, people however are free to wear whatever clothing they feel comfortable in. Where do you get the 95%? The medical professional I know dont think they should be required and dont think they are useful, its media doctors who do.  I dont know or respect TV people, I'll stick to opinions of people who have hands on experience and I know are real professionals. </p>
<p>People dont always lie, sometimes they are misinformed or have personal feeling that lead them to believe what they are saying. True liers have a variety of motives, I think you might be better off reading just a bit of psychology if you want help understanding that area. </p>
<p>Every doctor I know didnt take the vax, enough said. The group that took it the most is the general public, then a perecnt of nurses/HCW and zero Drs. My mind is made up.</p>

<p>They're not helpful, and utterly useless. </p>

<p>It's about compliance and my failure to comply is what bothers people like you the most. </p>
<p>&rt;Why do you think 95% of medical officials and the like are lying to you?</p>
<p>Lying? Maybe. The fact is they don't fucking know the mid and long term effects of a treatment rolled out in mere months. Vaccines take years to develop and test. The fastest vaccine in history was created in four years. This one, in months. </p>

        <p>Thousands of statements and studies make the point that masks do work. It’s not compliance that annoys people like me what so ever. It’s the fact that you are endangering others with selfish behavior. Also the vaccine has been worked on for a longer time than most people think. We didn’t start from scratch when covid came about we had a baseline that was worked upon based on other viruses for years before</p>

        <p>Well restaurants have been pushed to have atleast some kind of opening as to try and ease the harm done to them because of covid right? That’s why restaurants are open and you can’t exactly wear a mask while eating food. I know I’m going to get downvoted but tbh I would rather restaurants still be restricted to outdoor dining atleast as much as possible until a few months from now.</p>

        <p>"Outdoor mask mandates might also turn people off from obeying better rules. “Given the very low risk of transmission outdoors, I think outdoor mask use, from a public-health perspective, seems arbitrary,” Muge Cevik, an infectious-disease and virology expert at the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, told The Washington Post. “I think it affects the public’s trust and willingness to engage in much higher-yield interventions. We want people to be much more vigilant in indoor spaces.”</p>
<p>Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School, spoke with several male mask skeptics last year for a piece in The Atlantic. When she explained that masking wasn’t as important outdoors, the men became more amenable to wearing them indoors. By connecting rules to reasons, she got them to see the value of covering their nose and mouth when it actually mattered. Last week, Marcus told me that she’s baffled by the notion that the best way to get people to wear masks inside is to mandate that everybody wear one when they’re alone outside. “We don’t recommend condom use when people are enjoying themselves alone to get them to wear condoms with their sexual partners,” she said."</p>
<p>"Masks send all sorts of messages to all sorts of different people. To some, they’re beacons of safety; to others, they’re signs of imperious government overreach. As Marcus argued, mandating a public-health tool that’s not needed can drive away people who might otherwise be on board with more important interventions. “I think there’s a proportion of the population that believes restrictions will last indefinitely,” Marcus said, “and they are probably one of the hardest groups to keep engaged in public-health efforts.”</p>
<p>Finally, mandating outdoor masks and closing public areas makes a show of "taking the virus seriously" while doing nothing to reduce indoor spread, in a way that often hurts the less fortunate. To deal with its COVID-19 spike, for example, the Canadian province of Ontario instituted a stay-at-home order and closed many parks and playgrounds. “These policies are made by people who have yards,” Marcus said. “If you live in an apartment building and have no yard, and are required to wear masks at all times outdoors, you never get to be maskless outside. And then, where do people gather maskless to socialize? Inside their homes”—where the risk of transmission is higher."</p>

        <p>Well they shouldn’t rally be gathering to begin with. Social needs can be met atleast partially online and even if you’re outside if you are standing close to the other person there is still a decent chance of spreading it. Maybe not incredibly high but the risk is still there</p>

        <p>Evidence now says there wouldn't be, measures didn't achieve anything, some countries did nothing, no excess deaths, some did things stopped, no excess deaths. Aside from that deaths were inevitable and accepted, measures were to stop healthcare systems being overrun, which with a years' evidence now they never were, not due to measures, the numbers of hospitalizations just dropped rapidly last year.</p>
<p>They predicted huge death rates,  and before measures were even introduced those rates never emerged, measures and rules just kept, and still keep spiralling upwards without any reason.</p>
