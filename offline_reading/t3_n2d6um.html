    <strong>Now that the narrative is collapsing, Covidiots are becoming hysterical</strong>
    <p><p>I relocated from NYC to Miami to get away from these fucking insane, castrated, completely brainwashed morons that wear masks outside. While it is admittedly MUCH, MUCH better here, I’ve noticed in the last week that as the narrative collapses, the pushiest Covidiots that want to control others are becoming mouthier and more pushy. Has anyone else noticed this? In the past week alone, I was refuse service for not wearing a mask inside a convenience store - I told the guy to fuck off and left. Another time, a guy asked me to take a different elevator because I “sneezed outside” before coming into a building. He said it’s just to “be safe” and how we “all have to do what we can” and I said “I don’t care, it’s been over a year, there’s a vaccine out, if you’re scared, YOU stay home.” Ive been trying really hard to continue to shut these people down, but at a certain point it does get exhausting. </p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed that they’ve been more brazen lately? It seems like AS the narrative collapses - everyone else knows it is - they get louder.</p></p>

        <p>Oh yes. I recently heard a story about some family who traveled to Hawaii, their 10 or 11 year old kid "died of covid" within 24 hours of landing.</p>
<p>Cue "need" for another rushed "vaccine" this time for children.</p>

        <p>What they're not telling you about that story is that both parents had recently been injected with the devil juice.  The kid probably got a mutant strain that had leaked from his parents.</p>

        <p>There was a story on the Canadian news for one day about how some girl who tested negative twice died, but the testing negative thing was included in small print and the fact that she'd been exposed to COVID-19 was included in larger print. I noticed that it disappeared after one day, so I think too many people yelled at the news station. People were laughing at it as propaganda over on Twitter. I mean, it sucks that the girl died, but be honest about what she died of and don't try to make people think it's COVID for your own sick satisfaction!</p>

        <p>And the media. Constantly describing people as “maskless”, ie “a maskless man entered a store...” or “antimasker”. I’m reading it and thinking - really? A “maskless” man? So you mean a man. A normal man. It’s so strange how they’re pushing this, very Orwellian approach to language, like any other time we would describe someone as MASKED being the weird thing. And the way people “film” people without masks on like we are the weird ones - it makes me want to start walking up to anyone wearing a mask, and start filming them. “Look at this crazy fucking person walking around with a mask on their face for over a year because CNN and Fauci told them to”</p>

        <p>To be frank, it's an insult to Branch Davidians to be compared to Corona's Witnesses.  They were actually kind of cool for a cult.  If you dig into it, it looks kind of like the .gov shut them down because they might have been on to something.</p>

And for emphasis, Janet Reno, the Attorney General, sent a bunch of psycho cop wannabes and lit American citizens up and killed them with fire.  How do I know this you might ask?  I know because I watched it on TV, live, with rest of America.  Fucking Bill Clinton and Janet Reno, fuck them.</p>

        <p>I walked around a very crowded garden center yesterday afternoon and was one of three men not wearing masks.</p>
<p>Most were old ladies and men who looked very sissified.  No one said a word to me though, and I didnt buy anything and just walked the aisles.  It looked nice, but prices were high. </p>
<p>You have to show your face.  Don't apologize.  When you see other people without masks thank them for it.</p>

I did a few times toward the beginning just as a genuine reaction, and was met each and every time with "oh I just forgot it I usually wear it though!!" Or some variation of that... "well ok then.

        <p>there is a split happening among the people: </p>
<p>those who are possessed by the parasitic consciousness will become extreme in their expression of darkness (because they react to this change with going in the opposite direction out of fear) and those who found the light in themselves (consciously or not) are becoming ever more awake, truthful and loving.</p>
<p>until the final breakthrough and the complete collapse of the moder slave-matrix, this split will only increase. </p>

        <p>Do you even hear yourself? If masks and vaccines work so well, you should be able to get total, complete protection for yourself by making use of both, yourself, and not have to worry about others.</p>
<p>When people got the flu shot before, they assumed they were protected from the flu, and didn't care what "morons" wanted to go get sick. They covered their ass in what ways they saw fit, nd the same is true today in terms of what measures you can take to protect yourself (or not). </p>

        <p>yes that's true but vaccines have only become widely available (in the US) in th last few months. before that, masks and social distancing was the only protection. yes masks work, are they 100%? no, but they are very effective. but when one person isn't wearing a mask around someone who is, that's not being safe because the mask is only partially effective. https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/coronavirus-is-not-canceled-wear-your-mask take a look at this chart and article, do some real research and maybe you'll realize you're wrong.</p>

        <p>Masks have never been proven to be in any way effective at curbing the spread of airborne disease in the real world.</p>
<p>Edit: furthermore, you said it yourself. Vaccines have been available for MONTHS and for quite some time now there have been plenty of open appointments or even walk-in locations. Stop living in the past. We aren't talking about last year, we're talking about what can and should be done (or not) now.</p>

        <p>the CDC article has no mention of COVID, just influenza. Now incase you haven't noticed, influenza and covid are different, meaning masks work in different ways. Also, that was published in July 2020, since then lots of research has been done. I want you to show me on specifically the CDC website, where it says that masks are ineffective at stopping the spread of covid, anything else isn't reliable or proof of anything.</p>

        <p>The CDC classifies COVID as an "influenza-like illness," and furthermore, everything I've read has suggested that if anything, COVID is MORE easily spread/more contagious than influenza. So it would follow that if masks do nothing to stop the spread of influenza, they would most likely do even less to stop the spread of a more-easily-spread influenza-like illness.</p>
<p>Might want to check out the citations in <a href="https://www.primarydoctor.org/masks-not-effect">this</a> article, from the section about "leakage jets" (citations 8 and 9 from the article). Even IF face masks block up to 50% of forward traveling COVID (which is a generous estimate based on the aerosol size of COVID itself and what we know about how similarly sized particles behave with face masks), the effect would be negated by the jets to the side and behind the person, traveling "several meters."</p>

        <p>Did you look at the links I provided even? There are citations for studies showing various types of masks don't work to varying degrees. Even N95 masks are worthless, seeing as how they are a) not even CLOSE to full protection when worn properly and b) nearly everyone wears them improperly (even trained professionals) if putting them on themselves without someone else helping fit it.</p>
<p>There are other citations in there to other studies proving surgical masks and cloth masks are both absolutely worthless.</p>
<p>I'm not going to keep having a discussion if you're unwilling to look at metadata from two decades of combined studies, and links to the CDC itself (after you asked for it and I went out and did your research for you in a matter of seconds). If you are that unwilling to look at scientific evidence, there's no point in bringing science into the discussion.</p>

        <p>Speaking of your ignorance: </p>
<p>https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>
<p>&rt;* A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A large randomized controlled trial with close to 8000 participants, published in October 2020 in PLOS One, found that face masks “did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.” <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240287">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A February 2021 review by the European CDC found no significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of non-medical and medical face masks in the community. Furthermore, the European CDC advised against the use of FFP2/N95 respirators by the general public. <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A November 2020 Cochrane review found that face masks did not reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;<em> A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were </em><em>penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use.</em>* <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591">Source</a></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>The WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 <a href="https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/">mask policy update</a> was due not to new evidence but <a href="https://archive.ph/YVJ0Y">“political lobbying”</a></strong>: “We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (D. Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent).</p>
<p>&rt;    * There is increasing evidence that the novel coronavirus is transmitted, at least in indoor settings, not only by droplets but also by smaller aerosols. However, due to their large pore size and poor fit, cloth masks cannot filter out aerosols (see <a href="https://videopress.com/v/4egEyh2b">video analysis</a>): <strong>over 90% of aerosols <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">penetrate or bypass</a> the mask and fill a medium-sized room within minutes.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;    * During the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/">made no difference</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;    * To date, the <strong>only randomized controlled trial (RCT) on face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting found no statistically significant benefit</strong> (see above). However, three major journals <a href="https://swprs.org/the-suppressed-danish-mask-study/">refused to publish</a> this study, delaying its publication by several months.</p>
<p>&rt;    * An analysis by the US CDC found that <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4">85% of people</a> infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always” (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%)</strong>. Compared to the control group of uninfected people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>German researchers found that even an N95/FFP2 mask mandate had <a href="https://twitter.com/DaFeid/status/1371448332875399168">no influence</a> on the coronavirus infection rate.</strong> Austrian researchers found that the introduction, retraction and re-introduction of a facemask mandate in Austria had no influence on the infection rate. </p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>In the US state of Kansas, the 90 counties without mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates</strong> than the 15 counties with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/more-deception-kdhe-hid-data-to-justify-mask-mandate/">tried to manipulate</a> the official statistics and data presentation.</p>
<p>&rt;    * Contrary to common belief, studies in hospitals <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">found that</a> the wearing of a medical mask by surgeons during operations <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493952/pdf/annrcse01509-0009.pdf">didn’t reduce</a> post-operative bacterial wound infections in patients.</p>
<p>&rt;    * German scientists found that in and on <strong>N95 (FFP2) masks</strong>, the novel coronavirus remains infectious for <a href="https://fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/forschung/forschungsprojekte/moeglichkeiten-und-grenzen-der-eigenverantwortlichen-wiederverwendung-von-ffp2-masken-im-privatgebrauch/index.php">several days</a>, <strong>much longer than on most other materials</strong>, thus <strong>significantly increasing the risk of infection</strong> by touching or reusing such masks.</p>

        <p>&rt;Also, that was published in July 2020, since then lots of research has been done. I want you to show me on specifically the CDC website, where it says that masks are ineffective at stopping the spread of covid, anything else isn't reliable or proof of anything.</p>

        <p>Exactly. First the dude asks for "source." When peer reviewed studies and medical journals, with a dash of NIH and CDC thrown in isn't enough, dude then comes back with "I want an answer to this VERY SPECIFIC question from SPECIFICALLY the CDC website."</p>
<p>I'm guessing bonus points if the CDC link is from within the last 2 months? After all, the newest science that flies directly in the face of scientific consensus up to that point is always the REAL science, right?</p>

        <p>In a roundabout way, yes. They've just buried the information and studies done prior to 2020 (before there was an incentive for scientists to come up with different results/conclusions). So they literally contradict themselves by saying all they do on their front page about masks being soooo effective, while still leaving up all the studies proving otherwise.</p>
<p>I genuinely don't know why they haven't scrubbed all those studies from the past 20 years from their site at this point.</p>

        <p>so you are saying you are going to wear a mask forever? I don't care about being completely safe, you do you. I'll be going out to gay bars this summer, meeting people, rooftops etc. I'm ready for fun. I didn't go to a bar all last summer and I've been working out I'm ready. this virus isn't going away. most people will resume normal life without masks. the cdc already said vaccinated people can gather unmasked indoors so why aren't you following the science?</p>

        <p>None of this is even fucking relevant. If you weren’t such a wimp, you wouldn’t be so scared (wear masks take a vaccine!) About something that is the equivalent of the flu for MOST people. I’m not altering my entire life because of something that is lethal to 80 year olds with co-morbidities. Get a grip on reality and maybe actually listen to what other people are saying.</p>

        <p>Yes I have noticed this. It’s because these loser doomers know their time in the sun (figuratively speaking, because doomers barely leave the basement) is coming to an end.</p>
<p>I’ve ALSO noticed that people are much nicer to me when I don’t wear a mask. In the past week: I’ve gotten two compliments from grocery store employees on my dress, a man walking down the same aisle as me smiled and said good afternoon, a toddler waved HI!! excitedly to me as I rode my bike past him and his family. I really think people want to see smiling faces.</p>

        <p>The thing is, the type of person who wants to keep wearing a mask probably hates getting unsolicited compliments, or strangers smiling and talking to them. But even if they did, to them no quality of life improvement is worth it, they’d rather be gloomy and miserable than do anything even remotely something “unsafe”</p>

<p>It's not an insult though, it's a bit above average. That's what I honestly think. Some of these people take hours writing posts to debunk me with information they find on the web.

        <p>Our local health dept has switched from reporting a count of cases as a number to counting as a percapita, just like that our county of 48000 just looked like the cases doubled when they report it per 100k 
This was on their Facebook page I asked why the switch but no response.<br>
Made a comment for people to read the data as a whole not just look at the numbers. Same situation as died with covid vs died of covid in the beginning</p>

        <p>Yes. Yesterday a small group of my friends were standing on a sidewalk after eating breakfast at a local restaurant. A woman comes walking down the sidewalk toward us, double masked. We all step off the sidewalk, and out of her way so she can pass but she still just stands there glaring at us. One friend asks if she's trying to get into the car we are next to, because why else would she just be standing there? She proceeds to yell at us that she just needs to get past but can't because we aren't wearing masks... </p>
<p>I've noticed as well that even when CDC releases new guidelines (like masks are unnecessary outside) these people are so addicted to the fear they cling on to the strictest guidance and are angry others aren't doing the same</p>

        <p>I was just in south Florida for a trip.  Libtards and their masking outdoors baffled me.  You are correct - mainly people who’ve recently migrated to get away from NY and elsewhere, but bringing their whole agenda to impose on everyone else.  Businesses, too.  It was truly unbelievable to experience at this stage in the game.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed this and NGL I have a fun time egging them on to see how far they will go. Another customer in Home Depot walked up to me (It was just me and one other person 15 feet away in the isle), she went out of her way to come down the isle and berate me about not wearing a mask. She also got very close to me while I calmly picked up a product off the shelf and said “please stay 6 feet away in accordance with social distancing guidelines, I’ll not put on a mask and I’ll leave the store as soon as I make my purchase”. At which point she stormed away threatening to tell a store manager. The other gentleman in the isle walked up to me, took his mask off, placed it in his pocket and said “what a psycho”. I checked out and on my way out got to see the crazy woman berating the store manager for allowing people in the store without a mask. </p>
<p>I don’t understand the mentality of a person like that and boy is it fun to set them off.</p>

You can refuse service as long as you are not discriminating based on gender, race, LGBT, disability, etc. (characteristics outlined by the constitution and the laws).

        <p>Yeah, if Jews are okay they just have to wear a fabric yellow star on their clothes.  Look at history to see what happens when you change a person's identity to something other than human.</p>
<p>Oh, and proven non-N95 masks don't prevent the spread of airborne diseases like Covid and measles.  Dirty underwear on your face saves zero lives.  So, it's wear a mask and erase your identity to save no lives, or live free.  I know what I choose, and we know what you choose.</p>

        <p>No, it isn't that simple. Regardless of covid being fake (which not a lot of people actually think, no matter how hard anyone may try to put us all in that box), there's then the question of whether they're effective enough to save a significant number of lives. If they are, that'd be great, but in comparing deaths and cases in places with and without mask mandates (like Florida and California for example) it's looking unlikely that they're making a significant difference. And if they aren't, mask mandates aren't painless. If they aren't, the social and environmental consequences of the mandate are being pushed onto us for no reason or benefit. The divide, the hostility, even violence, the idea that you can tell a stranger what they must wear for you without knowing their circumstances, and overall how these mandates have affected how we treat each other. As well as this, there's the sheer volume of disposable masks ending up in the ocean. Banning plastic straws or whatever makes no difference if you've got billions of people chucking out their one-use plastic masks which mostly end up in the oceans adding to an already serious pollution problem. I thought people cared about that stuff, or is that only when there isn't something else more trendy to post about? My point is, this rule has consequences and it is unethical to force an invasive policy on people without abundant evidence that not only does it work, but that it is effective enough to justify those consequences. What we have right now is not abundant evidence, it is conflicting, wishy-washy nonsense with evidence for and against mask mandates and our only <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">RCT study</a> inconclusive, and overall doesn't prove either side is right.</p>
