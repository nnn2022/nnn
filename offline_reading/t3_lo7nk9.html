    <strong>Has anybody taken a complete break from TV like me?</strong>
    <p><p>This goes without saying but i dont reallly like the news anyway but after waking up i made sure to avoid it and when i watch anything from the MSM these days i really do just see propaganda. </p>
<p>Its insane, i was right all along. </p>
<p>The elites have set up a soul matrix, we are taxed animals, they just want us to eat, shit and pay taxes. oh and take all their poisonous vaccines and dangerous chemotherapy. </p>
<p>Did you know cancer cells are just cells feeding on negativity, all systematic illness stems from stress and fear. The more stress and worried a soul is the more darkness it consumes and the more sins committed. </p>
<p>The matrix is crazy, i escaped last year and im doing everything in my power to raise awareness but the media is all fake or it is just propaganda. Its all actors, narratives, propaganda and selfish ideas. Look at adverts, self promotion. Everything in this world is made to destroy us, like the GAZER GAZER man said himself. </p>
<p>Why cant we shut this down, why is there so much evil in the world, its like the nazis are back in power. This has got to end, we need peace and love being spread on the "news" not gaslighting articles and useless stories. They just feed you this shit to keep you distracted from the real issues like the elite ruling class, 13 families in control on earth, human trafficking, war games, central banks, rothchilds, saturns cube, and a bunch of shady devil worshipping shit that i will not elaborate too much here but i can assure you it is all real. We only have to look at epstiens island and hilarys spirit cooking emails with marina abromovich. When will it end? i do my own thing, i live my life, in my world right now covid doesn't exist, stress free and care free. But its lonely and others need to do the same. (search up brotherhood of saturn if you want to explore that very real and dangerous rabbit hole) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What happened to independent thinking, why is everybody so obsessed with what bill and fauci say??? fuck them just go take a walk in the park, cook a meal, write a book, start a business, interact on social media, network. </p>
<p>We are in a global lockdown like caged animals? who has the authority to do this? its our planet, planet earth. nobody owns this planet apart from god himself so why are these devil worshipping elites calling the shots????</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. I haven’t had tv in a long time. This way I don’t zombie in front of it or even have it as background noise. Anything I truly want to watch I just stream.</p>

        <p>Same. I only actually purchased one new tv in my life, back in like 2008. My tv now is just a monitor for my Mac mini. I stream things like the news occasionally just to catch Tucker but movies and old tv shows live on a server and I can run Plex anywhere to watch that stuff. I still rarely do though.</p>

        <p>I watch Netflix very occasionally, but I haven't watched TV in over a year. It was weird watching my dad binge on netflix when he was visiting me, because watching his show was more important to him than taking to me. Nothing against him, we had a good visit, but TV (when it was on) was THE importance in the home.</p>

        <p>I haven’t watched the news since November. Local or otherwise. This is how I see the pandemic a farce. If it were not for masks and capacity limits and some things still being closed, I’d never know we were supposedly in one. I live in a still
Pretty restrictive state but people are out and moving. I’m not tripping over dead bodies. I do watch Netflix and watch anime and Japanese shows but I certainly do not miss watching the news.</p>

        <p>I've been taking a break since 2007 when I moved out of my parents house and decided not to get cable. I have been watching some old TV shows on Pluto TV but that's it. Actually if you do get a chance, watch some MacGyver... I never watched it before and it's pretty good.</p>

        <p>Yes. I'll check back in for 30sec of local news or CNN to see how bad it is and turn it off. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, even blocked or muted all of them from my social media feeds. If I need some disaster info I check their pages manually</p>

        <p>I don't remember the last time I watched news on TV. The only time I go to the local news channel online is when there's a snowstorm, and I just watch the clip of the weather.</p>
<p>I watch a handful of shows online. Currently watching Last Man Standing, which is normal because they fast forwarded past the pandemic (Tim Allen is one of the few open conservatives in Hollywood), and a little bit of reality TV shows, which are becoming increasingly toxic. CBS has said that, effective immediately, they will begin casting at least half minorities in their reality shows, which is not at all consistent with the demographics of the population. Who Is The Mole (Dutch) hasn't fallen for this trap yet and isn't really giving much attention to the pandemic, though they did get blasted by the woke mob because they had a split second that was called "racist" and had to pretend to apologize and are trying to scrub it from existence.</p>

        <p>Honestly mom and I had to drop the DirecTv last year because we couldn't afford it anymore. As far as the.v. shows go the only thing I really watch online is spot watching masked singer and masked dancer.</p>
<p>I doubt I'll watch S2 of dancer if there is one. It's not exactly bad, it's just not my thing. S5 of masked singer fires up next month and the U.k. version just wrapped up S2.</p>
