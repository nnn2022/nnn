    <strong>Seriously, you can't visit the grocery store or take a walk without millions of people being everywhere. I miss pre restrictions.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in the city. Before corona most places except the downtown was mostly half empty. grocery stores usually just had 2,5 people and the lines were rarely full. </p>
<p>Buses, Trains and streets also were somewhat fine.</p>
<p>Now, well grocery store is horrible. There is just so many people, long waits just to pay for your stuff. </p>
<p>Maybe there is something to countries or states taking this less serious having less cases, and that might be that people are much more spread out.</p>
<p>In summer most stuff was fully open expect festivals and converts, and the amount of infected were very few. And old people went into hiding because of that which might also have helped reduce the spread to the vulnerable.</p></p>

        <p>The 24 hour walmart is now open from 8am to 11 pm in my area. Which means, instead of shopping at 1 am when no one else is around, I have to shop at rush hour with 800 other people. Somehow this is safer, but the team of scientists I hired are at a loss to explain how.</p>

        <p>And doomers support this! There is actually a thread going on in a local FB about to get to the health dept to shut down Safeway because an idiot claims there were 2 registers open and 30 people in line which meant they were grouped together longer. If true, a legitimate complaint because the more registers they have open, the shorter the lines and the quicker people get out. But they want the store shut down as PUNISHMENT for not operating safely. They are too stupid to think this through. If Safeway shuts down, Safeway shoppers are forced to shop elsewhere which increases the crowds elsewhere. How does that make us any safer?</p>

        <p>Well ive heard their reasoning is it allows more time to sanitize the place.  But then they say the virus doesnt really spread by surface contact.</p>

        <p>Grocery stores are so much more crowded now and 10 months later they still can't reliably keep shit in stock. No 24 hour grocery, anywhere, probably ever again. I guess night shift people can just go fuck themselves.</p>

        <p>Moved to a small town during all this. There are only a few places to shop.</p>
<p>One of the things the governor is during is if too many people report they got sick on your business within a months time you get forced shutdown for two weeks no questions asked.  Walmart was one report away from being shutdown and put a ridiculous amount of measures in place to the point that there was a line to get in three hours long in forty degree weather.</p>
<p>The little store I work in became the go to to shop instead and ended making over double the money that it did that time last year. It was packed constantly and extremely stressful.</p>

        <p>Every time a lockdown is announced the parks and recreational areas are packed, any shops open packed, all I hear is the big supermarkets cooing over their massive profits then with the next breath begging people to stay away and only come for essentials, my arse it's the same as the betting company asking u to bet responsibly lmao what not at all u mean? Or shell oil company saying they are working hard to protect the planet and produce renewable fuels, these are the worst of the worst.... Or better yet the government that says they only care about your best interests ðŸ¤£</p>
