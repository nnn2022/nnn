        <p>So I googled germ theory and everything says it’s disproven pseudoscience. There’s even a 1968 Lancet article dedicated to refuting it. So, I’m not convinced on that.</p>

<li>
<p>Life expectancy was not as bad as they say in the past. Whenever I do genealogical research, I see people reaching 80+ centuries ago. They tell us we lived till 50. BS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Child-hood mortality is a big factor in this figures. If you take those numbers out, you're pretty much even with today. This is where the REAL improvements in healthcare have been made, perinatal care. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life expectancy got a hit during the industrial revolution, due to mining work, and general by effects of manual labor, and pollution during that time. Many of the "infectious diseases", such as small pox, were likely caused by polluting agents of the time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hygiene, electricity (refrigerators keeping our food fresh and less coal use at home), and plumbing have contributed to increase life-expectancy the most during the 20th century. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these things are completely ignored by the western medical system with its doctored textbooks: "it's the vaccines, yay!. But that's a lie. Viruses are exosomes/dead cell debris, they do not spread, do not cause disease (they are a symptom of disease, not cause), and which is not prevented by injections of poisonous materials we call vaccines.</p>

        <p>J&amp;J and AZ and Sputnik are all viral vector vaccines. Contrary to popular belief, they are even more invasive than mRNA vaccines, because they bring DNA into the cell nucleus. Yes, that's were your genome is as well. Who knows how long that foreign DNA stays there.</p>

        <p>Illness hits those who don’t eat properly. A healthy diet make the immune system strong. This is true for polio, and measles.. clean water and proper nutrition. I think measles is vitamin A.. and polio is feces in water. I can’t off the top of my head give you logic on I’m the other ones.. too early and I’m too tired. But I don’t Vaccinate.

        <p>Define "clean".  Is pool water clean and suitable for drinking? Because that's basically what's in the tap in modern cities. Sewage treatment underwent major law changes in the 70s which might have reduced pollutants in the water though.</p>
<p>I highly doubt small amounts of fecies is to blame for any disease, since a lot of animals instinctively are hungry for poop(dogs for example) which is usually undigested plant matter and bacteria(probiotic) without getting sick from it.</p>

        <p>As I said, I believe sewage laws might have been part of it. Like regulating where you can dump chemical waste.(now most of it goes into the ocean instead)</p>
<p>Insecticides are also a likely contributing factor, regulations regarding these also changed at about the same time as polio stopped being common.</p>
<p>This is just my ideas here, not gonna research this for your sake so if you are looking for alternative explanations go look on your own.(google censorship makes this information hard to come by)</p>

        <p>Well.. so there is also the suspicion that it wasn’t polio.. but DDT that was sprayed on people.. which was eventually banned. But poop in water isn’t hard to come by. These days heavy chemicals are used to “clean” water.</p>

        <p>Dude, I'm not saying they didn't. But considering that virtually everyone is being vaccinated, it's been going on for decades now, and yet polio still can infect enough people to survive, it's pretty clear that the entire concept of eradicating something with vaccinations is a pure fantasy. It only happened once out of how many programs?...</p>

        <p>No, smallpox was actually eradicated from vaccination. And it took decades I believe. Polio also became significantly less common thanks to the vaccine as well. The bottom line is that well-researched vaccines being used against actually deadly diseases is a good thing. But a rushed vaccine for a virus that only kills 1% of its hosts? Absolutely not.</p>

        <p>You will keep believing in the germ attacking you, until you do the research and see how they claim a lot, but never prove it, in a scientific manner. And there's all kinds of experiements that shows germ theory is not a correct model. Again, as I said above, look at Rosenau 1919. Look at how the scientific world is slowly discovering what exosomes are and how they work: exactly like "viruses". These scientists fail to understand they are the same thing, hampered by their medical schoolbooks based on Pasteur.</p>

        <p>"starts to eradicate"</p>
<p>So 57 years later we still have an effective measles vaccine and still haven't eradicated it yet.  Smallpox vaccines were still being given in the 60s,150 years in to that campaign. Not saying vaccines are bad, but virus eradication through vaccine is nigh on impossible. </p>
<p>But hey, I'm sure it will work with this one!</p>

        <p>And there is great value in disease reduction via vaccine, but OPs implied assertion was that eradication was the goal and that vaccines were or would be successful in achieving it.  I'm simply showing that historically, vaccine are not in any way a route to disease eradication.</p>

        <p>&rt;”In the <strong>great majority of cases</strong> the toll of the <strong>major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;”Similarly, for England and Wales <strong>John Powles shows that overall mortality declined</strong> over the last hundred years <strong>well in advance of specific immunizations and therapies.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/obituaries/rene-dubos-scientist-and-writer-dead.html">Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</a> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>”</p>
<p>&rt;”World renowned microbiologist, <strong>Professor Rene Dubos</strong> has acknowledged that the <strong>decline in mortality</strong> caused by infections <strong>“began almost a century ago</strong> and has continued ever since at a <strong>fairly constant rate irrespective of the use of any specific therapy.</strong> The effect of <strong>antibacterial drugs is but a ripple on the wave</strong> which has been wearing down the mortality caused by infection in our communities". ^2</p>
<p>&rt;Professor <strong>Dubos has further stated:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Modern Science’s role in defeating infectious diseases has been greatly exaggerated.</strong> Many of the most terrifying leprosy, plague, typhus, - had all but <strong>disappeared</strong> from Europe <strong>before serums, vaccines, and drugs</strong> were developed to combat them".  <strong>Ivan lilich in his book, Medical Nemesis, writes:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"The study and evolution of disease patterns provides evidence that during the last century <strong>doctors have affected such patterns no more profoundly than did priests during earlier times. Epidemics came and went, imprecated by both and untouched by either.</strong> They are not modified any more profoundly by the rituals performed in medical clinics than by the exorcisms customary at religious shrines.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The combined death rate from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles among children up to fifteen, shows that nearly 90 per cent of the total decline in mortality between 1860 and 1965 had occurred before the introduction of antibiotics and widespread immunization."</strong> (in reference to the UK).”</p>
<p>&rt;”<strong>George Bernard Shaw</strong>, the illustrious poet and also an ardent campaigner on public health issues, once stated: </p>
<p>&rt;"During the last considerable epidemic at the turn of the century, <strong>I was a member of the Health Committee of London Borough Council, and I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases (of smallpox) as postular eczema, varioloid or what not - except smallpox".</strong> ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“Many so-called "medical discoveries",</strong> however, have been <strong>announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;”Few back then grasped that these <strong>vaccines might also be a huge, inadvertent, uncontrolled experiment in interspecies viral transmission.</strong> But from <strong>1955 to 1963,</strong> according to a 1976 US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, <strong>98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40—a monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.”</strong> ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”By 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses. Such contamination often spoiled cultures, including those of an NIH researcher named <strong>Bernice Eddy,</strong> who worked on vaccine safety.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”As of 2003, SV40 had been found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that <strong>the rates of SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine</strong>, including the UK, USA, and Italy.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported</strong> on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that <strong>microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination.</strong> One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J.,</strong> who stressed that <strong>‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases</strong> including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease <strong>and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^5</p>
<p>&rt;##“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals</strong> pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the <strong>present measures used</strong> to check contagious diseases <strong>may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments</strong> used to check diseases, <strong>he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate</strong> that America may become a nation of invalids. <strong>Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young."</strong> (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^6</p>
<p>&rt;”Medical records prove that a <strong>90% decline</strong> in child mortality from scarlet fever, diptheria, whooping cough and measles occurred <strong>before the introduction of antibiotics and immunization,</strong> from 1860-1896. ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”I read what prominent men of science, medical officers for health, and doctors wrote about vaccination and its sequelae that never made it into today’s textbooks, and found out what anyone with even a passing acquaintance with disease figures of the 19th and 20th century knew. For example, by the 1950s when the whooping cough vaccine was introduced, data showed that whooping cough was killing only 1 percent of the numbers of people who used to die in England and Wales 50 years before. ^8</p>
<p>&rt;Official data showed that the same happened with measles. Indeed, <strong>when the measles vaccine was introduced to the UK in 1968, the death rate continued to drop steadily, even though the initial uptake of the vaccine was only 30 percent</strong> and didn’t get above 50 percent until the 1980s.”</p>
<p>&rt;”Doctors Kalokerinos and Dettman (Australasian Nurses Journal June 1981) point out: ^2</p>
<p>&rt;"A careful study of the decline in disease will show that up to 90% of the so called ‘killer diseases’ had all but disappeared when we introduced immunizations on a large scale during the late thirties and early forties. Since the introduction of routine immunizations we now have an ever alarming increase of degenerative diseases and maladies, but worse still the diseases we are supposed to be protected from still occur, probably in larger numbers than we might have expected them to, had we simply allowed the declining disease rate to continue".</p>

        <p>Shaw was involved with health causes and exposed the re-diagnosis racket early on. Dubos stated the truth too.  It’s an inconvenient truth for corrupt Big Pharma and captured agencies these days.</p>
<p>"The chief credit for the conquest of the destructive epidemics ... ought to have been given to the social reformers who had campaigned for purer water, better sewage disposal and improved living standards. It had been their efforts, rather than the achievement of the medical scientists, which had been chiefly responsible for the reduction in mortality from infectious disease".</p>

        <p>Well, your problem. Make it your priority to spend time on the truth. It's the only thing worthwhile in life. You're in IT, you have lots of time to read up during a coffee here and there. :)</p>
<p>Stop believing in all the experts, you need to start using simple logic in your life, and piece things together, or spot the irregularities. Use that brain. If germ theory would be right, then injecting blood/saliva of confirmed Spanish Flu patients would be making healthy volunteers sick, right? Nope, 0 out of a 100 got sick. ZERO. Same with Polio. They could not do it, transfer it to orphans/mental patients. Meaning: germ theory cannot be be reproduced, nor validated, only by faking it, through bought epidemiologists and virologists, and by adding assumption on assumption, they make us believe in the "invisible enemy". </p>
<p>Up to you start seeing there is no enemy to begin with.</p>

        <p>You don't understand how science works. </p>
<p>One elite guy who writes a new theory, his elite friends then reward this man with prizes for his great theory (typically the Nobel prize), and his theory gets written in all the medical text books, and all medical professionals will learn it as the undeniable truth. Anybody questioning or challenging this truth will be ridiculed, and all major journals will not publish such material, because the editors are also part of the same elite.</p>
<p>It's very easy to brainwash people, millions at the same time. Truth doesn't care about numbers, nor does it change if 99% has it wrong.</p>

        <p>All lying with statistics. Relabel causes of death. And the usual fakery. India has proven faked images of people lying in the street, for example.</p>
<p>The PCR test for Covid was made without any virus material (i did not understand this in february 2020 yet), so it cannot have been scientifically validated (tested against a virus sample), meaning all "positive" cases are just  a meaningless figure.</p>

        <p>These are misleading. My wife is a nurse and almost all nonessential treatments were cancelled during Covid spikes. Covid patients are very staff intensive. For example, ICU patients need to be turned over which requires 3 staff to do. You also need to segregate Covid from non-Covid patients to avoid cross contamination. I would guess Indian hospitals are similar.</p>

        <p>Looking at how the world functions today is often a good indication of how it's always worked. Therefore as ebola, aids, zikavirus, swine flu and corona were all created by vaccination/fear campaigns chances are so are most of the other pandemics throughout the years.</p>
<p>I can observe the world around me today and deduce that this is absolutely the case. Another easy tell is that wild animals unimpeded by humans don't have to worry about disease nearly as much as humans. </p>
<p>I have personally been able to get myself sick by eating some kinds of foods(seed oils are the worst) and cure such conditions by consuming high nutrient foods such as raw fermented meat or cheese. </p>
<p>This leads me to believe the reason people are sick most of the time is not because of some invisible(you can't see a virus optically) magic organism but because they simply put themselves in poor health by bad lifestyle choices such as eating McDonalds or spending 8 hours on the Phone a day.</p>
<p>There's also the obvious hints from major newspapers lately that most cases of polio is now caused by the polio vaccine.</p>
<p>(this was always the case. Dialectics: spread the thesis of a dangerous disease, make the antithesis not being "immune" to that disease, synthesis in vaccinations which gives "immunity". Of course the disease didn't exist as described in the first place but still caused enough worry for people to accept vaccinations.)</p>
