    <strong>Why have people not questioned the lockdown more?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure this question has been asked before, but I wanted to get your perspectives; why do you think some people are so okay with the lockdown? I have some friends who are normal social people; yet, it almost seems like the enjoy the lockdown - or at the very least feel like they're making some sort of sacrifice for health reasons. They're also well-aware that the news may be providing unrepresentative anecdotes. </p>
<p>I'm curious what you guys think the reasons for this are and why, even when people are negatively affected by the lockdowns, don't question it?</p></p>
