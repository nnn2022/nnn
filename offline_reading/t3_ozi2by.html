        <p>Why would they want to depopulate the planet and install this financial system if we’re going to be wiped out by this cataclysmic event?</p>

        <p>The magnetic field will shift at some point. But will it happen in 5 years, 500 years or 5000years? I dont think we can know this. However you say that is the reason for space race sounds not locigal to me. Even if the poles shift (which happened before), earth will still be the most habitable place in our solarsystem. So if you want to prepare for this its better to build some nice and bunkers that support life for a few years on its own.</p>
<p>The finance system looks like its running on lifesupport and covid messures asselerate that. Will it break down like a card house? Or can we outgrow it? I dont think a massive cyber blackout is needed to break the finance system, but it would asselerate the process. The big question is, will stuff like bitcoin be the future or will it be bsnned and as alternative we get a state controlled coin. I dont think a cyberattack is needed for that either. Just ban any decetralized currencies is enough.</p>
<p>However a cyberattack would be needed to get the control over the internet into the hands of a few.</p>

        <p>Sky made a brilliant show called COBRA which was shown 2 years ago. It was about a solar flare that took out the British power grid and caused riots and all sorts of problems. It showed how hard it would be to get a new power grid up and running. They showed massive power generators that had to made in the EU, which they couldn’t get straight away. Now I agree with the debt trapping us all, as I could get a credit card at 18 and also a 1000 pound loan as I’d worked for 2 years and it was with the same bank. I was terrible at paying things back but I got my credit score back up and then tanked it. I’ve now no debt, apart from an Eletric bill my neighbour causes due to stealing electricity from me. My overall point is that the internet wires and the cloud is under water, hence the satellite lunched into our orbit/ space isn’t real, the space bit is another topic but links into this one. When earth quakes happen on the sea bed and land starts to shift, then the normal internet will crash. They will use this to there advantage and bring in the debt forgiveness and put a chip under your arm from an injection. They’ve already trailed this in Sweden and a few other countries for a while. Tesla space internet will come on and you’ll own nothing. For people like me, with no debt, I’ll have freedom but not freedom of jobs and movement. I’ll have to live in the woods. I ain’t having the jab.</p>
