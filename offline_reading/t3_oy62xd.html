    <strong>Hey people from Australia what is going on in your personal lives dealing with the lock down?</strong>
    <p><p>Want to hear what is going on. From what I've seen you have military police and are not living how ANY person or even animal should live. Also how did you have your gun rights stripped from you? Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>One state has the Army supporting the police, they are not armed and have no real authority over the public at this stage. My state to the north is locked down, we have police check points set up doing RBT random breath checks for dui but the main goal is to ask why you are outside and fine you if not a valid reason.</p>
<p>Short story with gun rights, we gave them up after a mass shooting, most people in Oz hate guns and praise the policy to remove them from everyone. They hate them so much that the Prime Minister who implemented the policy is not well liked but praised for this. We can still have firearms they are just very regulated. Only legal why to own a handgun is to be part of a pistol club and can only use it there. </p>
<p>You absolutely can not use a firearm for self defence, in fact it is a crime to use any weapon in this country if it’s purpose is for self defence. As stupid as that sounds it’s true, eg you could have a cricket bat no drama if it’s only use is to play cricket, but if you only have that bat for self defence that is a crime.</p>

        <p>I was interested in your comment about self defense.  I am a Canadian and my understanding of Canadian law is it is also illegal to carry anything for self defense, HOWEVER should you happen upon something while being attacked such as a rock or if you took a weapon carried by the person assaulting you and used it for your defense that would be ok.  I don't get it.</p>

        <p>Yeah same principle here, like my example with the bat, if you use it to defend yourself it’s ok as long as it purpose was not to be a weapon. Tho saying that this country does not like people defending themselves, judging by the amount of people who do are changed.</p>

        <p>From what I can see a lot of us are fed up.
Been Quizing customers that have been coming in every day.
A good 90% of them are against this shit.
Everyone is angry and fed up with the lies and corruption.
People are ready to lash out when things go pear shaped.</p>
<p>Everyone is tired and worn.
They just want things to go back to normal.</p>

        <p>Reporting from Melbourne, Victoria. Our state is currently not in lockdown, built there is always a chance that there will be a “snap lockdown” over a minimal number of infections in the community.</p>
<p>Our state government has a rolling “state of emergency” that allows the implementation of government health orders legally. During this time there is minimal oversight in parliament and the government is able to continually renew the “state of emergency powers”</p>
<p>We had members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) patrolling and helping police officers enforce public health orders since the second lockdown here. Whilst it is somewhat unnerving that the ADF are in the streets, they’re not carrying weapons and generally are operating with the police force.</p>
<p>We are unable to plan our lives, because any plans made are generally met with lockdowns and the inability to leave the house legally.</p>
<p>Working has been difficult for those that are sole traders or small business owners (like myself) who aren’t “essential workers” as designated by the government. There has been minimal government support available for sole traders, however there has been multiple people earning more from the JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments than they did whilst working. This is creating an imbalance and making people less likely to want to go back to work as they are comfortable and earning for doing nothing. </p>
<p>Large companies and government agencies have been business as usual, although sometimes operating in a limited capacity, their employees are looked after and paid no matter what. They are able to work from home and continue earning.. They cannot see any problems and are preaching what they hear from government and the media.</p>
<p>It’s different in NSW, where there is currently an “outbreak” of covid sitting around 200 cases per day. There have been a few deaths but as always there have been coexisting medical issues and not specifically linked to covid other than they died being covid positive.</p>
<p>We cannot visit our families or friends. This is against the health recommendations. According to our government covid is most dangerous at home. Yet we have to “stay home and stay safe.”</p>
<p>The current climate of fear is so strong and people are starting to “dob” on their neighbours for breaking covid rules. This is terrifying and to me is very un-Australian and is signalling the beginning of a very scary time in Australian (and the world’s) history.</p>
<p>As for the firearms issue, we had ours taken after a massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania. It was received well over here and many weapons were ruled illegal, with access to farmers, hunters and shooters. Very difficult to own anything more than a semi automatic over here with a high caliber. Hand guns have nearly always been banned in Australia in recent times. With the obvious exception of licensed gun club members.</p>
<p>I don’t think having guns will protect us from the tyranny of the government, they would provide a false sense of security in my opinion. The government has bigger guns and more ammunition in my opinion. </p>
<p>I am absolutely over all of this political bullshit, it’s no longer about a virus.</p>
<p>Stand up Australia, the time is now.</p>

        <p>One thing to mention.
While all these politicians kept us locked down, and stopped business from operating and forcing people out of jobs not a single one these politicians missed out.
They all got paid as per usual and I genuinely think they don’t actually understand how these practices have effected everyone.</p>
<p>I wasn’t at the first freedom protest in Melbourne but I’m hoping that there is a bigger rally next time and I will definitely be attending.</p>

        <p>The politicians are so out of touch with reality.. Surrounded by their teams of well paid advisors they have no idea of the real world impact their actions are having. It’s disgusting. </p>

        <p>I support you. I understand we cant match the guns any government has if the country does or does not have gun rights. We can still resist and all come together, country to country all around the world and oppose this as we the people. Thank you for your reply. We are all dealing with it at some level.</p>

<p>You are the cancer. Giving up hope on humans that need help and are lost and desperately craving freedom. Even the brainwashed are humans</p>

        <p>Lol. Who the fuck are you. You are asking about Australia.  I fucking live here in Sydney under lock down as we speak. I speak to each reddit sub differently. The Australian ones are fucked. That is a fact. I am banned from some of them because they ban people who don't toe the political line. </p>
<p>I can only do so much.</p>

        <p>It's all good. I think my country is fucked. We have been told over and over again that the only way out of this is to get vaccinated. This is the government and media in lock step screaming all day that we need to take the vaccine. </p>
<p>I just heard out Premier of NSW today during a press conference say to day that masks are going to be forever and lockdowns are going to be a normal.part of life from now on. Then she said that she needs 80% vaccinated before any conversation can be had about not locking down. Then repeated that masks and lockdown are going to be normal thing from now on. </p>
<p>I nearly punched the TV. I am fucking angry. No one even questioned her on any of that. People aren't listening to what she is actually saying. I hope people wake up soon.</p>

        <p>No need to apologise mate. We are allowed to get pissed off and vent sometimes. I do make some stupid comments and am happy to be called out for them. </p>
<p>This lock down in Sydney looks like it is never going to end. Then the Premier saying yesterday that masks and lockdowns are going to be a normal part life now really punched me in the gut.</p>
<p>I consider myself very lucky to have a job throughout this and have never lost a pay check due to pandemic. However at the moment all we do is go to work and then go home. Can't do anything else. Can walk around the block for exercise 2 hours a day. It is getting to everyone.</p>

        <p>Guarantee you most aussies don’t give a shit about guns nor care they don’t have them.</p>
<p>I still own and operate firearms often.
Have a small collection of handguns and many high and low caliber rifles.
There are some requirements to own these but nothing that isn’t easy to pass.
As for the owning handguns, all I’m required to do is be in a few competitions a year and thats it.
As for the rifles all I need to do is renew my club membership and license every few years.</p>
<p>Only gun restrictions in place are for guns that fire fully automatic other wise you can get just about anything.</p>
<p>Majority of aussies still do own firearms however it is still less than it was in the late 90‘s.
However recent indication show the Interest in firearms is growing and a lot more people are getting into it.</p>
