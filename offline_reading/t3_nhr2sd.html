    <strong>How to talk to a vaccine skeptic</strong>
    <p><p>Years ago I respected The New York Times as a good news source. I still get emails from them occasionally.</p>
<p>This morning I received this headline in my inbox: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/20/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-chatbot.html">How to talk to a vaccine skeptic</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't read the piece. Don't really care what it says. But I can tell you exactly how to talk to a vaccine skeptic. Here's what you say:</p>
<p>"I respect your right to bodily autonomy and informed consent. You should never be required or pressured to receive any medical treatment that you don't freely choose, nor should you be required or pressured to disclose your private medical information to anyone but your health care provider."</p>
<p>There you go. No need to log into The New York Times and read their propaganda.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, you could justify that with the current line of reasoning. There are people who need kidney transplants in order to live! If you have two good ones, and you can live with just one, then you're a selfish asshole who wants people to die if you don't hand one over. Your right to bodily autonomy stops where other people's lives are concerned... right?</p>
<p>I'm sure the doomers will be all like "oh that's obviously different, you paranoid lunatic, lol lol lol" but tell me which part of their party line that applies to covid doesn't also apply to handing over surplus organs to those who need them more than you do.</p>

        <p>“The holdings and wealth of John D. Rockefeller and his descendants mushroomed so rapidly that it is difficult to keep track of them. Indeed the task has been made almost impossible because of the family practise of holding stock in the names of nominees and trustees, almost exclusively in many instances. They appear in person in very few corporations which they control. Their nominees and agents are multitudinous. The more important of them are generally placed by the Rockefellers on the boards of trustees of their various "philanthropies" and in the membership of their agencies, especially the Council on Foreign Relations. As a rule, this is done at the time of acquisition of the property for which the individual acts as nominee.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, about 1937 it was rumored that the Rockefellers had acquired control of the New York Times for the sum of seventeen and a half million dollars. At about the same time one of the nominal owners of the Times and its publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, became a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. The name of Rockefeller has never been publicly identified with the Times.</strong> But the publication has been obviously the official journal of the Rockefeller Empire, in much the same sense that the London Times has been the official journal of the British Empire. Reliable information regarding Rockefeller ownership or control of the Times, however, has never been made public.</p>
<p>It has been an apparent <strong>objective of the Rockefeller interests to gain monopolistic control of every necessity of life</strong> and of every source of energy, oil, gas, coal, water-and wind- power, electricity, atomic energy and every other source that exists or comes into being. They have not yet succeeded in making the greatest of all sources of power, the sun, render them tribute. But when a means for doing so will be devised, they will control it, and make the world pay for its solar energy. They seek to control all necessities from the time they are produced until they are consumed, and to cartelize the process. <strong>They control every important governmental agency in the land, and abroad, and have converted them into their private agencies that are empowered to levy upon and confiscate the wealth of every private citizen, and of the nation, through taxation and control of the expenditure of the funds thus levied. The citizenry of the U.S. virtually have been disfranchised in the process.</strong> For all effective purposes, the Rockefellers remain free of taxation under the laws written and enforced by their agents.</p>
<p><strong>As a consequence, the wealth of the Rockefellers is incalculable. Favored by the law, their fortune grows while others are wiped out.</strong> It is doubtful if there exists enough money in the world to make their wealth liquid. For it represents the wealth of all of us, plus control of the natural resources of the larger part of the world, or possibly of all of it. In effect, the wealth of all of us is levied on and, in many instances, confiscated, for the advantage of the Rockefeller Empire. Our tax and other laws are effecting for the Rockefeller interests a monopoly of all the wealth of the nation.”</p>

        <p>Wow. Thanks for sharing that. I merely thought the NYT (and the other papers it owns, like the Washington Post and Boston Globe, also both publications I once held in esteem) had become more and more leftist to the point of extremity, and nowadays being leftist, as opposed to being classically liberal, means disrespect for individual autonomy. If all this is true (and it sounds unconfirmed but a reasonable hypothesis given the evidence) then it is even more disturbing than I thought.</p>
<p>The Rockefellers have a vested interest in big pharma, yes? Regardless, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, source of advertising revenue for the mainstream media, so it's unsurprising that they are reluctant to publish anything remotely critical of medical treatments such as vaccines.</p>

        <p>No, I don't.</p>
<p>Because I am not afraid of covid.</p>
<p>Because I am not at risk from covid.</p>
<p>Because I have heard of numerous severe (and so far, lasting) side effects firsthand from people who have gotten the vaccine.</p>
<p>Because I suspect the real risks from the vaccine are greatly underreported. Our mainstream media adores big pharma and is deep in their pockets.</p>
<p>Because the vaccine is still experimental and I have no desire to be a guinea pig, especially an unpaid one.</p>
<p>Because the vaccine is not FDA approved.</p>
<p>Because the vaccine manufacturers have indemnity.</p>
<p>Because I have certain medical conditions that increase my risk from the vaccine and which I won't discuss because they are none of your business.</p>
<p>Because the idea of telling my body to create a pathogen which will then cause an immune reaction, while it <em>may</em> be medically harmless, is an affront to my personal philosophy and worldview. Not that that's any of your business.</p>
<p>Because I don't want to, and that's the only necessary reason.</p>

        <p>Of course I'm not the boss of you. Feel free to ignore everything I said. I just think it's silly to not get the vaccine and if you're really that worried about it being a huge conspiracy I'd still like us to reach heard immunity so if you catch it in a controlled environment that helps everyone. </p>
<p>It's less common now because covid is going away but I'm sure you could find someone with it and take two weeks off work.</p>

        <p>I’m not arguing the percent risk. Just that the fact that there is some. Down playing and making it seem like there is zero is disingenuous. You can have a real conversation about it.  I’m all for getting vaccines. But there are normal reactions, mild adverse reactions and severe adverse reactions to any vaccine.</p>

        <p>Okay. Let's say I agree (if you are concerned about getting infected with covid, I'd even fully agree, I'm just not that concerned. so for me getting a vaccine would be a reasonable thing to do in order to HOPEFULLY, FINALLY get everyone to fuck off - I don't get my hopes too high about it though). I hope you didn't mean that to be a counterargument to the OP though, because it's not.</p>
