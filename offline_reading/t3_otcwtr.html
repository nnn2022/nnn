    <strong>Can someone please explain to me the differences between normal vaccinates and mrna ones?</strong>
    <p><p>I think I understood what the difference is, but I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p>Please go into detail as much as possible! I wanna understand every little detail.</p></p>

        <p>Normal vaccines contain either a live or dead sample of whatever they are trying to develop antibodies for.  </p>
<p>mRNA contains a bunch of lethal chemicals, no virus at all, and code wrapped in deadly spike proteins, to try and trick your body into making covid, and then by extension antibodies.  Unfortunately the spike protein bonds to muscle and arterial walls causing clotting and myocarditis (basically your body now thinks it's own muscle is the enemy).   These are not good.  And it's also being proven to be horribly ineffective.</p>

        <p>No, thats not what I wanna do here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html">The CDC provides explanations which are concearning, but dont really explain anything.</a> (concearning because when the vaxx instructs body cells to make antigens (the Spike proteins from my understanding) of the virus, it screams to me that it "loses" its natural antigen used as an pass for the immune system. Which would in turn mean that the immune system mistakes these body cells as infected and fights them)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But there are a few questions still open: how does it create blod cloths? for example. Does it really change the blood that extreme? and if it does <em>HOW</em>? </p>
<p>Basically what I'm trying to do is to understand how this new vaxx works. And I want to filter out misinformation as much as possible. I heard spike protein here, poisonous there and deadly over there. But an understaning how it exactly harms the body... No.</p>
<p>I am generelly curious. Tell me what something does and my next question is, how does it do that. Sometimes I spent waiting time by looking at different things and ask myself how would I automate a production producing said thing.</p>

        <p>Some of the common misconceptions in this group are revolved around how the vaccine works. It does not inject you with spike proteins. It utilizes the RNA in the cytoplasm of your cell to create a temporary spike protein on the cell wall that is NOT COVId, it is strictly mimicking the structure of the spike protein that COVId uses. Once evaluated by the cells and lymph nodes it is trashed and the memory of that spike protein remains as a something it should eradicate and not allow in. It basically is like putting a BOLO out for that particular spike protein. </p>
<p>Viruses use spike proteins to attach to cells and infiltrate to the nucleus, the vaccine prevents it, most of the time, from being able to latch on to a host cell. Most other vaccines use a live version of whatever virus in monitored amounts to present to the body and your body has the upper hand in fighting it to create memory for antibodies. The mRNA vaccination is strictly a different vehicle that allows a smarter way for your body to build defenses. </p>
<p>The question with Delta variant and the vaccine now is if the spike protein is the same or different. If flu or the common cold presented with the same spike protein, it would be a one and done vaccination no matter how many variants. We will see. The concept of mRNA vaccines isn’t new, it’s just the best way to vaccinate for COVId, specifically. Somehow this vaccine turned into a political debate though with society. It’s been interesting to watch unfold, from a paramedics perspective, to say the least. </p>
<p>Usually it takes a death in the immediate to extended family for anti-vax people to change their minds. It beckons back to the “see it to believe it” mentality without regard for field experts and healthcare providers who call a spade a spade. There is no correlation with any major side effects that has been certified to be true. You’ll see stuff on here about infertility, deformed babies (which is hilarious considering the vaccine hasn’t been out for 40 weeks yet), blood clots, strokes, etc. There just isn’t any studied evidence to support that the vaccine has any of those properties. </p>
<p>The vaccine got its initial studies following the SARS virus. Hence why it is SARS-COVId-2. People have no idea how medical things work and assume it didn’t have enough time to be evaluated or designed properly. Those same people must not realize that coronavirus has been around for many years in the animal population and has had a pet vaccination for many years. I’m not really sure why people are against it. There really is no sound logic to not be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Hold up, so you hand wave away the adverse reactions as if they are inconsequential when it seems younger people are easily passing the virus through their system and coming out fine. But let's make them undertake more risk for less reward, because that is sound logic.</p>
<p>I'm simply amazed how you choose to see things the way you do. You mention how it "usually takes a death in the immediate family" for someone to come around to the vaccine, yet you undermine the same concept when it relates to that same immediate family being injured or dying from the same thing. What do you call that? </p>
<p>You can, somehow, act as if there is nothing linking to the vax with these problems. But you dont know that for sure. And that's the truth. And people have no reason to trust the "experts" since one could make a video that runs days on end showcasing the absolute disaster they have been. Some for decades.</p>

        <p>I am not disrespecting your credentials, I am simply saying you are discrediting everything with your statement. That doesn't seem right to me, being as you don't know these people and have no historical point of reference to base a common theme with. Whereas with the gov, and pharma in general, I can point to many historical instances where they have lied and fucked over many many people.</p>
<p>If someone develops neurological problems or an enlarged heart, why would you immediately defect to something else? All things relative, but if someone is living a certain way consistently and they develop odd issues out of the blue, with only the vax changing their routine, what would your gut initially go to?</p>
<p>I am not an expert on any of the above fields. I am however a non-believer in gov doing good because they have shown as much.</p>

        <p>I’ve<br>
written in a comment above my understanding of our immune system, or at least<br>
what I can still remember.</p>
<p>&rt;<br>
From my knowledge of the immune system is that<br>
there are some cells which actively hunt and destroy foreign cells, which can<br>
be identified by these SP (every Cell has a SP which acts as a passport for the<br>
"police" (immune system))<br>
The "hunter" cell multiplies and presents these SP towards the immune<br>
system which then in turn instructs "factory" cells to produce antibody<br>
specifically designed to bond with the new SP and it also instructs specialized<br>
hunter cells to look specifically for cells with that exact SP which makes the<br>
hunt much more effective.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
(That’s at least from what I can remember. I have ofc forgotten all the scientific terms...)</p>
<p>I have probably mistaken the antigen with the spike protein. That’s because I never<br>
heard of said protein prior the debate around the vaccine, so I tried fitting<br>
it in with my already existing knowledge.<br>
But as you are working in the medicine field from what I understood you can<br>
surely correct or update me...<br>
Such a mRNA vaccine apparently skips some steps in the immune response compared with a conventional vaccine.</p>
<p>So, my question now is: <br>
where does an mRNA vaccine work in the immune system?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Some of the common misconceptions in this group<br>
are revolved around how the vaccine works. <br>
It does not inject you with spike proteins. It utilizes the RNA in the<br>
cytoplasm of your cell to create a temporary spike protein on the cell wall<br>
that is NOT COVId, <br>
it is strictly mimicking the structure of the spike protein that COVId uses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, it doesn’t<br>
alter the DNA, but inserts temporary instructions for the SPs? Which are<br>
overwritten the next time instructions from the DNA makes it to the cytoplasm?<br>
When a Macrophage a cell meets with said SP, shouldn’t it attack said cell? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Once evaluated by the cells and lymph nodes it<br>
is trashed and the memory of that spike protein remains as a something it<br>
should eradicate and not allow in. It basically is like putting a BOLO out for<br>
that particular spike protein.</p>
<p>What is a BOLO? xD</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Viruses use spike proteins to attach to cells<br>
and infiltrate to the nucleus, the vaccine prevents it, most of the time, from<br>
being able to latch on to a host cell. </p>
<p>How does it do that? From my understanding has the immune system a hard time dealing with free Viruses. <br>
But when a virus infects a body cell with its DNA the cell loses (changes) its antigen<br>
(its passport for the T-Killer cell) so when a T-Killer cell sees an infected<br>
Cell it destroys it and with it a potentially virus producing factory.<br>
So how is the vaccine able to prevent a virus from infecting a body cell?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Most other vaccines use a live version of<br>
whatever virus in monitored amounts to present to the body and your body has<br>
the upper hand in fighting it to create memory for antibodies. The mRNA<br>
vaccination is strictly a different vehicle that allows a smarter way for your<br>
body to build defenses.<br>
The question with Delta variant and the vaccine now is if the spike protein is<br>
the same or different. If flu or the common cold presented with the same spike<br>
protein, it would be a one and done vaccination no matter how many variants.</p>
<p>That’s something completely new for me. What I thought till now was that once a pathogen mutates, it’s SP completely changes so the immune system has to re-learn that it's dangerous.</p>
<p>&rt;We will see. The concept of mRNA vaccines isn’t<br>
new, it’s just the best way to vaccinate for COVId, specifically. Somehow this<br>
vaccine turned into a political debate though with society. It’s been<br>
interesting to watch unfold, from a paramedics’ perspective, to say the least.</p>
<p>That’s because<br>
the surrounding circumstances of the vaccine (vaccine passports, the current pressure<br>
people into taking the vaccine, vaccine being more and more mandatory for more<br>
and more Jobs). Without those there’d be hardly a debate. And then people find data like these: </p>

<p>&rt;Usually, it takes a death in the immediate to extended<br>
family for anti-vax people to change their minds. It beckons back to the “see<br>
it to believe it” mentality without regard for field experts and healthcare<br>
providers who call a spade a spade. </p>
<p>I’ve heard and seen the exact opposite. Vaccine creating adverse reactions within a close relative, thus completely turning the family into anti vaxx.<br>
I for my part am biased against vaccines in general cause my mom developed<br>
neurodermitis after a tick shot, and because of that I am not vaccined against<br>
anything and don’t see any reason to change that even with the situation<br>
currently ongoing for 1½ years. </p>
<p>The probability for adverse reactions may be<br>
small, but why should I challenge my bad luck?</p>
<p>&rt;There is no correlation with any major side<br>
effects that has been certified to be true. You’ll see stuff on here about<br>
infertility, deformed babies (which is hilarious considering the vaccine hasn’t<br>
been out for 40 weeks yet), blood clots, strokes, etc. There just isn’t any<br>
studied evidence to support that the vaccine has any of those properties.</p>
<p>Do we really need studies if we have above mentioned and linked data?</p>

        <p>All C-19 vaccines require the "spike protein" or SP to provoke an "immune response" in your body.</p>
<p>The difference between mRNA jabs (eg Pfizer, Moderna) and traditional deactivated virus jabs (eg SinoVac) are how the SPs are delivered.</p>
<p>mRNA is a genetic code, a piece of "recipe", that instructs the cells to produce the SP.</p>
<p>Deactivated virus straightaway gives the SP ready to serve without any genetic code. The genetic material in the virus cell is useless, it has been chemically destroyed. The active ingredient is the SP.</p>
<p>The issue is that the SP itself is a toxin, hence it is causing so much mayhem around the world. They're injecting the SP straight into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>What makes mRNA deadlier is that once the mRNA is in the cell, the cells start producing the SP, and the SP sticks out from the cell wall. The immune system mistakes the body's own cells as virus, because of the SPs on the cell surface, and attacks the body's cells, causing autoimmune phenomenon. And the production of SPs will never cease. It goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>While traditional vaccines only inject readily-made SPs into the body, and once the foreign SPs are destroyed by the body's immune system, no more SPs are left, since there is no "recipe" to produce more SPs. This is why SinoVac is arguably "safer", but I'm still quite doubtful. Nonetheless, taking IVM/HCQ after the jab could mitigate the intensity of adverse reactions, preventing too many SPs from sticking to cell walls. But if one takes mRNA, that's rather difficult to control</p>

        <p>Can that mrna really affect all cells?</p>
<p>From my knowledge of the immune system is that there are some cells which actively hunt and destroy foreign cells, which can be identified by these SP (every Cell has a SP which acts as an passport for the "police" (immunsystem))</p>
<p>The "hunter" cell multiplies and presents these SP towards the immune system which then in turn instructs "factory" cells to produce antibody specifically designed to bond with the new SP and it also instructs specialized hunter cells to look specifically for cells with that exact SP which makes the hunt much more effective.</p>
<p>(Thats at least from what I can remember. I have ofc forgotten all the sientific terms...)</p>

        <p>Close enough, the SPs were supposed to provoke the immune system to send out antibodies, IIRC. That was the general principle.</p>
<p>Speaking on the mRNA, I remember there was a Japanese study two months ago where the SPs are found all over the body, because the mRNA might have travelled beyond the deltoid muscle (injection side), though I'm not sure about the details</p>

        <p>Very simply, a vaccine is a deadened piece of virus. It’s introduced into your body. Your immune system recognizes it as a virus and builds immunity to it, you don’t get sick because the virus your immune system  is using to map out immunity is dead. </p>
<p>mRNA vaccines simply send a mRNA coded “blueprint” that tells your body to produce spike proteins that fight the virus. Straight up. It bypasses your immune system completely. </p>
<p>In laymen’s terms, your body is the computer, your DNA is the OS. Natural immunity would be your standard antivirus software doing its job. mRNA is installing a temporary anti virus software to get rid of the problem. </p>
<p>End of the day, both processes get you to immunity. It’s the length of immunity and how immune you are that differs. It seems natural immunity has longer lasting defense against Covid (95% for one year) vs 70% on the vaccines per recent data.</p>
