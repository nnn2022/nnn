    <strong>My friends that work in healthcare are becoming loonier by the day</strong>
    <p><p>I sent a cdc chart to a friend that showed deaths are not increasing in any significant way and she unironically responded with this:</p>
<p>I‚Äôm going into an isolation room for an hour and a half straight in full PPE. So don‚Äôt come at me with non-science based opinions. You‚Äôre acting ridiculous.</p></p>

        <p>I can't deal with emotionally-charged people who act like drama queens. I work in healthcare as well and there are so many people who are in a constant state of panic and fear. Stop acting like a lunatic and be a professional. We are a year-and-a-half into this now. I was actually happy to hear that my BF cousin is leaving the pharmaceutical industry, her and her sister  both have Pharmacy degrees and work in labs and they have seen some insane lies and Corruption recently that are feeding the narrative we are hearing right now. Every time someone has balls and pushes back on this and doesn't cooperate they are a goddamn hero.</p>

        <p>Full PPE? That‚Äôs like a daily thing in health care. When my oldest was an infant and was hospitalized with ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù (it was really an adverse reaction to a vaccine), anytime the nurses came in to her room they had on full PPE. Which kind of freaked us out at first. They even had a scary sign outside the door reminding the staff to wear PPE when entering. So what‚Äôs the big deal? They deal with sick people and wear full PPE on a regular basis. It‚Äôs nothing new. These are the same people who love to remind us they wear a mask for 8 hours a day so we should be able to handle wearing one to the grocery store. So is it a big deal or nah?</p>

        <p>Yeah but she‚Äôs not in that type of hospital she‚Äôs in a physical rehabilitation clinic which traditionally wouldn‚Äôt wear PPE under normal circumstances. I don‚Äôt care if ppl want to wear full ppe when in isolation I just find it funny when she simultaneously calls me ridiculous</p>

        <p>Yep I was just looking at the mortalities. Like most viruses that become more contagious, it‚Äôs becoming weaker. Domestic fit the narrative. Now it‚Äôs the lambda &amp; other variants Fauci is BSing about</p>
