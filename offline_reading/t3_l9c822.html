        <p>Excerpt from this article:</p>
<p>&rt; More than half the people we surveyed reported these changes for the better: being more appreciative of things usually taken for granted (reported by 83% of participants), having more time to do enjoyable things (by 67%), spending more time in nature or outdoors (by 65%), paying more attention to personal health (by 62%), doing more physical activity (by 54%) and spending more time with a partner or spouse (by 53%).</p>
<p>&rt; An Australian study (still in preprint, meaning its findings are yet to be reviewed by other scientists) also sought to find out similar information. In a survey of over 1,000 people, it found that 70% of participants reported having experienced at least one positive effect of the pandemic. Three main positive effects noted in this survey were: having the opportunity to spend more time with family, having greater flexibility in working arrangements and appreciating having a less busy life.</p>
<p>&rt; The important role of time was highlighted across both studies. Lockdown has removed many of life’s routines and demands – and for some people this has afforded them more time to spend on activities they enjoyed and valued. Noticing that how we spend time has changed – and thinking about what we can do with any additional time that we have – may be an important first step in making positive changes to our lives during lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt; People also noted being more appreciative of things previously taken for granted and the slower pace of life that lockdown has brought. For many people, this may have enabled them to step back and reflect on their lives, their futures and what is important to them in a way that they would not otherwise have the opportunity to do, without the demands of daily commutes or social commitments.</p>
<p>This seems to be priming people to accept this sort of life. It parrots a lot of the same talking points I've seen online when supporting something like the Great Reset and UBI; that this will usher in an age of "decadence" where people will be happier because they will solely dedicate their time to hobbies, and to their loved ones. That, also, people will be happier without the stress of having to work and commute, or having to commit to social events, or having to meet with people they don't know. </p>
<p>I think this is all bullshit, personally.</p>

        <p>That sounds like hell. Okay, work and commuting aren't exactly fun but it's not that bad, and no way am I willing to sacrifice social events and meeting new people just to avoid the morning drive. And working from home would stress me out more than going in to work because at least I get to talk to others in person and I'm not trapped at a desk for 10 hours.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I don’t like commuting, driving long distances stresses me out sometimes (bad weather, traffic etc) but I would take it any day over languishing unemployed at home for months. I was unemployed for a while last year after I had to leave a job to move states, and all I did was drink, watch cartoons and shitpost on here because I was so depressed while watching my savings deplete and my credit card balance go up. I absolutely hated it. Driving an hour in the snow every day is by far a better option.</p>
