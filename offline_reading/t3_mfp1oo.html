        <p>The world began to question in Sept 2019, when the Fed started printing $100B every two weeks to keep the market up, whether the financial markets were real anymore. Meaning is it just paper printing not economics driving world business. That would have exposed the wizard behind the curtain and lead to riots. </p>
<p>So what did they try first to deflect attention and have an excuse to print money? War!</p>
<p>Remember in early 2020 they tried to fabricate a war with Iran? Obviously they probably picked up sentiment from the population that no one wanted to go fight another phoney war. </p>
<p>So then comes Coronahoax as a Plan B. Remember countries are run by the same bankers so saying China would not be in it cause they are a rival means you seriously missed the point. Look up what the Bank of International Settlements is and itâ€™s role. There are no independent countries (even the boogeyman ones presented to us)</p>
