        <p>We're reaching a new level of Karenism that shouldn't even be possible. I've had people approach me and tell me I don't have a disability - I'm glad the people who claim to listen to doctors are completely ignoring them! </p>
<p>If you work at a store that requires masks, please do not enforce this on people who say they have medical conditions and/or can't breathe. People aren't kidding, they aren't saying that they can't breathe as a joke. This is why disabled people will always finish last, people refuse to even believe you out of their own arrogance.</p>
<p>Ugh. Stop telling me I can breathe when I can't. Don't expect me to sacrifice my health for yours if you don't care about mine. Your health is your responsibility, just like my health is mine.</p>

        <p>It turns out that "your mask protects me" is a totally <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">false</a> claim. Mask-wearing actually makes diseases spread more easily to others, according to scientific evidence from controlled experiments.</p>

        <p>Almost my entire family has been in medicine and they whole-heartedly agree! People claim that those working closely with others in the medical field are fine because they wear masks - they also wear gowns, gloves, protective eyewear etc. And they are taught how to actually use the PPE according to code rather than just picking up a mask and acting like they're heroes. They actually use disinfectant and don't think masks are a magical forcefield against viruses - it even says that they are NOT to be used for this on the boxes they are shipped in.</p>
<p>They also have actual experience dealing with issues like this before, and they know that it will pass if doomers don't destroy society themselves. They have seen serious threats come and go for decades, and every single time there are people preaching the end of days is upon us. I don't even see what the point is trying to argue with doomers anymore. They say we don't understand basic science, but they are the ones that don't. They call us Karen while violating the social distancing holy laws they view so preciously, just to get in our faces and scream at us. </p>
<p>I think we all blacked out simultaneously and bought tickets to the circus at the same time. It used to be funny, now it's just sad.</p>
<p>My grandparents have made millions from their assistance in building the Medtronic company and they agree - it really is just a culture of fear. Medicine should be a required course in school, and science class need to teach these people how to interpret data correctly!</p>

        <p>Hang in there, the hysteria will die down and these crazies will be totally discredited. It's great that your family is sensible and intelligent; we know that mask-nazis don't come from good families and no one taught them any manners. We should probably just feel sorry for them, at this point.</p>

        <p>it's the CO2 not O2 that you're feeling. They don't want to correct people because then they'd have to admit there are issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kUfF2MTnqAw">You don't notice hypoxia</a> (and it tends to make you dissociate/not care) but you <a href="https://youtu.be/1Nh_vxpycEA">definitely do notice high CO2</a></p>
<p>the pulse oximeter tests aren't wrong, they just aren't honest</p>

        <p>I unsubscribed to that subreddit because of this article. I originally subscribed in March when I really needed uplifting news. However, recently itâ€™s been doomer posts. This was the boiling point.</p>
