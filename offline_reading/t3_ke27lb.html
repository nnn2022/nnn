    <strong>I just wish people would admit that they wear a mask out of fear of being shamed -- not because they're worried about the safety of others.</strong>
    <p><p>Do these idiots not realize that I <em>also</em> grew up in the United States of America and know exactly how people are here? Especially in the modern era?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, even the good people in our country are selfish as fuck and only care about getting theirs. This mindset is drilled into our heads from birth by the media, by school, and ultimately by our consumerist culture in general. <strong>GET YOURS AND SCREW EVERYONE ELSE!!!</strong></p>
<p>So kiss my ass you care about the safety of others lmao. Fellow American, I know for a fact that 99% of you simply don't wanna be shamed or ridiculed because you're a weak coward. Hence why in private and behind closed doors, everyone I know who publicly supports masks and lockdowns, tells me how it's weird and something doesn't feel right.</p></p>

        <p>I had a loser here on Reddit go through my post history and try to "cancel" me on totally unrelated sub by saying I post anti-mask crap because I post in this sub.  Everyone is weak and just wants to destroy anyone who dares question the groupthink.  The extent to which they'll go to try to cancel the people with differing opinions is pretty great.</p>

        <p>I’ll do this for two reasons: 
1. I live in a cold area, and the mask keeps my face warm! It’s quite nice!
2. When I do walk by someone I don’t have to fumble to put my mask on as I walk by them, it’s just convenient to have it on already.</p>
<p>If I’m out on a hike or something and want fresh air, then I’ll have it off and do the whole put it on when walking by someone, but when I’m in town I might as well just keep it on.</p>

        <p>Do you really need to put one on when you walk by someone for seconds, though? There's a really low risk of transmission from that. I'd almost say nil. Even my local medical officer of health said that in a radio interview once. Specifically, she said that to transmit COVID, you'd typically have to be face to face with the person for 15 minutes, both unmasked.</p>

        <p>It doesn't actually. I just looked it up and being outdoors is one of the exemptions. (https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)</p>
<p>I admit that it is confusing(probably purposefully so) to say "It’s now required that everyone in California must wear a mask or face covering when outside of their home, with limited exceptions" and then have one of the exceptions be being outside "Outdoors and maintaining at least 6 feet of social distance from others not in their household. You must have a face covering with you at all times and must put it on if you are within 6 feet of others who are not in your household."</p>
<p>If anything, it just shows how incompetent/corrupt the state is even more.</p>

        <p>I was in Lake Placid, NY about a month ago and they have a mask "mandate" when walking around outside on Main Street. Fuck that, I'm outside, not sick, I'm not wearing a stupid fucking mask. Majority of people would wear them, but a good amount were like me. We would do the subtle head nod to each other when walking by, it felt good to know that there are others out there.</p>

        <p>I was in Salem, MA in early October and the downtown area had signs everywhere saying "mask required zone." We ignored it and just walked around minding our business. A woman in an orange vest walked up and told us we had to put masks on. She had a bag of them. I told her we have health conditions and can't do it but thanks anyway. She said "oh okay" and left. It really is that simple.</p>

        <p>Same. My line is outside and when alone in my office at work. Fortunately I live in an area that’s more relaxed and few people wear them outside. In the future, another line will be if I get the vaccine, I’m done with masks.</p>

        <p>It doesn’t surprise me, but I’m not doing that. If the vaccine really turns out to be 95% effective, there is no conceivable reason to continue with masks once it is available to everyone and there’s been time for it to kick in. I’m not wearing a mask for the rest of my life because there’s a tiny fraction of a chance I might be carrying a virus the mask may or may not stop from spreading. That’s where people need to stand up and say “no” to becoming a germaphobe culture.</p>

        <p>Where I am, (Ontario Canada) I feel like a lot of people, if not the majority only comply because they either don’t want to put up a fight with others and get recorded and be plastered all over the internet as a “Karen”, be kicked out of a store (you can’t go ANYWHERE without a mask, they are mandated literally everywhere and you won’t gain entry anywhere without one) or they don’t want to pay a fine. We have bylaw officers that are ramping up fines for not wearing one. Two businesses just got fined yesterday for employees not correctly wearing masks and the fines are $880 and individual people can and have been fined too. I feel like these are more valid reasons other then people actually caring about others, or being in actual fear. I’m 3 hours from Toronto....we are currently at 33 active cases with just over 500 total people getting the virus in a community of over 100,000+. We’ve seen compliance go down here, so they ramp up the ramifications if you don’t comply. It’s completely fucked and I’m sick of it.</p>

        <p>I live in Ontario and I’ve never worn a mask, ever. I go to walmert, shoppers, the post office, my mechanic, the emergency room and I started a job. Now I get disability for a condition that’s on the exemption list but I’ve never been asked for proof. I usually just say “ I can’t wear one” and that’s it. I was pressed more at the hospital but as soon as I said I’m on disability they stopped. No proof, no papers, just my word. It’s so much easier than people think.
My mom was told to “self isolate” by the health unit because someone had tested positive had been in there over 10 days before. The email said it was a RECOMMENDATION. No mandate, no quarantine. There was no appeal process just the threat of a fine. She worked her other job and still went to the store as normal and nothing happened. 
It’s literally a bunch of empty threats. I’ve heard most fines get thrown out anyway if you fight it, but most people don’t try to fight the system. Kinda like the health units, people just assume they have that kind of power and roll over and accept it. 
It is so much easier than anyone realizes! But you do you, you do what feels right to you. I have no problem putting my face out there and threat of a fine because I KNOW it won’t hold up if I fight it.</p>

        <p>Here's that data you asked for:</p>
<p>The scientific literature available establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., “N95”) does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p>Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) “Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,” American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 – 419. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002</p>
<p>N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>

<p>“We identified six clinical studies … .

<p>“Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. ...

<p>“A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>

        <p>Most of the countries with tiny infection rates have a very low population density and a vastly different climate than the USA. When you compare the United States to similar European countries, the statistics are pretty close in terms of infections and deaths per million. </p>
<p>Per capita, the USA has a lower covid death rate <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/">than the UK</a></p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of these statistical differences also come from a lack of universal reporting criteria.

        <p>I literally don't care what NPCs and other people think, unless it's someone close to me. Whether they attempt to shame me or some other emotional manipulation, it doesn't effect me. And I agree that all of these mask virtue signalers don't actually care about protecting others either but rather are just hopping on the trendy cause bandwagon that will give them social status points. If Covid ever blows over, they'll just migrate to the next trendy collective  humanitarian endeavor; even if it was something weirdly out of left field like the media promoting remote Amazonian tribes being given shoes because of an epidemic of foot splinters becoming infected with flesh eating bacteria. A cause like that would captivate them more than something close to home, yet not televised, like if their entire town was rotting from poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, arson, and violent crime. They'd wear 'Save the Amazonians' pins, make beseeching FB posts calling their friends to help the Amazonians from getting foot amputations, and shame others for being so selfish that they did  not donate shoes to the cause. This is the mentally; it's like some kind of lemming narcissist personality type.</p>

        <p>This is so true. I’ve been saying this for years. I’ve known people that would always have some cause to fight for (save darfur, lgbtq, endless nonsense) and go to protests only to get arrested and accomplish nothing. And if it was all the way across the world then it was even better. Like those stupid celebrities that go to Africa to be filmed with the starving kids there to virtue signal. Or the people that give Christians a bad name and take “missionary trips” to poor countries (they’re just vacations). The money spent on the trip could’ve went to local children. There’s kids born into horrible homes in every city I’ve ever seen. Some of these people couldn’t keep an income and make enough money to feed themselves yet they want to save the world. It’s because they want to feel morally superior. I’m all for helping people, but we should all start at home and then the community and I just see through their arrogant facade. They don’t actually care, they just convince themselves they do. It’s bizarre.</p>

        <p>Maybe it's just a time-management thing. You obviously spend many hours concerning yourself with others' motivations for doing something you won't. Why do you care? </p>
<p>People who study this shit for a living say it helps to wear a mask, so I wear a mask. It's such a pathetically tiny effort to make that I couldn't imagine spending hours (1) trying to rationalize why I won't do it or (2) trying to find a dozen new ways to insult or categorize others for doing it. </p>

        <p>There’s so much clinical and scientific evidence that it’s appalling people are this terrified to wear a mask in public. There’s clear understanding on how to make this go away and for life to get back to normal but we have a scary large group of the population that just completely ignores science and logic.

        <p>I live in Finland and it is not mandatory to wear masks here. It is only "strongly recommended". There is currently 35 patients in ICU because of coronavirus infection (population 5,5 million). The "strong recommendation" to wear a mask hasn't had any effect on the infection rate curves. I don't know, do we have any real world data from anywhere in the world showing mask use is beneficial? I have only seen comments "but it would be worse if we wouldn't wear masks".</p>

        <p>The people saying it would be worse have no clue what they’re talking about.  Look at any case, mortality or r curve from around the world.  No matter when masks are brought into widespread usage there is nothing in those curves that suggest that masks did anything.  It’s really obvious.  I think the whole mask discussion really needs to be settled now.  We have many many papers and rct studies that come to the conclusion that masks are ineffective.  Now we have real world data from a viral pandemic with widespread usage of masks.  I’d say it’s pretty cut and dry that they do not do a damn thing.</p>

        <p>There is none.</p>
<p>There are structured studies showing the effectiveness of MEDICAL GRADE masks<em>helping</em> to prevent covid droplets from flying out after a sneeze in a medical setting. Obviously, real life is fraught with non-medical grade masks, people touching them, not changing them several times a day, etc. </p>
<p>The reality is - nowhere in the world that I’m aware of (and I’ve researched this a lot) have shown any statistically significant decrease in deaths due to the implementation of mask mandates. Island nations, places with no international presence, and countries where the government numbers cannot be believed (aka China) notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Italy and and Belgium both have mask mandates with Italy showing an almost 100% rate of wearing masks, even before the mandate. Both have skyrocketing deaths and have more deaths per 1mm people than the USA. </p>
<p>TL;DR: masks might work in a controlled experiment to help prevent droplets, but in practice, they aren’t proven do anything of any statistical significance.</p>

        <p>Yes. Even our healthcare officials (Finland, THL) don't claim masks are effective. The only thing they say is that via reducing the spread of droplets masks MAY help reduce infections. </p>
<p>And because of this wording and lack of any real world data I just can't understand why do people use masks. And how on earth have they been able to make it illegal to not wear a mask in some countries, I just don't understand it. It is absurd!</p>

        <p>My family actually doesn’t  believe in corona. Or they believe is a bad flu the media overblew. My mom works in the ER. She also believes it’s a bad flu. </p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure most people who wear masks do it because they believe it protects them, despite the loud proclamations that they do it to protect others. The evidence doesn't matter to the sheep, and they are happy to virtue signal while secretly hoping they are safer from a non-existent threat to themselves.</p>

        <p>&rt; Generally speaking, even the good people in our country are selfish as fuck and only care about getting theirs.</p>
<p>This is what bothers me most about this whole "most people in society are collectivists!" B.S. i've never heard prior to this pandemic and have only heard spouted during this pandemic. No, most people are not. And it's not even just Americans OP, it's everyone on this planet. Most people, innately, are individualists. The name of the game of existing as an animal is survival... And that means putting your needs first. And it's not even conscientious... It's literally nature, an innate instinct.</p>
<p>Just being forced to share with everyone else or to do what everyone else does doesn't make you a collectivist... Like yea, I pay taxes not because i'm a collectivist... But because i'm forced to. Same with masks, same with tons of stuff.</p>
<p>And the whole logic of most people being collectivists falls apart in regards to every facet of this pandemic, which is so ironic since most "most people people are collectivists" espousers are using this pandemic to try and prove their point. Like yeah, people raided grocery stores like mad wolves and hoarded toilet paper all for themselves when the lockdowns first started because they're collectivists right? </p>
<p>Not to mention if most people were truly collectivists, then lockdowns wouldn't even be a thing, or continue to be a thing, since then presumably MOST people would already be staying at home and limiting the spread. But yeah, pretty much every country in the world did lockdowns to stop the minority of individualists from spreading the virus right!? /s</p>
<p>No, governments did that because they KNOW most people are individualists and will do whatever they want. It's been proven - less than 10% of people follow quarantine protocols in the UK and Canada... And I imagine it's the same worldwide. Doesn't seem like a stat that supports most people being collectivists...</p>
<p>I seriously could go on and on. I just lose so many brain cells seeing those stupid comments where people really try to act like most members of society are collectivists just because we're all forced to do the same thing and follow the same rules...</p>

        <p>It's no wonder why people are so polarized with this pandemic. The Left-run media paints this false picture that everyone is wearing masks and distancing and isolating with lockdowns out of the goodness of their heart and to protect everyone else because after all "we're all in this together!"</p>
<p>Then the lockdowns are eased and unsurprisingly people go to restaurants, gyms, socialize again and go back to living their lives and all those people are demonized as selfish assholes who only care about themselves... Not the people the news told them everyone is.</p>
<p>Like really, it's full circle. I shouldn't surprised, but it's just so ridiculous how gullible and brain washed news-watchers are. So detached from reality.</p>

        <p>Please for humanity’s sake, if you do not want to wear the mask, TEST the rules and do NOT wear the mask outside.  Healthy people are NOT BIOHAZARDS.  Individuals must take control of their own health.  That means if people want to wear a mask, they should wear an N95 or better.  If they want to shut down their business, be my guest.  If they want to stay indoors, go for it.  But they should never FORCE others to do so!  How many people yelling about masks eat fats food on the regular, don’t exercise, or do not take supplements... these people don’t take their health seriously, so why place the entire focus of their health in you!? It’s utter ridiculousness</p>

        <p>In our society, you must have preconceived knowledge of having and thus, spreading a deadly illness to others to be considered a crime.  Except in CA, where you can give AIDS to anybody without prosecution... I’m not in favor of this.</p>
<p>As I’ve stated, healthy individuals are not weapons or biohazards.  Before DEMANDING vast changes to OTHER healthy individuals, maybe people should take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY for their OWN bodies, and do everything in their OWN power to protect themselves.  Not much to ask, except that most people who want everybody else to change seem to label those they’re forcing changes upon as “selfish”, when in reality are actually the selfish ones!</p>

        <p>I only wear a mask because trespassing is a real thing, and every business where I live has been bullied into submission by the governor and various health departments. I wear it to gain access (pick up my food, get groceries (Costco), and other things I need to live. And no, I don't wear one outside.</p>

        <p>I will admit that I wear a mask out of not wanting to be shamed.  Or more specifically out of not wanting to be cancelled.  Or even more specifically out of needing to continue to shelter and feed my family.  If I stopped wearing a mask my career would be over.  Does that make me a coward?  Maybe.  But wearing a mask, as stupid and dehumanizing as it is, doesn't quite meet my criteria for dying on a hill and letting my children starve.</p>
<p>That said, it's funny that you (OP) bring up the screw everyone else mentality.  I used to really like people, and was the sort of person who would always help out.  After this year however I have become and will remain completely in it for myself and my family.  I won't ever give a penny to charity again.  I couldn't care less about helping some community initiative or doing something to "help those in need".  You know why?  Because this year has shown me that the very society I would seek to help, will throw me under the bus and leave me jobless and destitute in a heartbeat if it suits their whims.  I'm still lucky to have a job, but like anyone else my day may be coming.  So for now I am hoarding every extra dollar I make in order to ensure that I can take care of my family for as long as possible if I'm suddenly deemed non-essential.  And I will continue to do so until the day I'm buried in my cold grave (from death due to Covid of course).</p>
<p>2020 has taught me one thing very clearly.  We are not in this together.  Every person is in it for themselves.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask because where I live I need one to get on the bus and to enter college, otherwise I wouldn't wear it at all. You shouldn't be ashamed for not wearing a mask. And if it's legal to not wear one, or the fines are unconstitutional you should not wear one just because the government tells you to.</p>

        <p>Glad I live around a lot of people who equally hate masks, and are wearing them because the sign on the door says they have to.</p>
<p>Stepped out to Target this past Sunday. First time not wearing mask.  No one hassled me, and that’s a place that is PC-all the way.  I did have one Shipt shopper lady tell me she’s on my side about it, yet was wearing one herself.  I didn’t give her shit about hers.  Just left it alone.  Didn’t wear one at the gym last night either.  No problem.  Small victories, but a return to normal feels one step closer.</p>

        <p>I always ask (rhetorically) if someone would be fine with “#StayingTheFuckHomeAndSavingLivesWithMasksOn if any of these were true:</p>
<ol>
<li>They couldn’t post about it online at all or tell anyone they were doing it. No hashtags, no virtue signaling at all.</li>
<li>All delivery services were closed down due to lockdowns. No more DoorDash, Amazon, etc.</li>
<li>(This one is more of a thought experiment) The internet itself had to be shut down. All ISPs were closed due to lockdowns somehow and the internet ceased to function. No social media, no Netflix, no Zoom, no online video games, etc.</li>
<li>They are personally affected. So if they were already a social outcast who stayed home (or wanted to), worked from home (or always wanted to), and played video games / watched Netflix while eating delivery. They never went to the gym, out with friends, to parties, hated family gatherings and hid upstairs the whole time - basically a loser. </li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously no one would say Yes but we all know the real answer here.</p>

        <p>I do it mainly out of wanting to avoid conflict when all I’m trying to do is buy milk or something, and because there’s <em>some</em> evidence they help. It’s easier, at this point. HOWEVER, and this is a big however, there is a point when I say “no.” Currently that means not wearing a mask while in my own little office space at work since there is NO conceivable reason to do so. In the future, it means I stop wearing a mask after being vaccinated (or after the vaccine is widespread if I don’t end up getting one). They want us to wear masks and socially distance forever, and I won’t play that game. Hopefully other people will be done too.</p>
<p>About the selfishness thing, though, you are correct. I don’t believe the US suddenly became a nation of angels when COVID hit. It’s all about fear and virtue signaling.</p>

        <p>I wear a mask because in NJ it’s mandatory by law. If I want to go into a store, I need to wear a mask. It’s fine, I’m used to it, and the masks aren’t what I’m too concerned with anyway. I’d be happy if they reopened everything, even if I had to wear a mask, better than everything being closed. </p>
<p>I definitely don’t wear a mask when I’m outside though. I see people on hiking trails wearing them, it just seems so miserable. I feel like getting outside for some fresh air is my one escape from all of this. I was beyond pissed when Murphy tried to close state parks.</p>
<p>I personally don’t have a problem with people wearing masks if they want to. That’s their decision, if that makes them feel safe, go ahead. But stop harassing other people for not doing it. I’m wearing it now, but in May when the mask mandate is gone, and some asshole harasses me for STILL not wearing a mask, then I’ll draw the line. And I know it’ll happen</p>

        <p>Thing is: the tighter you make a rule, the more ingenious people become in finding loopholes around it.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, I think that's why transmissions have supposedly spiked: mask proponents think masks are a loophole.</p>
<p>(As I keep saying: if you think COVID is just that deadly, why are you betting your safety on a piece of cloth that is likely not even graded for that purpose?)</p>
<p>Then, they get mad when someone else tries to find a loophole (wearing non-standard masks, not wearing them "correctly", medical reasons for not wearing one, etc.)</p>

        <p>You've abstracted this issue beyond the point of all usefulness, to the extent that you view wearing a mask and not wearing a mask as equivalent "loopholes." I'm starting to think this sub hates the concept of a concrete, causal, external reality.</p>

        <p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>I didn't say not wearing a mask is a loophole.</p>
<p>I continue to assert that anyone who concurrently holds the beliefs that a.) COVID is exceptionally dangerous and b.) that masks are somehow a magic barrier that prevents it (which, by the way most manufacturers <em>explicitly</em> will tell you they don't) is an absolute lunatic that thinks they hold the key to being able to not have to lock down.</p>
<p>If you believe you need a mask, you're better off staying home.  </p>
<p>That is them thinking they found a loophole, and are <em>pissed to no end</em> that everyone who is lax about their particular loophole is loopholing them better.   Because they're the ones that are "good", you see, and everyone else is a misbehaving child that needs a spanking.</p>
<p>If that's abstract to you, I don't know what to tell you.</p>

        <p>Well, Puerto Rico still has a mask mandate and we gotta be home by 9pm. The recent executive order brought police roadblocks where if you were with another person in your car, you had to somehow prove they were part of your immediate family. </p>

        <p>I‘ve realized some time ago that most people only care about their own well-being in the current situation and don’t really think about the future or society as a whole. You need to be somewhat idealistic and take personal sacrifices if you step up against the mainstream narrative in many cases, i.e. losing your job and friends, your kids getting problems in school etc. 
Most people aren’t willing to take these sacrifices and think „as long as the situation is okay for me personally at the moment, it‘s not really worth it“. What they don’t realize is that in long-term, the situation is getting worse and worse and someday they will wake up in a truly dystopian world questioning themselves „how did this happen?“ It’s because the establishment changes the society in small steps over time and people don’t step up as long as the changes are too small to influence their life significantly.</p>

        <p>I never wear a mask and I have yet to be "shamed." I honestly don't know what people are so afraid of. Plus, if the majority of people who publicly support masks are privately against them, then you know that most of the public shaming would be fake anyway. And even if it were genuine shaming, I'd rather be a lone wolf and a freebird than a servile sheep with sheeple friends. Fuck that.</p>

        <p>I never wear a mask in outdoor spaces and will now be even more adamant to doing so now that I know asymptomatic or whatever don't spread the virus as easily as once thought. Indoors, if businesses require it I have no issue doing so, but will limit my time as much as possible with it on. The mask thing I generally don't have too much of an issue with honestly. The lockdowns and vaccines is where true insanity comes to play</p>

        <p>I swear I live in the mask capital of the world (Richmond BC, look up the demographic and you'll understand why). It's all mandatory masks indoors here but that doesn't stop these fruitloops from wearing them pretty much any chance they get. I think at least 75% of people I see driving their car or randomly walking alone outside are wearing masks. These idiots probably wear them in the shower. I bet they're just giddy that their bizarre chinese custom of wearing surgical masks in public is mainstream right now. As much as I hate it I'll still wear one in stores for the convenience of shopping, but you better believe that my nose isn't covered and that I rip that thing off the second I'm out the door. My toddler doesn't wear one when she's with me either. I'll still go into stores without a mask if I forget it though (which happens a lot, because wearing a surgical mask isn't a habit of mine) and I've only once had a clerk ask me to put one on. Usually I say how I can't wait to move back to the US but it actually sounds like the mandates are even worse in a lot of states there right now.</p>

        <p>The headgame is turns out to be literally nothing once you actually start doing it. There's no smarmy soyboys waiting to pounce they mostly look defeated, the karens basically glare. If somebody talks to you, you have an opportunity to calmly explain why masks don't even work and you're exempt. Don't get freaked out people, the social media videos are not normal.</p>

        <p>I think you might be misstating that. There is a difference between fear of being shamed, and wanting to make other people comfortable. One is selfish, and the other is gentlemanly.</p>
<p>If you are a man, you may have been in the situation where you cross the street at night to avoid walking too near a young lady, because you don't want to scare her. I think that's a closer parallel.</p>

        <p>Out of genuine curiosity, do you completely disregard any data from every part of the globe that hospitals are running out of ICU room for this? There’s clinical studies and tons of scientific evidence that mask to mask transmission is incredibly low. I don’t mean to sound rude but do you just completely ignore science and all the hard work scientist and doctors do? I unfortunately have had family friends and known quite a few people to pass from this and seeing your comments show that people like you and the mindset you have are probably causing more deaths than necessary.</p>

        <p>I am sorry for your loss. A few family friends have been in great health that have passed due to COVID. It is not the flu. Your comment clearly indicates your lack of research on the current state of what this is and what is stressing our healthcare systems. </p>
<p>Also, you can not trust those sources (I don’t blame you) and still look at medical research and scientific papers. Opinions don’t matter that much when there is hard science and evidence. </p>
<p>And honestly, yes, whether you prefer it or not, us at the bottom are in it together. That’s why it’s not that difficult for me to do something as simple as wear a mask so that maybe I don’t make someone else’s life more difficult because of my own selfishness. This isn’t virtue signaling, it’s literally just trying to be a decent human being. </p>

        <p>I actually wear a mask because I’m afraid of getting this virus. I know, 99% survival rate, so on... but survival rate doesn’t account for infection rate. Being infected with COVID-19 makes for a miserable rest of your life in some cases. It would impact me in many ways. Especially as an avid athlete, a disease that targets the respiratory system is one of my worst nightmares - if my lungs get damaged, I may never be able to play my sport again, and certainly not at the level I do right now. Not to mention decreased spermatogenesis, permanent organ damage, permanent brain damage, and all the other baggage that comes along with COVID-19. It’s not the virus itself you need to be worried about. It’s what the virus leads to that’s even more concerning. I’m willing to sacrifice my freedoms now so that I can keep them later in life.</p>

        <p>Thanks for being honest. The mask doesn't protect you though, it has been shown many times. It may limit communal spread if worn by infected people.</p>
<p>The side effects are very rare and usually go away with time. Several of my country's top athletes were reported having the virus, and I don't expect any of them dropping out of sports.</p>
<p>Some of the side effects you mention are on the level of conspiracy theories. Remember The Science?</p>

        <p>Morbidity is a well known effect, and not a common one either (IFR is around 0.5% on average). The problem with side effects is that they are very unspecific, observed with other viral infections, and the statistics is practically absent, so they can't really be used as a scare tactics. Saying that many effects are "still unknown" is just plain stupid, one could claim the same about vaccines and give ammo to the anti-vaxxers.</p>

        <p>Oh, yes, the science. I almost forgot. Here are some peer-reviewed articles from some of the most well-respected journals in the life sciences and medicine:</p>
<p>Long Term Effects of COVID-19: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6 and https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/brain-fog-heart-damage-covid-19-s-lingering-problems-alarm-scientists</p>
<p>Brain Damage: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2008597</p>
<p>Organ Damage: https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/how-does-coronavirus-kill-clinicians-trace-ferocious-rampage-through-body-brain-toes and https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2015432</p>
<p>This is after a quick search, I tried to find the most relevant papers to back my claims. I think a few of them will not have pay walls (I have free access to them through my employer).</p>
<p>Also a few auxiliary things to point out: 1) Masks do not directly prevent infection: they indirectly prevent it. In fact, limiting community spread is a form of protection, so I don’t even need to argue that point because you made the exact point you were trying to disprove! 2) Just because you don’t expect top athletes to drop out of sports is not an adequate enough assessment of the situation. Unless you have access to their medical records, how would you know what their health condition is? As the papers I attached above show, some injuries improve, but most do not. It is actually more likely that over time, some top athletes will have to cut their careers short because of the long term effects. Thank you for reminding me about the science, enjoy your reading material (seriously, read it so you can be a more informed individual, your current level of understanding is mediocre bordering on nonexistent).</p>

        <p>Some statistics would put that in a different light. What is sorely missing from your references is the prevalence of the long term effects. You know what a very well documented long-term outcome from Covid-19 is? Death. However, just like the fear porn you try to dress up in sciency quotes, it is very uncommon.</p>

        <p>Your inability to understand the science is not a good reason to reject it. By the way, these articles do include some statistics. None of them are solidified because this virus has been around for a year and long terms effects sometimes don’t appear for a while. So unless you have a DeLorean hooked up to a flux capacitor and 1.21 GW of power, you’re essentially asking for something that nobody on the planet knows for sure right now, but present data indicate that it is an issue that will grow over time. Science constantly changes, updates, improves, adds, and revolutionizes. I know you want data, but it takes time.</p>

        <p>Do you see how providing a source makes your comment significantly more believable and trustworthy? This is good.</p>
<p>Now, with regards to the data: this is actually pretty close to what I expect. But, as I mentioned previously, long term effects of COVID will take time to develop. We may not see these for years. And since these data show that people 15-35 have the highest rate of infection, and current data suggests that long term effects exist, this is an age group that needs to be watched closely.</p>

        <p>Yes. I am. You said there is no “the science”. That’s denialism. The sources I chose (Nature, JAMA, NEJM, etc. are some of the most respected journals in the field) - I would say it’s surprising you haven’t heard of them, but then again, you’re not a scientist, so this doesn’t come as a surprise. I picked articles that support my argument, cherry picking is when you use fraudulent or inaccurate data to bias an outcome. All the journal articles were peer-reviewed. So yeah, actually, I can simply add science and make my argument correct because science isn’t magic. It’s truth. Like I mentioned before, your inability to understand the science is not a good reason to refute it.</p>

        <p>no dude, here's this. MY "science" that I look at is actual data. Studies. not articles. And your articles are what I said they are, they are specific examples of sob stories. All I need to see is the hospitalization rates and the deaths rates for people my age. You know, data. I understand that there is inherent risk in living life and that every day can be your last. Every time you step in to a car you can get into an accident and die. Every day that you are alive can be your last. I choose to live life to the fullest, while you hunker down in your basement because you read a sob story about something not proven. There is tons of articles that say that the risk to our age group for anything is close to 0. And btw, "science" isn't just whatever fear you can find an article to support. Scientists find different things from each other all the time, it's their job. Once you find something, the scientific community works to disprove it, over and over and over again until it becomes obvious it can't, and that's why everyone knows the earth is round and no scientist refutes it. It takes years for a theory to become fact. So don't talk to me about not "understanding the science" because their is no "the science" science is not one belief.</p>

        <p>Science is not belief at all. It is objective consensus -  belief has absolutely nothing to do with it. Data only means something once you’ve extracted patterns, raw numbers themselves usually don’t mean much. It’s your problem if you can’t deal with what’s being reported by scientists who study things like COVID-19 for a living. And the fact that you think you can go out and live your life to the fullest every day means you’re selfish and you don’t care about the fact that you engaging in risky behaviors puts others in danger. You fit the definition for bioterrorism. Trust me, I want to live it up too, but traveling and doing things that may expose others to COVID-19 is neither safe nor practical right now. By the way, stop with this whole hunkering down in my basement because I work 6 days a week on-site and I don’t have a basement. Since I’ve concluded you cannot be reasoned with, I’m going to leave you with this: branch out and explore the space. Ask your doctor or your friends in the sciences what they think. Because they all know better than you do. I know you’ll never listen to me even though I have two degrees in the life sciences because I represent a disturbance to the comforting worldview you’ve engineered to keep you isolated from reality, but if you ask someone even more qualified than I am, I can guarantee the answer won’t change much. I can only educate you so much over Reddit, you’d do well to solicit this info from people more accessible to you. But do me a favor, when someone does eventually tell you what I have, don’t make it their problem. That kind of attitude isn’t gonna get you very far and it’s gonna make you a lot of enemies. You’re lucky we’re only on Reddit so you get to test drive your indecency without consequences, but something tells me you’re not so different in real life. You have much deeper issues than your denial of science and I don’t need a degree to figure that out.</p>

        <p>lmao... that whole rant and nothing made sense. now your argument is that i'm selfish, a stark contrast to your previous argument which was that covid was dangerous and I should be worried about myself. I showed data that it isn't dangerous to people like me, which is what we've known for months. You can call me a "science denier" because I don't think your sob story articles are very relevant to me and my own life, as well as using the CLASSIC "you have issues/seek help" when someone disagrees with your logic. You never said how common those severe cases are, because you know the answer is "very rare" and that hurts your case.</p>

        <p>I wear masks cause I dont want to catch the virus. The virus is still a rather unknown virus, if the virus doesnt kill us, we still dont know the long term effects of the virus. We do know it does have adverse effect on many parts of our body other than the lung, e.g. our cardio vascular system, intestines, nervous system. For all we know it could cause cancer in the future, it could cause us to die much earlier for many different reasons. It could reduce our quality of life if it causes a chronic illness. Its a novel virus, and as with most viruses all we can do is to observe how it could affect our body, i for one would prefer to not be that guinea pig.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I guess saying it straight out would probably be "does masks protect the wearer, well it depends". There are studies which show that mask do in fact protect the wearer. At the very minimum it at least protect others incase they have it. Thats good enough reasons for me to wear. The covid numbers has spiked pretty much in my town now, it its depressing that people can actually contiue relativly normal just following simple measures, keep 1 m distance to other, wear mask, and down touch your face. its a small price to pay.</p>

        <p>Just because you and your friends and family don't care about other people doesn't mean everyone else is equally as selfish. I wear a surgical mask over my N/P95/100 because it has a valve, and I want people to feel safe, despite the fact that the chances I have of COVID are practically nil because I only leave my house once a week  (I'd be doing this regardless of covid).</p>
<p>I'm not wearing a mask because I'm afraid what people will think of me, but I do want them to feel safe around me. If I did, I probably wouldn't have dropped out of college, spent years trying to build a business when people told me I was going to fail, become vegan, semi-retired at 26 (5-10 hrs of work per week), and moved into a small cottage in the mountains instead of living the "normal" life most people wanted me to.</p>
<p>There's no point in projecting your own moral failings onto others. It's not going to help you. But I do commend you on being honest about your own shortcomings. And I will say that what you're saying isn't categorically false — there are a large portion of people who are exactly as you describe.</p>
<p>EDIT: Real advice: surround yourself with better people who actually care about others. There's no point in having friends who don't care about you (you're another person, after all). My close friends are all genuinely concerned about how they'll affect other people, and in our private conversations, they say they are <em>far</em> more concerned about transmitting covid to other people than getting it themselves. They know they'll likely get over it just fine.</p>

        <p>I actually do wear it with a sense of responsibility and respect for others, in hopes of doing my part in a legitimate collective effort. I think a lot of people do. But then I also happily pay my taxes without being a little bitch about it or trying to pay as little as possible.</p>
<p>You can whine about others' selfishness--and indeed it has been disheartening to see so many people who can't be bothered to make the most trivial of efforts for the common good--but it's no more noble to be selfish <em>just because</em> others are.</p>

        <p>Because they are hypocrites. They think they own the moral high ground, but in reality they are selfish, cowards, and fools. We should call them out every chance we get, unfortunately we don't get many chances, because the fascists actively silence us when they can. </p>
<p>It's uncouth for them to be reminded that they are destroying culture, hospitality, education, human progress in the third world. They wish to make believe that there was never any other way, and that everyone agreed to the insanity they've brought upon the world, so it's disconcerting for them to hear people who disagree.</p>

        <p>The problem is, some people’s “opinion” is not founded with any actual knowledge on a subject than actually leads to the unnecessary death of friends and relatives for others. So some opinions are objectively worse than others.</p>

        <p>Wow, I'd really like to know when the human race evolved seemingly overnight to care THAT MUCH for every single human life that we were willing to completely distrust our own feelings and opinions. Thank God we can finally see an end to all death and suffering to all people! The irony is, if one truly cared for other humans, we'd leave them and their opinions alone would we not? But I get it, if their opinions interfere in any possible way with your agenda, or don't meet YOUR standard and definition of knowledge (irrespective of where you found this knowledge) , suddenly you take away their right to have their own opinion that should be left alone. That sounds oddly familiar with the current state of affairs doesn't it?</p>

        <p>I think we can all agree that PhD’s in areas of biology/virology probably fits an objective standard of knowledge. You might be one, I’m not sure, we’ve never met. I can assume by the way you’re commenting that you do not have a PhD related to anything medical. </p>
<p>What bums me out the most, is that there is still a whole generation (veterans) who had no choice but to go fight and risk their lives...and the generations under them are so terrified of literally wearing a mask in public that it puts their lives again in jeopardy. </p>
<p>I can’t imagine having no choice but to put my life on the line and then years later the MOST that is asked of later generations is to wear a mask so that the older age groups and most at risk don’t have to worry about their lives or their spouses. But hey, if wearing a mask scares you that much, I get it. I would hate to look like I’ve done any research and used actual data from actual professionals that have spent a lifetime studying this stuff.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for saying this!</p>
<p>These anti-mask people talk about the mask as if it's the biggest issue. Mask wearing is not an issue to me. If more people just put their damn masks on and stopped looking for conspiracies, we would have fewer shut downs and the economy would be able to start the recovery process. </p>
<p>They're are mad about masks, when they should be mad that our governments SAW this coming and did not prepare appropriately. No safeguards were put in place for the inevitable job losses. </p>
<p>But no. Instead of railing against the people who are ACTUALLY benefitting from all of this (huge corporations taking small business bailouts, etc.), they're looking for some knifey shiv-dark, non-existent conspiracy. </p>
<p>The conspiracy is in plain sight. Those with wealth and power WANT us to be fighting with each other instead of holding them responsible for their inaction and immoral dealings having to do with COVID. And we're doing exactly what they want.</p>

<p>Masks don’t really have much ability to really hurt us accept for the fact that facial expressions are key in empathy.</p>
<p>But we talk about it endlessly because it was the only thing we actually had a choice on. No one asked me if I wanted to shut down my industry. </p>

        <p>Yep. We’re pretty diligent in my household about wearing masks, and so is my neighborhood, but we still somehow caught it.

<p>Yes, Sweden. Lower communal spread and better outcomes than many countries with strict mask mandates.</p>
<p>No masks and yet cases declined significantly in the summer. Came back strong during winter, but still no masks, and it's already slowing down.</p>

        <p>You’re right- totally would have made sense to switch to 30 day view, duh. It’s still significantly more than when they had their blip in the summer. Masks and social distancing can prevent more cases. Even the leaders in Sweden are imposing more restrictions because they realized their error. </p>
<p>So cases are on the rise, and masks help prevent the spread of the coronavirus... why shouldn’t they wear them? Are you arguing that masks don’t do anything, or do you just not like being told what to do? I’m really struggling with the logic here, I’m not even trying to be douchey here.</p>

        <p>Look at places with mask mandates. The USA is a dumpster fire. How many people wear masks in NYC?</p>
<p>Nobody mandates masks in Sweden, and the final outcome after the winter will be better than the USA, Italy, UK, Spain, etc, just like it was after the summer.</p>

        <p>Did you ever consider that it was getting better but then people got too comfortable and threw 300+ events where no one wore masks or practiced social distancing so it came back?</p>
<p>Because New York was doing well during the summer. They stomped their cases down, and then we start hearing about people ignoring protocol because ‘it’s just the flu, guys’. And the cases go back up. </p>
<p>Sweden may not have had a mandate, but they still asked their citizens to social distance and stay home. They also were not hit as hard as other countries, from the beginning - meaning they didn’t have a boatload of cases that they had to control. And Travel had been stopped in the EU so there weren’t any new cases coming in. I wouldn’t use Sweden as your prime example as to why you don’t want to wear masks.</p>

<p>That's patently untrue. Sweden literally had boatloads (well, airplanes) of infected carriers after the skiing vacation in February-March, and was hit the hardest of all Nordic countries largely because of that. This is well documented.</p>
<p>I am not very well acquainted with other countries that do not mandate masks. I am well aware that many countries that do are not dealing very well with the pandemic though.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say they weren’t hit, I said they weren’t hit as hard.</p>
<p>And actually, if you want to take the other Nordic countries and compare their graphs, then the rate of infection decreases during those summer months, whereas in Sweden they stay pretty much the same. Couldn’t that be attributed to a lack of masks?</p>

        <p>The rate of infection was negligible during the summer in Sweden. Sweden used to be high up in the list of European countries by mortality from Covid-19 until the summer. When the summer came, the situation became reversed.</p>
<p>Two major phenomena drive this pandemic, seasonality and herd immunity. Human behavior is a distant third at best.</p>

        <p>Nah, no scientists or doctors for the Swedes. I’m joking, in case that wasn’t obvious. </p>
<p>But I think I’ll go with what the majority of scientists say. I’m sure some Swedish scientists also agree that masks are important.</p>
