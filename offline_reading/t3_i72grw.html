<p>I'm a Republican and I'm a Trump supporter, but this make me not want to vote for him in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>You letting those abuse the system/lazy sit on the couch give them 1K a week (at least 4K a month). But those essensial workers have to wear a mask and work full time making miminum wage. Nurses that have to deal with covid patients. Hell, I'm sure those janitor in the hospital would love to sit on their butt and collect unemployment.</p>
<p>If you going to enable those folks like that then I suggest you give the $600 to essensial workers too. If you don't then cut unemployment to whatever their wages was pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Ridiculously entitlement, especially in low cost living states, who work make $5 an hour minimum wage, now sit on their butt collecting 4K a month. Tell that to those essensial workers who still working $5 minimum wage out there while you sit on your butt.</p>
<p>I support unemployment, but I support it at of whatever your wages was pre-covid. Unemployment is not a luxury.</p>
<p>I don't like the Demorats and their trillions and trillions dollars request, but Trump is no better if he support such government free handouts system.</p>
<p>note: Not saying all, there are those who truly need the unemployment. But here I'm talking about those who ABUSE the system. Like the ones who I know was bragging that they work under the table to make extra while collecting MAX unemployment (which is over 1K a week). And someone I know who still working part time but still collecting these unemployment handouts.</p></p>

        <p>I'm 100% with you on this.  Trump keeps caving in to the radical democrats.   Lazy/cowards don't deserve $600+ per week!  Essential workers do!  People who stay home should only be paid by the state or they need to get a job.</p>

        <p>1000% agree these handouts are completely
unfair. Essential workers need to get paid too. It’s not right that people are getting paid more to sit at home.</p>

        <p>All the minimum wage or close enough people at my store are “risking getting the deadliest virus of all time” and yet people are getting paid MORE to sit at home with less “risk”? </p>
<p>Even from the other side’s perspective, it doesn’t seem fair.</p>

        <p>I'd only support policies that encourage getting people to work without putting burdden on the taxpayers.  Like lower taxes.</p>

        <p>I want no flat bonus, period. Raise unemployment benefits in low-percentage states temporarily to something like 80% of previous wages or 80% of median income in their area, whichever is lower. Maybe up to 90% of previous income for very low-wage workers. They can fuck off with the "it's too hard to calculate" excuse now - I don't care, you've had <em>months</em> to get a software dev team to take care of it.</p>
<p>Even a $400 bonus above regular unemployment puts nearly all unemployed people at higher earnings than entry-level workers. Better than $600 extra for doing nothing but it still stinks.</p>
<p>&rt;Under the memorandum, the federal government would require states to pick up the tab for 25% (or $100) of the $400 additional benefit each person may able to receive weekly in additional aid -- an initiative that was immediately criticized by several governors because of how financially strapped many states are due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Boo hoo. Guess you'll have to open back up for business and stop making people so miserable that the ones with the means to do so are leaving.</p>

        <p>Neither party supports reality, they all want power, approval and lockdowns.</p>
<p>It's heinous. Trump's an idiot, and he is no conservative in any way, shape, or form. The idea he'd protect liberty is laughable.</p>
