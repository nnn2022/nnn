        <p>They want you to think that they can do it all, yes.</p>
<p>However, they cannot engineer a virus that is both very lethal and very contagious.</p>
<p>It is simply not possible. When it kills the hosts and stops transmitting, the game is over.</p>
<p>This is why there isn't ever an ebola pandemic.</p>
<p>However, when you get people so scared that they will lie down and let themselves be injected with the bio-weapon, the gates of hell are wide open.</p>
<p>If they could kill everyone, they would have already done so. They would have done a nuclear war decades ago. In the end, it simply does not work that way.</p>
<p>However, the evil intent and agenda are real and they will push as much as they can.</p>
<p>But can only push as much as we let them. What they really want is for people to internalize their rule. Defiance is freedom. Fear is slavery.</p>

        <p>While you're right about there being a lethality/contagious hurtle for virus design, you're assuming that they won't (or aren't already) actively releasing said deadly virus on an on going basis instead of all at once. If there is a continuous effort to contaminate different parts of the world they they can fake it until they make it.</p>

        <p>The timeline cannot be all that fast, however. They have been killing us for decades already. It is always a slow affair. They are ultimately parasites and also live on this world and off of us. When they kill so many so suddenly that society collapses, then it is game over for them, too. Who will run their armies and police forces? Who will operate their nuclear power plants? Who will produce their commerce and food?</p>
<p>Not everything can be automated yet and this depopulation agenda, NWO, technocracy, etc. will not come into place overnight. If anything, it was already too rushed at this point. Backstabbing from within the arcanum of power is certainly a possible outcome. In the end, we might end up with a globalism of no governments (but a shadow one) and achieve much more individual freedom than ever before.</p>
<p>Nothing is set in stone. Human culture will always be changeable by humans.</p>

        <p>This is the summarized version that I got April 2020. With all the censorship going on I can barely find the real version anymore. However , I can tell you I did find it on the Rockefeller group website and read it. They have 4 scenarios.</p>
