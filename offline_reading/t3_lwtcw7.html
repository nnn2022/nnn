<p><strong>Juicy Bits:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Marie-France Boudret, who works in a French home for the elderly, watched a patient suffocate to death in front of her because COVID-19 had infected his lungs. But when her employer offered her a vaccine against the virus, the nurse hesitated.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“I have some doubts,” said Boudret, 48. “I prefer to wait.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Around half of health workers in French care homes do not want to be vaccinated, according to the group of experts guiding the state’s vaccine rollout - compared to only 20% of the residents who have not been inoculated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; “There’s a complete loss of trust,” she said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The issue is not unique to France.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In Germany, care home operator BeneVit Group surveyed staff in November and found only 30% wanted to get vaccinated.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Peter Burri, head of ProSenectute, Switzerland’s biggest advocacy group for seniors, said at most half of nursing staff in the medical sector were willing to get inoculated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Propaganda and Misinformation:</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; If significant numbers of care home workers do not get the jab, <strong><em>they could transmit the disease to residents</em></strong> who are not vaccinated and at high risk of serious illness, say advocates for the elderly. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; Regulators around the world have repeatedly said <strong><em>speed will not compromise safety and vaccine developers have said they will not cut corners in testing for safety and efficacy.</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The quicker results have stemmed from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence and can take years.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Trials for the shots developed by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson have shown <strong><em>only temporary side-effects.</em></strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; France’s state <strong><em>drug safety watchdog has said the procedure for approving the vaccines ensures they are safe and that it monitors side-effects and has seen nothing to warrant stopping their use.</em></strong> </p>
