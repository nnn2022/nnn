    <strong>We need to STOP with these preposterous, unfounded claims that a certain beloved Hollywood actor's (who shall remain nameless) recent heart-problems have ANYTHING at all to do with the experimental vaccine!! IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE!!</strong>
    <p><p>Look, just because he had the heckin' jabs which are known to cause blood clots and heart problems doesn't fucking mean that's why he's all of a sudden collapsed due to heart problems. Honestly, the fact that you people jumped right to the vaccines as the cause proves you're brainwashed and paranoid; it's not like the jabs are being shoved down your throat every fucking second of every fucking day through propaganda or like we're seeing countless first-hand posts on social media, anecdotal accounts from friends and family members of loved ones and people in our personal lives dealing with adverse effects that line right the fuck up with what's happened to this particular actor!!</p>
<p>Never mind the fact that this actor was perfectly healthy and in the best shape of his life after filming an action movie a few months prior! IT'S HOT ON THE SET OF THE SHOW HE'S WORKED ON FOR WELL OVER A DECADE NOW WITHOUT INCIDENT. It was probably heat stroke that caused the heart problems that they're being incredibly vague about!! Ignore all the comments and posts getting deleted and censored claiming otherwise!! </p>
<p>THEY'RE ALL ANTI-VAX REPUBLICAN(!) CONSPIRACY THEORISTS SPINNING THEIR NEFARIOUS, RUSSIAN AGENDA!! OMG, STOP MAKING THIS POLITICAL!!</p>
<p>It is completely LUDICROUS to even speculate that the highly experimental, rushed jibby-jab that does fuck all but put your health at risk could have anything to do with this man's health being put at risk. END OF FUCKING DISCUSSION!!!</p></p>

        <p>For some reason mentioning He Who Shall Not Be Named really touched a nerve with a lot of people yesterday!</p>
<p>Thing is? I think a lot of people are having internal conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are beginning to feel the long term side effects.</li>
<li>They are tired. Out of breath unexpectedly.</li>
<li>They feel "brain fog" and keep getting that "word on the tip of the tongue" feeling.</li>
<li>They're having an increasingly difficult time expressing themselves coherently.</li>
<li>They're beginning to struggle with the complexities of seemingly simple every day tasks.</li>
<li>They're unable to focus for any duration of time.</li>
<li>They're having headaches.</li>
<li>Their hearts are skipping beats &amp; stuttering.</li>
<li>They feel a general sense of malaise.</li>
</ul>
<p>We see this in posts and hear it in conversation -- and these are the people with the self-awareness and confidence to speak openly about it.</p>
<p>I suspect this is happening to far more of the vaccinated and they are getting irritable and angry at the thought that it might be from the vaccine that they chose to take on their own volition...</p>
<p>Because that means, in the end, that they did it to themselves.</p>
<p>So instead they dig deeper and deeper into denial and rage, which is then directed at us.</p>
<p>Give it time. The long-term side effects will emerge and we will be vindicated for our intelligent decision to abstain from unproven experimental injections.</p>

        <p>My concern is what happens this winter. If ADE shows up in a large scale (like it has in every prior attempt to make a coronavirus vaccine), then the side effects of the Vax will include a lot of people dying of coronaviruses. The bitter irony is that we might see the mass deaths they've been predicting, but it won't be the unvaxed, and the consequences of the cognitive dissonance as that hits that will likely make 2020 look sane....</p>

        <p>Don't forget, previous attempts at mRNA vaccines (pre covid) resulted in severe ADEs for the vaccinated when <strong>re-exposed to the live virus.</strong></p>
<p>Here's my working hypothesis. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As I understand, increased transmissibility in viruses USUALLY is associated with decreased severity. This is the virus adapting to the host, because the virus can't survive if it kills off the entire host population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the known historical issues of mRNA vaccines attempts (before COVID) was what happened when the vaccinated population was RE-introduced to the virus. In clinical studies, this resulted in massive ADEs and even death. Like the covered-up ferret study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccinated population had a limited range in which the vaccine was supposed to cover (i.e., target the spike protein). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus has begun mutating to get around the very tailored and limited immunity provided by the vaccine targeting only the spike protein, not other elements of the virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This vaccinated population is now being re-introduced to a variation of the virus that has been and is adapting to bypass the defense provided by the spike protein immunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This re-introduction to the wild virus may cause the same results as the early clinical trials on mRNA vaccines: increased ADEs and death in the vaccinated population.</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>I'm worried about the same thing, or similar at least. Is ADE different from "Pathogenic Priming?"</p>

        <p>"Pathogenic Priming" and ADE are very similar, but the differences, while subtle, is quite important. Pathogenic Priming is when a vaccine causes the body to produce harmful antibodies to the virus the vaccine is supposed to protect against. This makes exposure to that virus much more dangerous, but once that virus is gone, Pathogenic Priming is not an issue, since it is only that virus that causes those antibodies. This means the risk of it from these vaccines lasts for a couple of years at most, since coronaviruses mutate so quickly.</p>
<p>ADE, Antibody Dependent Enhancement, is where the vaccine makes infection by other, related viruses worse. Exactly why it happens is unclear, but there are plenty of theories. The most bizarre data point though, is that it emerges in almost, if not every attempt to make a coronavirus vaccine, but is basically unheard of outside of this field. Given this, the fact that Pfizer outright says they don't know if this is a risk (page 52 of the EUA: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download</a>), and Covid cases are spiking in areas with high vaccination rates, I think it's worth considering the possibility these vaccines induce ADE.</p>
<p>And in previous coronavirus vaccine trials, ADE usually never went away. So it's possible that for the rest of their lives, everyone who took the vax will need to treat every coronavirus like they currently treat Covid: severely life threatening, but lots of people can get it and spread it with very mild symptoms, and literally everywhere.</p>

        <p>Thank you! I knew about this but I didn't know what it was called, and now I do. I appreciate your detailed explanation!!!</p>
<p>Yes this is a HUGE concern. I believe it IS a thing and I think it's why they want it in everyone. You can imagine the profit &amp; control potential with it...</p>
<p>I believe my family just had (and got over) the "delta variant." </p>
<p>My father-in-law's (fully vaccinated) wife went to Mexico. Came back with something that matched symptoms... Then he (fully vaccinated) got it. He came over to the house to show off his new Porsche. Coughing. Sneezing. Snotting.</p>
<p>My whole family got sick (except my wife who didn't.) Our symptoms matched the description perfectly, and they say it's highly contagious so... Man, I think we had it.</p>
<p>But everyone's better now and it just wasn't that big of a deal. My 13 year old had it the worst. He had some fever and a cough.</p>
<p>Anyhow the point here is --- whatever this is was brought to us by "fully vaccinated" people.</p>
<p>I've also noticed a lot of people who got vaccinated ended up getting this "variant" (which I personally think is just this year's "common cold." But it was, indeed, as contagious as they say.)</p>
<p>Anyhow ... I would rather fight this off naturally than have god-knows-what injected into me.</p>
<p>I got through it, and I'm feeling on top of the world now!</p>
<p>Anyhow thanks again for the info. I needed to know what that was called and now I do!</p>

        <p>I did some training on how to identify early symptoms of dementia, and quite a few people I know who took the vax are showing signs of it. I hope they have a full recovery, but if not, and this is happening on a large scale, basically every social service in most of the world will be overwhelmed very soon: imagine the disaster if even just 1% of people who took the vax develop dementia in the next few years.....</p>

        <p>I'm glad you're able to maintain your friendship during this. It's very difficult for me.
To me it's like a line in the sand has been drawn... And on one hand it feels like I'm the crazy one to feel that way except --- I'm not asking change of anyone!</p>
<p>But these people -- these "friends" are turning me into the "extremist" because I have crazy views like wanting choice in regard to experimental medical procedures.</p>
<p>So it feels like about 90% of my friends have joined something that feels like the Nazi party. I know it's not exactly the same (yet) but it it's getting to that level of extremity.</p>
<p>I mean... The nazi party had to start somewhere, and I'm sure it ramped up over time.</p>
<p>Anyhow... The brain fog thing is really concerning. Scary damn times...</p>

        <p>Yep I can confirm the brain fog. I’ve noticed the past few days that words just disappear from my mind mid sentence. Couldn’t recall the word if I tried. I’ve been prone to tripping over my sentences and forgetting a word or two momentarily every so often throughout my life but this is starting to worry me. I’m sure the r/covidvaccinated crowd would tell me it’s all in my head (the irony).</p>
<p>My first shot was 3 weeks ago and I thought I got lucky as one of the few unaffected. I guess maybe not. I’m 19😬. I’ll make my peace with this whatever way it goes but fuck.</p>

        <p>Are you serious? </p>
<p>If you're serious and not just trolling -- man, that's scary. Listen -- some doctors are saying the shots are cumulative, like Dr. Charles Hoffe. </p>
<p>I wouldn't get another.</p>
<p>They're already talking about a 3rd shot for people so once you go down this path with these people it never.</p>
<p>You're 19 man. Look up the CDC provisional death counts. Keep in mind we're a nation of 331 MILLION people.</p>
<p>You know how many Covid-19 deaths in 2020 of people under 25? 721. I kid you not. Look up the numbers at CDC.</p>
<p>721.</p>
<p>So you don't need this, man. Just take care of yourself and dodge this bullet.</p>
<p>And if years down the line it turns out all these side effects online were made up? Great. Take it then.</p>
<p>But there's no need to rush into this experiment because bad people are telling you to.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>Hey there man, promise I’m not trolling! Been part of this community for over a year. I’m sorry to say but I caved. I knew what to expect when I went to have it and I feel like I’ve tainted my principles. I’ve divulged in previous comments of mine as to my circumstances so I’ve felt so fucking lost for god knows how long. You’re welcome to pour through my comment history for context. </p>
<p>I’ve actually been wondering about the cumulative effects of the shots so thanks for citing a doctor who’s not been compromised for me to accrue some knowledge on this! </p>
<p>Yep they’re starting the booster (3rd) shots here in the UK as early as September for everyone that had the 1st shot at the start of the year. Fuck knows how that’s not gonna lead to overloading the system.</p>
<p>I know about the CDC 99.997% survival rate but had no clue about the provisional death counts. I’ll see if I can find them easily. It’s no surprise considering absolutely no one I know has been even mildly affected by this. </p>
<p>Thanks for the well wishes though :)</p>

        <p>The shots (among other effects like death and blood clots, heart impacts) are designed to damage the blood brain barrier, it's been the goal for decades,  and starts now at birth with 'vitamin k' injections. This will give neuro diseases to younger and younger victims. Look into remedies to restore the bbb, if you want to help yourself, like resveratrol, quercetin, etc</p>

        <p>Bob Odenkirk. He plays Saul Goodman on <em>Breaking Bad</em> and <em>Better Call Saul</em>. Collapsed on set a couple days ago and for a whole day the media was cryptic until they revealed it was a heart related problem. Absolutely nothing else has been said apart from his son saying he’s okay. Bryan Cranston even posted praying for his recovery. All kinda points to one thing doesn’t it?</p>
