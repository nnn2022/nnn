    <p><p>Less rights for the people, more for the state. Less money for the people, more for the state. Neighbors snitching on each other, communities self-policing, citizens enjoying watching other citizens being abused by authorities for "wrongspeak" or "wrongthink".</p>
<p>It's just kind of funny how we're slowly slipping into authoritarian communism, just like the China and the CCP, but no way could China have released this virus in an attempt to further solidify their control over the western world (which they already own).</p></p>
