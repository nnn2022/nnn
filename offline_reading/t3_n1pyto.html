    <strong>This is the first day of my country's 18 day lockdown and people are protesting the ban of the alcoholic beverages during the lockdown instead of the actual lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>Turkey, being a retarded country it is, banned sale of any alcoholic beverages during lockdown and people are vocal about it on twitter and on other social medias. 
I don't know if you heard but government of Turkey is one of the least helpful ones since the beginning of this thing, according to the IMF. Government forcefully closed shops but kept malls open, only to ban sitting inside for drinking or eating, while letting people shop for clothing. Actual retardism. There has been no help, NONE for your average Turk. Not a single cent. </p>
<p>They had announced this 17 day lockdown 3 days before it started and the ignorant population is only complains about the ban of alcoholic drinks (which is dumb of course) and fail to realize banning of it is the same as forcing people to stay at home.
It's putting a limit to one's freedom.</p></p>

        <p>Moroccan here! I thought I understood that Erdogan's turkey had rather financially favored Turkish citizens, and that your country's economy had taken off. i had a lot of respect for your president because he seemed independent and anti nwo to me, but if turkey is part of the plandemic, i will definitely reconsider my opinion on erdogan.<em>ðŸ“·</em></p>

        <p>Who does not want to drink if they are locked away for two weeks? The ban of your freedom is dumb and only made worse by the ban of alcohol.</p>
