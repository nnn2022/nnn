    <strong>An important Public Service Announcement re: free doughnuts for vaccine jabs</strong>
    <p><p>Here's the deal on the doughnuts.  We know that there is--and should be--a considerable percentage of the population who is reluctant to accept a vaccine, where long-term data on its safety and efficacy are definitionally impossible to come by.  We need that data.  </p>
<p>So here's the deal:  you get the jab, get a doughnut, and in return you agree to let us watch you carefully over the next few months and years.  We use that information to inform researchers how to tweak these compounds in the future.</p>
<p>And that's the deal.  That's all there is to it.  You don't get to sue if you don't like how it turned out.  You don't get to brag on social media platforms that you're anything besides volunteer to be test subjects in a giant experiment--which we all hope turns out very well; fingers crossed--in exchange for a free doughnut.  You don't even get to complain about the free doughnut.<br>
