        <p>For anyone out of the loop, the health department, along with Mette Frederiksen, was caught earlier in the year lying about the "experts" who told her to lock the country down. The State Serum Institute was supposedly the "experts" used to justify the initial lockdown, but they admitted to advising against the lockdown and were told to keep quiet about the real infection rate as it "wasn't politically desirable".</p>

        <p>This is further distraction, the "real" infection numbers are 0, because the flu had a different name this year and was used as a veil for a blatant, further fascism increase, and a very massive one. </p>
<p>The stuff you posted is just simple distraction, with the goal to get you to believe that the beerflu is real, just not as severe as presented, and the politician scum isn't intentionally trying to torment people for their amusement but "just incompetent". Less naive then the mainstream-story but still naive.</p>
