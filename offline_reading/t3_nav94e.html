        <p>I don't understand why people still want to think there is a virus bioweapon, when there is zero evidence it even exists, and nobody is dying of it... Meanwhile, hundreds of millions of gullible fools are being injected with the only REAL bioweapon of mass destruction, the experimental genetic therapy. Pandora's box will come from the needle, not a fake bat.</p>

        <p>I think corona was released from a lab but wasn’t quite as effective as they were hoping because they underestimated the strength of our immune systems.  We had all caught and beat covid pretty much with not much death. Most deaths were because we were already unhealthy and had bad medical advice.  Those that did contract were sent home to fester rather than being treated right away as well.</p>
<p>IF corona was real and it was released from a lab this is  a big deal. It pretty much invalidates everything done from that point to now including the mad rush for vaccination now which seems to be much more worrisome.</p>

        <p>I have news for you: terrain theory invalidates all other nonsense about pandemics by infectious viruses. No need for speculation.</p>
