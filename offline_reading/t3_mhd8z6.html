        <p>The problem is, they could be entirely correct. Correlation is not causation. This could be caused by the vaccine or completely unrelated - not enough info. </p>
<p>The real question is this: after the vaccine was rushed out to the entire population, do you trust the pharmaceutical companies and regulators to investigate such incidences with the same rigor and honesty they would during normal trial phases? </p>
<p>What could they say if such investigations led to significant concerns? “Gee, turns out the adverse effects are too severe and too common, we shouldn’t have pressured the whole world to get injected with this after all.”</p>

        <p>To be fair they aren't wrong but also are. It's the combination of taking tylenol directly after the vaccine. But they sure don't fucking tell you not to take tylenol after vaccines and hundreds of babies are harmed every year. It can happen with other drugs too. I'm not saying it can't happen without the presence of tylenol btw, but that most.known SJS reactions to vaccines, the folks took or were given tylenol</p>

        <p>It’s the fact that it was mere speculation.</p>
<p>Also, plenty of folks taking tylenol with this experimental gene tech and not having skin fall off.</p>
<p>I mean, either way, if a simple otc med can cause a reaction like this in synastry, it’s still not looking safe to me.</p>

        <p>You're not understanding how any of this works. Someone with a single allele variant in a single gene is more likely to develop SJS from any medication. What happens is the vaccine ducks them up and they take tylenol, which created this reaction. It's cytotoxic storm. They may even be able to take tylenol again someday, but the combination of tylenol after the vaccine is what does it. There are lots of drugs that can cause this, seizure drugs, nsaids, antibiotics, you name it. What is happening in the body after vaccination that causes the person to take the tylenol in the first place is the real reason it happens, but chances are, they could have escaped the reaction altogether if they took ibuprofen instead. 
I feel like you're skepticism isn't allowing you to understand this or what I'm saying.  And before you make assumptions, I'm not pro vaccine, I have been damaged after a shot and due tons of research and read tons of studies. I read about SJS when reading ng about my own injury, and shortly after my friend's son developed seizures after tdap and hep B and SJS within 3 days of getting them and starting a seizure med that actually wasn't known to cause sjs previously. This probably means it was simply the vaccine and not the seizure meds, or that they need to include that class of drugs in the categories of drug that may cause SJS.  These shots are trash and have been since 1986 at the least, but they most certainly can interact with there drugs and cause further complications </p>
<p>Anyways tldr</p>
<p>There are plenty of cases of sjs from tylenol, but most ppl had taken tylenol previously without any reactions. It's only when they take tylenol directly after a jab that sjs seems to appear for many of them, but that is getting harder and harder to find online without paying $40/study</p>

        <p>“Whats happening in the body after vaccine (experimental gene therapy in my words) is what does it”</p>
<p>Yes, actually I think I understand quite clearly and we are on the same page.</p>
<p>“Tylenol in the first place is the real reson it happens”</p>
<p>Chances are also, that the person never took tylenol, this is all hear say and speculation, </p>
<p>In fact! I have not read an article that claimed he took any medicines, </p>
<p>Here is a pretty standard article on the situation and it clearly says the vaccine was the only possible cause.</p>
<p>“"It all just happened so fast. My skin peeled off," he told WRIC. He consulted a dermatologist, who sent him straight to the ER.</p>
<p>"It was stinging, burning, and itching. Whenever I bent my arms or legs, like the inside of my knee, it was very painful where the skin was swollen and was rubbing against itself," Terrell told the outlet. He spent five days in the hospital, where his legs, hands, and arms swelled, turned purple, and became very painful.</p>
<p>In the hospital, doctors determined that Terrell's symptoms were a rare reaction to the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>"We ruled out all the viral infections, we ruled out COVID-19 itself, we made sure that his kidneys and liver was okay, and...”</p>
<p>“finally we came to the conclusion that it was the vaccine that he had received that was the cause,"</p>

        <p>Wow that is sick. But at the same time telling her she died from the vaccine isn't really gonna help either. But honestly the people in that sub seem like psychos. They are just there to talk straight facts with a tiny pinch of compassion (for effect).</p>
