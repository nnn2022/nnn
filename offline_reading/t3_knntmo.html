    <strong>Can I ask my new employer if they’ll force the covid vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys. So I got a job finally after several months of unemployment (laid off because of covid). Anyway. How do I bring up to my new employer my concerns about whether they’ll force the vaccine once we all return to office? Thanks in advance for any insight.</p></p>

        <p>When you get a job you sign a contract with your employee. You can negotiate your contract terms. Demand that they specifically state that they will not requiere any kind of vaccination proof prior or after the contract comes into force.</p>
<p>People, be smart. Also, consult with a lawyer for this kind of issues.</p>

        <p>What? What country are you from? Most people are "at will employees"? What does that even mean? Of course we work "at will" but that is why we write contracts, to regulate the terms of the job at hand. What you are describing sounds like exploitation.</p>

        <p>You are right, I am from Europe but, pardon my ignorance, it seems just common sense to me. I have never got into a job without negotiating the terms of my contract.</p>
<p>In some parte of Europe you have standard contracts, short of "sanctioned" by the government or the unions depending on the sector you work in but I have always refused to signed on any of those without modifying what I thought was not convenient for me.</p>
<p>I assume not everybody has the same negotiating power but if more people were aware of the fact that you should regulate your job conditions by means of a contract,  I think less abuse would happen</p>

        <p>If you're an American being hired, your main concern is probably going to be total compensation (salary and benefits). In turn, you will likely be provided with an employee handbook outlining the company's expectations of you. Both of those are subject to change, and you either agree or walk away. You are expected to be treated the same as any other person at that company.</p>
<p>In theory, this means that companies can be abusive to employees and vice versa, but in practice, most aren't that way. The companies don't want to have to train new people because it is expensive, and most people will provide two weeks notice to their employer when they leave out of courtesy and because they don't want to earn a bad reputation.</p>

        <p>A verbal contract, yes, this is a reasonable interpretation. Possibly also something in writing, but it will not, at least for most Americans, be very lengthy.</p>

&rt;<br>
&rt;Well, *mandate I would word it as.</p>
<p>It depends on your judgement of the situation, but I would whenever possible call the underlying reality what it really is instead of using their euphemisms - which in this case are forced injections.</p>
<p>I would try to avoid it to make it easier for them to deny the underlying violence and brutality behind all this. It wont be possible at all times to call it what it is, but it's the right thing to do if you can.</p>

        <p>No thank <em>you</em>! Doing things like this is what counts and will make more and more people aware of what is actually happening in its entirety.</p>
<p>A nice bonus that could potentially come with it: if the future employer is against this stuff themselves you even have a big plus for talking straight against this garbage. And I think a lot of employers specifically are really fed up with this as well, in certain fields especially so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also if I look at youtube comments I'm not so sure how many people are actually on which side, because there are a lot of people voicing their disagreement to all of this just as they do here, so who knows if we really are that much of a minority. </p>
<p>The ones actively demanding the boot are actually a minority I think - and of course one that gets completely and deliberately blown out of proportion on sites like reddit, where everyone else gets simply silenced or bullied by some mob on the mainstream subs. But I think real life could be quite different.</p>

        <p>It's only a matter of time (starting after the summer of 2021) before you need to show your ID including your vaccination pass while traveling. This applies to commuting as well. The army or police will have checkpoints set on the road by that time.</p>
<p>In other words: even if your employer doesn't require you to be vaxxinated, 'the system' <em>will</em> require it.</p>
