        <p>Our resident Dr Death Tony Holohan is back. Seriously look him up. </p>
<p>The stats today are: 21 in ICU, and 134 in hospital. Keep in mind it was confirmed a few days ago that if you test positive for covid while in the hospital for a broken ankle, you're counted as one of the 134 hospitalized people.</p>

<p>Yeah, that happens all the time here in the land of the "free." Despite what the doomer cultists will tell you. Like the guy in Florida (IIRC) who got his head taken clean off in a motorcycle accident.</p>

        <p>Update for Ireland: didn't go into full lockdown (thank GOD) but they implemented stricter measures that have already been in Dublin for weeks. It's basically nothing. And they said they were going to enforce the measures much stricter than they have been, which is laughable because the Irish government and police suck at enforcing anything. I doubt much will change.</p>
<p>A massive relief, but we weren't going to lockdown anyway because Ireland would completely collapse if we did. I honestly think the health advisors did this to scare us, which is really shitty of them to do.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, it's fucking hilarious to watch the doomers (especially r/Ireland) lose their shit over this.</p>

        <p>So the previous commentor was correct that your nation is Ireland?</p>
<p>If so, that's extremely unfortunate. Given Ireland's history of being staunch followers of Christ in some form, I'm sure all the religious service and marriage and funeral restrictions weigh heavily</p>

        <p>Yeah, Ireland has always been a shit show, but this is taking the piss. I don't even think we have a government anymore. What we have is a dictatorship ruled by "medical experts" called NPHET. To add insult to injury, we had a COVID committee that was disbanded just before NPHET recommended returning to level 5, and it was very obviously disbaned because they didn't agree with lockdown or masks.</p>

        <p>My husband and I had a trip planned there 1 week before the countries locked down in March. We were so excited to see your beautiful country and drink all the Jameson lol</p>
<p>He wants to go as soon as everything is all clear and I told him sorry I have no desire to spend my money in a country that has done this to people. Makes me sad but you guys definitely had strict restrictions. My thoughts are with you and remember to fight back. We need to be strong.</p>

        <p>The worst part is that this is happening because the Irish healthcare system sucks. And the government has known that for years and has done absolutely nothing about it. That's the worst part about the Irish government; they are absolutely shit at planning things and seem to have no idea how to fix problems. It makes all of us so angry that we're suffering because of the government's incompetence.</p>

        <p>Fear not OP! I recognize you from another thread! :)</p>
<p>News sources have just begun to report that the government is unlikely to go through with it. One pointed out that Ireland will suffer permanent economic damage if they do. Look what the first lockdown did to us. If we did it again we’d be <em>fucked</em>. The government knows this. It’ll be a huge embarrassment for them.</p>
<p>Also, most people seem to be crying bullshit on it. Remember that most counties are still at level 2. Jumping from level 2 to level 5 is simply not fair. Remember when everyone obeyed in March? That’s not happening this time. I go from Wicklow to Dublin almost daily and I never have an issue. Dublin is always crowded. I lived in downtown Dublin back in March and pretty much <em>nobody</em> was out then. It’s different today. People aren’t listening anymore. There <em>will</em> be a pushback if Ireland decides to do this, and resistance is already growing.</p>
<p>I already decided that I simply won’t listen to these measures if they are implemented. I just won’t. I refuse. And honestly, you don’t have to either. Who you see and where you go is YOUR DECISION, not the government’s. It’s none of their business. The government doesn’t have to control your life if you don’t let it. And they’re being so incompetent at enforcing this thing (especially after golfgate) that I doubt anyone will run into trouble.</p>

        <p>I haven't been following the restrictions from the beginning, and I know people are sick of this shit because I live in North Dublin and I'd say only half the shop ever wear their masks. Even my doomer granny has been breaking restrictions since early August. My worry is if the government decides to close everything themselves, I can't even ignore it. I can't go into closed shops, and I can't visit a funeral if the church limits it to 10. We actually NEED the small business owners of Ireland to risk the fines and stay open if this is to ever end. Also, I wouldn't complain if Holohan and the entirety of NPHET got a smack of a bus.</p>
<p>I pray the govt says no to a full lockdown, but even just the recommendation will force more and more restrictions. I'd say Dublin's level 3 might drop down to 4 or at least be extended past Christmas, and the rest of the country will probably join us in level 3. I actually think it's more nepharious to keep workplaces open but stop all the fun stuff. It's a strange dystopia where we're effectively allowed just enough freedom to keep the economy afloat and the government's pockets lined.</p>

        <p>Yeah but Americans are way more rebellious than the Irish when it comes to government. Nobody’s trusted Congress for decades and half the country hates the president at any given time no matter who it is, so it’s easy for Americans not to care what the government says.</p>

        <p>True, I remember seeing how many people were letting off fireworks in LA (they were banned, and individual use was already illegal) just as restrictions were loosening up and thinking "This is it! They can't turn it back now!" and sure as shit...it did go back. With a vengeance. You can see the beautiful video here though: <a href="https://youtu.be/EdDo5TfAakc">https://youtu.be/EdDo5TfAakc</a> Those were all individual people across different ethnicities and social strata illegally doing this, it was something to see.</p>

        <p>Stay alive, friend. There is plenty you can do to work on your own peace, and resist. Yes, it's full tyranny, that means rebellion is staying alive. Please see your way to getting through this. I'm in the North and it looks like we'll be getting the same soon.</p>

<p>mmmm, this possessive pronoun strikes again.</p>
<p>the government is not in any way, shape or form, 'yours'. you do not own it, you obviously do not control it and have absolutely not the slightest 'say' in what it's paid agents say or do.</p>
<p>i have declared war on possessive collective pronouns!!</p>
<p>that said, all you can do is resist as best you can and defy these tyrannical dictates when the opportunity arises. seek out like minded people and associate only with them, shun anyone who tolerates and encourages the new abnormal'</p>

        <p>It looks like they are testing more extreme measures in some areas. Nothing about this is normal - the virus just isn't that threatening.</p>
<p>This simply must be about something else. To say what would be speculation, but there's no way this is what it proclaims to be on the surface.</p>

        <p>I want this not to be true just like everyone else. But it's hard not to think that when CNN and many other news websites are telling us bluntly that there is no going back to normal. That Covid has changed the world for good. That we need to accept we will never revert to the way things were. If this agenda is running that deep it means there are powerful people in the US doing the most to set it in motion! I have started compiling a list of articles that runs the SAME themes, buzzwords and scare tactics that are in the book outlining the Great Reset by Klaus Schwab. The  book itself is sinister. They are not asking permission or proposing an alternative. They are explicitly saying we are going to do things our way now. And the media is prepping us with the SAME language and ideas!</p>

        <p>Yes, yes.  It doesn't HAVE to be a new normal.  We don't HAVE to be scared of this virus. They are doing this to us, and right now people are accepting it. It doesn't help that those of us who disagree are largely silenced from one another.</p>
<p>Right now people are (stupidly) divided by political lines over this issue. I'm not sure what will change after November 3 but... Many will vote based on their opinions around this virus and it may give us a clue as to what the future holds.</p>

The general population have been pissed since we went into Level 3 a few weeks ago, but they do fuck all about it.

        <p>First of all, it's been said a whole lot, but please don't actually kill yourself or hurt yourself in any way. If you die, their anti-social, anti-human policies win, and we all lose. The pro-lockdown crowd loves to chant about how they care if their lockdowns "save one life", but they don't mean it and don't care if you kill yourself so long as you remain quarantined. We here actually care about saving even one life, except it's not just COVID we want to save people from, it's these sadistic lockdowns that want us all to be hermits living in our basements and living rooms all day. Don't harm yourself in any way, or these cretins will win.</p>
<p>Second, I can tell you're not a true Redditor because these lockdowns play right into the anti-social, hermetic nature of Redditors, who overwhelmingly cheer for these lockdowns and scold people like us who don't want to participate in them. It's a good thing not to be a true Redditor, too; Redditors are socially-inept, obsessed with karma and social media, and blatantly devoid of reason to the point where they outright refuse to conduct themselves around people they dislike or differ from ideologically. Thus, lockdowns that give them an excuse to stay indoors all day plays right into their social habits and makes these lockdowns the most ideal situation ever for a Redditor.</p>
<p>If you've noticed that this lockdown lacks any sort of compassion and seems to just impose restrictions upon people however unreasonable they may seem to be, you'd be right in suspecting such. These lockdown proceedings directly spit in the face of what we are as humans. Even the biggest introverts on Earth cannot work alone their entire lives. They need someone in their lives, even if it's a complete stranger, to keep them truly human. Doing this is stripping from us the opportunity to do that, and to have basic interactions. It is sadistic, and we all sympathize with what you're saying about all of this.</p>
<p>Hang in there, man. These evil bastards might want you to repress your feelings about the lockdowns until you harm yourself, but we don't want you to do that and would rather you actually take care of yourself instead.</p>
