    <strong>Insanity</strong>
    <p><p>Few days ago I was travelling. For the first time in a while I actually chose to wear a mask paired with huge sunglasses to my advantage because I actually felt and looked like garbage from all the travelling and because I wasn't wearing makeup. </p>
<p>On the train there was a guy who wasn't wearing a mask. If said guy wouldn't have been harassing me on the train station earlier and if he wouldn't have been talking to himself and acting like a psycho on the train the whole time I may have taken it off too even though I felt ugly, but for once I left it on</p>
<p>That's not the point of this story though, I can't even say how many people came up to this man together and straight up mobbed him yelling at him to put his mask on. He was a creep the whole time but even he then put it on. I couldn't and still can't believe this shit. Even though he was disgusting towards me earlier I was rooting for this clown to resist</p>
<p>I never wear a mask on train or in stores or anywhere and if I do I wear a mesh one. I get comments too but I was never mobbed and no one has ever straight up yelled at me. I don't know if it may be because I'm a girl or because I always look angry but what the fuck is this</p></p>

<p>I have heard that term allot lately describing peoples behavior during the pandemic.  It seems to bring out the worst in people. </p>
<p>What surprises me about your story was that he put on a mask.  </p>
<p>There are many mentally ill people today. Some medicated some not so much.  I think we need to be cautious around them as you did.  But it is sad when people appear to attack them.</p>
