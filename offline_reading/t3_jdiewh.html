    <strong>I was wondering if residents in any of the following states can provide updates as to how they are functioning: TX, PA, OH, AZ, NV, WI, GA and VA?</strong>
    <p><p>At this point, CA, MI and NY on one end and FL, SD and other states that made it with little or no lockdown on the other on the other are self explanatory.  However, in those much less often covered states there seems to be much less reliable info.  Additionally, the states listed above are particularly important to American development and the livelihoods of their citizens hasn't been covered nearly as much.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So for anyone in the states listed in the OP, how has it actually been with restaurants, stores, malls, parks and other outlets being open and running sufficiently?  Are hospitals running effectively; are there any developments what could be spun into tall tales of them being overwhelmed and forcing dying Covid patients to the streets?  It would be great to know more.</p></p>

        <p>Georgia never really shut down and has been pretty much back to normal with no mask mandate for months now. Some stores do require masks but no one has said a word to me about not wearing one and I always see others in the store not wearing them too.</p>
<p>Bars have been packed for months now and many places I go seem to be allowing 100% capacity. I was at the Braves watch party at the stadium on Friday and there were thousands of people there crammed in and every bar was packed. You would have never guessed other states were still freaking out about the “pandemic”</p>

        <p>AZ is completely open with capacity restrictions but even those seem iffy. Schools  are going back in person and none of my friends with kids have mentioned anything about them closing again. Masks required in most stores but some towns in the valley are lifting their local restrictions and its hit or miss where they’re mandated. You can tell people are over it. </p>
<p>My workout class requires masks indoors &amp; has lowered capacity. They do several classes outside per week with machines moved outdoors where masks aren’t required. It’s super nice in the AM now so I’m really enjoying the outdoor classes. </p>
<p>People don’t seem freaked out of other people by and large. We’ve had 10-12 friends over for dinner and hanging out regularly and people are cautious but that kind of stops with home gatherings. I’ve been in CA for a week and AZ is way more chill than CA although CA has been less crazy than I expected (except for Monterey. Damn they’re scared in Monterey). Some of my friends who were pretty scared in AZ have really chilled out and started going out to bars and restaurants that have moved outside. It’s a great time of year to be outside in Phoenix so people seem to be really coming alive. I’m buying a new bike so I can ride a lot this winter. Phoenix doesn’t get very cold at all so I’m looking forward to everything being outside and not having too much of a bad covid issue this winter!</p>
<p>Hospitals are still hovering around their lowest in patients for covid. They fluctuate daily but nothing steadily increasing. Cases going up but that seems to be a lot of high school and college doing constant testing so it’s not translating into hospitalizations and death.</p>

        <p>AZ Phoenix area is open, with reduced capacity and mask mandates posted at every building entry (though there are a few gems out there who aren't obeying).  Many small businesses and restaurants are suffering and won't survive.  Others have adapted.</p>
<p>Very little pushback on going maskless recently - not many people left in retail willing to fight for dystopia, but you quickly learn what places to avoid. General mask compliance appears to be around 99% indoors and maybe 25% outside.</p>
<p>Hospitals aren't overwhelmed and never were during the entire fiasco.  COVID has been a fake emergency where 100% of the damage was caused by the government response.  No one would know we went through a pandemic if it wasn't propagandized.</p>

        <p>I've left NV, but this is a factoid I find interesting. At the beginning of lockdowns, I thought the pandemic might be real. I live alone and was working from home. I wanted to do something, so I contacted the volunteer deparments at three hospitals. Not a single one was "onboarding" volunteers in the height of the so-called crisis. It made me think.</p>

        <p>Texas here we live in the country outside of a pretty small rural town. Because my husband is out of work I’m not really out shopping for pleasure. But our local dollar store doesn’t enforce muzzle rules (was there a couple of weeks ago and strolled in bare-faced and no one said a word). </p>
<p>We went out to eat at a local restaurant at the end of Sept and we walked in with no muzzles and no hassle.</p>
<p>My oldest will stay after school waiting for band practice and goes to a local gas station. He has never worn a muzzle in and no one says anything.</p>
<p>A local bar opened in Sept (thumbing their noses at Abbott). </p>
<p>My kids are in football and my husband and I will wear a gaiter going through the gate but immediately take them off once we have our tickets.</p>
<p>We shop at the H-E-B in a larger small town. I haven’t tried going in barefaced but once I’m through the doors I pull my gaiter down to my chin. No one has hassled me.</p>
<p>School for my kids has been kinda normal except for a few BS security theatre. My kids were getting bold with pulling down their gaiters. However, the school has two Corna-crap cases so the teachers started getting in the kids more about the muzzles and such. </p>
<p>I was also at a local tire shop getting a tire replaced and no muzzles to be seen.</p>
<p>I would say at the H-E-B it’s 100 % mask compliant and dollar store was 98 % compliant.
The football games it’s about 50% compliant.
I occasionally see muzzles sheep walking by themselves and/or driving by themselves.</p>
<p>I have no idea about the cities (I’m WFH so I don’t drive into the city anymore) or suburbs.</p>
<p>I took my husband to the local hospital for blood work last week and it was a ghost town. </p>
<p>Also, there is a funeral home I pass to fetch my kids from school. I’ve never seen a pile of bodies outside of it. </p>
<p>Next week I plan on voting in person sans a muzzle.</p>

        <p>I recently moved from WA back to my hometown in PA, and it's so cucked here. Western PA seemed to give no fucks, it was great. But most people here are masked up, outdoors. 100% indoors. I was walking down the street one day, and a woman coming my direction ON THE OTHER SIDE hurriedly threw a mask over her face like it was for my benefit or was afraid I'd say something? It was weird. My family is full masktarded... like my mom and sister visited and came up to the house wearing masks, then took them off when they came in. I didn't bother asking what they thought that was accomplishing...</p>
<p>An employee at Acme physically intimidated me (lol so much for social distancing) for not wearing a mask. I was at a Wal-Mart the other day and an employee told me to put on a mask--I just said, "yes, master," then took it off again when I turned the corner. Gyms are open, but you have to wear a mask. The one my BF joined and I was interested in had snotty signs about how you can have your membership terminated if you don't wear your mask the right way.</p>
<p>I'd say it's worse here than in Seattle in terms of aggressiveness about masks. Honestly, I would have moved to AZ or FL instead of coming back here if not for my BF. It's really upsetting seeing my hometown this way. But there's no rioting or fires here, and I'm renting a house for less than I was spending on a 1 bedroom apartment...</p>

        <p>GA here; about 90% normal I’d say. The safety theatre is heavy in the more “woke” areas of Atlanta but is visibly diminished when you go further out. Pretty much all restaurants open for dine in, a few do temp checks or other silliness but the rest just have waitstaff wear masks and X off a few tables inside. Low investment. Everyone at my regular haunts seems happy to be back. </p>
<p>I haven’t been to too many large gatherings, except I did go to a few dog sport competitions/shows (my main hobby). No concerts still. </p>
<p>Last week I went to the hospital for a bad bout of gastritis/food poisoning/vomiting and the wait was annoyingly long in the ER. I asked a nurse about it, and it didn’t seem like it was a function of COVID—she said it was quiet all that weekend and then the day I came in everyone just happened to check in at once. She estimated about 2/3 were for non COVID related reasons and 1/3 were “suspicion of/concern for COVID” but they’re relegated to a different waiting room and wing.</p>

        <p>Eastern PA resident here - work as a server in a restaurant and a machine operator at a gun manufacturer in the morning. At the plant there are no mask rules because the guys just refused to wear them. But at the restaurant we're at 25% capacity with idiotic rules about not being able to serve alcohol without food and mandatory last call at 10:45 PM. </p>
<p>As for public life, I used to work as a substitute teacher before the lockdown closed schools. (Most schools are either fully virtual or are a hybrid with 2 days in person for a select population of students). Stores have strict capacity rules and many places have shortened their hours. The Lehigh Valley Mall closes at 7 pm on a Friday and Saturday night. 100% mask enforcement with plenty of whistleblowers hounding anyone without masks. The population is very split, probably near a 50/50 set up between Biden and Trump and the corresponding lockdown views.</p>
