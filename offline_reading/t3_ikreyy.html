        <p>&rt;<strong>The US is nowhere near herd immunity</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So far, more than 6 million people in the US have tested positive for COVID-19. That's an enormous number, but not nearly enough to get close to herd immunity.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"There are still 90%-plus of Americans who are still subject to getting this virus," Adm. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician overseeing the US's coronavirus testing efforts, told reporters in a call on Wednesday. "Now that's different in some parts of New York and some parts of New Jersey and Detroit. But overall, the virus is in a target-rich environment."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Already, more than 183,000 people have died in the US.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It's unclear exactly how many more people would need to be infected to achieve protection through herd immunity. Epidemiologists calculate this number based on a metric called R0 (pronounced R-naught) — the number of people to whom an average infected person passes a pathogen. For the coronavirus, that's about 2 to 2.5.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That means that about 50-70% of the population would need to be immune in order to stop the virus' spread. In the US, that's about 165 million to 230 million people. With the COVID-19 death rate estimated to be about 1%, that means reaching herd immunity could cost the US as many as 2.3 million lives.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Still, some research has suggested that the herd immunity threshold could be as low as 20% of the population, since some groups of people have more interpersonal contact than others. If just those groups were to reach herd immunity, that could significantly decrease the virus' opportunities to spread. But even in that optimistic scenario, about 600,000 people would still die.</p>
<p>It's shit like this that pisses me off! Of fucking course we're nowhere near herd immunity!! You pulled the lockdown BS and delayed it!! <strong>YOU'RE DOING THIS ON PURPOSE!!!</strong></p>

        <p>I mean, how are people supposed to develop immunity to the virus if they try to avoid it at all costs? Countries that never locked down or went crazy with restrictions are much better off now. I swear these people writing such articles must be paid trolls... And a 1% death rate? How the hell did they come up with that?</p>

        <p>Bullshit. They're not counting asymptomatic or the people that couldn't get tested.</p>
<p>And the 1 percent death rate- I'm pretty sure we threw that out back in April.</p>

        <p>Exactly. </p>
<p>Also plenty of places in the USA are near or at the herd immunity threshold enough for the curve to be flattening. The threshold is far lower than was presented, and there was existing immunity.</p>

        <p>Yes it does. Getting infected does not mean going to the hospital. Most people experience this disease like a regular cold, or don't even realize they are sick. And in what world are 100 million people going to all get deathly sick all at the same time. Come back to reality.</p>

        <p>100+ million were never going to get infected all in a peak or get significantly ill. For the vast majority they are asymptomatic or experience mild to moderate symptoms as you do with a cold or flu. They are <em>so</em> sick they either wouldn't know it or wouldn't bother seeing a doctor normally. Sure sure you can't deal with that. 🤣</p>

        <p>I agree, which is why herd immunity is a pipe dream. It just would have been a devastating wave all Spring, followed by another one this Fall. With the current course of action, the Spring was less bad than it could have been and it remains to be seen what's in store this Fall. It's likely not going to be good.</p>
<p>My point is, letting the virus run unabated would cause America as we know it to collapse. Model it with even zero deaths and you still have too many people sick and hospitalized for the infrastructure to handle. Many services become overrun and far too many people go bankrupt. It would trigger a depression.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity is already happening. The threshold is low due to existing immunity. It's not a pipe dream it's a reality. You can't stop it. Lockdowns were never evidence-based and nor are the restrictions you and other countries have in place.</p>
<p>Countries that didn't lockdown and followed previous pandemic response measures actually based on evidence didn't have any of that happen. Those fears were based on terrible models that were hysterical and invalid. The harm done by lockdowns is disproportionate to the risk of the virus.</p>

        <p>It's not. There's no scientific evidence that any city, state or country has reached herd immunity. You are confusing behavior changes lower the Re value as herd immunity. That's not it.</p>

        <p>Nope, there's clear evidence of behavioral changes. Look at Google's mobility data. Stockholm, Sweden is particularly interesting.</p>
<p>There's no evidence of herd immunity. All we've seen are models that place it anywhere from 20% to 60%. It's likely in the upper half of that range and no city, state or country has even come close to that much infection.</p>

        <p>No, it's not likely to be the upper end of that range at all due to the nature of <em>natural</em> herd immunity and the evidence.</p>
<p>There is ZERO evidence that has changed the course of the virus and how far it has spread. At all.</p>

        <p>And running the economy into the ground hasn't caused a recession, a housing crisis, and a lot of death? </p>
<p>Herd immunity was the only way out- you encourage the immunocompromised to stay isolated, and you let the rest of us get it.</p>
