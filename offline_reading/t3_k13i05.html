    <strong>“If you don’t wear a mask or stay home, you shouldn’t get medical treatment over someone responsible!”</strong>
    <p><p>Paraphrased, but it’s not far from what a lot of the pro lockdown crowd says. They insist that anyone who is against mask mandates or wants to celebrate Thanksgiving or protest restrictions should sign a waiver saying they won’t seek treatment, they shouldn’t go to a hospital if they get sick, or a doctor should refuse to help them. </p>
<p>Why is this virus the only medical condition we do this with? Could you imagine if we denied healthcare to people for other stupid things they do in life? Think about it:</p>
<p>“Oh you’re a drug addict who stole money from their family? Sorry but we’re not going to let you get into rehab.” </p>
<p>“You got lung cancer because you smoked for 20 years even though you knew the dangers, and you didn’t try to quit? Well too bad, you should have known better. We’d rather treat someone who got lung cancer through no fault of their own.” </p>
<p>“You got behind the wheel while drunk and now you got hurt? Sorry, go home in agonizing pain and think about what you’ve done. You should have signed off on tour right to treatment before you had five beers and decided to drive anyway.”</p>
<p>See how ridiculous that is? Rapists, murderers who are locked up for life, the Boston Marathon bomber...they all still have/had the right to care even though they’ve done some heinous things. Yet when I choose to celebrate Thanksgiving with my family, I get told “Don’t go to a hospital if you can’t breathe” or “You shouldn’t get medical treatment.” All because I chose to see my grandma (who wants to be at dinner, trust me!) over sitting at home alone and calling everyone on Zoom. </p>
<p>So why is it OK to suggest people just trying to live their life don’t deserve hospital beds or care when people who day way worse in their life than don’t wear a mask to the grocery store can get the same care I do? Why is it only this virus that people moralize and are OK with saying someone doesn’t deserve to be treated for?</p></p>

        <p>I’ve seen a similar attitude regarding a recent article about how rural areas (with no hospitals, mind you) are sending their very sick patients to the ICU’s in their local urban centers...all the urbanites who hate rural voters are complaining that they shouldn’t get to use those services because they “don’t take the pandemic seriously.”</p>

<p>Hey there! I'm an actual career psychologist, and you're correct. Personal psychology precludes political positions. This means most people will project their true personality towards others through politics, and genuinely think it's not a display of their true thoughts, but rather just an opinion.</p>
<p>TL;DR people that are naturally and inherently shitty people will attempt to act like their political position led them to this obvious, moral conclusion about others being wrong. Couldn't be more backwards lol.</p>
<p>The least aware of this is the left, just like with economics and basic nutrition LOL.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. I really hate this “argument”, and all of the shaming that goes on in general. It’s cancel culture not just on steroids but meth and PCP. </p>
<p>This year has made me lose so much faith in humanity it’s almost unfathomable, between the sheer maliciousness and the blatant craving for authoritarianism. There are people I used to be good friends with who I have lost all respect for and will probably never speak to again because of it. Thankfully I still know a lot of really cool people too, even if they’re not as passionate about this as me.</p>

        <p>The hostility towards anyone who dares to think differently is frightening and infuriating at the same time.I just realized, that ppl are more self-righteous against covid then they were in the 80 ies ,where there was an HIV epidemics! Holy shit and i thought that was bad,when i saw all the anti gay propaganda.. Ppl are legit acting increasingly hostile towards other ppl who don't want to be enslaved ,bcs of the flu and don't want to be scrutinized,shamed and marginalized if they get the virus. What i hate the most is ,how worthless zombies celebrate if someone who was mask skeptical die with/from covid. Those ppl are not humans anymore. </p>
<p>I wonder  at which point there will be talking: Why don't we just kill the infected ppl and anyone who disagree with us.</p>

        <p>It’s so stupid and would be completely unethical for medical personnel.  Even a mass murder who deliberately and purposely killed a bunch of people is given medical treatment if he is taken alive.   Punishment is for courts to decide  not to be delivered in the heat of them moment by medical personnel.  And can imagine the opportunities for abuse.

        <p>The key is to stop expecting logic, or responsibility, from people that never gave a fuck about those two things anyway, and have been given every reason imaginable to exemplify that via virtue signaling, while simultaneously doing more damage to human history in the process than anything they've been fooled into think they're saving us all from.</p>

        <p>Even just restricting it to COVID. OK, you have no real control over your age, but the next most powerful predictor of hospitalization is not mask wearing but weight.</p>
<p>You were at Krispy Kreme?  no ICU for you.</p>
<p>Quite seriously, local hospitals were considering denying service to people from my county.  Most local hospitals are in a neighboring county as they are in many places.  But my county will not enforce mask mandates, so if you live here, they don't want you in <em>their</em> hospitals.</p>
