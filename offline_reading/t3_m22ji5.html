<p>She should be corrected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then release a formal statement apologizing for mis-speaking on a matter of which she is clearly uninformed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then she needs to inform the public that the Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp; Johnson covid "vaccines" are in fact not FDA reviewed or approved.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The experimental technology used in the new covid  treatments are only approved for emergency use at this time and are not indicated to prevent any specific disease.  </p>
<p>If this is not cleared up the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Joe Biden's mouth piece intentionally mislead and lied to the American people.  Psaki is Potus' rep to the press.  She represents Joe Biden.  By definition, this means Joe Biden will have intentionally lied to the American people.  </p>
<p>If they do not correct this in a very accurate and public manner, right away, then I have no idea what to say.... people complained Trump was unpresidential and not polished enough?  This is laughable.</p>
