    <strong>Covid Vaccinated Subreddit: "Need Help... 2 Weeks and I Am Still Suffering." OK...</strong>
    <p><p>How can there be any discussion of making the Covid-19 vaccine mandatory at all with stories such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/oju0f9/need_hope_ppl_getting_long_term_neuro_symptoms/">these</a>?</p>
<p>Then the top comment I'm seeing says "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/oju0f9/need_hope_ppl_getting_long_term_neuro_symptoms/h54s67j/">my wife has been suffering for a little over 4 months</a>." The poster continues, <em>"She went from being a 30 y/o woman who worked out almost every day, had a ton of daily hobbies to being unable to work due to pain, arm and leg weakness, working out flared her symptoms, and she has no drive or anything to continue most of her hobbies because she’s been in so much pain... All of her symptoms came after her vaccination."</em></p>
<p><strong>It becomes abundantly clear that the act of taking the vaccine is a CULT-LIKE ACTIVITY WITH 0 BASIS IN LOGIC when cult-like comments are added such as:</strong> <em>This whole thing has been a nightmare. We opted to do the right thing in getting the vaccine as we aren’t an anti vaccine house. But it’s turned her world upside down.</em></p>
<p>All of these things sound <em>way worse</em> than Covid-19 itself, and this is coming from someone who had a rough case of Covid. What ever happened to medical agency? To independent choice? </p>
<p>And now we have "Western" nations such as France joining in with their "sanitary passport." It is blatantly unethical and downright wrong to mandate a medical treatment that has the potential for these downsides. At the least the manufacturers must be held to complete liability for the potential side-effects, IF it is to be mandated. </p>
<p>But shock shock, surprise surprise, the Covid Cult doesn't care about any of this. "Follow the rules, get in line, take you vax, don't be an anti-vaxxer," and for what? </p>
<p>To risk my immune system for the delta variant, which is killing vaccinated people regardless? To remain in lockdown? When does it end? Because it clearly doesn't. At least in my country. </p>
<p><em>Note that some of the above quotes have been cut up to be shorter, however the meaning has not been changed deceitfully. All references linked.</em></p></p>

        <p>That's why it's clear to me we're blanketed with evil and in end times. Everything is inverted. Unvaccinated people are healthy, productive, no aches, pains, clots, etc. yet are being barred from many locations and jobs. Vaccinated are sickly, out of it mentally, can barely walk but they're "allowed" to be everywhere.</p>
<p>AND there is not even a claim that the vaccines impart immunity, thus the continued forced masking at many places. So if they don't provide immunity, why are vaxed and unvaxed treated differently? We're all still superspreaders. </p>
<p>We are being gaslighted beyond anything a sane person could imagine. </p>
<p>The Luciferian psychopaths have taken over the world.</p>

        <p>I know..no one gives shit about how sick people are getting from this crap. I have multiple autoimmune disorders, I am having a flare today....[pain in joints, extreme exhaustion, mouth sores, and extremely swollen glands] and NEVER had the vaxx.</p>
<p>Now think about this, these assholes want to force this crap on me. I have suffered enough. I've read a lot of Covid Vaccinated, outside of the heart vascular spike protein crap, they all sound like severe autoimmune cases.</p>
<p>Autoimmune stuff disables and can kill. People underestimate it.</p>

        <p>All these people are having weeks to <em>months</em> of debilitating side effects and still pushing for everyone to get vaccinated. I wonder what they'll do or think when their issues last for 4-5 months, and start to feel better, only to have to take the booster shot and start this shit all over again. Again and again. Will they still take the jab?</p>
