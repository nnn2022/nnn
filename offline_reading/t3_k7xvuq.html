    <strong>Covid Life Sucks, a dumb, self-pitying rant by me</strong>
    <p><p>Using a throwaway account, ofc. Sorry if this post doesn't fit the sub.</p>
<p>I've had suicidal thoughts for a sizable portion of my life, but I don't think they've ever felt as immediate as they do now. I can't visit my family, I can't really network or make any new friends, and I worry that the one friend I do have would completely cut me out of his life if he knew how I felt about the Rona mandates and stuff.</p>
<p>March of this year, like for many people, was a big moment of realization. The first happening was when my mom and I (we'd go on evening walks around a nearby lake most days) were yelled at by several people for not wearing masks. Since then, she's always worn one when going outside, and urged me to. The second issue was when in an email to another student at my NYC art school, I called her a moron and a brat for advocating for a *complete* closure of the school until "the Chinese Coronavirus" (as I referred to it) was dealt with. I was put into a Zoom call with the Title 9 coordinator for a 'racist' email and was strongly urged to drop out because the incident "could make it difficult to schedule [me] in future courses."</p>
<p>I'm currently in a shitty studio apartment in a very liberal town near my community college, with thin walls and a loud, music-loving dude across from me, and an incredibly loud (and bad-at-singing) couple below me that get in frequent domestic disputes and invite equally-loud friends over quite often. The school does zero events for meeting new people, and of my courses, only one even has zoom calls (the rest are exclusively text-based,) and I'm the only one who ever turns their camera on, including the teacher. What's even worse, is that if I go outside, the majority of people I see (probably around 75%) are wearing masks, and most of those people will turn around, cross the street, or otherwise avoid me like the disgusting disease-carrier I am. Yesterday, I said "Good morning" on a morning walk to a man wearing a mask. He, not even turning towards me, just grumbling "wear a mask." Normally I don't even get a response when I try to greet people anymore, so it was <em>something</em>, I suppose. I don't really enjoy going outside anymore, since I'm glared at, avoided, and seen as not a person, but someone who could potentially get everyone in the area infected. I've started to have dreams of being able to grocery shop without wearing a mask, and I hate that not wearing a mask is seen by my mind as something worth dreaming about. It feel a bit like I'm going crazy, which honestly wouldn't surprise me considering how isolated I am on a daily basis. I just don't want to cover my face, feel dehumanized, and presume that I have the rona and am a risk to everyone else's health.</p>
<p>My only friend up here in the region (where I've never lived before, mind you.) is my boyfriend of one year who is very much pro-mask and pro-lockdown. I've voiced my complaints about the measures before, as well as mentioning that I'm not concerned if people around me don't obey them, but to no avail. On top of that, I'm frequently told by him and his sister (who he lives with) that I'm putting the lives of everyone else at risk by wearing a bandana over my face rather than an actual facemask, which I am definitely not going to convert to since I refuse to spend any money on validating this nonsense.  They both routinely tell me that no company will want to hire me if I wear a bandana instead of a real mask, not that it matters though, since none of the entry level positions I could find within walking distance (I can't drive) accepted my application. I'm scared that if I told him how I really felt about this nonsense, he'd cut me out of his life and then I'd be even more alone.</p>
<p>My dad is the only person I have contact with who sees things my way, and he lives in the midwest. My friend would force me go through with the arbitrary 14-day "quarantine" if I did visit him (or have him visit me,) so it seems like it isn't really an option, as much as I do miss him.</p>
<p>I don't know what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this, and I'm kind of surprise I'm even considering publishing this in the first place. I guess what really pushed me over the edge is the talk of a vaccine becoming mandatory to travel, or attend events, and such. I don't want the covid jab. I may have even had it back in January when I got what felt like the worst flu of my life when I was commuting between NYC and New Rochelle to a school with a huge Chinese population (not that it's a bad thing of course, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the virus <em>not</em> getting to that college.) Even if I didn't, though, I'd much rather take my chances with covid than a liability-less vaccine that got fast-tracked through the system. But if requiring it really does become commonplace and if these mandates stick around, I don't feel like I have many options ;eft, especially considering how many times a 'return to normalcy' is placed behind "just a few weeks" or "just until we flatten the curve" or "just a bit longer." These promises can only keep coming for so long before I start to consider 'alternative' ways out of this situation, which I've been struggling with a lot and have no real outlet for them, or someone I can be honest with.</p>
<p>Reading over what I have, this definitely seems very whiny, so, uh, sorry about that. That being said, I definitely think "you're overthinking this, dipshit" or, "you're being defeatist, dumbass" is an appropriate response to my post, since I'd say only half of my complaints are anywhere close to being valid, to be completely honest. I'd really like to know that at least <em>some</em> of my thoughts have a basis in reality, though.</p></p>

<p>My ex is the same way; she even went so far as to download the covid tracing app... I was like wtf why would you do that? Once, she called me a plague rat :(  </p>
<p>At least you have your father; my dad is scared shitless. He says he has to be scared. I'm like dad, you're choosing to be scared.   </p>
<p>My advice would be visit your dad - it'll be good for both you and him.   </p>
<p>I tell people; you wouldn't buy a car for which the manufacturer has no liability. Don't take a vaccine for which the manufacturer has no liability.</p>

        <p>I feel the same, although I live in a less liberal area, it still feels like I’m going crazy. I was doing alright the last few months but with the recent “surge” and renewed fear it seems like we are headed back to March.</p>
<p>There’s something so uniquely damaging about being treated like a leper, as if any interaction with others will kill them. I get so offended when people try to avoid me on the sidewalk like I’m a threat to them. It hurts my feelings. I know everyone is reacting out of fear, but it makes me feel subhuman. </p>
<p>I don’t have any advice. Just came here to say it sucks for me too.</p>

<p>That's really a genius way of describing it. This feeling of shame and guilt that I get from being treated like some disgusting threat to life hurts in a way that's really unique and tough to articulate</p>

        <p>Sounds like you need to find a new area to frequent.  I am more of an outdoors kind of person and virtually no one I encounter on the bike trails and in recreation areas is wearing a mask around here. Most people are friendly and greet you as always or are willing to chat if you have time.</p>

        <p>You're venting, it's okay. I know a lot of people especially in the heavier hit countries are feeling a lot of frustration. I myself am worried for my relatives once the vaccine becomes a reality since it seems like such an uncertainty what the effects will be.</p>
<p>You're not as whiny as you think, there are a lot of posts like this. A lot of people are suffering mentally from these rules. <br>
Change of environment can help a lot in depression, so i think you've got the right idea about visiting your dad.</p>

        <p>I get really upset from being yelled at to wear masks, too.  You are not overreacting at all; it is normal to not want to be treated like a threat and to want to be valued (and want to see other people; I can relate to being the only one turning on their Zoom camera).</p>
<p>The situation with your boyfriend sounds concerning, especially when you say he would force you to quarantine.  Also the fact that you are not comfortable sharing your true thoughts with him for fear of being rejected.  From what you describe, it sounds like those fears might be justified.  I have never been in a romantic relationship before, but I have been around controlling people, and I hope you are able to make the right decisions for you.  I believe they should be treating you like an adult and respecting your right to make your own decisions.</p>

        <p>You should do everything possible to get away from New York and all far left places until those blows over. Which could be awhile. The difference from there and sane rural red states is night and day. Won't give you your life back but you won't have to put up with mask nazis either.</p>

        <p>Also, if you can't move, try googling some anti-mask group in NYC. Get in touch with them, explain your problems, say you just want to hang out. You're not alone, even if you live in a neurotic liberal NPC cesspool. Good luck.</p>

        <p>I live in Los Angeles and haven't seen my girlfriend in 3 weeks. We both live with very at risk loved ones and we're not interested in potentially exposing them from not quarantining/wearing a face mask/taking reasonable precautions, etc. </p>
<p>LITERALLY, we've both AGREED, that it's the safest thing to do. Don't you have a family member, neighbor or friend who's died of COVID? </p>
<p>I came on hear looking for advice about how to deal with COVID isolation and how to be strong during this tough time. </p>
<p>And I find this stupid bullshit. It's too bad your boyfriend doesn't really get it, poor guy. You sound completely selfish and your DECISIONS ARE THE EXACT REASON THIS THING IS SO OUT OF CONTROL. </p>
