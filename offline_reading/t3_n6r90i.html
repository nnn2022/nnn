    <strong>The reason for the lockdowns in the eyes of an elite group of corporate billionaires</strong>
    <p><p>The people instigating these methods of control, and trying to lock you indoors, are above the law.They create the law, because They are highly successful narcissists. People who can lie to themselves, in order to perceive that they are doing us a service of mercy.</p>
<p>Despite their multi-million dollar jets, which contribute to the climate change, They want You to stop.</p>
<p>You see, They make the Big Decisions. They control the Fates of billions.</p>
<p>7.8 Billion dollars sounds like a lot of money to You or i, but we're talking about 6.5 billion people, and trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>Americans saw so much money go to gender studies in pakistan during the initial debate over the stimulus bill. Why is some "virtue signalling" necessary during a pandemic? Government funded art museums?</p>
<p>because They think it's good for 7.8 billion people, It's why They serveil us.</p>
<p>Because it lines their pockets, so they can fund people projects, like epstein and his interests.</p>
<p>You see, They think the lockdowns will stop us from being animals. useless eaters. They feed us their interpretation of the world, while "We" revel in their waste.</p>
<p>We make their people more famous, and more rich.</p>
<p>This lockdown, and increasing digitization, seems to be what the people want, and it's "for our own good".</p>
<p>Narcissists can only see the positive effects of their actions, no matter how horrible. In a culture lead by narcissists, only narcissism can bloom. More time at home can only mean more time consuming their messages.</p>
<p>The new normal goes beyond the masks, your political ideologies, their control, or really anything that belongs to any single group.</p>
<p>The new normal is a self indulgent culture of narcissism in its most pure state. A mirror against a mirror, ad infinitum. It's just a shame that the people in control, no matter what We reject or accept, will always create what we see in any form of media. If you think that the major mods on popular, or most comments, of any social platform, are anything but corporations with bots in front of them, this post isn't for you.</p>
<p>We've enabled Their dominance, by buying into Their system. And most people have been convinced that it is for our own good, somehow. Even if you don't mask up. Even if you're Working an online gig from your van in a starbucks parking lot, a mile from where you're usually living off grid, We are all part of a narcissistic system, which is getting more self-indulgent, daily.</p>
<p>Sorry, stoned rant after working on some stuff</p>
<p>TL:DR- narcissists run this world. They promote their beliefs in every media source you could find, with narcissistic faces and voices on every media outlet. This perpetuates a pandemic of narcissism. A feedback loop. They think they are doing us a service by controlling us. If they can't, then population will have to decrease. But their industries, and private lives, are generally so extravagant, that if We abandoned them, and their Influence, we could probably live in a fairly civil manner.</p>
<p>Peace</p>
<p>edit: underestimated the population. lotta unifluential people in this world. So few in power. big club. etc etc</p>
<p>okay, gonna play re8 now</p></p>

        <p>It’s funny how people think we need government permission to leave our houses and live our lives; but we don’t need government permission to loot and burn a Target. In fact, we would have government support if we did that.</p>

        <p>Those who achieved wealth through hard work are usually humble and useful. It is undeserved super-wealth which seems to fry people's brains and turns them into reactionary gollum creatures.</p>

        <p>I can agree with that, however, when wealth generates wealth and fame through monetized platforming, it's quite easy to perpetuate nepotism, which leads to future control. see the sheen family for what i mean. oh yeah, or any other "royalty".</p>

        <p>That's what I mean by 'undeserved wealth'. It's not producing anything useful, and usually just rent-seeks off IP laws or something.</p>
