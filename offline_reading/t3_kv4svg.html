    <strong>We live in CCP China, but it's actually worse</strong>
    <p><p>Here is a realization I had: we are all afraid of criticizing the government and going against the pushed narrative, just like in China. Except, there is one main difference: many, or even most citizens are on the side of the authoritarians. In China (similarly to in middle century Eastern Europe like Poland, Czechia, Latvia, etc.) there seems to be a kind of solidarity of the working people, an understanding that the government and party line is bullshit, and people should stand together even when they might disagree. In the west now, what we have is basically a mob of frothing witch hunters, ready to arrest, inject, and subdue anyone who goes against the 'mandates', which at this point are not based on science, or even on provable hypotheses. And those people are the ones considered 'woke'. The fake authenticity of the media nowadays is the real issue. I'm maybe exaggerating a bit, places like this sub exist, and I frequently see comments on people's public social media dissenting, which is a good sign. However, I don't think it will get better, and I do think that this outcome is what some wanted...</p>
<p>If this gets censored it just further proves my point, I'll repost it.</p></p>

        <p>In China,  the people know the news is propaganda, and do not watch it.  In the west, most people haven't figured that out yet, and try and become "informed" from it.</p>

        <p>The biggest problem is that westerners for whatever reason trust their government. People that immigrated here from Italy, Poland, Slovakia, etc. They don't trust the government, they don't trust the police, they don't trust the schools. They know the group government doesn't give a shit about you. They know you are just a slave on the eyes of the government. </p>
<p>Native Canadians are legitimately stupid. They don't believe the government can be evil. They don't believe propaganda can be in a language other than Russian or Chinese. They ignore all the lies and corruption and cover up for the government.</p>

        <p>There's plenty of Chinese propaganda in Canada in the open.

        <p>For instance, take the recent news (in Ontario, Canada) that the big telecom companies shared people's phone geolocation/cell tower data with the media, so they could publish stories about the 'deviants' travelling within the province over the holidays... I have seen thousands of comments and posts on social media applauding this move and saying it should be used for even more extreme measures (to lock up those who travelled for instance). Long way of saying, people here are dumb.</p>

        <p>Well in China the majority of your working class are just kind of ok with everything. You gotta think how powerful China is and all the tech they have at their disposal. Most people in cities enjoy the comfort of phones, plentiful food and a cohesive society that's actually going somewhere. Most people you see speaking out against the government are the rural people who are still resisting being brought into the fold, like Tibet or Mongolia (or Taiwan or Hong Kong even though they're not rural). The real scary part is how America is moving towards the more controlling aspects of china's political structure to ensure the success of the oligarchy class, while not actually adopting the parts of China that make it such a superpower. Say what you will about China but the ability to create a 100 year plan for the future and actually act on it is more than could ever be hoped for in the west.</p>
