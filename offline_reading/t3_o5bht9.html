        <p>Guaranteed.</p>
<p>A sneaky trick ongoing right now, is to trick people into existing side by side "Vaccinated can remove mask, but other employees need Mask" and if this is accepted, it wont be long until the non-vaccinated will be pressured, either socially or through threat of losing their jobs.</p>

        <p>I'll take that bet. In most countries that have actually handled the covid situation decently and where people vaccinate, I really doupt there will be any kind of lockdown. Perhaps only some schools may have to have a class or two on distance studying for a couple of weeks, but otherwise it should be fairly easy.   </p>
<p>The only questions are about the mutated versions of virus.   </p>
<p>And concerning this post. You really should read up on what allowed this vaccine to be produced this fast. Here's a quick little video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-918sD2ygo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-918sD2ygo</a>  the specific point starts around 3 minute mark. It's not the video I first watched, that also explained that a reason why the vaccine was brought out so fast, was because this one actually had government backing. Meaning governments across the world were saying that we'll pay for a vaccine, just get us one that works. With the insurance that companies get their money back they could be more direct and bold in the research. However this video itself says that all the necessary steps have been taken.   </p>
<p>So, yeah, the meme's not that great and it's rather stupid.</p>

        <p>I hope so. But even Australia has to lock people down in their winter, look at all the new rules being rolled out. What's to stop the same thing happening in UK this winter. And someone even said cases are rising in UK now is that true?</p>

        <p>What exactly am I supposed to get from that link? That NZ banned travel to NSW because of winter? Well, yes coronavirus has shown to spread better in the winter. And since New Zealand was basically corona free, it's not surprising they wanna shut down flights if there's a risk of importing the illness. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However there's a huge difference between simply taking some measures of travel and the lockdown that was. If people act smart, wear masks when necessary, get vaccinated, then this crap will go over fairly simpler.</p>

<p>Now were I live (France), we are about 20% with double vaccination and about 40% with at least one vaccine; I checked yesterday the death cummul by days, there is NO difference between death of 2020 (who was a relatively rought year) vs 2021. So the promise are not here.</p>
<p>https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/4923977</p>
<p>In french so it will hard to understand. But you can check the 
'Nombre de déces depuis le 1er janvier 2021'  and see that mortality PER day didn't change comparing to 2020.</p>
<p>So if vaccination work, they don't decrease mortality rate as I was expecting. Not with 6 month of intense vaccination.</p>

        <p>Taiwan barely experienced death. Never locked down, never mandated masks. They just carried on like normal. It's amazing when doctors are allowed, at least in Taiwan, to treat their patients as they see fit using readily available medicine without any fear of losing your medical license.</p>

<p>Very few people died in early 2020 from the virus. The yellow line (2021) is between the red (2020) and the blue (2019) during the first wave, which is the only period that you can really compare. The 2021 line goes under the other two in the latest dates available, so it literally shows it works.</p>

        <p>Each country made mistakes as the situation was developing, but i'm quite happy with mine, for example. I know there were mess-ups with schools being closed and opened unevenly, but people were given information and measures were put in place to reduce the spread. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But you do realize you're comparing the beginning of the pandemic, which was halted by summer and the second wave? <br>
Are you actually saying that France having as many deaths now, during the big second wave of the pandemic and during the beginning of the pandemic, is a bad thing?   </p>
<p>During the beginning of the pandemic, I think the highest number of new sick people per day was around 40-50. During the second wave, we had days of 300+.   </p>
<p>To give an example you're comparing putting water on a house that's starting to burn and a house that's in flames. If indeed, during the second pandemic wave the deaths in France didn't rise, that's a good thing, don't you agree? What about the amount of deaths compared to illnesses, did you check that? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Google "France statistics coronavirus" and then look at the graph that shows "deaths" and graph that shows "cases". New cases per day (7 day avg)  during the early 2020 peak was around 4.5 - 5k. New cases per day during 2021 march was 37-39k  </p>
<p>However if you look at the deaths, then 2020 beginning was average around 900, whereas 2021 march it's around 300. <br>
You can make your deductions from that.</p>

        <p>Cult of the Mask is benefiting far too much from all of this, be it from simple virtue-signaling and smugness to ability to act authoritarian and superior over others, to even collecting real $$$ to continue playing scared, the victim and oppressed (Canada pays covid19 benefits).</p>
<p>Also with their mental illness and irrationality and absolute inability to take responsibility for their own fears, aversion to risk and thirst for a 100% safespace for themselves, why would we ever expect them to want this to end?</p>
<p>It's pretty much us perfectly healthy and free People who are sick of having our human rights trampled on, having food, medicine, work, employment and businesses suspended to perpetuate this crap - and watching our economy being destroyed, who want this to end ASAP.</p>
<p>STILL STILL Mask mandates for months and months and months..in BC, AB and Canada... with no oversight, no review, no discussion... no longer temporary, and your right to breathe properly is in the hands of one individual.. </p>
<p>They went from '2 weeks then we will review' to 'indefinite time and X results"... This is not fair or democratic.. and should be extremely alarming to people that they have granted themselves power to restrict you for as long as THEY feel like it.</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines have been in research circles for years. We didn't bring them to clinical use because we didn't have to, because we haven't had to make new vaccines in a hurry for a while, and so no one wanted to fund distribution. When the pandemic hit, that changed.</p>
<p>Review article from 2018, pre pandemic, that summarizes progress that has already been made on mRNA vaccines:
https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243</p>
<p>From there, what's so great about mRNA vaccines is that they're adaptable to new diseases easily, making them easy to make quickly.</p>

        <p>Because with each new disease they have to sequence a new genetic code, which infects every cell of your body imitating hiv in the way it uses healthy cells to replicate and replace with new gene coded cell clusters.
These have life long side effects that are generationally transferable to your offspring.</p>
<p>More study is needed before this becomes the new eugenics ethos of gattaca style classification of citizenry based off of genetic markers.</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? That's like saying "Well, a glass of water is safe, therefore a glass of cyanide is also safe".</p>
<p>The payload is what matters. It's what the mRNA is instructed to do and whether or not it's behaving properly that is the concern. These are things you have to test if you want to do good science. You can't just code some mRNA instructions into a vaccine and hope for the best. Well, I guess you can, but that's pretty irresponsible and anti-scientific.</p>
