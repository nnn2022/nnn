<title>In 2018, journalists wrote about the 80,000+ flu deaths that occurred that year. Two years later and that has been memory holed. The figures have been retroactively changed to 61,000 deaths. Will the Chinese cold suffer a similar fate?</title>

    <strong>In 2018, journalists wrote about the 80,000+ flu deaths that occurred that year. Two years later and that has been memory holed. The figures have been retroactively changed to 61,000 deaths. Will the Chinese cold suffer a similar fate?</strong>
    <p><p>If you search through a few pages of search results, you can find news articles about the 2018 flu season deaths of that year. Such as <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/26/cdc-us-flu-deaths-winter/">this one</a>, or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/flu-deaths-2017--2018-cdc-bn/index.html">this one.</a></p>
<p>They say the same thing: 80,000+ deaths. To quote the relevant part:</p>
<p>&rt;NEW YORK — An <strong>estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu</strong> and its complications last winter — the disease’s highest death toll in at least four decades.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;CDC officials do not have exact counts of how many people die from flu  each year. Flu is so common that not all flu cases are reported, and flu  is not always listed on death certificates. So <strong>the CDC uses statistical  models, which are periodically revised, to make estimates.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;CDC officials called the 80,000 figure preliminary, and it may be slightly revised. But they said <strong>it is not expected to go down.</strong></p>
<p>Ok. So the CDC had used its super scientific models to conclude that 80,000 Americans died of the flu in the 2018 flu season, and only expected the estimate to go up, and not down. Sounds good so far.</p>
<p>The interesting problem comes, and perhaps some of you know this, when we compare this to the numbers currently on the CDC's website for the 2018 flu season: 61,000 deaths. We can see on their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018/archive.htm">archived page</a> for the 2018 season that while they were initially confident in their 80,000+ deaths, it was later revised at an unspecified date to state that there were only 61,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Isn't that fascinating? The 2018 flu season was hyped by CNN and other media outlets as one of the worst and most deadly in our history. We were told over 80,000 people died. </p>
<p>Then, without fanfare or media announcement, those figures were changed. Now we are told that only 61,000 people died.</p>
<p>Which is the truth? Is either the truth? What is the reason for changing the figures so long after the fact, by so much? How could the super-scientific estimating models be so far off the mark? </p>
<p>And finally, and perhaps most important: will COVID-19 (or the Chinese Cold, as I like to call it) get the same treatment? </p>
<p>Two years from now, will the CDC update the estimated figures to show that there were actually only 75% as many deaths as initially thought?</p>
<p>If we compare deaths from coronavirus this year, to flu data from 2018 before it was <em>revised,</em> is everything going on a lot less scary? Is that, perhaps, why the 2018 flu season mortality data was revised?</p>
<p>Food for thought.</p></p>

        <p>Hmmmm, very insidious on their part. Clearly numbers were changed in 2018 (whenever they changed) to continue with the fear mongering now. The dishonesty is disgusting. Looking forward to hearing what others think.</p>
