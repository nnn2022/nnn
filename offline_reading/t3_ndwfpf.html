<title>WITH doesn't mean FROM! Wow the Covidians finally agree! Finally they understand. But maybe they only apply this when talking about vaccines and not the ones who didn't have vaccines. They are an incredibly irrational bunch.</title>

        <p>They'll somehow argue that "it's different" when presented with this info. Guaranteed</p>

        <p>Yes but won't be able to rationally explain why, because the only difference is their feelings.  Which has essentially been all of this.</p>

        <p>I said on another post,</p>
<p>Now vaxxed people positive with Covid and asymptomatic don't spread. So if you get the vaccine and test positive for Covid, if you have no symptoms, you can't spread Covid.</p>
<p>Getting a vaccine doesn't change whether asymptomatic people spread or not. Either asymptomatic people spread covid or they don't. Vaccines aren't a code update to where people magically don't spread anymore. That or Asymptomatic people didn't spread Covid in the first place.</p>
<p>I believe asymptomatic people do spread, but if they aren't coughing and sneezing, or touching their face, then they aren't likely to spread any virus. By wearing a mask and constantly touching everything, all asymptomatic persons became extremely contagious.</p>
<p>Back to the point, I hate how people can't see the science isn't being standardized. Either "from" isn't the same thing as "with", or it is the same thing. Either asymptomatic people spread or they don't spread. Both these contexts can't miraculously change if you got a vaccine.</p>
<p>One more thing, catching Covid naturally is just as effective if not more than getting a vaccine.</p>
