        <p>They stop spit, but then the spit dries and the virus (assuming you have it and it exits your mouth when you sneeze) is left in the mask to be pushed out with every breath or left on every surface the mask touches. A mask isn’t a black hole that destroys virus, the virus is still in the mask. </p>
<p>Until this year a medical mask was treated as contaminated PPE that needed to be properly disposed of. Now we’re jamming them into pockets and purses and tossing them on tables.</p>
<p>Masks are absolutely spreading the virus. It’s far more hygienic to sneeze into a tissue you then throw away or at the very least, your arm sleeve that you’re not breathing through the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the award, love finding people who agree!</p>

        <p>I've always been a bit on the crazy side regarding cleanliness of tables...if I drop food on the table I won't eat it in case it got dirty, in a restaurant I would keep my utensils on the serviette so they didn't touch the table, etc. I couldn't imagine anyone who's worried about germs actually wearing a mask that was lying on a table!</p>

        <p>You can't predicted how many times you sneeze in a day with a mask you dont need to use a diffrent one every time.</p>
<p>You won't where a mask for the inconvenience but you will carry a travel pack everywhere you go? It seems like you just want to complain.</p>
<p>Also sneezing isn't the ONLY reason to where a mask. </p>
<p>If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.</p>

        <p>No I don’t want to wear a used tissue on my face all day, sorry if that’s unhygienic to you. Toilet paper and napkins can also be used if you run out. Again, not rocket science. You don’t have a finite number of tissues in your pocket to start the day and are just SOL when they’re out. The Kleenex police won’t come arrest you for using some napkins or paper towels or toilet paper.</p>
<p>The mask isn’t a black hole that destroys a virus. It may stop saliva, but then your saliva dries and what’s left? The virus. A virus small enough to go through any fabric, even that of a surgical mask. So now the virus that you could have just thrown away on a tissue is being dispensed into the atmosphere with every breath because you decided strapping a used tissue to your face was hygienic.</p>

        <p>I never said a mask was a black whole dumbass.</p>
<p>I said its safer then trusting evyone yo carry tissue on them 24 fucking 7 and surgical masks absorb liquids thats the fuxking point of them so it not the same as a used tissue and what the fuck are you supposed to do when there is no bathroom around? At the end of the day masks are better and more convenient but if you would rather go cry about it and and complain like a fucking baby then go ahead.</p>

        <p>So sneeze into your arm. Do I really have to explain the concept of covering a cough or sneeze to you? If you need a tissue literally strapped to your face for convenience, maybe I do need to explain it.</p>

        <p>I coughed into my arm and it didn’t push my arm away. If I have sleeves on the fabric fills any gap. And as a bonus, I don’t then have to hang that contaminated fabric on my face and breathe through snot. </p>
<p>If your cough does that to your arm, I wonder what it does to a mask? Like surely the mask isn’t making a perfect seal. A cough that explosive would come out all sides of it. </p>

        <p>Flat lungs? Coughing up dust? Lol what are you even talking about? </p>
<p>Retardation? I’m not the one wearing a used snot rag on my face because I’m too lazy to cover my cough. Do you wear diapers because you’re too lazy to go to the bathroom?</p>

        <p>Yes it's just a false sense of security.</p>
<p>The amount of people I know that wear the same mask 5-6 times before washing or changing them.</p>
<p>People go into a shop wear a mask touch everything, the card machines, the doors, then do not use hand sanitizer, take off the mask, touch their faces, hair..</p>

        <p>i just burned a couple of disposable surgical masks that i've been wearing every day to and from the office since June. JUNE. it's OCTOBER. that's FIVE MONTHS. </p>
<p>frankly, i don't want to know what was living in and on my mask last night when i chucked it onto the barbie and watched it fry.</p>
<p>plus, i'm touching my face constantly so that's probably normal and healthy and good.</p>
<p>the only thing the mask has done is forced viruses to aerosolize as they're pushed through the membranes of the mask, so instead of heavier droplets falling, we have little aerosols floating. </p>
<p>mmmm aerosol cloud so many viruses so little time mmmmmmm</p>

        <p>It's evidence that its not deadly.</p>
<p>Tell you what I do with something that's really deadly. I dealt with hydrochloric acid few weeks ago. I wore something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://guide.alibaba.com/t-shop/3m-6200-6002-protective-masks-hydrochloric-acid-hydrofluoric-acid-gas-masks-seven-sets_11380045.html">https://guide.alibaba.com/t-shop/3m-6200-6002-protective-masks-hydrochloric-acid-hydrofluoric-acid-gas-masks-seven-sets_11380045.html</a></p>
<p>And I also have to wear clinical gloves. Unlike what horror movies and fiction tell you, having HCL on your skin doesn't mean you'll burn instantly as you go "I'mmmm melting!". No, the dead skin cells actually protect you from that, for few dozen seconds.</p>
<p>The part that needs to be protected from such acids are your eyes, and your lungs. Breathed in fumes from one chemical and I felt a strong irritation in my nasal cavity.</p>
<p>If you use such gas masks often enough, you also have to replace the filters. Except with cloth and even N95 masks, the mask itself is the filter, which can be contaminated and its integrity damaged by touching your face.</p>
<p>Talk about much ado about nothing.</p>

        <p>Another thing I wonder is if masks could actually increase viral load because it would mostly be trapped within the mask, possibly making a potential infection worse.</p>

        <p>I half-jokingly made this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jhs8e5/weekly_nonewnormal_chatventsupport_post/ga9f7r9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">comment</a> to some pro-mask Redditor who keeps pushing their agenda in this sub. The joke being they're intentionally killing grandma but the gist of it being true - the average person wearing a mask does not know how to wear a mask. </p>
<p>And since masks became mandatory, people can't seem to keep an appropriate distance. I've never been one to invade people's personal space and I'm pretty uncomfortable with beings.</p>
