    <strong>The greatest contradiction</strong>
    <p><p>So according to one of my colleagues who was browsing the news on her phone today Merkel might tighten down on the lockdown, giving us curfews and shutting down public transit which is shitty news for all of us who can't visit the adult care facility anymore because of this and also shitty news to me since I am planning to visit my mothers grave on the anniversary of her death.</p>
<p>I don't know yet how accurate these news are (though considering all the other crap Merkel has pulled over these last years I wouldn't put it past her), but what frustrated me more was the discussions among my colleagues.</p>
<p>See, in true fashion they of course blamed corona critics and deniers for all of this, arguing that if only everyone would follow the guidelines we wouldn't be in this situation anymore... even though 99% are already following the guidelines.
They then claimed that all those 'idiots' putting other people at risk by not following the guidelines are only doing it because they don't see the virus as a credible threat... and then two colleagues admitted that they aren't personally afraid of the virus themselves, that "if something happens, it happens" and that they mostly follow the mandates since they are told to by the government.</p>
<p>And yet they saw fit to shit on corona critics and deniers...</p>
<p>I think my brain just short-circuited listening to that conversation.</p></p>
