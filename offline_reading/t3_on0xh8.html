    <strong>As reality gets crazier, it becomes more concerning how many people can’t see it......</strong>
    <p><p>Never before in history has there been such a large brainwashed population. Think about it; when has reality differed SO much and SO obviously that people  seriously couldn’t see it?</p>
<p>They’re expecting the media to come out and tell them that their goal is global government and they’re gonna control you. We have Klaus Schwab, Fauci, Peter Dazec, Gates, all OBVIOUSLY not to be trusted, yet using psychological cult tactics causing people to <em>actually</em> trust in them, and the vaccine. </p>
<p><strong>We’re not in a very good place.</strong></p>
<p>Sorry to be a downer, but to have one side of humanity boiling up with genocidal rhetoric, the government so blatantly corrupt, the intelligence agencies so “incompetent” but really they’re in on it, the vaccine clearly being unfit for further use while mandates are being forced on people, <em>plenty</em> of evidence that this vaccine will lead to infertility and death, yet the narrative continues along.</p>
<p>When will the public consciousness wake up to realize we’re all being taken over by globalists? This should concern literally everyone. No popular and common political ideology includes stakeholder capitalism at the severe expense of one of their sudden “smaller stakeholders (us)”, technocratic surveillance, severe political destabilization, famine, more bio weapons, a genocide of billions of people openly talked about in many cases (never forget **Bill Gates called the vaccines the “Final Solution” and people didn’t care), and a post industrial feudal system? </p>
<p><strong>Think about it. When has there ever, EVER been such a large cult. Could we agree?</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much evidence there is, too many people put their trust in the establishment to be motivated to see their evil plans. The vaccine being a deadly bio weapon isn’t a thing a vaccinated person would get excited to hear. It’s a crazy crazy world we live in and I only hope history tells the story right.</p></p>

        <p>I keep returning to the Great Delusion as depicted in the Bible, so this is not a surprise.</p>
<p>They literally cannot see it. They never wanted to, never developed virtue and morality and ethics, and embraced their selfishness instead.</p>
<p>This is supposed to be the result. Be glad you are not one of them.</p>

        <p>It's God pretty much shrugging his shoulders, as these people have turned their backs on him so hard, and have been reveling in their own evil and actions , that he just lets leaves them to it... and they drown in their own shit.</p>
<p>Pretty much it means they will be blinded to all of this and will end up being the first victims of it, and will suffer the worst of it.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean we're safe, but we're at least able to see it happening and prepare for it.</p>

        <p>Just to chime and possibly help. To prepare spiritually is to remove yourself from this world and to go back to your first love (God). That means things like following the 10 commandments, observing the sabbath (it’s his seal), reading his word, spreading the truth and repenting/not sinning. Just my personal interpretation of things I could be off but that’s what my family has been doing. I’m not a Christian but I felt this guide was good for studying if you want. </p>

        <p>Weird reddit name for somebody who isn't a Christian... anyways Jesus famously battled Pharisees who sought to accuse him for healing on the sabbath and performing miracles and even eating forbidden food on sabbath...Jesus rebuked them and said if their sheep fell into a ditch on the sabbath would they not lift it out of the ditch? The sabbath is a jewish law which Jesus came to fulfill but also to get rid of these type of dictates and rigid laws and dietary restrictions etc. Jesus fulfilled the law, and made a new covenant with man. Not saying the 10 commandments should not be followed but observing the sabbath I would argue is situational. I think the sabbath can be any moment you can rest and give glory to God... that is my opinion... But Jesus, again, rebuked the rigidity of those laws. Love your brother as yourself. And do not do what you hate.... I will try to take the second one to heart which is how I am preparing... I hate wearing a mask and submitting to theatrical infectious disease theater that I know is wrong in the physical dimension as well as the spiritual and is a humiliation to myself as a man made in the image of God... so I will resolve to never put a face covering on again... and to never abide by these new normal religions. I hate them.</p>

        <p>I agree with a lot you said too btw. Just not about the laws but I’m no expert so don’t look at is as an opposition but as discussion. As far as the unclean things I do not believe that even though I know it is said in the Bible that what goes to a mans stomach cannot defile him. It can make man sick which is why I believe it was a law in the first place.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to be a Christian to believe in the Bible or Gods word. Secondly, his name was not “Jesus” whether he was Hebrew or Jew or both he would have not been given a Greek name which only existed for a few hundred years. I’m sorry but that is deception he came to fulfill not abolish. That means he came to show people the correct way to live. It is not just a “Jewish” law, hence why God said it is a sign between me and my people. It is his seal. To love the son is to love the father and to love the father is to keep his laws and commandments.</p>

        <p>I did buy a gun (not sure if I’d even use it at this point), ammo, and months worth of survival food. To be honest I don’t think there’s anything you can physically do or have. </p>
<p>I’m a marine and the one thing they always told us was you cannot realistically prepare for war and everything that will happen in war. You can only train for possibilities. If this is really it, we have strong faith and are prepared to die or leave everything behind.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your service. </p>
<p>If the marines or the whole military got orders to take action against their own people, how do you think that would go?</p>
<p>I’ve seen videos of National Guard sweeping streets doing gun confiscation drills after hurricane Katrina, and that made me really sad Bc I assumed the military would never obey an order like that. I want to trust that our military is first and foremost concerned with our freedom (not necessarily safety)</p>

        <p>Thank you and some would probably follow orders unfortunately, while others would quit. Some would fear the consequences if they didn’t and others would be brainwashed into believing it’s “their duty” or “they’re just doing their job.” I’ve heard some say they’ll take it and do whatever because of the time they invested. 🤷🏾‍♂️ </p>
<p>It’s also because some of the top leaders are also involved in all of this. Remember how the vaccine went to the military first? Yea they tell military members they can’t travel (take their leave), they’ll suffer the military justice system or they’ll get a dishonorable discharge if they don’t get it. It’s mostly all talk right now besides the leave part. </p>
<p>(Disclaimer: this is my personal opinion and I do not speak for the Marines or any military service branch.)</p>

        <p>Look up the npc meme. A lot of them may be placeholders and not have souls. Like extras on a movie set. I like this better than thinking so many are facing damnation or hellfire. But I do think that there are those that will face a fate like that... such as Bill Gates and Soros... Rockefellers, Klaus Schwabb... those people. But this very well may be the beginning of the delusion in the bible... and the decisions made now may be biblical... 2 men are working in a field. One will be taken and the other left. Brother against brother, and so on. These willful takers of mrna... I hesitate to say willful because of the mkultra style lobotomy most have undergone via the media... so it may be the beginning... it may make those susceptible to delusion and those who did not seek God like the other commentor said... it may be these decisions open them up easier down the road for the true separation and mark of the beast. I would say this could be the rapture and they are sheep chosen by God but the vileness with which they push the vaxx on people and hate free thought and freedom tells me this is not the case. Sorry I am drunk.</p>

        <p>It is a cult. My local jizz-rag of a paper just had a “Vaccine Issue” where the editor and bobble headed assistant had a discussion about trying to get people vaccinated. The editor said, “you know, the biggest side effect we really have been seeing with the vaccine is gratitude” 🤢</p>

        <p>Similar story here. I remember in school always asking why? How do you know? Back then although annoyed with me teachers for the most part would entertain my questions. In college the questioning stopped and I knew to answer tests etc with what I was told to pass and get out.
When did questioning become so bad... forbidden even.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure the issue is control of information per se. Unless you’re living in CCP China or North Korea most people living in modern countries have access to the information that is relevant here.</p>
<p>The problem is people have been brainwashed for several generations in a row to trust the government and trust the TV.</p>
<p>That wasn’t how people generally thought 100 years ago, now it’s become so normalized due to the power of narrative centralization and movies and TV that you have multiple generations brainwashed in a way we’ve never seen before in history.</p>
<p>The irony of all of it is that this information is still available in the west, it’s as easy as a few google searches, but people are so ignorant and don’t know that they don’t know that they don’t even bother looking....</p>

        <p>Show me one example of a western internet company censoring access to independent doctors or scientists websites showing this information? Direct censorship like your browser literally can’t load the website?</p>
<p>The internet companies aren’t, it’s social media companies that are, which again goes back to what I said. People are brainwashed to believe everything through a filter, that includes TV and Facebook fact checkers.</p>
<p>The information is out there and available, even as much as google tries to censor if you try hard enough you can find it.</p>
<p>The primary problem is people don’t even know they are being lied to because they trust the system so much and the prospect of all of covid being a lie is so terrifying most wont even look.</p>

        <p>Thing is I can blend in the crowd when I'm out, but once they start harvesting internet data, we're all screwed.</p>
<p>In the lead up to the end of the Vietnam war, the south Vietnamese government, foreseeing their demise, shredded as many documents containg "incriminating" information to prevent the Communists from tracking down former ARVN / members of South government. They then burnt as many of these strips as they could, but some were as slips. </p>
<p>After the fall of Saigon, the north Vietnamese went through the painstaking process of matching these strips, and then locating the associated names ( so that they could execute them or send them to re-education camps)</p>
<p>These "slips" of data are scattered throughout the internet, and they can (and will) be used to track you down.</p>

        <p>I don't think we're all fucked. Half the world doesn't agree with this dystopian BS. The psychopaths can only deal with so many at a time, and my feeling is they're going to go after people who actually try to block their plans. People complaining on the internet list has to be up around a billion or so of us... Maybe that's a delusion of safety in numbers, I don't know. I made a decision though that I was going to express myself about the "new normal" whatever list it gets me on, and I'm not sorry. I just could NOT stay silent any more, and I feel a lot better being a part of this support group for the non-crazy :) Even if (worst case) it shortens my life, at least each day from now until then is much higher quality.</p>

        <p>I think the worst part is that it’s not even a large part of society that is bubbling up with genocidal sentiments, just a very influential part. They lead the masses who are, truthfully, incredibly apathetic. The disgusting apathy is what’s going to ruin this society and this world. People who don’t know what to think, how to think, why to think. They won’t do anything,  but they’ll join in on whatever they think their friends will like. We need more passion.</p>

        <p>I've talked to a few people about the plans the elites have in store for us. Majority couldnt care less. They are perfectly content with ignoring the obvious while solely focusing on enjoying their lives by going along with the idiotic mandates. They care more for conforming than standing their grounds. What boggles my mind is how blaze they are concerning their health. Showing them evidence of people who got hurt doesnt deter them from getting the vaccine. No, they want to go on vacation and will comply in order to make that a reality. They have no principles and would put their bodily integrity on the line for such trivial distractions. One of these people said " If I die from the vaccine it was my time to go. It was fate". Yes, injection yourself with a poison chemical and dying from it is called fate. You cant make this backward logic up. </p>
<p>In a way this pandemic has brought about some positive aspects. </p>
<ul>
<li>it revealed all the broken and corrupt systems in our society that we rely on. </li>
<li>our leaders have sold us out and that our current political system need to be overtrown</li>
<li>how easily people are indoctrinated and subjugated.</li>
<li>how stupid and docile the common man really is dispite his/her IQ</li>
<li>Health Care is about treating symptoms and not tackling the cure. Science is highly political; therefore truth is not always regarded as most important.</li>
<li>we are slaves living in an glassed cage. But many people dont see it. We are not truely free. So many restrictions and taxations. </li>
</ul>
<p>I dont want to live in this society anymore. I will gladly give up all my luxury to live a simple life in nature. We have diverged too much from mother nature. Time for a total reset.</p>
<p>People are now openly talking about a parallel society. I for one am all for it. Let people who want to enjoy their surfitude and comfort remain slaves to the system. Other that yearn for something better, let them create their new eden.</p>

        <p>I honestly think the globalists didn't predict SO MANY people falling for it, all across the political and social spectrum.</p>
<p>That's probably why they're leaking things about the lab and talking about side effects in the news. They need to sow more doubt it some, to drive the divide that will lead to us killing each other. There actually are not enough skeptics at the moment for their goals to be met.</p>

        <p>Lmao, for COVID I agree. It warranted no response. Show me a purified lab sample of this virus obtained from a real patient? You won’t be able to because none exist. I have a background in evolutionary biology, the shamdemic seemed off from the beginning when there was no reservoir species. None of the facts line up.</p>
