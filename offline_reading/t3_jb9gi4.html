<p>Nothing would dismantle the human experience if you chucklefucks would just stop doing unnecessary shit and wear a mask for a bit.</p>
<p>We would have been able to have a semi-normal human experience by now if you fucks would have just  stopped being foolish and thought about the world around you for once.</p>

<p>You know, this person is making a good point, even if they don't know it. Humans are social animals. We need to be around others. We needed it when we were hunting animals in small packs and we need it together, whether we get that at a bar or a school or a church. So social interaction absolutely is a need.</p>

        <p>Their point is that social interaction doesn't require being in a crowded bar during a pandemic, like they said. It's definitely possible to see friends safely right now - in small groups away from others, ideally outside or with masks on.</p>

        <p>Being outdoors allows any virus particles being expelled by an infected person to disperse before they are inhaled in a concentration high enough likely to cause infection in someone else, especially if some distance is maintained between people. Masks primarily work by containing enough expelled virus particles to prevent spread, while offering some protection from breathing in a high load of infected particles from others. While 100% safety may be impossible to achieve, these strategies are about as close as it gets without completely isolating. The more people participate, the better they work.</p>
<p>A crowded bar is not <strong>as</strong> safe because being indoors prevents that wide dispersal of expelled infected breath, and drinking requires at least temporary removal of masks. Alcohol is likely to lower the adherence to protections that keep people safe from the virus. In any crowded indoor environment, it's more difficult to control the distance between yourself and people who may or may not be infected.</p>
<p>If you don't have any friends, there are plenty of outdoor activities where you are just as likely, if not more, to find some with common interests than at a crowded bar. My recent adventures have taken me to outdoor beer gardens, dog parks, neighborhood trash pick-ups, historic district walking tours, nature hikes, and outdoor fitness classes. As in pre-coronavirus times, socializing takes some initiative an effort.</p>

        <p>I just don't understand why you say small groups are safer: how do you know they are safer? You say a lot of shit but no facts behind them. Where is the science? Where is the data?</p>

        <p>You don't think that a small group of friends that for the most part only spends time with each other outside is safer than a different mix of a hundred strangers in a crowded room every time you go out? How can you possibly think the risk is the same?</p>

        <p>Yes. You see, I'm looking for facts. You seem a bit foggy on the concept so let me give you some examples. Here's a fact: in my state, NY, <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/coronavirus/2020/03/16/bars-restaurants-gyms-movie-theaters-casinos-new-york-state">the governor closed bars and restaurants on 3/16.</a> You see that blue thing? It's called a citation. Fact, citation. See a pattern?</p>
<p>But wait it gets better. Not only can you share facts, but you can use them to construct an <em>argument</em>! This is really neat. To return to NY, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/new-york-coronavirus-cases.html">on this page, you'll see a graph that shows the deaths in NY over time.</a> According to that graph, deaths were basically flat on 3/16 (the day bars and restaurants were closed), before shooting straight up and peaking on 4/13. Hmm. If closing bars and restaurants is so important to "stop the spread," how could that be? </p>
<p>And before you say, "Imagine how much higher the death rate would be if NY hadn't closed bars," let me point out that NY's death is so high, <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/states-comparison">not only is it the highest in the country,</a> but if NY were its own country, <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">it would have the highest death rate in the world.</a> If that's the case how could NY's death rate even have gotten higher?</p>
<p>But we don't have to speculate that COVID-19 spread wasn't affected by the stay at home orders. We know for a fact that the majority of people in NY who got COVID-19, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/ny-gov-cuomo-says-its-shocking-most-new-coronavirus-hospitalizations-are-people-staying-home.html">66%, <em>were</em> staying home. Another 18% were from nursing homes.</a> If most people who got COVID 19 were staying home that would suggest to me that the stay at home orders did jack shit.</p>
<p>And of course, how could we forget Sweden, the one country that had no lockdowns, never closed bars and restaurants, and only had a few light restrictions (nothing compared to NY). <a href="https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/se">Let's look at its death rate, shall we?</a> Hmm. Looks identical to NY's to me. That suggests that lockdowns accomplished jack shit. </p>
<p>In fact, I see no reason why NY should't reopen everything. It seems we're done with COVID 19, and nothing we've done has altered its path. But what do I know? Who needs facts and reasons when you've got "7 month's worth of information, and common sense???"</p>

        <p>I could certainly provide sources that show how particles disperse more widely in the practically unlimited volume of our breezy atmosphere compared to an enclosed room with questionable ventilation if you need them in order to comprehend the concept. We could try some math exercises to demonstrate the probabilities of contracting a virus from the same small group of people who are consistent with their mask usage and aversion to crowded spaces, and from ever-changing large groups of people whose behavior exhibits total disregard for protecting themselves or the people around them if it would make you feel better. I'd be happy to point you in the direction of some social activities if you need a friend. I'll even be your friend myself! How are you doing? Did you have a good day?</p>
<p>I never advocated for lockdowns so I'm not sure why you're so focused on that. My posts have been about individuals taking personal responsibility for their own health and being considerate of the health of others. That has nothing to do with government-mandated lockdowns. I'm in favor of everything remaining open for the sake of the economy if people are willing to wear a mask indoors and take any activity that's hindered by a mask outside or to their own homes. Maintaining a social life and taking precautions to avoid the virus are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>I wish you were right in that we're done with COVID-19, but I have yet to see a shred of evidence that indicates as much.</p>
