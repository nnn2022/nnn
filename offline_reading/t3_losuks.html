    <strong>How to defend against sheep’s when returning to work after COVID-19 Survival Guide.</strong>
    <p><p>Yo, 23 M had Wu-Flu like a week ago. When you return to work these are these things that will happen with absolute certainty. </p>
<p>•Co-worker shaming, varies between levels of bullshit tolerance, some will ask how you’ve been with a smile, others will tremble with terror of muh virus around you.</p>
<p>•COVIDIOT- you are now the covidiot.</p>
<p>•Leper status- you are contagious, always, forever, and no matter what.</p>
<p>•Mask?- Co-workers will gleefully remove masks to converse and eat while simultaneously scolding you for removing yours for any reason. </p>
<p>Myths- “you don’t get immunity after COVID, you can still catch and spread the virus at anytime”. Said as they schedule a vaccine appointment to be injected with COVID for immunity. </p>
<p>Basically, you’ll be treated by the mass stupidity as a bio hazard 4ever. </p>
<p>And I’ll be making my money and chilling with a whiskey post shift every night.  </p>
<p>Good luck guys.</p></p>
