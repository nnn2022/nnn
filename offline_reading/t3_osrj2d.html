        <p>I recently heard this song on Spotify for the first time in several years and it's crazy how the message is still relevant 10 years later. Lyrics:</p>
<p>[Chorus]<br>
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit<br>
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets<br>
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?<br>
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?<br>
Uh, And a bunch of other coverups<br>
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts<br>
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut<br>
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up<br>
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust<br>
You get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough<br>
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of "what the fucks"<br>
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such<br>
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homey, that's the news<br>
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth<br>
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist<br>
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit<br>
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either<br>
I'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful<br>
And I believe in the people, yeah<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Now we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it<br>
But if we know better, then we probably deserve it<br>
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?<br>
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant<br>
And you are not a Muslim<br>
Israel don't take my side cause look how far you've pushed them<br>
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went<br>
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?<br>
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?<br>
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop<br>
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt<br>
If you don't become an actor, you'll never be a factor<br>
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt<br>
Wash them down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells<br>
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today<br>
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence<br>
Fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it<br>
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth<br>
So scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you<br>
Sometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to<br>
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you<br>
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few<br>
My screams is finally getting free,<br>
My thoughts is finally yelling through<br>
[Chorus]</p>

        <p>Great track! Loved this album.</p>
<p>There are a lot of OGs in entertainment that feel this way; we'll just rarely hear from them.</p>

        <p>It was strange to see him pushing the vax on his Instagram. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I still like the message at the end of this song</p>
