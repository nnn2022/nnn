<p>But this was not clear in that March 25 guidance, Assemblyman Kevin  Byrne pointed out, saying that nursing homes felt they did not have an  option at all. </p>
<p>Senator Patrick Gallivan also pressed Dr. Zucker, saying that there  were in fact facilities that did ask for help and for their residents to  be transferred. </p>
<p>Dr. Zucker continued to disagree saying that no one reached out. “We were available.</p></p>

        <p>Are they really gonna let the narrative become symptomless infected workers spread the virus amongst the homes when there was a fucking mandate for the longest time direct from Cuomo forcing actual covid patients in there? The governor should be guilty of practicing eugenics by knowing what the outcome would be and still doing that. This just drives me nuts.</p>

        <p>Occam's razor really does prevail here, doesn't it? Cuomo did not want to have these people risk being contagion vectors for the not old, and so the risk of putting them with the old people and dooming them to death was preferable to the idea that this potentially deadly en masse disease would be in an arguably public place.</p>
<p>I can see the logic, here. Of course I can also see the thought patterns of a sociopath, but it makes sense given the time frame</p>
