    <strong>Property rights, the vaccine, and you.</strong>
    <p><p>Property rights are the most basic of freedoms, from which all else follows. Remove those, and soon nothing will be left.</p>
<p>The State has been busily chipping away at property rights for years. We have grown accustomed to "eminent domain" seizures - usually sanctioned by corrupt city and municipal administrations in cahoots with developers. We see seizures of property and assets under "administrative forfeiture" rules - where unproven criminal accusations are used to strip people of everything before a case is even proven in a court of law. Even if the person is found innocent, they find themselves in the position of having to fight to get their property back.</p>
<p>The last two generations have been "educated" to place no value on property rights. We busily create a "society of renters", where everything is ephemeral, everything is monetized, and your life is a "subscription service" - designed to keep you paying forever. We use "social justice" to stir up resentment and envy of those who are successful - and dare to enjoy the fruits of their success. We allow governments to steal and redistribute over half of our income in taxes - and it is redistributed to those who feel they have a right to it merely by the virtue of their existence. They see <em>you</em>r property as <em>theirs</em> - and their views are enforced by the coercive power of the State.</p>
<p>Our would-be masters at the WEF intone the slogan "You'll own nothing, and you'll be happy".</p>
<p>It's worse than you think.</p>
<p>What those so eager to throw away their right to property fail to understand is that they want more than just your house, your car, your bank account, the clothes on your back. <em>They want you</em>.</p>
<p><em>It follows that if the State owns everything, it takes upon itself ownership of your body - living or dead.</em> It may use you as it sees fit. Young and fit? Off to the forever war with you. Old and worn out? Your date with the "death panel" awaits. Like the bottle a little too much? Like a nice, unhealthy hunk of lasagna or a big steak? Are you really worthy of that triple bypass, comrade?</p>
<p>Now, the State wants the right to perform a medical procedure on you; to inject an unproven, improperly tested vaccine into your veins - regardless of the possible harm it may cause, regardless of your wishes, regardless of your beliefs. </p>
<p>It is the ultimate negation of your rights. It is the ultimate negation of your person. It is the ultimate obscenity.</p>
<p>It must be resisted. It is literally our last stand.</p></p>

        <p>Makes sense why governments have been softening on use of marijuana in various ways. If people can escape reality by getting high, they are more likely to accept all this control.</p>

        <p>Yup.</p>
<p>- In the Middle Ages and Pre-Industrial Revolution society, it was the church.</p>
<p>- In Victorian England, it was gin.</p>
<p>- In Bolshevik Russia, it was cheap vodka.</p>
<p>- Now, one's modern factory-tenement existence will be numbed by weed from the state-sanctioned head shop.</p>

        <p>I think that a lot of people really, really do not understand centralized banking, the federal reserve and how the American economy works as a whole. They will learn, probably sooner rather than later.</p>
