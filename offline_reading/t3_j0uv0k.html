        <p>When we opened after the first lockdown, I went to a strip club w/ my friends and they made us all give our info for contact tracing. Keep in mind this was back in like May though, and we were still kinda like ???? about the virus. </p>
<p>My area didnt even get hit until July, and that is when we locked down again.</p>

        <p>Honestly I'd never encourage people to annoy random employees or service workers, I always treat them with respect, I've worked in similar roles.  There's an issue here though, in that these major companies (and it's usually these large companies who want to keep trading, and are only implementing these policies - and in a way passively supporting those policies, when they're directed from government) are now implementing really invasive requirements.  </p>
<p>Did you ever read about the whole 'sit ins' things in the civil rights movement?  Black people were "obnoxious" and "annoyed" everyday service workers by going in and sitting down in places which insisted blacks were not allowed.  Now, in many cases the owners of these businesses weren't even necessarily racist, but they were implementing policies they thought would be good for their business, based on public demand.  Often the service workers were not to blame either, they were just enforcing what their boss wanted.  Nevertheless, that activism, which caused mild annoyance to some service workers, played a role in turning the social tide against the exclusion of black people from all sorts of stores, restaurants, cafes, pools, etc.</p>
<p>There IS a difference with covid policies, but it IS a genuine violation of what everyone up until this point has known as reasonable terms - that unless a major company has some sort of genuine reason to exclude a customer, such as their having stolen from the store, or harassing other customers, etc - that they have no right to refuse entry.  After all, in most cases these major companies exist in the context they do because of wider social and government forces that affect us all, these huge companies aren't just like a family business which you can avoid if they have a problem with you.  These companies are practically a PART of the government at this point.  </p>
<p>The guy in the video didn't really harass her, he was exposing the fact that she's enforcing ridiculous rules.  Employees of companies should be refusing to implement such stupid policies, corporations like this should also be the focus on public opposition for enforcing such stupid, invasive policies.  The woman is not innocent, she's earning money in that role, that doesn't give her the right to enforce unfair dictates just because "this is a private establishment!" That's bullshit.  There is actually VASTLY less harm done by a single racist small business owner (don't get me wrong, I'm not justifying it, just comparing) than by huge businesses like this refusing lots of people entry without requiring their ID.</p>
<p>Guess what?  As someone with NO REASON TO BELIEVE I HAVE THE VIRUS, nobody has the right to push me around on some sort of 'statistical likelihood' that I do have the virus!  That is a violation.  Most people would be more understanding if this virus was truly truly lethal, something like what we've seen in major 'Pandemic' movies, etc. most people would exercise more reasonable caution.  This virus isn't anything like that, it's literally comparable to the Flu.  If other people are afraid of catching or spreading it, THEY can take precautions, THEY can wear high quality masks, THEY can demand companies provide a special retail hour for them or something.</p>
<p>The guy in the video doesn't sound like he understands the law, he seems like he's fighting an uphill battle and doesn't realise what he's up against, so many see that as foolish, but honestly I see him as a hero, at least in this case.</p>

        <p>&rt; The guy in the video didn't really harass her, he was exposing the fact that she's enforcing ridiculous rules.</p>
<p>He asked her the same question like 4 times that she had already answered, seemingly more times even before the video started rolling. That is harassment, yes.</p>
<p>&rt; Employees of companies should be refusing to implement such stupid policies</p>
<p>Generally when people are making minimum wage they don't have the luxury of quitting their jobs just to make a statement about a specific corporate policy. If they did no one would be working at mcdonalds.</p>
<p>And if every business is implementing these rules, where could they even get a job after anyway? In case you didn't notice unemployment is through the roof right now and quitting your job when you don't know when your next pay cheque will be is a risk not many struggling people can make.</p>
<p>&rt;but honestly I see him as a hero</p>
<p>If wants to be a hero he can try talking to someone who can actually affect policy like a manager or customer service department. It takes 2 seconds to ask for a manager or for a number to the corporate office. I've never directed my criticisms of companies at the people making minimum wage and take all kids of shit and are actually out working when they could have elderly family members at home that its adding unnecessary danger too.</p>
<p>Minimum wage workers right now serious need way more thanking than they get. Instead they are getting this day in day out. I know because I have a family member doing it and she gets treated like shit. Not only do they have to work harder since they are asked to do twice as much like constant cleaning and maintenance, they have to deal with this crap. People arguing about stuff she can't do and acting like she is personally making decisions just to inconvenience them. They are the heroes.</p>

<p>Nothing he did was 'harassment'.  He was firmly asking her questions to get her response on video, to confront her on her enforcing an incredibly violating policy handed down by government diktat!  Even under fascist and communist totalitarian governments people were able to walk into stores without registering their name and number!  You sound like you'd be a massive white-knight in general.  You're basically saying people should never complain, never insist, never disagree vehemently with anyone in customer service ever - that serves the corporate overlords who constantly put up these barriers to opposition to what serves them.</p>
<p>&rt; Generally when people are making minimum wage they don't have the luxury of quitting their jobs just to make a statement </p>
<p>This appears to come from New Zealand, and so I can tell you 100% that woman at the counter could easily get another job if she needed to.  "I'm locking you in a mental assylum against your will based on somebody else reporting you, do not resist I'm just a mere wageslave!" or "I shot your dog after I climbed into the wrong property on a call out, but don't complain I'm a mere wageslave!" do not cut it.  People have the right to go into stores without registering their names or numbers, big stores like this make huge profits because they benefit from social capital in general.  These policies aren't being implemented on a scientific or rational basis, they're literally political policies being implemented by governments because governments are more afraid of the 'scared pandemic believer' voter than the average mentally healthy person.  Corporations like this are implementing and supporting these policies as 'security theatre', to give the IMPRESSION they are making efforts to 'protect customers and staff' so they can keep running and making profits.  Notice that the woman demanding his name isn't wearing a mask and neither is the woman behind her.  If they were truly so concerned wouldn't the company supply each member of staff in a customer-contact role with an N95 mask or something?  It's theatre, and it's HARMFUL theatre because it's at the expense of everyday people's right to live and move about without obstruction from others.</p>
<p>&rt; If wants to be a hero he can try talking to someone who can actually  affect policy like a manager or customer service department. It takes 2  seconds to ask for a manager or for a number to the corporate office. </p>
<p>Companies like this set up complaints and customer service departments to 'manage' these sorts of complaints, to essentially reduce them to nothing.  This man is confronting a paid (well paid in New Zealand, btw) ENFORCER of unjust, violating policies, and sharing the footage for our sake.  Are you one of those guys who obeyed police instructions not to record George Floyd being suffocated?  I mean that poor cop had probably had a tough day already and where else would he work if he left his job?</p>
<p>&rt; Instead they are getting this day in day out. </p>
<p>As they should be.  Interesting that you found the time and energy to respond to my comment defending our basic liberties, when you could have spent that time defending low-wage workers against their bosses by writing messages to them demanding they stop forcing low-wage workers to enforce unfair policies that put them at risk of being "verbally assaulted".</p>

<p>&rt; and so I can tell you 100% that woman at the counter could easily get another job if she needed to.</p>
<p>Ah yes, I'm sure you know her employment situation much better than she does. Funny everyone on this sub seems to assume all these workers can just get better jobs in an instant and are choosing to deal with this shit.</p>
<p>&rt; "I'm locking you in a mental assylum against your will based on somebody else reporting you, do not resist I'm just a mere wageslave!"</p>
<p>Jesus Christ. Yes because this cashier is literally Hitler because she is asking for his phone number so they can send out notice if there is an outbreak.</p>
<p>&rt; People have the right to go into stores without registering their names or numbers</p>
<p>So I guess this guy has never used a credit card or debit card? Because those also include a name and number. Or buy literally anything online which also requires your name, number and way more information like your address, postal code, email address, etc. No I'm sure he has just used cash for every purchase in his life and has never once bought something online.</p>
<p>&rt; Companies like this set up complaints and customer service departments to 'manage' these sorts of complaints, to essentially reduce them to nothing.</p>
<p>If this was the case why would they have them at all? This statement is perhaps the dumbest of them all. I work for large companies implementing these systems and they aren't spending <strong>tens of millions of dollars</strong> on entire departments, CRM systems and employee salaries just to throw out the information they receive. They exist to log complaints in databases that they can then report on and analyze and send the summaries to the people high enough to make the changes. Not only do I work for the teams putting this systems in place now, I started my career in my teens working in one of these call centers.</p>
<p>They do this so that <strong>people aren't wasting cashier's time and holding up lines of people behind them just to argue something the employee doesn't have the tools or time to record and analyze</strong>.</p>
<p>If they weren't designed to do anything it would be an automated voicemail service they never check or maintain. No company pays for dozens of employees and millions worth of software for absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>I'll ask one question, when have these arguments with cashiers being recorded by an angry customer <strong>ever</strong> resulted in them going "oh yeah, I guess you're right. I won't ask you to obey this policy"? Show me examples please.</p>

        <p>&rt;Did you ever read about the whole 'sit ins' things in the civil rights movement?  Black people were "obnoxious" and "annoyed" everyday service workers by going in and sitting down in places which insisted blacks were not allowed.  Now, in many cases the owners of these businesses weren't even necessarily racist, but they were implementing policies they thought would be good for their business, based on public demand.</p>
<p>This is the most important point when considering non-violent opposition to these new  "Jim Crow" laws. Following these discriminatory policies wasn't necessarily good for business. It was the law even for business owners who wanted blacks for customers. </p>
<p>So, likewise in 2020, one can't be sure that a business owner doesn't secretly object to these unconstitutional decrees himself and secretly welcome customers with spines who "sit-in" on his business--even while the business owner feigns agreement with the decrees in order to avoid being shut down by the fully funded police.</p>
