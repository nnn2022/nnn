    <strong>Anti - Lockdowns Protest not working??</strong>
    <p><p>Something just came up in my mind.</p>
<p>There were so many anti-lockdowns protests all over  the world but what has it really changed?, They are still pushing this covid bullshit even when millions of people stood up against this big lie.</p>
<p>If protest don't work how is this ever gonna  stop ?, </p>
<p>Do we all have to put our mask on and start acting like it's a dangerous virus just so you will be respected by society, 
how long are we gonna need to act and fake things and come up with lies and excuses like we believe in it? 
How long do we gotta act like we love to be vaccinated with force for our safety?.
How long do we gotta act like it's good to be isolated and keep everything close?
It's like we suddenly stepped into a new world where everybody is a masked actor.</p>
<p>I wish you all good luck during these horrible times of fakeness, stay strong everyone and I wish y'all the best during these hard times, I hope this will all get over soon without having to take vaccination so we can all live again without having to act fake like we have to believe in this big lie.</p></p>

        <p>Until you manage to convince a majority that your point of view is correct you're likely to be fighting a loosing battle. That may happen over time. Support for a national lockdown in the US is currently over half, but that's down from about three quarters of the population. </p>
<p>That support will likely continue to erode because a lockdown requires compliance to be successful. It only takes a relative small minority to undermine it. So without some very intensive enforcement a lockdown will just drag on, be ineffective, and slowly lose support.</p>

        <p>I'm glad to hear some good news that the support for lockdown is falling in USA, I live in The Netherlands and here it seems like lockdown and vaccination is getting more support, the media and politics in The Netherlands are pushing this vaccination to the next level all they talk about is the vaccine it's all propoganda they are just brainwashing everyone into taking it and I'm afraid it becomes mandatory because protesting here doesn't work either it has no effect at all.</p>

        <p>Support is going to be linked to any success the measures have or seem to have. In reality the key factor is compliance, but to get a high enough percentage of people to comply some government action is required. Australia is getting just a few cases a day. It has more restrictive lockdowns than anything imposed anywhere in the US. Those lockdowns enjoy massive public support, perhaps due to the low rate of infections. </p>
<p>Looking at the number of cases in the Netherlands, they have been able to cut the number of new cases almost in half in the past couple of months. If lockdowns get the credit for it people will accept them being continued.</p>
<p>In the US we have a different story. COVID looks pretty much out of control. There was no unified national response. With no success to show for any local lockdowns support faded.</p>

        <p>I think the protests might help a little but what people need to do is open up their businesses. Removing the masks might take a little longer, given that even anti-lockdown people aren't always anti-mask. Lots of businesses want to reopen but continue wearing masks inside and have customers do the same.</p>

        <p>I wear the mask just to avoid getting in discussion but i had times I could get in the store without a mask without anyone complaining and if I have to wear it I only cover my mouth not my nose so I can still breathe through my nose.</p>

        <p>I have two ideas. </p>
<ol>
<li>Guerilla tactics (I don't mean violence):</li>
</ol>
<p>Decentralize as much as possible and organize to have constant, random, low planning protests and demonstrations popping up all the time. The motto of the Hong Kong protestors was "be like water" and these people, who faced the possibility of 10 years in prison, really new how to protest. </p>
<p>Communication tools are needed to make this work. For a simple solution I tried setting up a wiki for this purpose but I don't think that could ever be accessible enough to gain traction. So instead I'm working on a simple pin drop map website to make it happen. </p>
<p>I think social media is too moderated so we would have to make our own tool or find a sympathetic platform that will work for this purpose. </p>
<ol>
<li>Idea war approach:</li>
</ol>
<p>In the human animal ideas propagate from a small minority of thought leaders and then battle it out as a sort of popularity contest through the rest of the population which are thought followers. Normally, where two ideas conflict people, will weight the idea more favorably based first on its popularity and association with virtue and status (with the opinion of the members of their 'in-group' weighted more highly), and then for practical reasons (i.e. the implications of the idea in real world). It's not all or nothing though, if people can see that a significant minority support an idea then they may identify with that idea if they have strong practical reasons to do so (and also depending on their personality). If many people feel like this then just a few defectors can create an avalanche shift over to the other side because as the popularity of the idea grows it passe a threshold for more and more people to where it is now 'worth-it' to adopt the idea. </p>
<p>Right now, the practical reasons are all on our side and <em>strongly</em> so. While a handful of people are actually emotionally convinced that this virus is a real threat, the extreme effects of the lockdowns are impossible to ignore even despite al of the powerful propaganda techniques and psychological manipulation through the media. So, on that basis we have a chance to start winning the popularity contest, but there are unfortunately a few very severe problems that we need to resolve to make this happen. </p>
<p>Basically, in order to participate in the popularity contest, we need to be able to somehow signal our support for an idea so that people know that we have it. No signal, no popularity contest. </p>
<p>This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are censored online, especially on the most popular social media sites. And if we are not outright censored we are at least, virtually quarantined, so that members of the general public to not come into contact with us directly and at best think of us as foreign members of another "tribe" and can other-ise us. </li>
<li>We are not allowed to congregate or mingle offline (except in grocery stores). </li>
<li>People are actively compelled to adopt the signal of the other side. That is, the mask. As Peter Hitchens once said, it is a form of compelled speech. </li>
</ul>
<p>So to workaround all of this we need to adopt a signal that we can display in the one place that we have left to deliver it, the grocery store (or whatever few public places that we are still allowed to go to). For that, we need a legal, easily obtainable worn symbol. </p>
<p>Why should it be worn? Well vocally supporting the cause or holding up signs fails for practical reasons. Besides that, human beings have a long history of wearing their identity on their clothing, there is something primal about it, and so by wearing a symbol as clothing it will have that primal psychological effect on other people.</p>
