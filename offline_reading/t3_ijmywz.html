    <strong>College Kids Don't Give In to The Fear</strong>
    <p><p>They are threatening to suspend you, close schools, all for doing what human beings are born to do socialize with their peers. Do not give in, this will not "ruin you". Call their bluff, because as tough as these presidents and adminstrators wish to sound, they are just puffer fish. </p>
<p>Threats are all that they have. Do it for freedom, do it for humanity, do it for your future.</p></p>

        <p>It's time to teach the teachers.</p>
<p>Saw an electronic sign by a campus near me 'Face masks must be worn at all times on campus'</p>
<p>Academia loves face diapers, it would be hilarious if it wasn't such a pitiful representation of the level of illiteracy the admins have. </p>
<p>Or is it mind control?</p>

        <p>No doubt in my mind that it is mind control, there is no way that people can be willfully ignorant and stupid to this degree and still function enough. A lot of it is done through the torture and NLP, but there seems to be something else going on with the new frequencies and peoples' smartphone addictions.</p>

        <p>This news story of someone watching facebook videos then storming out to murder someone is mind control in action.

I am all against police brutality, but democracy is suspended right now! How are we supposed to address institutional racism if we don't have access to the institutions of democracy?!?</p>

        <p>Yeah and Sirhan and other manchurian candidate types. That's fucking awful. They want people to believe it is suspended. I was talking about when we forced our way into the capitol last week with a lady. She said "Well it was supposed to be a 'closed session'" Like... are you fucking kidding me? Read the constitution holy shit. These people are insane. </p>
<p>They keep trying to ramrod shit bills behind closed doors, and they are rolling out all the 5G backhaul while telling everyone else to stay at home. Un-fucking-believable. If you agree that legislature should have a "closed-session" you might as well just move the fuck out of america. I'm so tired of the ignorance. /rant</p>
<p>edit: "Just three days before the stabbing, Hatchett had been freed on bond after being charged with criminal damage to property, WLTZ reported. </p>
<p>And he was arrested six months ago for two felonies including aggravated assault. </p>
<p>Judge Hunter declined to issue bond after the latest charges, and ordered a mental health evaluation. "</p>
<p>Hmm, dunno about mind control with this guy... definitely part of it though. A lot of white people are trying to shame me with white guilt and white privelege and shit I am getting tired of it. I'm not a racist, and I'm poor as fuck. My clothes are years/decades old and all my shoes/pants have holes in them. I'm not the fucking enemy here so leave me alone let's fight the real enemy together! I don't want to be proud or ashamed of something I had absolutely no choice in!</p>

        <p>It does include outside spaces, and just in case that wasn't enough self-flagellation you have to sign some kind of pact where you promise not only to don a face diaper, but you take an oath to get a flu shot. https://www.disabledveterans.org/2020/03/11/flu-vaccine-increases-coronavirus-risk/
because it's all about preventing a virus, until it's about actually just donating money to Big Pharma, following undemocratic diktats, and putting yourself in such poor health that the first coronavirus you stick your finger in knocks you out.</p>

        <p>Be smart about it. Go to parties, meet friends and date. Don’t  push it on Instagram or Snapchat. Don’t talk to doomers about your parties. Make sure anyone you invite out will be in the same trouble as you if they rat you out.</p>

        <p>I agree with the spirit of what you're saying.  But unfortunately schools are <a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/plattsburgh-students-community-members-react-to-suspensions-after-weekend-partying/33826024">following through</a> on <a href="https://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/education/2020/08/27/coronavirus-more-marist-students-suspended-champagnat-quarantined/5646105002/">threats</a> to <a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/coronavirus/suny-oneonta-covid-19-1.48754190">close</a> and <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/home/article/Four-UAlbany-students-suspended-as-school-probes-15525735.php">suspend</a>.  The students in Plattsburgh were partying <em>off campus at a beach</em>.  They aren't just being Nazis on the campuses any more, they literally act as though they own your entire life and can punish you for shit you do in your personal time, off premises.  (Not to mention that gatherings of up to 50 are allowed outdoors in NY, and Cuomo has okayed going to the beach, so they weren't even breaking any "rules".  This is akin to a dry campus suspending 21-year-old seniors for drinking at the local bar on a Saturday night)</p>
<p>By all logical measures they shouldn't be able to get away with this authoritarian bullshit, but they are.  If you try to rebel all that's going to happen is you're going to get suspended or thrown out or whatever the fuck other overreactive "punishment" they're handing out for being human.</p>
<p>Honestly if I were a student I'd just take the year off.  Total fucking waste of time, even in the places that are going back all the health theater bullshit and tense atmosphere are going to make for an awful learning environment.</p>

        <p>This is true, my college suspended 11 students for hanging out together without wearing a mask. They also aren't allowed to live on campus anymore and will not be getting their do fees back. Absolutely ridiculous and do many students were cheering about it online 🙄</p>

        <p>I agree. I feel like my four years spent in college was nothing more than an expensive waste of time. I didn't learn the things I expected to learn, the classes were totally pointless and pretty much nothing more than neo-Marxist nonsense, and my peers were all a bunch of dickheads.</p>

        <p>I thought about making a post, but I will just explain what my college is doing here. This is a private university, and we started classes this past Wednesday. The university has decided that they are going to randomly test 300 students every week. It does not matter whether you have symptoms or not. It also does not appear to matter if have classes on campus or not. Refusal to get tested will get you a fine, then suspension or worse if you continue to refuse. </p>
<p>On top of that, we are expected to fill out a symptom survey everyday. They are claiming that this is not mandatory, and there are currently no consequences for failing to fill it out. This may change if infection rates go up. Masks are mandatory on campus. Failure wear a mask will result in a warning first, then fines after. Campus police is enforcing the mask rules. We can also be fined, suspended, or worse for having large gatherings or parties on campus. There was an outbreak of around 10 to 15 cases during on campus freshman orientation, and they blamed that on students getting together for a small party.</p>
<p>This is final semester before graduating. I am avoiding campus all together. We have the option of using zoom or coming into class. I plan on playing their game for the most part bc I just want to be done with school. If they try testing me, I will fight it. I was planning on transfering another school's masters program next year, but I am putting that on hold until the covid shit blows over.</p>

        <p>This is a bait and switch by universities. Test any 300 people at least one or a few will be positive. Then they can say cases are going up, shutting down, and taking $ from students while offering only “zoom” classes and they knew this upfront. </p>
<p>Honestly I’m hoping to see students and parents of students sue over this. Young people are having their lives turned upside down for something that all the data available says is extremely low risk for them.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your motivation, but going to an all liberal college for 4 years I learned the best thing to do was keep my head down and follow the rules. Why? Because  now I can use my education to advance myself and speak up for my beliefs. I wish the world didn't work that way, but I had to maintain a professional and low key profile since I worked with several people on campus.</p>
