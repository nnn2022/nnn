    <strong>When are COVID patients being hospitalized?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a friend who posted that she has a friend who was admitted to the hospital with COVID and "has reached the shortness of breath stage".  If you are not already having shortness of breath, why would you be hospitalized?  Are they just automatically hospitalizing COVID patients now?  Is that the cause for the "rise" in hospitalizations?</p></p>

        <p>No, the "rise" in hospitalizations is fake.</p>
<p>1)  Hospitals always operate at 80-90% capacity.  This is to protect revenue and profitability.  Any lower and they don't meet their revenue numbers.  "fully utilized" != "bad".  It's actually just the opposite.</p>
<p>2) The statistics of COVID hospitaliztions include the numbers of everyone in the hospital that's tested positive using the known-bad high-cycle PCR tests, regardless of what they're in for.  Need surgery?  Test positive?  You're a COVID hospitalization stat.</p>

        <p>To back up your statement, take a look at this Hospital Directors Blog from 2017:</p>
<p><a href="https://hospitalmedicaldirector.com/what-is-the-ideal-hospital-occupancy-rate/">https://hospitalmedicaldirector.com/what-is-the-ideal-hospital-occupancy-rate/</a></p>
<p>For anyone paying attention, notice the tone of the article is "You might assume ideal profit is 100% occupancy" --- get it? From a hospital director's perspective, the assumption is that full occupancy would be most profitable and good.</p>
<p>But then he goes on to explain that something like 75-85% is ideal, with occasional surges to 100% and beyond being <em>normal</em>.</p>
<p>Our media doesn't put any of this into context because their intention is to provoke fear. Remember, the media works for pharmaceutical corporations just like our government does.</p>
<p>What we have here is government-corporate collusion, with shared boardmembers for cross-company profits and kickbacks to politicians for legislation written (in the form of paid speaking engagements and book deals for books which never sell as well as campaign financing, of course.) </p>
<p>Anyhow, another reason for increased hospital numbers is that we had a GLOBAL population boom 80 years ago that lasted 20-25 years... Population growth here jumped from 750,000 a year to over 3 million a year (!)</p>
<p>So we have a growing population of elderly.  What did people expect!?  If we have a "baby boom" then 80 or so years later we're going to have a "death boom." It's just what happens when life expectancy is \~79.</p>
<p>And this will carry on for 20-25 years. The powers that be are taking advantage of this knowledge to scare people.</p>
<p>I don't understand why more people don't talk about the significance of this. It's the primary reason for an increased death count.</p>
<p>I mention it again and again and it never gets traction.</p>

        <p>I work at a kids hospital. We admit kids that are positive and are deemed high risk. An example would be a positive test and severely over weight since it is a risk factor. They are usually showing other symptoms such as a fever or an SpO2 that is trending down. Most cases are admitted over night for observation and discharged within 24 hours that are admitted. A bunch come through the ED, test positive and are sent home.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a BS story.</p>
<p>Does she actually name her friend?  Just ask for some innocent details...</p>
<p>Ask "Why did the hospital admit your friend if they werent even having trouble breathing yet?  I thought they sent mild cases home to recover?"</p>

        <p>Well I just posted on another post that where I am at, the hospitals won’t do anything for you unless you are short of breath. I don’t know about the high risk folks, maybe they are admitted as a precaution but most people, if you go to the hospital and get a positive test they send you home immediately and tell you not to come back unless you are having trouble breathing. A politician, I forget who, busted the “hospitals are overwhelmed with covid patients” crap the other day, he pulled national hospitalization data and it shows that there are plenty of ICU beds and there are more non-covid hospitalizations than covid hospitalizations. Wish I thought to screen shot it.</p>

        <p>They only hospitalize in my area if your blood oxygen dips below 92 UNLESS you have significant other issues. My friends husband was admitted because the only thing COVID did for him was give him leg blood clots. </p>
<p>My partner’s father was admitted today due to his oxygen levels and also passing out twice this morning and falling. His wife who is also with COVID was prescribed a zpac and cough syrup. </p>
<p>FYI they are both fully vaccinated with Pfizer.</p>
