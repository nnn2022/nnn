    <strong>Who is out there?</strong>
    <p><p>I want to connect with others out there in the resistance. I know that I will soon no longer have community left anywhere in my real life, or rights, and I know that it's time to look forward at what's coming next instead of still trying to fix what's been broken.</p>
<p>I'm in a bit of a sticky situation, stuck in a liberal hellhole because that's where my dad lives, and I needed to move back home for a short amount of time while I start working and get ready to make the next move. I managed to get work quickly, and the company hasn't brought a single thing up about COVID, but because of my location I know it's only a matter of time before they're forced to mandate it and it may not be enough time for me to save up and go somewhere else. Obviously I won't disclose my location, but let's just say it's probably the most woke-indoctrinated city in the entire US and full of people/companies who are salivating at the chance to exercise medical authoritarianism over people. My new company genuinely seems cool, but realistically they'll be left with no choice but to mandate it, sooner or later. </p>
<p>I have already decided that I have no desire to live in this society if this is what it's going to come to, if this is the price for participation, but in order to have a fighting chance of making it outside the system I need to work the system and obtain some resources while I can. I thought I had at least a few more months to figure my situation out and obtain some security for myself... who knows how long it will be, but now a few months is seeming far-fetched... I'm kicking myself because I've been living my life like a normal 23-year-old; I graduated college in 2020 and spent the past year living out of the country due to a relationship (I attended a foreign university and met my ex-partner there.) While I was playing house with my ex-partner, who I had to leave and might never see again largely due to everything going on, I know I should have been preparing myself for what the world is coming to but I didn't realize how bad it was going to get. I thought it would be... manageable. It's sad to realize that there's no time for being young or dreaming big anymore, especially not when you're unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Right now, I feel so unsafe and alone. Everyone is talking about how we need to plant our own food, regain our independence, start our own businesses, and I know that is the way but I won't be in a position to do that for quite a while. Or ever, if I'm unable to work due to being unvaccinated. I'm not a complete idiot - I have emergency crypto savings, but still not great prospects for getting set up in a place where I'll be more safe from this impending regime and forced vaccination.</p>
<p>My family is dispersed across the US, none of them are into the propaganda or want the vaccine and that is restricting their mobility, so we're isolated from one another. All of my family are also broke and on hard times so none of us are able to help each other even though we all feel the same thing. I have no car or even a place to call my own since I just landed back into the country, thinking I would have some time to work with and get my shit together. If something big happens soon, I'm fucked. Obviously I'm going to keep a positive attitude and figure out how to get myself somewhere safer, get my independence up and running as soon as possible, but time is of the essence and I'm a bit terrified at how quickly things are moving.</p>
<p>All of that is to say that I'm sure I'm not the only person out there, of any age, that's dealing with this too. Not only are my (our) rights at risk, but the lack of resources and isolation from family, the impending doom of getting sacked for not getting vaccinated, the dystopian nightmare of living in a city where every single face is masked and the city buses have automated messages saying "WELCOME VACCINATED RIDERS", where everyone is liberal and thinks I'm disease-ridden, it's all going to be something to figure out and quite frankly I feel overwhelmed and fucking alone. But I know I'm not alone. So... hello. Maybe you're out there, somewhere nearby. Maybe you need help too. Maybe we can help each other. Maybe you feel overwhelmed and don't know what you're going to do either. Maybe just a little bit of human support and understanding can help us overcome these challenges. Maybe we can have a support group and even physical meet-ups to ensure that all of us who dare to resist this new normal, have a fighting chance, no matter our starting position. Maybe?</p>
<p>Just DM me if any of that appeals to you. Let's link up, get our shit together, and fight our way through this mess of a society before it burns to the ground.</p></p>

        <p>Im here. PM me if you ever need to. At least with the masks I can tell exactly who I wont ever get along with, when I see masked folks in public I immediately think "we have nothing in common" and dont entertain them trying to make friends or make light conversations. I also live in a big city and I am itching to get out before they do dumb shit like QR code grocery store entrance scans (they already got the Aussies to do it, the most brainwashed place on Earth after N Korea).</p>
