    <strong>Wouldn't NOT vaccinating protect more people?</strong>
    <p><p>Hear me out a sec -</p>
<p>According to the "science" you can still get COVID even if you are vaxxed, it just won't be as severe.  And as Fauxci says, you can still infect others with COVID if you are vaxxed, that's why you still have to wear a mask.</p>
<p>So if I get COVID, isn't it better if I get really sick so that I know I have it and I stay home and don't run around spreading the plague?  If I get it and don't feel very ill I would be more likely to not stay home and quarantine myself, right?</p></p>

        <p>Asymptomatic people, while they still can spread a disease, they don’t spread it as much because the symptoms contribute to spread, like coughing, sneezing, and runny nose, are either not present or mitigated.</p>
<p>Even if you have it you’ll spread less if you’re not coughing or sneezing or blowing boogers.</p>
