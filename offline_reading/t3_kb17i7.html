    <strong>Four virus-skeptic leaders were charged, one arrested in Hungary (Europe) overnight</strong>
    <p><p>Four Hungarian corona-skeptic "thought leaders" (with large facebook follower groups) were charged with "the act of spreading misinformation during a pandemic" and "propagating resistance and non-compliance against the corona protection laws" by the police and government.</p>
<p>One was arrested (Godeny), no information yet about the three others.</p>
<p>UPDATE: only one of them was brought in to the police for a few hours, the others only had their computers and phone confiscated. The charges seem to be mostly spreading misinformation about the vaccines (and that deters people from wanting it), but probably also about protesting the restrictions.</p>
<p>Computers and data storage was also confiscated.</p>
<p>To clarify, they were not denying that coronavirus exists, they were denying the effectiveness and usefullness of masking (also on streets), restrictions and mandatory vaccinations, and the media hype and scaremongering.</p>
<p>As a precursor, one of those (Godeny) had a post on his facebook page asking people to prepare and buy a whistle, horn or anything similar that can make a loud noise. Probably this was the last straw in the eyes of the police.</p>
<p>Sorry, but the articles are in Hungarian, google translate might help:<br>

        <p>What's worse is that the opposition parties are also clapping this and applauding all this oppression. They even demand more harsh punishments.</p>
<p>So there is the government (ruling party) and there are the opposition parties, and there is no difference in opinion about measures and masking.</p>

        <p>&rt;So there is the government (ruling party) and there are the opposition parties, and there is no difference in opinion</p>
<p>Hungarian here, there is no opposing party to Fidesz since all of them are bribed by them.</p>
<p>Elections are cheated in a "legal" manner:
 1. Fidesz reps go to poor households or communities (basically 80% of the population) which they have economicly starved. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They offer them basic resources like wood for winter or  potatos and other cheap vegetables. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reps collect votes in exchange for their products. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The EU is well aware of this but they can do absolutely nothing about it. </p>
<p>Also politicians (not just Fidesz, literally every party) regularly collect money that is coming from the EU and spend it on luxuries. </p>
<p>And our PM lives in a castle. </p>
<p>&rt;About covid</p>
<p>Most of the population receives their information through TV, which means that the goverment can say anything and ~70% will believe it. </p>
<p>Since the population is mostly of old age and the Propaganda machine is at full throttle the general  consensus says that we will all die by next summer. </p>
<p>And you can get fined up to 200.000 HUF or even jailed for not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>TL;DR:  Hungary is fucked, and has been for the last 2 decades.</p>
