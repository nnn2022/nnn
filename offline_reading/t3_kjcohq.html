        <p>Well, we know they don’t work. But that isn’t my issue. </p>
<p>Even if they did work, it should be your individual choice to go out there with no mask and risk catching ‘covid’ or whatever else is out there in the world. </p>
<p>So yeah, a complete infringement on the individual. I don’t care about 200,000 Americans dead.</p>

        <p>And the counterargument to that is that you wear the mask to protect <em>others</em>. </p>
<p>My problem with that argument is that it isn’t my duty to protect others, no matter how “simple” the ask is. </p>
<p>The burden of protecting oneself, when one is so vulnerable, is a personal issue—it shouldn’t make for a burden on the collective.</p>
<p>Edit: The governments of France and the Netherlands had no problem telling women that they <em>weren’t allowed</em> to publicly cover their faces during the burka bans...pre-CoVid, of course.</p>

        <p>Great point. At what point was I supposed to care so much about my neighbor that I have to stop living my life?</p>
<p>Let me be clear - it isn’t MURDER to go out and socialize. If 65 y/o former alcoholic and smoker Jim gets covid (from me) and dies, is it my fault or his? At the end of the day, we’re responsible for OUR OWN health. Since when was that suddenly not the case?</p>

        <p>Exactly. I’ve been accused of wanting to commit genocide against the elderly...which hardly warrants a response. However, I feel obliged to respond that, in my experience (which includes quite a bit of elder care, in an institutional setting), seniors are the first to flout mask guidelines, due to a strong sense of personal liberty.</p>
<p>I guess that idea has gone out the window. Kids these days have spent their entire lives in front of a screen. Being brainwashed by Marxist, Chinese and Russian propaganda—movies, YouTube, social media. Easy ways to influence American youths...</p>

        <p>Yep, and it’s very sad. </p>
<p>I do love seeing older folks laugh about these mandates. It really just seems to invalidate all of the doomer’s concerns. </p>
<p>I guess the light at the end of the tunnel is that the Reddit echo chambers don’t reflect reality. I go to work and none of my co workers wear masks around each other. Hardly any masks outdoors when highly unnecessary. Lots of folks who say they won’t be taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>Then you see various YouTube channels that support the notion of we shouldn’t be taking these measures - millions of viewers, plenty of engagement and overwhelming numbers of people who agree that ‘something fishy’ is happening at large. </p>
<p>Reddit sure does piss me off, as does Twitter and certain parts of the internet, but there are a lot of eyes that see through and understand the extent of these measures.</p>

        <p>As have I. The same thing will continue to happen, and only at an increased rate, if we continue to fund these machines. </p>
<p>No google (or google services), no iPhone, definitely none of the big social media platforms, no fucking Tik tok. </p>
<p>There needs to be a massive push towards new, open discussion platforms, and ones that prioritize privacy. Censorship is obviously a problem, but I’m far more concerned about what will happen if/when there’s a full blown instilled police state. You know they’ll be able to find you. You know they listen to what you say. </p>
<p>And your neighbor is willing to take a video of you with no mask on and upload it wherever? This is actually 1984.</p>

        <p>I watched “Snowden” last week. I was vaguely familiar with the situation, but I had no idea just how bad the surveillance of every single average citizen was.</p>
<p>I’m waiting on the nanny/police state to be fully-implemented. Seems to be gradually headed in that direction.</p>
<p>I recently read comments on Reddit in which a transgender person suggested that they were looking forward to the day (in the foreseeable future) when they could have <em>their own mother</em> arrested and charged with “transphobic verbal assault.”</p>
<p>Another person was asking about their SO “not taking his coronavirus seriously enough.” Despite the fact that they were separated within their own home, and being very cautious...someone in the comments recommended that they call their spouse’s employer and rat them out for “not properly following guidelines” AT HOME.</p>
<p>That’s some McCarthyism/1984 nonsense...call the thought police on your family and friends. It’s “cancel culture” on steroids...</p>

        <p>Exactly. It’s frustrating how unintelligent most people are. </p>
<p>But god forbid you use to any capacity critical thinking, you’re a conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>No doubt, the men at the top have been very systematic in their approach. This is psychological.</p>

        <p>Psyops on the grandest scale.</p>
<p>It’s really just taking advantage of the bell-curve which you (indirectly) referenced. The tips of the curve are negligible if you’re controlling the center, the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>And these things can be tested before they’re rolled out. It’s not so much a conspiracy as it is common sense. </p>
<p>If an entity wants some outcome and has practically unlimited resources to achieve those ends, then what’s stopping it?</p>
