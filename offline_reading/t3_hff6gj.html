    <strong>MA is announcing school reopening plans tomorrow and I'm really scared</strong>
    <p><p>I guess I could settle with every other day for just the fall, but I'm worried they'll cancel sports, or have class sizes in the single digits. The bare minimum I'm asking for is for fall to be at least 50% in person and classes to be at least 15 people, and no cancelling sports. This is my senior year I'm so scared the gov will fuck this up and be the first state to say they'll go online in the fall</p></p>

        <p>Feel for ya dude. The deaths we've seen from the virus have been terrible no doubt, but I swear what made me the saddest was how class of 2020 was completely robbed of their moment. I work in education and care a lot about kids I work with. This whole situation is fucked.</p>

        <p>God I hate being class of 2020 . I feel sorta selfish but god damn I feel jealous that potentially all other classes will get what was denied from me because of a virus that can not kill me . I just wanted to have a prom and have a fun graduation with my friends but in the blink of an eye it was yanked . This was supposed to be THE YEAR I was waiting 3 years for this . They gave us some “online graduation “ and I honestly fuckung hated it and can’t get myself to watch it because it Just reminds me of what has become of my class. At the same time we where denied our graduation all the BLM protests where happening and it was crazy  seeing my school come out In support of protesting but not graduation. I was never a good student but damn do i feel for my classmates who worked their asses off they must have been devastated . </p>
<p>Ik its proabaly minor given that many people are suffering in worse ways because of lockdowns but damn this really sucked . I mean bright side class of 2020 will be remembered as a very unique class at least . I pray that OP can have a good year himself along with class of 2021</p>

        <p>I graduated from college this spring (Associates in Software Development) and I know my moment got robbed from me, no walking the stage or anything for spring semester graduates, what made matters worse is that they made the decision 2 months in advance and used the insulting "this was a hard decision" and "because of COVID-19" language in their statement and also did not bother to restore cancelled events when the lock-down orders were taken down (live in WI, so the orders were taken down entirely) and are still doing the "partial reopen" garbage as if we are still under mandate.</p>
<p>I felt myself die inside and also a really deep resentment when I learned about the cancellation of graduation, not going to lie. But part of me is glad I graduated when I did with this garbage going on."</p>
<p>And I also feel terrible for the high school graduates of 2020, I remember my high school graduation fondly and feel sad the Class of 2020 has been royally fucked out of it.</p>

<p>Stealth austerity, they pulled that shit with PR language so they wont feel bad about it. They're hoping that you wont demand a real graduation, and if you did they will just trash the letter.</p>
<p>These same idiots that failed you will berate you to vote "now more than ever"</p>

        <p>You can’t be happy when they take 100 dollars from you and give you back 50 a few months later. Organize protests with like minded students at your school. That’s what I’m gonna do when fall semester starts. Demand that the staff listen to the students. We are the people, we have the power.</p>

        <p>Our state health department is warning schools right now of the sEcOnD wAvE because cases are on a little uptick on college towns and metro areas. Those of us in a county with 5 cases (all mild and recovered) since mid March are like “stfu and stop trying to California our Kansas.”</p>

        <p>I agree these aren’t quite so bad but my question from day 1 has been “how do they plan to enforce masks?” You’ll have defiant teenagers and young kids that will take them off or fiddle with them constantly. Is this as punishable as talking back? They have to realize there will be a percentage or parents that won’t back that policy. Sure, punish my kid if he bullies the new kid but punish him because he took his mask off because they suck wearing??</p>
