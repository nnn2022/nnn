        <p>Covid isn’t caused by a virus. That’s a fact. Scientists have utterly failed to prove that it is. So what is causing it? I don’t care what any brainwashed individual says, I believe that it is 5G. </p>
<p>It’s a proven fact, that electricity in many different forms, can negatively impact your health. People are ignorant to the fact that we are electrical beings. Everything that happens in our bodies, is electrical...even our thoughts. </p>
<p>We generate our own electromagnetic fields with our hearts. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen <a href="https://kirlianresearch.com/kirlian-effect/">Kirlian photography </a> photography, but it’s a trip. There’s a reason that <a href="https://hatch.kookscience.com/wiki/Dicyanin_(synthetic_dye)">Dicyanin</a> synthetic dye is illegal. It’s because they don’t want people to be able to see this kind of stuff. </p>
<p>This book, can tell you all about it:

        <p>Yeah, I checked it out. It's the Active Denial System. I’m sure that you’ve seen the vehicles that are equipped with them. With the smart grid, theoretically they could blanket an entire city with 95GHz. Someone could  have a whole city of very obedient slaves in no time with that....or, they could make it 60GHz, and steal everyone’s oxygen. </p>
<p>Side note.....I’ve seen, and heard drones flying at night.....but only on cloudy/foggy nights. Big ones, and quite a few of them. One was watching me the other night. It was creepy af. </p>
<p>I’d get the fuck out of the city if you’re in one.</p>

        <p>I was thinking it's an effective disbursement or " herding" tech. You could actively corral people with <em>pain</em>. As far as drones I live in a fairly rural area, I drive a good bit for my job my wife and everyone thinks I'm crazy but abouit 39 mins before sunset not too long a black drone/ small aircraft flew over my vehicle, and then went vertical and disappeared. There were other people on the highway too I just haven't been able to corroborate with any of them</p>
