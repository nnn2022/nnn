    <strong>A ridiculous plan to stop all this nonsense.</strong>
    <p><p>Before I post this fellow redditors do realize I'm not at all serious about this but hey maskers out there what do you think?</p>
<p>I hereby propose that the federal government give the entire country one week to prepare for a 100% total lockdown.  This means nobody leave your house for three weeks.</p>
<p>Go get your food, if you can, to last for 3 weeks.  Water and power companies by federal mandate will not charge or cut off service for the entirety of that time.  Rent and mortgage payments are suspended across the boards for one month.  </p>
<p>Essential people are allowed to travel one person per vehicle to work if necessary and are required to be in full MOPPS gear throughout the day. </p>
<p>At the end of the three weeks medical teams again in full MOPPS gear will go house to house to check you for symptoms.  If everyone in the house is not feverish and passes an on site test they are given a badge that notes as such and are free to return to work or school.  Badges must be worn clearly visible on the upper left part of the torso.  A single mask is still mandated for 2 weeks.  After they it is personal choice if you wear one or not.  Masks will no longer be mandated or required as a condition of employment.</p>
<p>Any person that shows symptoms the house is quarinted and put under guard.  Food items will be delivered until all parties in the house or apartment are cleared by a medical professional.</p>
<p>Severe cases are to be reported and medical personnel will be dispatched to transport the victim and their families to local quarantine centers until all parties recover and are tested clear.  </p>
<p>There you go maskers.  Yall can eventually all be safe and happy it only takes an impossible situation to make it happen.  </p>
<p>I figure about six weeks whoever is going to be dead from this will be in that situation and the rest of us can go about our lives without wearing a silly piece of cloth over our faces because now you're 'safe' from a .01% cause of death virus.</p>
<p>Feel better now? Idiots.</p></p>

        <p>The fact that grocery stores were never closed showed me that this was a calculated effort to control people as much as possible without crossing the line where theyd revolt. Herbert Hoover figured out how to feed the world by mail in 1920. It is simple with powdered milk and eggs and canned meats and vegetables and rice. The gov is prepared for this. They think our only desires are to eat and shit, and that is why grocery stores and target get to stay open.</p>
