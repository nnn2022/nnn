    <p><p><strong>Open Letter to the authorities in charge of</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pandemic management</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Imagine a society where the judicial system is based on the principle</p>
<p>" Everyone is guilty until proven otherwise ." Which are</p>
<p>the logical consequences of acting under this principle? Well, that</p>
<p>all members of that society must remain under a form</p>
<p>of police custody - such as house arrest or in a detention center</p>
<p>detention - or with a measure that restricts your movements such as</p>
<p>shackles or handcuffs, because they can "escape".</p>
<p>Would you consider that principle - and by extension that society -</p>
<p>as logical and fair? I hope your answer is no, because our</p>
<p>civilization has always been ruled  under the right</p>
<p>to presumption to innocence: “ all are innocent, until proven otherwise ”.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, the management of the pandemic in XXXX has operated</p>
<p>much like the first scenario: “ everyone is sick until they proven otherwise ”and under this premise it has been justified policies curfews, close bars, fined for not wearing a mask, being arrested for having "clandestine parties", and so on.</p>
<p>This position was recently defended by Anthony Fauci <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dfatmz8KnMDI">(see</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dfatmz8KnMDI">video here), </a>director of the US CDC, when Ohio Senator Jim</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Jordan asked him “</p>
<p>-What objective or numerical goal or verifiable standard should we achieve in public health so that Americans have their freedoms back? "</p>
<p>- Fauci replied: You see it as a suppression of freedom, I see it as a public health prevention measure to prevent the people die and hospitals collapse […] at this time we are at too high levels.</p>
<p>Fauci never answered the question and never gave a goal quantifiable to say " Ok, we can go back to how things were before 2020 ”. The same question may be asked: do we have a goal quantifiable in number to deaths or hospitalizations that tells us</p>
<p>XXXXians “we can have a life like before March of 2020? ”. Or is it that perhaps the goal is the utopian and unattainable “0 cases of covid-19 ”? Yes, I say it is utopian because being very similar to the flu in as for the mode of infection and evolution, it will not go away and it is a disease</p>
<p>with which we are going to have to live as we have with the</p>
<p>tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, cholera, hepatitis, etc.</p>
<p>Let me now argue why the measures taken to</p>
<p>curbing coronavirus infections are more harmful than beneficial.</p>
<p>In a meta-study published by Vainshelboim (2021) 1 , both</p>
<p>the ineffectiveness of masks as well as the negative effects of</p>
<p>confinements in health. Below I detail the main points</p>
<p>in that meta-study, without first fervently encouraging you, to read in its entirety (12 pages not counting the references).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• As of October 1, 2020, 34,166,633 cases were reported worldwide</p>
<p>and 1,018,876 have died with a virus diagnosis. Interestingly, 99%</p>
<p>of the cases detected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have a</p>
<p>mild condition, which contradicts the name of the virus (respiratory syndrome</p>
<p>severe acute coronavirus-2).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Given that asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases, there are several</p>
<p>times greater than the number of reported cases, the mortality rate is</p>
<p>considerably less than 1%.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• […] However, it is not clear what is the scientific and clinical basis for the</p>
<p>use of masks as a protective strategy, since masks</p>
<p>[…] Restrict breathing, causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia and</p>
<p>increase the risk of respiratory complications, self-contamination and</p>
<p>exacerbation of existing chronic conditions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Hypothesis:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The practice of wearing masks have a safety and efficacy profile</p>
<p>committed.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Both medical and non-medical masks are ineffective for</p>
<p>reduce person-to-person transmission and infectivity of SARS-</p>
<p>CoV-2 and COVID-19,</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The use of masks has physiological effects and psychological effects,</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The long-term consequences of the use of masks on health are</p>
<p>harmful.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• On the other hand, mild or moderate chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia, such as the use of masks, results in a shift towards a greater contribution</p>
<p>anaerobic energy metabolism, decreased pH levels</p>
<p>and increased blood cell acidity, as well as toxicity, stress</p>
<p>oxidative, chronic inflammation, immunosuppression and deterioration of health.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• In addition, the efficiency of the filtration rate of the masks is</p>
<p>very poor, ranging from 0.7% in the non-surgical woven mask</p>
<p>With cotton gauze and 26% in the fabric cotton material. With</p>
<p>Compared to N95 medical and surgical masks, the filtration rate</p>
<p>efficiency is between 15% and 58%, respectively, when there is</p>
<p>even a small gap between the mask and the face.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• […] Among asymptomatic individuals, no drops or aerosols were detected</p>
<p>of coronavirus in any participant with or without a mask, which suggests</p>
<p>that asymptomatic individuals do not transmit or infect others</p>
<p>people</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• A recent systematic review of 39 studies with 33,867 participants</p>
<p>in community settings (self-reported disease), they did not find</p>
<p>differences between N95 respirators versus surgical masks and</p>
<p>surgical mask versus no mask in risk of developing</p>
<p>influenza or influenza-like illness, suggesting its ineffectiveness</p>
<p>to block viral transmissions in community settings,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Although the overall findings showed a reduced risk of transmission of the virus with masks, the analysis had severe limitations</p>
<p>to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• [...] The results of the meta-analysis were based on a single study of</p>
<p>COVID-19, one from MERS and 8 from SARS, which caused a high bias of</p>
<p>selection of studies and contamination of results between</p>
<p>different viruses Based on four COVID-19 studies, the meta-analysis</p>
<p>could not demonstrate the risk reduction of face masks for</p>
<p>transmission of COVID-19, where the authors reported that</p>
<p>meta-analysis results have low certainty and are not conclusive,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) made</p>
<p>similar recommendations, indicating that only symptomatic people</p>
<p>should consider the use of a mask, while for people</p>
<p>asymptomatic, this practice is not recommended.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• […] the potential harms and risks of wearing masks were clearly</p>
<p>admitted. These include self-contamination due to constant</p>
<p>touching or because it is not replaced when the</p>
<p>mask is wet, dirty or damaged, the development of lesions</p>
<p>facial skin, irritant dermatitis or acne and psychological distress</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Trapped air between the mouth, nose, and mask is breathed out</p>
<p>repeatedly in and out of the body, containing low levels of O 2</p>
<p>and high CO 2 concentrations , causing hypoxemia and hypercapnia.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Low oxygen content in arterial blood can cause ischemia</p>
<p>myocardial, severe arrhythmias, right or left ventricular dysfunction,</p>
<p>dizziness, hypotension, syncope and chronic pulmonary hypertension of low</p>
<p>grade.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Hypoxemia and hypercapnia as a result of mask use</p>
<p>can cause exacerbation of cardiopulmonary diseases,</p>
<p>metabolic, vascular and neurological conditions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Breathing polluted air with high particulate content</p>
<p>bacterial and toxic concentrations along with low levels of O 2 and</p>
<p>high levels of CO 2 continually challenge the body's homeostasis,</p>
<p>causing autotoxicity and immunosuppression.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• A chronic state of hypoxia and mild hypercapnia has been shown to</p>
<p>main mechanism for developing cognitive dysfunction based on</p>
<p>animal studies and studies in patients with lung disease</p>
<p>chronic obstructive.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Another study in 158 health workers, who used equipment</p>
<p>protection, mainly N95 masks, reported that the</p>
<p>81% (128 workers) developed new headaches during their</p>
<p>work shifts, as these become mandatory due to the outbreak of</p>
<p>COVID-19.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• […] However, a large damaging effect was observed with a risk of more than</p>
<p>13 times higher [Relative risk = 13.25; 95% CI (1.74 to 100.97)] for</p>
<p>flu-like illnesses among those who wore face masks</p>
<p>of cloth. The study concluded that cloth masks have important</p>
<p>health and safety concerns, including moisture retention,</p>
<p>reuse, poor filtration and increased risk of infection, so</p>
<p>It is recommended against the use of cloth masks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Bad social connections are closely related to the</p>
<p>isolation and loneliness, considered important risk factors</p>
<p>related to health. [...] Another meta-analysis of 148 studies</p>
<p>prospective (308,849 participants) found that bad relationships</p>
<p>social conditions were associated with a 50% higher risk of mortality.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• [...] An overview of 40 systematic investigations including</p>
<p>10 meta-analysis, showed that compromised social relationships are</p>
<p>associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality,</p>
<p>depression, anxiety, suicide, cancer, and physical illnesses in general.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Meeting people who wear masks activates innate emotion</p>
<p>stress-fear, which is fundamental for all human beings in</p>
<p>dangerous or life-threatening situations, such as death or a</p>
<p>unknown and unpredictable outcome.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>• Prolonged hypoxic-hypercapnic state compromises balance</p>
<p>normal physiological and psychological, deteriorates health and promotes</p>
<p>development and progression of existing chronic diseases.</p>
<p>A. Objects and masks before touching. B. Objects and masks after</p>
<p>touching contaminated with bacteria. C. Face contaminated with bacteria</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As you can see there is a lot of evidence that does not justify the measures that</p>
<p>are being taken to contain the coronavirus pandemic in the country.</p>
<p>Based on the above, you could assert that the masks are</p>
<p>exacerbating contagions, since they are being used in environments so</p>
<p>diverse and not very sterile, in addition to not being continuously washed.</p>
<p>What consequences does this have? That the bacterial load accumulates</p>
<p>inside the mask and the risk of tuberculosis or another respiratory infection that can very easily be</p>
<p>“Listed” as covid-19 (especially with the high rate of false</p>
<p>positive from PCR tests). It is important to emphasize that infections</p>
<p>—Especially respiratory— are not caused by a single organism,</p>
<p>rather they are a synergy of organisms.</p>
<p>In addition, it does not justify the use of the mask in open environments,</p>
<p>due to Stokes' law for particles suspended in a medium. In order to</p>
<p>understand what Stokes' law is, imagine a you throw a</p>
<p>bowling ball and a 1-cm diameter flex foam ball from a building,</p>
<p>Now ask yourself which particle will reach the ground faster, if the air</p>
<p>It does not move? Obviously the bowling ball, because it's bigger</p>
<p>and dense. But if the particle is very small, like an aerosol, it will</p>
<p>remain suspended in the air, its falling speed can last for hours,</p>
<p>like when you see dust suspended in a beam of sunlight that filters through</p>
<p>in a window.</p>
<p>This is relevant, because it implies that the visible drops - the only ones</p>
<p>that do block the masks - they fall directly to the ground and the main</p>
<p>transmission mechanism of the coronavirus (or any virus in</p>
<p>general) is by aerosols. But Stokes Law works only in media</p>
<p>that do not move and the outside environment is constantly in</p>
<p>movement. Where perhaps we should pay attention is indoors,</p>
<p>since the air is relatively static. By understanding Stokes Law,</p>
<p>then what should be done is to improve the ventilation of buildings</p>
<p>as far as possible, either by opening the windows or by installing</p>
<p>air circulation mechanisms.</p>
<p>What I mention is not new, because the safety technicians and</p>
<p>Industrial Occupational Hygiene professionals 2 , already applied this to mitigate hazards in the</p>
<p>workplace and follow what they call a “hierarchy of control measures". The technician first asks: Can I replace or eliminate the</p>
<p>danger? In the case of covid-19 this is not possible. Second: Implement</p>
<p>engineered solutions that dilute, destroy, or contain the hazard. On</p>
<p>in the case of covid-19 this applies with the improvement of ventilation</p>
<p>to dilute the suspended viral load in aerosols. Third: controls</p>
<p>administrative: can I rotate staff or decrease the time spent</p>
<p>in the area where I know you cannot implement engineering control?</p>
<p>This point confirms what I said earlier: people should be outside, not</p>
<p>indoors where the viral load is most likely to accumulate</p>
<p>aerosols, even more if there is no ventilation. So it makes no sense to</p>
<p>close beaches, parks, fields, sports centers.</p>
<p>And finally, if none of the above measures is possible, you must</p>
<p>use some form of personal protection, only as a last resort and under a</p>
<p>monitoring that verifies that the person is capable of supporting that personal protection equipment (PPE). This is because PPE is annoying and</p>
<p>prolonged use may cause more damage than it is intended to avoid. This is the case with masks. And yet this well known protocol by occupational safety technicians  has been ignored</p>
<p>and you have prioritized the use of PEE. Everything backwards. I put my pants on first and then underpants. I recommend to <a href="https://rumble.com/vfcyoh-sub-es-kristen-meghan-y-tammy-clark-testifican-para-que-se-elimine-obligato.html">watch</a> this testimony of 2 technicians in industrial safety in the North Dakota government, where they detail this and much more.</p>
<p>But there is something else about viruses in the open environment: and it is</p>
<p>that UV rays from the sun inactivate viral particles. Shanna</p>
<p>Ratnesar-Shumate (2020) 3 et. to the. were based on the fact that ultraviolet light, is easily absorbed by certain nucleic acid bases</p>
<p>in DNA and RNA, which can cause them to bind to viruses.</p>
<p>Specifically this study tested the effects of ultraviolet light on</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 in simulated saliva. They observed that the virus was inactivated</p>
<p>when exposed to simulated sunlight for 10 to 20 minutes. This</p>
<p>study found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was three times more sensitive to</p>
<p>UV rays from sunlight than influenza A, and 90% of the particles</p>
<p>of the coronavirus were inactivated after only half an hour of exposure</p>
<p>in the noon sunlight in summer.</p>
<p>Another point that goes hand in hand with masks is the issue of</p>
<p>curfews or lockdowns. Do they really work? According</p>
<p>with Bjørnskov (2021) 4 and Bendavid et. at (2021) 5 the answer is no. In the</p>
<p>first study, Bjørnskov (2021) 4 created two indexes where he compares the</p>
<p>weekly death rates of 24 European countries with policies</p>
<p>taken (transformed to a number depending on the degree of severity</p>
<p>of the confinement and the time that the confinement lasted). Found no correlation</p>
<p>between the severity of the confinements and a possible decrease in the rates</p>
<p>mortality rate for which he concludes that “[the confinements] have not worked</p>
<p>as desired […] and they are long-term government failures ”.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Regarding the second study by Bendavid et. to (2021) 5 , they compared</p>
<p>8 countries with very restrictive measures and 2 that took measures</p>
<p>mild restrictive (Sweden and South Korea) with the growth rate of</p>
<p>covid-19 cases. Once the data have been adjusted for the differences in each</p>
<p>country, they did not find “ any clear and significant beneficial effect of the</p>
<p>more restrictive measures on the growth of cases in any country.</p>
<p>[…] Although small benefits cannot be excluded, we did not find</p>
<p>significant benefits in the growth of cases of measures more</p>
<p>restrictive. Similar reductions in the growth of</p>
<p>cases with less restrictive interventions. […] In other words, the</p>
<p>orders to stay at home may make it easier to</p>
<p>transmission if they increase person-to-person contact where the</p>
<p>transmission is more efficient, like closed spaces. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The paper by Bendavid et. to the. (2021) 5 admits possible limitations in</p>
<p>your study, which you yourself may be thinking as: it is not the same to</p>
<p>compare a country with a temperate climate with a tropical one like ours,</p>
<p>in addition to culture and other factors that make comparison more difficult.</p>
<p>However, if there were a benefit of confinements, this would be</p>
<p>marginal and would not justify the economic or psychological damage.</p>
<p>And as stated in the study by Vainshelboim (2021) 1 , psychological  stress</p>
<p>also plays an important role and I would dare to say that</p>
<p>in conjunction with masks, it has contributed greatly to the</p>
<p>increase in the number of hospitalizations. The direct impacts of fear</p>
<p>and psychological stress in the immunovulnerable elderly, certainly</p>
<p>have been underestimated, which is why it is the age group most affected by the pandemic. Psychological stress has been shown to be a factor that can</p>
<p>significantly depress the immune system and induce</p>
<p>diseases, including: immune response dysfunction,</p>
<p>depression, cardiovascular disease and cancer 6 .</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been established since 1991 that psychological stress - such as not knowing where to get the money to eat tomorrow or pay</p>
<p>taxes regardless of whether or not there has been a profit—</p>
<p>dramatically increases susceptibility to diseases and</p>
<p>viral respiratory infections, even in healthy young people 7 and to this we add the social isolation 8 caused by the closure of schools, bars and even the</p>
<p>impossibility of family reunions, creating the perfect recipe for</p>
<p>making people more susceptible to respiratory infections.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If the coronavirus is so dangerous, why even in</p>
<p>bureaucratic establishments and health centers, there are no</p>
<p>biosafety protocols to properly dispose of</p>
<p>masks? I have seen masks thrown on the floor on more than one occasion</p>
<p>and open-air garbage cans overflowing with them. Although perhaps</p>
<p>I only had the misfortune to run into anecdotal cases.</p>
<p>To conclude, I just make a reflection. A society in which</p>
<p>citizens are more afraid of the police than the thief, it is a society under a police state at the best style of</p>
<p>"1984" by George Orwell. I have seen very painful cases <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://m.facebook.com/story.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D785611405668467%26id%3D100026588433506">like this one</a></p>
<p><a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://m.facebook.com/story.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D785611405668467%26id%3D100026588433506">video</a>, where a woman from the capital films two police officers justify themselves that they cannot do nothing, because the thief didn't stab her . But if she or anyone would have been without a mask or in a soccer field outside, the city police suddenly have the courage to stop or</p>
<p>fine those citizens (I am aware that city police and national police</p>
<p>have different functions). Does the "new normal"</p>
<p>involves "normalizing" things like what <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mfk13l/spain_woman_being_abused_by_policemen_for_not/%3Futm_source%3Dshare%26utm_medium%3Dios_app%26utm_name%3Diossmf">happened in this video</a>, where a</p>
<p>cop in Spain brutally beat a person who “violated the</p>
<p>quarantine"?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do not in any way think that I am strange to the call of doctors who</p>
<p>face the pandemic on the front line or people who are waiting</p>
<p>of an ICU bed. Rather, I want to offer a perspective that</p>
<p>perhaps it has been overlooked and that might help. More than a year has passed since all kinds of civil liberties began to be restricted</p>
<p>and apparently everything remains the same. For some reason that I cannot</p>
<p>understand, Farr's epidemiological law has not been resumed and the “cases” keep being constant instead of decreasing. I think the measures of</p>
<p>confinement are what have caused this artificiality of deaths</p>
<p>surpluses and therefore should no longer be implemented.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines are not hope either, because as it has</p>
<p>said Anthony Fauci - director of the US CDC -, even after</p>
<p>vaccinated, you should continue using the mask, you should continue with the</p>
<p>distancing, curfews should be made, because vaccines</p>
<p>only decrease symptoms <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dzz7aYhAXP9M">see video in english here</a> and <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dff-PJp1f5v4">here</a>). As</p>
<p>alternative, why not not promote the prudent intake of vitamin C and D in</p>
<p>the population by way of prevention, since it has been shown that</p>
<p>it strengthens the immune system and reduces the risk of dying with covid-</p>
<p>19, as well as it can reduce the physiological consequences of those who have</p>
<p>infected 9 10 11 ■</p>
