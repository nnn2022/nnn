    <strong>Politicians suddenly benevolent?</strong>
    <p><p>This is the aspect of the brainwashing assault that's surprised me most. I've known for years that terrified people are easy to manipulate, but many of us seemed to have a common understanding before that politicians only cared about themselves. We laughed about how they'd say anything to get elected and agreed that up in their ivory towers, they couldn't care less.</p>
<p>Then, in 2020, those same politicians shut down the economy and people said it's to save lives. That it was in our best interest. As if these sociopaths actually grew a soul.</p></p>

<p>Well- they may well have ordered the seeds for souls from some GMO company but they planted the seeds in asphalt and hard cement so they needed to fake a harvest.</p>
<p>They'll do it all again during the next election cycle.</p>
