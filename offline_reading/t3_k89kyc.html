        <p>I never took it but earlier on in the pandemic my dad came home from work sick and had to stay home for a couple of weeks(he was grumpy but fine).</p>
<p>My mom seemed to get a little sick from him even though she did not sleep with him, Well anyone who has horses knows that ivermectin is a common staple for a horse medicine cabinet lol.</p>
<p>She took some ivermectin because she had a sore throat and was coughing and it made her feel better she said took like 2 days to kick in. I am very young and did not feel any symptoms so I did not take it.</p>
<p>It's a horse dewormer, now I am not telling you all to go buy that I know your not the type to worry about this anyway. Im just sharing my experience on it and what my mother did.</p>
