        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; The answers were given by Martin Blaser, director of Rutgers’ Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine and a professor of medicine and microbiology, and published as a discussion piece on the university’s Rutgers Today news site.</p>
<p>&rt; According to Blaser, the virus is spreading so rapidly because “people are behaving badly,” and New Jersey residents are expecting “too much, too soon” in terms of a reopening, which he said requires a “graded approach.”</p>
<p>&rt; “As long as the virus is circulating, we will not have ‘normal’ life,” Blaser wrote. “Instead, there will be a ‘new normal,' which is continuing to evolve day by day.</p>
<p>&rt; “We can’t stay home forever, but we can be much smarter than we were just a few months ago. This involves keeping our distances, avoiding crowded indoor spaces, wearing masks, washing your hands when you touch objects in public and isolating when ill.”</p>
<p>&rt; Looking to the months ahead, Blaser predicts “a rather small flu year” in the fall to compound the pandemic, which he believes will continue due to the fact that a vaccine is not expected until 2020 “at the very earliest.</p>
<p>&rt; “There are only three important factors that will help decrease the infection rate and get our lives back to how they were before the coronavirus pandemic: developing a vaccine, therapies to markedly reduce the fatality rate, and social distancing and wearing a mask,” Blaser wrote. “There will be risk, at all ages, until we have the vaccine and/or better medical therapies.”</p>

<p>"Herd immunity," what's that? "Sweden?" Huh? Isn't that the girl who played little Stephanie Tanner?</p>
<p>&rt;“There will be risk, at all ages, until we have the vaccine and/or better medical therapies.”</p>
<p>"This virus doesn't discriminate. Pay no attention to the statistics that show that the vast majority of deaths are among the elderly, and that there are almost none among children and young adults. Pay no attention to the overwhelming evidence that shows that this virus burns itself out once about 20% of a population has been infected.  A vaccine, that's the thing. That's your only ticket out of this dystopian nightmare."</p>

<p>The dystopian nightmare will last forever after a vaccine. The country is irreparably damaged economically and socially. And it's people that they want to live in one because Hunger Games and Maze Runner.</p>

        <p>It always seem to come down to "the virus is spreading because you are not behaving yourself." This is why I believe this is about behavior modification. It is like people in charge have a fetish for treating adults like children.</p>
