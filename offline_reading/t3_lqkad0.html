    <strong>Could we sticky a definitive resource for debating?</strong>
    <p><p>For example we can sticky a post with multiple links to sources that prove each individual point of debate with all this shit.</p>
<p>ie - a list of articles / videos of nurses and doctors admitting they were pressured to label deaths as covid</p>
<p>a long list of tik tok videos of nurses obviously not being "overwhelmed"</p>
<p>articles / videos citing how citizens of Florida, Sweden etc. are not dying more than others</p>
<p>articles / videos disproving the usefulness of masks</p>
<p>--- disproving lockdowns</p>
<p>on and on.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Would love to see something like this right at the top for everyone. If we can organize our debate point by point and present it in a format anyone can follow, that would be good right?</p></p>

        <p>I like this. Also need one with examples of “experts” undercutting their own credibility and moving goalposts</p>

        <p>It's a great idea on its face; but what's the point?</p>
<p>You really think you're going to change anybody's mind?  Anyone that comes here with the opposite position from us isn't here to have their mind changed; they're here to try to mock and belittle us.  Just read their threads, for Christ's sake.  They start with, "I was just wondering what evidence you have that lockdowns don't work, I'm genuinely curious" and when evidence is presented they pivot to the time-honored debate tactic of "I HOPE YOU DIE REEEEEEEE!!!" To make matters worse, any number of reputable scientific sources are available to 'prove' both sides of this particular debate (depending on your definition of prove, which is apparently fluid depending on political affiliation) and you'll end up arguing intangibles.  While this <em>can</em> be a pleasant diversion when it's about motorcycles or football or something, it won't be in this instance.</p>
<p>You'd be better off listing resources we can use to disprove God.  The ones who believe, believe and there's exactly nothing we can do about it.  You could have an actual mountain of evidence and it wouldn't do a lick of good.  All you'll achieve is your opponent will walk away unconvinced and you'll get to know you're right.  Exact same outcome as if you hadn't debated at all, and way easier on your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Fuck 'em.  Mock and belittle them or ignore them, but debating them is pointless.  At this point, if ye ain't fer us, yer agin' us.</p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds harsh, but it do be like that sometimes.</p>

        <p>That would be cool, but it would be a lot of work for the mods. Maybe we could all add our best resources here so it’s easier to access, and one person doesn’t have to do all the leg work. 
I know I have several links saved somewhere that I could add</p>
