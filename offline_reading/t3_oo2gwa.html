    <strong>A while ago I posted about my daughter...</strong>
    <p><p>And now that she's here I get to deal with the after effects of the 2nd jab she just got before she came down here.</p>
<p>Yesterday we were driving back to my place and while she hadn't been feeling well all day, she was looking forward to coming back to cool off and relax. Watch her anime shows and whatnot.</p>
<p>While driving I noticed her hands dropped to her lap, phone nearly falling out. And her head started nodding off the same way my son does in his carseat when he's falling asleep. I had to nudge her to let her know we were home.</p>
<p>Took her temp, 102.6 mine was 99.4 and my brother wasn't feeling well either. Gave her a small dose of children's motrin and bed rest until she started feeling better.</p>
<p>Her mother is a Marxist idiot. You don't inject KIDS with experimental drugs. She also got mad at me for making a comment about a girls piercing on a video she was watching. She freaked out and said "what if she's not a girl? What if she's non binary?"</p>
<p>I asked her why she would use the same pronouns to make her argument when I was wrong about it. I asked her if I had used other pronouns, would she have been offended anyway? I asked her what exactly was the correct way to make the observation. She crumpled up and said I'm complicating it. </p>
<p>So I told her I don't live in that reality. I'll tolerate anyone who says whatever they want, but I'll never believe there are more than two genders or use words that contradict that. I couldn't dive into the vaccines. I didn't want to scare her. </p>
<p>My kid is absolutely lost and because of her mother's decisions everyone including my son is at risk just by being around her. </p>
<p>Or it's all coincidence that's still on the table.</p></p>

        <p>I'm trying to be open minded about the culture but my belief is that our minds are whats non binary, not our bodies. And I've always been a fan of escaping labels, not adding more so I can be angry at other people for not using them...</p>

        <p>Yea, it's not about being open-minded. It's facts. If you say maybe gravity doesn't exist, it doesn't make you open-minded but crazy. Nurturing and praising identity crisis instead of helping those people is plain stupid. I'm lucky that BS is not booming yet in my part of the world but I sure can expect it in the near future.</p>

        <p>I believe one of the many bad side effects of the V that you can get is narcolepsy. That sounds like what you described. I'm so sorry. I will homeschool or move before I allow my kid to get it. He's already had the rona.</p>

        <p>That's the reality of the pro vaxx parents, they will drag your children out by the arm into those "pop-up mass vaccination sites" with or without you. You've gotta be willing to sacrifice your child to the Covid Volcano if you plan to coexist with somebody like this.</p>
