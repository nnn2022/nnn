    <strong>When is it over?</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously I understand the concept of Big Brother not wanting this “pandemic” to end but what about everyone else? Those in society who believe all the lies they’ve been told, those who freak out if anyone isn’t wearing a mask, those who believe that all of us in this sub are selfish... when is the end for them? Do they want, and therefore encourage, an eternal pandemic with dictator-level government enforcement? Or do they genuinely think the government will let us go back to normal so long as everyone was faithful in wearing a mask from the beginning? </p>
<p>It’s gotten to the point (in my personal circle) where even those against masks mandates and lockdowns barely even speak out anymore because they’re just so damn tired of having COVID be a topic of discussion at all. I’m getting worn out and I don’t see an end in sight. We’re getting a lot closer than I thought we would to the point of no return.</p></p>

        <p>Its entirely down to the individuals now. We need to spread a new virus: common sense. Push back against the sheep and take your fucking mask off. Decline the vaccine and LIVE YOUR LIFE. People will catch on and follow. If the London protests proved anything, its that we can win this if we all uphold common sense and our rights as individuals. Remember, DO NOT COMPROMISE WITH TYRANNY.</p>
<p>When you do this, more and more people will see that you don't actually have to go along with this bullshit. We just have to push these tyrants back and get through to people. </p>
<p>First they ignore you</p>
<p>Then they laugh at you </p>
<p>Then they try to fight you</p>
<p>And then you win</p>

        <p>30 years after the war on drugs some people still legitimately believe weed is evil and people should be locked up 20 years for smoking it. </p>
<p>20 years after 9/11 some people still think all the muslims are terrorists coming to destroy the airports even though TSA released a report a few years ago saying basically they had stopped zero terrorist attacks since they had been created. </p>
<p>Without a doubt this is going to be similar. The "war on viruses" they are already using the same language. Most of the bullshit restrictions won't last much more than a few years but the hysteria is something they know they can always pull out in the future.</p>
<p>The best answer is to distance yourself from sheep. Form independent communities. Vote out authoritarians or anyone who wants more power for the government. Vote out anyone pushing woke policies. And try to form your own little area of peace. That's basically what Florida, South Dakota and other places did.</p>

        <p>I checked out awhile ago.  No masks unless the business requires them and I cannot find another option that doesn’t require masks nearby.</p>

        <p>Move to TX or FL. You know what’s going to happen now. There will be variants every year and there will be boosters and masks for the rest of time.</p>

        <p>For people like me it’ll never be over.  I am livid that I’ve been put through all this, I will be seeking answers, retribution, inquiries and apologies that I will probably never receive for turning our liberal Western democracy into a dystopian surveillance state. I will continue to campaign against every twisted measure and attitude that this past year has normalised and I will continue to feel the sharp end of the economic fallout it will create. </p>
<p>For many others, their lives will never return to normal either as they have been effectively conditioned to fear their fellow human as nothing more than plague vectors and to view their life’s mission as simply to avoid death. Large crowds will probably give them overwhelming anxiety for as long as they live. </p>
<p>For most people, I think they will just return to the way they were. It’s evidenced by the fact that as soon as anything is opened up or allowed to take place again, they just flock to it, all the while observing the remaining security theatre that remains in place. It hasn’t damaged their psyche in the way it has the other two groups and they won’t take any interest in the governmental power creep that has been demonstrated. If vaccine passports are introduced, they will shrug their shoulders and consider it a good trade for the lives they once enjoyed without seeing the sinister implications. </p>
<p>The scary part is, all three groups will be acting in the earnest belief that they are doing the right thing.</p>
