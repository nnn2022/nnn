    <strong>For Parents: Have any of your kids came home completely fed up or gotten in trouble at school for not following protocol?</strong>
    <p><p>I still distinctly remember how argumentative my buds and I were over ridiculous school policies when I was in high school (07-10 to be exact). Kids frequently got into shouting matches over having their phone taken away or being told they couldn't wear hats in the building. I went to a catholic school and anytime there'd be a religious assembly in the gym, there was practically a mad dash to get out of the building and head to the mall. And of course any anti-weed propaganda was mocked - even back then people knew it was relatively harmless compared to alcohol.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine the same age group who openly laughed at administration for enforcing such bogus policies are suddenly compliant during a very obviously fake pandemic.</p>
<p>I'm curious as to just how defiant kids are right now and if any of yours have come home with hilarious stories of just walking out of class because the protocol was so asinine, or telling a teacher off. </p>
<p>If you told me I had to sit inside this little pod for band practice I'd probably just stop showing up altogether. And if I was younger and you drew a little box for me in the playground that I had to stand inside for all of recess I'd pretty quickly develop behavioral problems and act out.</p></p>

        <p>my kids are homeschooled so we have less nonsense but this year we dropped so many activities for bullshit reasons   every field trip needs a mask so we do our own with a few select families, co-op is being assinine so parents formed classes at home.  im looking at this  as 'a couple' years off but im totally ready to go all in for small groups at parents houses.  my kids want to do dance/gym etc but the studio is not reasonable so we dropped for now  , yes my kids are cranky but less cranky then trying to do flips in a mask  ugh</p>

        <p>like i previously said. a student/parent union needs to be formed that withholds all local taxpayer funded money from the schools. that way its the parents/students that have the power, not just the overly powerful selfish teacher unions</p>
