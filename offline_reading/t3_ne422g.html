    <strong>Indoctrination, Propaganda, Racial Bias, and Why the Asian Hate News Campaign Faded Away</strong>
    <p><p>Oh my.</p>
<p>It’s been a while, I’m finding less incentives to come back here. This isn’t a niche community anymore, what started as a small and discriminated pocket of soothsayers is now a well spread agenda that extends far past a subreddit, and that makes me really happy. The trains are setting off, and there’s enough people filling them without me.</p>
<p>So I guess while we’re talking about socialism, remember when the media pushed Asian hate crimes for a full week? Sure, I’ve seen Google doing Asian heritage month to tickle the balls a bit, but it seems to have faded out of the public eye, at least coming from someone who doesn’t use social media. Why is that?Well a good place to start is the BLM protests. Plenty of Americans remember the brief window of time where our country transformed into the set piece of Batman: The Dark Knight Rises. A man with counterfeit bills gets choked down on a sidewalk, and suddenly half the world knows the name George Floyd. I absolutely don’t condone the actions of those police officers for taking proper precaution, but that’s all there is, a police man who should be charged for second or third degree murder, incarcerated, and a cautionary tale to police across the nation.</p>
<p>Everything else that happened was textbook definition anarchy.</p>
<p>Fortunately I don’t think I need to smile and nod at the, er, administration I will call it, of Black Lives Matter as an organization. Many black Americans felt perfectly justified and welcome to perform assault, hate crimes, vandalism, and even murder towards White Americans. Of course, as with any nationwide party or agenda, you can’t logically put every member into one camp, but it’s naive to think stereotypes don’t exist for a reason. I criticized many gender and sexuality supporters in the past ( you know which ones ) for pretending they were like galvanized unions, because it was mostly a media driven agenda, with influencers acting as beacons for certain trains of thought, and any organization supporting one trans-rights or gay rights or feminism operating independently of the others, but BLM is no simple small scale rights organization, they are well funded and widely-encompassing.</p>
<p>A topic I am invested in spreading information on is re-education camps, whether political tools, psychological conditioners, or thinly veiled genocide machines. After Reddit banned Joe Nobody, inadvertently informing me of a new insider report ( Thank You &lt;3 ), I learned about Elam, and how people can become soulless apex predators. It just so happens, well, you should know this because politicians ( I am legally contracted by fore mentioned social media credit norms not to name either party ) have given BLM enough power to normalize racial bias training in public curriculums, so now it’s not even an education camp, it’s in our own schools. When people <em>were</em> sent to the BLM camps, they were trained on fear and anger to believe every other ethnic group in America was out to get every black person on principle and deny them basic rights. Indoctrinated members are raised upon values such as “reparations” from unknowing descendants of racist Americans of the past, and the blackening of America, marking the shift in the main demographic. Now I don’t know about you, but that sounds pretty racist towards whites <em>and</em> blacks alike. Growing up I was living in what feels like a utopia by today’s standards, people of all races collaborating in one country, blind to whatever traits accompany the others. Now, people from Black Lives are scolding white children for emulating Latin culture. Who and how and why and what the fuck. Groups like BLM seem to want their members to be racist, prejudiced, and hateful towards others, and that’s something they should, by our moral standards, aim to fix.</p>
<p>The present is rife with hate and tension, and corrupt leaders are orchestrating a future of indoctrinated bullies ready to war against their fellow citizens for control, but what about the past? America’s past was the best and worst of both worlds. There aren’t many other countries, certainly none quite as significant, who can say their own people were engulfed in civil war for the emancipation of a minority group, when the rest of the world at large continued using African slaves. Yet when black Americans were freed, the losing politicians, resentful, prejudiced, or simply power hungry, passed the Jim Crow laws to not only diminish the rights of African minorities and confine them to generations more of poverty that consequently persist to this day, but create a climate of class divide decided entirely upon who has light or dark skin, a simple visual emblem of worth in society. It didn’t matter how nice someone was at heart, if you grow up knowing to keep blacks in their place or fear whites, you will look down upon them by principle of cultural norms. That’s when Martin Luther King Jr. came in, advocating the free rights of his race and bringing light not only to his oppressed brothers and sisters, but the dominant American middle class, teaching both sides that skin color does not matter. I know that Martin Luther advocated two things above all, the power of peaceful protest and diplomacy, and the power of education, two things political powerhouses of the time deprived the community of. Propaganda can go quite a long way, but observable consequences, action, and a determined society can push it all back. Of course, many of the angry protesters could not recall what Martin Luther taught the public, they simply were not allowed to know.</p>
<p>This brings us to a point where the facade falls. Today we see the beginning of a return to prejudice, where innocent whites are held accountable for crimes of the distant past and a government beyond their control, where people are indoctrinated with basic history and statistics withheld, encouraged to hate their neighbors over petty differences, and made to believe they are not only justified, but encouraged to seize control. People are starting to call the BLM’s a terrorist group, and I’m willing to follow suit when citizens of all races in America with rational minds see how corrupt this new way of thinking is. Blacks who don’t support BLM are branded traitors, called offensive slurs, wished death upon, yet the media encourages this train of thought. In a country where thousands of crimes occur on all levels every day, but 99% are ignored in favor of the 1% that support the narrative of racial hate and police brutality, many people are bound to realize the extent of the state of neglect.</p>
<p>This brings us to the last piece of the puzzle, a ray of hope and understanding, the prior emphasis against Asian hate. The premise was simple, because the Covid virus originates from China, now everyone is racist towards Asians, so we need to identify and address the systemic racism against Asians. In fact, everyone is racist on principle, and need to be conditioned at a young impressionable age to bend a knee to welfare and reparations as mandated by our officials and spokespeople in congress, right? Well, not really, as it seems that so many people hate this notion that the media can’t even hide it all anymore, including Asian groups.</p>
<p>Now I personally adore culture and world history of all ends of life. African, Norwegian, Celtic, Gaelic, Greek, Egyptian, Turkish, Arabian, Chinese, Japanese, Mongolian, I really do appreciate our history, even if I despise humanity but more on that later, so as a culture enthusiast, bookworm, and long time video game enthusiast, let me tell you straight, ain’t nobody in MSM give a shit about Asian culture until a month ago. You could almost go believing only whites and blacks, and maybe hispanics if you don’t learn to view them as decaf whites, exist in America, but that’s far from it. No other nation in the world, the entire world, comes this close to having as much racial diversity and equal opportunity as America. Those are facts, and the media can only lie about widespread disdain towards outsiders if that’s how the numbers go. Why else do you think every other nation wants to emigrate here? If you asked any other nation to accept this many migrants, they would laugh. Why else is border patrol such a concern? We have the laxest border patrol in the world save for someplace like Timor, while we like accepting new citizens, too many illegals and criminals sneak in among the crowds to do harm to people. The Republic of China is inconceivably corrupt, any citizen there would love to escape to a free country, so when a group of people who are well accustomed to a history of corrupt socialism see signs of corrupt socialism in the country they ran to escape from corrupt socialism, you better believe plenty of them are going to speak out when the government tries to shine a spotlight on them spontaneously.</p>
<p>Even more, the deciding factor to kill Asian “awareness“ before it picked up steam was the horrible and satanic toxin of all propaganda groups, STATISTICS. It turns out that around 90% of all crimes against Asians are perpetrated by black Americans, which is not a bad thing, well it’s a very, very bad thing, but that amount sadly makes sense in a non-racist way. That’s a proportionate amount of crime in ratio to the majority of impoverished citizens in crime dense areas being african American. It’s likely not racially motivated, as a mugger typically aims for whatever middle class citizen they can rob or instill fear into, and remember, MSM loooves cherry picking. That’s another fact, Asian Americans on average have a higher quality of life, finding more business and trade opportunities in America, they’re relatively well off. Asian advocates blasted BLM supporters and thinly veiled ”Asian sympathizers“ for neglecting to address the magnitude of black on Asian crimes, because the media is trying to juggle the black protest narrative simultaneously to the Asian hate narrative they crafted. Like I said, when an organization fails to hold accountability for their member’s behavior, they should be held responsible for training their community in such a way, and to hide from those consequences, they seem to be slowly dropping the matter entirely. They seem to be doing that a lot lately, the media and corrupt leaders I mean.</p>
<p>And that’s where I see us now, whites are tired of being suppressed, blacks outside of BLM are bullied for not supporting BLM, they’re starting to bark back and unite with the rest of the country, many Asians refuse to stand for this kind of hypocrisy, Mexicans are being treated as stocks, Hispanics of all diverse Latin American nations aren’t anywhere close to wanting to be shoved into any sort of all encompassed LLM institution, and everyone of every ethnic group in America is mad at racism, and not for the obvious assumption. So what’s my take? The fact is I hate socialization. I was forced into crowds I didn’t want to be a part of, into programs I didn’t ask for, and after ignoring my pleas to be left alone for 7 years of my isolation, now the government tells the entire world, the entire fucking world, that they are forced into solitary confinement for a year, pretend there will be no consequences, and I had to watch a bunch of jerk offs across the internet, my only window to society, mindlessly accept every ass backwards order and doctrine they were given, cheering and spamming emojis and dumbass text abbreviations that were all I ever got to see as indication of how other people in America allegedly think, willingly ignorant to the millions of oppressed, homeless, suicidal, delirious, starving, addicted, and overall suffering masses of the world outside their own boxes. I hated it, I hated everyone supporting this dogma with every fiber of my being, and you know what?</p>
<p>I’m fucking tired of hate.</p>
<p>You know where I’ve been since December? East Coast Florida, ironically living on the outside for the first time in half of my life, around other people again. No one has given a shit about Covid mandates in those 5 months, lax masks, basically you can tell who is a local and who is a tourist. There are people here from all walks of life 80% of the population are elderly, all gathering in beachside cafes, socializing, enjoying their golden years, and the CDC basically fills the role left by the absence of the HOA, cause even though my local 7-11 dropped masks they came down their saying “and thus we impart onto thou the Infestation Eradication Barrier. Just don’t touch this elevated plastic, you’re perfectly secure. ^(Fucking mouth breathing scum.)” This is as close to pre-new world socialist order as it gets. I’m ( slowly but surely ) letting go of the anger, letting go of my past, but unlike some wishy-washies out there, I’m never forgetting. I think a lot of people took the modern era for granted, they believed that with these vast archives of knowledge at our disposals we would know better than ever allow a Jim Crow Holocaust Israeli conflict spread again. This scamdemic, and the years of propaganda and big tech takeover in the years leading up to this age of socialism, hate groups, corruption and censoring are a sobering reminder that no matter how advanced we seem, we should always have our guard up. The masses are always susceptible to manipulation in whatever form it takes.</p>
<p>I don’t believe we’re born prejudiced, quite the opposite, we are trained to be so. Trained to follow one group, oppose rivals, and develop a stigma against others. Being trapped in a bubble only enforces the message crammed into that bubble unless you look outside of it. That’s the plan I think, divide and conquer in whatever way seems fit. For all this talk about racism, you don’t see the quality of Chicago and Detroit rising substantially for all the funding political groups make preaching about the injustice they cultivate. Minorities lose independence and are tied to welfare, and while we aren’t the Republic of China, we like to behave like we are restricted by social credit. We’re not, we all have free rights, we’re all humans with a constitution backing those rights. Freedom of opinion, speech, discussion and debate. We test facts, not hide or ignore them, we work for our community, develop relationships as we please, and respect our laws. All we need to do to protect those rights? Keep swimming together.</p>

        <p>I could have written that. I'm moving out of state until my partner can finish school and catch up and I REALLY wanted Florida. But we're in California and she never wants to live in Florida so I'm kinda at a lose-lose, I gave in though and I'll probably end up transferring my job to Texas. I already talked to my boss about it. I can't take any more of this either, Silicon Valley is absolutely full of people on the hate train. </p>
<p>I hope Texas has some people as friendly as where you found in Florida, I've seen videos of people in Dallas and Houston partying it up and having fun being around each other and to me it looks like a utopia from here. So many people where I'm at seem like they <em>want</em>  to be miserable and terrified of the world. Also a disturbed introvert here who surprisingly misses human contact enough to want to go to a club.</p>

        <p>Oh yes, definitely friendly. I’m starting to think that all that “Florida cesspit” bandwagoning is based around politics or that people only look at Miami.

        <p>This. Every attack was Blacks on Asians. What people will not say, but is known truth in California, is that while it is “diverse” as a state, within California, Whites, Blacks, Asians, Mexicans, Republicans, and Liberals all segregate to themselves. They also tend to harbor local racial reasonings for this. It’s like the Palestinians vs Israelis. The sad part is that while they commit such acts on each other, they claim that they are all “together” against white supremacy. The media wanted everyone to buy into White Supremacy as the new Islamic terrorism post 9/11. They needed the Asians in on it too, which has been a hard group for the liberals to corral. They figured some anti Asian hate crimes blamed on White supremacy would get them in to the race fight. Unfortunately the liberals are naive of their own, and didn’t realize how many Asian hate attacks would be carried out by other minorities, because white social justice liberals in elite places like Beverly Hills really believe that minorities do no harm to each other or see each other as an enemy like they should white people. It was a botched attempt, and now they have to make it go away.</p>

        <p>Just look at the “Teen vaping illnesses” that the liberal media was pushing in the news late 2019. They swore this “new illness” was sweeping across the country killing teenagers at an alarming rate. They wanted the public on board with banning vaping, so they took Covid illness and tried to pass it off as “vaping illness.” Why do you think such a strange new disease disappeared as soon as Covid took the media reigns? Because Covid broke the gates for far more of what they wanted control wise than banning vaping would. Now look at society, thanks Covid. Also, in regards to the vaping illness, you ever notice how young kids were “immune” or that there was “severe lacking cases” of Covid amongst children? My theory is that the vaping illness was Covid, and affected the children first, granting the ones that survived it immunity. This is why adult cases “spiked” while child cases were non existent all 2020. They already had it in 2019! It also explains why you don’t hear about the big bad “vaping illness” anymore, because it was Covid all along! I haven’t heard any vaccine updates or rushes to create a vaccine or do research on this “vaping illness” since Covid took charge. How could the medical community be so careless to negate a vaping illness that is new and killing children! What about the children!!! Yeah, guess the children don’t matter. Or, it was Covid all along, and that’s why you don’t hear of it anymore. Because there’s no way a deadly disease that was gonna ban a prominent product in America just disappeared. According to liberals that claim, “scientists care about humans and want to extend the life expectancy with vaccine” why would they not rush to create a vaccine for the vaping illness? Where’s the FDA rush to approve? Oh yeah.....</p>
