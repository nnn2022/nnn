    <strong>Dentist Rant</strong>
    <p><p>When COVID first kicked off for us, over night I lost my company. No joke or exaggeration. My entire client list cancelled. We did event catering. After the initial two weeks to flatten the curve and then the next 8 months, stuff was tricky. As you can imagine. Fast forward to when the world opened a smidge. Two days later our dentist called to say that they had an opening for our family to ‘catch up after COVID’ family clean and the works. Receptionist lists all the requirements of us, sit in the car, call to say we’re here, one family member at a time - we had a toddler at the time - good luck with that. Yadda yadda yadda $10 per person added to cover the cost of additional PPE. On top of a potential family charge of $450-$600 - descale and polish for us all and they usually squeeze in x ray updates. </p>
<p>Hold up, what? </p>
<p>$10 for what? (Not covered by our medical plan)</p>
<p>Additional PPE.</p>
<p>Uh huh, being what exactly?</p>
<p>Additional cleaning and masks and sanitizer.</p>
<p>So, $40 extra for our visit?</p>
<p>Yeah, no big deal, says receptionist.</p>
<p>I push back. Explain that the dentist surgery should already be sterile per visit and that we have our own masks (we hate). </p>
<p>She blusters forward</p>
<p>Again I counter</p>
<p>Her response is: Well, other practices are charging $50 extra per visit. </p>
<p>They still call.</p>
<p>We have a new dentist.</p></p>

        <p>This is the way.  Stop giving money to those that are part of this problem.</p>
<p>I don’t even argue.  If a store requires a mask I just go somewhere else.  I’ll probably still end up giving them money through taxes when they destroy their own business and wonder why.</p>

        <p>They try to pull stuff like this because they know most people just go "Okay..." and pay it.</p>
<p>At my old dentist's I was paying for cleanings out of pocket because I didn't have insurance at the time. Every six months the dentist would look at my mouth for five seconds and then give me a new sales pitch. Finally I said, "I don't know why I'm paying all this money to get my teeth cleaned here if you're going to keep trying to sell me solutions to problems that don't exist. What if I come in yearly instead of every six months?" The dentist didn't like that, so she tells me that they can't schedule that far in advance. I say, "Fine. Then I'll call you if I decide to make another appointment here."</p>
<p>That was over two years ago and they're still sending me correspondence in the mail that says I'm "overdue" for an appointment. smh</p>

        <p>The state I practice in mandated that staff wear gowns for each procedure, a new gown for each patient.  Disposable surgical gowns used to cost about $0.50 each, during COVID they cost $9.00 each, if you could even find them.  </p>
<p>Similarly, gloves that used to cost $5.00/box, increased in price to $30-$50 per box.  </p>
<p>Dentists were passing on the costs to you, like any business would.</p>

        <p>For the amount of money - mainly siphoned directly from the government in health benefits and the high mark up for everything, they could absorb these cost increases. A bit more humility when hundreds of thousands of small businesses have simply been erased. Couldn’t pass the extra costs to my clients!</p>
