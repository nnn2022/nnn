<title>Family is "concerned for my well-being" because I'm unvaccinated. Where the fuck was that concern for the past year and a half when I was depressed and having suicidal thoughts due to this fucking absurd clown show?</title>

    <strong>Family is "concerned for my well-being" because I'm unvaccinated. Where the fuck was that concern for the past year and a half when I was depressed and having suicidal thoughts due to this fucking absurd clown show?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm honestly losing all fucking hope here, guys. My sister asked me if I was "double jabbed" today so I just stared at her until she blurted out "GET VACCINATED!" I said I had plenty of reasons not to, including that one of my friends almost died after getting his first "jab", and she just kept repeating "there is no good excuse" back at me. I pointed out the 99.9% survival rate, how no one I know has died from it (she countered this by saying people in her age group had been hospitilized by it; still, not dead, are they?) and how I can still get and spread the virus even if I'm "fully vaccinated".</p>
<p>All the usual arguments came out then: you won't be able to go on holiday ("don't care"), you could spread it to others ("they've had the vaccine so they're fine and if they're not then it doesn't work") and finally that she's concerned for my well-being and health. Never mind the fucking fact that being stuck in for a year and having my entire life upended at a moment's notice has left me severely depressed. I'd never do it but I've had intrusive thoughts about suicide now and again, as I'm sure a fair few of us have. But nah, that doesn't matter: lOcKdOwNS aNd mAsKS sAvE lIveS!!1</p>
<p>I said I was probably more likely to have a bad reaction to the jabs (she makes a sweeping arm gesture at the rest of my family "everyone here has had the vaccine and they're fine! Yes we all felt terrible for a few days afterwards but that's it!") and that I've seen countless videos of people having terrible reactions ("that's not research!") and that frankly I'm fucking terrified of it. (Blank stare "so?")</p>
<p>I'm just so fucking sick and tired of this shit now and it's going to get fucking worse for all of us. No one is thinking logically. Threads on the Coronavirus subreddit are filled with hateful fascists calling for our segregation and forced vaccination, and yet they still believe they're the fucking good guys. The propaganda is so fucking obvious it's physically painful to me how people can't fucking see through it. I feel like slamming my fucking head into my computer desk over and over again.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for all the kind comments and awards everyone. The doomers REALLY fucking hate this post judging by it being 69% upvoted and all the abusive comments left. Fucking hilarious and pathetic. You can all go fuck yourselves. </p></p>

        <p>Huh. This is happening in my family now and other users are saying the same. Its like a switch flipped on and they became mini Faucis. </p>
<p>My family has never been this relentless about an issue before so it's very unnatural. I have a feeling yours weren't that relentless in the past either.</p>
<p>Edit: Just remembered that I had a conversation a month ago about the shot but it wasn't much. Family just said they don't care and it's my right to decline the vaccine. Something definitely changed here.</p>

        <p>Well, I have heard that the vax will activate something in these people and they will become violent and enraged. "Zombified" if you will.  No, i dont know the sCiEnCe behind this but it seems to be the case. </p>
<p>Also, would guess it has to be partly due to SO MANY people getting duped on a mass level, the collective consciousness of this planet is erupting as Truth is revealed. Gonna get messier and messier on an emotionally energetic planetary field as we move forward, but through pain is healing on the other side.</p>

        <p>I recently went on a trip to Yellowstone with my sister and dad. We were flying home from Bozeman MT. I saw some people without masks in the airport so I decided to take mine off. My sister (fully vaxxed and one of those types that posted a vaccine selfie on social media) kept badgering me to put my mask on. She told me I wasn’t the only one who didn’t want to wear them. I still didn’t put it on. She came over later and told me she thought long and hard about this and that she no longer wanted me to talk to her ever again. Claims it wasn’t about the mask but we just had different morals and that I didn’t care about family. She said to no longer consider her my sister/family. </p>
<p>I was fucking shocked. This came out of nowhere and I asked her if she was really going to exclude me from her life just because I have different views and beliefs and she said yes. I told her I wouldn’t exclude her for her different views and she said that she’s just a bad person then. When I went to charge my phone by her she grabbed my charger and clutched it, saying I needed to put my mask on. I said fine I won’t charge my phone then, gimme my charger back. She gave it back and I packed it and walked away. </p>
<p>After the flight she did apologize for being mean to me but holy shit the vaxxed have become this strange parasitic hive mind entity that can’t see past the rules that were implemented.</p>

        <p>It doesn't have anything to do with a physiological response to the vaccine, and is entirely psychological. It could be due to any number of factors: fear, cognitive dissonance, PTSD, narcissism, the list goes on. The result is the same regardless, and was coined the amygdala hack by Daniel Goleman. Everyone knows of it more commonly as the "fight or flight" response. Behavioral signs of being forced into an amygdala response include anger, fear, aggression, and sudden illogical overreaction to the situation at hand. Sound familiar?</p>

        <p>You can throw all science out the window at this point. They could've had magic help from demons to make this and I wouldn't bat an eye. Buried inbetween all the psyposts and surveys I keep seeing a lot of articles that basically say we know nothing, and what we did know is unraveling with new conflicting details. New types of humans, new quantum mechanics, aliens prep, new particles and states of matter, new rules coming. And maybe they knew about this before telling us, and the shot is based on that technology. We cannot know.</p>

        <p>Did this happen to anyone else my age (I'm 55)? Back when I was in HS (early 1980's) we would have assemblies during school with some sort of entertainment. A few times I remember a hypnotist performing with volunteer student subjects. I didn't think about it at the time but now I wonder if it was some sort of test. I'm probably being too paranoid.</p>

        <p>Indeed. 
The people have been hypnotized by the media 24/7 with pandemic coverage . 
And when the government scares the entire population to death with an invisible threat, locks them up and muzzles them for a year and a half, and seperates them from their loved ones and any physical contact, people will line up to take whatever will give them back their freedom and sense of connection again.
Plus the per pressure to get a shot to prevent another lockdown or you're considered basically a mass murderer. 
People have been brainwashed and now they are trying to turn us against eachother. 
Just saw a FB advertisement encouraging you to "talk to your unvaccinated neighbors" about the importance of the covid shot.</p>

        <p>Well, they've known how to control people through propaganda for millennia but if you mean through the Hz they shoot through the radioactive waves then that's totally a possibility... the injection of whatever that was, is probably largely contributing... perhaps radioactivizing the peoples body with whatever particles it contains and more powerfully influencing the people now.</p>

        <p>Are you talking about fluoride? now I don't know exactly how that would be used as direct 'mind control' but in this clown world who knows. I do believe fluoride is absolutely detrimental to human health in the quantities that are consumed (if there is even a requirement at all that is) and in conjunction its effects are made worse by the laughably small 150ug RDA for iodine, as well as the substitution of iodine for bromine for bread leavening have all severely effected peoples health which could easily induce significant reduction in brain development which is evident by talking with the common person even if they haven't been heavily propagandized. </p>
<p>Fluoride and bromide displace iodine in the body, and iodine is the key ingredient that is utilized in the functioning of all glandular tissue in the body.</p>

        <p>Well my family doesn't cite authoritative sources but rather gossip and social media posts. My sources are from the CDC, DOD, state Health department, and top doctors that work with all of these agencies. Their research shows that I'm not at risk nor do I need a vaccine. And the data shows that very few people died from it. In my area of 440,000 people, only 780 died from Covid and most of them had pre existing medical conditions such as asthma, pneumonia, and other illnesses according to the CDC.</p>
<p>People like to throw the federal death count because it seems scary but in reality the feds don't separate probable deaths with Covid from confirmed deaths by Covid. Many of those who died had other serious medical conditions as listed on the CDC's website. </p>
<p>Do you want to know how many people died in America since the beginning of 2020? A staggering 5,200,000 people.</p>
<p>2018? The number of deceased was 72,360,000.</p>
<p>2017? A total of 73,190,000 people.</p>
<p>America had a population of 328,200,000 in 2019. What is it now? 333,125,000. A lot of people die but they are replaced through reproduction. Point is, the media manipulated you and used clickbait to sell you an experimental medicine that has deadly side effects. They intentionally cherry picked data to make things seem more serious than they actually are and it worked.</p>

        <p>&rt;Their research shows that I'm not at risk nor do I need a vaccine.</p>
<p>thats not exactly correct. YOUR interpretation of the research you have SEEN and from what your untrained self can understand and pull information from. 
Without the lens and training of expertise and experience you probably dont know the difference between the various methods or receptors or gene sequences. 
Have you asked your doctor? If you have, did you listen to what the doctor said or did you attempt to argue with the doctor telling him youre young and healthy and at low risk of mortality....? </p>
<p>&rt;Many of those who died had other serious medical conditions as listed on the CDC's website. </p>
<p>If i get bit by a shark and am in the hospital recovering...then catch covid and die. Covid is the cause of death......if you have asthma and you live with it day to day and then the covid makes your shitty breathing ability even shitter....the covid killed you. 
Serious medical conditions excuse is the utilitarian euphamism for fuckem they were gonna die anyway. </p>
<p>&rt;Point is, the media manipulated you and used clickbait to sell you an experimental medicine that has deadly side effects. They intentionally cherry picked data to make things seem more serious than they actually are and it worked.</p>
<p>You mean just like you cherry picked data from your personal town? Or cherry picking the deaths of the co-morbidities and ignoring the deaths of athletes and young people and regular 30 to 50 year olds? </p>
<p>Asprin can kill you tylenol and ib profin can cause liver failure, womens birth control cause more blood clots than the vaccines. Only 3 people have died from the vaccine. Experimental? They tested it before the emergency FDA approval. If you trust authoratative sources why not trust the FDA?</p>
<p>Most medicine is experimental seeing how the human body is a complex juggling act of hormones levels.. why do you think doctors have you TRY medications for a week or 2 or a month and check you out to see if they need to try a different type. Kinda like some people SWEAR by advil while others say tylenol or ib profin. People are different.</p>

<p>Yet you trust the "CDC stat that tells you you have 0 risk" what makes that broadcast more valid than the other broadcasts by the CDC that says get vaccinated?</p>

        <p>Effectively zero*. I’m young, fit, eat healthy and work out 5 times a week. No underlying health conditions. I do not give a flying fuck if I get covid, and the vaccine poses a much larger risk (if I got the vaccine, I would feel more sick after than if I got covid as well). I’m just balancing risk.</p>

        <p>Any educated guess is only an educated guess. Without the act of experimentation, there is no working theory that may contribute anything worthwhile. Without access to all the data, due to competitive confidentiality agreements, there is no chance for independent verification of the same data. The data sets vary from multiple different isolated virus DNA sequences, actual sex, race, income data, health insurance data, age and pre-existing conditions of vaccine recipients and the unvaccinated and who exactly are hospitalized and their time to full recovery or subsequent mortality, a random, blind spot check and double blind verification of custody/control and actual substances found in multiple different vaccines and PCR tests across multiple times during the year. Since the government is the customer, they should be privy to all of this information. Since the government works for the people, we should be able to use FOIA to secure this information.

        <p>&rt;Any educated guess is only an educated guess. Without the act of experimentation</p>
<p>Well the experimentation is ive taken lots of meds and my doctors havent ever fucked me up. So my experimentation is trust the expert who i pay to give me advice about something they have forgotten or stashed away more knowlege on the topic that i knew there was to know. Pharmacology, toxicology,  human biology, hormones, brain receptors, and drug interactions gene expressions, gene combinations allergies. Theres a laundry list of shit a doctor studies and even more to specialize. If you think you have the capacity to make an "educated" decision without those years or experience then you are a god among men and we should bow at your glory.</p>
<p>&rt;independent verification</p>
<p>Who would you be happy to review it? Which org in particular?</p>
<p>&rt;Without access to all the data, due to competitive confidentiality agreements, there is no chance for independent verification of the same data.</p>
<p>&rt;The data sets vary from multiple different isolated virus DNA sequences, actual sex, race, income data, health insurance data, age and pre-existing conditions of vaccine recipients and the unvaccinated and who exactly are hospitalized and their time to full recovery or subsequent mortality, a random, blind spot check and double blind verification of custody/control and actual substances found in multiple different vaccines and PCR tests across multiple times during the year.</p>
<p>How do we simultaneously not have access to the data but have access to the required and necessary data to start studies? The FDA approval process is very long and very expensive. No company would want to spend thier time and resources EVEN IF they cant be sued, if thier product is gonna be trashed shortly after launch.
 J&amp;J almost immediately pulled thier product when there was the slightest hint at issue. And following a study found that wasnt the case. </p>
<p>Edit: forgot to delete after i had to go back and reread a bit.</p>
<p>&rt;Since the government is the customer, they should be privy to all of this information.</p>
<p>That doesnt apply any where else.....if that was true then apple should be giving everyone access to the source code since we are the customer. Or these medical companies have to make public intellectual property in trade/research techniques and patents.. </p>
<p>&rt;Since the government works for the people, we should be able to use FOIA to secure this information. That would be a pretty good start.</p>
<p>Again rephrased so you want to violate a private companys intellectual property rights? Pfizer didnt take andy grant money they ran it on thier own dime until they had a product theat met the FDAs emergency standard. You would steal from them?</p>

        <p>Even my parents, who are lockdown sceptics (my mom quite vehemently so; she also hates masks), recently went on a spiel to me about how I should take the vaccine "just to be on the safe side" and because "it will make things easier".</p>
<p>I blame the mainstream media. It's hard not to internalise the vaccine narrative -- even when you've previously questioned NPIs -- because vaccines seem like "real" science by comparison, plus other vaccines save us from horribly crippling illnesses, so why shouldn't we trust the covid vaccines?</p>

<p>The first part is connected to the second part -your parents believe that everyone vaccinated = no lockdowns or masks. You know when you were in elementary school with a teacher would make everyone sit quietly until everyone was quiet, and one kid kept talking and prolonging the ordeal? That's how they see you right now.</p>

        <p>My mother is in a tizzy because I don't want to get vaccinated. Initially, I pushed off the subject, saying my age group wasn't eligible yet. Eventually, I 'came out' and told her I had no plans to get it. </p>
<p>I've been speaking to her less over the phone, because she tries to 'evangelize' about it. Mostly with MSM talking points. I don't see a point arguing. I don't really blame her. She's older and her main information source is the TV.</p>

        <p>It's because despite whatever conspiracy people believe, for the most part things are back to normal in 90% of the country, and the overwhelming majority of people would like it to stay that way and have come to the conclusion of the unvaccinated stand in the way of that. I know it's invoked claim that it's some kind of mind control serum or whatever (or whatever the latest conspiracy theory is) but for most people it's just the fact that they're sick of all of this and want things to go back to normal, and have come to the conclusion that people who aren't vaccinated arer standing in the way of that.</p>

        <p>Perhaps blame corrupt politicians instead of people who aren't even at risk. Also none of the mRNA manufacturers said their product slowed the spread of Covid and the CDC has confirmed it, hence the new mask guidelines. It was designed only to reduce symptoms and since I'm in the group that's not at risk, it's not necessary for me.</p>
<p>It's time for you to direct your anger at politicians that manipulated you and is now refusing to give up the power they gave themselves. Deploying the military to place an entire country under house arrest? Dividing the country into first and second class citizens according to the government's definition? Control the private sector by closing businesses with just a single mandate? These are steps to tyranny not a healthier society.</p>

<p>Now that's another false claim. Those statistics include those who died from other causes but had tested positive. Even then, the CDC confirms that those who have multiple medical conditions and are very old are the most at risk of dying. Those who are young with no pre existing conditions aren't even at risk of hospitalization.</p>
<p>So try again.</p>

        <p>I see your point about the struggle when multiple things are happening at once but that happens whenever anyone dies with multiple issues, not just with Covid.  </p>
<p>No measurement system is ever going to be 100.00% accurate (and we probably wouldn’t want to pay what it would cost even if we could).  But at some point, if a decision isn’t made about how to define/collect data, we wouldn’t have any information at all which would be worse.</p>
<p>Though IMO, even if the deaths are off by 50%, it is still a pretty shocking tragedy.</p>

        <p>I don't like to see people die but millions die in America each year. In 2018 it was around 73,000,000 people. In 2020 it was in the ballpark of 55,000,000. Lots of people have medical conditions and die. My grandpa was healthy then suddenly his organs started shutting down one by one over the course of two days until he died. It's just a sad reality and they used that reality to manipulate people.</p>

<p>There’s been some interesting statistics done on the “normal” death rate and the “excess” from Covid.  I am definitely not a statistician though, so you’ll have to read those and judge for yourself.  </p>

        <p>Covid has detrimental long term cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurological effects. The vaccine does not based on the data available. That may change, but MRNA has been in development for over 30 years. It's well understood. At this time, everything we know about the vaccines tell us they are safe. And everything we know about COVID tells us you could still be facing issues from it in 5 years. </p>
<p>Sure lockdowns suck, I won't deny that. But this sub is deluded: "Lockdowns bad, so covid is a hoax, the vaccines don't work (except when they do) the vaccines have terrible side effects that don't have any documentation, but it's because there's a huge conspiracy". It's like you're incapable of seeing any kind of middle ground. Lockdowns have been hell for a lot of people's mental health. And a great way to end them is to push the vaccine. If you don't want to get it, that's on you. But don't pretend that you know anything about how it works, because you obviously don't.</p>

<li>No one says covid is a hoax. Strawman</li>
<li>These vaccines are so efficient, they need boosters and leave a few thousand people severely disabled or dead. How great.</li>

<p>Most gullible people have already been vaxxed. There should be some normalcy by now. And also ''If you don't want to get it, that's on you.'' Sadly, it isn't. Look at France or Italy.</p>

<p>A ton of people absolutely still say it's a hoax. Or a "psy-op" or whatever stupid term you want to use. </p>

<li>
<p>WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING FROM THE VACCINE???? I keep hearing this, but I haven't been able to find a single actual source. But even if that were true, I keep hearing people go on about the survival rate of covid. If thousands have died, that makes it a 99.999999% survival rate for the vaccine as BILLIONS of doses have been given. 
Not to mention the fact that there are also traditional vaccines available for covid. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, not sure where you're from, but I was referencing the situation as an American. Where I live things aren't fully normal, but there absolutely has been a massive shift back in that direction. We're nearing 60% vaccinated, but  in order to achieve true herd immunity against a highly transmissible disease, it needs to be closer to 80%-90%.</p>

        <p>VAERS is not a verified source on anything... That website is for aggregating tips about POTENTIAL side effects so they can be investigated. </p>
<p>But let's assume all of the reported incidents are accurate. That's 4,533 reported covid vaccination deaths. Out of 4.1 billion doses given. That means it occurs less than 0.000001% of the time. And again, these are <em>reported</em> not <em>confirmed</em> so the actual numbers are likely much lower.</p>

        <p>Here in india I know of 3 people that died of a heart attack within 3 weeks after taking the vaccine. They're giving az here which is known for bloodclots. All three of them were termed as not related to vaccines. The reason is simple government doesn't want people to become hesitant of the vaccine or cause them to panic. Many cases can be found in r/covidvaccinated where doctor would say severe reactions just after the vaccines aren't related to vaccines even though they quite literally are. They're simply not counting.It's literally happening in front of our eyes. Obviously the drones will keep reaching the opposite conclusion by drinking the propoganda kool aid. They're so deluded it's near impossible to even have a conversation with some of these people. Part of them being deluded is that they believing coercing people into taking this experimental jab is a good thing. Absolute boot licking loonies.</p>

<p>Objective data shows vaccine isn't even close to the 90% efficacy they're claiming. Half of new cases are vaccinated people. You're being deceived into believing this will go away once the magic 80-90% vaccination hits. Herd immunity is objectively impossible if this level of vaccinated people are capable of spreading to other vaccinated people.</p>

        <p>I'm happily vaccinated, test when i need to make sure to protect susceptible people around me, and enjoy myself all the time without worry. There's a reason that 99% of the deaths in the last few months are in unvaccinated idiots. I'm perfectly happy to let people like you kill and maim yourself due to your stupidity, but sometimes it's harder to stay silent when merely the suggestion of a vaccine brings out an immediate godwin's rule.

        <p>Well obviously you can't prove a negative, so I'm going to assume you're engaging instead of attempting to make a bad faith argument. </p>
<p>But <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2771111">this</a> is a great article in a medical journal detailing how long haulers are experiencing symptoms regardless of their pre-existing conditions, or the severity of their initial infection. And <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/acn3.51350">this</a> is a very interesting paper on neurological long term effects of covid. This study focuses on individuals whose initial infection was not severe enough to warrant hospitalization.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your response and your links. My understanding is that coronaviruses are potentially the cell death sequence initiator of apoptosis, with this in mind, anyone coming down with a sickness surely would have some of this floating around in the system. It looks like your studies simply observed people after they tested "positive" whilst being sick. Unfortunately, your papers don't seem to address the actual causes of these issues, and does nothing to suggest there could be something besides coronaviruses causing it. </p>
<p>Perhaps I missed it over my initial review of your articles, but is there any evidence of these "long haul" symptoms being concretely proven and confirmed to have been caused by the variants people were infected with? Or is this just sort of a "well they got sick and we found this gene sequence in them, so maybe it caused it and we're just gonna run with that and keep an eye on the patient" because that's what it reads as, and I'm having a hard time finding anything otherwise.</p>

        <p>So, at this time the only link is correlation between infection with nCoV-19 and the long haul symptoms (as far as I am aware). Correlation does not determine causation, but it's certainly reason to look for a causual link. Right now, overwhelming data points to the vaccines being safe, and only correlative data points towards covid causing long haul effects. There have been 4.1 billion covid shots given, which is a very large data set on the vaccine. Long haulers, are (luckily) a much smaller data set. The view of long haul symptoms may change as our understanding of the virus does. </p>
<p>There are people who are sycophantic in their pushing of the vaccine, sure. But there are so many more fear mongering about the shots. I understand skepticism, and I don't begrudge anyone for being skeptical. My only issue is those that are "skeptical" simply because they don't understand the topic.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised and grateful to have gotten such a thoughtful response in this subreddit. Most people are saying I'm a "nazi" or "shill". I believe in accepting the data you are presented with, and reevaluating if presented with new data.</p>

        <p>I think the vaccines work pretty well on high risk groups. We've seen the death rates crash. But forcing every single person on earth to get a vaccine for a virus that poses zero risk to most of them? No thanks. I'll get the vaccine - in 50 years when I'm 80 and need it. You wanna blame anyone for this mess? Blame China for releasing covid onto the world. Dont blame your fellow countrymen for being skeptical of the government. Its weird how the same people that call the government fascist, racist and evil, also side with the government every chance they get. It's almost like they've bought into the Bezos/billionaire class propaganda while claiming to hate him. You guys carry water for Big Pharma, that's not something I can get on board with as someone that's lost a brother to oxycontin.</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? "All flu is covid"? Covid is definitely different from the flu, though many symptoms are the same. China created Covid-19 in a lab to spread easier than the flu and they were apparently pretty successful. I'm not sure what your point is, are you saying we've cured the flu by releasing covid onto the world? How is that a good thing when covid has killed more than the flu does? How much is Xi paying you? The claim that the flu has been defeated is ridiculous anyways, they claimed my city had 0 flu cases despite thousands of sick people going to covid testing sites and getting negative for covid. Common sense tells us they had the flu. But they dont report that for some reason, lol.</p>

        <p>The Covid-19 shot does not prevent people from catching the disease.  The shot does not stop people from spreading the disease even from one inoculated person to another.  The push for lockdowns will never end.  Delta is making a lot of people sick but the death rate is not rising.  You want to end Covid-19?  Tell fat people to stop trashing their bodies with food that is bad for them but you won't do that because 'fat shaming'.</p>

There is a lot of stuff you can do for your parents with even focused meditation. I have witnessed amazing healing just with the mind. I’m actually a very skeptical person who just happened to grow up learning this stuff… our ancient roots teach these methods… they really can and do work :)</p>

        <p>Dr. Robert Malone who was involved in inventing mRNA expresses his concern that the spike isn’t an antigen but rather a bio active protein that opens the brain blood barrier. He also says they have no idea how much spike protein is being made in the body and are taking a “fake it until we make it” approach. So after being invaded with these spiked proteins will the body need another infusion for regulation?</p>

        <p>Partly because he’s NOT the inventor of mRNA vaccines. He’s the inventor of exactly jack-shit. He worked on one early project (as part of a team) involving mRNA transfection, but hasn’t been involved in the field for over 30 years.

        <p>I looked at his CV and he has tons of credible work for decades. Why is it that every scientist who questions this is labeled a “quack?” Even ones with 30 years experience? Is Michael Yeadon a “quack” too? I don’t know… seems like a more credible argument is that the real quacks are the ones driving this forward without any sense of caution or debate… it’s really strange to me how debate isn’t allowed… and anyone that dares disagree is a “quack”</p>

        <p>lol you really think capitalism wouldn't do that? the same system that drives corporations like Montsanto to genetically engineer sterile seeds so that you have to keep buying seeds (which has caused the current heirloom seed shortage)</p>
<p>These people are A-OK with making FOOD, a BASIC necessity, into a luxury item that you can't even grow yourself anymore if you wanted to. they are ok with giving themselves a fucking monopoly on a plant humans have been eating for thousands of years, just so they can profit more. Fuck the consequences to the environment, the possibility of creating a global food shortage crisis because we really don't understand the consequences of our science as well as some egotists would like to give themselves credit for.</p>
<p>But no, of course they would NEVER make people dependent on pharmaceuticals which they have to keep paying for or die. That totally doesn't already happen ALL THE FUCKING TIME</p>

        <p>I get information from ALL SOURCES of information. I personally discern the difference between reliable and unreliable sources of information. For example, you have not proven to be a reliable source of any useful information, so I am not relying on you as a source of my information. Nice try though. Kudos for the effort. I’m honored that you care so much, but if you continue to fail to provide me with any useful information, you shall continue to be consistently categorized in this manner.</p>
<p>Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and YouTube are generally just as reliable a source as any other MSM, and that includes FoxNews, which I rely on even less than the aforementioned technology information aggregation companies. </p>
<p>The reason? Because they censor sources of information, which causes me to suspect that they do not trust me to discern between valid and invalid sources of information, which in turn makes me suspect that they are only one tool for my use in identifying sources of information. You can censor but you cannot censor and be considered a reliable source of information at the same time.</p>

        <p>Yea when they say they've been "fully vaccinated" look surprised and ask "oh so you've had your 3rd/booster shot already??". Then when they look confused show them the pfizer recommendations that a 3rd booster shot is likely required in the next 6 months to achieve full full immunity. Maybe that will raise their eyebrows.</p>

        <p>If you've received your second dose at the very beginning of January 2021, your vaccine pass has already <a href="https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/croatia-becomes-the-first-country-to-set-a-maximum-validity-period-of-covid-19-vaccination-certificates/">expired and can't be used to enter Croatia</a> without additional testing.

<p>Plus the people who yelled at you if you dared to have any preference about the brand you want to take just a couple of months ago when there were 'shortages', now deem J&amp;J and AZ somewhat worthless.

        <p>Lolol. I had to duckduckgo that. The fact that you know it, maybe you know more. I totally agree about people having the firewall up.. that's what happens when generations have been dumbed down psychologically, chemically and socially.  I was reading some L Ron Hubbard quotes recently and some of his quotes are pretty fire. He actually mentions, if for whatever reason, all the people on the lower end of consciousness suddenly died, we would all be lifted up all of a sudden, and i totally agree. We might get that wish actually.</p>

        <p>yeah that seems too optimistic to me. Now they are ramping up this delta variant narrative...if your scenario were actually true, they would be just about done by now. Everyone who volunteered like an idiot to get the untested experimental gene therapy shot which the manufacturers have no liability for, already got theirs. But...it hasn't ended yet nonetheless. Why is that? What I see happening is vaccinated people going rabid on us, because they are being brainwashed to blame us for the revocation of their hard-won privileges now, so I imagine the next step is to persecute us with violence or financial coercion.</p>

        <p>Okay, if that's the case, why would they leave the people who clearly are skeptical of everything and don't listen to them? Wouldn't they leave the sheeple who immediately got vaccinated as their slaves?</p>

        <p>My dad took the AZ shot months ago, and a week ago took the Moderna, and now is talking about taking J&amp;J next just to “prove the science is right”.. </p>
<p>Who tf gave you the task to prove anything firstly, secondly he’s got a red eye now all of a sudden bc of blood clotting most likely in my non medical opinion (why the hell would you have bloodshot eyes for no reason?) </p>
<p>I was truly baffled but im past the stage of caring.. everybody has free choice and if you want to be a free Labrat for pharma, nobody can stop you. Also, I remember in previous studies of drugs or whatever they used to pay ppl and the side effects weren’t too much..Hes not even getting paid smdh.</p>

        <p>I have a staunch pro-vax friend, in his early 30s, who took two shots of AZ and had "side effects" right away, and now suffers with shortness of breath and severe chest pain for hours from the smallest exertion (or sometimes just sitting on the couch) and his hands and feet randomly swell up.  He denies all that could be from the jabs, but he says even if it is, he's fine with it because he's "doing the right thing" and I am selfish for not doing it and he thinks it is ME who is going to die.  I can't even.</p>

        <p>So doing the right thing is to die and shut up. And the wrong thing is to reject putting something ur body u don’t know the long term effects of, and seen some of the horrific short term side effects already.. Sorry I don’t want no myocarditis and blood clots. If that makes me wrong I don’t wanna be right 😂</p>

        <p>Lol @ diving headfirst into the grave!!  Totally agree man, well it's helped separate the real ones from the fake for me. I won't just have "blind compassion" for everyone because everyone is definitely not deserving. "Don't save her she don't wanna be saved" - J Cole.  Selective compassion for those who care enough to care about themselves though, and young children who will be the future for us!! That is where energy should be focused.</p>
<p>Some  of these people diving headfirst, i think on a spiritual and soul level, they have made an agreement to leave this planet. And I'm glad, we can't have that negativity with this next wave of humanity which needs to be more conscious than before.</p>

        <p>Moderna was up shit creek before Covid.  They couldn't get any vaccines or therapies approved.  All of a sudden, the Covid vaccine supposedly works flawlessly.</p>
<p>Covid is a simple virus for them to succeed with, but so is Zika, and their Zika vaccine was not approved.</p>
<p>BTW, the biggest advantage of MRNA vaccines is they can be produced quickly.  J and J only lagged behind by a couple of months.  Also, a lot of vaccines are coming out of patent.  This is why Gates is constantly jerking off about investing in these techs.  They want a new tech like MRNA to work desperately so they can patent new therapies they can claim are better to push the old vaccines off of the market.</p>

        <p>Right. It's an experimental gene therapy meant to suppress the symptoms without stopping the spread at all.</p>
<p>They only call it a vaccine in order to cover its experimental nature with the broadly accepted legitimacy of traditional vaccines.</p>
<p>The truth is, there was no way they could have made a traditional vaccine in less than a year. It's all been a sham and they're using millions of people as guinea pigs.</p>

<p>Check out even just the Wikipedia page and there's a section on it's emerging use for various diseases (including respiratory inflammatory diseases) as a gene therapy and how it may be of use in CRISPR gene editing techniques.</p>

        <p>Yeah…. None of that is remotely correct, but nice try. </p>
<p>mRNA doesn’t “interrupt the synthesizing” of anything. It contains the instructions to make the viral spike-protein, which is then expressed on the surface of cells. The immune system recognizes it as a foreign protein, and mounts a defense.</p>

<p>From what I've read, the vaccine has killed (arguably) about three people from an extremely rare blood clotting problem.</p>

        <p>Ahhh, you don’t know what the word “vaccine” means, got it. Here’s some help from the handy-dandy dictionary:</p>
<p>“a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease.”</p>
<p>Now, which part of that definition isn’t satisfied by mRNA or vector based vaccines? I’ll wait.</p>

Vaccine: “Suspensions of killed or attenuated microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa), antigenic proteins, synthetic constructs, or other bio-molecular derivatives, administered for the prevention, amelioration, or treatment of infectious and other diseases.”</p>
<p>Taber’s Online Medical Dictionary
Vaccine: “Any suspension containing antigenic molecules derived from a microorganism, given to stimulate an immune response to an infectious disease. Vaccines may be made from weakened or killed microorganisms; inactivated toxins; toxoids derived from microorganisms; or immunologically active surface markers extracted or copied from microorganisms. They can be given intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally, orally, or intranasally; as single agents; or in combinations.”</p>

        <p>I'm happy to call the COVID-19 drug a vaccine when it acts like a vaccine and goes through the standard testing and approval process.  Plus the removal of litigation protections.  Until then... it's just an experimental drug.</p>
<p>And only the 1st one could come even close to including mRNA as a vaccine with the use of 'synthetic constructs'.</p>

        <p>Well, they’ve already completed Phase 1, 2, and 3 Clinical trials. </p>
<p>The litigation protections are the same as those granted to manufacturers of ALL vaccines included in the childhood vaccination schedule in the US since 1987, and are the only reason pharmaceutical companies are willing to manufacture vaccines for nation/world-scale deployments. It should 100% be the responsibility of the GOVERNMENTS requesting massive vaccination campaigns to be liable for those campaigns. </p>
<p>All of which are beside the point as “vaccine” is a TYPE of medication and isn’t tied to any of those factors. It’s either a vaccine based on composition and mode of action or it isn’t.</p>

        <p>Except that is what a vaccine does.  This mRNA treatment does not do that.  And they do NOT do it for the Alpha variant.  People caught and spread it also but less so.  None of it has shown to be as effective as natural immunity.  There is still no studies of any strain spreading to people that have caught and recovered from COVID-19.  THAT would be the definition of a breakthrough event, not the tens of thousands of innoculated people catching it now.</p>

        <p>That COVID reinfection is a real possibility which needs to be considered.</p>
<p>“Clinicians should consider COVID reinfection as one of the differential diagnoses even if a patient had a history of past COVID-19 infection. If those who recover from mild COVID-19 have a short-term immunity, reinfections may become more common in the future and recovered individuals need to take all the same universal precautions (masking, distancing, sanitizing hands) recommended to susceptible individuals. Vaccination strategies will need to take into account the likelihood of antibody decay and possible susceptibility to reinfection. Surveillance to detect such reinfections, and studies aimed at understanding the immunological predictors of such reinfections would be crucial in preventing them and avoiding future waves of the pandemic.”</p>

        <p>Nope. I’m talking about the overall global Case Fatality Rate which has been quite stable at about 2.4%. 2.4% of ALL diagnosed COVID cases end in death. Sure, we can break it down further by age group and the percentages will change. One thing that won’t change is that, among ALL populations and age groups, the mortality rate from COVID is higher than that for vaccination. So, no matter your age or health, it is ALWAYS (barring legit contraindications) safer to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>You’re somewhat right. Since the vaccination campaign, we’ve dropped from 2.4%-1.8% in the US. That’s across the entire population. EVERY disease is riskier for people with comorbidities, but that doesn’t make them risk-free for those without. </p>
<p>Edit: Not to mention that more than half (probably closer to 75-80%) of the US population has issues which are comorbid with COVID.</p>

        <p>The definition of “statistical 0” is that there isn’t one because it’s not a real stats term.</p>
<p>Edit: The phrase you’re likely looking for is “statistically insignificant”. Which is an assertion you can’t make without a real statistical analysis of the data (which I can pretty much guarantee you haven’t done).</p>

        <p>Okay... what has that got to do with choosing not to take an experimental drug if the risk of dying without it is statistically insignificant?  I never claimed that taking the drug was a significant risk of death.</p>

        <p>Biden says he's not declaring a second lockdown over the Delta variant, which means, when translated from WH Orwellian doublespeak, that he will declare one in the near future over the Lambda or some other variant. </p>
<p>Also September is a crucial month for globalists, judging by the rapid acceleration of their "vaccine" mandate and "jab in every arm" campaign. Watch out.</p>

        <p>I have to wonder if the public knows/is told about gamma and epsilon yet. Delta's been a thing for months now and everyone's acting like it just got here and now poses the worst threat to the world. Meanwhile I'm reading articles like 'if we don't get everyone vaccinated, we might get strains in the future that can evade vaccines' while just kinda side-eying gamma and epsilon over there in the corner waiting for the news to report that they exist and have the magic power to evade our vaccines, so we need a new vaccine. I'm betting September the shot will be fully fda approved, opening the door for real mandate instead of the unofficial ones</p>

        <p>Even the CDC admits the vaccines are garbage and that vaxxed sheep are still superspreaders. This'll pave the way for endless booster shots and bigotry toward unvaxxed, since, according to the usurper-in-chief, the variants are supposedly occurring in the unvaccinated population. </p>
<p>FDA approval for the vaxx is coming, given they're little more than a criminal syndicate like the rest of the Biden administration. They're already talking about the feasibility of national mandates and that won't happen without it.</p>

Please by all means enlighten me how getting a vaccine is tyrannical? Let's leave the religion part out.. I mean the religious groups are the most likely to agree with you.

Regardless of how many times they are proven wrong, they just put there fingers in their ears "na na poo poo I can't hear you."..... But that was a serious question, how is a vaccine tyrannical?

        <p>Okay so there seems to be a pretty large disconnect between our knowledgebases. From my studies, a coronavirus is likely to be the cell death initiator function of apoptosis (cell death), responsible in part for destroying a damaged or dying cell so it can be removed by macrophages. So with this possibility in mind, using a PCR test which can find the virus in anyone (again, very likely if it is an immune function) is not a real indication of sourcing the disease, and could then be an indication of sleight of hand blame game, perpetrated by a very few people, almost all of which have to do with the Wuhan lab where the "original isolate" exists that we "test" everything against.</p>
<p>I point out tyranny and religion to pose that the last couple hundred years of "science" may as well be another religion in our hundreds of thousands of years of existence, occams razer and all that. A chemical injection being forced into the populace against their will and at the risk of removing their liberties if they dont, is indeed, tyranny. Medical industrial tyranny specifically.</p>
<p>No one so far has been able to prove this novel coronavirus is itself causing any disease. Finding it in a diseased person is a perfect example of correlation != causation. It's bunk science, we all know the science, we all know you can't use PCR to diagnose disease, we all know the medical industry is corrupted and the regulatory bodies likely captured by revolving door politics.</p>
<p>The only people who are sticking their fingers in their ears "la la la la" are the ones ignoring the thousands of years of exploitation and medical degeneracy and instead choosing to live in fear over something they themselves will NEVER emperically prove.</p>

        <p>Thanks I certainly understand and appreciate the dance of conflicting ideologies.</p>
<p>To your point, the question really becomes "who's benefiting from the vaccines", and the reality is there are BILLIONS of dollars being made off these injections right now. Regardless of how effective they might be, if the argument for them is that you have an invasive foreign invader in your body and the vaccine beats it, then fear/uncertainty/doubt becomes the primary motivating factor in receiving the injection. If you don't believe the "foreign body" is so foreign, it quickly falls apart and you can see very easily the tyrannical aspects moving into societies around the world.</p>
<p>The question further becomes, if this one is a fake vaccine or skewed data to push a product, what are the others good for? And the answer to that is a whole new rabbit hole of medical horseshit. I'm very much convinced at the end of my studies that asymptomatic spread is almost entirely made up, and possibly communicable diseases as a whole are now in question. Perhaps indeed every other "vaccine" is part and parcel of the same sleight of hand "science", but I hold out hope that I'm very much wrong, because the implications otherwise are very harrowing.</p>

        <p>The professionals across the floor unfortunately do not appear to have very much to gain from this, rather they are likely the "useful idiots" that help perpetrate the scam by diagnosing and using the tools they are told to use by their industry. Compartmentalization of knowledge is rampant in the medical industry. Only the ones who have a lot to gain, ie. the doctors on the front pages of news articles (The People's "Sexiest Man" lol) are the ones who really seem to be the spear point of the whole operation.</p>

<p>The constant shaming, badgering, and threats to people’s livelihoods and very ability to participate in public life, in conjunction with the state declaring people public enemies for choosing not to receive an experimental biotechnology, amounts to coercive force being used to infiltrate your very body. If you do not control the meat that constitutes your corporeal existence, you do not control anything, and you are a slave. This is the definition of tyranny</p>

        <p>The vaccine doesn’t control people. The corporo-academico-statist media juggernaut has used fear-based conditioning paradigms to radically alter and control the behavior of the citizenry and the very soul of humanity. It seeks to break the mass of humanity so that we the people submit to them them as rulers. The vaccine is being used as the mechanism to infiltrate the ultimate borders of individual sovereignty: your body itself. </p>
<p>Once they have gotten you to submit to an intervention you didn’t want on your body, they have broken you. Just like you break a horse by challenging its body until it lies down in submission.</p>

        <p>I don't have the vaccine and I have experienced non of these things.. and there are MANY vaccines that are already mandated for different jobs, going to school, traveling outside the country... I mean do you guys not work? Is it not tyrannical to force us to get a SS# than?.. why must we be told we have to go-to a Job everyday for most of our lives just to have basic nessesitys.. there are so many things in society that already do everything you've stated.. why do they need a new one.. and why is the phenomenon world wide and not just specific to countries who's governments already do this?.. again all I see is mental gymnastics.. do you not take any firm if medicine than?... With all the injustice pushed on the human race.. why is this the one you chose to stand your ground on?</p>

        <p>&rt;  Is it not tyrannical to force us to get a SS# than?</p>
<p>A tracking number issued by the state is tyranny yes. People pushed against it when it arose; it is remarkable how far the Overton window has shifted. You will not catch me being inconsistent. </p>
<p>&rt;why do they need a new one</p>
<p>It has been an engineered crisis of opportunity. The bulk of humanity has been so thoroughly interconnected via high speed internet and smart devices only for the past three or four years. They never could have orchestrated such a global crisis without being able to control most people’s consciousness simultaneously through their devices as is currently possible.  </p>
<p>&rt; why is the phenomenon world wide and not just specific to countries who's governments already do this?</p>
<p>Because actual power flows from meta-state agents whom most people have never heard of, to whom the political puppets that are the spokespeople for various states answer. </p>
<p>Basically man, I don’t care if you disagree with me. That’s fine. But if you remember one thing, my point is this whole saga has not been about helping the people. These are the same governments that starve children and bomb civilians for profit and run Guantanamo bay. </p>
<p>The whole saga has been a psychological operation engineered by the global elite to consolidate more power. Terror is the most effective means to control someone’s mind.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I believe we will have another lockdown I just hope the red states say no than all we will have to deal with are the businesses pushing this bs it will be a pain but it's better than getting hit by the two. This covid battle is truly our last stand or things will not go back to what they were they will get even darker. Stay aware stay safe question everything this is going to be rough.</p>

        <p>There being another lockdown or not now relies on the personal responsibility of people, i.e. are people getting vaccinated/wearing masks as per guidelines. </p>
<p>If there's another lockdown in your area it is virtually 100% the fault of the citizens not doing what their supposed to be doing. Like not getting the vaccine then ending up in hospital like what we're seeing in Conservative states.</p>

        <p>Maybe, but from what I gather I just can't agree with that sentiment when it comes to this "novel coronavirus". Just head on over to r/covidvaccinated to get a refresher on where we stand regarding the amount of "fuss" these injections are giving people. But then they tell us we could have covid and not even know? Lol I think I'll take my chances this time around.</p>

        <p>Not only is it natural selection, there’s also human selection going on. There’s too many people on this planet for the elites to continue feeling wealthy. They need you to be gone, because you are a wasteful eater of resources. Unfortunately, a large proportion of those of us who remain will be independent thinkers and strong willed fighters. It was nice briefly knowing about you.</p>

        <p>Fucking hell this makes my blood boil. I am so sorry to hear about your daughter. I am in the UK and suffered with pre-existing mental problems and I am not clever enough to find the words to convey how miserable all of the nonsensical lockdown rules we put up with made me feel.</p>
<p>Honestly everyone wants to say 'mental help this and mental health that' and sing Simone Biles praises, but in truth its fucking lip service and jack shit gets done. I had my counselling stopped because of the pandemic. NHS waiting list is over 2 years to access public funded local services and the private practice I had been visiting can't get me back in because of being inundated with new clients.</p>
<p>I am not a religious person, but I pray for your family my friend. Stay strong for her - I was lucky that my Mum was incredibly supportive throughout this. Its the only thing that kept me going.</p>
<p>Godspeed my friend.</p>

        <p>Your personal opinion and individuality does not matter to these people. It's the "collective" hive mind that counts. Fear of being an individual. Fear of expressing themselves and their own thoughts. Fear of not being normal. Fear fear fear. The air is thick with it. Why do these people get so angry? Fear and sadness turned inwards turns to anger. They see how they should be and others who contrast against how they behave and they see what's right and get angry. When sociopaths are around those who highlight and contrast their flaws, they get angry. These people are afraid and they turn to what's deemed as the social norm to be comfortable and go against everything thats right. Many of them had crab mentalities before all of this. Now it's gone to the extreme.</p>

        <p>That's the problem.. there is no room for <em>opinions</em> on this matter. If you wanna have an educated view sure go for it, at least have some kind of evidence to back up your view one way or the other. If you are leaving your health upto <em>opinion</em> you have more to worry about than getting a shot or not.</p>

        <p>So crazy. My aunt’s landlord has been appalled that she isn’t getting the shot and it was the exact same thing - first she was offering her $100 to get the shot, but when I talked to my aunt the other day she told me that she’s now offering her $1,000 to get the shot. This is her <em>landlord</em>! Not even a close friend or family! It’s just so astounding to me how obsessed these people are about what others do.</p>

        <p>Amazing how quickly people turn into zombies through MSM hypnosis. The vaxxed zombies are no different from the zombies in other totalitarian regimes, but instead of pushing race science and world revolution, they push those those retarded COVID fake injections. Tyranny and obedience to it really is in the DNA of most people, all one has to do is flick the switch.</p>

        <p>But why? Thats a bad deal cause if u end up ill then someone taking care of the bills only goes so far, you'd still be ill if its a chronic disease. As someone that has a chronic disease, trust me some of them are brutal and life ruining. All for a cold that has a tiny change of killing you?</p>

        <p>Coming to you all the way from Morocco. The situation is very similar here. My sister is getting the jab soon. A couple of my friends already did. These are people who used to say they won't get it. I already talked to my parents and I'm sure none of them will pester me to get it. Finally, the government here is surely going to make it hell for me if O don't get it. Well guess what? I'm not getting it. Life is too short of a test to get sucked into the hubris of some megalomaniacs running the world.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're dealing with this OP. Your sister sounds like mine. Haven't spoken to her in months now. I'm actually scared to tell her I'm finally pregnant after 3 years of trying because I don't think she will be happy for us at all. I feel like it will just give her more ammo :( she told me once before all this pandemic started that antivaxxers deserve to have their kids taken from them and it disturbs me to think my sister might go that far with me. I'm trying not to worry but honestly wondering if I should just keep the baby a secret from that side of my family for as long as possible. We live 15 hours away and I haven't seen them in 2 years now so it wont be hard to hide it. I'm just really fucking sad it's come to this.</p>

        <p>I can't tell you how to live your life, and you probably shouldn't take advice from people on reddit just out of principle, yet I feel like I have to share a bit of my life with you. If only to help you make peace with whatever decision you make.</p>
<p>A good portion of my in-laws disowned my wife because we are not the same religion. They would be kind to my face, but they turned their backs on their own family, because she fell in love with someone from the wrong religion. They have reached out over the years to try to see our children, but they will never be allowed to step foot on my property or in my home. They made this decision for me. They showed me their true colors.</p>
<p>Your sister has shown you her true colors. You are going to be a mother to a helpless, tiny human who will need your love and care to survive. Whatever decision you make, you have a duty to your unborn child to protect them, to care for them, to love them. Nothing else matters in the long run, not even you. When you become a parent, you are no longer just an individual, for better or for worse. You already know in your heart what the right decision is, you're only posting here for someone to talk you out of it, to show you something you might have missed. You didn't miss anything, you just know that it's a tough decision, one that I had to make to protect my family.</p>
<p>&rt;she told me once before all this pandemic started that antivaxxers deserve to have their kids taken from them and it disturbs me to think my sister might go that far with me.</p>
<p>Protect your child, that is your most important job as a parent. The only job that really matters when you're laying on your deathbed at the end of this journey we call life. We can't pick family, but we can break the cycle and be better than where we came from.</p>

        <p>If you want to go dark for the foreseeable future: shut down social media (or ar least limit who can view it), put passwords on your OB (sis has dob), no registry, password at the hospital and inquire about checking in anonymously, and you need to deal with inlaw posts too. There are lots of tips about this, these were just off the top ones. Congrats on your little one!</p>

        <p>Thank you! Thankfully she isnt on social media at all and hates the internet with a passion so it would be very easy to keep it from her. I also don't plan to share anything publically until the baby is safe and in my arms as we've had years of complications before this. I know nothing is guaranteed at this point. I just wish I could share it with her. She was my shoulder to cry on years ago when I wanted to start a family hut couldn't because I didn't have a steady job or a home and then again when we lost our first in 2019. I tried reaching out several times over the last year as I struggled with my infertility diagnosis and treatments but she slowly became obsessed with this pandemic and I couldn't talk to her anymore. I hate that I'm even considering keeping her in the dark but the last time we spoke, she was unhinged. It scared the shit out of me. My sister is gone.</p>

        <p>Im sorry you’re dealing with this OP. My family is the same but they’re all 50+ and sickly. I’ve decided I’m going to start asking them why they don’t tend to their pre existing conditions when they berate me about the vax. If your sister has an unhealthy habit I would start questioning her about it. </p>

        <p>If she or anyone else tries you again you can also say you’re waiting for the clinical trials to end, this usually shocks people because they think it’s approved already. And don’t forget, it’s a lot of us like you out here. We may not know each other but still, we are not alone in our feelings or experiences.</p>

        <p>My aunt, whose judgement and wisdom I wholly respect under usual circumstances, cancelled a visit to us when she learned I hadn’t had it. Seems we both think it doesn’t work if you extrapolate from that. </p>
<p>My other aunt now doesn’t want me to visit her, even though I did exactly that only a month or two ago. She was under the assumption that I hadn’t been offered the vaccine at that time, but didn’t seem to mind. Now she knows that I have been offered it and declined it, she’s in a right flap. It’s far more about being a good little citizen than common sense apparently. </p>
<p>Luckily I have finally found an ally in a chap from my cricket team. Up until now it’s just been you guys and people I’ve met at protests who have been reminding me I’m not insane. Maybe I can talk him into joining me in some direct action.</p>

        <p>This narrative wasn't meant to last. The cyber attack narrative will be the next one and they're preparing for that. Even the National Guard held a cyber attack simulation in the beginning of July and of course there was the Colonial Pipeline shutdown which I think was to test how people reacted. </p>
<p>The pipeline test was a wild success. People were scared and acting irrationally. That's exactly what they want because then they can present an extreme solution and the general public will accept it. If people were calm and dealt with the situation in a rational manner then it would be much harder to control them.</p>
<p>Covid will disappear because shutting down power, internet, and cell services for a couple of weeks will make people forget everything about the fraudulent data and everything else that was wrong with the lockdowns, mandates, and vaccines. The lack of Covid news will be attributed to high vaccine rates or the next wave of lockdowns.</p>
<p>In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if they brought back lockdowns to isolate people from their coworkers, friends, and family then start the cyber attack that will disable internet and cell services. With the exception of neighbors, there would be no way to contact people outside of your households and the government will be your only source of info.</p>

Also, after they start to realize the err of their ways, I know for me the struggle will be to not say I told you so. That’ll be the time to come together and heal.</p>

        <p>You're no longer talking to your sister dude. You're talking to the narrative, wearing a figurative 'mask' which looks outwardly like your sister.</p>
<p>It's happened with several people that I know (unfortunately including family members) - they've been absorbed into the group-think and are no longer independent actors. The narrative pushes the idea that thinking differently is in itself a vice, this is its' mode of self-perpetuation.</p>

        <p>Listen, this is a depopulation agenda. Why did you get depressed and suicidal in the first place? Because this world sucked ass. I was also a lot of times pretty depressed. When I switched living to another continent with another culture, I felt the most alive I couldve ever been. I had a lot of friends, everyone liked me, I had relationships. My life was completely upside down, that ended when my visa status ended and I had to return to my country. </p>
<p>So Im back to the old shit where I grew up. All because of covid, and covid showed how stupid all of the people really are, it reflects the true soul of the society. This what made me depressed in the first place. Im looking forward to return to the country where I felt alive.</p>
<p>But this depopulation agenda is being made pretty obviously. Everyone with a little intelligence knows, that something is wrong. All the fundamentals are wrong and based on lies.</p>
<p>And they chose to target everyone equally. I think only those who have emphathy or social intelligence will stay alive and make it. The greedy short term bastards that rushed this vaccine, so they could go on their vacation or restaurants for example, are that target.</p>
<p>Those selfish greedy short term bastards have ruined our lives. They are everywhere, especially in the finance sector, that made our jobs and income miserable.</p>
<p>So wait it out, the world is going to be cleansed by these idiots. And depression will disappear.<br>
Cant be depressed with people with manners, brain and overall intelligence. </p>
<p>Hope that motivates you to keep on going. For me, it does.</p>

        <p>Absolutely bro. Where did you live? I've lived abroad in China and then in Taiwan when this shit all kicked off. Was actually a good place to be in Taiwan because no lockdowns. Glad I left now, well 1 because i got tired of the small bubble mentality there too, but 2 because they went full CCP lockdown mode revealing their true intent.</p>

        <p>It’s because people are scared. We’ve been bombarded with “COVID is going to murder everyone” propaganda for almost multiple years now. There’s a delta variant, oh no, now a delta plus, next it’ll be delta plus plus, omega lung destroyer triple plus 19 bullshit lmao.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, COVID has killed plenty of people, but this is just a test run for when the real pandemics hit after melting arctic ice frees prehistoric viruses. These next few decades will be shit for everyone. There is no light at the end of the tunnel here.</p>
<p>The government wants to see how high people will jump, if they can get someone to wear multiple masks and shut themselves inside for months in response to a disease with a 99.9% survival rate, imagine what people will do for one with a 75% survival rate. Or 25%. </p>

        <p>Unfortunately almost in same boat,  6 out of 8 of my family are vaccinated,  I told them not to do it but they did and think there safe.
My wife getting the vaccine and we disagree on 80% of the covid,lockdown etc..</p>
<p>It's sad time.. God forbid something happens to any of them , although if anything did they would blame covid ..</p>

        <p>Vaxxed are less likely to contract covid than unvaxxed, though. That's the key. They can def spread it, but if they are less likely to contract in the first place, then it happens less often.</p>

<p><strong>"And none is needed."</strong></p>
<p>You should've said that and ended it there. Don't get into debates with these people and start talking about survival rates or FDA approval or any of that. Make it clear that the issue is bodily autonomy. All other factors are irrelevant. This could be the most perfect shot on Earth, with 100% safety rating and zero risks and it would still be perfectly reasonable to not take it if you choose--for any reason. </p>
<p>Just remember getting into arguments like this is giving them a chance to wear you down emotionally and exhaust you. Don't give them that chance. Just say you're not doing it and then refuse to discuss.</p>

        <p>Mate, listen to this. The reason you are trying to convince them is because you feel that you need their permission and acceptance to not get the vaccine.<br>
This is also why your sister feels entitled to "give you permission", this is why you are defending your action and they are judging if your action is acceptable depending on your "reasons".  </p>
<p>The fact is that you do not need their permission or acceptance. You don't even need to give them 1 good reason. Its your free choice and you could do it because you think the moon is a vaccinating unicorn monster with a desire for revenge against you, because you looked at the moon wrong. Literally your reason doesn't matter and they are not entitled to even knowing your reasons. They are entitled to accepting your decision and thats it.  </p>
<p>You're allowed to say no and you don't have to explain or do anything else. It is your life. </p>
<p>They're not fascists. They're communists.<br>
Fascists were those that opposed the communists. Fascism is the cure to this authoritarian decease in society.</p>

        <p>Fascism isn't tyranny.<br>
Communists always do this. They want to infringe on your freedoms, and if you resist, they will claim that you are infringing on their freedoms.  </p>
<p>The idea that fascism is tyranny is communist propaganda.<br>
It's people like this that the communists are calling "fascists" and "tyranny": https://files.catbox.moe/c37ya0.MP4  </p>
<p>What you call liberty, what you call freedom, what you call resistance, is what communists call TYRANNY and OPPRESSION.  </p>
<p>Fascism IS freedom and liberty and resistance to communism. It is a populist ideology. Financial freedom from the capitalist bankers that control the money supply. Personal freedom from the communists.  </p>
<p>We have all been indoctrinated to think that fascism is bad, because we've been lied to by the same fucks that are propagating this current vaccine propaganda.<br>
Take a look at who owns google, youtube, cnn, nbc, npr, facebook, instagram, reddit etc.<br>
Take a look at Bidens administration &rt; early section. Take a look at Bidens childrens partners &rt; early section.<br>
They are liars. They have lied to us for so long and we are finally waking up to their lies.  </p>
<p>Freedom and liberty doesn't come without removing the communists from power.</p>

        <p>Savage video by Bolsonaro! Thanks for sharing that man. </p>
<p>I guess you'd have to define fascism and tell me in what case it's good to have that to take out communism.</p>
<p>I see them as equally despicable because in either case their is no individualism, freedom, etc.  They are both bullsh!t collectivist ideologies. Any moron that follows one will easily be tricked to follow the other bullsh!t one. From my view, only strong individual, free market, critical thinking individual philosophy can combat both those collectivist narrative bs.</p>

        <p>This is the way. At this point, neither side is going to change their minds. If people wanted to get vaccinated by now they would have. My father is brainwashed thinking I’m insane for refusing it. We don’t need to justify ourselves. Just like any other scientific experiment, participants have a right to decline. Normally, it would be respected to just say no because it’s our own personal decision.</p>

        <p>You’re wrong in saying they’re not fascists. Fascism is, by definition, the marriage of corporate and political power. The Heath industry has now merged with the military industrial complex.  The solution is not to give the State more power, but to ignore it’s claim to authority altogether.</p>

        <p>The solution is to remove the communists from power, to put them in jail, seize their assets, deport their asses, ban any communist company, burn the communist books, burn their propaganda, delete them from the internet.<br>
You do this through superior force &amp; military.  </p>
<p>"Ignoring" communists wont work. They'll knock on your door asking for papers, well-armed - and you'll have no one there to defend you. You either comply or your entire village is slaughtered. Communsits are cute like that.  </p>
<p>Reddit is a good example of everyone ignoring the communist admins. Making new subs and ignoring those in power doesn't work. Eventually, all dissident will be censored/quarenteened/banned/suspended (slaughtered IRL)  </p>
<p>How you fight back is by taking control of the military and removing the communists from all positions of power, cleaning the west of their kind.  </p>
<p>Ignoring their "claim to authority" (ie. their guns) doesn't work.</p>

        <p>When the time comes, you will have to pick a side in this conflict.  </p>
<p>One side wants to remove the communists from power and restore freedom. The other side wants to stay in power and increase their power and reduce your freedoms.  </p>
<p>You wont be allowed to "ignore their claim to authority" by either side. Because one side will hunt communist collaborators and the other side will be antifascists burning down buildings and anyone not bowing to their power.  </p>
<p>So you either take the jab or fight them. Your choice.</p>
<p>The jab is just the beginning. They're only getting started. Enjoy "ignoring their claim to authority" without a bank account, medical access, etc.</p>

        <p>Lol, you think so? Try only associating with whites. See how that "freedom of association" turns out.  </p>
<p>You'll have well-armed communist officials at your front door soon enough, because you don't have freedom of association.</p>

        <p>You keep moving the goal post. Do you agree that you don't have freedom of association now? Yes, okay. So what is your solution? How are you going to get freedom of association? Ignoring the communists wont change anything. The only thing it will do is to allow them to infringe on more of our freedoms.  </p>
<p>We have to fight back. You haven't looked into this subject enough. If you don't solve the JQ somehow, you can't have peace and freedom. Its that simple.  </p>
<p>You give them freedom in your society and they will use that freedom to infringe on others freedom and to infiltrate power structures to install communism. It is what they do.  </p>
<p>How will you prevent it? How will you fight? What are your solutions? If you think fascism is so bad, then lets hear your alternatives. Fact is you thought you had freedom of association, which you dont, you thought you could "ignore their claim of authority" which you can't. You don't have solutions because you are not well researched on this topic and you've been brainwashed to think "fascism = bad", literally by communist and antifascist propaganda, you know those who want to take away your freedoms...</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you see it that way, did you know national socialists had Africans, Asians and Arabs in their ranks? They didn't shun minorities. The usual natsoc would say, "Africa for the Africans, Asia for the Asians and Europe for Europeans."</p>
<p>Oh and Mussolini's fascism was all about the country, not the ethnicity. Or that's what they say. The problem is when people confuse the fascism, which is much earlier, to National Socialism, which boils down to what I've read before.</p>
<p>So it can be argued allied propaganda obfuscated much of the truth because it was necessary to portray a villain.</p>
<p>However that is, I'm all for unity and what I told you is what I had been informed on.</p>

        <p>You're sooooooo not alone.  Stick to your guns!  I know it's so hard.  I have a friend who tells me he assumes I am going to die of the terror virus.  That's rich coming from a guy who took two shots of AZ, had bad "side effects" both times and now suffers from RET (reduced effort tolerance) because he gets severe shortness of breath and chest pain, lasting HOURS, if he so much as sprints for ten seconds.  (after that, his symptoms began showing up while simply sitting on the couch) Also, he is having his hands and feet randomly swell up like balloons.  But he's fine with all that, even if it DID come from the vax, because he is "saving others" and "doing the right thing."  He also feels that I am selfish if I don't wear a mask because I am "obviously so much more contagious."</p>
<p>I also see "friends" posting on fb about how depressed and spent they are, just dealing with people who won't do the right thing and take the vax "to protect others."  *head explodes* Their circular logic makes so very, VERY little sense, and yet these people write 17 paragraphs about how hurt and crushed they are, how they have no empathy left, and how hypocritical these people are if they call themselves Christian and don't do what Jesus would have done (which is, of course, accept an experimental chemical concoction into his body which may or may not kill or maim him, to "protect others").  We are selfish, and these "friends" are just destroyed over it.  I have also seen the posts online literally everywhere calling for us to horribly die.  (but masks and vaxxes save lives!) (if it saves just one life.... protect the grandmas.... etc.)</p>
<p>Spoiler alert:  THERE IS NO REASONING WITH THIS MINDSET.  Their minds can not be changed.  Neither can ours, but at least we aren't being MILITANT about forcing this chemical cocktail on our friends and family, all we want is our autonomy.  Just hang in there, try to deflect when you can or walk away.  Don't waste effort on being upset.  Know you're not alone.</p>
<p>Oh, and I don't know a single person who died from the "virus."  But I know several people who did die right after their vaxxes, my friend above that I actively worry about daily now, and one who was super fit and healthy (mountain climber, marathon runner) who ended up on life support and ultimately got a double lung transplant... thanks Pfizer!</p>

        <p>Don't lose hope!  Honestly, it sounds to me like the person she's really angry at is herself, for believing the BS,  which she's now realizing is BS.</p>
<p>However, your primary concern should be YOUR physical and mental health.  As much as possible, you should try to LIVE YOUR LIFE and surround yourself with people who RESPECT YOUR DECISIONS. I know how difficult this can be, especially when you're younger and more dependent on family, but I can guarantee you: learning to set boundaries and stand firm will benefit for you whole life.  So get off the internet and live your life!</p>

        <p>The mental gymnastics some use to justify it being an okay choice are mind boggling. Getting it to protect yourself and others, and not that it doesn’t offer that protection from the virus, and the ability to TRANSMIT IT and the fact you have the same amount of virus as an unvaccinated person if you get it, is completely different. Then they say oh well, i got it for this reason??? I’m gonna be honest, my parents seem like NPCs at this point especially my Dad who knows what’s going on but says it’s easier to go with the flow. Man, that view must be soul crushing.</p>

        <p>Well, I would just like you to know I've read your posts over the last year or so and really appreciate them and you.</p>
<p>I refuse to go through the motions anymore with people. I reached the point where I simply set boundaries to family and people I care about. "I understand you're talking to me about this because you care about my well-being and I appreciate that. I really do. But you're not going to change my mind about this topic. I've read the studies. I've read the papers. I've read the data. We simply disagree and your continued insistence on picking this fight with me is damaging our relationship. Do not bring it up with me again."</p>
<p>I like to argue and can discuss whatever topic, especially this one, until the end of time. The problem is some of the people I talk to about this simply do not know what they're talking about. They're parroting talking-points at you. I have no interest in spending more than a couple minutes responding to parroted talking points and low-info people.</p>

        <p>Same for me. I’ve been depressed for so long. My family hasn’t been vaccinated but they all live hours away from me so there’s not much support. I live in Seattle so you can imagine what I’m surrounded by. I’m so tired of living like this. I’m self employed so there is no chance of my job mandating it but living here surrounded by brain dead liberals who continue to vote in these activist politicians that even in better times keep letting the homeless commit crimes and destroy the city. I’ve also had the intrusive thoughts. I don’t see an end to this, especially around here. I can’t just leave. I built my business here and if I go anywhere I’ll have zero income while I try rebuilding. All I can do is try to keep going. Another lockdown on the horizon is like impending doom. I feel like I’m at the bottom of the Titanic while the water is rushing in just hoping it’ll stop. I hate this.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you’re going through all of this. I feel you. I’ve had suicidal thoughts too. Like, I don’t want to wake up when I go to bed type of thoughts. But I take care of elderly parents, and so I can’t die now. My parents &amp; I will never take these death-shots. I feel depressed, but this subreddit has saved my sanity from deteriorating further. Truth be told, I always look forward to your posts. You give me strength because I feel the passion, anger, and energy in your posts. You give many of us strength, and I look up to you. You have a powerful sharp mind because you articulate how I feel but ten times better. I’m not very articulate with my words but your posts are written very well, and help me formulate how I battle those who are mean or judgmental towards my anti-covid-vax stance. Keep posting brother! ✊🔥</p>

        <p>It's as if they literally are incapable of comprehending an alternate viewpoint to the narrative. They are brainwashed beyond belief.</p>
<p>My vaccinated mother has been experiencing severe mood swings since the Moderna vaccine which is something I've seen reported a lot on r/covidvaccinated (which isn't even an anti-vaccine subreddit, just people discussing their experiences). When I mentioned this to her, she got super defensive and said "correlation doesn't equal causation" and insisted anything negative people said was related to the vaccine probably was not. A reasonable person who is confident in their viewpoint should still be able to defend their stance without denying any and all points against it</p>

        <p>When someone asks me if I'm vaccinated I just say "yeah," and move on. Not even lying. I am vaccinated... against measles and like ten other things. This is the quickest way to get them to shut up. I could go on a tirade about it, but no one who is nosy enough to ask is going to be convinced, so my goal is just to change the subject and live in peace.</p>

<p>Things will get better eventually...I'm getting pressured by my family about it suddenly too, despite an increase in demonstrable evidence that the vaccine isn't stopping the spread nor preventing sickness...that Massachusetts study is even skewed in the opposite direction (seeming to show vaccinated people more susceptible to this), I hope the reason for it being skewed that way is that people who were vaxxed thought they were protected and were therefore not taking the same precautions an un-vaxxed person might, but who knows?   </p>
<p>But anyway, yeah i'm right there with you. This situation is FUBAR and I *hate* the propagandists trying to recruit all of society to help them do their dirty work.</p>

        <p>I’m in the EXACT same situation. Family members are now actively refusing to see me because they’re apparently so “concerned for my well-being” that they believe that they could unwillingly transmit covid to me and I’d “end up in the hospital on a ventilator” (despite the fact that I’m a young healthy 20 year old guy with no underlying conditions) despite them all being fully vaccinated. They act like things like herd immunity don’t exist and they act like vaccines don’t work unless 100% of the population is vaccinated. If you ever need to rant or anything, feel free to shoot me a PM, I’m in the exact same situation and they’ve said all the same things to me, so I can definitely relate. My family has NEVER nagged and clawed at me about anything like this ever before. It’s honestly weird and creepy. They’ve always respected me and my decisions and the fact that they’re so neurotic about this just creeps me out and makes me not want much to do with them anymore because they refuse to accept my autonomy.</p>

I was in great shape and had a lot of momentum into martial arts then the school was forced to shut down and they moved to virtual classes and changed the curriculum to non contact which is completely bogus.

        <p>The thing is, they can say all they want but they really have no business doing so. You have one body in this lifetime and it's up for you to protect it as best as possible - or you (and only you) will have to endure the consequences if you're right and they're wrong. </p>
<p>I don't care how "rare" these side effects are - the people who have gotten these effects have destroyed their life from one moment to the next. If they could take back their injection knowing that they would suffer as they have - they would. No matter the peer pressure. </p>
<p>But you can't undo these effects - ever. And they live each day in the regret that they bowed to peer pressure and mob mentality when they should've stood up for themselves. They should've followed their gut instinct. Because no one from the mob is standing by them now that they're disabled and need someone to take care of them - or even <em>empathize</em> with them. </p>
<p>In fact, they go from hero to anti-vaxxer very quickly don't they? Just looked at double jabbed Eric Clapton as an example. He did his "part" and because he got injured and warned others he is now a pariah.</p>
<p>The only way to eliminate the chance of side effects is to not take this junk at all.</p>
<p>Jabbed or no jab - both parties are capable of spreading the virus onto others. I'd rather still be able to walk then if that's the case.</p>

        <p>Sorry you’re dealing with this. The frustrating part is it sounds like it’s not really coming from a place of concern but rather of authority but hopefully I’m wrong. I’m glad she is backing off but if she brings it up again, you should tell her that health is a complex issue and she should also be considering your mental health and respecting your personal  medical decisions. </p>
<p>On a personal note, this has been my experience:
My immediate family and MOST of my extended family (a couple dozen  aunts and uncles and 50+ cousins) have not gotten the shot. That includes a few nurses. They mostly all live in CA. My 90 year old grandma and several aunts and uncles and cousins all got COVID and were fine (cold and flu symptoms). I’m not saying COVID doesn’t kill people, but based on that information I’m pretty sure I would be fine so I decided not to get the shot. Plus I’m 31 and healthy and have already been dealing with a miscarriage and want to get pregnant again soon.</p>
<p>Most of my friends are not getting it. The ones who have gotten it mostly don’t care or ask me, except for 1-2 second tier friends that post negatively about covid “anti-vaxxers” on social media (I’ve had all my vaccines except for this one by the way, especially because I like to travel). </p>
<p>My husbands’ parents and sister got the shot and kept bringing it up to him and asking him to get it, which he finally did last week. His sister is now trying to send me info on why it’s safe and I politely told her thank you and that I would consider it.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who won’t let her mother see her kids because she won’t get the vaccine. She has tried to do everything to coerce her and this is the final attempt she has made… withholding the grandchildren. Before the vaccine, she forced her mom to quarantine and not leave the house AT ALL for 10 days in order to see her kids. Now it’s just out of the question since she didn’t get the vaccine so it’s basically a punishment.  </p>
<p>TLDR; luckily most people I know are minding their own business, most family hasn’t gotten the shot including several nurses, some friend and family acting crazy/coercing others to get the shot, my husband got the shot and I haven’t and we respect each other’s decision.</p>

        <p>&rt;you could spread it to others</p>
<p>Remind them over and over that the EUA says transmission reduction was not monitored. The vaccines are NOT approved to reduce transmission. Anyone telling you to take it so you don't spread the virus is telling you to take an investigative drug for an off-label use it wasn't authorized for.</p>

        <p>IWhat is the point of having the so called vaccines when they are proving no prevention against the virus, you might as well not bother and cut the risk of having side effects. I was under the presumption that vaccines give protection for at least a year but obviously this is not the case and you risk having a blood clot or worse. I am hearing more and more that those who have had the vaccines are having strange symptoms, i.e. worsening epilepsy and other undefined side effects.  if you are healthy, fit there is no need to get the experimental poison. Look what's happening with fully-vaccinated in Maine, more vaccinated getting DELTA than unvaccinated.  I'm seriously worried about my vaccinated family... experts are warning the varients will evade the vaccines.The virus mutates to get past the immune system as after vaccine one you don't have enough antibodies to kill it. Always the unvaccinated who get blamed though.  Listen to Geert Vanden Bosche on YouTube. </p>

        <p>If you're vaxxed, you can still get covid, but you are less likely to get it than if you were unvaxxed. If you do get unlucky enough to contract covid, your chances of having a really bad outcome (i.e. hospitalization or death) are also greatly reduced, close to zero. For example, in the Provincetown outbreak that the CDC reported last week, a lot of vaxxed people contracted covid, but no one died. If they had been unvaxxed, likely a lot of them would have had more severe outcomes.</p>

        <p>The good news is nobody vaxxed or unvaxxed died in Provincetown... but come this Fall, experts are already warning the vaccine will evade the Lambda varient.  And, What about people who have recovered from the virus and not been vaccinated and have natural immunity... they don't need to be vaccinated. The idea that the reduce effects of of the virus is totally due to a vaccination program alone is quite ridiculous .The information is being totally suppressed because there's no money for Big Pharma or Government. Perhaps more focus on health and wellness.  Overweight people have the most severe symptoms.   Vitamin D, Vitamin C, exercise are your best friends, along with a healhty diet of fruits and veggies.  In the Fall, you'll need a booster dose.  Triple doses of an experimental vaccine rushed through with emergency authorization and not FDA approved. I'm very worried about my fully-vaccinated family and friends.    </p>

<p>How the whole 🌍 can seemingly be outwitted by politicians &amp; Big Pharma is just BEYOND me. Big Pharma developed a "vaccine" against COVID-19, yet, ppl with the vaccine still get infected. Doooohhh.."be good 🐑🐑 and just get the damn 💉 ok????". Don't ask any questions, just obey ... OR ELSE. Also, please 😷 mask-up and LOCKDOWN, because you and/or others may still transmit COVID-19. </p>
<p>Before we do this...please sign your name here ______. "This vaccine is not approved by the Food &amp; Drug Administration....You are lawfully and willingly participating in a trial. We assume No Liability for any adverse effects, up to and including Death".
It's there in black and white.

<p>Fear is a powerful thing. It shuts down the brain completely. You're only working on instinct and emotions once it has taken over.<br>
And then there's the fact that people fold when someone who looks to hold a bit of authority tells them to do something (Milgram's experiment).</p>

        <p>I guess I should count my blessings. My family doesn't harass me about the vaccine. Had a few friends do it. I told them, naw. I'm in a low risk group and it's unnecessary. I don't wear my mask while they all did at the bowling alley. I said "why the hell should I wear it? No one is around and all of you are in your 20s. If you're worried about spreading it to your parents, then you should've stayed at home. We're all literally sharing a bowl of fries, you dopes." </p>
<p>I've started seeing a psychiatrist as well to simply talk through these issues along with a close friend of mine and my nephew both commiting suicide. With the lockdowns, it all became too much. So I'm with you there, bud. </p>

        <p>I never comment, but I just really want to send you a big huge hug, full of love. </p>
<p>My doctor is recommending I not get the Covid vaccine (yet, I am keeping an eye on novovax developments…) because I was paralyzed for 3 days (full body, couldn’t pick up the phone, came close to pissing the bed) after another vaccine which has similar ingredients (and we’re not just taking saline solution, but like REAL ingredients). </p>
<p>Two years after that I got an “incurable” auto immune diagnosis, although I’ve largely been able to put it into remission. Not sure if they’re related. No one can prove it or disprove it either way. </p>
<p>I am really depressed at how many friends and family still think I should get it (none of them are medical professionals BTW). It really makes me sad that they feel I should take this thing, that I feel, is a huge risk with my health (my doctor agrees it’s a risk for me, though I think he senses I might get it, and  he doesn’t want to alarm or scare me or put me into a state of extreme stress/fight/flight/fear…) </p>
<p>Oh, btw, I actually HAD Covid just last month.  Really angry how people don’t care about antibodies. Really angry at the bad vibes I got while ill with Covid, like people wished ill on me, for me to be taught a lesson. </p>
<p>Almost No one seems to be actually happy that I’m ok and well. (I took the BEST care of myself ever! And I have been much sicker and far closer to death 3-4 times prior in my life (all from illness, no injuries). </p>
<p>All is this 
is just basically to say 
you are not alone</p>
<p>Thank you 
You have made me feel less alone as well.</p>

        <p>Hang in there. I know those words don't mean much from a rando on the internet, but there's millions of people who feel exactly like you do and are going through similar bullshit. There's no easy way to argue with people on this issue, especially family. Many only ever hear news from MSM, and don't do their own research.

        <p>My family is definitely split in the middle... All of my distant family (living in other towns) have taken it - but (to their credit) they're "surface dwellers" (insomuch that they take things at face value and usually don't go digging on their own) and to ask them to question the officially-presented narrative would be like asking them see the tale of Cinderella as non-fiction... 🙃  </p>
<p>Thankfully, I live with family (blood family and chosen family) who <em>REFRAIN</em> from the insanity...  I'm grateful for my situation - but I know I'm a bit of a firebrand and probably push some of my family pretty hard... Some of them think things might eventually return to the actual normal, but I tend to lean pretty heavy on the side of: unless **<strong>WE</strong>** do something about **<strong>OUR OWN</strong>** lives, that anything presented to us that we join will be a pre-destined path created by the machinators who started this whole takeover... 😔  </p>
<p>I don't have any solutions yet (per se), but I do know for sure: the solution is **NOT** going to come from the government, or a celebrity, or anything outside of ourselves... 🤝  </p>
<p>As for the darker aspects: I've wrestled with depression and suicidal thoughts for years and years now - as early as childhood back in Jr. Highschool... I was able to manage things back then somewhat (w/o doctor interference), but I'd start to see patterns in society that showed me those in power were thieves, con-artists, and murderers... And **<strong>WE</strong>** all <em>worked</em> for them... 😱  </p>
<p>Makes it kind of hard to find a "normal job" (let alone a societal role) when one realizes that taxation is intellectual theft and most people volunteer to be stolen from... I've known I'm not the only one for awhile now - but for whatever reason, we've all been isolated from each other... and I'm starting to believe it was even for a good reason... 🤯  </p>
<p>My advice:<br>
Be strong - but also allow yourself vulnerability and rest! FREQUENTLY! 😴  </p>
<p>Also: I've somewhat <em>had</em> to turn to spiritually in order to find the strength and support I needed to simply get by day-to-day. I'm no Christian - or Pagan - or Satanist - or anything really definable TBH, but there **<strong>IS</strong>** some kind of unified field of lifeforce that **<strong>IS</strong>** you but also **<strong>IS</strong>** <em>more</em> than you! Turning within during the darkest moments (despite how scary it can be) is sometimes the **ONLY** way I've been able to get by... And when I simply sit with these painful and hopeless feelings/perceptions for a while and allow them to be (without trying to get rid of them), they pass... I cannot change anyone, and all I can do is live my life and be as genuine as possible... Whatever happens, I can live (and die) with my choices. And I continue on... 💪  </p>
<p>Also: we're meant to connect with others... If no-one in your local proximity can be a confidant you can vent to and ask support from, then turn online for that support (like here)... Though I <em>still</em> say you should attempt to find local support - because I guarantee THEY are looking for you just like YOU are looking for them! ...Even if the online support is enough, I still suggest trying to reach out locally - just as an extra option incase the internet gets "locked down" along with all the compliant one's sanity... 🤐</p>
<p>Stay safe and sane out there dude! 💞<br>
Be good to yourself - be respectful of others - and ALL that jabba jabba BS?<br>
Brush it off your shoulders! And... the more faith and certainty you have in your choice of refraining, the less others urging will bother you... You might even begin to find it funny! 🤣  </p>
<p>Hopefully 😅</p>

        <p>You’re not wrong in any sense but don’t cave to the pressure.  Many of us have family who tell us to educate ourselves as if we wouldn’t know how to do so without them mentioning it.  I would just say that regardless of that pressure you shouldn’t feel depressed or suicidal.  You still have the ability to feel any way you want and while none of this is desirable, we the resistance truly need you and every other skeptic like you.  Things are bound to get worse before they get better but we need every last one of us.  Our time is coming.  You are just as important as anyone else, we the skeptics don’t judge anyone along any lines, whether it be race, ethnicity, age or otherwise.  You are important and while we are not organized, depending on how things go that may change as I myself am tired of sitting back and taking it and beyond ready to fill the streets.  They won’t ever take us seriously without showing that we have numbers on our side.  Hang in there.  You’re important and we need you.</p>

        <p>Same here. I have not even been allowed to come inside the family home without a mask on (that privilege came when they got vaxxed ASAP) but even that is super restrictive—-social distancing, only the living room and bathroom… and this has been an unwavering policy even when cases where less than 0.1 per 100,000 in my county for weeks…</p>
<p>I’m already not allowed at any family gatherings/holidays like thanksgiving Xmas etc unless I am fully vaxxed by then—-
Oh but they plan on attending a wedding in Las Vegas for a family friend—-
Maybe they just hate me</p>

        <p>The thought process is, a cure is offered, we need to stop the pandemic, so take the cure. No thought at all is given to the facts that the proposed cure hasn't been thoroughly tested, doesn't work the way a vaccine is supposed to work, and there have been multiple thousands of adverse reactions </p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as "tunnel vision", and is quite well known. Also, the above reasoning is a great example of a non-sequitur.</p>

        <p>I am so glad that my own mother (49 years old) has a real conscious and knows that being bombarded everyday by people and news to take the "vaccine" is very suspicious. She made sure my family does not take this "vaccine" for our safety.</p>
<p>Its sad how so many people have been split into different hive minds and haven't realized it. Sure, you can tell a stranger that for their own good they should do as you say, but everybody has their own will and experiences that determine what is right for their bodies.</p>

        <p>The CDC, for their new mask guidelines are using a fuckin’ Indian study that has already been retracted. They also pointed to an outbreak in some beach in Michigan in which 800 people tested positive thereafter, while ZERO % of that group died. The study points out how the Pfizer vaccine is still 96% effective against the Delta variant when it comes to hospitalization, 88% effective against any symptoms, and 79% effective against infection at all.
So my question is where does this end? Because if you’re like the liberals in thinking the federal government is doing this because they care then you’re sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>The current direction the administration is going is directly opposite all available science on the issue to this point, because it seems to me they would love this to never end, because it gives them so much more control over everyones lives. They’re using it as a political ploy to polarize the voting body and line the pockets of pharmaceutical companies, and its working, for now. But Nobody seriously believes that zero covid is an actual attainable goal. Nobody in their right mind, anyway, believes that.</p>
<p>Even if everything I just said was wrong which it isn’t, at the end of the day it’s my body, my choice according to lefties. It’s a personal medical decision and its my prerogative, not yours, or anyone elses. Anyone can get the vaccine, I’m not posing a risk to anyone by avoiding it. And to disagree with that last sentence is to say the vaccine is ineffective.</p>
<p>There is NO transparency, there’s weak data. Why exactly are we supposed to trust these folks? Here’s where the libs would cry: “WE HAVE TO TRUST THE EXPERTS!! MORON” yea…. OR, we can check out the data they present and see if it’s weak or strong. Then from there we can look at what they’re recommending and see if it even remotely resembles sensible public policy.</p>

        <p>More people under 70 died from depression and suicide after the lockdowns than from covid.</p>
<p>Everything that happens now happens mostly to save a few years of very old or very overweight people. There are less people under 70 or not overweight who would have something to worry about covid that those who'd have their life and health destroyed by whatever the regime does to combat the virus.</p>
<p>The old people saved for a few years will die from the variants quickly enough, and in five years, they'd all be dying from old age anyway. </p>
<p>But the regime doesn't do it for health reasons. It has no noble motives, only sinister and evil reasons - the health aspect is just for theatrics.</p>

        <p>Totally relate to this. My family is up my ass about getting it. I haven’t spoken to my father in 3 months after he picked a fight with me about it. My mother finally stopped asking me to after I bombarded her with information about it. </p>
<p>Some people just can’t see the forest for the trees. Try not to let it get you down too much. Stay strong and stay healthy. </p>
<p>I’m also taking vitamin d3, zinc and magnesium everyday which is supposed to be great for fighting off covid. Definitely recommend this.</p>

Journalists are in the same business as drug pushers and big pharma: make people addicted on some shit. Journalists know: fear, hatred, sex are addictive so thats what they sell.</p>

        <p>The best response is silence. I know myself and how I would react, so my silence is for my family’s safety honestly. They think they know best. Let them keep thinking, but you don’t have to waste your precious energy arguing with foolishness. My mom texts me fear based news propaganda weekly and sometimes daily, trying to scare me ‘to death’ into taking the shot because young people have died. I delete the messages as spam and keep it moving. I will talk to my family about anything else under the sun, but I WILL NOT engage in a futile argument about vaccines and what I decide to do with the body God gave me.</p>
<p>Also, I can relate to gut-wrenching emotional pain during the pandemic. Dealing with a breakup after 8 years of being together and balling my eyes out locked in the media room from sun up to sun down on a weekly basis. I’m with you; the mental/emotional strain was the worst part of the pandemic for me. I’ve since healed and am in a much better spot mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. and emotionally. I believe you will grow from this and be in a much better space as well, if you haven’t already reached that point. If you’re at all interested, The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle was life changing for me in learning how to stop giving a f$&amp;!.</p>

        <p>My friend got vaccinated and got cardiac arrest after. I'm dead ass serious,  he's 20 , fit and healthy dosnt smoke or do drugs , now he's on heart medication &amp; isn't "allowed" too take his second jab. Out of the 4 people in my friend group that got covid, 2 of them did cocaine and mushrooms the entire time and got over it in 3 days like it was nothing. Then the other 2 got over it in about the same time and were out drinking like a week after words completely fine. Yeah it's not worth getting a fucking experimental vaccine over a rebranded cold that will most likely do nothing too you if your healthy.</p>

        <p>How do you all feel about having vaccinated guests stay at your house for a few days? I'm concerned because of the shedding/transmission and whatever it is that makes unvaxed sick lingering in my home. I can't believe we have gotten to this point.</p>

        <p>I want to commend you for being such a strong independent and critical thinker. You are clearly not influenced by anything other than wisdom, logic, and facts. Bravo!</p>
<p>It really is our best and brightest who are so pioneering and passionate in their resistance of the mainstream cabal. I really can't wait to see the utopian freedom of the society you all create for us once the sheeple all die off from the 5g vaxx and the aids in the water and the chem trails in the air and the pedophiles in the pizza parlors.  </p>
<p>But in all seriousness, you really should be disappointed with your family- just not for the reasons you think. They clearly let you down somewhere, or at least neglected you to the point where you trust FaCtS on the internet more than your sensible flesh and blood nuclear unit. </p>
<p>Please, just go to your doctor and ask if s/he thinks you should get the vaccine. If you disagree with your doctor because of the internet conspiracies- then just forego all medical science. Really. Don't take Tylenol when you get a headache- big pharma probably gave you that headache so you'd buy their meds. Don't go to the ER when you get in an accident- those doctors are vaxxed and might spread their 5g hivemind infection to you. You are clearly smarter than all of them and don't need their help anyway.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish you all the best, but I do hope you come to your senses for your sake and for the sake of your family.</p>

<p>They're right though. Research is looking at data, not anecdotes. More than 4 Billion Pfizer shots have been given worldwide. You will never in your lifetime be able to watch enough anecdotes to get a sense of how common or rare those terrible reactions are.</p>

        <p>If you detect a whiff of frantic desperation in the appeal of family, friends or loved ones count it up to the known change in type D . It has 1000 times the viral load that prompted your loved ones to get vaccinated. If you fail to get vaccine protection at this point after having it available some will think of you as careless about the health of everyone around you as well as yourself. That may turn out to be as difficult to bear as the long haul consequences that will come with type D.</p>

        <p>Hey OP, I’m sorry your feeling this way, and I hope it gets better. I know what it’s like to have a crazy annoying family and I’ve been depressed too. I’m vaccinated but I wanted to reach out instead of being confrontational. Good luck and please don’t kill yourself, you are worth more than that. It doesn’t matter what you believe.

        <p>This has literally been my life with my family and friends this year. It’s hard to stay sane when ppl you once considered smart and levelheaded accept, justify, and fight for complete lunacy. </p>
<p>My plan is to limit my time with them until this blows over (if it ever does). I also want to limit my time around them because I don’t want to be the scapegoat once of them becomes a “breakthrough case.”</p>

        <p>This has been hard on everyone, some worse than others but everyone struggles with their own demons. Your family obviously cares enough about you to not want to see you get sick. I'm not trying to make excuses for them but sometimes the signs of depression are hard to spot. I never had depression or anxiety before all this but with all the uncertainty around my health (not just covid) and my job and my future in general, I'd be lying if I didn't say I at least entertained the idea of ending it. But not a single person in my life knows that. 
I had covid and I got the vaccine, lets just get that part out of the way. I know there will be people here who will say that I'm some boot licking sheep for that alone. But I don't think anyone should be forced to get the vaccine, however places and businesses that are starting to require them... well thats their choice to make. Universities/school and hospitals have had those kind of requirements for a long time, its nothing new. Some companies can't afford to let half their workforce to get sick at a time but if anyone is so dead set against getting the shot then they can let them go, they can fire anyone for anything anytime if they want to. You can choose to participate with those places or not but you shouldn't have Uncle Sam coming down and stabbing you with a needle against your will. 
This virus does have a 99.9% survival rate thats true but .09% of Americans population alone is something like 29,000,000 people. And thats just surviving, many many more have long term side effects from the virus. But you have something like a .00012% of having a bad reaction to the vaccine, so you're about 750x's more likely to die from covid than to have even a bad reaction to the vaccine, to me thats simple math.
But look, I'm not here to change your mind, only offer my perspective. I don't know you but it seems like your family cares about you and that is more than a lot of people have. Also when it comes to medical advice, talk to your doctor. Don't take advice from me or any other random person on the internet. But I do hope this helps or at least gives you a different perspective to consider. Stay safe and stay healthy</p>

        <p>Here is where it was. People like me who give a fuck about normal life and people like you who want to live a normal life absent of obscene fear and control. </p>
<p>I’m sorry your family fell into the psychosis. If they are worth it keep describing a normal world to them with love. </p>
<p>It’s not their fault. </p>
<p>As for you. You have to be strong now. That depression you felt and are feeling we are all feeling it. It’s almost hopeless. You see what the powers that be are doing and you feel like there is no escape. And there may not be. This may end in a fight. </p>
<p>So you have to be strong. We need you here. The easy way out is not something we should entertain. We may have to fight. And it is worth it.</p>

        <p>You’ve hit the nail on the head in every regard - know that you’re not alone. The “I’m concerned about you” narrative is the dumbest thing to me which makes no sense. Like, why? I’m in perfect health and take good care of my body and diet. I’m not worried about me. Were you worried about me before to catch a cold or the seasonal flu?! No. Because it’s not something someone in my age group with a good health record would die from. If anyone is worried here, it’s ME, because I’m worried about all my friends who’ll take an experimental medication that’s killing more and more people every day, without questioning what they’re putting in their bodies at all! Now THAT’s who we should be worried about! </p>
<p>We SHOULD be worried about all the job losses, depression, near-suicides, etc but media never talks about that these days, despite how “mental health” used to be its favourite topic pre-covid. Nor are they talking about how to actually stay healthy but that’s a whole other topic.</p>
<p>You’re right, reason and rationality have all completely been lost among the masses, and no matter what rational and scientific reasons you point out, it won’t matter. Reading your conversation was like reading the exact same conversation my friend had with his mom. Goes around in circles, she can’t follow his obvious logic, “we are concerned for you” bullshit. </p>
<p>Well y’all can shove your “concern” up yours and let me make my own medical decisions, thanks.</p>

        <p>With my family I had a dream about the vaccine months before it came out and in my dream God spoke to me and told me not to take the injection I was also trying to warn my family to not take it and I was running to them and did not get to them in time and then God said that they were damned to hell once they died in my dream.. in my dream they were still alive when I woke up but it was known in the dream that their souls were cursed. I told this to my family members two of them prior to the vaccines even coming out and the people in the dream that took the shot got the shot in real life. When I get asked about the vaccine I just say I had a dream where God told me not to take it and no one pressures me any further because they know I'll bring up the topic that in the dream God said you would be damned to hell if you took it.</p>

        <p>That is weird. Subliminal messages possibly. I have an image of myself getting the jab feeling how easy it would be to just comply even though I wouldn’t dream of really getting it. Already had covid so no need. But that image/feeling of complying is quite unnerving.</p>

<p>Did you get tested for covid too btw? You say you had it are you assuming you did or you got a brain poke to find out? If you did maybe they put something in you to make you have these thoughts easier and prime you. Its a long stretch I know</p>

        <p>No PCR test, probably just feeling the social pressure. It seems like the same feeling of just wearing a mask and then everyone is happy with you. But take it off and they definitely won’t be. The nice thing is that masks are optional again for now and no one is glaring at people not wearing them. Even though the majority are wearing them. Those near brain swabs are scary, no need to go that far up with testing.</p>
<p>I would never get the jab. I may get a T cell test one day.</p>

<p>Oh yeah I know how that feels kinda. I have a remote job and everyone is real nice, there's some people I would want to be friends with and it's kinda a milestone for my career where it feels like I'm actually making progress in life, but I know as soon as I reveal my politics and that I'm not/never getting the shot I'll be dead to them. Thankfully they haven't asked yet so the money flows.</p>

        <p>So hard they are being like that. Maybe you can say none of your business or just change the subject. I am worried about younger family members getting these injections and they definitely do not agree with me. One bit of good news, not for the vaccinated though, is that vaccinated people carry as much virus as non-vaccinated. So these jabs are not stopping the spread so there is no rationale to mandate them or get others to get it. And 74% of people infected in Massachusetts recently were double vaccinated.</p>

        <p>My entire family has gotten the jab. My sister for the longest time held out until last week. I was complete dumbfounded when the reasoning for h e getting was "I did my research and there's no reason I shouldn't get it now..."Now since I'm the only one I have basically been exiled from my family. I get bashed and questioned by my family not understanding my side for reasoning of not getting the jab. You're definitely not alone here and it's even happening to friend groups too. I have friend of friends who will not come over and hang out because of my status. it's baffling and honestly just downright sad people are this controlled and cannot see any other side of the story except the msm. The division has been happening and it will continue to. Hang in there!</p>

        <p>I recently retired from running a large pathogen, biowarfare, and chem warfare countermeasures research lab. Essentially we tried to develop treatments for really rare but really bad things. I have intimate knowledge of germs. </p>
<p>It’s very difficult to get an accurate picture of what’s going on because, rather than learning these incredibly complex subjects in a structured way starting from the basics and moving on to advanced topics, people are only getting glimpses of information, unassisted, and coming to their own conclusions. </p>
<p>Let me start by saying thats it’s almost impossible to get the information you need. It’s a signal to noise problem. That’s why we have physicians and pilots and astronauts. Because this shit is hard, it’s NOT intuitive, and trying to figure it out on your own is not realistic. Some shitheads will react to this and say they learned on the Internet yada yada, but, like flying a passenger jet, it takes more than the internet.  So much more. </p>
<p>Here’s the solution: This, like seatbelts and cigarettes, is an odds game. Your doctor knows the odds, is absolutely not part of some pharmaceutical conspiracy (people who believe this are hopelessly stupid) and is just a person with a family doing their job the best they can. Go to your doctor and do what they tell you. They’ve don’t the math. </p>
<p>It’s ok to be afraid. I was very afraid working with those horrible things in my lab (I did the dangerous work myself and would not let my employees work with the bad stuff until it was rendered safe). I even have strange nerve damage from it as do the only two other people I know who did this work. But it’s ok. Me and my family got vaccinated (including my kids) the moment we could. We got on waiting lists for overflow. I know how this stuff works down to the atom (structural biologist) and I didn’t wait one second to get the shot. But I don’t know you so go talk to your doctor.</p>

        <p>This is capitalism, sir. Follow the money, find the motivation, cut through the bullshit. Another secret: when a problem offers up big-money solution, the incentive is to perpetuate the problem to produce a regular income stream.</p>

        <p>That is true only at the very top of the pyramid. Anyone you will encounter in healthcare or doing research does not give a damn and the overwhelming majority hates the capitalistic component. Capitalism has nothing to do with an individual decision point when seeking care.</p>

        <p>The vaccine works. The " bad reactions" are a fraction of a fraction chance to have one of the reactions to be hospitalized. Talking 1/100000 or even lower.</p>
<p>&rt;99.9% survival rate,</p>
<p>.1% of 360million americans is 3.6 millions people dead. Not to mention you can catch it multiple times. 
People in all age groups are at risk regardless of being a teen adult or healthy or not. Not personally knowing anyone who has died is more like saying i havent ever seen a gang memeber so they must not be real.....</p>
<p>&rt;how I can still get and spread the virus even if I'm "fully vaccinated".</p>
<p>Getting the virus while unvaccinated can be very severe while the vaccine can reduce your symptoms.  Vaccine will reduce it to kinda like taking some theraflu right when you start feeling under the weather to stop the flu from flooring you.</p>
<p>&rt;I've seen countless videos of people having terrible reactions ("that's not research!")</p>
<p>Its not.....those are individuals while we have reports from millions of people reporting thier symptoms.....the vocal minority. In this type of situation quantitative results are more valuable than qualitative.....</p>
<p>&rt;No one is thinking logically. Threads on the Coronavirus subreddit are filled with hateful fascists calling for our segregation and forced vaccination, and yet they still believe they're the fucking good guys.</p>
<p>I beg to disagree. It is logical. Do we not seperate criminals from the reat of the population.....pretty sure we have case law against running around spreading contagious and infectious diseases. Check the story of typhoid mary. </p>
<p>We also have vaccine records for most schools so kids dont spread around chickenpox. We submit our info to get a drivers license and dont complain about not being able to drive without it.</p>
<p>Im sorry you are having suicidal thoughts and that you dont feel heard. Your fear is real, and valid. But its foundation is misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>Nah you're the one that can't cope with the fact that people don't want an experimental shot with no long term studies and no liability, made by big pharma companies that have killed so many over the years with their other "FDA Approved" products. At the end of the day you can say what you want about the vaccine. If you believe it's great then fine. I hope it works out for you. But as far as trying to mandate others take it and banning unvaccinated from society, that's straight up fascism. No ifs ands or buts.</p>

<p>That also make asprin which reduces heart attacks, puts out the annual flu vaccine, puts out the chickepox vaccine and puts out insulin whats the issue?</p>

<p>No its actually not. Prioitizing public saftey is literally a goverments job......why do you think we cracked down so hard on looters after katrina. Somtimes the govt has to crackdown for public saftey. Was it tyranny when we decided to up tsa security after 9/11? 
You seem like the type to be concerned about election security whats the difference between mandating a voter id and a vaccine ID both require submitting yourself and your papers to the goverment for inspection.</p>

<p>No, I say you're a shill because all you did was repeat the same big pharma talking points that have no basis in reality. </p>
<p>&rt;Its not  experimental, it has an emergency fda approval. </p>
<p>It received EUA just a few short months after being developed. And emergency use literally means it hasn't ben fully tested yet. If it was, then it would have received full approval. But even with full approval, that doesn't guarantee safety.</p>

<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Powder. Pfizer's Chantix. These are both products that have been FDA approved and on the market for years. Took over a decade before it was realized that these products gave people cancer. But we should trust that these same companies with a very shady past will make these vaccines safe? And I have never heard one good argument about why these vaccine makers have full legal immunity and cannot be sued if someone is injured by the vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;No its actually not. Prioitizing public saftey is literally a goverments job......</p>
<p>The same government that bombs thousands of innocent people overseas? Yes they're soo altruistic and only care about doing the right thing. There is absolutely NO corruption in government. You are so naive.</p>

<p>&rt;Took over a decade</p>
<p>So tell me how many years did it take us to realize pewter had lead and probably should have food served on it? Or how about the use of radioactive isotopes in glass and dyes? Lead in paint? </p>
<p>&rt;EUA just a few short months after being developed. And emergency use literally means it hasn't ben fully tested yet</p>
<p>No, it means its been tested but hasnt had the long term studies reviewed and studied. Massive difference. Pfizer and moderna have over 70k VOLUNTEERS they test on.</p>
<p>&rt;should trust that these same companies with a very shady past will make these vaccines safe?</p>
<p>We trust asprin ib profin tylenol advil chickenpox vaccine tetanus vaccine theraflu Sudafed etc each and every day. Why not this?</p>
<p>&rt;And I have never heard one good argument about why these vaccine makers have full legal immunity and cannot be sued if someone is injured by the vaccine. </p>
<p>Because no company will want to be first to push out a vaccine we need rapidly if they can be bankrupt for doing as asked. Thats capitalism. If there too much risk or not enough money it wont get done. Kinda like world peace....theres less money in peace than in war. So the govt reduced the risk to increase incentive.</p>
<p>Naivete has nothing to do with reasonable and rationally considering the situation. Killing everyone off will not make them money. Killing off half the country will reduce profits. If our politicians are so corrupt and songreedy then reducing the number of people feeding thier pocket isnt in thier best interest.</p>

        <p>It's the other way round - those promoting the vaccines are the ones denying science - you have turned it into a religion and dismissed all the good reasons for declining the offer of these experimental vaccines.</p>
<p>When even the inventor of the MRNA technology himself has expressed concerns about unexpected effects, and called for a halt to these trials, I listen to him rather than listen to a sweary ignoramus on the internet.</p>

        <p>Damn y’all are fucking idiots. Every single person I know, family/friends have gotten the vaccine. No one got ill from it. Some felt sick the next day but felt better the day after. I know of several people who’ve gotten covid, most didn’t die but did get seriously sick, while others did in fact die. This is anecdotal but all the evidence/research points to what I’m saying. Y’all are fucking imbeciles.</p>

<p>Stop lying. 330,000,000 people in the country and 600,000 have died from COVID-19, with 80% of them being 65 years or older.</p>
<p>Most people don't even know one person that died of COVID-19, let alone multiple.</p>

        <p>You’re a fucking idiot. My best friends both parents died from covid. They were in their 60s but didn’t have any serious health conditions. The ones who didn’t die had an excruciating time while some didn’t. Why take the risk when you can just get the fucking vaccine like a normal smart person?</p>

Like, this guy at least acknowledges that over 600k died from it, but it's impossible that you knew two of them. What the fuck.</p>

        <p>It hasn't been proven save hence a lack of FDA approval and immunity against litigation.</p>
<p>It hasn't been proven effective hence you can still acquire and transmit the disease.  When they produce and approve an actual vaccine... I get it if Wahanic Plague is still a thing.</p>
<p>It has proven to be an effective prophylactic which can dealt with through a variety of supplements without getting a dose of an experimental drug.</p>

        <p>Is that a response made to elicit reasonable conversation?</p>
<p>So by that response the answer can be assumed that you don't know, or that you aware that there has never been a mRNA vaccine before now.  And there still is not.  There has been promising mRNA research and they have taken that research and created a billion guinea pigs.  Congratulations,  you are one of them.  It's not proven.  It's not a vaccine and it's disenguious for you to come here and try to convince others to become guinea pigs because you have gone all in on your echo chamber.</p>

        <p>First of all, I was being facetious. Second, that’s not representative of the delta variant and who knows what other variants to come. Thirdly, idiots like this who don’t get the vaccine because of bullshit reasons are just a breeding ground for the virus to mutate into something that could be much more deadly and not covered by the vaccine. Unbelievable how shortsighted and uneducated people are. The facts are out there but they choose to believe insane conspiracy theories or don’t want the gov’t to tell them what to do as they wear their government mandated seatbelt, carrying government mandated insurance, driving at the government mandated speed limit.

<p>Unfortunately, you don't seem to understand that you are working from the (poor) supposition that vaccinated people cannot:</p>
<p>A) Catch the virus and</p>
<p>B) Spread the virus</p>
<p>The only thing this "vaccine" does is reduce your changes of dying. That's it. Nothing more or nothing less. Since only people who were at real risk from this disease are in the over 65 crowd, they should be the only demographic anyone should be concerned about. On top of this, using a "vaccine" of this kind has to potential at this stage leaves the potential for the virus to mutate in an unnatural way that would leave the vaccinated more vulnerable in the future. That is, if you choose to believe some of the world's leading experts in the field that have expressed these concerns. A vaccine doesn't prevent mutations in any way.</p>
<p>I really doubt you have done even 1/10 of the reading and viewing that people in this sub tend to do. Because only a fool would sit here repeating this same drivel clueless idiots in the meant repeat for them, without having all the details - you know, not just the fact checks and the narrative from the media.</p>
<p>Seatbelts? Insurance?</p>
<p>I didn't realize those were comparable to irreversible experimental drugs. My mistake! That's totally convinced me now.</p>
<p>What are these insane conspiracy theories that you claim people here believe? I'd love to hear them.</p>

        <p>Before Delta, it was rare for people to actually get sick, much less carry the virus for transmission. The vaccine highly mitigates mutation and even then, the viral load is rarely if ever sufficient enough to pass on to others. Conspiracy theories? You must not read much online…the gov’t is microchipping people with the vaccine, the vaccine is what is killing everyone, not the virus (it’s a hoax!), 5G is the cause, it permanently alters your DNA…and many more. Take your pick.</p>

<p>You're saying it was rare for people to die in the first 9 months of this "pandemic"? What kind of nonsense is this?</p>
<p>There is no evidence that vaccines mitigate mutations.</p>
<p>The viral load implications would be the same for vaccinated vs unvaccinated in terms of transmission. If you have enough load to transmit, it doesn't matter whether or not the receiver is vaccinated.</p>

<p>No on here believes this nonsense. Just because you read some bullshit online doesn't mean you can come in here suggesting that we all believe this.</p>
<p>Seriously, it's depressing how incredibly uninformed you are. Embarrassing really.</p>

        <p>Those who are vaccinated but immunocompromised are at risk of adverse effects of covid infection. The immunocompromised include cancer patients and people who have had organ transplants; they often have to take meds that suppress their immune system. In the U.S., the immunocompromised make up about 4-5% of the population, which translates to millions of people. </p>
<p>Choosing not to get vaccinated in this way affects people who have made the choice to get vaccinated. Being unvaxxed makes you more likely than a vaxxed person to contract covid when exposed to it. The variant currently circulating, delta, is also more contagious than the previous ones. When vaccinated people contract covid now, and are either hospitalized or die because of it, it is often because they have another medical condition such as immunosuppression. If less covid was circulating, because more people were vaxxed, then that would reduce the chances that everyone, including the vaxxed/immunocomped, would contract it.</p>
<p>It is absolutely your choice to get vaccinated or not. But you should also understand how your choice affects the health of others. It is collective.</p>

        <p>We all accept that driving cars creates some risks but societally we have decided that we are ok with those risks. The way that we keep those risks in line is by creating certain safety precautions. We have speed limits, we put seat belts and airbags in cars (which weren't always a feature of cars, interestingly). We do this because we try to save as many lives as possible while also accepting the inherent risks of driving.</p>
<p>We have also accepted that covid will eventually become endemic, because it has spread so far, to so many people, the way the flu became endemic. However having a high death count, overwhelming hospitals, etc, is not a feature of covid that we need to keep. We can choose to keep the case counts down so  as to reduce the worst harms of covid-- preventable hospitalizations and deaths.</p>

        <p>It depends on the person's immune system and baseline health risk. For instance, a 20-year-old cancer patient who gets infected won't likely fare as well as a 20-year-old with no health conditions. Though there have been cases of seemingly healthy young people dying regardless. There's a lot still unknown about how covid affects us (see: long covid).</p>

        <p>You have a 99.9 percent chance of survival. There are people who have a higher chance of dying from the flu. Do we shut down the world every year for them? No, because it makes no sense. By your logic, we should ban cars. Because there are people who are more likely to die in a car accident, those with heart conditions and who are prone to seizures, we should just ban cars. What? You dont want to give up your car? How selfish of you, this is a moral question at this point. Obviously you don't care about human life if you dont want to ban cars, I cant believe how incredibly selfish you are.</p>

        <p>What? But so many lives would be saved by banning cars! These are preventable deaths! You obviously are just selfish if you don't want to ban cars!

        <p>Earlier in this thread I mentioned that covid will become endemic. But not as many people as are dying today need to die. In the same ways that we want to drive, and accept that some people will die because of it, we don't just take off all the guardrails and let people drive 100 mph drunk endangering everyone else. We take basic precautions to minimize the deaths in our society. "Risk reduction."</p>

        <p>Maybe we can have a world for unvaxxed people and a world for vaxxed people. Unvaxxed raves separate from the vaxxed raves, for ex. Vaxxed people very much want to go out in the world -- they just don't want to take on all the health risks, unnecessarily. And of course a lot of unvaxxed people will never want to get vaxxed.</p>

        <p>Yup, segregation, what a great and novel idea. Keeps the people separated by law, not by who they choose to associate with. It's amazing how willing you are to implement tyrannical ideas in the name of a virus with a 99.9 percent survival rate 🤭 I'm sure you feel very virtuous sitting in your home, while I'm out seeing people and hugging my friends and going to parties. 🤭🤭</p>

        <p>It's not a law or government mandate by any means. If anything, government at least in Florida has been ruling in favor of the unvaxxed. It is a business idea however.  in Florida, a lot of people wanted to go on cruises, but only on the condition that everyone there would be vaxxed. People who go on cruises tend to be older, and thus more at risk of severe complications of covid. But the governor effectively banned the cruise companies from running vaxxed ships. What the cruises could have done is run one cruise for the vaxxed people and another for the people who didn't want to do that. Then that pleases everyone.</p>

        <p>Your average flu shot has a laughable efficacy, but at least it's not gonna hurt you like this gene therapy may/probably will. </p>
<p>I'm just pointing out the rank hypocrisy in mentally damaging an entire population to the point of massive spikes in suicides to save people who otherwise were so fragile the AC unit kicking on at the wrong time would take them out. </p>

        <p>Some young people who are otherwise healthy have died from covid. It's not just elderly. We also don't know the long term risks of having had covid. Getting it could pose a ton of health effects years from now that we don't know about yet.</p>

        <p>Yes. Young people also die in car accidents and get struck by lightning. You've been emotionally manipulated by the media to take a rare occurrence of highly dubious veracity and extrapolate that into fear so pants shitting that you've willingly allowed yourself to be injected with god knows what by criminal corporations and have dispensed with what vestiges remained of our civil liberties. All for a virus with a 99.98% survival rate. </p>

        <p>If a healthy unvaccinated person gets covid, won't that innoculate them from catching or spreading it in the future, like a traditional vaccine is supposed to? The more unvaccinated that catch covid, the faster we will reach a true herd immunity which will protect those who are truly vulnerable and are not candidates for vaccination. The mrna shots do not stop transmission.</p>

        <p>When you catch covid, you don't know what will happen. Hopefully if you are healthy you will survive, but there is no guarantee, and you could potentially get long covid, which isn't well understood. In theory you <em>should</em> be protected from catching covid again for several months, but we don't know how long that immunity lasts, and there have been cases of people who survived covid catching it again.  I had a relative who got covid early in the pandemic, she got so sick she couldn't get out of bed for weeks, she had never been so sick in her life. She had other side effects of covid for awhile after too, didn't feel like herself for a long time. She was in her early 30s and otherwise fit and healthy so it was surprising. She decided to get vaccinated because she didn't want to go through that hell again.</p>
