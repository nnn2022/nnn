    <strong>What are some good points to bring out to my parents regarding the virus and it’s new variants?</strong>
    <p><p>Idk if this is the place for this but…</p>
<p>I’m 21yo and it’s tough being controlled by your parents at this age. I’m also Indian so it’s not very easy for us to not have our parents involved in our lives. </p>
<p>I want to pursue my dream of traveling the world and working from my laptop but my parents are going to give me a lot of backlash because of the virus. </p>
<p>I get it, they just want me to be safe Ik. But </p>
<p>What are some good logical points to bring out?</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry, but you are <em>not</em> controlled by your parents at 21 freaking years old! If you're still entirely dependent on them, they did <em>a very shitty job</em> and shouldn't allowed any more input. Fuck me, dude. <em>You're 21.</em> It's not gonna be fun or particularly comfortable at first, but your independence is literally the only thing that makes you an adult. Be a man. Stand up for yourself and <em>your</em> life. Don't shy away from your masculinity and power as an autonomous person! NO ONE has power over you. NO ONE controls you.</p>
<p>You have one and only one point to bring up: I'm an adult, I'm my own person, you don't get to make decisions for me.</p>

        <p>Vaxxed or not vaxxed? That will spoil your travel plans for the foreseeable future. USA or where? College? Studying what?</p>

        <p>I had one shot a few months ago but I didn’t go back for a second one. </p>
<p>I reallyyyy want to travel. Leaving home is all I’ve thought about the whole summer. I’m supposed to leave  end of august. I just feel like it’s my calling in life. </p>
<p>I got my associates degree in video editing since it’s a skill I’m decent at and believe I have further potential to develop it in the new social media era. </p>
<p>My parents really want me to get a 4 year degree rn and they won’t stop comparing me to their friends kids who are all being doctors or lawyers. Rn Ive been applying to get online jobs video editing part time that pay around $15-20/hr. I scored an interview for one but it’s not remote so I turned it down. Waiting to hear back from a few rn. </p>
<p>In the meantime I sports bet and don’t earn a whole lot but it’s enough to let me live in Peru with my buddy. He’s a more successful better than I am. </p>
<p>I want to vlog my travels and share them with everyone online. And no I’m not trying to be some other cliche youtuber like everyone else, I have a strategy and plan for my videos, what platforms they will be on, my upload rate, scripts ect. </p>
<p>The extra skills I learned at school have actually helped me a bit and I want to implement them this way.</p>

        <p>Oh geez. Where do I start. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regard the vaccine. If you don’t want it then go back to your doctor and say that you had an adverse reaction to the first shot and get that on record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im going to side with your parents but hear me out. Being 21 is too young to appreciate traveling the world. If they are paying for college plus room and board then tale advantage of that. If you are forced to live at home during college then yuck. </p>

<li>
<p>If you want to travel to some crazy places and have someone pay for it and carry a gun while you do it then do <a href="https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/career-match/support-logistics/creative/25v-combat-documentation.html">this</a></p>
