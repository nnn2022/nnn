    <strong>How the fuck is the "Great Reset" still considered a conspiracy theory?</strong>
    <p><p>The elites are VERY open with their plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>World Economic Forum website details a lot (Welcome to 2030, I own nothing, and I've never been happier). Now this clearly references Agenda 2030 (also called Agenda 21, meaning 21st century, not 2021 specifically, just to clear this up).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world economic forum has mentioned the Great Reset by name: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPYx12xJFUQ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event 201 "pandemic simulation", also connected to the World Economic Forum. Done in October 2019: https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite all the supposed rules (for even the vaccinated), the elites have broken their own rules in plain sight, just look at the G7 Summit or Matt Hancock in the UK, or some governors from the USA. They only "social distanced" when the camera was on. Does that not ring alarm bells if these are the same people hammering "stay home, save lives" down your throats for the last year? Remember the original scare was "climate change", so they needed a way to "lockdown", and covid provided the perfect excuse. it was a trojan horse for climate lockdowns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People think "The Great Reset" can't be global, yet world leaders meet up plenty of times, key word being <strong>WORLD</strong> leaders. If they've met up at that G7 summit, they could've easily conjured more plans behind the scenes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The Great Reset" has even been mentioned in mainstream media: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcAO4-o_4Ug</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What MORE do people need to wake up? Something is clearly brewing, and doomers are even saying "if the vaccine won't give us our lives back, then what will?" They even know something is wrong but can't connect the dots. Uh, have you considered the ENDGAME instead of only looking at the parts? They're all clearly leading to the Great Reset of 2030! </p>
<p>For people asking "why/who would they benefit from prolonging the hysteria", well this is your answer! The elites/the rich have profited TREMENDOUSLY from the Crisis, unlike you plebs still thinking its about "health"!</p></p>

        <p>Anti Great Reset, anti new world order, anti world economic forum group(Great Unplugging)</p>
<p>A group called the Great Unplugging created a great plan against the nwo. The founder is very aware of, davos, world economic forum and more.</p>
<p>The founder had a idea where we make our infrastructure by all of us donating infrastructure we desire and buy the products from our own infrastructure. Instead of relying and buying things that would support the big business that are part of the new world order. Like IPhones or more.</p>
<p>If you guys think this a controlled opposition or a honeypot trap. You guys can figure that out by going to our discord and ask us about it. Rather then say we are without any evidence to it. Also we don’t have a leader we have a founder. There is no big figure/leader type person. We are more of a people’s group with an idea.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to explain this fully but there’s a discord where you can talk to the owner about it. But there will be a website soon. We have created a alternate face book. All links below.</p>
<p>Ask any questions below I’ll try to answer too</p>

        <p>Honestly this is the most frustrating and infuriating part of life for me. They literally spell out every one of their plans, in plain sight and in detail and people still just can’t see it.</p>
<p>They are pretty much standing over them slapping their dicks on their heads and they deny there is even a dick there.</p>
<p>Completely delusional most of the population is. They honestly believe if they follow the stupid Covid rules things are going back to normal. But as you have beautifully pointed out there is an agenda playing out and the plans were layed out for this way back in the 90’s when the elites got together in plain sight and revealed their plan to the world. It was never a secret, it was never a conspiracy theory. But people want to keep their dumbass heads in the sand.</p>

        <p>You know, I (a vaccinated person) am pretty much willing to believe that the wealthy and well-connected are in the process of building a better world exclusively for themselves and would have no qualms leaving us all in the dust.  You know, like how they called us all "essential workers" and "heros", but then refused to grant hazard pay, health care, or raise our wages.  We are obviously all expendable to them, and they are fully prepared to let us all suffer, as long as enough of us are still around to deliver their packages, bag their groceries, and drive their ubers.</p>
<p>But what I don't understand is why wearing a mask (or other rules) is the thing that crosses the line and makes us all unthinking, subserviant slaves.  Why is this the hill that you are all, literally, dying on?  The science is sound, getting them is easy, and they don't harm you.  Yeah, it sucks and it's inconvenient, but dragging your feet and refusing to take it seriously just means the virus will spread more and, therefore, masks and lockdowns will be necessary for longer.</p>
<p>Do you think the lockdowns are an attempt to make us more subserviant?  Having a populace full of agitated people who believe that a pandemic is ravaging the country and that their government is powerless to stop it doesn't really make for a tame population.  It makes people angry, and more likely to rebel than if they could just go back to the life where they didn't have to worry about diseases and vaccines and politics everyday.</p>
<p>Case in point - the black lives matter protests over the summer of 2020 were the largest in US history.  People had less distractions, more time to learn about police brutality (which is something you should be concerned about if you honestly believe and authoritarian takeover is in progress), and more time to participate.  Despite the fact that a pandemic was ongoing - which most protestors believed in and took precautions for - they *still* protested what they saw as an abusive government.  If COVID is a hoax to make people more compliant and submissive, they're not doing a good job.</p>
<p>And if you think it's all a hoax so that the government or big pharma can put whatever they want into you... Well, it would have been a lot easier to just put those drugs in the city-controlled water supplies, or in the aspirin tablets that almost everyone takes anyway.  Why go through all the trouble to fake a pandemic and a vaccine and have people schedule an appointment to be brainwashed when they could do it faster, cheaper, and more effectively by just going through the same delivery routes that everyone already uses and trusts?</p>
<p>All this to say... I certainly believe that the elite and wealthy are a scourge that are intent on trampling us beneath their boots.  Or at the very least, are content to leave use fighting over scraps.  But all of this science denial and COVID conspiracy is a distraction to divide us.  And they're doing a good job of it - look at us, squabbling here even though we both agree on who the common enemy is.  Billionares made record profits during the pandemic while normal people struggled through lockdowns and disease - and we couldn't even get a hazard pay bonus for more than a few weeks in most places!</p>
<p>But the real magic of it is this: Despite the fact that we both agree that the rich elites are the problem, if <strong>I</strong> were to tell <strong>you</strong> that, and suggest maybe taxing them or redistributing wealth or really just doing anything at all to help balance the equation -- well, then most people in this subreddit would call me a socialist or a commie!  Because I... want to disrupt the global elite?  They have balanced the scales and turned us against each other almost perfectly.  </p>
<p>COVID is real, and unfortunately incompetent and corrupt governments in both China and the US simply let it get out of hand.  The vaccine is real too, but they had a perfect opportunity to weaponize our fears -- fears of disease, and fears of government overreach -- to make us fight each other instead of them.  Now we all hate each other and we can't even agree on a common set of facts anymore.  The one thing that gives me hope is that we all seem to agree on what the problem is.  I just wish we could agree on *where * and *who* those people are.</p>

        <p>It’s not so much the hill we are dying on and more the straw that broke the camels back. We have unwillingly traded many of our freedoms in the past and this is just going too far.</p>
<p>I also disagree that the science is sound. To that point I ask you this: how do you know? Are you an “expert” in these fields? There are studies out there about the dangers of mask use. What makes these any less credible?</p>
<p>You agree that there is a global elite, do you not think they have scientists in their ranks? In fact in Canada our NHS is actually considered a charity. Meaning they are kinda under the control of who donates the most money. Who do you think has that ability?</p>
<p>I also don’t believe they are trying to tame the public. I think they are trying to agitate so all this makes sense to me. They know our rebellion can only go so far and if we do it will only play into their hands and they can take more extreme measures, and justify stricter control measures on society.</p>
<p>You might want to do more research into these social movements, there is more than meets the eye. But you are correct that police brutality is an issue and should not be tolerated. But in order to rearrange society the old ways need to be tore down and that’s why things like BLM are happening. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Many within the movement are genuine and support a good cause but the leaders of these movements have other plans, and governments twists these messages and get what they want out of situations.</p>
<p>As for the idea of covid being a hoax to make us submissive I think you missed the point. It’s not to make us submissive, we already are that, it’s to justify the security measures and society controls that are coming in the future. The Digital Id, vaccine passports etc. Change is happening and that’s humanity’s biggest fear next to the unknown. They have taken a natural seasonal virus, rebranded it and sold us on it being super deadly (which even the science you say is sound is at odds with). Just imagine they took ANY other thing, like car accidents for example, and told you every single time they took a life. Just non stop for 2 years, every single day. We would have a driving epidemic. It’s as simple as that. Sure vaccines are real, they are flu shots and have been a concept people have accepted for years. They are just slightly different than the old ones that’s all. I’m not of the belief that the vaccine is going to kill us all. There has always been complications with vaccines and this is no different, except they are new and there seems to be more complications than usual. It’s also a billion dollar industry and they are going Jab happy. </p>
<p>I get in the end it seems we both want the same things and it is interesting you mention things like taxing the elite and redistribution of wealth. I see why people would think communism. That’s the way these ideas played out in the past. That’s also what it seems the push is in the US. BLM leaders are openly Marxists, and anyone who knows history knows what path these ideas took. I realize that capitalism has gigantic problems, but it’s never got as bad as we seen with Socialism and Communism in the past. To that end I don’t have a good answer for you. </p>
<p>We definitely have to stop fighting over the small details and take a good hard look at the enemy</p>

        <p>That was sort of me until the vaccine was forced on me or I lose my job, I still haven’t gotten it but I’ve been pulled in by my boss several times threatened, discriminates against and coerced. </p>
<p>I was sort of forced to back and study up on why exactly I wasn’t getting it, so I could have some Ammo to use when they asked why not.</p>
<p>But the more I looked the more I realised how much I didn’t want it.</p>
<p>That’s the fucked thing, it takes just 1 hour of research and you won’t get it</p>

        <p>Because anything that isn’t accepted by mainstream media is labeled as such. And the people who bring us the news are also the people who are behind the great reset. They know people wouldn’t be okay with these plans for the world so they have to implement it thru deceit and lying</p>

        <p>I dont think you do unless you have cashflow reserves to get by, or you sell prior to a crash, and buy a business that is auctioned off, that way you have cashflow to get going again.  For people who are workers or tied to a mortgage, think 2008, We are already seeing tenant delinquencies creep up this yr(covid lockdowns play a role in that)...  The biggest indicator that something is massively wrong is the average family debt being at an all-time high, even for the upper-middle class.  I guess to protect yourself from being in that situation is to not take on debt,  but you gotta pay bills so that's not always an option.</p>

        <p>Anti Great Reset, anti new world order, anti world economic forum group(Great Unplugging)</p>
<p>A group called the Great Unplugging created a great plan against the nwo. The founder is very aware of, davos, world economic forum and more. </p>
<p>The founder had a idea where we make our infrastructure by all of us donating infrastructure we desire and buy the products from our own infrastructure. Instead of relying and buying things that would support the big business that are part of the new world order. Like IPhones or more. </p>
<p>If you guys think this a controlled opposition or a honeypot trap. You guys can figure that out by going to our discord and ask us about it. Rather then say we are without any evidence to it. Also we don’t have a leader we have a founder. There is no big figure/leader type person. We are more of a people’s group with an idea.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to explain this fully but there’s a discord where you can talk to the owner about it. But there will be a website soon. We have created a alternate face book. All links below.</p>
