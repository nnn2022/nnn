        <p>&rt;There is a hypocrisy in the public narrative that is absolutely unbearable to say that your doing this to protect the old.</p>
<p>&rt;I would love to die in a state that gives me freedom than live this.</p>
<p>&rt;I have already outstayed my welcome by many years, and my life expectancy is probably not great but I would gladly exchange this for the lives and livelihoods and happiness of generation that come after me to live their lives as I have been.</p>

        <p>It amazes me how many people are ignorant to how the Holocaust happened... it wasn’t just like ‘Hitler said Jews bad’ then boom ‘gas showers and concentration camps’ it was much more subtle, with a slower build up! It was neighbours, moral busy bodies and curtain twitchers who were the arbiters and cause of the deaths... monetary incentives and commendations were given to children... yes literally fucking CHILDREN who outed Jewish families or those hiding them.</p>
<p>What the masked don’t realise is the events which led to the Holocaust are the same. The  ideology, tactics and utterances that drive their Covid narratives are the same ones the Nazis employed... anyone with half a brain cell can figure this out!</p>

        <p>Even the gas showers appears to be a made up story in order to cover the real causes of death, which is starvation and diseases (caused by disruptions in supply chains after allies bombings), war causalities (from when the allies bombed the camps) and most importantly, forced medical experiments.</p>
<p>As for the showers, switching between poisonous gas and water just isn't physically possible. These where among the first showers ever built, there was no power grid, central heating and other modern luxuries, they had diesel generators to pump water from a well or lake, burned wood or coal for heating and pipes that doesn't have a constant pressure of water which means air will leak in, of course if you've never seen a shower before and you hear a "psss" sound (from the air) before the water comes, when opening the valve of course you'll think it's gas.</p>
<p>But talking about this is illegal in Germany, and soon in many other places too. I wonder why, what are they hiding? It seems that the history is repeating itself, only this time it's worldwide and the forced vaccines are technically "voluntarily" so people can keep living in their own homes instead of being moved to camps, but the principle is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Looking at who's funded Hitler with loans and who's lending out money to globalists today (same people) one can't deny the plausibility that Nazigermany was just a test to see if that concept of population control was possible. Soviet was another test, which failed when the union fell. The war was also a great way to cover up and destroy all the evidence, particularly when the red army could walk in from the east then continue to operate the old Nazi camps for about 20 years after the war as a part of Gulag, all while destroying evidence.</p>

        <p>Wait, what? I always thought the showers were sort of a ruse. As in they were gas chambers set up to look like showers maybe... but that is a shocking revelation for me, the other causes of death though I understand, like you mentioned the disruption to supply chains causing disease and starvation... the shower thing though that’s crazy.</p>

        <p>It's what the elite want us to think, ironically many witnesses has mentioned this exact thing. "<em>First they turned on the gas, I though we were gonna die, then suddenly it changed to hot water</em>", can't remember who said it but that quote is from a survivor, if they where gassed they wouldn't be alive, so it does make sense.</p>
<p>I also don't see why the Nazis would fuck around and switch between deadly gas and hot water just "for fun", Nazis (or Germans in general) aren't exactly known to be funny or have that kind of humor. Plus that Cyklon-B mixed with water would just transform into a deadly liquid instead of a deadly gas, with the exact same end result.</p>
<p>It becomes even more obvious when visiting the camps, and thinking like a German engineer (efficiency). The structure of the buildings is basically that the train comes in with hundreds of people, the people are then walked into the first building, 4 at at time (as there are 4 gas chambers). They undress, then proceed while their clothes are put into the 2m² sized gas chambers for delousing.</p>
<p>They are then walked nude into another building where the showers are, shower rooms with a wooden door and glass windows should be mentioned, but we never get to see that in the pictures, they've made the photos darker on purpose. Once again, this is to delouse their bodies as they're coming directly from the ghetto and might have lice, which might be infected with Typhus. Once again it all ads up with the testimonies.</p>
<p>So what's the point of all this? well back then there was a Typhus pandemic and the Germans knew Typhus spread via lice, they also knew they needed prisoners to work and to do forced medical experiments on so they wanted to keep them healthy obviously. Kind of like the masks today, but these camps probably worked better, until a rat with Typhus infected lice found their way in, which was inevitable in the long term.</p>
<p>What's most scary about all this in relation to what's going on today we have the border crisis in the US, where herds of migrants who lost everything due to lack of tourism walking into the US after getting promised a $2000 one time payment, only to end up in a camp which they call "overflow facility". Massive tent camps and they're expanding them right now. Same in Europe, just as they tested back in 2015 and it doesn't work very well back then either.</p>
<p>Of course, even mentioning any of this to someone who's pro new normal and you'd get labeled both holocaust denier and racist. We live in a clown world 🤡</p>

        <p>It's a shame people don't listen to individuals like this. Or at least the people who really need to be listening. I spoke to a hundred year old woman recently through work and I asked her how she felt about this and she said that in her hundred years in this world this was the worst she's ever seen it. That people are lost and it's worse than wartime because at least during war you had your family and your friends. The way they are isolating people and trying to keep us apart is making this a lot worse and it's killing people. She said she prays a lot and she hopes that everyone gets to know God because that would help the world a lot right now. She thinks this was a big mistake.</p>

        <p>In the netherlands there are still people like this woman who remember the war well. When I was young my first job was cleaning for old people living independently but who were maybe not able to clean quite efficiently enough anymore. I worked for so many old people. I worked for one woman who lived in Friesland as a young girls and was forced to work and do laundry and clean and dance for the germans and stole soap from them and smuggled potatoes home in her skirts.</p>
<p>I worked for an old woman who had dementia of the kind that meant her short-term memory was crap ( If i left the room to wash our coffe cups and she heard me milling about int here she'd ask "shall we have coffee now?" and she had already forgotten we just finished it a minute ago) But she remembered the war in great detail and described how the hair was cut of young girls who had had relationships with germans after the war over. They were shaved almost bald as a badge of shame. </p>
<p>My own granddad who died only a little while back used to secretly transport jewish Dutch people on the back of his loading cart at night. And his wife, my granmother, who died May of last year, went out on her bicycle during the Hunger Winter to dig up bulbs to cook so she and her 9 brothers and sisters and  her parents did not starve. </p>
<p>Rotterdam, a city 20 minutes from my home was bombed to the ground almost. People lived in fear with the windows shut and blinded at night so the bomber planes couldnt see the citylights.  </p>
<p>Sure it was awful and they couldnt do just anything they liked, But still there was so much more they coúld do then that we cant do now. They went to church, they saw friends, they went to bars. And that was under the tight-fisted rule of the german wehrmacht or under a Dutch government that was in extreme fear of being overtaken by the german wehrmacht or SS. Under threat of war you can almost understand freedoms being take away and having to forcibly black out your windows so a bomb doesnt find the city and kill everyone.</p>
<p>I would argue it's a slightly different story livind under a (supposedly) "free democratic government that rules by the grace of the people" in fear of a disease that is hardly dangerous.</p>
<p>I wonder how all those people who lived through the war would feel if they lived now...</p>

<p>Many alive now have not known true deprivation.   We have no direct knowledge of 'war', or 'genocide' or 'fascism' or 'camps'.   And so we are close to repeating the same mistakes as those who lived through those things.  Few are left to warn us about being burned.</p>

<p>This is a great analogy for why it should never, ever, ever, be the role of government to "take care of us" or "provide" for us. We are all free individuals who learn by doing, making mistakes, and making improvements. We don't learn by government forcing "solutions" upon us to save us from harm (that they end up causing anyways).</p>
