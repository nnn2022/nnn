    <strong>Work experiences?</strong>
    <p><p>First, some background:</p>
<p>I live in Ontario, Canada and I work in a factory that employs roughly about 300-400 people. We operate on 3 shifts of 8 hours for 5 days of the week.</p>
<p>When it all began in March 2020, we had to wear a face mask and a face shield.  Near the end of May, my work offered everyone a spot in a vaccination clinic for the Covid19 vaccine with the incentive that after 3 weeks of being vaccinated, you could remove your face shield. I'll just say a good majority of people have done it. You can tell who has gotten it and who has not.</p>
<p>Fast forward to July 9th and my work has their second vaccination clinic for second doses and for anyone who wants a first. </p>
<p>Since a few days after that, I have been noticing differences. I see people screwing up more and doing questionable things when they should know better. I see some people don't have as much drive anymore. </p>
<p>When I am on the floor, I can hear the phone ring. This is pretty much always either someone from the other plant calling, or its someone calling in for whatever reason. Today I heard the phone ring 13 times in 5 hours. I was also informed the other day that we are averaging 10 call ins per shift per day.</p>
<p>Is anyone else seeing noticeable changes like this at work? Either subtle or obvious.</p></p>

        <p>The warehouse job I worked weekends at had a vaccine clinic during the weekend. It was early summer, so the hours were typically pretty short. However, after the first vaccine clinic, there was a noticeable increase in hours for no reason. I noticed some people were missing and put two and two together. I didn't hang around for the second vaccine clinic but I assume it was worse.</p>

        <p>It could be the vaccine or it could be that people are just extremely demoralized from all of this, drinking too much the night before coming to work, etc. or a combination of both.</p>

        <p>We have had over 10 new hires either no call/no show and long term employees just flat out quit. People definitely seem to have a bit of brain fog happening, as well. </p>
<p>Now, I accept that people could be quitting quicker and quicker due to exhausted, pandemic fatigue, etcâ€¦however, it is an incredibly interesting notice.</p>
