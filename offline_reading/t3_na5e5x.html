    <strong>Depopulation &amp; the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been struggling with this and which way it will go. We know “they” say the earth is overpopulated &amp; they back the vax. </p>
<p>Wouldn’t they want the obedient to be the ones who survive depopulation? I see reasons for both sides and am curious as to others thoughts specifically about this.</p></p>

        <p>Overpopulation is a totally ficitious concept, that you will know is BS once you drive through large countries: most of the world is totally empty. </p>
<p>Overpopulation is a concept, driven by artificially created scarcity, e.g. in food, water, air, materials, city space, in order to force agendas of the One World Government (United Nations) onto us, in order to tax us, keep prices high, and justify harsh strictening of freedoms. Overpopulation could easily be fixed by managing our resources better. The fact that the Netherlands, a tiny tiny country, is one of the world largest exporters in both vegetables and meat, should be telling enough.</p>
<p>That being said, the evil scum running this world would love to see us suffer and die off in droves, and there is ample predictions and clues that the vaccines are working to sterilize humanity to achieve this.</p>

<p>I watched an interesting lecture once upon a time. It changed the way I see the world, money, everything really...</p>
<p>The subject of the lecture was exponential growth. When 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 4, 8, 16 32 etc. etc.</p>
<p>Bacteria multiply this way, each cell divides in two - the numbers double. So we set up a thought experiment.</p>
<p>We put 1 bacteria in a bottle at 11am. The bacteria split in half / double in number every minute. We go away for an hour, and at 12:00 the bottle is completely full. No more space for any bacteria.</p>
<p>Then the speaker asks the audience some questions...</p>
<p>anyone want to have a go at answering?</p>
<p>Q1 - At what time is the bottle half full?</p>

        <p>There exists a class of people so high up in the castle you have never seen or heard of them. Those people in the castle don’t have a single care whether you obey or not. We are like ants to them. Pawns to be manipulated by fear. Toys to be destroyed. Undesirables to be exterminated. Billy Gates is just the face to the kinds of people looking go down from the castle. There is no limit to the amount of evil they can do to us. They act with impunity.</p>

        <p>They will certainly keep some of their pets alive, but it's like my friend with a fish tank.  He likes the fish well enough, but they will keep breeding.   Sometimes there are too many and he has to get rid of some of them.  He has no attachment to any specific fish.</p>
<p>To the elites, they would view the loyal flock like that.  It's easter dinner and someone needs to be the lamb roast.</p>

        <p>Global birth rates have been on a steady decline for decades.  I think this is more about control, like the way you control cattle. Control <em>how much</em> they populate, what they consume, how they think, how subservient they are, etc.</p>

        <p>I'm worried about this too and while it's true there's enough space for everyone to fit in some arbitrary area there are also limits to how much oil, fresh water, farm land, minerals, etc. is available. It's possible 'they' want to eliminate most of the people before civilization collapses from resource limits and maybe this is a way to do that. A lot of the c19 restrictions don't make sense and haven't been done before for prior virus outbreaks. A lot of them seem more geared to reducing waste such as eliminating tourism, switch to online school, wfh, ending nightlife, concerts, sports. closing borders. Our civilization is powered mostly by oil and production is declining since about 2018 so maybe 'they' decided it was time to manage the decline. I don't think they care about who is obedient or not, even the difficult people will fall inline once the trucks stop delivering food to stores and the power goes out.</p>

        <p>If you really want to know, the only ethnicity of people on the planet, historically, who don't resist slavery are Chinese, so the elites want to murder everyone except for 500 million Chinese to keep around as slave labor. The problem is, we humans have something called Free Will and we are obviously resisting, and the elites are losing badly. Keep in mind only 1 billion people even use the internet. 6/7ths of the entire planet are not on the internet chiming in. Among the people on the internet, almost all media is owned by 5 conglomerates, all elites, including Reddit which is owned by Condé Nast. Have you ever looked at their building in London? So, just understand that you're getting a very biased view when you go online, they are, 1. almost totally broke (assets frozen), 2. desperate, 3. much of what you see is theater or controlled opposition to wake up as many people as possible, via demonstrating what happens when you give your power away and just "trust the experts" to figure everything out. This is about waking up humanity for real, it's not a game. Many people don't wake up until they face a severe crisis which is why this is dragging on for so long.  4. parts of the world are still engaged in military operations which require the people to be out of the way, so keeping people locked down is part of a strategy to avoid counterattacks against the public, which removes leverage from the enemy. I know this doesn't make enduring this any easier, but you do have free will and immense power to choose, including the choice of what media to consume. you can read a great book. you can go for a walk and look at the beauty of nature, you can watch a sunrise and listen to the birds. you can smile at strangers. your thoughts, emotions and decisions have real power if you choose to take your power back. you can literally say aloud "I take all my power back."</p>
