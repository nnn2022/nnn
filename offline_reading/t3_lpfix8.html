        <p>How do you mean ? China did do a harsh lockdown to begin with but they aren’t testing anywhere near as many people per capita as the western countries are. So we can’t conclude their lockdown worked or that china has very little covid when it’s clear they stopped giving a fuck about testing.</p>
<p>If you check on Statista they aren’t even in the top 15 most tests per capita despite being the epicentre of the outbreak</p>

        <p>Of course. Nothing says "it is not serious" like:</p>
<p>- locking down a 3 (10) million people city completely in January 2021 and even <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3116597/coronavirus-china-raises-alarm-after-63-local-infections-found">writing about that in your own newspapers</a><br>
- producing a vaccine  in three different companies (SinoVac, SinoPharm, Cansino) and using it on your own people, army first  </p>
<p>That all sounds entirely harmless. Of course you'd vaccinate your own troops against sweaty feet. The cost in boots alone!</p>

        <p>People praise Belarus and North Korea for the same reasons, because they are "free" of masks and whatever. People on here state they want to move to those countries. Same goes for China. And Sweden, which is basically a globalist wetdream that ignorant people claim is a "right wing safe haven". I've become really frustrated with people in this sub, and their support of tyrannical countries that they believe are "free".</p>

        <p>The Japanese don't think so, that is why they wear masks. Compliance with such policies is much higher in Japan. See: common welfare.  </p>
<p>But let's assume you are right. Let's take <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/indicator-groups/indicator-group-details/GHO/healthy-life-expectancy-(hale)">HALE (healthy life expectancy)</a> as THE indicator of how good a country prevails:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan has combined HALE 74.09 at birth and 20.39 for 60 year olds in 2019</li>
<li>Case fatality rate 1.8%</li>
<li>Deaths per capita: 5.92</li>
<li>Singapur has HALE 73.55 / 19.95</li>
<li>CFR: 0.0</li>
<li>Death per capita: 0.51</li>
<li>South Corea has HALE 73.06 / 19.81</li>
<li>CFR: 1.8%</li>
<li>Death per capita: 3</li>
<li>Norway has HALE 71.36 / 18.46</li>
<li>CFR: 0.9%</li>
<li>Death per capita: 12</li>
<li>Israel has HALE 72.38 / 19.33</li>
<li>CFR: 0.7%</li>
<li>Death per capita: 63</li>
<li>Switzerland has HALE 72.52 / 19.52</li>
<li>CFR: 1.8%</li>
<li>Death per capita: 116</li>
</ul>
<p>Ooops. Seems the metric broke down. Such a healthy country, Switzerland (even if the obligatory health-insurance/health care there is as expensive as in the US). Of course I looked for Switzerland as counter-example, they lead the HALE/health index right after Japan, Singapore and Korea.  </p>
<p>As I'm a bit aware of the recent year as European (living 30km from the swiss border): they tried their own way, just like Sweden. Without masks. Curious. Very curious.</p>

        <p>Yup.  Follow some people who have fairly large followings on SM, live in NYC and post doomer stuff and wear two masks, that have now relocated to places like FL and CO mountains for the next couple months. Not saying it explicitly but their stories make it clear that a big reason was to be able to walk around outside maskless and be able to go out and do things, have more space.  And some are the ones who judged people for leaving NYC in the spring. Even they are tired of being in small apartments not able to get out much.</p>

        <p>Nobody likes lockdowns.  </p>
<p>That's a straw man some people like to peddle here (to themselves?)  </p>
<p>Feel normal, feel okay, feel good in your bubble, but don't fall for the idea that measures and policies against Covid19 are bad, malicious and/or intending to achieve some dark sinister goal because you don't like them. My 6 years old doesn't like to brush teeth and my neighbour doesn't like to wear a seatbelt. At least tooth decay and car accidents aren't infectious like Polio ... or Covid19.  </p>
<p>If some policies a dumb (like closing barbers with a well prepared hygienic concept) use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">Hanlons razor</a>.

        <p>I never said they were there to achieve some dark goal. I was just putting an idea out there, I suppose hopeful that it may be true for some. Also, some people do like lockdowns, for various reasons, but I agree it's not a majority. I hope that the restrictions haven't malicious intent, just politicians out of touch with the concerns of average citizens, but I think that they are hurtful nonetheless and a lot of people realise that. There are other things we can do to combat this problem, and I hope people are realising this. But I think that they should be consulting the public before making damaging rules in a lawful way, rather than us having to take legal action to stop them. However, we are here now so that's a good idea.</p>

<p>As we don't have a vaccination for all yet and we don't have treatments: no, we don't really have 'other things', else we'd have applied them somewhere over the world. Every country using 'other things' (like Sweden) failed to protect its citizens.<br>
We've been there for a similiar dangerous illness, Polio (95% asymptomatic carriers, 5% symptomatic, 0.1-1% death/paralysis):<br>

<p>We've been more lucky with Sars-Cov1. I'm a bit pessimistic given the facts of non-compliance framed as act of resistance for the greater good that we will ride out a more dangerous pandemic in the future. There will be one. There is always another illness jumping the species.</p>

<p>Yes, in fact, I do wear ATGATT, wear a seat-belt and wear a mask to lower my and others infection risk. Security blankets with a measurable effect are quite nice for adults. Try them sometimes. Beats 'bravery' all the time.</p>

        <p>Focused protection was discussed in Germany (Streeck) and discarded, because abvout 20%-30% of the population have relevant pre-existing conditions (namely cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and high obesity). It is not feasible with such a prevalence.</p>
<p>As I wrote elsewhere: Vitamin D deficiency correlates with death. The jury is out if supplementing really helps, removing confounding factors is difficult.It's not that our RKI and the US FDA/NIH and ... and ... aren't looking for any way to reduce the load. We still have 3000 Covid19 patient in ICU in Germany. In October we had: 300.</p>
<p>We know and have: vaccinations (not yet enough) and protection, like masks. It would be nice if we kept infections down because you can't simply let several millions of people be infected with a virus and not expect mutations that sidestep your current vaccine. I mean, that's what seems to happen and I really would have liked not to have this vaccination the next ten years until we eradicate the virus.But alas, we humans are stoopid. We eradicated smallpox, we even eradicated one wild strain of Polio but somehow we gave up on other infections, because they don't seem dangerous enough (see measles, planned eradication was 2010 in Europe and 2020 world wide ... so that would have been another illness/vaccine less).</p>

        <p>So the medical journals are 'shitty source'. Yeah. Of course. That's exactly why we use medicaments, because they fall from the heaven like manna.</p>
<p>Does the approach 'science gave me the medicine and told me the safe dosage and side effects using clinical trials but now the trials must be wrong' help at any point in scientific history? It reminds me a bit of the contortions to avoid relativistic physics, just because it was inconvenient.</p>
<p>&rt;Yet the only solution is a new vaccine huh? Interesting..  You really believe this?</p>
<p>I don't need to <em>believe</em> this, I can point you to sources telling you by how much severe/moderate symptomatic infection rate sinks after using the vaccines. That is what they determine in phase III trials, necessary for a vaccine to be authorized. I could also point you to the recent surveys in Israel by how much their new infections sink while our new infections in Germany stagnate.</p>

        <p>If it weren't for these evil megacorporations banning, censoring, and suppressing all dissident voices, we would dominate the front pages, hashtags, and algorithmically suggested video pages of every social media platform.</p>
<p>This is something the woke Reddit NPC lurking this sub should keep in mind: the only reason they feel like the majority is that they are useful idiots of the powers that be whose voices are artificially amplified while the voices of literally MILLIONS of people are banned, censored, and suppressed.</p>
<p>But in a way, the woke Reddit NPC are in a lose-lose position anyway. Because there are only two ways this whole thing can play out. EITHER the current ruling class wins absolutely and totally, and then they will eventually throw their useful idiots (=American/ized leftists and liberals) into the trashcan of history and oppress them like everyone else. Or the <em>real</em> #Resistance wins and will hold all these enemies of mankind accountable for their evil actions and deeds. No matter who wins, the woke Reddit NPC will eventually lose and either be thrown away by the ruling class whose useful idiots they currently are, or they will be held accountable by the actual "#Resistance"</p>

        <p>So megacorporations and authoritan states work hand in hand to censor the people in this group?<br>
Isn't it curious then, that Russia did the exact opposite until August? Russia told the whole world all the time, that Covid19 is harmless and if it isn't, it's under control in Russia. The western news (megacorporations) <a href="https://apnews.com/article/12c8f559a4ec43f72035e6d1ca58271a">doubted the numbers coming from Russia</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tziw5i3vy8">even compared the information with Tchernobyl</a>. A lot of Germans doubting the need for measures against Covid19 relied on Putin (see Querdenken).  </p>
<p>But then they changed tune suddenly. Tatiana Golikova admitted in October, <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4975">that Russia had understated the numbers</a> and measures taken. They announced their own vaccine in August (Phase III trial published 2/2/2021), trying to upstage others.  </p>
<p>So. What happened here? Did the megacorporations force Russia to abandon the truth? Or, using a bit of Occam: was the pandemic already quite bad in Russia too, regardless what people want/wanted to be true?</p>

        <p>Did you seriously just say you don't see large corporations in Russia and CHINA?! Sure, they have more government intervention than we do, but neither has been legitimately communist for a while now. China in particular has so many large corporations it's insane, have you not noticed "made in china" printed on every 2nd thing? Have you just not heard the news for 30 or 40 years? At least you're correct about cuba......</p>

        <p>I seriously say to you that large corporations in China and Russia have not much clout, can't be 'evil megacorporations', which is the point here.</p>

<p>Please don't forget the not-quite-socialist-anymore Cuba. Here it is, admitting freely to have a pandemic and closing it's airports as of April, restricting much needed revenue from tourism, having a lot of tests and mandatory face masks. Evil megacorp hiding the truth about being able to adress the pandemic like the common flu or what?  </p>
<p>((*) Seriously: what is it with Russia that so many people fall from windows now. I never noticed them being any different than ours when I learned there for a month.)</p>

        <p>Explain how you arrived at the conclusion that wearing masks is effective protection against COVID even though WHO, CDC and Fauci have all had conflicting statements on the matter? Was it a matter of "ehhh I dont care let's just put them on to get it over with", or what?</p>

        <p>The thing I did cite most as of april 2020 was the <a href="https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/I/Influenza/Pandemieplanung/Downloads/Pandemieplan_Teil_II_gesamt.html?nn=2370466">pandemic planning document</a> of the RKI (German government's central scientific institution in the field of biomedicine) 2016/17, scientific addendum, page 75ff evaluating masks in clinical and private surroundings, using several studies, including one about ... Sars-Cov1. Sorry, I'm using the pages # of the one that's in German, but you can easily find the referred to studies. Don't have looked at the short english version.The month before I liked to cite a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285078/">household study in Berlin 2011</a> evaluating Influenza-reinfection in Influenza tested household using hand washing, hand washing and chirurgical masks as intervention. 2/3 less re-infections with the latter. It's been cited in the RKI plan too.Containment of aerosol spread infections isn't that new (but still badly researched, which is why:)</p>
<p>The conflicting statements ... ah, please don't hold your breath finding a lot of controversy if scientists change their mind if new facts are present. That's after all how we got from "yohoo Newton all the way" to "oops, there is something not quite right" for mechanics.</p>
<p>Most of the controversy in Germany stemmed from the idiotic abbreviation/miscommunication of "we don't yet know if masks really help if non-medical personnel uses them, but please buy none, as the medical personnel needs them urgently".</p>
<p>There are still some assumption floating around:</p>
<ul>
<li>"the virus is too small": yes, but the aerosols not</li>
<li>"you can't protect yourself completely with masks": yes, but you can reduce the risk, like .... with a seatbelt (and yes, a seatbelt protects others in the care being hit by you)</li>
<li>"I don't have to care, I'm young": yes, but asymptotic carriers can spread the illness to people who must care, like ... with Polio (95% asymptotic infections, 0.1-1% paralysis/death)</li>
</ul>
<p>But hey, it has only been 10 months. This thing is completely new, isn't it?</p>

<p>From your study. So they don’t work, actually.</p>
<p>This is just a study designed , as expected, to portray the idea that masks work effectively but if you actually read the study the evidence doesn’t actually suggest this very strongly ...</p>

        <p><em>not in aerosols</em> at the end there, you see?</p>
<p>Reducing water droplets <em>does not equate to effective reduction in viral spread</em> </p>
<p>The virus doesn’t need water droplets to carry it. Aerosol is effective. Vapor essentially, which is not blocked by masks.</p>
<p>If you reduce one way in which the virus spreads but do nothing about other vectors then it’s still gonna spread.</p>
<p>This study is designed to appear to the average person as pro mask evidence but in reality it is no such thing, it’s circle jerking basically .</p>

        <p>From the same study you're quoting, a sentence later: " This has important implications for control of COVID-19, suggesting that surgical face masks could be used by ill people to reduce onward transmission."  </p>
<p>Yes, reducing respiratory droplets does reduce transmission. We have several threads that prove the efficacy of masks, from experimental studies to case studies to epidemiological data. These threads together converge to produce an incredibly convincing picture. You can pick and choose a single sentence that sounds on the surface supportive of your arguments, but you leave out the context and conclusions 1 sentence later where the researchers find it has implications for reducing spread. And that's one out of 4 sources I've provided.  </p>
<p>The overwhelming evidence supports mask-wearing to reduce spread.</p>
