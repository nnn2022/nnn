    <strong>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof</strong>
    <p><p>Extraordinary claims and extraordinary actions require extraordinary proof. 
I have not seen any. What I have seen is the Covid cases number. I’ve seen them every day, all day, all over the news. This tells me almost nothing. Somehow the world has decided to pretend that there is no such thing as a qualitative assessment of quantitative data. There is an anecdote that speaks directly to this. In WW1 the French were facing brutal casualties and in response new, state of the art, helmets were issued to soldiers. Later, on assessment, they discovered head injuries increased +300%. The general was dumbfounded by this an sought to end the new helmet initiative. However, on further examination, they realized that prior to issuing these helmets soldier who sustained blows to the head would, more often than not, just die. The soldiers who otherwise would have died were instead getting head injuries and being recorded as such.  This is, seemingly, what is going on here. I see the Covid case number every day but never as a function of test done. 
I see hospitals are at x% of capacity but never benchmarked against avg capacity year over year. I have never once see a the data for total pulmonary deaths for this year compared to the past 5 years. 
What is the delta between the number of pulmonary deaths this year vs the avg for the past 5 – 10 years?</p>
<p>I would also mention that I put no more weight in what physicians have to say about  Covid than I would anyone else. If I were sick with Covid I would absolutely seeking the advice and treatment of a physician. That is what they are trained to do. They are trained to treat people infected with pathogens or suffering from some other illness or condition. This is not a medical problem. This is a data and an analytics problem. This is not some revelation either. It is plainly obvious. </p>
<p>I am not disagreeing with the science because there is no science. I am disagreeing (apparently) with many, many, scientist. There is a very real difference. </p>
<p>And finally I am disgusted by every single government employee who has not missed cashing a single check since the start of this. We should vote on lockdowns and every person who votes for them should be forced to donate a modest 25% of their income to a fund for those who are, and have, been prevented from working. </p>
<p>We have all given up an unprecedented amount of our liberties and the government continues to over-reach. </p>
<p>Ontario (where I live) is potentially mandating a curfew. If this comes to pass I will purposefully break it and I will completely stop wearing my mask.</p>
<p>I read something on this sub that really woke me up. Paraphrasing "If you think they are ever just going to <strong>give you back the liberties</strong> they took you're wrong." There will be no return to normalcy until we decide for ourselves we are taking back our old lives. </p>
<p>“Those who give up liberty for security deserve neither.”</p>

        <p>Qualitative is great, though Some context on the last quote -</p>
<p>&rt; He was writing about a tax dispute between the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the family of the Penns, the proprietary family of the Pennsylvania colony who ruled it from afar. And the legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. And the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly's acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.</p>
