    <strong>Reminder: ‘Their’ goal is to kill the individual</strong>
    <p><p>Firstly, who are ‘they’? We must define a clear propagating source. On the surface, ‘they’ appear to be the Democratic Party Leadership. The GOP. They appear to be Dr. Anthony Fauci, and the CDC. The ‘World Health Organization’. Peer further - ‘World Economic Forum’. Why is the Chinese Communist Party so prevalent in our politics? In our media? In our entertainment? </p>
<p>‘They’ are a hierarchy of corrupt leadership sources dictated by a higher entity of corrupt leadership. Who’s at the top? Perhaps the Gates and the Rothschilds? Yes, perhaps. But, it is important to outline these sources. The enemy is not your co worker who believes in masks and lockdowns, but the directives leading these beliefs. </p>
<p>In many ways, we can see this agenda very clearly is planned out to kill individual empowerment. Via face masks, via social distancing, via the general idea of ‘we’re all in this together’. So, why kill the individual? </p>
<p>It’s very clear to me - ‘the people’ have the power, not these shadow groups, not these ad hominem local and federal politicians. </p>
<p>And when ‘the people’ formulate in community, the power is prevalent. And these shadow dictators know that, hence ‘social distancing’. </p>
<p>Folks of the r/NoNewNormal community, consider yourself special in a very important and particular way. To some degree, you’re a critical thinker. You ask questions, and you can decipher between fallacy and reality. Congratulations, that’s an important regard. </p>
<p>Just as important as that regard is the fact that these shadow dictators want to strip you of those abilities. </p>
<p>200 years ago, our communities had a much more defined and held position on personal liberty. And surely, slowly, through societal conditionings, we’ve been trained to give up our position of power to those in suits on television. Self proclaimed experts, who have been voted in to work FOR the people. Only, they are not doing that, and now here we are. Facing a massive uphill battle, and surely the worst has yet to come. </p>
<p>‘We The People’ must never forget - we are the country. We are the power. Not Nancy Pelosi, not Trump, not Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>In light of heavy censorship from these Silicon Valley mega corporations, we must establish and provide sanctuaries for safe discussions. This is a highly uncertain time, and I invite you to continue these discussions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Having said that, come <a href="https://discord.gg/keyTqMYq3v">join us</a>. Join the fight to protect yourself and those around you, whether they are aware of it or not. </p>
<p>Once upon a time, in a pivotal time in American history, important words were spoken - “Give me liberty, or give me death”. Do not forget fellow individuals. The worst is yet to come.</p></p>

        <p>This is clear to me also.</p>
<p>They're trying to crush the human spirit, because people are becoming aware of how much power they have as an individual. </p>
<p>Theoretically, as people become more aware, they will understand that they can have a passion in life, pursue it in the form of individual enterprise (especially with the internet), and have total autonomy with income and individual freedom.</p>
<p>That means their indoctrination system (school - university - debt - 9-5 - bondage and service to "the man") begins to fall apart as people recognize they don't need it, and never did.</p>
<p>So what do they do to maintain power? Exactly what they're doing now. Destroy it all, make people afraid and confused, make them beg for government to fix it, shut down any opposing views.</p>
<p>What they don't realize is that once you clamp down on society in such a way people inevitably wake up. Once you wake up, you can't go back to sleep. I'd be confident in saying that they have awaken a sleeping giant called consciousness, and there is no going back.</p>
<p>What this means is that the elites, powers that be, whatever you want to call them, have already lost. It might take some time, but enjoy the show because we're going to witness this thing completely unravel.</p>

        <p>Individuals comprise society. That’s like saying cells aren’t important to a body. Ridiculous. Agree we are in it together but individualism is what makes us great and unique as human beings.</p>

        <p>Arguably it’s a power trip for certain individuals to scream at others to ‘put a mask on’, followed by guilt trips of killing granny. </p>
<p>On the other end, all I see is lazy media consumers who do not question what comes from said media, ever.</p>
