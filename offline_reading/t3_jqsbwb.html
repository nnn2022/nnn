<title>a Chinese research paper from PubMed exposed around 80% of PCR tests as false positives. Unfortunately, it was quietly withdrawn as it doesn‚Äôt fit the current narrative.</title>

        <p>SS: I mean, we already know this is a scam. But, direct quote: </p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the infection rate of the close contacts and the sensitivity and specificity of reported results were taken as the point estimates, the positive predictive value of the active screening was only 19.67%, in contrast, the false-positive rate of positive results was 80.33%. The multivariate-probabilistic sensitivity analysis results supported the base-case findings, with a 75% probability for the false-positive rate of positive results over 47%. Conclusions: In the close contacts of COVID-19 patients, nearly half or even more of the 'asymptomatic infected individuals' reported in the active nucleic acid test screening might be false positives.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I remember since the first days of the stupid weak fakedemic that cruise ship in Japan, an old guy from UK was sharing all his adventure on the ship. I clearly remember him saying that those tests were a stupid joke. (positive, negative, negative, positive, negative) all the time. 100% unreliable. </p>
<p>another funny story is that on my last holiday in Turkey (fully open country without tests or BS) I‚Äôve meet a guy who work in a very important position in a very big hotel chain in Turkey, according to him, they‚Äôve received around +60K tourists in summer, which about 95% percentage of them had to make a test to go back to their countries or transit between other countries, it turns out that <strong>100%</strong>  all them tested negative (after been partying and enjoying the city with thousands of tourists from all around the world. (there nobody cares the stupid virus anymore) 
what does that means? (everybody negative) simple: Turkish government wanted to receive tourists to improve the economy of the country and don‚Äôt give any stupid hassle to the tourists üëç</p>
<p>&rt; Turkey hosted 5.4 million foreign visitors in the first seven months of 2020</p>

        <p>I haven‚Äôt read the article but I will have to read this, it‚Äôs kind of knowledge that was shared by real scientists and professionals in regards to the PCR test which is why I always stress that the case numbers don‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt mean much, one should look at the hospitalizations and number of deaths and compare them to a few years back to get a somewhat accurate number. Glad to see articles like this are being posted and coming out to be quite honest with you, the more people realize this is a scam and realize a lot of this has been blown out of proportion, the sooner we can put an end to this nonsense</p>

        <p>Right? And why they can say Trump is an actual
Murderer and responsible for people dying from a fucking flu.  They will recalibrate the machines and like magic, Biden in office will see dropping cases and the hysteria will die down and people won‚Äôt run to the hospital with a fever for a test and a hospital bed. Covid solved.</p>
