    <strong>This is the public statement from Grace Life Church in Edmonton, Alberta, a church with the balls to stand up to the Lie.</strong>
    <p><p>Dear fellow Albertans,</p>
<p>It goes without saying this has been an incredibly difficult 11 months. The effects and ramifications of COVID-19 on our precious  province are not insignificant. We sympathize with everyone who has  suffered loss in this time, whether it be the loss of a loved one, or  loss stemming from government lockdowns (such as economic loss or  suffering as a result of being denied necessary health care).</p>
<p>Given the attention our church has received in recent days, we want  to address the broader public on our reasons for gathering as a local  church. What follows is not a theological defence. We have already  addressed that sufficiently <a href="https://youtu.be/Dh6nXD4Rtg0">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/QBzbvIyiSYs">here</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/fD-VIKSl-z4">here</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/DMT6BiHteLU">here</a>  (and it is primarily and predominantly obedience to our Lord and Savior  Jesus Christ that has shaped our stance). Instead, what follows will  shed light on our approach to what is being called a “pandemic.” The  reason we put “pandemic” in quotes is because the definition of a  pandemic was changed about 10 years ago. At one time, a pandemic was  defined as an infectious disease that resulted in a certain percentage  of excess deaths over and above normal annual averages. The definition  was changed in connection with H1N1 to remove this threshold. Ten years  ago, COVID-19 would not have qualified as a pandemic. In fact, not even  close.</p>
<p>When COVID-19 first appeared, we shifted to livestream and abided by  most of the new government guidelines for our gatherings. But when the  first declared public health emergency ended, we opened our doors and  returned to nearly normal gatherings on Sunday June 21st, 2020. We did  so recognizing COVID-19 was much less severe than the government had  initially projected. This sentiment was reflected in the assessment of  the Premier of Alberta, who deliberately referred to COVID-19 as  “influenza” multiple times in a speech announcing the end of the first  declared public health emergency.</p>
<p>In early July, it was brought to our attention that two separate  individuals had attended our gatherings on two consecutive Sundays and  subsequently tested positive for the virus (both cases being unrelated  to each other). At that time, we did our own internal contact tracing  (prior to AHS notifying us of the exposure), many of our congregants  were tested, and it was determined that no transmission of the virus had  taken place. Out of an abundance of caution, we shifted exclusively to  livestream and shutdown all other ministries for two weeks (14 days). We  did this to mitigate any further spread of COVID-19. When it was  evident that no further spread had taken place, we resumed our nearly  normal gatherings. Since then, we have gathered as a church each Sunday  without incident (28 Sundays to date).</p>
<p>Having engaged in an immense amount of research, interacting with  both doctors and frontline healthcare workers, it is apparent that the  negative effects of the government lockdown measures on society far  surpass the effects of COVID-19. The science being used to justify  lockdown measures is both suspect and selective. In fact, there is no  empirical evidence that lockdowns are effective in mitigating the spread  of the virus. We are gravely concerned that COVID-19 is being used to  fundamentally alter society and strip us all of our civil liberties. By  the time the so-called “pandemic” is over, if it is ever permitted to be  over, Albertans will be utterly reliant on government, instead of free,  prosperous, and independent.</p>
<p>As such, we believe love for our neighbor demands that we exercise  our civil liberties. We do not see our actions as perpetuating the  longevity of COVID-19 or any other virus that will inevitably come  along. If anything, we see our actions as contributing to its end – the  end of destructive lockdowns and the end of the attempt to  institutionalize the debilitating fear of viral infections. Our local  church is clear evidence that governmental lockdowns are unnecessary. In  fact, it is also evidence of how harmful they are. Without going into  detail, we recently lost the life of one of our precious congregants who  was denied necessary health care due to government lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Consider the following statistics. It is alleged that 129,075  Albertans have tested positive for the virus. That works out to just  less than 3% of the population. However, it needs to be pointed out that  the PCR test being used to test for COVID-19 is fraught with false  positives. This is especially true, since at least until recently,  Alberta was running the PCR test at 40 amplifications. As such, the  number of Albertans who have actually contracted the virus is likely  significantly less. It is also vital to highlight that more than 99% of  those who contract the virus will fully recover.</p>
<p>Alberta is currently reporting 1,782 COVID-related deaths. It is  critically important to articulate it this way. There is a big  difference between dying from COVID and dying with COVID. But it is also  critical to note that these COVID-related deaths, as tragic as they  are, have not resulted in a statistically significant increase in excess  deaths (and the average age of those who have died related to COVID-19  is 82, consistent with life expectancy in Alberta). Sadly, most of these  individuals would have likely died due to various other lethal  co-morbidities (and it immensely grieves us that in many cases they were  forced to die apart from their family unnecessarily). In addition,  experts estimate that deaths, in the long run, resulting from government  lockdown measures will surpass COVID-related deaths 10 to 1 (e.g.  premature deaths resulting from not receiving necessary health care,  suicides, drug overdoses, addictions, the development of chronic health  conditions, total loss of income, family breakdown, etc.). In fact, it  would seem that COVID-related deaths are being treated as though they  are somehow more tragic than any and all other deaths.</p>
<p>Many Albertans are afraid and are convinced of the efficacy of  government lockdowns for two reasons: misinformation and fearmongering.  The media has so pounded the COVID-19 drum since the “pandemic” began,  almost exclusively emphasizing caseload and deaths, that people are  fearful. So fearful, in fact, they have been convinced that yielding up  their civil liberties to the government is in their best interests. It  is difficult to have not lost confidence in the mainstream media. It  would seem as though journalism is on life-support in our province. The  media should be made up of the most thorough, discerning, and  investigative people in our society. Instead, many of them seem to be  serving an ideological agenda. Now more than ever, it is vital that  Albertans exercise discernment when listening to the mainstream media.</p>
<p>What do we believe people should do? We believe they should  responsibly return to their lives. Churches should open, businesses  should open, families and friends should come together around meals, and  people should begin to exercise their civil liberties again. Otherwise  we may not get them back. In fact, some say we are on the cusp of  reaching the point of no return. Protect the vulnerable, exercise  reasonable precautions, but begin to live your lives again.</p>
<p>That said, living life comes with risks. Every time we get behind the  wheel of a car, we are assuming a degree of risk. We accept that risk  due to the benefits of driving. Yes, though vastly overblown, there are  associated risks with COVID-19, as there are with other infections.  Human life, though precious, is fragile. As such, death looms over all  of us. That is why we need a message of hope. One that addresses our  greatest need. That message is found in Jesus Christ. It is found in Him  because all of us have sinned and have fallen short of God’s perfect  standard of righteousness (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Rom%203.23">Rom 3:23</a>).  To sin is to violate the holiness and righteousness of God. As our  Creator, He is the one who will judge us according to our deeds and no  one will stand on their own merit in that judgment. Therefore, we need a  substitute. One who has both lived the life we could not and died the  death we deserve.</p>
<p>Praise be to God, there is! God the Father commissioned His Son into the world, to take upon Himself human flesh (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%201.14">John 1:14</a>), being true God and true man, whereby He lived under the Law of God (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Gal%204.4">Gal 4:4</a>), fulfilled it in every respect, was tempted in all things as we are, and yet was without sin (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Heb%204.15">Heb 4:15</a>).  Then, in obedience to the Father, He went to the cross, drank the full  cup of the Father’s wrath for the sin of all who would ever believe on  His name, died, and rose again! In this way, He proved He had conquered  both sin and death, our two greatest enemies. He has ascended into  heaven and is now seated at the right hand of the Father (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Col%203.1">Col 3:1</a>), awaiting the time of His Second Coming.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this message of salvation is to be proclaimed to all people (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt%2028.18%E2%80%9320">Matt 28:18–20</a>).  In fact, the church exists to proclaim this message! That if you would  turn from your sin and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, putting full  trust in His finished work on the cross along with His resurrection from  the dead, you will be saved! Not only will all of your sins be forgiven  you, but you will also be credited with a perfect record of  righteousness; the very righteousness of Christ (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/2%20Cor%205.21">2 Cor 5:21</a>). And so, we would urge you to be reconciled to God through His Son this day. The very one who has given you life and breath.</p>
<p>Should you do so, you will receive eternal life and will experience life after death (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/John%2011.25">John 11:25</a>).</p>
<p>Death looms over all of us. But there is a message of concrete hope, in the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p>I enjoy hearing about you on the news. It drives people away from religion. Your church is a ridiculous joke of the past. Look at all you wrote. With so little interaction. You are so out of touch. You even start a post with "Dear Fellow Albertans". What fucking year do you think thou art in. 🤡</p>

        <p>Listen fruit cup, first of all you haven't heard about me on the news, secondly people have the right to choose whatever religion they like, third church is not a joke of the past, it is still a massive part of today's world (like it or not), fourth I didn't write that, I'm from BC, fifth, there is nothing wrong with saying "Dear fellow Albertans", that is a modern thing to say. Are you are ugly as you are stupid? Better put that mask on.</p>
