    <strong>Some people make no sense whatsoever.</strong>
    <p><p>So, my granddaughter's friend who lives in another city came and stayed over with the weekend. When I dropped the friend off, her mom was telling me how they are fully reopening the schools in her district this week because too many kids are failing and not attending. She's all freaked out because she doesn't know what's going to happen now that all the kids are back to school.</p>
<p>But, here's the best part of our conversation... 5 minutes later she was telling me about the birthday party they went to a few weeks ago. And a couple of months ago, they had a party for her son and daugh t er. They also go out and eat 7 days a week, sitting down in a restaurant to eat.</p>
<p>Makes no sense whatsoever.</p></p>

        <p>I know what you mean. I live with my girlfriend and her parents and My girlfriends 63 year old father is a cancer survivor. If anyone in our household is to be quarantined and protected from getting COVID, it’s him. Due to quarantine and losing my job, I almost never leave the house. At one point, my girlfriend and I got into a slight argument about all the quarantine and mask bullshit. She told me that if I somehow went outside and got COVID and brought it into the house I would be automatically kicked out of the house with no where to go. No job no house. 
A couple days after this she tells me the whole family, me, her, her parents including her father, and her brothers were all going out to a sushi restaurant  to celebrate her aunts 70th birthday.. what fucking sense does that make?!?</p>
