    <strong>I finally took the plunge...</strong>
    <p><p>I went to the supermarket this morning, and for the first time I didn't wear a mask. I was greeted at the door with a somewhat gruff, 'oi mate av u got a mask?' I said, 'nah mate I'm exempt' and it worked nicely, though I could see that the guy did not like the answer. And it did not matter at all, there's nothing he could legally do to stop me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It was euphoric walking round the shop without the muzzle, I was trying my best to restrain the iridescent grin fighting it's way onto my face. I got a few funny looks, but no problems from people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The best part occurred when I was about to buy my food, I turned to my right and saw an elderly lady, also without the muzzle, smiling at me as if I were the risen Christ. It felt good man.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm glad I finally scooped up my balls and plucked up the courage to defy, it was a rush akin to acts of childhood mischief. And despite all the threatening 'government mandate reeeeeeeeeee' signs plastered around Sainsbury's like bandages on a leper, I received no backlash for abstaining from the so-called 'mandatory' breathing impediment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I plan to continue this localised act of defiance; though small and petty, it all counts at the end of the day. Don't live in fear.</p></p>
