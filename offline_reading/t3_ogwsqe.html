    <strong>There might be a conspiracy, but not the one most seem to think</strong>
    <p><p>What if the actual covid conspiracy is that the government gives the vaccine to see who is a "good" or "bad" citizen. The vaccine is actually protection against another virus that they will be releasing in a few years time, that ones goal will be to remove the unvaccinated citizens that don't follow their rules. This would make more sense, no? As in it would benefit them more than releasing a poisonous vaccine to kill/sterilise the only people supposedly listening to them and giving them support, no?</p></p>

        <p>No, its far more likely that theyd kill those who got the shot.</p>
<p>Those who got the shot are likely OLD people, and people who were actually scared of the virus (useful idiots), and doomers who have been useless eaters, depending on unemployment b/c they were too afraid to go to work.</p>
<p>On the other side, the people that WONT get the shot are largely those in the trades/farmers. You know, useful skills that could be used to keep society [the elite] running with essentials.</p>
<p>Every. Single. Communist takeover kills their useful idiots right after they gain absolute power. Why? B/c those that are zealous enough to go along with the plan are zealous enough to revolt when they find out theyve been conned.</p>

        <p>I've been born in socials country and loved through its collapse, not once did i hear them going after the people that supported them. They always "got rid" of the people that didn't agree with them and tried to spread anti system and counter revolutionary ideas.
In this case those are the people that don't want to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Also idk where you're getting this but tradesmen =/= anti vax...</p>
<p>I think your theory makes no sense at all, from the perspective of the supposed elites goals. Docile workers are far more productive than ones that spend time thinking and arguing against the leadership mate</p>

        <p>Docile workers? The ones living on unemployment for over a year that are still scared to socialize even though they are vaxxed? Those people are utterly useless to society. The ones screaming on social media to "just stay inside fir grandma" are the pathetic revolutionaries in this movement. Those were the ones that went along with it, and snitched on their neighbors and local businesses.</p>
<p>Im sure a lot of the revolutionaries were killed off in your country right after the regime changed. It happened to the red peasants in russia, to che &amp; castros upper eschelons and peasant militias, to trotskyian forces, etc.</p>
<p>More and more office jobs are becoming obsolete due to AI. Thise people will soon be obsoleye and useless eaters.</p>
<p>You will find a much higher % of un-vaxxed people in conservative groups. Tradesmen are MUCH more likely to be conservative because many work for themselves.</p>

        <p>Not sure what you're talking about.
You think that you can't train the human body to be resistant to a specific microbe that it might encounter in the future?</p>
<p>Also like i said if it's "pure poison" how does that benefit the government? They are killing the people that listen to them? So that they end up with more and more people that don't listen to them?</p>

        <p>Ive thought about it. And honestly if they feel the need to use calculated biological warfare to remove "dissenters" who want to make their own decisions for themselves and abide by objectively moral principles id be happier dead than living in a world that runs on subjective moral relativism/reasoning.</p>
<p>Bad news for anyone who gets a mark which without it you cant engage in commerce. So you can get the shot and live in that world until you inevitably burn forever in the sulfur pits or you can stick to first principles and not be swayed by theoretical scenarios and coercive tactics.</p>

        <p>You are probably right. However, it's a government pipe dream. It looks like if you weed out all 'no compliant' people you go to a bureacratic heaven, however it has never really happened in  history, at least not as advertized.</p>
<p>You need smart and truth-seeking people to remain competitive. Mindless sheeple don't know what to do unless they are told to. As you see, North Korea, who has successfully weeded out all noncompliance is unable to even generate enough electricity for the country.</p>

<p>US hate on communists is a 1980s thingy. Now you can get into more trouble by saying something bad about communists than being a communist. </p>
<p>So in terms of bias, the current media is  interested more in embellishing north korean life rather than presenting the horros of it. Already MSM are reporting that Soviet Gulag was not what we think it was. These were not prison camps, but more like a fun reeducation camps for 1930-s Trump supporters.</p>

        <p>What's the reasoning behind your instinct tho?
Wouldn't it make more sense for them to want to get rid of the people that don't listen to them, than to actually focus their eradication onto the only people that do what they ask them to do</p>

        <p>They've already publicly stated they plan to vaccinate us so we will not want to eat meat... you know to protect us against "climate change".    The nazis experimented long ago with adding things to the water supply of subjugated areas (like..... fluoride..) that help make the population more docile and reduce population growth.  Not too far fetched to see that being done in a vax.  GPS tracking, RFID tags for commerce, the skies the limit if we let them get away with it.  If only there was a really old book that warned us that all of this would happen.....</p>

        <p>I mean I've read quite a few articles about the impact the meat industry does, and its quite disturbing, irrespective of what Gates says or thinks.
Most of the amazon rainforest is truly being cut down for livestock farms. Also imagine the amount of filth thousands of cows or chickens produce while being locked into tightly packed industrial farms, its nasty af. Plus historic books shows that humans didn't really eat as much meat as we do today.
So i think that ones a bit of a stretch, Gates might have just made a prediction that we'll reduce out reliance of farm animals init</p>

        <p>The people getting the vaccine are suffering from blood clots, personality changes, cognitive decline and more. The ones with no side effects probably got saline. I think it’s more likely they weed out all the sheep then they have a small population of dissidents to deal with. The vaccinated will probably not die immediately but will have cognitive changes and they’ll easily turn them all against us. They’ll either force vaccinate the remaining people or throw us in a camp as they are already alluding to. I think that’s why their goal is 70%, that’s probably when the odds turn in their favor if there were a war.</p>

        <p>Too many steps and too complex plan imo. Personality and mind altering serums i imagine would be far more expensive to produce than to just give out a vaccine that makes the people who take it immune to a new virus you release.

<p>How many vaccines did you read up about tho, pretty sure there have been worse. Also apparently statistics show that serious complications from the vaccine are much fewer than complications due to the virus</p>

        <p>If the MRNA therapy actually prevents symptoms (and that's a big if), there is a real possibility that people keep walking around for longer with a virus that would normally keep them in bed, so the virus has to cause more severe symptoms before they stop spreading it, leading to more severe illness in the unvaccinated.</p>

<p>Does it kind of worry me, yes, but not enough to risk getting the shot.</p>
<p>If I'm wrong... Well, that's a world I don't want to live in. I've already made peace with that.</p>

        <p>I was thinking the vaccine acting like a trojan horse so they can release a more fatale virus without worrying about its capability to infect and spread without the host dying on them. A preinjected vaccine that contains special protein that allows the new virus to bond easier would solve the weak corona virus we are facing right now (for the majority people).</p>
