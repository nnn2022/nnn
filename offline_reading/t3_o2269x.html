    <strong>Three months ago, my mother committed suicide. She was afraid of where this world was going, and I don’t blame her.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not sure what else to say. I haven’t said anything about it on here, but I really have to let it go.</p>
<p>My mom was a beloved case manager at a methadone clinic. She gave her every living hour trying to get people better, knowing methadone was hopeless but still trying. She tried multiple therapies, and a bunch of classes she set up to keep them happy and occupied. A lot of them killed them selves, or overdosed, or just disappeared. But for years, she tried and tried. </p>
<p>Until she told me she doesn’t want to live in a world like this. I told her I know it’s depressing, I know it’s hard. But if we don’t go out fighting, what’s the use? Tyranny, data collection, it goes so deep. Even when I worked in the city, I saw people walk over homeless people on the street to their tech jobs and wondered “what the fuck is wrong with these people? How does this not bother you?”</p>
<p>I don’t know where else to talk about it, I guess. I just want to thank you guys for seeing through it.</p></p>

        <p>I’m so sorry for your loss- how heartbreaking. Sending you so much love.</p>
<p>I know someone, too- she killed herself back in April of ‘20, and her brother did, too, three months prior. Had everything going for her, was a wonderful, kind woman, her brother was a great man with a beautiful family. They were both in their 60’s. It’s so hard to wrap my mind around.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry to read this. My cousin killed himself for similar reasons right before Christmas. It's so horrible that these deaths aren't tallied as deaths due to fallout. I blame the media, our politicians, corrupt scientists, and scandalous pharmaceutical companies for destroying the lives of many more than would ever die of covid. It's insane and it's pushed under the rug as collateral damage, then forgotten. 
I hate what this world has become and what we humans do to each other in the name of fear and 'safety'. Your mom deserved a better world than this. We all do.</p>

        <p>Terrible, heartfelt condolences. </p>
<p>This is something that has been given zero care or attention by our government in the UK. </p>
<p>There will countless lost lives from suicide an unimaginable amount and it will continue for years to come as people struggle to adapt to being divided and enduring bullying like we have never seen before. </p>
<p>I see myself as extremely headstrong but even I found myself in dark places this last year so I am sure we all have at times.</p>

        <p>My mom died about 3months ago as well and her last words was my name... it was a beautiful moment ,I know it sounds weird to say that but out of all the ways you can die I think doing it while looking at your only son is a  ok way to go in my book... </p>
<p>I sometimes feel exactly like you watching the world like it's a dream of how we treat each other and I can sit for a while just thinking what it would take to really I mean REALLY change this world and why we are this way and then I think I'm happy my mothers not here to live on this planet anymore because after all the thinking I'll do i still wouldn't  have a answer and I'm not saying their isint 1 I jus haven't discovered 1 yet </p>
<p>I'm really sorry about your mom and I dont doubt saying that this community got your back now and for as long as you need</p>

        <p>It’s fucking hilarious that people actually believe that anyone cares about Covid 19 deaths. Go to California and see people with masks on walking past dirty motherfuckers floundering alone on a sidewalk and if they didn’t have a mask on they’d probably spit on them as they walk past. As if anyone had any fucking empathy. People are just terrified, stupid, mentally enslaved robots at this point willing to swallow any amount of horse shit from master if it means they arent the ones rocking the boat and being kicked off to die on a sidewalk.</p>

        <p>LA will experience a severe public health disaster sooner or later. It has a large homeless population, can't afford to even clean up its own rubbish. Most of the population are from 3rd world countries and have no idea or inclination to maintain the infrastructure like water or sanitation. It could be anything from Cholera to plague which ravages the city.</p>

<p>Stories like yours is what I’ve been most furious about this entire time.  People like your mother have been forgotten in the narrative of this event.  Understand though that is only by MSM and the sheep.  Millions of us are here thinking of her with broken hearts.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry for your loss. I hope your mom is at peace now.</p>
<p>This is honestly why I'm selfish for the most part. I used to be much more into charities and trying to "heal the world" and save those in need of help. I found that once you go down that road, life becomes more and more depressing. </p>
<p>This world cannot be fixed, in my opinion. But God bless people like your mom who tried. May her memory live on. Once again, I'm so sorry for your pain and loss.</p>

        <p>My dad’s dad shot himself in front of the family right before I was born and my dad shot himself 13 years ago yesterday on June 16, 2008.</p>
<p>I’m sorry you’re going through this, I still miss my dad but the grief gets more bearable over time. I believe in the Spirit and that we will reconnect with family after the material experience ends, I used to be a militant atheist but I got so many undeniable signs over the last few years that I have no doubt anymore.

I feel much like she did and I also know someone who killed himself March 2020 because of the state of the world and where its headed. I hope someday we manage to make it a place that deserves people like them. Wishing you all the best.</p>

        <p>Wow as I’m reading this, the amount of people I and many others in this thread have lost due to suicide this past year is terrifying. The psychological torture this pandemic has done is irreversible.</p>

        <p>My mother was addicted to opiates, so I know what it’s like. People like your mother are a Godsend. I watched firsthand as my mom slowly ruined her life. She got really involved recreationally with my cousin (her god-son) and he eventually overdosed and passed away. My mom mentally went astray after that and has never been the same.</p>

        <p>I'm very sorry for your loss. It sounds like your mother was a very caring and giving person, trying to help others to the point where she didn't fully realize the toll it was taking on her until it was too late.</p>
<p>I agree with you that we should fight rather than surrender.</p>
<p>People going to their tech jobs might be bothered walking over homeless people, but what can they do about it? Most people aren't equipped to take care of random strangers, many of whom are drug addicted or mentally ill. Working people pay a lot in taxes to have the government help the homeless, but many in government prefer chaos and suffering to actually solving problems.</p>
<p>If we can defeat this tyranny, I believe we will find better solutions for addiction and mental illness. Those running the pharmaceutical show don't profit from potential cures and have the power to bury them. So there may be a lot out there hidden from view.</p>
<p>May you find a way to honor your mother's memory, maybe by finding the strength to fight the tyranny that contributed to her suffering.</p>

        <p>My dear fellow nnn, my heart goes out to you. Both my parents died in 2020, the unnecessary lockdown prevented my mom flying in. I still feel amputated without her. Two cops took me to the Urgent Psychiatric Care for eval since I had suicidal thoughts this January. Now I'm so glad someone called 911, and I'm in therapy for my grief. </p>
<p>My mother was in fear too, she had stashed newspaper articles on the pandemic. Stranger and fellow mourner, it was tyrannical, unjust and cruel. It was always rules for thee not me, and that the population at large couldn't see through it is not entirely their fault. I have two decades of being a Libertarian that helped. Sending you a big hug from NM.</p>
<p>Edit: added January</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing. It certainly feels like we are the only hope for the future generations here in America. Seems like Russia and some places in Europe are moving in a direction more in support of their future generations.</p>
<p>I love the United States of America. I love that we can stand united as a people of such different walks of life and different cultures. And I know it's got good bad and ugly but we need to take the good with the bad and really make good with what we got handed.</p>
<p>The data collection is certainly something that causes a lot of inner strife in my psyche. And the cryptocurrency too is something I definitely do not want.</p>

        <p>I am so very sorry to hear about your loss.  Although she died of cancer, my mother was a hospice social worker so I understand what it's like to watch someone scream into the wind.</p>
<p>I know this might be only a small comfort, but your mother did make the world a better place.  As someone in recovery I can tell you that, as hopeless as it all seemed, your mother helped countless addicts.  I promise you that some of those who disappeared from the clinic did so because they started going to meetings and ditched the methadone.  I know so many people who used to be on methadone and have been clean and healthy for years.  I wish I could have told your mother that and thanked her.</p>
<p>I won't give you any platitudes because they made me so angry when my mother passed, but I will share my experience.  Be prepared for the grieving to come in waves and let yourself take time when you need it.  I had days where I didn't think of my mother and was happy and was wracked with guilt because of it, and days when I was too depressed to get out of bed.  Both are normal and can come well after you feel like you should be OK.  Please take care.</p>
<p>After the MOASS I will be giving to addiction and mental health causes (amongst others).  Maybe we can create a world that's a little less terrible than this one.</p>

        <p>I'm going to start telling the people I know who used to be on methadone to tell their old clinics that they're doing well.   I think because methadone clinics deal with so many people that they don't realize the impact that might have.</p>
<p>The worst part about America's handling of the opioid pandemic is that we have a successful blueprint that we could follow.  Portugal used to be way worse then we are.  Then, 20 years ago, they made drugs legal and started sending people to treatment instead of jail.  Portugal's current OD rate is 3 per million vs. America's 216.</p>
<p>Discovering our community was the first time I felt hopeful since I was a kid.  The world doesn't have to be this way.</p>
