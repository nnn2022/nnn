        <p>Exactly.  They don't actually work for the government.  They work for Municipal Corporations and there's no authority for them to exist.</p>
<p>Edit:  Wow this got a good amount of upvotes so I wanted to come back and add some info.  Please help spread the word.  Most People think these are government run organizations and they aren't.  They're run by criminal prosecuting attorneys all over the US, especially in small counties.  The lawyers in those counties are in on it, the public defenders, and the judges.  To verify if a "court" is government or not, you can search their Dun and Bradstreet number with their "court"s address.</p>

        <p>Edit:  You updated and added "logic, human rights" to your comment so I'll update mine.</p>
<p>I am not arguing against that, but rather illuminating the fact that they are not part of government.  You must be aware of this if you want to beat them.  File paperwork.  Don't play into their scam and hire one of their buddies at the BAR association or a public defender and most importantly don't show up for "court".  Their courts aren't actually real legal process, but a simulation of legal process.  It's a sham and seeing it for what it is, is how we beat the Municipal Corporations that employ these criminal officers.</p>

        <p>How can you stand up against them, if you aren't even familiar with what they really are?  It would be like walking into a trap and not having a ground to stand on.</p>
<p>Common law is important to learn, as it is what gives you that ground to stand on for fighting for your rights.  It's important to know that Municipal Corporations have no jurisdiction over you.  Don't show up to their sham, as it is what gives them jurisdiction over you.  You must know this if you want to have any chance at winning.</p>

<p>You seemed to imply in your first comment that government has jurisdiction over you. Who gave them this jurisdiction over you? From how you talk you seem to be one of the "sovereign citizen" folk. The litigative mumbo jumbo you spin doesn't really work in reality does it? Pardon me, all I know is some pretty surface stuff like YouTube clips about this. I feel it's more sensible to not be a citizen at all, simply a sovereign human being. I certainly am not looking to deal or cooperate with the police or the courts system if I ever can avoid it. If it can't be avoided, I'll deal with them the same way I would deal with any other highly armed and dangerous gang member: with extreme cautiousness and dishonesty. You are not morally obligated to be forthright to someone who is acting criminally towards you.</p>

Sad. We need to kick theses people out. Remove the whole fucking politic system. This is not working.</p>

        <p>The whole “nice “ thing is a lie ; they perpetuate because of their insecurity stemming from a lack of national identity . The entire Canadian identity is built on “we’re not America ,see how not American we are “? The truth is Canadian and American culture , especially at the time they separated , are very similar and it drives them crazy ; so to distance themselves they claim a false sense of moral superiority .</p>

        <p>Uh.... this is the the most incorrect and ignorant assessment of Canadians I've heard since middle school. I would be very surprised if you had any real interaction with Canadians on a regular basis. They are an extremely self-assured people with a confident national identity. It's a huge red-flag that you see them in the way you do. I really haven't heard an actual adult say the things you are I don't think ever. And as someone who did grow up interacting with Canadians on regular basis both in the states in and in Canada, and has continued to work very closely with people from many places of the world intimately, it is exactly your kind of ridiculous attitude towards others that gives Americans a bad reputation.</p>

        <p>lol. That is the most ignorant claim I've heard, even more so than the Pandemic!</p>
<p>Canada was distinguished from the US simply becasue, one we maintained a military Peacekeeping role as opposed to being an aggressor and two, Canadian tourists were well known for their non discriminatory behavior and treated people with respect, where American tourists were well known for their outright condescension, demanding and entitled behaviors.  Albeit, times have changed and unfortunately we have adopted some of those arrogant attitudes and are no longer perceived quite the same but nevertheless moral superiority is a figment of your imagination, we earned the respect by giving respect. </p>
<p>For the record, cops have always been dicks here though, with the exception of a few..It's by design. </p>
<p>Because of where i live now, i don't come across many American tourists, but about 3 years ago, while working at Canadian Tire, there was an American couple, their vehicle had broken down so they were stranded and the Husband was ill. I could see the panic and confusion in the wife's face and spent the next two hours assisting her until she was calm, had everything in order and was able to go to the Hospital to be with her Husband...She was absolutely dumbfounded by how compassionate we were and stated that she never would have received this level of kindness in her own country. Yet, I felt we had done nothing extraordinary, just helping someone in trouble, isn't that what people are supposed to do?</p>
<p>Bottom line, quit making up bullshit to  disguise and project your own personality onto others.</p>

        <p>That’s really what it seems like lately. The cops in Canada don’t even do anything about people (usually junkies) that repeatedly breaking into peoples businesses, houses and property and if they do the judicial system slaps them on the wrist and releases them, but will assault a minor for simply not wearing a mask. This country’s morals have gone down the shitter fast.</p>

        <p>I remember when I was 9 and some douchebag cop saw me at the vending machine of this office building my dad worked in, mother fucker  flashed his gun at me and told me to get him a soda when he’s back out of the bathroom. I ran away without even getting my drink crying to my dad who went down and told the piece of shit off. </p>
<p>Imagine being a 12 year old and multiple cops armed with guns you can visibly see are yelling at you and shoving you down. Imagine how traumatized kids are to this bullshit.</p>

        <p>I’m right wing too and I respect some individual cops. But my point is it’s pathetic how much conservatives worship the police when the police would be the first ones to enforce nazi mask mandates, show up at your house and take your guns if ordered too, take away your kid when you refuse the doctors advice on trans hormonal therapy, etc. The police ultimately would not be on our side when shit goes down.</p>
