    <strong>Masks at work/ school</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve seen a lot of posts lately saying their work or school is saying vaccinated people can take off their masks and unvaccinated people can’t (even though it’s a stupid rule but whatever. That’s not the point of this post). </p>
<p>In the interest of protest and avoiding unnecessary punishment for the unvaxxed, I would like to ask if those who are vaxxed and opposed to the new normal two tiered system would please wear their masks in solidarity. And also if someone tells you you can take it off just say you won’t until the rules are lifted for everyone. </p>
<p>I hate suggesting that <em>anyone</em> wear a mask at all and I want to make that abundantly clear. But it’s been indicated that the vaxxed have more privilege and voice than the unvaxxed. So if the unvaxxed were to take a stand by taking off their masks anyways, we risk punishment and also will not be taken seriously in the slightest. If the bosses see that their “favorites” won’t let discrimination enter the workforce, it may cause them to reconsider. </p>
<p>Again, it’s only in the interest of protest. I am NOT recommending masks to protect for safety. </p>
<p>If anyone has a suggestion to improve this, I’m open to it.</p></p>

        <p>Assuming you are not getting paid to post this:</p>
<p>This is a terrible idea as it makes wearing masks normal again in place where it's basically gone. People need to see masks for what they truly are: an instrument of coercion.</p>

        <p>No I know I absolutely hate the idea of it normalizing masks but they’re already normalized and I think maybe it would work??? Like a boycott?? And if it doesn’t in your workplace then idk I guess back off. 
My thinking is that the bosses want something: a segregated workplace. So if they don’t get that, maybe they’ll reconsider?</p>

        <p>How about instead of wearing a mask say even the vaccinated are against apartheid. No reason to sugar coat what they are doing. Make it uncomfortable. They are choosing to be on the wrong side of history.</p>
