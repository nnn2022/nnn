    <strong>Why are we glorifying cowardice?</strong>
    <p><p>I just can’t figure out why people are glorifying living in fear and cowering over something with such a low mortality rate. Does it suck that some people don’t survive? Yes it does. But there’s millions of things that people die from. This is just another one. There are 6 million car accidents in the US annually. Does that mean we stop driving? There’s 350,000 house fires per year. Does that mean we stop using electricity or gas? Everything in life is a risk but you can’t bubble wrap the world. I have high risk hobbies and I’ve drawn the short straw a couple times but I know what im getting into. That’s why I leave my house every day without fear. I hang out with my friends (several of which have been caught and recovered from covid with little more than a fever an loss of taste) without fear. I know the risks of living and life is worth it. I refuse to let something that spreads so easily control me.</p>
<p>I’m not denying that covid exists. It does and it can be devastating to a very small percentage of people that catch it. But this brainwashing of people that is quite literally glorifying being a coward is disgusting. Why should we all live in fear. If you’re scared you can stay home. You can order curbside pickup. You can live your life without another human interaction if you so please. But that’s not me. I’m not scared. I go to work. I go to the store. I go wherever I want. Because I’m not scared. I’m aware of the risks and I accept them. Just like you accept the risks every time you start your car or every time you turn on the stove. </p>
<p>These Doomers need to open their eyes to the real world. It’s not sunshine and rainbows. You can’t fix everything and you can’t save everyone. It’s not a perfect place and it never will be. It’s not fair. It’s not forgiving. But it’s your only life. Don’t waste it being afraid.</p></p>

        <p>These people with their "anxiety and depression" that they constantly advertise on facebook have no idea what actual illness is like. People with chronic medical conditions quickly learn that nobody is going to hold your hand and if you want to participate in the real world you need to be responsible for your own health. Social media morons have not yet learnt this and so they expect everyone else to bend over backwards to cater to their fear and stupidity.</p>

        <p>Exactly right. They scream at others for being selfish yet it's perfectly fine to expect the world to revolve around them. 
Just like how they love masks, it's all about appearances to them to be able to claim moral superiority.</p>
<p>These people are lazy and shallow and its disgusting how they like claiming anxiety and depression. As if it's just a casual trendy thing to say. It trivializes people that actually do suffer.</p>

        <p>I felt actual anxiety for the first time in my life earlier this year due to the isolation of lockdown and constant bombardment of media. Bloody awful experience and made me so much more aware of how friends who actually suffered with it in the past must have felt. Also made me understand what real anxiety is and attention seeking behaviour is.</p>

        <p>These words wouldn't even be coming out of peoples mouths had they not been 'made aware' of their so-called "conditions" in the first place. 99% just want to lazily point at an excuse and cover up their issues/ shortcomings as a 'health defect' which, wouldn't you guess it, is outside their control.  </p>

        <p>Because we live in a society that has been without good male role models for decades now.   And since Masculinity gets shamed of course a lot men will become more feminine in an attempt to gain approval.   So Cowardice gets preached as a virtue since we live in a world full of cowards so of course they wanna make themselves seem as good as possible</p>

<p>Loss of a stable family structure is definitely a problem. But it’s also the fact that we live in the age of “everyone gets a trophy” and we rarely have wars or hunger or anything. Some mothers are plenty tough, but that isn’t going to change what the rest of the world is doing. There’s also the fact that a lot of these single mothers came from unstable homes themselves. So the situation just perpetuates itself.</p>

        <p>Moms are not a blessing without a dad. Mothers are mothers and they cannot be fathers, just the same as fathers cannot be mothers.</p>
<p>You need both roles in your development or you’re set up for failure.</p>
<p>It’s also important to understand general versus universal in this scenario. Universally speaking, there are some single moms that raise excellent kids. Generally speaking, not having a father in the home is one of the biggest predictors of whether or not you will end up going to prison.</p>

        <p>In fairness, they think they’re glorifying self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>In reality, all they’re doing is saying “I’m doing X because I’m scared and I think you want me to do X, so I’m going to be offended if you don’t do X for me too.”</p>

        <p>Totally. Also, sunk cost fallacy. They think they have “worked so hard” by staying home and masking up, that they can’t quit now. </p>
<p>Ironic how they don’t acknowledge the self-sacrifice of the person out picking up their groceries and delivering them. Also, fuck those jerks who worked “essentially” to keep the globe running through all of this if they decide to go get a haircut or burger w/ friends on their day off. Selfish super-spreaders!</p>

        <p>That’s funny because 6 million accidents out of 200 million licensed drivers means there is a 3% chance that on any given year you will be involved in a car accident, making it 6-10 times more likely than you dying from covid.</p>

        <p>I'm going to take a guess and say it's all about how we're programmed psychologically speaking. I'm not an expert by any means, but I took a few psychology college classes. Humans like to look the same or do the same. There's two experiments I heard of: a group of people in an elevator with their backs facing the doors and a test group that kept giving the wrong calculation answer. 
So in the elevator one, the idea is if a person walks into an elevator and sees everyone else is facing the wall and their backs are to the door, they will also follow the group and face to the wall.
The math experiment featured a group of people with one test subject. Everyone in the group knew what was going on and one person was a legit test subject. They basically answered general math equations. So every person would say for example, 4+4=9 and the test subject would feel pressured to say 9 even though they inheritenly know it's 8.
Just my two cents. Also fear mongering can do a lot.</p>

        <p>I live in Toronto, Ontario. Every night for the last year Covid is the top story. They list the thousands who are infected and the death rate.</p>
<p>On r/Toronto they have a link to Ontario public health where you can take a deep dive into the numbers.</p>
<p>I was pretty shocked to learn that since this began 1 person between age 1-19 has died. 12 people between age 20-39 and about a 123 between the ages of 40-65.</p>
<p>About 135 people between age 1-65 have died to this virus and the rest are above 66. About 2900 people who died are eledery above 66.</p>
<p>Everyone of those deaths is a tragedy but what that tells me is this virus isn't that dangerous to anyone under the age of 65 but deadly to those who are eledery. </p>
<p>So instead of shutting down the whole economy and world we should be isolating our eledery and protecting them while letting the rest of the world live on. I would be curious how many eledery people normally die of the flu, cold, influenze etc. </p>
<p>Almost every death is at a nursing home or long term care facility here. We just had an outbreak where 12 more people at one nursing home died and more are sick. Why not put more resources into making sure that nursing homes are more protected and let the younger people continue on with their lives?</p>

        <p>You quote the number of car accidents that kill Americans every year, but we still have airbags, traffic laws, and seat belts. You quote housefires, we still equip our homes with smoke alarms and fire extinguishers. Just because some people will die of a cause does not mean we shouldn't take precautions to prevent needless deaths. Wearing a mask and social distancing isn't about being "cowardly". Its showing compassion. Its showing that you are willing to minority inconvenience yourself to keep others safe. It's all well and good if you want to sleep in you home without a fire extinguisher or smoke alarms. If it burns down, only you will likely die (assuming you live alone and in a house not an apartment). But Covid is different because if you get it, you then become a vector. You can hurt others just by being next to them. And since it can pass from a person who is asymptomatic, you'll never know that you're getting other people sick. Acting recklessly doesn't prove you're brave or macho. It's just makes everything worse.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask isn't showing compassion, that's just BS messaging created to induce compliance.  Every place you see high mask compliance you see high case(Positive Test) counts.  That should be clear to anyone that they don't work for preventing the spread of the virus.  Mask wearing is nothing more than religion, stop pushing yours upon other people.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>This statement near the end of this same article isn't very scientific wouldn't you say?</p>
<p>"<em>It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools,</em> <strong><em>they are also talismans</em></strong> <em>that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals.</em> <strong><em>Although such reactions may not be strictly logical,</em></strong> <em>we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis."</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>

<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>

<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>.

        <p>&rt; New England Journal of Medicine article</p>
<p>See rebuttal here:</p>
<p>&rt; The notion that universal masking is unnecessary, as proposed by Klompas et al. and shared by many alike is based on the assumption that sufficient social-distancing attenuates disease transmission and the risk is minimal despite exposure to SARS-CoV-2 given such distance is maintained [5]. We agree that in perfectly controlled experimental settings where physical distances are maintained, masking may only offer small additional benefits to prevent disease transmission. Nevertheless, in reality, when people come into close proximity with one other, for instance in confined spaces like elevators or public transport inside which adequate social distancing becomes impossible, masking can provide substantial and obvious benefits in preventing disease transmission [2,6].</p>
<p>&rt; In addition to protection against droplet and aerosol transmission, masking may also protect against transmission by the indirect contact route. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to survive in the environment for up to 72 hours [7]. Both health care workers and civilians can be exposed to surfaces contaminated by the virus and possibly carry viral particles to their mucous membranes, for instance, by rubbing and touching the eye, nose and mouth, which allows inoculation and infection by the SARS-CoV-2. We believe this problem can partially be alleviated by well-fitted masks properly worn, which not only form a physical barrier between hands and mucous membranes to deter their direct contact but also serve as a conspicuous reminder to refrain people from constantly touching their faces, so that transmission by such route can be reduced.</p>
<p>&rt; Zhang et al. further highlighted the importance of universal masking in flattening the COVID-19 curve [3]. Their data illustrated that aggressive implementation of mandatory mass masking in the initial epicentre of Wuhan by the Chinese government is the determinant in its rapid curve flattening compared to Italy and the US, the two other epicenters of outbreak, where a universal masking policy was not in place. Furthermore, the mathematical models in the study revealed that since the implementation of mandatory masking, it alone reduced the number of infections by over 78 000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66 000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. It is evident and beyond disputes that universal masking has a determinant role in flattening the curve and containing the outbreak. Alternative measures like social distancing, quarantine and isolation, while having their own values, as concluded by the study, are incapable of replacing the role of masks in effectively curbing COVID-19 contrary to the common belief.</p>
<p>&rt; Masking is usually contemplated as a talisman and a form of self-protection in this pandemic, which shields users from contracting COVID-19. Moreover, droplets and airborne aerosols at the scale of microns are major routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which are shed from infected individuals during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing. Latest measurements showed that intense coughs and sneezes could propel droplets &rt;20 feet while simultaneously generating thousands of aerosols capable of travelling even further [8]. Furthermore, increasing recent evidence indicates significant airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As a result, the 6-feet social distance recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is indeed inadequate to eliminate transmission [9], both in indoor settings where aerosols accumulate over time and outdoor environments where airflow currents transport them over long distances. Universal masking hence offers the advantage that not only healthy individuals but asymptomatic carriers are both masked. Masks form an effective barrier to minimize virus shed from infectious carriers to achieve source control so the protection for healthy citizens are maximized. Without universal masking, asymptomatic and silent carriers who continue shedding virus would greatly undermine the efforts to contain the outbreak. Universal masking is therefore an indispensable and synergistic measure to complement existing policies to effectively curb COVID-19.</p>

        <p>&rt;Lol, cool Lets break your rebuttal down.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"<em>The major routes of transmission of COVID-19 include droplets, airborne aerosols and fomites.</em> <strong><em>Current scientific evidence has unanimously concluded that masking is an effective means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission</em></strong> <em>[</em><a href="http://www.jogh.org/documents/issue202002/jogh-10-020383.htm#R2"><em>2</em></a><em>,</em><a href="http://www.jogh.org/documents/issue202002/jogh-10-020383.htm#R3"><em>3</em></a><em>]."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If this was true I wouldn't have any sources to provide that counter this assumption. Including this one <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks/">from the CDC itself. Study Finds Overwhelming Majority Of People Getting Coronavirus Wore Masks</a>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>"In addition to protection against droplet and aerosol transmission, masking may also protect against transmission by the indirect contact route. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to survive in the environment for up to 72 hours [</em><a href="http://www.jogh.org/documents/issue202002/jogh-10-020383.htm#R7"><em>7</em></a><em>]. Both health care workers and civilians can be exposed to surfaces contaminated by the virus and possibly carry viral particles to their mucous membranes, for instance, by rubbing and touching the eye, nose and mouth, which allows inoculation and infection by the SARS-CoV-2."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The interesting thing about this paragraph is it's failure to acknowledge the health authorities inconsistent message regarding means of transmission. For example  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove the “Technical Lead COVID-19” for WHO’s “Health Emergencies Programme” replied to a question about asymptomatic transmission:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward. What we really want to be focused on are the following of symptomatic cases…From the data that we have it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.”<strong>“It’s very rare.”</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Of course Fauci himself didn't help things when he stated in the beginning of all of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcTqW1Ngj4">that mask may help someone "feel better" but don't do much</a> in regards of protection.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>"Furthermore, the mathematical models in the study revealed that since the implementation of mandatory masking, it alone reduced the number of infections by over 78 000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66 000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. It is evident and beyond disputes that universal masking has a determinant role in flattening the curve and containing the outbreak."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Interesting they didn't include Spain which had strict masking mandates in place and cases still rose. New York at this point is a bad example due to the cases still rising not to mention the mass exodus that resulted after new control measures were put in place, which means if asymptomatic carriers exists on the scale the models project they will just spread the virus where ever the end up. So much for containment, lol. Of course they have been using computer models since the onset of all of this if you remember professor Neil Ferguson <a href="https://www.heritage.org/public-health/commentary/failures-influential-covid-19-model-used-justify-lockdowns">failed prediction of 2.2 million deaths</a> ." He didn't help his credibility by flouting his own recommendations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules">to have sex</a> which shows how serious he took the supposed deadliness of this disease.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>Zhang et al. further highlighted the importance of universal masking in flattening the COVID-19 curve [</em><a href="http://www.jogh.org/documents/issue202002/jogh-10-020383.htm#R3">3</a>]."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Well initially the goal was to flatten the curve, remember the shut down was only to last two weeks? It appears that has been abandoned.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Lets continue:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"<em>Masking is usually contemplated as a talisman and a form of self-protection in this pandemic, which shields users from contracting COVID-19. Moreover, droplets and airborne aerosols at the scale of microns are major routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which are shed from infected individuals during breathing, speaking, coughing and sneezing. Latest measurements showed that intense coughs and sneezes could propel droplets &rt;20 feet while simultaneously generating thousands of aerosols capable of travelling even further [</em><a href="http://www.jogh.org/documents/issue202002/jogh-10-020383.htm#R8"><em>8</em></a><em>]. Furthermore, increasing recent evidence indicates significant airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As a result, the 6-feet social distance recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is indeed inadequate to eliminate transmission [</em><a href="http://www.jogh.org/documents/issue202002/jogh-10-020383.htm#R9"><em>9</em></a><em>], both in indoor settings where aerosols accumulate over time and outdoor environments where airflow currents transport them over long distances.

Without universal masking, asymptomatic and silent carriers who continue shedding virus would greatly undermine the efforts to contain the outbreak. Universal masking is therefore an indispensable and synergistic measure to complement existing policies to effectively curb COVID-19."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Of course this paragraph contradicts the WHO's assessment of areosol transmission<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;From the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> : "<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"*</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Returning to your article:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>"Universal masking in public areas and confined spaces ought to become a new normal in the era of COVID-19 until safe and effective vaccines and treatments become widely available."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Again a blatant contradiction of what Fauci just said recently <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/15/social-distancing-masks-necessary-after-getting-vaccine-fauci/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter">in an interview with NY Post that these measures are indeed here to stay vaccine or not.</a></p>

<p>I appreciate you writing this all out and I want to assure you that I'm going to investigate and respond in good faith. I'm going to workout right now but I did read this first study and would like you to take note that in the discussion section, the authors note that many subjects were in close, prolonged contact covid-positive people such as family members and were also statistically more likely to have reported eating in restaurants, and obviously you can't wear a mask and eat simultaneously. I don't think you can look at this study alone as proof that people got COVID through the mask but perhaps that people overestimate how much they actually wear the mask.</p>

Cool thing is I did an odd job with my cousin power washing some siding on a house he was remodeling and using the extended brush was good therapy. I am 100% now and did my routine no problem.

<li>"These non-pharmaceutical measures should be recommended in crowded settings at the start of an influenza pandemic"</li>
<li>"Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently."
3."We found a significant reduction in the rate of ILI among participants randomized to the face mask and hand hygiene intervention during the latter half of this study, ranging from 35% to 51% when compared with a control group that did not use face masks."</li>
<li>"Our findings should not be interpreted to conclude that hand washing or face mask use are not potentially useful public health measure to prevent infections other than influenza"</li>

        <p>Sources? I noticed you didn't include those. This difference between what you and I post is the information isn't cherry picked from sources I only agree with. The sources I provide are actually advocates of wearing mask. What I highlighted was the contradicting message...in the same paper mind you. If you look closely the first is from the New England Journal of Medicine, a publication few sneeze or cough at, pun not intended. </p>
<p>Multiple pro-lockdown and pro-mask articles contradict themselves. This should result in these outlets getting ridiculed but since no one bothers to read them in full they are completely unaware of that fact.</p>

        <p>I've read through this a couple of times, and I've read through a couple of comments (which mainly consist of misogyny and calling people soy boys, even one dude complaining about condoms). I just want to say that I understand your viewpoint, you think this isn't as bad as everybody makes it out to be and there are worse things out there. But this is still a time of uncertainty and cautious where we should at least follow the basic lockdown rules if your country is in need of them. I don't want to assume you don't wear your mask but please do, as it does help and is only a mild inconvenience. You can also hang out with friends as long as it's under a gathering of 10 and in a wide area, such as a park or backyard. Thank you for reading if you did and wash your hands!</p>

        <p>I don't know about this poster, but I'm a college student and I've been compliant with these lockdowns for ten long, painful months since high school, including when I've had to go to the gym at my college. I didn't get to celebrate my high school graduation despite being in one of the most wide-open, rural regions of the country, and I've still managed to be compliant throughout all of this. I've suffocated for hours at the gym because of the "need" to wear masks 24/7, and I've still managed to be compliant throughout all of this. It has required every fathomable ounce of my patience to not abandon my masks outright.</p>
<p>I hope you come to realize how devastating and superstitious these lockdown proposals are and have been for the past year. I for one am a proponent for wearing face masks in the meantime, no matter how ineffective they may be, but I will NEVER support social distancing, not even if every last person on Earth is infected. The recent Black Lives Matter riots and massive, million-person rallies in support of both Joe Biden and Donald Trump (both of which apparently haven't caused any uptick in infections) have proven that social distancing is hardly effective, and pointless so long as masks are being worn, which they are, overwhelmingly so, in both instances.</p>
<p>I'll wear a stupid face mask all day if it means I get to hang out with friends, but you'll catch me dead before you'll catch me bringing a tape measure to a social event just to ensure that everybody's sufficiently spaced apart. Of course, isolating all day, wearing a mask to everything and anything, and bringing tape measures to every event to ensure people aren't too close to one another, is a safe way to live life, but it's hardly "living" at all. It's akin more to sadly and solemnly existing than anything else, and no amount of infection statistics and COVID death counts will ever prove otherwise or make that point any less relevant.</p>

        <p>Stores require you to put on a mask, or you don't get to come in and buy stuff.</p>
<p>Wow.  Sounds super similar.</p>
<p>But like girls, they don't all have the same requirements.</p>
<p>As for the jail time and fines?  What?</p>
<p>I've been in Oregon, California, and Washington in this last week and have seen nothing like that.</p>
<p>Literally 3 days ago I was in Weed, CA and there were stores with nobody wearing masks.   </p>
<p>Two weeks before that I was at a store on the redwood highway and nobody was wearing masks. I said "woah, no mask mandate here?" And the clerk said "there is, but they don't enforce it"</p>
<p>Where did you, a customer, get fined or thrown in jail at?</p>

        <p>No ones excluding you from traveling or purchasing essential items in the store for herpes are they? You aren't accused of spreading herpes just for being outside are you? Or for just standing there, right? Funny thing is herpes is actually highly contagious if exposed to fluids from an open sore.</p>
