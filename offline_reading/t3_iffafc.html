        <p>Sure, Sweden could have done better. They could have shielded those in nursing homes better, as they have openly admitted and taken responsibility for. Truth is nowhere could 100% protect nursing homes from any virus, but they could absolutely have done better and have had the courage to admit this. </p>
<p>There's always room for improvement in any public health measures, but doing better wouldn't have meant locking down. Reality is humans don't have the power to actually control a virus, so there were always going to be deaths. Yet even if they had only had 100 deaths, those angry at how they handled it without locking would still be screaming <strong><em>they could have done better</em></strong> because apparently no single supposed covid death is acceptable - but other actually preventable deaths are just fine by these people</p>

        <p>Lol at doing better by locking down. Belgium, a country with similar population, did lock down and still ended up with twice as many deaths as Sweden.</p>
