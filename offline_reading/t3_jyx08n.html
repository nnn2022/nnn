    <strong>I think its scary that most people aren't scared to have family over for holidays because they are scared of the virus but because they are scared of the government fines.</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone i talk to says they wish they could have there family over but they just can't risk it, not risk it in regards to the virus but because the government is fining $10k for the host and $750 to every person over the limit. This is tyranny, this is not what people want or else they would limit them themselves, people want to have family over and take the risk but government won't let them.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. From Europe here, we're on third lockdown since March and some people do hang out but because they have reached their limit and they are going crazy, I on the other hand don't have the courage since I don't have thousands of euros to pay the fine if someone decides to call the cops on me.
On one hand I'm angry that people are hanging out cause the government is saying we have police hour and all that shit because of such people that don't follow the rules and on the other hand I'm saying fuck the government, let them/us hang out and work! I'm having internal issues deciding what's right and wrong.</p>

        <p>The government is wrong, not the people.</p>
<p>I don't blame your peoples. The thing is, it is completely natural for humans to go out and socialize. Most people just can't stay cooped up in one place for a long time. The internet is also not a big replacement for actual social interactions eithers, even with the likes of facetime and such.</p>
<p>The government is actually trying to fight nature. Socializing is just nature for most people. To try to strip people of that is like trying to make a tiger into a vegan. It won't work.</p>

        <p>Don‚Äôt fall for these fascist tactics. RESIST EVERY attempt do not fall victim to the fear they are so desperately trying to instill. If you (in Europe) fall we all do. Please stand up against the police state       </p>
<p>It sounds crazy but the first thing they tried in March was fear propaganda. After the first FAILED lockdown most came to their senses and realized covid is far less scary then then the government wants us to believe.</p>
<p>Second phase was social and emotional ploys, let citizens police each other to ‚Äúmask up‚Äù and stay ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù. Using social media, influencers, fake news stories ‚ÄúI went to a party and now both my parents died from covid‚Äù....</p>
<p>Third phase is fines and finical citations. Don‚Äôt socialize or it will cost you. Report your neighbors. We have to lockdown a 2nd time because ‚Äúpeople are not complying‚Äù it‚Äôs all a lie and a ploy to turn each other against one another. Remember in the us ‚Äúdivided we concur and UNITED WE STAND‚Äù. Do not let them divide us and concur what we have left. </p>
<p>I will hypothesize the next phases will include forced ‚Äúquarantine camps‚Äù state checkpoints and state border closures within USA. Meaning no interstate travel and extreme police and military presence in our everyday life.</p>
<p>We all need to resist. Not give in otherwise they will continue to imprison us until it‚Äôs to late. Did anything get better for us after the first lockdown? After we were all forced to wear masks? After schools and jobs are all still closed or did the regime keep taking away our freedom a little bit more each day.....</p>

        <p>We‚Äôre having a get together with family. Not a big one but it would‚Äôve been the same size regardless of Covid or not. You never know if it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs last thanksgiving. Get together. Take pictures, laugh, enjoy the corny jokes and live. Living is more than staring at the wall in your house by yourself just to make sure your pulse stays active.</p>
