        <p>Reality is that there is no such thing as spreading any viral illness if you are asymptomatic. Symptoms like running nose, cough, sneezing, etc etc are how viruses spread. That is not an opinion, but observable fact for over 100 years. </p>
<p>Any and all talk about asymptomatic spread is nothing but fantasy.</p>

        <p>You can still spread a virus despite being asymptomatic.  With a respiratory virus spread via aerosol/droplet transmission, those asymptomatic can still produce a large enough viral load in droplets to infect another person with a weaker immune system or someone without any natural (antibodies from a previous infection) or artificial (vaccine or isolation level PPE) defense. Asymptomatic carriers typically have a higher "immune cell load" in addition to their viral load, which is how they stay asymptomatic, like in the case of Typhoid Mary. It does make transmission less likely, but not impossible.  This is also similar to the advancements in HIV treatments, which can bring viral loads down to levels low enough that they're virtually undetectable and the risk of transmission is extremely low... Or like me, born a healthy asymptomatic carrier of Epstein-Barr.</p>
<p>I work in healthcare, specifically with the elderly.  At this time, since our patients are so vulnerable, staff still tested twice a week regardless of vaccine status and we are required to wear surgical masks to decrease the likelihood of aerosol/droplet transmission to those who are frail and more likely to contract communicable diseases if exposed. In the last 6 months, we have had 3 staff members test positive for COVID-19 with no spread to our patients or other staff. Two had received their first dose of the vaccine and one was not vaccinated. All we 100% asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Look, I'm not an expert nor am I looking for an argument.  This is just what I know after years of working in healthcare. I am vaccinated and I haven't had any side effects other than 1 day of losing taste &amp; smell after my second dose. Right now, my area (Chicago) and employer don't require staff to be vaccinated but, isolation PPE must be worn while working if you are not.</p>
<p>You need to do what's right for you and your family. People should be critical of information when foundational disruptions happen and crisis mode takes over. We want the same things here-- the freedom to go about our lives safely. We just view the road to get there differently.  Hopefully, things will settle down soon and things can go back to being copasetic.</p>

        <p>LOL. Please read the articles on which the JHU summary is based.</p>
<p>The point about asymptomatic transmission in flu:</p>
<p>Based on a HEALTHCARE setting with limited ventilation and high concentration of immune-compromised patients. Always read the linked literature!</p>
<p>&rt;Evidence exists to support the transmission of influenza viruses by direct and indirect contact and by droplet and droplet nuclei (i.e., airborne) transmission. However, experimental studies involving humans are limited [37, 47], and the relative contribution of each mode of transmission remains unclear. Furthermore, the relative importance of airborne transmission in a setting of normal air exchange is unknown. The use of current droplet and contact precautions assumes placement of patients in rooms with standard air exchange rates [45] and not the stagnant air conditions reported in the study by Moser et al. [55]. Whether the use of negative-pressure rooms would result in a measurable decrease in the rate of transmission, compared with the use of droplet precautions in a private positive-pressure room with appropriate air exchange and ventilation, is unknown and may only be determined through carefully planned studies.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In addition to determining the clinical importance of airborne transmission, practical considerations also need to be taken into account. The limited number of beds in negative-pressure rooms may be quickly filled during community-wide influenza outbreaks, making implementation of airborne transmission precautions impractical. Determining the necessity of isolation of influenza-infected patients in negative-pressure rooms is important for planning by health care facilities for epidemic periods when health care systems may be inundated with influenza-related admissions. Nevertheless, given the uncertainty of the clinical importance of airborne transmission of influenza, use of negative-pressure rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza may be prudent if they are housed near severely immunocompromised persons. These precautions may also be advisable for initial admissions of persons infected with a newly emergent influenza A subtype with pandemic potential. Immunity in the general population to such a virus would be poor, and the viral inoculum necessary for infection may be low. An example would be the use of negative-pressure rooms for persons admitted to Hong Kong hospitals in 1997 with influenza A (H5N1) infections [57].<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Regardless of the isolation precautions used to prevent influenza acquired in health care settings, the primary preventive measure for influenza remains vaccination. Improved rates of vaccination of all persons at increased risk of influenza-related complications, their household contacts, and health care personnel, would substantially limit the introduction of influenza into health care facilities and impede person-to-person transmission when influenza is introduced.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>RSV paper:</p>
<p>Did you even read the methodology which shows differing rates of AsYmPtOmAtIc spread depending on the PCR-RT cycle threshold? I wonder where I've seen the same trick played on the public. The idea to prove someone's health state with a PCR  test is EXACTLY why we are in this mess!</p>

        <p>Generally, they are presymptomatic, as they DO develop symptoms later on if left unchecked.</p>
<p>And with HIV, for instance, the patient can reduce his/her viral load with a combination of meds and become nearly non-contagious.</p>

        <p>It certainly could be the case, but it‚Äôs ultimately irrelevant since the presymtomatic phase is obviously‚Ä¶..asymptomatic. So, if you identify a covid case that‚Äôs asymtomatic  at the time of testing, how would you ever know if they would go on to develop symptoms?</p>
