        <p>Semi-pro tip? Just wear a mask to get in the door. Take that ish off once inside. It’s easier for them to keep you out entirely than to forcibly remove you. </p>
<p>Also being forcibly removed makes better videos lol</p>
<p>Edit: also, try and remain as calm and composed as possible. Confrontation is hard for people. They will definitely overcompensate and bring harsh energy to it. Don’t match it. </p>
<p>After all, they are the ones being unreasonable, so let them come off that way by being overly aggressive towards you and you not reciprocating it</p>
<p>Edit 2: had a little run in at a Costco. I bought a hot dog and ate it while shopping. A manager approached me way too aggressively, instantly starts escalating the conversation, literally expecting and instigating a fight.</p>
<p>I calmly said I didn’t see any sign stating that, which is true, even if there were signs, they weren’t easily visible and that he didn’t need to speak to me that way.</p>
<p>‘If you can’t wear a mask I’m going to have to ask you to leave’</p>
<p>I then handed him my cart and said ‘can you restock this for me then’ and left</p>
<p>If they don’t want my business that’s fine, but making a customer that uncomfortable is wrong. Approaching a non confrontational customer with that level of aggression is wrong. </p>
<p>Fuck em</p>
<p>Also, I think we really need to start using the medical exemption. I feel like ADA laws would cover that quite well</p>

        <p>&rt; I feel like ADA laws would cover that quite well</p>
<p>That did not work for me, I lost my job since I legit can not wear a mask (PTSD from childhood.)  I asked to work from home, and did for 3 months, then they decided I was not able to preform all the essential functions of my job description and provided FMLA leave. After that expired, I was asked if I could do my essential job functions, which would require wearing a mask, I can not and I was let go.</p>
<p>I have talked with half dozen labor attorneys, they all say in this environment, I will not win.</p>
<p>My BOLI (Bureau of Labor and Industry) discrimination complaint is still winding its way through the bureaucracy.  I'm not too hopeful.  </p>
<p>Also, all the business needs to do is provide an accommodation, which can be as simple as ordering online.  ADA has been mostly useless in my* case.</p>

        <p>Intervention is necessary because mask mandates have systematically remained in place despite the government requirement being lifted. </p>
<p>The south had a similar problem during desegregation. Businesses lost the legal ability to segregate black customers, but systematically chose to fall back on the arbitrary “right to refuse service” which effectively kept segregation in place. Government intervention closing that loophole finally allowed desegregation to happen. </p>
<p>We need similar intervention to close the loophole for businesses requiring masks as a matter of company/corporate policy</p>

        <p>Agreed. The business always has the last day to who can and cannot shop there imo and if they want a mask mandate, that's their decision. There will always be an alternative that offers shopping without a mask, or if there isn't go to an online service that doesn't offer in house shopping and get your stuff there. At some point, businesses will likely notice it's more profitable to lift mask mandates in their store and the problem is solved</p>

        <p>People do so many irrational things over covid. The whole double and triple masking shit feels like something out of an onion article. In Ontario theres a stay at home order, they closed off all the "non-essential" shit in stores. Wanna buy clothes? Not for the next 4 weeks at minimum! The gift card section has been saran wrapped because everyone knows how much of a risk clothes and gift cards are for spreading covid.</p>

        <p>Also from Ontario. If you look at Fords instagram story it's literally laughable. It says how you should only leave the house for groceries, medical or exercise and is followed by a post about how garden centres are open... Where do potting soil and orchids fit into groceries, medical or exercise? </p>
<p>The real kicker is how golf courses are open... But you're not allowed to buy underwear. I guess the driving range is more essential than pants. It's so demented, I've literally stopped even trying to wrap my head around it.</p>
<p>These people are mental.</p>

        <p>While that may be the case, government intervention on any issue can set a bad precedent. I'd rather let businesses decide for themselves and let the market decide. I guarantee you those businesses that support masks will suddenly die out, which is what we want. Look at what happened with the recent NBA game, the non vax seats sold out almost instantaneously while the "vax only" seats hardly had anyone lmao!</p>

        <p>in texas we had a carnival come into town, a lot of masked people but also a good amount who didn’t wear masks, myself included. there was no confrontational situations to put them on, hardly any dirty looks. besides some of the people wearing masks it felt like a normal day before the scamdemic came into play. Hopefully as time goes on more people keep waking up and see that this ‘virus’ really isn’t as deadly as the “experts” say.</p>

        <p>Get a better mask. This is quite the test of humanity and their ability to empathize and make personal sacrifice for the greater good of others. And uncomfortable, itchy device that benefits you and everyone around you, or selfishness and righteousness. Its ridiculous this sub exists.</p>
<p>A small inconvenience to pay, to keep others safe till vacinations reach a critical mass. Even once they do though, I hope people realize the benefits of a mask for most sickness to allow yourself to go out and not spread to others whatever ails you.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying that we need to stick with covid politics and regulation. I’m saying that the “normal”we lived through before the pandemic was destroying the planet. Saying we are going back to normal would imply that all of that shit that was contributing to the ecocide will be started up again. Covid politics: booo! Previous normal: also booo! There needs to be some change to how we operate or we all gonna expire. That’s all I’m saying. 
Also I do know what it’s like to have it destroy life, grandparent dead, I’m out of work, mom working from
Home, dad dealing with slow business/production and chain of supply shutdown and major delays. Affects a lot of people, not just you.</p>

        <p>I think it does run regardless of covid, oil from the Middle East for example is humongous and we’ve seen what they can do, flooding the market with incredibly cheap oil for example to harm American oil producers. But at the same time, when the lockdowns began I heard dolphins returning to Venice canals, mountains visible from New Delhi which previously were blocked from smog. It was evidence like that which showed that as the lockdowns started, production decreased, giving the environment a little bit of a break. 
The masks pollution is a whole other thing which makes a likely pretty serious I mean personally I see em everywhere on the ground people throw them away like cigarette butts. Very sad. Seem them on beaches, in parks, streets, everywhere.</p>

        <p>Ouu yes. I agree with everything you said. Normal
In the sense of all that, restaurants, our freedoms, being able to fkn walk around outside for Christ’s sake, no bizarre masks and distancing and temperature checks. </p>
<p>OBVIOUSLY I want all that to come back. In that sense yes, we absolutely should return to normal, by this evening preferably. </p>
<p>My point was, that alongside all of the normality we lived through between 1900-2020 came with environmental destruction, which, call me crazy, doesn’t seem so swell!</p>
<p>And, I’m a huge advocate for nuclear energy, I think peoples fears of it are based on their idea of Chernobyl, which happened because it was 80s technology, you’d be crazy to think that the nuclear technology has not improved since then. </p>

        <p>u/Iro144 defined 'normal' as "before 2019". In my current knowledge, the Middle Ages took place before 2019. My point is that the things that are normal change as time goes by. At some point, women having the right to vote was considered not normal. At another point in time, leading a group of people based on anything else than physical prowess was not normal. I could go on and on, but I do hope you get what I'm trying to say.</p>

        <p>Yea the dinosaurs were also around before 2019 who fucking cares? It also was normal to be able to get on a plane quickly and fly somewhere before 9/11 now it take hours of "security" and searching of your items to go through, and by this next year if people like you don't gain a small amount of free thinking and logic it will probably require the covid passport</p>

        <p>You're basically agreeing with my point. You're saying that, because people were in danger, the norms changed. Would you rather have another plane crashing into a building full of people?</p>
