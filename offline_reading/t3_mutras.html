    <strong>Stasi-esque tactics</strong>
    <p><p>I never really create posts but this bothered me on many levels i just had to rant about it (beware, this is kinda long):  I was perusing the askNYC sub and some guy who lives on the Lower East Side was asking about how to deal with some noisy upstairs college aged neighbors who party loudly on weekends......a few people suggested he contact NYU (assuming the kids even go there) and get the kids in trouble with the school for having 30-40 person parties since that violates the schools Covid rules. The amount of upvotes and encouragement this suggestion received was ASTOUNDING (admittedly, its a clever idea, but evil) A little bit of context first.......</p>
<p>1) The OP said he/she was new to the area. The Lower East Side is well known as a younger, party filled, nightlife neighborhood and hes complaining about noise from tenants living there first</p>
<p>2) he stated he complained to his landlord who has not done anything</p>
<p>3) The OP was complaining about the noise mostly, not Covid issues</p>
<p>So the redditors that suggested he snitch the kids out to the school are totally fine with having a bunch of kids suspended/expelled from a school that they have paid/invested TENS of Thousands of dollars to go to (assuming it is in fact NYU), possibly cause them to lose scholarships and even threaten future job prospects bc they have parties at their own off campus apartment. And all of this is in response to how to handle a NOISE complaint in the loudest city in America!</p>
<p>This angers me even more as a native NYer bc its obviously a very left leaning city (thanks largely to transplants and rich Manhattanites who think they speak for all 8 million residents) who are TOTALLY fine with criminals being released without bail but want people who host parties hung from the rafters. Its insane. I wanted to ask if theyd call the cops or the jobs of neighbors who were POC if they were having parties that broke Covid "rules" bc that is a common talking point here (not calling police on POC for non violent things bc police escalate violence and a small offense will ruin a POC's life bc they can be arrested for minor stuff).....but they have NO issues doing this to a bunch of college kids. Is it me? Am I crazy for being tight about this???</p></p>
