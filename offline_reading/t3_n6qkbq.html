    <strong>Vaccine shedding is a psy-op</strong>
    <p><p>Something about the whole idea of vaccine shedding has been nagging at something in the back of my mind for a while. I think I figured out what it is.</p>
<p>Let’s start with what we <em>know.</em> We know that the <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">vaccine causes cytokine storms on exposure to the wild virus, liver damage, and prion disease</a>, as <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">there is no evidence to suggest any of these problems have been remedied in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine</a>. We know that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/these-colleges-now-say-covid-vaccines-will-be-required-for-fall-2021.html">the COVID vaccine is becoming compulsory to get a college education</a>. We know that <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/can-you-get-fired-if-you-dont-get-a-covid-vaccine-yes/ar-BB1dPIc5">you can be fired for refusing the COVID vaccine</a>. We know that <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/restaurantsandnews/here-s-a-list-of-free-stuff-you-can-get-with-your-covid-19-vaccine-card/ar-BB1fGR0x">you can get a boatload of free stuff if you’re vaccinated</a>. We know <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/vaccine-passports-are-coming-here-s-why-they-re-controversial/ar-BB1eBxWU">they’re going to make vaccine passports happen</a>. We know <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/ny-stadium-plan-would-separate-vaccinated-unvaccinated-people-at-baseball-games/ar-BB1gopX7">they currently want to separate the vaccinated and unvaccinated at crowded events</a>.</p>
<p>What does that tell you?</p>
<p>It tells you that they really, really want everyone to get vaccinated. They’ve even manipulated society to shame those who do not want the vaccine.</p>
<p>If this vaccine was communicable and “shed,” they would be a lot more casual about it. They would tell people that if you were vaccinated, you absolutely were immune, could ditch masks and social distancing, etc. There would be no talk of it being possible to get COVID after vaccination. After all, if the vaccine shed, all the government would have to do is let the vaccinated party and wait.</p>
<p>But they’re not doing that. Which means “shedding”—vaccinating others via contact with a vaccinated person—is a myth and psy-op.</p></p>

        <p>Well it’s not “shedding” and this isn’t a vaccine. These people are producing spike proteins which is the point of this jab. They want the rest of us to get sick even if we don’t have the jab. There are way too many instances for this to be a coincidence. I know not a single person who has had covid. I know two people who have been sick and have been around people with the jab (one had a miscarriage and one had “stomach flu” even though he hasn’t left his house in weeks due to the strict lockdown) and the only thing they’ve done differently is be around people with the jab.</p>

        <p>I think I wasn’t clear. I agree it’s not actually a vaccine, in that it provides immunity to a virus. My point is that a “vaccinated” person can’t “vaccinate” others—that is, they can’t cause another person’s body to start producing spike protein like theirs does. Exposure to the spike protein may make an unvaccinated person feel ill for a while, but because your body isn’t making any more, you wouldn’t be privy to the same problems as a “vaccinated” person.</p>

        <p>We don't really know that the vaxxed are spreading a spike protein, for sure, do we? All we know for sure is people are having strange health effects after being around the vaxxed. We really have no data on what's being transmitted, or how. Unless I missed some research somewhere?</p>

        <p>The evidence at this point is mostly anecdotal (it’s too new for a study to have been done), but it seems pretty common based on how often it’s reported, and it’s the only way so many unvaccinated people could realistically end up with the symptoms specific to being vaccinated and/or fertility changes.</p>

        <p>The evidence is anecdotal, but because there is so much of it coming from so many directions I'm paying attention to it. That has nothing to do with the causative agent of the changes to health we're seeing. It may be spike proteins, it may be something else. We just don't know yet.</p>

        <p>I have first hand experience from moving job to job at different restaurants and my cycle changes every time just being around a new group of women. So if the vaccine is screwing up women’s cycles, then the women around them could be affected in that sense I think.</p>

        <p>I think not. This is a well-documented phenomenon from way before COVID. It’s called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_synchrony">the McClintock effect</a>. If a vaccinated woman, whose cycle is artificially altered, spends a significant amount of time around an unvaccinated woman, the unvaccinated woman’s cycle could “sync up” with the vaccinated woman’s.</p>

        <p>The McClintock effect only refers to menstrual synchronization.  Unvaxxed women who have been in close proximity to the vaxxed are reporting extreme anomalies in their menstrual cycles. Clots the size of their fists. Miscarriages. 2 periods in one month, or menstruating for 20 days. 10 year olds menstruating, and women years past menopause suddenly menstruating again. </p>
<p>Those are not explainable by the McClintock effect.</p>

        <p>Ah, okay. I’m actually aware of those. I think I told someone else this, but I must not have been clear in my original post—when I say “shedding” I mean another person is vaccinated by being exposed to someone who received a shot. </p>
<p>I don’t deny it’s possible that there’s a good chance you’ll end up feeling ill and having a lot of the same general effects a vaccinated person would experience by being exposed to such individuals, but I don’t think it’s possible to “vaccinate” someone through that exposure. That is to say, their body won’t make the spike protein like a vaccinated person’s does—once they are away from vaccinated people, their symptoms will begin to improve, and the protein will be flushed out of their system.</p>
<p>That explanation would fit both the government’s actions (trying to get everyone to get the jab) and what we are observing (fertility changes, COVID symptoms, etc.) in the unvaccinated who spend time with the vaccinated.</p>

        <p>From the link you provided;</p>
<p><em>"After the initial studies, several papers were published reporting methodological flaws in studies reporting menstrual synchrony including McClintock's study. In addition, other studies were published that failed to find synchrony. The proposed mechanisms have also received scientific criticism. A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist."</em></p>
<p>I'm a woman and i can attest that I've never had any kind of cohesive menstrual synchronization with other women around me, no matter how long we have worked or lived together.</p>
<p>That doesnt mean that there isn't some kind of issue with vaccinated people affecting the health of the non vaccinated, but it's best not to recycle speculation from a 1971 study as if it's a indisputable fact.</p>

        <p>Any thoughts on the end of that article where it says synchronizing cycles likely do not exist? I also wonder (if it were true) why does the unvaccinated woman's cycle go to match that of the vaccinated, and not the other way around?

        <p>I think that it’s a phenomenon that happens to <em>some</em> women—for an example, another commenter said it never happened to her, no matter how long she lived with her friends, but a housemate of mine definitely did “sync up” with me at one point.</p>
<p>If this is indeed the McClintock effect we’re seeing, I think the unvaccinated women are matching the vaccinated women because the vaccinated women’s cycles have been externally altered by the vaccine; that is, they <em>can’t</em> have a normal cycle because they’re no longer physically capable of it.</p>
<p>There’s two other possibilities: one, we hear only about the unvaccinated women being affected because if a vaccinated women was “synced up” with her friends, she might not even notice any changes because her cycle follows her friend’s normal one.</p>
<p>The other is that the vaccinated shed <em>spike protein</em> but not <em>vaccine.</em> The spike protein is what causes the nasty side effects of the vaccine, and we know the vaccinated people’s bodies continually make those proteins. But once an unvaccinated person is no longer exposed to a vaccinated person’s shed proteins, they would begin to improve and go back to normal, as their body flushes out the proteins; they aren’t making any more of them, unlike the vaccinated person.</p>
<p>Or I could be completely wrong—this is only my opinion of what’s going on, after all. Nobody ever said I always have to be right 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>Not a sound argument. This ignores the fact you have to be in close proximity for prolonged periods of time to a vaccinated individual to experience the ill effects of shedding and not all shedding leads to transmission. It would still be in the best interests of elites to vaccinate the entire population as fast as possible, before everyone wakes up. </p>
<p>Further, Big Pharma suspects the vaxxes shed, as the Pfizer trial documents reveal, but are probably max vaxxing anyway because they either aren't sure it really does shed or realize that shedding is an ineffective means of transmission.</p>

        <p>&rt; After all, if the vaccine shed, all the government would have to do is let the vaccinated party and wait.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But they’re not doing that. Which means “shedding”—vaccinating others via contact with a vaccinated person—is a myth and psy-op.</p>
<p>I don't think the government is that smart. They've made countless health "mistakes" in the past.</p>
<p>Plus you're forgetting the number one motivator: profit. If the vaccine did shed and their sole goal was to get everyone vaxed, then yea you'd be on to something. But the primary goal is profit. More people getting the shot means more profit. That's why they are continuing to market it to people even though it sheds. There's also no evidence that this covid vaccine upon shedding will have the same effect on an unvaccinated person being exposed to these sheddings. So they want everyone vaxed just to make sure.</p>

        <p>Actually, their goal isn’t profit, at least not the way you’re thinking of it, <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">it’s power</a>. And if you think about it from that perspective, their goal <em>is</em> to get everyone vaccinated; the whole point of the vaccine is threefold: to create a dependency on them for booster shots (increasing their power <em>and</em> profit), to usher in vaccine passports, and to smoke out the “dissidents.”</p>
<p>It is an interesting take that the shot <em>could potentially</em> shed, but unfortunately, the documents released by Pfizer indicate that vaccine shedding is <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/"><em>definitely possible</em></a>, which, I suppose, is how the government is probably shooting themselves in the foot. </p>
<p>I think it’s fishy because if they’re so sure vaccinated people shed, then they wouldn’t be trying to coerce everybody to get a shot, and beyond that, it’s a weirdly specific piece of information for a large corporation that’s firmly on their side to disclose, especially when it could so clearly harm their ability to make a profit. It also is, coincidentally, the perfect piece of information to panic <em>our</em> side in an attempt to widen the divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated; the vaccinated are encouraged to virtue signal and shame the unvaccinated, while we are being groomed to cut ourselves off from the vaccinated out of fear.</p>
<p>I see where you’re coming from with your point that the government can be dumb from a health standpoint, and I know there are many cases of such stupidity in the past. However, I think we can all agree that this whole sham of a  pandemic was planned—and meticulously so. They even did a dry run with Event 201, and Bill Gates was hunting at the ploy to use vaccines for eugenics over a decade ago. While the government can be dumb, I don’t think they’re being dumb in this case. They know perfectly well what this vaccine does and doesn’t do, and every move they make regarding it is calculated to get them to their goal—government dependency and vaccine passports in the short term, and the Great Reset/Net Zero in the long term.</p>

        <p>okay then why are real people in this sub experiencing it? are you going to start censoring shedding posts? why is this mod post stickied? as someone who has absolutely experienced shedding effects, i would like to figure out what is going on (and not just menstrual issues either, though i've also experienced that and i live alone - nobody to sync with)</p>
<p>there is already proof that spike proteins damage lunge tissue at the very least. spike proteins are present in saliva, sperm, anus, breastmilk. pfizer's own guidelines for initial trials told men not to have sex or to wear a condom and they think the spike proteins might be spread through skin to skin contact.</p>
<p>much like some people have severe side effects to the vaccine while others have none, it could be that some individuals are more sensitive to the spike protein shedding than others. </p>
<p>like this sub is supposed to be against censorship. the fact that a mod has stickied this post makes me highly concerned. if you disagree with shedding posts, why you disagree. but the data is out there.</p>

        <p>I’ve said this to a couple other people, so I’m definitely getting the impression I wasn’t clear in my writing. When I said “shedding” as in “vaccinating others via contact with a vaccinated person,” I meant “causing someone who hasn’t gotten the jab to produce spike proteins in the manner a vaccinated person does.” </p>
<p>I am aware that many unvaccinated people feel ill or have changes in fertility after spending time with vaccinated people. I think the explanation that best fits the government’s actions and this observation is that the vaccinated do shed spike proteins, yes. But they don’t shed the <em>vaccine.</em> These unvaccinated people may feel ill for a while, but once their body has a chance to flush out the spike protein away from vaccinated people, they will begin to feel better.</p>
<p>Being around the vaccinated is likely no more dangerous than being around someone with COVID (which is about as dangerous as contracting the flu), unless, perhaps, you’re pregnant—but then again, the flu is much more dangerous to a pregnant woman than it is for the average person anyhow, so perhaps that assessment isn’t quite correct.</p>

        <p>where do you see people talking about shedding in reference to vaccine shedding? i'm pretty sure most people talking about "shedding" are talking about spike protein shedding. </p>
<p>what if the vaccinated shed spike proteins forever? spike proteins themselves can be damaging to multiple systems in the body.</p>

<p>The difference between if the vaccinated are shedding spike protein vs vaccine is that if it’s spike protein, people will improve once they are no longer in contact with the vaccinated, and it’s not so dire if most people are in contact with them—you might feel ill, but it will pass, as you’re not making any more spike protein, and what you do have in your system will be flushed out. If it’s the vaccine, you’re pretty much screwed—your body will begin to manufacture the spike protein, too.</p>

        <p>The self-spreading vaxxes that they've tried so far don't always reach to all corners of the desired target group. If one was trying to reach as many unvaxxed as possible with a self-spreading vaxx, one would try to get as many vaxxed as possible circulating among the unvaxxed.</p>

        <p>That isn’t quite the same thing. You can’t get HIV from breathing the same air or touching the arm of an infected person, yet you can contract it from blood, breast milk, or sexual contact; this, I think, could work the same way. Also, while I’m not sure if it matters, babies have much weaker, less durable immune systems than most older children and adults.</p>

        <p>I mean HIV isn't an airborne disease, but covid is.  I'm not sold on the idea of shedding, although I can imagine how it might happen, if possible.  I just don't see how enough of the spikes could escape to cause symptoms in another person unless it's somehow gained back the ability to reproduce... or unless it acts as an allergen, but the period symptoms would be weird for that, you'd think it'd be some kind of anaphylaxis.</p>

        <p>I think I said this in a reply to someone else, but the period symptoms can be explained by the McClintock effect—nothing to do with shedding, just plain old human biology. </p>
<p>But yeah, it is weird with the babies who died after drinking their mothers’ tainted milk. I don’t have a <em>certain</em> explanation for that, but it doesn’t seem like it would be entirely out of the realm of possibility that the vaccine could make people sick in a different way from the virus itself. And I would think becoming ill from being in close contact with vaccinated people does not necessarily imply you have been “vaccinated” yourself. It means you have been exposed to an agent their body manufactures, not that your body will begin manufacturing it, too.</p>

        <p>I don't agree with your thesis, though I understand why you proposed the idea. The psyops we have seen too many times are all widely publicized in the mainstream media, repeated ad infinitum on every channel (like those videos that show all the talking heads reading the same thing), and perpetuated by government officials.</p>
<p>The concern that there may be some kind of spreading of something by the vaxxed to the unvaxxed is being heavily censored. I don't know what's going on with that phenomenon of spreading, but I do know what a psyop looks like, and this does not seem to be one to me because it's being so dismissed by the MSM.</p>

        <p>Actually, there <em>was</em> a psy-op that looked just like this—it was the COVID virus, back in January to March of 2020. The COVID virus turned out to be about as dangerous as the flu (actually .02% less, but that’s a story for another day), yet in the beginning, news from Wuhan, invariably depicting lots of deaths, overflowing hospitals and crematoriums, etc. was heavily censored, and, in fact, one of the main subs here on reddit that was talking about this “information the government doesn’t want you to know” (r/Wuhan_Flu) was quarantined over it.</p>
<p>The point of all that was to preemptively make people like us feel like we knew things the government was trying to hide for its own nefarious ends, and at the same time make us afraid of the very thing that they wanted <em>everyone</em> to be afraid of. They just knew they had to use a different type of technique on the people who wouldn’t be fooled by the msm reports later on down the road.</p>
<p>This latest thing on vaccine shedding reads to me the same exact way the virus did in January 2020.</p>

        <p>OK, fair enough. But we know the goals of the whispered-rollout covid1984 scam. What do you suppose the goals of a vaxxed harming the unvaxxed psyop would be? Just more divisiveness?</p>

        <p>Yep—basically, they don’t want the vaccinated to view the unvaccinated as anything more or less than an unhinged, conspiracy theory-riddled enemy that needs to be stopped. They know the unvaccinated aren’t going to care about their vaccination status in being with friends, going to events, etc., where they might find vaccinated people who can be convinced to their views—that’s kind of the whole point of being against the new normal, after all. So they’re trying to make us too afraid of the vaccinated people to be around them, further segregating us into our two categories.</p>

        <p>From one perspective that may be true (may be what they are trying). However we tinfoil hat people seem to be far less subject to <em>irrational</em> fears than the average bear. I don't personally believe this would be a very good psyop, if it was one. Additionally, you're not accounting for the online transmission of information, where we are still in contact with many vaxxed and exchanging information with them all the time at zero (speculative) risk to ourselves. I just don't buy the idea that people clever enough to carefully plot out covid1984 would think they could stop information going between vaxxed and unvaxxed people *just by trying to make the unvaxxed fear the vaxxed.</p>

        <p>They are making the unvaccinated fear the vaccinated, and making the vaccinated hate and discredit the unvaccinated. You can't transmit information to someone who literally thinks you're crazy and hates your guts, internet or no. Just think about how irrationally angry and hateful a lot of these vaxxers get when you try to confront their opinions, and how steadfastly many believe they're right even when presented with evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>They've already got the vaccinated blindly hating us; all they need now is for us to fear the vaccinated too much to try to sit down with them and have a real conversation (nobody convinces anyone of anything on the internet, I've noticed, as I'm sure you and many others have, too--in fact, many people are the worst versions of themselves here). If this works the way they want it to, they'll have two sides, where one side hates the other, and that latter side fears the former. In a society like that, both sides would have stopped mixing with one another, and would be unsympathetic to each other, so it would be easy for the government to stomp out "dissidence" via the vaccinated reporting on all the Jews--oops, I mean unvaccinated, selfish bigots (or whatever they decide to call us next)--out there.</p>
