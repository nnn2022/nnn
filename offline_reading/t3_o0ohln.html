    <strong>Californians in my town are still wearing masks even though the mask mandate got lifted.</strong>
    <p><p>Did errands at like 3 stores today that didn't have mask required signs outside and nobody bothered me when I entered without one but basically everybody else had a mask on. </p>
<p>Keep in mind this is California so basically everyone here had been vaccinated but they're still all wearing their compliance masks to own Drumpf le epic style. These people are fucking insane</p>
<p>Whatever I guess it's fine as long as nobody bothers me while I try to live a normal life I guess but it's bizarre how so many people have basically been Pavlov'd into wearing obedience masks even after the governor lifted the mandate today</p></p>

        <p>I've seen so many people on reddit alone stating they'll continue wearing masks just so they're not mistaken as republicans. It would be funny if it weren't so sad. How can you even say or type that without having even the slightest realization of how ridiculous you sound?</p>

        <p>This weird American culture war has to end. All it does it tribalize and polarize our country. We all have disagreements but at the end of the day we're one nation and we have to learn to live with each other. I can't stand all this meaningless division. </p>
<p>I don't like wearing masks but it's not a part of my personal or political identity or anything. I only post about it here because anywhere else on Reddit would just call me a racist nazi Trump supporter Russian bot and completely dismiss what I have to say out of hand. Which is super bizarre because I'm not a right wing person anyways but that shouldn't even matter, we should judge statements by their validity, not by who is saying it.</p>
<p>Why do people have to make everything political? Not everything has to be some life-or-death struggle for the survival of the nation or whatever.</p>

        <p>Yeah man I hear you loud and clear and I agree whole heartedly. I can only assume this is a mindset that is pushed by media, whether it be MSM or just social media echo chambers. It causes so much division. </p>
<p>People are being taught that anyone who disagrees with you is an enemy and that you're a national hero for wearing a mask. It conflates these two ideas and makes it so much more aggressive. Rather than a disagreement of government policy, it's a fight against evil. </p>
<p>These people have no real personality besides the ones the media they consume give them. It's tiring to watch the world regress like this.</p>

        <p>their brains got completely broken by Trump (conservatives before them got their brains broken by Barry O)</p>
<p>the media did a number on everyone. the outrage fire generates clicks and ratings, which necessitates more outrage to feed the fire. people's brains feel like they are constantly under attack, which causes them to lash out at anything outside the doctrine of the people who are keeping them safe and "informed".</p>
<p>it takes advantage of the way our brains are wired, it is morally reprehensible. very few people are able to step back and see what's happening.</p>

        <p>What I see locally in CA is all the vaccinated doomers taking to social media to proudly announce that they will still social distance and wear a mask because they don’t trust the unvaccinated to wear a mask and “people are dirty”. These are the same sheep who said they would go outside again and stop wearing a mask when the vaccine was here. They have been trained to dutifully move their own goalposts.</p>

        <p>It’s very easy to become homeless in California due to the cost of living and houses get bought up immediately by corporations.once someone is homeless they can’t dig out in a lot of cases and turn to alcohol and drugs to cope and go crazy no one gives a shit politicians speak i of it for elections but that’s it</p>

        <p>With the homeless situation, it’s the same shit as COVID. They are all a bunch of morally superior virtue signalers. They have plenty to say on social media but that’s the extent of how much they actually care. They do nothing to help solve the problem. They vote in the same tired incompetent politicians who only make the problem worse. They truly don’t care as long as the homeless aren’t too close to their homes. There are homeless encampments all over my city. God forbid someone complain because a homeless addict is walking down the block on trash day taking recyclables out of people’s bins &amp; leaving behind a mess. The bleeding hearts will rip you a new asshole, tell you once your bin is on the curb it’s fair game and that you should put your cans and bottles in a separate bag to make it easier for the poor bums! But the second a homeless shelter is planned for their neighborhood? NIMBY in full force. They freak out because OMG it’s too close to the schools. There are children and families here!! I kid you not. My city just built a huge homeless center for FAMILIES and the bleeding hearts in the area it is in lost their shit because they can’t have “those people” in their neighborhood. And again these are the same people who attack everyone else who dares to say something negative about the encampments and the problems the people living in them cause in their neighborhoods!</p>

        <p>if you go on r losangeles people post all the time stories of them getting robbed/attacked/pissed on/etc by homeless people, and any responses that insult or degrade these violent "unhoused" schizos are downvoted and buried. its pretty blatant virtue signalling, guarantee not a single one of them would get within half a block of a tent city before getting the fuck out of there. its a literal mecca of insanity out here and the mask thing just further fuels their lust for righteousness</p>

        <p>This. They claim “wearing a mask or not isn’t political” yet their actions speak otherwise. They wear masks after the mandates have dropped because they don’t wanna be viewed as a Republican and be harassed or attacked for such. Me thinks that would make mask wearing, “political.” On both sides and on all spectrums.</p>

        <p>I’d rather they continue to wear masks. They’ll self-identify as a moron and I can interact with them as such. At least those not wearing a mask I can presume have some modicum of common sense. </p>
<p>It’s kind of like when I see a young child. I certainly treat and interact with a young child much differently than I do a competent coworker. Those still wearing the masks fall into the young child category.</p>

        <p>Went to a Home Depot in NorCal last week and saw 2 old people screaming at each other because one wasn’t wearing a mask! Found out from an employee the other day that HD stopped requiring masks awhile ago and even though as of last week the state still mandated masks, HD stores were NOT enforcing it. Which explains why the employee in the middle of the fight didn’t say anything.</p>

        <p>I have no issues with this “No mask mandate” rule because it’s how it always should have been: Up to the individual.</p>
<p>I know people will scream “But you’ll spread the plague!” Look, if you practice proper hygiene you’re safe and if you want to wear masks or use face shields go right ahead but remember: You catch more flies with honey than vinegar. “Voluntary” is the honey and “Mandatory” is the vinegar.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's amazing how courteous and caring I can be towards others - even if I don't agree with their fears - I'm willing to accommodate them because it's not a big deal.</p>
<p>That all changed and my heart went cold when they decided to coerce me into wearing a Mask to buy/sell/work/travel/eat and called me all sorts of hateful names and accusing me of being a 'superspreader', 'grandma killer' , 'selfish' and all sorts of encounters where they were perfectly happy to trample on my rights, and even get mouthy and threatening about it.</p>

        <p>I was the same. At first I was sympathetic and respectful to those who wished to wear masks before the mandate. Their body their choice. I still followed all the health protocols like hand sanitizer, social distancing, reduced trips in public, etc. But then there was a push to make masks mandatory in public places and businesses. Yet again I respected these places and just avoided them and continued frequenting places where masks were optional. I did this for several months and it was fine. Then the mask mandate was enacted in all indoor places with threat of fines. Now here I am now stuck wearing one for the unforseeable future because if I don't wear it I can lose my job, get fined and face ridicule/harrassment from people. I am now bitter from all this nonsense that I could give less of a shit for these pro-mask people. They forced their fear/beliefs on those who just want the freedom of choice and I will never view a lot of these people the same way ever again.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the response. Your story mirrors my own. As a barely self-employed person now with all the restrictions that gutted my income, I am able to avoid the dreaded Mask in a workplace, but know people who do, they hate it and is a personal Hell for them, and of course I must don the blasted Mask if I want to eat or renew licenses and stuff. It's even worse now that everyone has normalized it and don't seem to be upset at all, smiling and laughing and how do you do's all through a Mask like it's normal now.. Ugghh</p>

        <p>Also consider that at this point anyone who gets sick has made the choice to not get the vaccine for covid so the responsibility is totally on them for not getting vaccinated. Like 75% of California has gotten the shot, including myself who got it the first day I was eligible. We should've reopened fully a long time ago</p>

        <p>It’s never been about getting the vaccine, as that is just the new carrot on a stick. We’re already seeing news that “OMG Indian variant” which is OK to say because India isn’t a major market that we’re looking to exploit for money because we’re already exploiting them for cheap labor.</p>

        <p>I am in CA. Just watched, from my kitchen window, a woman walking her dog pass by and she was wearing a mask! It’s a beautiful warm day and there is no one else around yet she’s wearing a mask outside! I am about to go to Target and don’t plan on wearing a mask. I went to the mall yesterday and saw a couple people either maskless or with their mask pulled down to their chin.</p>

        <p>Here in Michigan too. I lost the mask several months ago because it was apparent that it was stupid and pointless. Lots of dirty looks and a few comments. 
Anyway, I figured that would stop once masks became optional a few weeks ago. Nope. Still idiots out running in 85 degree heat alone with a f-ing mask, dirty looks at stores, and, the worst, kids outside riding bikes and playing in masks.  We e become a nation of scared kids warding off the monsters under the bed with a security blanket.</p>

        <p>I'm in South Florida. A mask mandate was never installed statewide in this state. And my county's local mask mandate was overriden by the governor at some point in October.</p>
<p>Yet mask usage tends to be about 90% indoors here.</p>

        <p>False. Infrared technology can still get information on  your face through your mask, and biometrics has advanced enough that all they need is your upper face anyway, amongst other data points to identify you if they really wanted to.</p>

In NYC, mask mandates lifted a month ago and still, depending on the area, more than half are wearing their mask OUTSIDE 🤷‍♂️. Sad, but traveled to different cities in VA the past couple weekends and never wore a mask once.</p>
