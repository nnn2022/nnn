    <strong>How did the Great Barrington Declaration get so hated?</strong>
    <p><p>I was browsing through the website and I noticed that a lot of the signatories are high-ranked professors, sometimes even in fields such as immunology or epidemiology at respected universities. How is it possible that this gets called hogwash and ignored? Why would these professionals devote their time and THEIR NAME to this if it was just bullshit? </p>
<p>Are these people forever burned? Will they get hunted out of their jobs?</p></p>

<p>The same people shrieking at us to tRuSt ThE eXpErTs/ScIeNcE don't mean <em>those</em> experts, you see. It's just like with ~~global cooling~~ ~~global warming~~ anthropogenic climate change. There are actually plenty of dissdents in the field.</p>
<p>&rt;Are these people forever burned? Will they get hunted out of their jobs?</p>
<p>Probably yeah. People get "cancelled" in social media driven Maoist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session">struggle sessions</a> over un-PC jokes all the time. I can only imagine what will happen to them for actually endangering TPTB's narrative of tRuSt ThE eXpErTs/ScIeNcE.</p>

        <p>I admire them. And then I wonder why anybody would risk it. Because sadly, it's not like it's making any difference. </p>
<p>Maybe, after our society collapses and gets rebuild, maybe then these people will be remembered as brave.</p>

        <p>Most people wouldn't risk it.. that's why censorship works.. yes some people will speak out against it and then as the punishments for speaking out against the Democrat narrative would get increasingly severe less and less people would speak out against it.</p>

        <p>They allowed the public to sign it, and a few people signed it as a joke with meme names and fake credentials, so it lost credibility. there Should have been some moderation, at least- there’s nothing wrong with letting real people sign it if they’re not making memes</p>

<p>Great question... they are "hated" because they are controlled opposition. They say great things, but then will spin us into la-la land.</p>

        <p>I assume Bill Gates is somehow involved in this restructuring? It just so happens that the think tank that put out the GBD obtains a significant portion of its funding from an investment in Microsoft - so wouldn’t it be in their best interest financially to support whatever restructuring is being planned?</p>

        <p>That wasn’t my point. I’m just saying that you can’t logically be both pro-GBD and anti-Gates because the group that funded the GBD is compromised due to their financial involvement with Microsoft. I know that Gates is (supposedly) no longer involved with the company but the AIER’s investment in it stretches back to his tenure.</p>
<p>Also what you’re describing isn’t socialism. People tend to misunderstand what socialists mean when they talk about abolishing private property. What you’re talking about - material possessions like a house, car, etc. - are what socialists would call personal property. It has never been the goal of socialism to get rid of those things. For socialists, abolishing private property means having the tools we use to make things - energy &amp; manufacturing industries, infrastructure - be publicly owned and accountable. That’s something very different from the scenario you’re proposing.</p>

        <p>Ah, the sweet sounds of the naive youth.</p>
<p>Why can't one be both pro GBD and anti-Gates?  With that logic, one must be anti-computers, because they use Microsoft.</p>
<p>iTs NoT rEaL sOcIaLiSm.  Of course it is.  You're just choosing the call it a different name.  Yes, our property and possessions will eventually be taken from us.  <em>That's what this is.</em>  It won't happen overnight, but this is where it is going.  I would love to be youthful and naive again but...  No.  It's pretty obvious at this point.</p>

        <p>First of all, there’s a good chance I’m older than you (although maybe not; judging by the quality of your memes there’s probably a pretty sizable boomer population on this sub).</p>
<p>Second, your analogy just doesn’t track, sorry. Investing tens of thousands of dollars (probably more) in a company is the same as using one of the computers they make? What? All I’m trying to point out here is, to reiterate, the group that funded the GBD has a significant, vested financial interest in the success of Gates/Microsoft. Make of that what you will, but it should at least be considered in any intellectually honest assessment of the GBD.</p>
<p>Re. Socialism: you can try to shimmy your way around them, but there are established definitions for these categories. Look up ‘socialism’ in any dictionary and you’ll see something along the lines of: ‘public ownership of property and the control of the means of production by the working class’. That is far different from what a world after ‘the great reset’ would look like - that could be defined as ‘the sole ownership of property/means of production by a tiny elite class’.</p>
<p>I’m not even disagreeing with you, fundamentally, that there are people out there, like Gates and Schwab, who are working on some kind of ‘great reset’. But I think it’s important to understand that, while they wield a lot of power, the trajectory of history has never been determined solely by the will of a few ideologues; social, political, and economic forces, as totalities, are too complex to be directed without tons of unforeseen consequences, etc. We need to look at the problem of how power operates in a more nuanced and analytical way if we hope to realistically oppose it, we can’t succumb to black-and-white, over-emotional thinking.</p>

        <p>If you are worried about that tenuous connection between Microsoft and GBD, then imagine how you must feel about everything the CDC, the WHO, and the main stream media says.</p>
<p>Socialism</p>
<p>"Public ownership of property".  This is precisely what the Great Reset is talking about.  "You will own nothing, and you will be happy.".  Let's literally their stated plan.</p>
<p>"Control of the means of production by the working class".  I don't know if you've noticed how powerful unions are these days, but I sure have.  </p>
<p>Like, sure.  We're not there yet, but that's exactly where this is going.  You've just proven it yourself.</p>

        <p>I don’t have the time to get too deep into the weeds here.</p>
<p>‘You’ll own nothing and be happy’ - the implication here is that in their perfect world, private companies will be the sole owners of physical necessities like housing, transportation, etc., and will lease them, for profit obviously, on an as-needed basis. That’s literally the opposite of public ownership.</p>
<p>And I don’t know what point you’re trying to make about unions. Are you saying they’re weak to nonexistent these days? If so I agree. If you’re trying to argue the opposite you need to pull your head out of the sand.</p>

        <p>How? Well, its a longer process.</p>
<p>But lets start with climate-change, within the framework of climate-change media pushed the agenda of science denialism. Meaning, everyone who disagreed with the narrative was labeled science-denier / climate-change-denier. These people have, without even considering their arguments, been framed to be all kind of nutjobs.</p>
<p>As a result, society took the bait and has now a very strong opinion on people who deviate from mainstream perspectives. Effectively framing everyone who takes a different stance on prominent societal issues (for example: gender, climate, covid) as unable of participating in "normal" society.</p>
<p>Once you established such a framework, things become easy. You have a body of trusted persons &amp; institutions (f.e. Faucci, CDC &amp; WHO), saying X. Once the media has published that X was said, it becomes public opinion. Once it became public opinion, any argument against it is automatically a denier UNLESS the afformentioned bodies agree with it.</p>
<p>Thats why someone like Dr. Drosten can at first say Masks dont work. Then later shift to Masks have to be mandatory. Whereas everyone disagreeing, no matter at what point, will be consider a denier of truth and put into a box with everyone else who has been framed "bad" in the past.</p>
<p>I believe there stil is a glimmer of hope to change things. But, if that doesnt happen, then yes, they are all burned and will either have to publicly change their minds or be kicked out of their jobs.</p>
<p>The sad reality is, people dont even consider why someone would risk that. Even now, where a lot of "alternative" people are facing severe consequences (for example in germany: we have media being censored, state officials getting demoted, doctors loosing their licenses, lawyers and organisations having their bank accounts canceled, even a judge being under investigation  for ruling against the corona policies....) most people believe stuff like: "Well, they are opportunists" as those people are completely unaware of the consequences. Even if you explain them those consequences and that there is little to win, but much to lose by taking that position, they will find a way of bad mouthing: "Well, they deserve that...".</p>
<p>Basically people are completely buying into the thought that "Everyone who disagrees just the slightest with "state-science" is a bad person and deserves to be miserable." :(</p>

        <p>I do think that only scientists in a somewhat privileged position can associate with the GBD. They are either very confident and don't doubt their ability to get a job, or very smart and valuable to their own workplace that they feel secure enough to express their views. There are also a lot of those who sign on the advice of mentors and employers who are maybe being a bit naïve about what it could mean for their futures. However, I do think that as more time passes, especially once the media hype around COVID dies down, there will be more time to scrutinize the arguments of both sides, and those that are more holistic like GBD should win. Arguments in support of general lockdowns are narrow, and consider only the evidence in support, and none of the evidence against. This is why, even if the GBD is not the 'best' solution (probably just having a better health infrastructure and sick pay and leave policies would have been better, but that would have required long term thinking years ago), it should still sweeten over time.</p>

        <p>A lot of people have been desperate to get out of going to a workplace, and the pandemic was their opportunity to just stay at home all the time. Anyone who was a threat to that was quickly shamed and shouted down. </p>
<p>I dont have a problem with wanting to work from home, I just wish these people hadn't insisted that absolutely everyone be included against their will. There's no reason we all couldn't have just chosen what we prefer.</p>
