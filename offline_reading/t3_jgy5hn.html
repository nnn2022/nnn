        <p>It seems the fetish is on this sub reddit. Nobody says masks are a panacea. They are the simplest cheapest tool to reduce the spread and yet you have people so upset that they are being mandated.</p>
<p>The government forces you to do a million things a day. You must follow the law, stop at a red light, bring ID when flying, put your luggage through the scanner... Why is a cloth mask such a big deal?</p>

        <p>I agree with you on the TSA &amp; airline security- after 9/11 the surveillance state grew dangerously. But I was born a few months after the Patriot Act passed and there’s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>But red lights and seat belts protect us from car accidents, which are very deadly. Everyone agrees that car safety saves lives. COVID has a 99.97% survival rate for my age group. Fauci said on 60 minutes that masks do not work. And also, mandating masks is a slippery slope that I fear leads to forced vaccination, medical passports, and a shift towards totalitarianism.</p>

        <p>The head of the CDC said masks are better than vaccines.</p>
<p>Masks are dumb, and have NO basis in science. If people want to wear them, sure. Go knock yourself out. Mandating them? When previous to July of this year we knew they were next to worthless? Get out of here.</p>
<p>They do not stop any kind of spread or do anything. LA had a mask mandate since April. Everyone complies. EVERYONE. Data doesn't add up.</p>
<p>This thing has an IFR of roughly 0.13-0.25%. Flu-esque, highly segregated by age. We are destroying society for it. Destroying human interaction. There will be nothing left. Masks, if they worked - okay, why isn't everything 100% back to normal? Because there is no intent to do so.</p>
<p>(Also, I can't fucking breathe in them and have passed out, but who cares, #staythefuckhomeforever.)</p>

        <p>Mask mandate is one thing, whether ppl folow it is another. Forget the CDC, i dont take them seriously either but their comments don't devalue mask use.</p>
<p>Masks are not scientific? Its a barrier for your breath droplets. It reduces spread. Just reduces, not stops or solves the virus. Thats all. No grandiose claims, just PROVEN effectiveness at reducing spread when adoption is high and usage correct. </p>
<p>Whether society should remain shut down is also separate from the issue of whether masks work.</p>

        <p>I do not want the government didn't force me to do anything I do not consent to.  I consent to traffic laws, I do not consent to wearing a mask which when paired with my bad allergies makes it very hard for me to breath, to "protect" me from a virus that has a 0.14% death rate, and a much much lower death rate amongst people my age.</p>

        <p>My state has more covid today than in April, after six months of mask mandate. </p>
<p>Not only do they not work, the evidence now shows they actively accelerate spread. The experiment has failed. The only thing dumber than wearing a mask in the first place is continuing to wear one.</p>

        <p>Where is the strict evidence they ACCELERATE spread? Other than you saying "we have had 6 months of the mandate but we have more cases now". That just means people don't follow the rules, or they wear masks in public but then go do risky shit like dine indoors, have parties, etc etc. Show me the studies where they describe a MECHANISM by which masks make infection rates worse. </p>
<p>I live in Toronto, Canada - we have more COVID now than ever. We are also fairly good about wearing masks indoors (its mandated). That doesn't mean masks don't work. It means that like most other places, we could not stay locked down forever, so we have banned things like indoor dining, clubs, bars, and made bylaws for private gatherings (which nobody follows, I hear parties in my building every week).</p>
<p>Schools are open and I think small children do not need to wear masks, which means you have a huge vector for infection and spread that is happening every single day. You have plenty of places where people don't wear masks to work. My building is covered by the mask mandate but none of the concierges wear them. It's stupid. I am sure there are plenty of small business workplaces that are lax about the mask requirements too. </p>
<p>All of this is to say that there is a difference between making a rule about masks and people following it + the other rules in place for COVID. A mask can be 99% effective but if you host big parties indoors on the weekends then you cannot turn around and say well masks don't work, I wear one to work and on the bus and I was still infected. It matters what people do in the private spaces of society.</p>
<p>The fact that you are so passionate about calling mask wearing dumb makes me think you have some serious issues, because nobody would be so vehemently against something so innocuous (its a cloth covering) that is actually proven to WORK. Like you are both wrong about its effectiveness, and are really worked up about something that is such a minor inconvenience. I am really glad I am not an American.</p>

<p>You are doing a rain dance  in the streets, getting frustrated that it isn't raining, and concluding that the only explanation must be that other people aren't doing  the dance with  you.</p>
<p>Masks don't work,  lockdown doesn't work, the only thing  dumber than trying them in the first place is continuing the failed experiment a second time. </p>

        <p>I find it funny you discuss logical fallacies when you are stomping through the mud in your own.</p>
<p>Case numbers is not only affected by the presence of a mask law and its adoption in public places. The virus does not only transmit in public places. And not all public places are even mandated for them - I already said schools are full of kids not wearing them, and each kid cannot be fully separated indoors from the others, so the virus will spread from kid to kid, who takes it home to mom and dad. And mom and dad might wear a mask all day to work, but then they'll get home and have their friends over, who will also get infected. This is my last reply, I dont know how I found this stupid subreddit or why I am arguing with peopel who are so dishonest in their supposed intellect that they will run their head through a wall before actually reading what they write and thinking about the issue at hand.</p>
<p>I really hope you don't have to learn the hard way, when you or a loved one gets the virus and you realize how fucking stupid you are. Yeah 98% of people or whatever recover from the disease, but go look up the THOUSANDS of people who after 6 months still cannto walk up the stairs without being exhausted, who have neurolgoical issues, lung scarring, heart issues, etc etc. Survival rate is not a full recovery rate. Gluck to you.</p>

        <p>Masks are designed to be used once in a controlled sterilized environment aka a surgery room. If you touch your mask, put it in your pocket, on the table, wear it for three days, drop it, wear it again, it does fuck all at stopping the virus. </p>

        <p>I mean a brief glance at some of those papers reveals the glaring issue that most of those studies looked at HCWs wearing them, when the point is that wearing a mask catches some proportion of the water droplets from YOUR mouth and prevents them from being expelled out into the air in front of you. So your mask protects me and mine protects you.</p>
<p>Another point is that there is early evidence that masks help reduce the viral load of initial infection which seems to correlate strongly with the severity of ensuing disease - i.e. if you are infected with less viral particles initially, you have less severe disease course. </p>
<p>And while I won't pretend to know how rigorous all those studies listed in your link are, I do know that Nature is among the most respected in the world and I think they give a very fair and honest review here:</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02801-8</p>
<p>The evidence is overwhelming that masks help. If they are less effective than we think that's okay, but even your point about peoples poor habits with touching them and stuff still doesn't change the fact that if everyone wears them, infected persons are breathing less viral particles out in front of them. If non-infected people do not use them correctl, yes they put themselves at higher risk of infection. But thats up to each person if they want to protect themselves. The mask mandate is so that we protect each other. And it seems THAT is the real sticking point with anti-maskers, they don't want to be forced to protect others. They want to live in a society when theres murderers comign to get them and they need the police's protection, they want to be secure with their private property, but when an infectious disease comes in and kills 200,000 americans in 6 months, now suddenly wearing a mask in public places to protect your fellow neighbour from the disease you might be carrying is an infringement too far.</p>

        <p>There isnt "overwhelming evidence". At best the evidence is contradictory. </p>
<p>The point of "anti maskers" like me is that we dont want to be forces wearing a mask for a virus with a survival rate of 99.7 %. A virus in which the overwhelming majority of fatalities had other health issues. A virus that is slightly worse than the flu. A virus for which the response was absolutely disproportionate.</p>
<p>The flu, cancer, diabetes and many other illnesses take as much lives each year. Why arent we shutting down the economy, ruining our lives and mental health for them too? Why is this virus more "important" than them?</p>

        <p>Oh, you mean the way all western governments did back in April? Wait, no, they recommended we didn't wear one, and I seem to remember everyone agreeing.  Clearly they are all idiots, shame that the same people advising us now, they should of been fired clearly!</p>
<p>But wait, Sweden and Norway still don't recommend them - weird, their countries must be full of fucking morons!  But hang on, why aren't people dying in Sweden or Norway if they don't have lockdown or masks? Very strange. Did the evidence change? Nope.  Hmm, how weird.  Almost as if the people saying masks do nothing might be right! </p>

<p>If you have a dangerous illness, <em>you know</em>. If you need to be tested to know you had a deadly disease, it's not deadly.</p>

        <p>Aw, you seem really angry!  Once again, you are just proving you are an idiot. I'm from the UK, I voted Labour in December (very left wing by US standards), I detest Trump (and I also hate Biden as well, just to throw that out there). As for 'smooth brained', I suspect if we compared resumes, I would have a far more impressive list of accomplishments that have lead to me being pretty much financially independent, as in not needing to work, in my mid 30s.  All of your assumptions are wrong, on many different levels.  You should rethink some of your badly thought out opinions - and be less angry, it's bad for your health.</p>

        <p>99.997% survival rate. Sure. Your maths is amazing. if 2.699% ppl died how does that make the survival rate 99.997%. Im happy to teach someone maths</p>
<p>You first take the number of people who have died (as of rn   1,151,591) and then you divide it by the total cases till now (as of rn 42,659,340) and then you multiply it by 100. and u get the death percent. now u subtract this from 100. voila u get the survival rate which is 97.30049503813233</p>
