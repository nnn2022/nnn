        <p>Arrogance is one of the most contemptible human traits. Having this enormous sense of intellectual superiority over millions of people many of whom are much more intelligent than you are is both short sighted and repugnant</p>

        <p>So many WILL believe that which is the sad thing. Everyone I know could never believe a vaccine would ever cause harm. the “statistic” is still lower than covid deaths. Then I say “what if you were part of that statistic?” “Yeah right”</p>

        <p>This is a really important point. Many of them secretly know they've been fooled by now, but now they won't admit it for the life of them cos they are embarrassed they've been scammed. It's pathetic really, they'd rather be like slaves and keep destroying their kids fiture than say "yep i was wrong. "</p>

        <p>It's like they're rooting for a sports team. "Well, I chose my team, and now I'm sticking with it just to spite the fans of the other team ... muh loyalty ... muh ego ..."</p>
<p>I was rooting for whatever it takes to defeat the dreaded corona, this time last year, and I changed my mind when new information was introduced. What a concept! To people reading this, you are allowed to change your mind. I'll change my mind again if even more new information can change my mind. There's no shame in that.</p>
<p>I've seen a few posts where people say weird, <em>weird</em> stuff about even if the vaccine was deadly, they'd still get it just to trigger the "T" supporters, as if the whole world has embraced the vaccine except for half of one country. It's not about T at all, it's about thinking logically.</p>

<p>This! I couldn't word it better. I was the same ,i used to be scared shitless in feb last yr and thought it's gonna be a new bubonic plague as i knew about the virus a bit before it came on Western news so i've anticipated it from the news in Wuhan. I was stockpiling food ,giving dirty looks to ppl who dared to be less than 2m away from me i disinfected my hands like a lunatic and was a good lil brainwashed sheep at that point, as there wasn't any proof at that that this virus isn't in fact a new plague.</p>
<p>However ,by the March last yr, i've noticed that there is a shit-ton of propaganda revolving around this virus ,a shit ton of restrictions while at the same time ,there just isn't that many deaths and most ppl survive it just like any normal flu, so i started researching for myself and figured out that we are being played.</p>
<p>But what i'm truly afraid regarding doomers is that they don't care about the truth any more. At this point ,they see that being pro restriction and yell about the science and masks is a great karma whoring strategy and it seems that they are legit willing to demean themselves into slaves for a dose of virtue signaling and some meaningless likes on FB. Its depressing what a spineless bootlicker the average Joe is and it really makes me want to live outside of "society" as 2020 shown me how rotten it all really is.</p>

        <p>Me too. It all went downhill around 2012 ,when ppl started using smartphones and became addicted to their notifications. </p>
<p>Social media is a real plague my friend, which totally destroyed the humanity in humans. </p>
<p>I bet, that if the lockdowns would happen in the 90ies when there wes no social media, ppl would see that the bodies aren't piling up and would violently protest against the lockdowns ,bcs of sheer deprivation of social contact and boredom. As back then ,you had to go out and actually meet your friends to pass time. Unlike nowadays, when the social distancing doesn't sounds too bad ,since you can turn on your fucking phone and be with your virtual "friends" all day long wo even leaving your cozy bed. I'm  28 and i've cut the social media out of my life yrs ago and i feel like outcast for not using them ,while everyone around me is glued to their screens 24/7.</p>

        <p>I'm Gen X, so the 90s was my jam. I was a leftist, but that meant it was really cool to be "alternative" and not trust things. You're absolutely right, people would leave their homes unless they were an "internet geek" and would see right away that everything is fine unless they're being reminded of it constantly, but there were precedents, TV, radio, magazines, already owned and pushing agendas. Phones could be carried in the pocket, but they were just phones, not scrying mirrors. </p>
<p>My only worry is that both corona and the vaccine are just scare tactics to loosh my emotional energy, like everything else on TV.</p>
<p>As for friends, what can I say? Being alone helps you get in touch with your higher self, I guess.</p>

        <p>Mhm i was a leftist too ,until they've started begging for more GVT control and social obedience around 2015.  Nowadays i'm politically unaffiliated. Vote left or right it all ends up in the same basket. </p>

<p>Vaccine yourself to protect yourself, your love ones , friends and also patients. And to mention quickly I have info for anty-vaccines and anty-coviders if you want to contact Bill Gates you can do this through me. I can also provide for you from my organism the 5G network.
