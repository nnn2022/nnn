    <strong>Do not fight each other, fight the power! Please read pro and anti v</strong>
    <p><p>I think that three of the most fear based feelings for humans are, fear of death, fear of losing freedom and fear of not belonging. Right now it's not a war of pro v against "anti v" it's a war of fears. People who fear are easier to rule, or in fear of lack of freedom grows resistance. This might be orchestrated or not, but it really doesn’t matter for the bigger picture of thinking. The matter is to overcome the flight or fight mechanism, overcome the fear despite on what side of the fence you are.</p>
<p>First of all, for me, I am not an anti v per se, I just want to bide my time until maybe there is a real plague and also well tested v if needed, for now I rely on my t-cells.</p>
<p>Any way if we spell it out better amongst common people:</p>
<p><strong>Pro v:</strong> Surely fear of death, and some in some way fear of not belonging and also in some ways fear of not getting back to the normal and have less freedom (that side is slowly starting to wake up).</p>
<p>I can understand and relate to that fear, on do not want to die and one do not want at least friends and family do die or get hurt. That is both fear and compassion, but the fear is overruling the feelings, hence the critical thinking is gone.</p>
<p>Fear of not belong, well my friend took the shot, his friend did and I do, so I won’t be bullied for not being in the gang, instead I bully others to falsely raise my bad self-esteem.</p>
<p>Fear of not going back to normal: you stupid c*nts take the f*cking shot I don't want to live like this no more I want to head bang on the nearest concert, get drunk and f*ck a goat. Where some, hey there so the shots are not working, I need to take more and I didn't get my promised freedom. It splits in two ways, they lied to me I am waking up, or it's you f*cking tw*ts that made the delta and will make the omega, take the shoot, taaaaaake the shot!</p>
<p>For all you I just say, I understand fear and to be ruled by it, we live in a shitty world, with shitty companies and governments and msn who always use fear to put us against each other to get what they want and so on.</p>
<p>But let's say like this if following a super non tinfoil hat thinking. The vaccines are okay; they provide good protection but to many there are too many bad side effects including deaths. Since viruses mutate as they always do with or without vaccines (new seasonal flus every year remember, its nothing new) wouldn't it be good enough so that the elders and the weak took the vaccine, since if you took it from your point of view you won't get really sick? Why does it matter if someone didn't take the vaccine if your loved ones and maybe your self are protected? Riddle me this, riddle me that!</p>
<p><strong>Anti v-</strong> A big range from conspiracy theorist, to f*ck the government to I want to wait 2-3 more years or what so on that new tech vaccine. Nearly all in this group have fear to not live a free life, to think as they want in general and do as they want in general, many might feel also that this kind of society is nothing for them.</p>
<p>A pro v:er, disregards almost every aspect of these things and say one is dumb or conspiracy theorist or what so if one as us questions the narrative. And I ask you now pro v:er, what does t matter just take your shot and give it to your grandma if she wants!?</p>
<p>For me since I am in this category but I don't believe Biden (while old and not clear at all) eats babies for breakfast and so on. I am against Orvelism and Huxleism and even more against divide and conquer. I strongly don't like corrupt politicians no matter what side they represent.</p>
<p>Also since I know the basics of how viruses work and spread I never even before this, went out coffin, doing kisses or whatever if I am sick, I stay at home. Yes I do know it's a luxury for many, since a lot loses money if they stay home sick, but I did it even when I was earning less than random Mc Donald’s employee. And I will continue to do it. That is by far the best way not to spread any disease!</p>
<p>I myself really don't have any fear of any of those three things (fear fucks up the mind), since my ego and readiness is prepared for off grid and my close relatives have fought the Nazis and if needed I will for everybody’s freedom. </p>
<p>I also think there is enough evidence that is not near thin foil conspiracy theorism in debunking failed pcr test, rich corruptors getting richer on the vaccines, medicines not allowed since then they can’t FastTrack new vaccines.  Also the censorship makes me sick, any argument or science should always stand the test of trials and be freely to spoke about.  What do you pro v:ers say about this?</p>
<p>For me you are not transparent and want do censor people/statistics or whatever, well then you are mostly lying in some kind of way.</p>
<p>While it could just be stupid and desperate leaders, who try to act but do it out of fear and not professionalism and so on, well just read above. When big things happen think about who is benefitting from it and why is it almost nearly the same people!</p>
<p>I don't distrust governments per se, but I sure don't swallow all their shit, and it has been a lot of shit now.</p>
<p>So to round it up I think pro v:ers and all l else should look at Russel Brand on yt who do good research are smart (I know I have an iq of about 127-135 and can recognize his smartness) funny and dares to speak out. Check in his latest on corruption with Nancy P and covid censorship.</p>
<p>Any way we shouldn't fight each other, we should fight corruption and those who want to put us against each other, by raising our fear so they can rule over us! Covid should NOT be politics! Refuse the new normal!</p>
<p>Your thoughts on this?</p></p>
