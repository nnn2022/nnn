<p>Chickenpox, measles, mumps, etc. Hepatitis and meningitis in some places, IIRC. You might be able to get an exemption, but....well, you shouldn't need an exemption. And those under the legal age of adulthood can only hope their parents will even consider that option.</p>

<p>Except what constitutes a "danger" in our bullshit courts isn't settled science. Once upon a time, being poor or gay would be a "danger" worthy of mandatory medical treatment. Better to just get that grave dug or retort lit rather than force/coerce someone into a perhaps a lifetime of neurological harm just so maybe you can HeLp ThEm someday.</p>

<p>Aside from coincidental links, there is no <em>causal</em> link between the vaccine and death. This is an important distinction. There is currently no established "yes, the vaccine itself cause this person to die" case that I'm aware of.</p>

        <p>I mean, yes, that's typically how most viruses do their thing. They weaken the immune system to a point where opportunistic infection (like pneumonia) set in. The key thing is that if they didn't get COVID they wouldn't have died, hence why the death is caused <em>by</em> it. The virus can also cause cytokine storms which can destroy lung tissue extremely quickly in some people.</p>

<p>Except this isn't the case because the mRNA vaccine <em>only</em> generates a limited number of proteins for the immune system to target and cannot replicate itself. The immune system is easily capable of taking care of the vaccine. This is the exact same mechanism used in every single vaccine ever created.</p>

        <p>Because <em>it is</em>. Adenovirus vaccines have the same mechanism of action when it comes to provoking an immune response, except it uses a weakened virus to express the proteins rather than having our cells do that work.</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines were developed first because they can be created extremely quickly compared to traditional vaccines. With adenovirus-type vaccines you have months of cell culturing and variations to get what you want, while mRNA is "what protein do we need for the immune system to see" and coding the mRNA appropriately.</p>
<p>I get it, the new technology is scary, but it's a relatively simple process after breaking down all the technical aspects of it.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s been noted the spike protein leaves the mRNA vaccine unexpectedly</p>
<p>In mice with a 10x dose by weight, sure. No human studies have been done that show this. Besides, there's <em>also</em> no evidence that the protein causes any harm at such small concentrations even if it did.</p>

<p>The end result is the same. Proteins mimicking the virus are expressed, the immune system deals with them. They <em>both</em> use proteins (the spike protein) to accomplish it.</p>
<p><a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/covid-19-vaccines-dont-affect-ovaries-or-fertility-in-general-the-vaccines-are-highly-effective-at-preventing-illness-and-death/">This review goes over the study quite well</a> and explains further why it might not even matter.</p>
<p>&rt;Sarcastic question, when was the last safe human mRNA vaccine used?</p>
<p>I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? Clinical trials with thousands of participants were done with no notable adverse events, so it's deemed safe in regards to the normal standards of testing that exist.</p>
<p>&rt;Are these companies doing their due diligence of pharmacoketric modeling? Pfizer only reported 48 hours afterwards when typical studies look at 2 weeks</p>
<p>I don't know the answer to this, but to me it doesn't seem relevant. There's no mechanism for proteins to replicate on their own, so the numbers will simply trend down as they degrade naturally.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> know that everyone (like the CDC) is keeping a close eye on adverse events and looking at trends. When you're vaccinating tens of millions of people, there's a lot of noise and it's extremely important to understand what you're looking at.</p>

        <p>True, but people screaming from the rooftops that vaccines are killing people is woefully misguided. Unfortunately, you can't change people's opinions if they're set in one place. It's most obvious to me when I point out these things and are just downvote brigaded by the regular readers here rather than people wanting to have a conversation.</p>

        <p>Here's the struggle, though. If you wait for long term studies (how long is long enough, 3, 5, 10 years?), the virus will simply rage unimpeded throughout the population and cause many more deaths in the process.</p>
<p>Sure, it has a "98% survival rate" based on global infection versus death rate, but that's due to our lockdowns and getting a vaccine to control the spread. If left alone, we'd have <em>millions</em> more infections at the very least. Unimpeded spread also allows for mutations which could be either more lethal or just spread quickly.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's people who get sick but survive. They need medical care, right? Imagine tens of thousands of people per day getting the virus. Even if it was "just a flu", it's still an enormous strain on healthcare resources worldwide. You'd get delayed care for other illnesses, miss cancer screenings, and all sorts of things we'd like to avoid.</p>
<p>Or...you do your due diligence to be sure the injection doesn't kill people (phase 2 trials) and carefully monitor the results as vaccinations are carried out. Currently, the vaccine has somewhere around a 0.008% mortality rate if you're talking raw numbers without context (VAERS, for example). This is a lower death rate than taking an oral contraceptive which has decades of safety studies.</p>
<p>It's really about managing risk and controlling the spread. Take the game "Pandemic" for example. It's a game, so it makes some concessions from real life, but it's based on real life models of how a disease spreads. If nothing is done to control it (easy settings), even common viruses will spread like wildfire, overwhelming healthcare systems and causing death simply because it's infecting millions of people.</p>
<p>Historically, there's no evidence of vaccinations causing long-term harm. We've seen issues with certain vaccines (Gardasil for HPV, for example) that pop up a few months after vaccination, but never <em>years</em>. The mechanism of how vaccines work simply makes long term effects extremely unlikely - so unlikely that the risk of waiting far outweighs taking action earlier.</p>

        <p>lockdowns did not accomplish anything in terms of slowing or stopping the spread of the virus.  Lockdowns and other restriction did cause people to miss cancer screenings and other routine, potentially life saving medical treatments though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/26/instagram-posts/chart-comparing-new-york-and-florida-covid-19-flaw/">Well, that was proven false</a>, so that's explained. That area was hit extremely hard at the beginning of the pandemic because of its dense population, so numbers are <em>still</em> high as a result. Flordia is actually trending upwards again with thousands of cases per day, so I don't understand that argument.</p>
<p>&rt;What tells you that letting people interact with others here but not there, and these times but not other times has any basis in science at all, is that just your gut feeling?</p>
<p>I can't answer that question because I don't decide those things. Trends are important, and differing policies company to company, state to state, and country to country all dictate what response was taken.</p>
<p>&rt;Please do explain to me the scientific basis for claiming that preventing people from going to the local hardware store, but allowing them to go to Home Depot prevents the spread of a virus?</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe the local hardware store had zero prevention measures or couldn't afford them (PPE, plexiglass shielding, etc) and a large company like Home Depot does? There's a <em>lot</em> of variables at play here.</p>
<p>&rt;New Zealand is an island. </p>
<p>Most places are islands, just bigger ones. Geography does impact spread, but in the age of airplane and sea travel, not really.</p>

<p>As far as me asking what is it that leads you to conclude that something that is scientifically speaking, unsupportable, ie, that forcing some businesses to close, but not others, and restricting people being in contact with each other in some places but not others, at some times but not others, somehow is scientifically valid, I don't decide those things either - but I am capable of using common sense and a basic understanding of the rudimentary foundations of scientific principles to conclude that bullshit is bullshit.  Lockdowns as implemented are absolute bullshit.  There is no scientific logic that could lead any rational person to conclude that somehow they would have any effect at all.  You are doing mental gymnastics to thrash and fight against basic common sense and actual scientific reason.</p>

        <p><a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/american-institute-for-economic-research/">Yeah, might want to check how biased your sources are</a>. Obviously economic researchers are going to downplay lockdowns because it obviously affects the economy, but it doesn't tell the full story.</p>
<p>I'll pose this question: what do you think would happen if we didn't lock down at all? No masks, no social distancing, just a normal life? There'd certainly be less people around at the end as everyone high risk eventually caught the virus and died, that's for sure.</p>
<p>If you need any further evidence that lockdowns actually work, look at <em>any graph depicting cases and deaths</em> and you will see an obvious downtrend when lockdowns went into effect. New York is a great example. They locked down mid-April, cases plummeted. They lifted restrictions towards the holidays and cases spiked to over <em>15,000 per day</em>, causing a subsequent lockdown. Statistics are pretty obvious, here.</p>
<p>Am I saying what we did as a lockdown was the right choice? Of course not - it was a damned mess, but you cannot say that not doing anything would have had a positive outcome.</p>

        <p>The Wall Street Journal is a disreputable source now?  'Everyone high risk eventually caught the virus and died'?  You desperately want to believe what you want to believe.  You are wrong.  You have offered up not one scintilla of valid reasoning as to how 'lockdowns' could possibly have any effect of a virus spreading - because there isn't a shred of scientific validity to that proposition.  If MSNBC told you everyone had to wear dildos on their head to prevent the moon from falling out of the sky, would you comply?  Seems so.

        <p>Tell me the answer to the very simple question I have put to you at least 3 times now.  What is the scientific rationale that would lead anyone to conclude that the mechanisms employed as 'lockdowns' could possibly lead to a reduction in the spread of a virus?  Do that.  Also, I provided links to 3 different studies done by actual scientific researchers who all concluded lockdowns served no purpose and achieved nothing.  One of those sources was the Wall Street Journal, a paragon of unbiased truthful journalism acknowledged as such universally, but you didn't even bother to look at it because it doesn't support your uninformed conclusions.  There is no 'obvious trend' and that is exactly the point of those studies, but you didn't read any of them.

        <p>I'd say I agree with like 80% of that. It's 100% about managing risk. No decision in your life is completely risk-free. Hell driving to work is inherently dangerous. </p>
<p>I actually don't think people who get sick but survive need medical care. The vast majority of cases were simply sent home and told to quarantine. They did and survived. As long as we keep infection rates lower than hospital capacity, meh. It seems like this is the one epidemic where we sacrifice the lives of the young for the sake of the old. By all means quarantine the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, but at no point did I stop working during this whole thing. My demographic didn't justify it to me.</p>

        <p>So, as we look at the tail end of the pandemic (thanks to vaccinations, who knew?) there's a lot of hindsight to work with and things that can be done better for future pandemic preparedness. I agree with you - full scale lockdowns were likely <em>too much</em> based on how much economic damage it caused, but we had no idea what we were dealing with at the time.</p>
<p>One big issue that delayed response time and preventing all of this in the first place was making the response political. It looked bad to see rising numbers, so effort was made to reduce testing and sticking heads in the sand and pretending that it will just go away. By the time it was decided that a "two week lockdown" would work, it was far too late. Countries that acted swiftly had far better outcomes in the end.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there is much to be learned from the pandemic in terms of response.</p>

        <p>The problem is there is no true data on the vaccines efficacy long term, how long anti-bodies last, what variants it works against. Vaccinated or non-vaccinated, viruses mutate, that's what they do. The focus on this pandemic by world leaders has always been pushing a vaccine when a lot more money, research and time could have been spent exploring treatment options which there are many that work great when applied early. Instead these treatments get thrown aside labeled as no evidence and censored. </p>
<p>When this shit all broke down not much was know about how to treat the virus and so there were a shit load of casualties as you would expect. At this time there are doctors all over the world who have protocols for treating the virus with good survival rates, again they get little attention in the media. In the media we get people who have never even treated a covid patient with no clinical experience demanding that the vaccine is the only way. It's one of the interventions, not the only and it shouldn't be used for everyone. Especially when there is growing evidence of viral escape and people that are vaccinated still getting COVID and dying. Until there is open honest discussion about the negatives of the vaccine and acknowledgement of the brilliant work of doctors who are successfully treating COVID I won't trust the current evidence of the vaccine because there really isn't true objective data, just correlations currently. Natural immunity will always beat programmed immunity and for my health as a 30 year old very fit person I'm not going to just fall on the societal sword when anyone using their brain to raise rational questions gets dismissed as a heretic. Fuck that. I'm going to loose my job over this principle because they are mandating vaccination but at the end of the day it's worth it. I have to trust my gut and what I have researched more than societal pressure</p>

        <p>&rt;  Especially when there is growing evidence of viral escape and people that are vaccinated still getting COVID and dying.</p>
<p>99+% of people who are hospitalized currently are unvaccinated, so I'd love to see evidence to support that.</p>
<p>&rt;Instead these treatments get thrown aside labeled as no evidence and censored.</p>
<p>Correct, because even initial trials showed anecdotal promise at best, or the trials were not carried out properly, or the results were not statistically significant compared to the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;In the media we get people who have never even treated a covid patient with no clinical experience demanding that the vaccine is the only way</p>
<p>Same the other direction. Just look at this sub. Hundreds of armchair pathologists are claiming the vaccine is poison and disregarding scientific evidence that what their talking heads say is blatantly false.</p>
<p>&rt;I won't trust the current evidence of the vaccine because there really isn't true objective data, just correlations currently</p>
<p>But yet you trust random youtube doctors? Surely you see the irony.</p>
<p>&rt;Natural immunity will always beat programmed immunity and for my health as a 30 year old very fit person</p>
<p>Basic immunology says there's no such thing as "programmed immunity". Your natural immunity is the initial reaction to an unknown pathogen. In <em>most cases</em>, healthy immune systems will respond in time before the virus can replicate enough to overwhelm it. Cool. However, you have a higher chance of getting so-called "long COVID" (long-term effects, including reduced lung function, etc) when fighting it off naturally than you do having any effects at all from the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not going to just fall on the societal sword when anyone using their brain to raise rational questions gets dismissed as a heretic.</p>
<p>Ignoring scientific evidence that doesn't agree with what you perceive as right is not "using your brain". It's being willfully ignorant.</p>

        <p>But this vaccine is different because it is likely that regular boosters every six months will be pushed and perhaps made mandatory.</p>
<p>Are you sure, no long term effects will occur if you take this vaccine every 6 months or every year?</p>

        <p>Without body autonomy, there can be a consensus that certain races/ IQ levels/ income levels having children would lead to a net negative on society, and need mandatory sterilizations and abortions.</p>
<p>It might be hyperbolic, but forcing untested medical procedures on a population can lead us all down to very dark roads.</p>

        <p>It could start by requiring that all teen girls be put on birth control "for their own good" - like a temporary vaccine against teen pregnancy! Kind of like mandating the Gardasil vaccine to prevent HPV which is sexually transmitted...</p>

        <p>Can you give me an example of a vaccine that’s had  major side effects (including death) appear 5 years after administration? </p>
<p>Typically if you’re going to have a reaction to a vaccine, it’s going to be shortly after administration (within 24 hours to a couple days after).</p>
<p>Also - if you’re concerned about long term effects of being vaccinated, shouldn’t you also consider the long term effects of having Covid? People with “long Covid” or “post Covid syndrome” report a wide range of symptoms lasting months after infection.</p>
