    <strong>No vacations - How is everyone handling this?</strong>
    <p><p>Well, I should clarify, no normal vacations. Yeah, most of us can travel somewhat, but you have to wear masks everywhere, maybe get tested, have to think of quarantines/curfews/lockdowns/capacity restrictions. </p>
<p>Is anyone traveling? How hard is it to plan around all the restrictions and rules? If you're traveling, where are you going? Was it enjoyable?</p>
<p>I'm so depressed over this. We are coming upon a year of pretty much no vacations. Then I think of those folks in Europe. I live in the USA, where we barely get any paid vacation time from work. We hear that people in Europe get so much time off and travel all over. Are Europeans allowed to travel anywhere? Are they going on proper vacations? I imagine it must be even harder on them. </p>
<p>I live in Florida, so I already live in an open state, I can drive to the beach (meh), I can go do Disney (masks required). But I like to visit other places to experience sites I'm not familiar with. You know, the purpose of travel. My favorite form of traveling is cruising. Guess what. Cruises are doomed here in the US due to the CDC. Even if they start to allow cruising again, masks will be required. And maybe vaccines. So what good is that? Who wants to wear a mask on a cruise in the Caribbean? ugh.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly depends who you talk to, I’ve noticed that non European destinations seem to be more popular this year, Morocco and Dubai especially whereas no one is going to Portugal/Spain/Greece etc.</p>

        <p>You sure about Dubai? A friend of mine who was going there for work about 3 months ago was forced to sit on a quarantine in a hotel for two weeks. If it was a vacation trip, it would be pretty darn expensive, I think.</p>

        <p>So fucking stupid. Some of the places enforcing that (Hawaii, hello) are those that rely heavily, almost completely, on tourism. People aren't going to travel to you when they can't be a tourist. Im surprised they haven't went under or threw in the towel in desperation because most people can't afford two weeks of quarantine and then time to actually enjoy themselves.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you're able to get away! Yes, I'm getting mental problems as well. I've always read articles that travel and even the act of planning a vacation is good for you. I'm going nuts over this. I totally agree with "this isn't living, it's existing".</p>

        <p>You are very lucky to live in Florida where the number of maskholes is relatively small compared to the rest of the ussa. But yeah, exactly a year ago in early Feb (right before this nonsense went down and ruined society) I was planning a May trip through Europe - Paris, London, etc. Now I don't see that  happening anytime soon. I also don't want to have to prove I don't have this stupid virus that I may don't even know I have to travel and risk being locked in an "isolation facility" (ie covid prison) for 2 weeks, so flying anywhere is basically out now and I know it's only a matter of time before they start rolling out Gates stupid vaccine passports and destroy the last vestiges of free travel. Also I have always wanted to go on a cruise, but that's also out as well. Yeah, any kind of fun tourism  to the major destinations without masks or restrictions is pretty much gone. It sucks.</p>

        <p>Was checking out a customer the other day and a friend of hers came up to her.</p>
<p>“I just went to Mexico on vacation,” she said.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? How was it?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t leave my room. Once I got there we found out everything was closed.”</p>
<p>“Oh I didn’t think Mexico was doing anything,” the customer replied. “That’s good,” she added on, telling her friend that she was glad her vacation was ruined.</p>
<p>“Then when I wanted to come home they wouldn’t let me travel without my dog in a cage. But all the pet stores were shut down so the woman I rented a room from had to go out and found us a bird cage to put it in. I almost couldn’t come home.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad Mexico is doing something about all this.”</p>
<p>They don’t even hear themselves speak. It took so much for me to not scream.</p>

        <p>I travelled a lot last year, but mostly outdoor in National Parks in California, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming and Nevada. There are some challenges with the mask mandates, but inside the park most people hanging around without masks. Eating out could be a challenge, because even in open states they still have limits how many people could get in. All those places are more crowded than usual,  no one is going abroad and all other local entertainments are closed.</p>

        <p>Good point about those types of destinations becoming more crowded. It will probably get even busier as more people are getting cabin fever and need to get away. </p>
<p>I wonder how Biden's federal mask mandate has affected the national parks. I can't even imagine going on a hike in a mask. Let's hope the 100 days is really 100 days (like how two weeks to flatten the curve turned into almost 52 weeks...)</p>

        <p>We aren't big travel folks but we did cancel our yearly trip last year as we weren't about to mask up and do all that bullshit. We prefer nature travels though so we stayed in-state and did national and state forests to camp which was great.</p>
<p>They had signs about masks in shared bathrooms etc but no one was doing it. We were able to book sites that accommodated the number of people when meeting up with family and they didn't know or care we weren't a shared household. Both families came from other states and they were allowed in. We're in a midwest state with less strict insanity, some states we looked at wouldn't allow anyone out of state to enter the national/state parks or forests.</p>

        <p>UK: I literally can't go to France right now, which just makes me feel empty to think about, honestly. French is my second language, I'd worked so hard to learn it the year before all this nonsense, and I'd set my heart on it last May. It wasn't really a holiday but something that meant a lot more than that.</p>
<p>My dad's trip to Poland was cancelled last year and rebooked to this May too, but I still can't see him winding up going right now.</p>
<p>My sister did go to Sweden in November, which sounded pretty cool - a member of airport staff told her she didn't need the mask during the checks when she got off the plane, and people were just, being actually normal.</p>

        <p>I had a trip to Australia and Hawaii planned for last year and Japan for this year. Hawaii may be an option much later this year. Japan looks more like next year now and Australia probably in 2057 the rate they are going.</p>

        <p>Can't afford to travel anyway, unless you count one of the state parks only a 15 minute drive away.  Both were closed from March to maybe June or September last year, now both are open for the time being, but I'm expecting them to close again within the next few months. Husband and I are NOT looking forward to it.</p>

        <p>My bf’s parents have gone to Turkey from the UK in Oct. and his sister went to Dubai. We haven’t been able to see them, however, since we’re in San Diego. He might have to meet them somewhere like that to be able to visit, but I don’t think I could wear a mask for 20+ hours while traveling. I just went to visit my family in MI for Xmas and that was long enough to have to put up with the BS of traveling! Right now I’m trying to plan a weekend away to Arizona or Utah, somewhere more open. Was thinking of going to the national parks, but not sure now if they’re going to be crowded.</p>
