        <p>I have a friend who's a high school teacher, and she said in her district (not her school) there were two suicides, and three more attempted. Teenagers have such strong impulses and such a poor sense of the future; they need to be encouraged and taught to be healthy, not steeped in fear and hopelessness.</p>

        <p>I think stuff like this is what the powers that be want. We already know that public schooling is not actual education, merely an indoctrination camp that keeps you conditioned from asking the wrong questions. I believe they want those who are free thinkers to hate themselves</p>

        <p>So sad...as a mother of an almost 12 year old it breaks my heart,young people who had so much ahead of them...I cannot even imagine the pain their parents must have.</p>
<p>The number of people who died from suicide is way higher than those who died from Covid/Flu. What makes this more tragic is that it was avoidable. Those who take these decisions do not care at all.</p>
<p>In hospitals they don't treat people who need organ transplants and cancers anymore. Let's remember that Covid has a rate of 2% death and over 95% of those who died all had comorbidity so it's pretty safe to say that the vast majority survive .If we are in this situation (denying life saving surgeries and treatments) it is certainly not because of an extra 50 hospitalizations in the biggest province of a first world country. It doesn't make sense especially that they refuse to let anyone get in there and only show images that are a year old in the news (that's without saying that they stop nurses and doctors from speaking up).</p>
<p>They do every single thing to make matters worst. Nothing at all to help,we cannot go anywhere as everything is closed and we can't go outside because of the curfew but we can get as drunk and high as we want while listening to medias scaring them 24/7. No wonder people are taking their lives. </p>
<p>Something more sinister is going on.</p>

        <p>For young people, the increase in suicides, overdoses, etc. will kill a lot more people than the virus will. They need to consider this in evaluating at what point do the costs of lockdowns/restrictions outweigh the benefits</p>

        <p>You're assuming that isn't what the government wants. Over here in the UK, through the PIP tribunals, they made targeted attacks on lifelines for the disabled and ill leading to many suicides. They're promoting euthanasia. It's only been thirty years since they gave up eugenics.</p>

        <p>This is pretty much the sole reason I haven't offed myself. If we give in, it's only going to give these sick fucks MORE fuel to spin it around and paint the picture that it's COVIDS fault. Regardless of what the future holds, we can all agree that they are never EVER going to take responsibility or admit fault, your life is currently being defined by them but for God's sake don't let them define your death.</p>
