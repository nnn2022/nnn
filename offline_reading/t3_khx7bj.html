    <strong>How uncomfortable is it normal to feel about New Normal School?</strong>
    <p><p>As a parent Ive never liked this for my kids. Since its not going away and the school openly celebrates the "forcing of their hand to finally get with the times (integrate into apps)!" ...I realize my hesitance and frankly anger towards it isnt going to benefit anyone. There are multiple apps ive been essentially forced to install and give full privacy private to. Im always very reluctant to do that, Im not a social media person, no pictures of my kids online, etc. Now they want video feeds of him and myself all the time, and just casually expect me to do it. They didnt even send out a letter about what these apps are,  NOTHING. Im tech savvy, o I know how to use them, but I dont WANT them in my home.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now theres a QR code attached to my kid that they want me to scan to log in to things and to submit the waiver promising hes been appropriately isolated. Its straining my family and my mental health-  and Im the only one who thinks twice about any of it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What I want to know is has this been extremely hard for anyone else, and is my letting it bother me rational or paranoid...?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edited to add that the biggest "issue' with my feelings towards it is that Im very non participatory. I havent installed all the apps, I dont do a lot of the communications... it makes me too uncomfortable so I avoid it and then worry Ill get CPS telling me Im not doing my job. Its gotten bad.</p></p>

<p>Worrying but not unexpected. Looks like they're conditioning the kids for constant surveillance. Are there any normal private schools in your area? Is moving to a different county/state an option for you?</p>

        <p>Is there any reason to not just start scanning it? It makes me super uncomfortable that it wasnt explained in any way and no permissions were granted... I fee like I dont know what Im doing. Everyone seems to just be like oh yea makes sense!</p>

        <p>In your shoes, I'd take a close look at the privacy options of these apps (camera, mic, location) and block their access when not in use. If your kid has a laptop, cover the camera and the mic (these apps, once installed, can act like malware). When are you supposed to scan the QR code? On that front, I'd be more worried about the psychological effects. I wouldn't want my kid to see that as a normal part of life.</p>

        <p>i've thought about this too recently and just said, "nah, won't do it, don't want to live through their app" and then think about the ramifications for the kid. i'm also a very private person and i don't post personal info or pictures online, and i wouldn't want stuff with my kid online and available to people. we are tech phobic or luddites - these are legit concerns. </p>
<p>your child is not a QR code. your child isn't a product. you shouldn't have to download an app to be an engaged parent. i don't want those apps or tech in my home or my phone and i don't want them around the kids. </p>
<p>how do you opt out of invasive tech without opting out of the kids life? super fucked up. </p>
<p>if you don't use the app, your kid loses. if you use the app, you cede control. and you're ceding control for your child, who should have a say. i also think kids should be able to control what their parents post online and vice versa. it's wild how much privacy we've given up in the last 15 years. </p>
<p>i'm with you - super non tech participatory. i don't even have the Facebook. what if that's the only way schools or teachers or PTSs reach out?i don't even like traditional PTAs but that's better than this surreal online life BS. i don't want to live or dream in digital. </p>
<p>you aren't alone. it sucks.</p>

        <p>I was very shocked at the lack of explanation. Not because I need it, but because thats sort of WHAT YOU DO with kids. Instead of signing a permission slip with the school, im signing it whoever controls these apps. They act under the auspice that with such short time to prepare this they just had t do their best...ok but then summer vacation passed and no better communication this year. It feels like they are being told what to implement and not being given any told on how to do so making their incompetence on the subject of tech very front and center. </p>
<p>There have been so many things that Im thinking, shouldnt I have to sign up? Shouldnt there be laws protecting/surrounding how this is done? SHOUDLNT THEY HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT THE QR CODE MEANS?</p>
<p>Do they even KNOW what it means?</p>

        <p>if i were a parent, and someone offered me zero explanation as to why my child needed an app to attend school, i'd balk and be absolutely livid. they are <em>children</em> - adults have a responsibility and obligation to be very straightforward and clear and explain what they are doing, why they're doing it, and how anything to do with the kids are being implemented. it feels like an abuse of power. </p>
<p>they've had nine+ months now to figure this out, and <em>this</em> is the best they can do, really? it's insulting! </p>
<p>i suppose my first question is, why can't they communicate via good old fashioned email? everyone (in theory) has email.</p>
<p>my second question is, how did they manage to keep track of the kids before QR codes? were the children just going rogue all the time before March 2020? idk about you, but i'm a child of the 1980s/90s, and we didn't have mobile phones or QR codes or anything like that, and our parents and teachers did just fine.</p>
<p>is spreadsheet management really so burdensome? it's not rocket science, ffs.</p>
<p>how are they protecting the personal protected information, data, and security of the child? their families? HIPPA stuff? there are laws and rules for the privacy rights and tech, but they aren't on your side. they should be on our side, but they're not. we have to feed to beast, right? the beast demands more data, more info, more acquiescence. </p>
<p>you - the mama - have rights. your child - the cub - has rights. it's your duty as the mama bear to protect your cub at all costs. start asking all the hard questions. you're your child's best and fiercest advocate - you're the only one with their best interest at heart.</p>
<p>if your kid's school hasn't asked these questions, maybe you should: https://www.sps-k12.com/blog/19-questions-schools-should-ask-before-implementing-new-technology</p>
<p>and finally, why aren't more parents asking questions? why aren't they worried? are they lazy? complacent? overwhelmed? are they really okay with this? is this how they imagined their kids' education?</p>
<p>you're a good parent, you're doing all the right things. you're the kind of parent i'd like to be someday. my husband and i are already talking about the "new normal" and how to opt our kids out. we want to raise them like little humans, not machines. </p>
<p>if private schools in your area don't work out for you, i think you should look into a private pod. i know you're a working mom and can't homeschool yourself, and trust me, you're not alone. plus, most parents recognize the limitations of their own knowledge and teaching ability, and they would much rather pay for someone to teach their kids than try and hack it themselves. (for example, if my parents had tried to "homeschool" me and my brother, we would have been great at military strategy and diplomatic history, but would have abjectly failed math.)</p>
<p>it might be good for you to try and seek out like-minded parents and see if they're interested in a homeschooling pod - that would cut down on the costs of a private teacher, but it would also be the best for the kids' socialization. in my area (DC metro), a lot of parents are doing the pods this year since they couldn't get into private schools on such short notice.  a few families in my office banded together and formed little primary school pods. </p>
<p>plus, you might find out that a significant number of parents have the same concerns and questions that you do, or that want a normal school environment for their kids, and they're just afraid to speak up or speak out or assert themselves. there's strength in numbers! even if you're not the majority, a small band of parents has a better chance of success than one parent.</p>
<p>you're doing all the right things, please don't be discouraged. your kid will thank you in the future, i promise.</p>

        <p>My oldest daughter is 15, she's been through the public school system and it has been eye opening.  She will be looking at apprenticeship opportunities and will graduate with trade hours.</p>
<p>My youngest daughter is 3 and will never see the public school system.  We are either homeschooling or going through private school. My wife and I have another on the way in about 5 months, as well.</p>
<p>We are not rich and paying for private school for two kids will not be easy but we do get tax breaks for it at least, unlike homeschooling.  In the end, it will be well worth the sacrifice.</p>

        <p>Just remember that homeschooling isn't necessarily a Monday to Friday 9-3 thing.  It can be worked around your schedule and assignments can be scheduled for while you are at work.</p>
<p>Since you don't have to worry about 28 other kids, as well as that slow one that never understands anything without 30 mind of extra explanation, you can focus in the subjects your child struggles in and move quicker across those they find easy.</p>

        <p>One kiddo is the slower kid. I’m just not qualified. I’m great at some
Parts of teaching but I don’t have the experience with developmental delays or teaching I general to do it justice. I’m going to really start looking at doing it regardless.</p>

        <p>In that case there might be local homeschooling groups too that can help out.  I don't live in a particularly large city and there are a couple where I live.  Check that out.</p>

        <p>I was homeschooled along with my siblings, my mom was the first to do it out of our entire extended family. The feeling you’re describing of feeling out of your depth is common if not felt by all homeschool parents entirely. You can do it!</p>

        <p>Do you have any fellow parent friends who could take turns homeschooling all of the kids? If they all work typical 9-5 m-f than you could pool money for a private tutor type of teaching.</p>

        <p>You are the reasonable one in a world of madness. </p>
<p>I'm so sorry your family is going thru this but it's scary to think they are moving this quickly into conditioning the children to be tracked, monitored and essentially treated like livestock. It's immoral and I will not stand for it, nor should you.</p>
<p>I don't have answers for what you should do next. But stick to your guns and trust your instincts. Your child is lucky to have such an aware and thoughtful parent.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I know people here I understand that sometimes you just need to hear someone give your concerns some merit. In real life people make fun of my objections or just say yea it’s weird oh well</p>

        <p>The other things to be concerned about with these apps are that most are made by an outside party so that means a 3rd party is getting between the student &amp; the teacher. These apps have been hacked before &amp; there are always privacy concerns as well as false accusations of cheating going on. How long till the day the parent &amp; teacher have zero say over what their child is learning due to some Silicon Valley software developer deciding the content the school/teacher/child/parent is covering 'violates terms &amp; conditions' (the big catch-all for any tech product)? Dystopia!</p>
