    <strong>Weird data in the original Johnson and Johnson Jab paper - was the FDA study a fair test?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't worry much about jabs - I decided I'm not getting one.</p>
<p>But it doesn't hurt to go back and revisit some of the early studies that different pharma companies submitted to the FDA / EMA.</p>
<p>Janssen and Janssen / Johnson &amp; Johnson was the most recent re-read.</p>
<p>FDA summary Sheet:</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download</p>
<p>To summarise the numbers:</p>
<p>43,783 participants, 21,895 vaccinated, 21,888 placebo</p>
<p>5 deaths in the placebo group, 0 deaths in the vaccinated group.</p>
<p>Statistically - the data can be presented two different ways. Guess which way the advertisers choose... ;)</p>
<p>1 - The vaccine prevents 100% of Covid Deaths (0 vs 5)</p>
<p>or 2 - The vaccine prevents 0.022% of Covid Deaths (5 vs 21888)</p>
<p>So the numbers show a small benefit... Apparently...</p>
<p>Because it got me thinking - what about the people dying of other causes? If you take 40,000 people, and follow them for a month, some of them will die. Because thats life.</p>
<p>Back of a napkin math calculation:</p>
<p>In 2020, the USA had a death rate of approximately 8.2 citizens per year per 1000 individuals. Therefore, in a group of 43,783 people we might expect 360 deaths. 2 equal groups, therefore we might expect 180 deaths in each group.</p>
<p>I think the Johnson and Johnson study only reported on the subject's status at 28 days after injection. So 1 month. </p>
<p>If we are anticipating 180 deaths in a year - might we anticipate 1/12 of that number of deaths in a month? Maybe 15 deaths in each group? </p>
<p>Its an estimate. Perhaps deaths are seasonal? Perhaps people behave less riskily when they are participating in a medical study? Perhaps 15 deaths in each group is not realistic, but we should expect a few, surely?</p>
<p>And very importantly, <strong>we'd expect a similar number in both groups</strong>, jabbed and non jabbed.</p>
<p>So I wanted to see the data / see the statistics for deaths from "non-covid" causes</p>
<p>There is now an "Official Science Journal" write-up for the New England Journal of Medicine:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882225/</p>
<p>To quote:
&rt; three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related).</p>
<p>So - that made me curious!</p>
<p>Because if the group demographics were equally weighted, (i.e the same number of 85 year olds in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups) you'd expect similar background mortality in both groups.</p>
<p>But we don't.</p>
<p><strong>We see a background death rate of almost 4 times higher in the non-vaccinated control group compared with the vaccinated group</strong> (11 vs 3)</p>
<p>This is pretty much the same number as we see in the "Covid deaths" (5 vs 0, as opposed to 11 vs 3)</p>
<p>This is a statistical abnormality.</p>
<p>Were the control group more sickly / vulnerable? </p>
<p>A fair test would require the two different groups to be as similar as possible, the only thing being different is the jab or no jab - then we can tell what effect the jab has. If your control group contains more vulnerable people, with other serious medical conditions, the trial data suddenly becomes a lot more questionable.</p>
<p>A supplementary appendix contains more data:</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544/suppl_file/nejmoa2101544_appendix.pdf</p>
<p>page 35 age distributions, page 43 comorbidities. </p>
<p>I only post this because I found it interesting... and it gets you thinking... how 1 elderly person dying in a trial conducted in a foreign country leads to american magazines and newspapers advertising 100% effective vaccines...</p>
<p>in a market worth billions and an apparent political project to reshape global society...</p></p>
