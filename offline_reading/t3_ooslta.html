    <strong>Discussion: I am starting to rethink this whole conspiracy aspect of Covid 19. At least what I have perceived to be the conspiracy angle of it.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start by saying I am 100% against getting the vaccine.  I never even get flu shots.  Not a single fact of science compels me to even consider getting the jab. That being said I started thinking today that if this truly was a conspiracy, the amount of people that would need to be or are involved would be astronomical. tens if not hundreds of thousands of people.  From politicians to healthcare workers.  Pharmaceutical employees to the media.  If they were to know that the vaccine is hazardous they would obviously not take it themselves.  With that being said can anyone comprehend the level of secrecy required to keep this from getting out?  It would be impossible for this not to get out with the number of people that would need to be in the loop for what we have experienced over the last year or so.  So basically I am perplexed at this point as to what is really going on.  At first and still, I believe that "They" worked with China to create the virus to disrupt the 2020 elections. With Trump sanctioning and putting tariffs on China they obviously had reason for him to lose.  I heard rumors that "They" were working on a vaccine even before the first case of the virus was publicized.  So now I am trying to figure out if the conspiracy is the virus or the coverup  or the scramble to fix a plot gone wrong.  If "They" know the vaccines are harmful and knowing that logical people are against taking it, why do they keep pushing the vaccines knowing that "Their" voter base are the only ones taking the vaccine thus putting "Their" own people at risk?  The more I think about it the more confused I get. Obviously "They" are lying about the number of deaths. And "They" are certainly lying about the negative effects of the vaccine.  What is the real end game here?  To get everyone "vaccinated"  to prove that they can control a world population? Or is the vaccine itself designed to somehow control the worlds population?  We will never know the true death count from this virus.  "They" have stopped counting normal flu deaths.  And the symptoms found in covid deaths can't be taken seriously since they rarely do autopsy's on normal flu deaths.  Who is to say you won't find the same results.  Anyway, I am more confused now then when I started typing this.  BTW I use the term "They" because I don't know who they are.  Globalists?  Politicians working with China?  Alphabet agencies?  I just believe their would need to be too many people in the loop to pull this off without someone spilling the beans so to say.</p></p>

        <p>The most common objection to a conspiracy theory:</p>
<p>“There would have to be too many people involved. Surely someone would spill the beans.”</p>
<p>Ever heard of blackmail and extortion?</p>
<p>Ever heard of compartmentalization?</p>
<p>There are people involved in the conspiracy who aren’t even aware they are involved. That’s how they get away with it.</p>

        <p>Healthcare workers do not need to be in on the conspiracy to remain quiet about the harm done by the vaccine. There's been so much propaganda in regards to them that some truly believe them to be safe and effective. Those who question these claims are afraid to speak up as they've seen what happens to the ones that do. And you have a few who do speak out against them or do not want them themselves and they are quickly being fired. Someone posted a link from the CDC the other day that showed about half of nursing home employees are not vaccinated. They would have seen early on what the vaccines do to residents and been offered vaccinations early on as well and apparently they weren't convinced of their safety if that tells you anything. </p>
<p>As to the goal of this all....who the fuck knows. I hope it's just regular old greed but only time will tell.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's a conspiracy in the sense that there is some secret shadowy group of super powerful and wealthy coordinating all this.</p>
<p>I believe it's a bunch of corrupt opportunists aided by corrupt media making money selling the biggest story since the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Whether or not the virus was intentionally created and released or just came about via bats doesn't matter.  What I saw were millions on the streets of Hong Kong protesting against authoritarian control by mainland China, and some of that sentiment seeping into the mainland.  Boom.  Videos on the web of people collapsing dead in the street and being welded into their apartments.  Huge protests in HK disappear overnight.</p>
<p>Election year in the USA.  Economy booming, MAGA rallies everywhere, shitty Dem candidates, and Trump looks unstoppable.  High profile Dems first use the racist/xenophobe angle when Trump stops flights from China, but then the lightbulb goes off.  Stop the MAGA rallies with the virus.  First Inslee in WA goes into lockdown, then Newsom in CA--without a single death there!  NY follows, and the dominoes fall.  Second lightbulb--mail in voting.  For that they had to stroke it all the way to Nov, so the mask mandates go into effect even though the seasonal virus was waning last Summer.</p>
<p>Along the way, the CDC and CMS monkey with PCR test cycles and reimbursement / coding to ensure over-diagnosis.  Hospitals are complicit because they are making money.</p>
<p>Then comes the CARES Act with huge opportunities for corruption and grift.  </p>
<p>Rinse and repeat globally, and here we are.  Politicians never let a crisis go to waste, the media peddles fear for money, and plenty of folks are so invested in this that they can't let go.</p>
<p>The vaccines were first seen as the way out while saving face, but now politicians like Macron and Johnson are seeing new possibilities.  </p>
<p>TL/DR:  No global conspiracy.  Just human nature.  Greed.  Power.  Control.</p>

        <p>Nope. There is a global conspiracy,  this thing has been in the planning for decades and they've dropped so many hints and predictive programming along the way it's hard not to see it.</p>

        <p>They create the illusion that all doctors and scientists are in agreement by deplatforming and taking away the license of any who question or go against the narrative. A doctor either turns a blind eye or risks losing everything including their ability to pay off their astronomical education debt. Top to bottom the system is all rigged against us.</p>

        <p>I want to sarcastically respond "Ok then , I guess everything is fine.. "</p>
<p>But if you know about Agenda 2030, "Build Back Better" and what those phrases mean, along with "The Great Reset" or "The 4th Industrial Revolution" and go read up on the United Nations and World Economic Forum and World Health Organization websites about what it is all about..</p>
<p>and that they are gleefully announcing "The pandemic has given us a unique opportunity to reshape and restructure our world" and are making moves worldwide, with many nations leaders onboard with 'global change' then it makes more sense.</p>
<p>Individual people don't need to be onboard in Canada, for example. Globalist PM Justin Trudeau can just go ahead and make moves on behalf of Canadians who voted him in. They knew he was a Globalist, a "Build Back Better" advocate.. They knew his stance on how "Canada has no core identity and will be the first post-national state".. </p>
<p>Canadians don't care.. they go along to get along, especially if they're getting $2000 or more in their bank accounts each month to 'play along'.</p>
<p>Take a look around.. Borders don't matter to globalists.. Mass immigration would be normal, as we reshuffle the population of the world around to reach more 'equity' between nations.</p>
<p>"It's just a conspiracy" might feel better and help you sleep at night, but it is not the truth.</p>
<p>Covid19 is the catalyst for World Change. Next on stage, "Climate Change" as the next catalyst.</p>
<p>We cannot "Build Back Better" into a New World Normal, until all the old notions, traditions, morals and expectations are destroyed.</p>
<p>"You will own nothing, and you will be happy"</p>

        <p>They want you confused as it’s easy to control a population that is. They want you questioning everything as they just change there message at the drop of a hat. Only a few know the truth and it stays that way. The news is owned by about 3 different people, so it’s not hard to manipulate the masses. Keep on your path of questioning the narrative.</p>
