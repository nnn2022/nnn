        <p>It sounds to me, that if you feel the desire to use a catchy and combative phrase you probably didn't watch it. There is something very wrong with that. Where did you hear denial?</p>
<p>The link isn't working for me, so I didn't get a chance to hear what it asserts. But I can confirm if you look into the AIDS virus, it has some of the same, if not worse, in terms of alarming patterns related to CVD19 - such as Faucci, it almost 100% likely it was engineered as you'll see from the viral genetic code, social engineering via news, medical bodies, and govs, and the use to target populations.</p>
<p>If the doc covered any similar to that, I'd say it's worth watching.</p>
<p>I hope we as a sub choose to be mindful about branding things wrong think. You invariably end up silencing the truth. Not to mention, what would we be fighting for then?</p>

        <p>I've seen it before. It's the one associated with Christine Maggiore. Who denied that she had HIV so hard that she refused to take medication while pregnant nor give her then infected daughter medication. The daughter died of AIDS at the age of three. Then she herself died of AIDS. The woman has killed god only knows how many children.</p>

        <p>I'll correct my assumption. I apologize for that. I don't know who that is or what she did. Why has she killed many children? I'll look into her story.</p>
<p>Possibly this doc isn't the best. I still can't really say, because I haven't seen it. But, yeah, the AIDS virus does have some strong parallels. Look into <a href="https://streckermemorandum.com">this</a>. It's quite the expose.</p>

        <p>She was an "activist" while alive that attempted to convince pregnant mothers with HIV not to take anti retrovirals while pregnant, breastfeed the babies, and refuse to give those same babies anti retroviral medication when they became infected. Vertical transmission of HIV is entirely preventable, and even in the 1% or less chance that prevention fails, those babies didn't have to die with the medication we have today that she scared mothers into not giving them.</p>

        <p>Hm. I'll definitely look into that story. I'll probably check in see if this link works elsewhere.</p>
