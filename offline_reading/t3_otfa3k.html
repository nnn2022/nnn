    <strong>Censorship is the NEW NORMAL</strong>
    <p><p>Mods, I apologize for this and if you deem it breaking rule 8 I understand but this is becoming the NEW NORMAL.</p>
<p>Rather than the obligatory "I got banned" post (which I just got my second 1 today) can we use our collective big brain energy to stop this rampant censorship? This sub isn't  the only one this occurs to, not by a long shot but it appears to becoming much more rampant across the platform.</p>
<p>My TLDR story: Got banned from 2 subs because of joining here. Both bans were given by bots which was listed by both ban messages. Neither sub have I ever posted or commented in therefore I had never broken any rules let alone <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Content Guidelines</a>. So, I finally decided to respond.  <a href="https://imgur.com/fJpZ88R">POST MESSAGE IMAGE</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines">Moderator Guideline</a> #8 states that " Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment. ".  And for my blatant belligerence I was muted for 7 days without an answer.</p>
<p>Bots have clearly been programmed to ban people without impunity or regard to actual content posted by a user. This is targeted harassment. Searching for recourse appears to be an absolutely fruitless endeavor and as individual appeals seem unlikely to ever be overturned.</p>
<p>What can we do for the Reddit community as a whole to stop this corrupt malicious behavior?</p></p>

        <p>When I joined reddit, the owners were proud of their freedom of speech policies - but it's been sold and taken over by a group of people who do not value freedom of speech - they have become increasingly suppressive over the years, and are squeezing the life out of reddit - a lot of users have already left and a lot more will probably leave as it gets worse - it's all we can do, we can't save it because the owners don't want certain views expressed here</p>

        <p>I thought that might be the case for some things. Opposing views on subs and breaking rules makes sense (even though I don't agree with it). But to be outright banned from a sub that has no politicized posts and without even interacting on the sub? I'm pretty sure I auto-added r/oddlysatisfying when I made my account based on interests.</p>

        <p>Breaking rules or blatant harassment sure, but I don’t agree with opposing views. We all have the right to have our own view and by sometimes exploring the opposing side is actually a benefit to open conversations up for debate and have a common progress</p>
<p>I follow journalists and news sites I disagree with, I think it’s good to question things and helps to see the gaslighting no matter which side of the fence, some journalists I used to like I realized were shams because I watch many different views</p>
<p>Or maybe I watch too much Jimmy lol</p>

        <p>As a pro-free speech mod (different sub) I can attest that I have been banned from several groups now, simply for what I have to assume is wrong-think. I do not harrass or abuse people and I have had my mind changed on topics by people who are willing to engage me in good faith arguments.</p>
<p>In the group I moderate I work with other mods to ensure that people get a chance to contest any bans and have had people re-instated. I, myself, have not banned a single person.</p>
<p>This all said, I am in the minority on Reddit it would seem (maybe this group is one of the few exceptions). Most mods I have encountered in other groups are intellectually challenged automatons who likely get a shot of adrenalin every time they purge a wrong-thinker from their insular "community". I haven't yet encountered one such mod who was willing to have a good faith discussion about any of my bans, and not even one who would even reply to any of my queries regarding my bans.</p>
<p>It would seem that western civilization is churning out these anti-intellectual NPCs by the truck load and I would say that they likely dominate Reddit at this point, as they do with most other forms of social media.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to sort this out, since as they say, you can't fix stupid, and stupid appears to be everywhere.</p>
