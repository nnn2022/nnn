    <strong>Resources to Help in Legally Combatting the Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>You may think that if you pull no influence and have little money then there’s nothing you can do to legally combat your employer, school, etc. Lots of attorneys are ready and willing to defend you against vaccine mandates but are made inaccessible due to the price of hiring them. The aim of this post is to show that there are things you <strong>can</strong> do as an American citizen with rights.</p>
<p>I’m by no means a law or medical expert. Everything I’m saying here is based on my understanding of basic human rights along with what I’m understanding from the resources that I am about to share with you. Please let me know if something does not seem correct.</p>
<p>Also, I cannot vouch for or guarantee the success of any of these strategies… I just want to help.</p>
<p>What the government and these large companies are doing is outright criminal and illegal when a non FDA approved drug is involved. It’s already a rights violation to even ask whether you are vaccinated, let alone mandate it. The gall of these companies is incredible as they have shockingly little legal standing and are opening themselves up to a slew of backlash and lawsuits. The only reason they think they can get away with it is because they’re large and they think that they’re too large and important be given up. It’s up to us show them how wrong they are.</p>
<p>Here are some possible strategies to employ:</p>
<p>· First, know your rights.</p>
<p>Read the Nuremberg Code, especially point number 1. As a non FDA approved drug, the vaccine falls under the category of experimental.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Code</a></p>
<p>Here is an article laying out what is and is not allowed with a vaccine issued as EUA.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/federal-law-prohibits-employers-and-others-from-requiring-vaccination-with-a-covid-19-vaccine-distributed-under-an-eua/">https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/federal-law-prohibits-employers-and-others-from-requiring-vaccination-with-a-covid-19-vaccine-distributed-under-an-eua/</a></p>
<p>Here are some public documents that have been written in opposition to vaccine mandates as well as general COVID policies:</p>

<p>Here is a Telegram group dedicated to supporting people at risk of losing their jobs over the vaccine. I’m told that there is a pinned message here where case briefings and other documents are shared to help others facing termination:</p>
<p><a href="https://t.me/joinchat/7tcmWxK0u_YyNjRh">https://t.me/joinchat/7tcmWxK0u_YyNjRh</a></p>
<p>· If your employer or school says anything about mandating a vaccine, I would feel alright about firing off a warning shot right away with something like this: <strong>“Are you ready to accept all liability for all potential vaccine injury done to me?”</strong> (In the unlikely scenario that they happen to say yes, and you agree to those terms, have them sign a full liability waiver in writing. I’m told that templates can be found of these waivers online, perhaps at the Telegram chat that I linked above, although I do not have a link on hand. Also, if you go this route, keep a journal for the weeks leading up to and after you get vaccinated. Monitor your symptoms and feelings and write them down so that it will be easy to link your symptoms to the vaccine).</p>
<p>I don’t really expect any employer to back down over this, but maybe. Like I said companies are insane for mandating these vaccines and any legal team would be wise to back down at this point. It will at least show them that you mean business about defending your rights and give them a fair warning.</p>
<p>· If your employer doesn’t respond to that then this link might be of use to you:</p>
<p><a href="https://store.thewellnessway.com/freedom-documents">https://store.thewellnessway.com/freedom-documents</a></p>
<p>I watched the video that is linked on the store page and it is good. My understanding is that for the price of $20 these are legal document templates that you personalize with your own information and send to your employer. They are written by an attorney in Wisconsin and are designed to get you a head start.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is that your employer will have to respond to these documents. If their response is not acceptable to you (or they ignore you after several attempts), you can take their response to an attorney in your area and <strong>they will likely see it as a promising case and will begin to defend you for little up front money on the basis that they will probably win. If they win your employer will have to pay the remaining attorney fees.</strong> By the way, according to the video in this link, the lawsuits are already coming out, people. <strong>They’re winning</strong>. Of course, that sort of thing is not shown on the media.</p>
<p>· Here is another anonymous letter template that may or may not elicit a more cooperative response from your employer:</p>
<p><a href="https://vivabarneslaw.locals.com/post/889925/vaccine-mandate-protest-letter?fbclid=IwAR1cyRNNE_S3bGD9xKwEK8FpkMdL9uZpcoAnOW6QUTevvHj2LnX8ORqVw_A">https://vivabarneslaw.locals.com/post/889925/vaccine-mandate-protest-letter?fbclid=IwAR1cyRNNE_S3bGD9xKwEK8FpkMdL9uZpcoAnOW6QUTevvHj2LnX8ORqVw_A</a></p>
<p>· Of course, If you have the funds to pay for an attorney outright and it looks like you’ll be needing one, I would encourage you to not mess around with sending your own legal documents and just skip to hiring someone.</p>
<p>· If none of these have worked, you are required by law to be able to have a religious exemption. A signature from some sort of religious authority will be required. It can be <strong>any</strong> religious authority. It does not have to be <strong>your</strong> authority. As a religious person myself, I will not condone you to lie to anyone about your beliefs, but I will say that I’m not sure if getting vaccinated myself would line up with 1 Corinthians 19-20 in the Bible.</p>
<p>· If it comes to it, don’t quit. Let them fire you, and keep the termination letter. That way you have more of a legal standing if you decide to file a suit, or you decide to help another suit.</p>
<p>· Lastly, boycott any company requiring the vaccine for entry or for its employees. I used to be a huge fan of Google and Netflix; no longer. </p>
<p>These are the companies that are requiring vaccines for its for employees: governments, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Walmart, Disney, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Saks Fifth Avenue, The Washington Post, Union S0quare Hospitality Group, Ascension Health, Lyft, Uber, Twitter, Goldman Sachs, Jeffries. Expect companies like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft to follow. I’ve unsubscribed from these services and products. </p>
<p>I’ve turned on Adblock for these sites so I can watch YouTube without them collecting ad revenue (<strong>Yes,</strong> <strong>it even works for YouTube</strong>). Support your subscribers directly on Patreon and ask them to upload content on other platforms so you can enjoy it. </p>
<p>In conclusion, a lot of these options are only available while the vaccine is not FDA approved. When the vaccine is approved we will have a much harder time to legally combat this, even though what hospitals have been doing for years with the flu shot seems borderline illegal to me. Let’s keep the ball rolling so that there is that much less of a foothold for the government when we get there.</p>
<p>I get that this post is probably late to the game for a lot of people, but I figured it’s better late than never. I just hope this helps someone to know what their rights are and how to reasonably flex them and defend themselves.</p></p>

        <p>If this thing gets approved as fast as they want it to. Considering it takes years and years of approval for other drugs. There has to be some loophole? The quickness in all of this has to be skipping the required testing?</p>

        <p>If these last years have shown us anything it's that if the government doens't like the rules, they'll just change them. I would expect FDA approval very shortly.</p>

        <p>They want it by fall! But they are skipping years and years of data! I would not trust it but many will and the fight will get worse! Now they will say it’s fully approved so we know it’s safe blah blah blah!!! Time to lawyer up now. Look at all the drugs that went through the long approval and they get pulled for far less injuries!!</p>
