    <strong>Just a few thoughts on 'saving grandma'</strong>
    <p><p>When the lockdown started, I was super pregnant, and I went to stay with out of town family for a few days just to visit. I talked to all of my family, my fiance, and wondered if it would still be safe to travel. They all said of course, people are just being cautious traveling by subway and such in cities. My fiance and I slowly watched the world unravel and joked that I ought to come home before leaving town is illegal. We figured it would last a few weeks. </p>
<p>The Sunday before "non - essential" stores shut down, my 88 year old grandmother and I went for breakfast, and went shopping for baby clothes. The winter before she broke her hip and was stuck indoors; after a few months, she was finally allowed to walk around normally again, and like most widowed elderly people, going to breakfast was her thing.</p>
<p>My mother, her daughter-in-law, lost her mind on me. Told me I was going to kill my unborn daughter (who is 6 months old, thriving, and sleeping at my breast right now). I was going to kill my grandmother- who invited me to go out with her.</p>
<p>10 years ago, my grandfather passed away. It was not a surprise. My grandmother mourned, and she continued living, but a bit differently. Understandably, her perspective changed a bit. When she began going out with friends and family for breakfast instead of eating in her now empty home, her doctor told her to stop because of her cholesterol levels. Her attitude was "I'm almost 80, I want to enjoy these few years." </p>
<p>She held onto that attitude as much as she could, but being forced indoors, isolated, has not been good for her mental health, which in turn affects her physical health. Her health is failing, and I'm sure that her sudden rapid decline has been due to being forced indoors. She has been trying to hold onto as much normalcy as possible. The salons are closed, but she has always had a friend do her hair. Her friend is elderly, and of the same mindset. They don't care about lockdowns. They don't care about masks. They know that if it isn't Covid, it will be a fall, or their kidneys, or hell, another random virus.</p>
<p>So, my grandmother's hairdresser tested positive for Covid. Because I have a young daughter, I didn't see my grandmother for the holidays. Her immunocompromised daughter did not. Christmas was postponed until she gets her (hopefully) negative test. It just makes me mad, and sad. My grandmother is showing no symptoms, and I'm praying she doesn't fall ill; her friend was asymptomatic. It makes me think, if we weren't testing everyone and their mother, we would have had Christmas for my grandmother. Her friend only gets tested for work. </p>
<p>On a less personal level, it's just made me think about who this is all supposedly for. The message is "Stay home, save Grandma, there's always next Christmas," but Grandma doesn't want to stay home. My grandmother is very lucky that she has family taking care of her, but what about the people in nursing homes, who haven't seen family since last Winter, who have died depressed and lonely, living their last days in isolation? Is this really worth it?</p></p>

        <p>Its for this exact reason I am home for Christmas right now. There might not be a next Christmas for my grandpa. So im here, I drove 12 hours across the province to get here, and I was going to be here because I promised I would be. I was making preparations to take side roads and round about routes to make sure I got home. They take what precautions they want, but there's no masks, no worries, they're just trying to enjoy their time before we have to deal with the rise of technocommunism.</p>
<p>Plus, my grandparents demanded I come home because they want to see me, and im not one to disappoint them if I can help it.</p>
