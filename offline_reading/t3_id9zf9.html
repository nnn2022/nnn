    <strong>Brooklyn Mother of 6 has family removed from flight when 2 year old wouldn't wear mask</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-mother-traveling-with-six-children-forced-off-jetblue-flight-20200819-bugfct2hkfelvjx7bov7ydzley-story.html">https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-mother-traveling-with-six-children-forced-off-jetblue-flight-20200819-bugfct2hkfelvjx7bov7ydzley-story.html</a></p>
<p>I'm heartened that the other passengers stuck up for this woman when the airline staff decided to take public health policy into their own hands and discriminate against a baby.</p>
<p>The reason a 2 year old can't wear a mask is because they'll choke on it. Shame on Jet Blue.</p></p>

        <p>These mask-nazis are the scum of the earth. Imagine abusing a family like this, all because the baby couldn't tolerate an obstruction over her airway. The cult of the face-diaper has gone too far, we've got to stop the madness. </p>
<p>The people who actually think bacteria-laden masks are hygienic are a fucking joke. This is the most unsanitary practice since chamber-pots.</p>

        <p>No, honestly, fuck that baby. You're telling me that babies don't have any problems wearing diapers that cover their entire ass, yet don't have the courtesy to wear a mask over their face during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC? Fuck that little hell-spawn for putting the life of my overweight, diabetic, paraplegic, Italian great grandmother of 95 years in jeopardy. She should be able spend multiple hours in a tightly packed tube full of hundreds of people without having to worry about catching COVID-19 because some selfish little child didn't wear a mask.</p>

The real vulnerable in this situation are children and families, being simultaneously starved and suffocated at the same time.

<p>The mandates tend to say only children under 2 are exempt.</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure why I'm downvoted. I've only ever seen laws say only children under 2 being exempted. If it's not so, give me examples of older kids being exempt.</p>

        <p>I don't keep up with other peoples laws, so here's the UK's guidance. Once you get past the fact a mask mandate exists in the first place, it's by far one of the most sensible as it's not on you to prove that you've got an exemption; it's a godsend for me as I can't wear a mask for medical reasons.

        <p>I was referring to the US, so should have specified that. But this is a very interesting read. Lemme post a part of interest here:</p>
<p><strong>When you do not need to wear a face covering</strong></p>
<p>&rt; In settings where face coverings are required in England, there are some circumstances where people may not be able to wear a face covering. Please be mindful and respectful of such circumstances, noting that some people are less able to wear face coverings, and that the reasons for this may not be visible to others.</p>
<p>&rt; This includes (but is not limited to):</p>
<p>&rt; * children under the age of 11 (Public Health England do not recommended face coverings for children under the age of 3 for health and safety reasons)</p>
<p>&rt; * people who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability</p>
<p>&rt; * employees of indoor settings (or people acting on their behalf, such as someone leading part of a prayer service) or transport workers (see section 6) - although employers may consider their use where appropriate and where other mitigations are not in place, in line with COVID-19 Secure guidelines</p>
<p>&rt; * police officers and other emergency workers, given that this may interfere with their ability to serve the public
where putting on, wearing or removing a face covering will cause you severe distress</p>

        <p>You missed this:</p>
<p>&rt;Those who have an age, health or disability reason for not wearing a face covering should not be routinely asked to give any written evidence of this, this includes exemption cards. No person needs to seek advice or request a letter from a medical professional about their reason for not wearing a face covering.</p>
<p>You can print or show the exemption card on your phone and as you can see, 'written evidence' includes exemption cards. So the whole thing is void anyway, just a compliance test to see who is a docile sheep.</p>

        <p>This doesn’t fly in the US at least. There was a big thing going through the news weeks ago about “mask exemption cards are illegal and not valid whatsoever”. The airlines no longer offer any exemptions, even if you do have a doctors note by chance. Most stores don’t. Gyms don’t where I am. No exemption card or guidance or wording in the mandates changes this, our govt has given them the okay to do this and leave those of us with disabilities in the dust. Where are the mass protests? I keep seeing stories like this and it makes me so angry. Then again I’m not doing anything myself other than not wearing when I’m able, but I kind of feel like I can’t do anything else on my own here</p>

        <p>Do airlines require a birth certificate to prove that your child is under 2? I ask because my child turns two in December and she will never wear a mask; that is the hill I will die on. But we may want to fly in January or February to visit my hometown versus driving the 8 hours in possible bad weather. I have no problem NOT flying but I'm just wondering if I can get away with saying she's under two since she would have just turned two by then...</p>

        <p>I think it's up to the individual airline. TSA does not require ID for children under 18, but airlines do have ID requirements for children. I traveled with children post 9/11 and even though I was told to bring a birth certificate they never did check it.</p>

        <p>I’d say kudos to those passengers for taking her side. It shows that there are still many not part of the hardcore mask or doomer hivemind. Shame on JetBlue, though. That was discrimination.</p>

        <p>Before covid, I was usually considered it wrong to blame employees for enforcing stupid rules and policies. My mom agreed, and we both got ticked off at my dad whenever he was rude to employees in these situations. "They're just doing their job," my mom and I would say, to which my dad would reply something to the effect of, "Not so fast. They represent the business, and they can choose what kind of representative they want to be."</p>
<p>100% on my dad's side now. There's a reason Nazi concentration camp guards are still being prosecuted for crimes against humanity even though they were 18 years old at the time and "just following orders."</p>

        <p>I hate this shit.  I have a 3 year old who won't wear a mask for more than 5 minutes, which means we are just completely barred from flying.</p>
<p>My parents are in their mid 70s and live on the other side of the country. We haven't seen them since December.  I'd love to go visit them, but it's too far to drive and we can't fly.  I seriously worry sometimes that if this goes on for several years my parents could die without me ever seeing them again.</p>

        <p>While it’s insane to expect toddlers to keep masks on, I’d recently took a JetBlue flight with my toddlers where they didn’t keep the masks on even for a minute and not one employee batted an eye, I had noticed some patterns in this article, who’s reporting it, the angle they’re pushing an access to lawyers ready to drop federal lawsuits🤔</p>

        <p>Interesting take, and I hope your experience is the more common one.   I have toddlers and feel like flying is just a roll of the die. Depending on how much of a nazi your flight attendants are they can crack down as they see fit.  Not worth taking the chance right now for me.</p>

        <p>It was honestly fine in my experience, JetBlue had it where the middle rows weren’t sold and even then the planes were maybe 1/3 full, the toughest aspect is trying to keep the kids from everyone else because you don’t know how these karens May react but it was actually very pleasant like I said all things considered.</p>

        <p>There is so much outright hatred and discrimination around children today. A lot of it is noise from the 'over-population' haters, but the virus has emboldened suckers the world around to gaslight kids. The library is still closed here (has been for months) and there is talk of opening all but the children's section. What a burden these kids have. Imagine if boomers were so openly reviled like this over a virus. <em>"Oh God, there's a boomer, got such a big head that mask isn't on right. I bet they got a flu shot and are pathenogenically primed to spread disease. Cross the street, we'll walk on the other side."</em></p>
<p>It would not stand. Why don't these haters pick on someone their own size? The only advocate these children have are us.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this on the big virus sub. The trolls and bots will downvote and report but I hate when the doomer chorus goes unchecked.</p>
