    <strong>Had a great experience today!</strong>
    <p><p>Went to a private owned gas station today and noticed the guy wasn’t wearing a mask</p>
<p>I walk up to the counter to check out and I say to him “you don’t care about masks.” </p>
<p>At first he thought I was being a Karen and telling him what he has to wear on his body </p>
<p>Than I pull my mask down. He smirks and says “no more corona” with an Indian accent </p>
<p>He’s got my business even if it costs a little more</p></p>

        <p>I wear a mask sometimes too, to avoid confrontation. </p>
<p>I try not to do that. It helps to remind myself of the choice I’m making: I’m choosing a little momentary convenience and comfort at the cost of helping to entrench the new normal. </p>
<p>When I view it in those terms, it becomes easier to make the right choice. Not always, but more often than if all I were thinking about is my desire to avoid confrontation. </p>
<p>(Fun fact: in all the times I’ve chosen to go maskless, I’ve never actually had any confrontation.)</p>

        <p>Those videos are exceptions. They are put online specifically because they are outrageous and unusual - and with the goal of causing the <em>exact</em> response you’re having. </p>
<p>You should really know better than to just believe everything you see online, and that includes believing that what you see online is representative of normal experiences.</p>

        <p>As much as you dont want to cause a scene.... Other people dont want to cause a scene either. </p>
<p>An old (liberal maybe?) Man at a coffee shop (of all free thinking places) told me I should wear a mask, not to my face and I barely noticed him. I kinda looked in his direction when he said it and mada face like i was trying to make out what he said and I couldnt hear him and he walked away without another word. </p>
<p>Ive also had people say "well we have free ones if you dont have one" to which I just say "im never coming back here".</p>

        <p>I really know how you feel. My partner is the same.
I hope by not wearing one that people can feel brave enough not to also.</p>
<p>Australia is very different now though, now the mandate is not in effect I think mask use is around ~30% in stores</p>

        <p>My rule of thumb is I won't be the only one with one and won't be the only one without one. </p>
<p>I've found that most gas station clerks in my area don't wear them so I don't wear them inside has stations. I do wear them in places like Costco that would freak out if you don't.</p>

        <p>Bad rule of thumb. Be the one without one to inspire the guy or woman like you used to be that they dont have to wear one either. </p>
<p>All lf us here know its bullshit right? </p>
<p>We dont owe anyone anything? 
We dont owe an explanation.</p>
<p>We dont need to be afraid of confrontation. If anything bad is said to you and you are afraid, you can just flat walk out without saying a single sylable in response (leave any merchendice not paid for).</p>
<p>Stores arent prisons and other customers arent prison guards. No one can contain you if a crime hadnt been commited and mask mandates are usually not enforceable. Id advise against sticking around long enough to get a law enforcement encounter. In my area I know sherrifs in different counties put out notice that they wouldnt enforce mask mandates unless if asked to leave, a customer refused to leave.</p>
<p>All you gotta do is leave (and if they dont want your business you SHOULD leave and never go back).</p>

        <p>I haven’t worn a mask more than maybe 10 times (and most of those because I was pregnant through most of the year and drs offices and the hospital wouldn’t let me in without one). I’ve never had anyone say anything. The most I’ve gotten is some looks of people moving out of my way while adjusting their mask lol</p>

<p>Lol. </p>
<p>Whenever you go to a store where people wear them and you arent wearing one and you see a rare person like you without a mask, you just seem to have this bonding moment i feel like... </p>
<p>.... Like "hey, you stranger without the mask... You and I probably have more in common than anyone else in this store right now"</p>
<p>Seriously... single folks, NOW is the time to flirt with like- minded folks and go on dates and pick up mates. </p>
<p>You will never have a better time to weed through.the dumb conformists and the individualists that think for themselves. </p>
