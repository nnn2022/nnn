        <p>Yeah it's wild. Today my Mom said she was thinking about getting the vaccine and then went on this long story about how she knows a bunch of women who are vaccinated and they all just got COVID. I had to repeat it back to her so she could hear the crazy. </p>
<p>It was fear that was getting her, and right now all the messaging is that if you want the fear to go away, you get the vaccine.</p>

You could be diagnosed with Covid and it could be something else or even nothing.</p>

I got the vaccine early on because I was trying to do the right thing.

        <p>Maybe as a knee jerk reaction, but I think the narrative is shifting to the vaccines just don’t work at all. The media is just setting themselves up to be a part of the side that doesn’t get dragged down when the inevitable happens. </p>

        <p>With an infection, the protein needs to pass the olfactory bulb to proceed into the brain. When vaxxed however, the spike protein is delivered to the brain directly by distribution of LNP's.</p>

        <p>Negative for natural infection, but much more negative for the injection, as that definiately distributes to the brain for neuological issues to occur long term, with a risk for prion disease (some are already emerging short term).</p>

        <p>A lot of reading and puzzling things together, as it won't be served on a platter. Everything I say here is comes from scientific papers, some are preprints. Though I'm not a library copying everything to provide people with. You should look them up yourselves (and actually convince yourself). If you seem not to find a study or 2, just give a shout and I''ll look if i can readily find it. But about each line herunder is about a different paper. Furtehrmore I make conclusions from several papers converging, which is pure logic, yet scientifically cutting corners.</p>
<p>Mice injected with sars2 died from spongeform encephalopathy (mad cow's) in 2 weeks, which correlates to 1.5 human years (the outcome is to be expected as from late winter 2022, I guess). Macaques were seen to die from Lewy Body Disease (related to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's). These are prion diseases to the brain. It means the virus gets through to the brain. Then it was researched that the spike protein from the virus was causing cardio-vascular issues, mainly causing destruction to the endothelial blood vessels. As the blood-brain barrier consists on itself by an endothelial lining, acting as a barrier between the blood vessels and brain tissue, it's clear to me to it's the spike protein breaking down the blood-brain barrier, causing leakage from the blood vessels into the brain tissue. Then prion domains were identified on the spike proteins S1 subunit. So it shouldn't be much of a guess to know what caused the mice and macaques die from these neurologic disorders. The spike protein doesn't only break down the BBB, being found in brain tissue of mice and macaques, it also holds the thr trigger to cause these prion diseases. Eventually, it is key to keep that spike protein from entering the brain tissue, in preventing those neurologic issues. With an inifection, which is thought to start off with about 100 to 10000's of virions, viral replication could halted and prevented with early treatment medicine (HCQ/IVM+zinc protocol), before the spike protein breaks through the BBB to cause enough leakage to infect the brain tissue with its the prion domains. But wit the novel vaccines however, the LNP's were shown by Japanese and European regulators, that they don't stay at the injection site, but distribute throughout the body including the brain. If LNP' s are spread to the brain, then mRNA will be having brain tissue replicate these spike proteins, with their prion domains, without even having to break down the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, novel vaxxes inject about 40 trillion mRNA per dose, of which about 75% spreads through the body including the brain. That's an unstoppable amount, as that mRNA hacks into the mechanism of ones own cells, suppressing the innate immune sytem and circumventing it. HCQ/IVM might stop viral cell protease (replication) from an infection, but it can't stop the mRNA mechanism.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the spike protein is bad. It is possible to keep replication from infection under control with early treatment. Yet the novel vaxxes inject a massive amount of unstoppable mRNA, partly directly delivered to the brain. Which make the vaccines even worse.</p>
<p>The possibility of prion domains inserted in viruses has been the holy grail in research for bioweapons for decades, as the enemy is slowly and unknowingly killed from neurological issues, with an unstoppable mechanism which could devastate entire nations. And now we're here.</p>

        <p>Yes. Vaccines protect against symptoms; ie vaccinated people need a higher viral load to show symptoms. But at lower levels of viral load they are asymptomatic and spreading.</p>
<p>Whereas as an unvaccinated person needs a lower viral load to show symptoms. In this case, they would stay home. But vaccinated people with the same viral load would spread just as much but not face any symptoms, and would this not stay home.</p>

        <p>The vaccine induced antibodies are unable to fight off different strains of the same virus, and in some cases the virus may use the antibodies to up its attack game. You can find more info from research studies pre-pandemic, specifically on vaccine trials for SARS and Dengue.</p>
