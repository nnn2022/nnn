<p>It's 100% self-aware.  The mentality I imagine is something along the lines of:  "Well,  I'm vaccinated and <em>clean</em> so I have a <em>right</em> to be here,  but these other people clearly don't!"</p>
<p>They don't have an excuse of just being unobservant.  They're just being shitty.</p>

        <p>It wasn't to protect to children.  It was to assuage the fears of teachers and to prevent children from becoming vectors of disease.</p>
<p>Of course, children were never significant enough vectors of disease to justify closures.  It was found that if teachers took precautions around other teachers, they were unlikely to catch it at work.  </p>

        <p>It also turned out to be mostly good for students, the parents were able to see how much rot there is in the school system. Especially on the crappy zoom school lessons, so many families have turned to homeschooling! A blessing in disguise. Hopefully the school system will be next to fall if society hasn't fully collapsed by the end of this year.</p>

        <p>Sure, because most people are capable of teaching their kid. The years of training teachers go through is actually pointless because the average joe is just as capable of teaching maths, chemistry, french, history and music as people who have studied those subjects and also studied and continue to study the surrounding pedagogy. 
For the record, kids being out of school while we were still unsure of the risks posed to both teachers and students alike was a good call to make from a safety standpoint.</p>

<p>If it was that easy then there would be no such thing as a bad teacher, yet everyone remembers that teacher that couldn’t explain things, or never seemed to know anything past what they’r planned for that lesson. </p>
<p>Like many things, when it’s done well it looks very effortless.</p>

        <p>You make the assumption that teaching must be done by a professional, that is appealing to authority. </p>
<p>I would argue that a concerned parent is more than capable of teaching their child how to read, write, and even calculate. </p>
<p>Learning is also a skill that is mastered through practice over time. I have taught myself many things over the years by being persistent, inquisitive and at times just a bit stubborn to work through a problem until its completion. I will teach my children the same.</p>
<p>I have even taught myself to draw a realistic drawing from just the copy in front of me. Sure the first few drafts were atrocious, but hey, when I repeated it a couple times and focused more, I came quite close.</p>
<p>I do not discount all teachers however, as I fondly remember several and really only a handful of those were exceptionally skilled at what they taught. To the point where I still use the skills they showed me all these years now.</p>
<p>But to immediately write off parents as being incapable is shortsighted. There is no one more interested in the wellbeing and education of a child than that child's own concerned parents. I would move mountains, and have, in my attempts to teach my own children at home since they were born. Their struggles were my struggles and I researched countless hours at night to find different methods to show them until one worked for my child. Can you say the same from a teacher in a class of 30+? It would be unfeasible for the teacher to do that times 30, so why is it expected then? Because of people like you who wash their hands of education as being out of their reach and must be done by a credentialed authority. Perhaps in smaller class size, but even at half that amount it can still get out of hand. </p>
<p>Worse still, the school system, at least in my area, has been forcing all students of all aptitudes together in the same class. How the hell can a teacher teach a special needs child, an average child and a more intelligent child all at the same time??? Not to mention the other children with behavioral issues who constantly disrupt the class??</p>
<p>No, I would posit that most parents are quite capable of teaching their own children at home. For those children on either extreme of the intelligence spectrum or simply behavioral issues, there are classes that cater to each group.</p>

        <p>I am not saying teaching must be done by a professional, simply saying that it’s far better if it is. </p>
<p>I am sure most parents can help a young child with spelling and arithmetic but what about teens studying algebra, geometry, natural sciences, history, literature etc.? The average person has forgotten most of what they learnt, let alone be able to teach that to someone. </p>
<p>Learning and teaching are rather different. Being able to sit and teach oneself does not make someone able to teach others, the main difference being the ability to communicate a concept without confusing the person by pitching too high, or boring by pitching too low. Many academics are rather bad lecturers as they cannot communicate what they are brilliant at.  </p>
<p>A teacher is able to teach 30 kids, some of high ability, some low, some with learning difficulties because they do it every day, are often a specialist in their subject holding at least a bachelors degree in it and constantly undergo professional development and work with a team of other teachers, teaching assistants, special educational needs specialists etc. </p>
<p>To claim that the average parent’s ability to teach is equal to that is daft. 
I’m sure most people can multiply 2 digit numbers on paper, explaining how to do that to a child who has never seen it done is rather more difficult, especially explain it in a way that leads naturally from what they currently know and make it easy to replicate then apply to unseen problems. That process becomes exponentially harder when you’re not 100% sure how that thing works yourself e.g. most people would struggle to work out x and y from 
2x + 4y = 16, 3x + 5y = 21 which is something learned at age 14… try explaining the process of solving it to a 14 year old when you’re struggling to do so yourself.  </p>
<p>That’s where most kids have really struggled in the pandemic, those close to GCSE and A Level exams (or the country equivalent) where parents really cannot help as they lack the knowledge.</p>

        <p>I'm not far off from my tenure in public school, and I can tell you that you must have had an exceptionally rare teacher for every year if you think that one teacher can teach the same material to a spectrum of learners at the same time. It is impossible. The lower learners need more attention at the expense of the medium and higher levels. I know, because I experienced it and my parents put me in the best public schools they could find. I was correcting my teachers from as early as 3rd grade in various subjects. My teachers, though meaning well, could not teach me at the level I required because they were always dealing with the slower students and those who would lash out in class and run around refusing to do their work or sit still.</p>
<p>Like you mentioned, being able to communicate helps and how else will you be able to do that but try? Again, my point is that a concerned parent who will naturally be attentive to their child's needs, will do what they can to ensure their child learns well.</p>
<p>There are countless tools online for teaching algebra, geometry, etc for students to utilize. Have you never heard of Khan Academy? Free online math help, YouTube also has tons of videos to help explain various concepts for those who need it. A concerned parent would seek those out to help teach their child, and there is nothing more beneficial than positive attention from the child's parent to help them succeed.</p>
<p>There are also various methods to homeschooling, it does not have to look like a student seated at a desk with a blackboard in front. Learning and teaching can happen anywhere. On a nature walk, searching for different plants and insects to identify. At the park swings, learning about physics.</p>
<p>There are also co-ops where a few days a week can be in a class lab for science courses where parents switch out duties, or just groups of families pooling money for a tutor. Those were called school pods during the height of the shutdowns. The amount of curricula available to teach all those high level courses are all available online or to purchase book sets and done at home. </p>
<p>It has been years since I first learned algebra and geometry, but there's no reason why I cannot also pick it up as I go along showing my child.</p>
<p>I can see creditentialed teachers having a place in teaching those children of special needs, but for the average student, homeschooling would be just as good or better. For the few high level learners, homeschooling allows them the option to seek out programs more suitable for their needs.</p>
<p>A public school cannot commit to such level of detail, again, that was my experience as a gifted student. The supposed accelerated program was still not sufficient and suffered from the same problem: trying to teach the same material to 30+ students of various levels of attention.</p>

        <p>Yeah, if there isn’t a worldwide pandemic going on, Also your right to travel is restricted, NOT banned. That means  you can go to Germany and other places in Europe for a business trip. But not for a vacation trip.  https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/214098345.pdf</p>

<p>We're still talking about the common cold, right? Like, sniffle, sniffle?</p>
<p>No, my friend, each nation which has implemented lockdowns, travel restrictions, coerced vaccination are in breach of the Declaration of Human Rights, the Nuremberg Code and their own constitution. The leaders responsible must be held accountable.</p>
<p>But, don't take it from me. Look at Spain, which indeed did declare the lockdown last year unconstitutional, but let the criminals go on a technicality.</p>

        <p>Okay. But here’s a sentence taken from the article: “Since then, more than 81,000 people in Spain have died with coronavirus.”</p>
<p>What’s more valuable? Your right to leave the country? Or more than 81,000 people’s lives? Tell us we’re sheep all you want, but know you’re sacrificing people in the name of protecting your right to travel. Kinda selfish honestly</p>

<p>Freedom and basic human rights.</p>
<p>Our grandfathers died in actual wars to protect and maintain it, while here we are throwing it all away over the flu.</p>
<p>As for the statistics, we've gone over that countless times over the last one and a half year. So if you haven't done your homework there, I really can't help you.</p>

A marginal change didn’t allow people to fly to see their sick relatives during a fake pandemic. A marginal change made people wear masks when they aren’t sick and closed down schools for kids who aren’t even affected by covid. Fuck your marginal change.</p>
