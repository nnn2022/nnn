    <strong>Questions for a Holocaust Survivor</strong>
    <p><p>I live with a 97 year old Polish Holocaust Survivor, and I'll be interviewing him this week (tonight or tomorrow, hopefully) regarding everything going on in the world today. </p>
<p>With so few Survivors left in the world, this is a really unique and important opportunity to get the perspective of a link to the very past that many of us see repeating.</p>
<p>Post any questions you'd like to know about, but be warned: I am going to take great steps to make this as non-biased and un-influenced as possible, so I will only be asking open ended questions that are <em>not</em> leading.</p>
<p>So i may re-word your questions to make them less biased in perspective, but I'll ask all legitimate questions I can.</p>
<p>Note: I will be recording on video and posting to YouTube, so you'll get to see the man react to and answer your questions. </p>
<p>I will also not edit the video in any way, so it may be very long. But again, this is a unique opportunity. I'm not going to cut anything.</p>
<p>Edit: I am already working on a series of videos detailing his incredible and unbelievable life story.</p>
<p>I would like these questions to focus solely around the events happening today. If he draws any parallels, they are his own</p></p>

        <p>I actually learned about the Holodomor recently. They have some accounts of survivors, but it was not documented nearly as much as it should have been. That’s a good reminder to do what we can in preserving the stories of people who are still here.</p>

        <p>Yeah its so messed up that we have the holocaust shoved down our throats, but the holodomor is even worse with nearly quadruple the deaths. And its not like its some far away peoples it happened to, america is full of slavic/eastern european descendants. </p>
<p>I think one reason why its not discussed is because it was committed by bolshevik communists and currently a lot of academia is with that party and or aligned with it</p>

        <p>It’s not at all messed up that we have the Holocaust “shoved down our throats,” it’s messed up that we don’t also pay the same attention to the Holodomor. </p>
<p>One factor is probably that humans have enslaved people and worked them to death forever, but afaik the custom-designed murder camps combined with a successful propaganda campaign to divide an already-integrated society was a new level for humans. Similar factors result in a better record of the Holocaust than of the Holodomor; the way that Nazis executed the Holocaust left ample evidence, both horrifying (the physical camps, designs for mass gas chambers, documentation of evil “experiments,” etc) and deeply tragic (piles and piles of children’s shoes, tattoos, etc). </p>
<p>I’m a big believer that once you get into “millions murdered” territory, there’s no “which was worse” - they’re all fucking horrific. But the Holocaust was <em>innovatively</em> evil, so to speak, and well-designed for remembrance due to the central organization, planning, propaganda campaigns, etc. </p>
<p>Oh, I learned of the Holodomor in one of the socialist/communist subs (don’t recall which one). Someone brought it up, and a socialist quickly explained that those people weren’t murdered, they just died of a famine that everyone suffered from. I hadn’t heard of the Holodomor before, so I did some googling and wound up on a website documenting some statements of survivors, describing the hell they endured. I’ve since come across several more people in those subs who insist that the Holodomor was just a natural disaster, and it always reminds me that collectivists are fucking evil. They started taking over classrooms and schools in the 70s, so yeah, that’s probably a big part of why most people don’t know about the Holodomor.</p>

        <p>They are both bad. One is over taught with embellishments, and one is under taught (as in never), with minimization when it is brought up. </p>

        <p>Ask him about Poland’s standing with Germany. Before and after WW1 and 2.</p>
<p>What are his opinions on Jewish-Bolshevik uprising that occurred before world war 1 in Russia?</p>
<p>Did he live in Nazi Germany?</p>
<p>How did he escape/when was he freed by the allied forces?</p>
<p>What was the propaganda like on both sides? </p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I know my questions are all over the place, but I’m more interested in the events leading to WW2 rather than during.  I have a feeling that history was warped (the victors write the history and all that), hopefully this opportunity would bring enlightenment.</p>

        <p>Well post on this sub when it’s up. We lived with my grandfather growing up, he fought in Italy. So few people around still from that era. It’s always fascinating to me.</p>

Specifically the events of 1/6 and anything surrounding the election?
