    <strong>Governments are lying to you. COVID-19 didn't start spreading in 2020.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in North America. In DEC. of 2019, I was struck by a sudden, really strange illness. </p>
<p>At first, I assumed it was a normal flu, so didn't think twice about it. Fever. Headaches. Tiredness. Bunch of symptoms. This flu was unusual because I was <em>really</em> tired for a whole week, which had never happened to me before. Going to the grocery store was difficult. Standing on my feet was hard.</p>
<p>It was kind of scary, because COVID-19 wasn't a thing over here back then, so I spent quite a few days wondering what was happening to me. I fully recovered after about 10 days. And no, I didn't have to go to the hospital. I just stayed home and rested.</p>
<p>It's only a few months later, when public panic struck that I sort of clicked. Wow, <em>I had COVID-19</em>. </p>
<p>Funny how it wasn't a national emergency until the WHO and politicians said so?</p></p>

        <p>I believe I had it in October of 2019. Which I know is super early to claim having it, but I was sick for about two months with something really unusual, and when I went to urgent care, they straight up TOLD me “yeah, we’ve been seeing this a lot lately, we don’t really know what it is.”</p>

        <p>I talked to somebody who works for a company that does a lot of work  with a Chinese company and this person told me that the people in the Chinese company talked about an unknown illness already in September of  2019 and they thought it could become a big problem and develop into a  pandemic.<br>
Don't know how credible the person is I talked to, but I  find it odd. Also think about the strange "vaping illness" last year in  the US. It was in August and September 2019. <br>
The New York Times had a big story about it. </p>

        <p>We already have documented CoVid-19 infections in New Mexico and Nevada in early SUMMER 2019.</p>
<p>Yeah, it did not start spreading in 2020. Wuhan was the first large outbreak but I personally think it was going around like a year before that outbreak around the world and it finally mutated in the proper way to infect lots of people.</p>

        <p>Absolutely do agree with you and I think it was around in the US in mid-2019, I know I got sick because my entire family had it... I had a really bad cough, runny nose, congested chest and just felt tired and achy.... I remember having to take a week off work and I was good after that, didn't see a doctor and didn't go to the hospital either, just took it easy, drank tea, ate soup and took it easy... I know I didn't have loss of taste but since my nose was congested my sense of smell wasn't as sharp</p>

        <p>In 1994 I had a bad flu and couldn't get out of bed for two weeks. My throat took two months to get back to normal. Was this the great god covid... or just a normal damned flu! I never went to the quack, but just let my immune system deal with it! Nowadays everything is "the plague". Idiot bedwetters! All these precious snowflakes that if they cough, they immediately go to the doctor like they are going to die tomorrow. The flu has been around for as long as people have (and it has been bad occassionally): there is nothing new! Get a grip ffs!</p>

        <p>I was really laid out back in '86. Bedridden - no sense of smell, aches, fever. Hallucinations, speaking in tongues and the hospital couldn't isolate the problem. Many blood tests and organ transplants. Even today I look a bit like that Jack o Lantern Character in the nightmare before Easter. I'm pretty sure it was covid. Everyone in my family got it. All the fat people died. My older relatives all died. The young ones survived. But , who knows? Maybe it was aids or Sars or Ebola? Maybe some food poisoning from all the candy I ate that Halloween. I miss my relatives we piled up into the mass grave. But the inheritance was pretty great. I mean, here we were, the 3 of us getting everything handed down from the extended family. Money can buy you love, at least an hour at a time. Have a great weekend!</p>

        <p>I was really laid out back in '86. Bedridden - no sense of smell, aches, fever. Hallucinations, speaking in tongues and the hospital couldn't isolate the problem. Many blood tests and organ transplants. Even today I look a bit like that Jack o Lantern Character in the nightmare before Easter. I'm pretty sure it was covid. Everyone in my family got it. All the fat people died. My older relatives all died. The young ones survived. But , who knows? Maybe it was aids or Sars or Ebola? Maybe some food poisoning from all the candy I ate that Halloween. I miss my relatives we piled up into the mass grave. But the inheritance was pretty great. I mean, here we were, the 3 of us getting everything handed down from the extended family. Money can buy you love, at least an hour at a time. Have a great weekend!</p>

        <p>I believe myself and several coworkers had it around Thanksgiving of 2019. One of my coworkers that was 65 was out sick for a full week, had not previously called out sick in 13 years. He said it was a different illness that he has never experienced and he had zero energy. Myself I did not miss work (I couldn’t), but I had severe fever, headache and zero energy for 2 weeks. I felt awful aside from that. Several others before and after this were out of work with awful flu like symptoms that they described as “feeling different”.</p>

        <p>This is common knowledge (now). I remember back in dec 2019/jan 2020 the government refused to test unless you'd returned from china. how could you know theres no cases if you didn't test. and then later of course they found out it was circulating in seattle pre 2020</p>

        <p>I know these are all anecdotal, but if there are enough of them, it's at least more and more plausible. I may have had it too. After my parents came home from holiday in February, all 3 of us had a really weird cold/flu, we all had a cough, which was dry from the start and lasted for more than a week, even 10 days. Otherwise, I actually may have had the worst version, I felt really bad for 2 days, though I often have very little trouble with colds, had fever and felt very tired constantly. On the 3rd day I was suddenly back at 90-95% it seemed, only the cough, as I said, lingered. My mom had the least severe version. My dad was in between, btw he's llke Trump, in his 70s and overweight. We are all perfectly fine now, no "long covid" or anything.</p>

        <p>I had one of my worst cases of the flu in January 2020 when I was in Canada. 2 days sick there and 2 days sucks when I got back home. Wore a mask even when leaving US because ironically, I didn't wanna get sick. But I took an antibodies test a few weeks ago and it came back negative. So who really knows what I had (I don't get sick often and when I do it never feels like how it felt then)</p>

        <p>I think there's a possibility of myself  and my kids having it in January. We all got what I just thought was bad chest colds at the time, but our coughs were horrendous and lasted forever. Like worse than it's ever been for myself. My kids are young so coughing bad usually makes them throw up anyway, but for myself.. my coughing kept me up a lot of nights and I almost passed out a couple of times b/c that need to cough feeling wouldn't let up.</p>
<p>None of us ever got fevers over 99 though so never bothered going to a doctor for it. Other than the really bad coughing, we were ok.. just cold symptoms.</p>

        <p>I 100% believe me &amp; my church family lost our eldest member to Covid in November.
They said they had a weird uptick of "Legionnaires Disease" in the elderly as of lately &amp; they didn't know why.
She developed pneumonia a few days before she died.
We went &amp; saw her in the hospital like the night before she died. Then a few months later, they start talking about Covid 19. None of this clicked in my head until a few months ago when we were talking about her &amp; her symptoms &amp; how quickly it took her.</p>

        <p>Caught it in Dec 2019 from visibly sick Chinese tourists - they were coughing and red-faced with fever. Don't let anyone tell you they always wear masks when sick. For me, it wasn't terrible but deff the sickest I've been since I was in school. I spread it to my landlord's renovation crew (shared a bathroom and I never heard a single one of them wash their hands) and the oldest sickest guy had to go to the hospital because he was having so much trouble breathing. Spent the rest of the winter listening to it rip through the tourist town where I was working. A lot of us have probably had it.</p>

<p>My boss had it 3mo ago... exept he worked through it. Granted he ead a misreable mess, but a week and a half later he was done with it.... his kid got it and got tested by thier school, which basically confirms it in my mind. Take note that my boss is overweight, elderly, and severly abused recreationsl stimulants in the 80's. Hes prime time "at risk" demographic and he did manual labor everyday while he had the vid.</p>

        <p>I'm sure I had it right around Christmas and New Years. It was documented in China in October or November of 2019.... with how fast it spreads it makes sense that a lot of the US population would have caught it around then.</p>

        <p>I had a very similar experience in early January. My friend got sick with a very bad “flu”, of course this was before covid was announced. I ended up getting sick too. It was like a flu, with a lot of covid symptoms now that I look back. Of course I didn’t freak out and got over it with water, ibuprofen, and saltines. But I’m with you, a lot of people I know had similar instances with a flu-like sickness in December/January.</p>

        <p>I do believe COVID was spreading around in 2019.</p>
<p>I did get mild-flu like symptoms for a few days in Feb 2020 or so. It’s rare for me to get ill but something got me. Standard timeline, sick for one day but getting better the next day. Something was odd though - I just couldn’t shake off the runny nose.</p>
<p>It’s likely to have been another virus but you never know. Maybe I should take an antibody test.</p>

        <p>did you lose your sense of taste and smell? i was in your boat at the same time, and my first unusual symptom was losing my sense of taste and smell. very very odd. took me a whole month to feel 100% again, too! </p>
<p>the worst moment for me is one i don't even remember - apparently one night, in the middle of a raging fever, i rolled over, shook my husband awake, and told him that i wanted Jesus to take me to Nana, then dropped back down on the bed. he said he was like "uhhhh jesus fucking christ, she's so sick she wants to die."</p>

        <p>i have the same symptoms every year, because of allergies. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>also, the virus became noticed because of it's fast spreading and deadly effectiveness. If no one died, you got okay after some days, it wasn't spread quickly and you didn't even needed medical attention then that most likely means a cold or allergy.</p>

        <p>I had a really nasty flu for about a week in October of 2019. Vomited on and off for a couple days. Then the two days of doing nothing but sleep. And the headache that just wouldn't go away, even after everything else did. Kept worrying I had a brain tumour. After I think 8 days all was back to normal. It was odd. Lost about 10lbs from having zero appetite.</p>

        <p>i'm not a troll, i was as sick as a dog in December 2019. and i have gotten an antibody test and guess what? i didn't have antibodies. because if i was sick in December and tested in April, there might not be any antibodies to pick up. however, my doctor said that it's very possible i still had covid-19 but my t-cell response was robust. t-cells are the security bouncers of the body!</p>

        <p>&rt;The virus has been detected in sewage collected in Spain in March 2019</p>
<p>So a highly contagious virus caused virtually no excess deaths during early 2019 in to late 2019 but did spread around the world, then started killing people like crazy in China around early 2020 and then the rest of the world?  Really does not make sense.  A virus related to SARS which also started in China but barely spread out of the region 2 decades ago.  With Covid, from infection to dead (assuming you die) it takes about 21 days (last I looked into it).</p>
<p>"“The levels of SARS-CoV-2 were low but were positive,”
"There was the potential for a false positive due to the virus’ similarities with other respiratory infections."</p>
<p>&rt;It was SPREADING already in NY at LEAST a month earlier than the first "official" case was diagnosed in March 2020. </p>
<p>I'm sure it was spreading in Feb 2020.  Considering it peaked out around April 1st in NY.  And NY is a hub for all sorts of international travel.</p>
