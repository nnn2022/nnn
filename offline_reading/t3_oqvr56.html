    <strong>A great podcast discussing the controversy around Ivermectin and the wholesale censoring of valuable data and testing results.</strong>
    <p><p>Joe Rogan talks to Bret Weinstein &amp; Dr Pierre Kory about evidence that Ivermectin alone can provide herd immunity with a 70% uptake, the absurdity of the approach the world has taken, the problems with Fauci, the silencing of experts who speak out.</p>
<p>It appears Bret would feel right at home here -</p>
<p>&rt;The official policy is vaccines at any cost, get everybody on them and don't talk about other stuff... and none of it makes any sense because just consider the anomalies - Why is it that everybody who's vaccine skeptical is called a crazy person? I don't think they are because I'm vaccine skeptical and I don't mean that generally, I'm very enthusiastic about vaccines, but in this case I'm worried about a set of vaccines that were sped through the (testing) process, where their manufacturers are immunized against liability and where there is a very strong signal that something is not right.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Why is it that you have a population of very vaccine hesitant people, however they got there, even if they got there via confusion and we're trying to reach herd immunity in order to drive the pathogen to extinction; where this drug appears to give people immunity to a large extent, maybe a complete extent - Why are we not giving Ivermectin to those who won't take the vaccine, who can't take the vaccine or to whom the vaccine will not reach? <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Even if you [the government] believed that the vaccine was far and away the best solution to this problem, all of those categories would benefit from having Ivermectin and the population as a whole would benefit because it would leave fewer people for this pathogen to jump to and yet we don't do it.</p>

<p>Sorry but this is on Spotify, but if you watch it you'll soon realize that this would have been wiped instantly if it were on Youtube.</p></p>
