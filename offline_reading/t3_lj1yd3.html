    <strong>So I flew to Florida last week.... these airlines have gone absolutely insane</strong>
    <p><p>Had to fly to Florida last week on business. It had been a month or two since the last time I did, which last time was annoying but nothing like this. </p>
<p>Show up to the airport and put my buff/neck gaiter up over my face. On checking in at the American Airlines desk, I’m informed that neck gaiters no longer count as masks and I need to wear a surgical mask. Tell them that the gaiter is all I have and it was fine last time I flew. Get some line about how the “science has changed” and they offer me a surgical mask. Whatever, gotta get to my meeting so I take it.</p>
<p>Get on the plane and we take off. I bought a bag of chips in the terminal so I start eating them. Legit not even trying to not comply, had just started eating them. Flight attendant comes over and asks that while I’m chewing I wear the mask and only take it off to put chips in my mouth. Shit.you.not.... that’s what she said. I just stared at her like she was retarded without saying a word, then said fuck it and put the chips away.</p>
<p>A couple rows up, dude was sleeping and his mask fell down below his nose. Same flight attendant literally woke him up to tell him to pull his mask up.</p>
<p>All this feigned virtue signaling and “concern”, yet the flight was 100% full. Why was it full despite less traveling? Because American has reduced connections and canceled flights to keep their planes full. I’ve traveled throughout the pandemic, and I remember in the beginning when people legit didn’t know how bad it was the planes were intentionally reducing how many people were allowed on board and making people only sit in every other row and stuff like that. Now the planes are 100% full which is somehow okay, but they’ll bitch if your mask is down for a second.... makes sense lol.</p>
<p>Of course, the irony was that upon arriving to Florida maybe 40% of people were wearing masks overall and everything was open. Had a nice business dinner inside and hit a few bars. On my return home I opted for the 7 hour drive instead of flying and rented a car. So sick of this shit.</p></p>

        <p>My dude, they won almost a decade ago.</p>
<p>The media has directed the public into one illogical stance after another, time and time again, using the fear of Cancel Culture as a cudgel.  </p>
<p>The public thinks whatever their TV tells them to think, because if they don’t, the Media will descend on them, calling them an -istophobe and getting them fired from the their jobs, or worse.</p>

        <p>I am so scared every time I go into a store without a mask. It seems stupid an silly but the social shaming makes me so anxious. I go in without a mask anyways because I know it is right and it's important for people and especially my child to see normal but each time I fear I will end up being in some person's video and my family and friends will see an not talk to me anymore. I try to remember just to be calm and kind but firm if confronted and so far it's worked but it is hard for me. I envy people like my husband who just dgaf.</p>

        <p>Your honesty is refreshing.  To keep your mind focused, I recommend practical meditation. It's also prudent to calculate the risk.  Even Gandhi built a movement behind him before he tried to take on the British government.  When you're training for a marathon, you don't run a marathon every day.  You push yourself, then take a break to recuperate.  The key is to keep improving. You're stronger than you know.</p>
<p>Tanzania, Nicaragua are friendly to your current beliefs.  There are many states that have much more welcoming populations.  The rural areas in pretty much all of North America have proven to be more resistant.  I'm strongly against guns, murdering animals, american culture, the military and religion; however, I'm in Georgia right now, because it's better than Michigan.</p>

        <p>Typical arrogant american.  Your response is completely predictable.  You assume that somehow you have more of a right to live in america because  you subscribe to a certain set of malignant values.  You have a delusional god-complex, and you truly believe you own the universe.  I have as much a right to live in america as you, but since I live an ethically superior life, I actually have more of a right to tell you to leave.  You can kindly go back to Europe where you belong.  Good luck with your self-destructive disposable empire.</p>

        <p>Those stores are being coerced into doing so. I know business owners who only put the sign up because they couldn't afford the fines if they did not. If a private business wants me to leave I do and take my business elsewhere. Where I am from there is beautiful lake. Gas stations and restaurants around and in the summer people come in and out of those places in swimsuits and it's great. If someone in D.C. wanted to suddenly fine those places for allowing that no one would comply because it is not a problem.</p>

        <p>No, I just think that you consume media that is designed to scare you. As they say, never assume something is malicious when it can be explained by ignorance. I think the worst thing that I would assume about you is that you are self centered and have a big ego.</p>

        <p>So we're all self centered for not wanting to wear a mask? The hell does that make you? We should wear a mask for <em>your</em> protection, should we not?

You came here to rag on someone who's scared of the Cancel Culture, fearing they might be shunned by their family if they don't wear a mask, and you choose to berate them for being scared?

        <p>So do you think I am stupid or ignorant? I would say a stupid person can't be ignorant. Ignorance implies a choice. I am assuming you have talked to people before with the same beliefs as me that started citing Infowars and linking you to YouTube videos? I have been thinking for a long time now about the role government should play in our lives and weighing pros and cons. I have tried to read about it from many different books and sources and I would love to recommend you some if you will take them. Maybe you have already read them and in that case you may know my line of thinking and can give me some alternatives because I feel like I am missing something huge in this promask mandate argument that seems to be just flying over my head</p>

        <p>Here's my take. Ideally the government shouldn't have to issue a mask mandate, I would be wearing a mask while I'm out whether someone told me to or not. But since on the whole, Americans are, as I said earlier, self centered and ignorant (whether that be willful or not), it is neccessary for some level of guidance from the government.</p>

        <p>It hasn’t. If you just google it you’ll get hundreds of <em>actually reputable</em> studies that show how it’s not. It’s people like you that go on about this fake research and spread misinformation that are the reason it’s gotten so out of control.
Don’t you think scientists studying this topic for over a year now would know more about it than you?</p>

        <p>You know, you and I may very well have a completely different foundation of morality which means our definitions of "right" will differ. So if none of what I tell you makes sense, we might have to go down a more philosophical/religious road. </p>
<p>Reading a book called Pioneer Girl right now by a pioneer named Laura Ingalls Wilders she was a lifelong Democrat until Roosevelt came along and federal agents started showing up at small farms owned for decades without any problems fining them and taxing them. It is a tale as old as time. When you give people further away from you more power they understand your struggles less and care less about you as a person. People are not wired to make choices taking into consideration millions of individuals scattered across thousands of miles. It is impossible to choose right for everyone. </p>
<p>"follow the science then," is usually the next step. As a child I had hydrocephalus, if my mom hadn't listened to the opinion of a minimum wage day care worker who insisted there was something off she wouldn't have taken me to a third doctor who finally said I needed surgery ASAP. I have family that had pancreatic cancer and were told by their doctor it was a potassium deficiency for a year. As a child I was prescribed Singulair for seasonal allergies. Side effect? Depression and suicidal thoughts. At 14 I made the choice of my owns accord to eat healthier and go outside more and never had seasonal allergies again and no side effects. The hospital I was born at and went to my entire life up until 30 years ago was STERILIZING Native American women without their consent. Under the CDC. Opioids have torn my community apart, sent to us by the health industry. anecdotal to you which is why I won't ask you to change your mind, but these people have caused my family and community a lot of harm.</p>
<p>As a newborn my baby would stick his tongue out if you stuck yours out. Auto immune diseases are on the rise, as well as depression and childhood obesity. I can see it all around me. Some people go outside in a sea of masks, go home watch people in make up on TV and see filtered pictures on social media. Never see a face. I have thought maybe in countries where women cover their faces that's why violence is so high against women because if all you ever see are a couple of faces of women your whole life, it may be somewhat easy to dehumanized them (but I am a covidiot, so you know my thoughts are fairly low iq). Faces at important to us. We see them in things that aren't even real faces like clouds and trees. We do not know what such a sterile and faceless world will do to our children and won't for many years. </p>
<p>And millionaires in D.C. want to tell me what is best and I just can't trust them anymore. It is too personal.  I would not let somebody who consistently hurt me growing up have any say in how I raise my child and the government is no different.</p>

        <p>I drove to an extra 3 jewelry stores today before I found one that didnt have a disgusting sign on the front door saying something irrational about mask requirements.</p>
<p>Imagine being forced to wear a mask in a jewelry store? This world is fucked. It makes me think vile thoughts about the things that could take place with this being the new norm. </p>
<p>I spent my budget at a jewelry store that didnt have a sign up about masks. That's how it goes. </p>
<p>My local corner store I've been going into for 5+years started asking people to wear masks but they've never said anything to me in the last 15 months and I've never put one on. </p>
<p>I cant even count how many establishments I've written off completely due to their nonsense. </p>
<p>My local hardware store for one. An employee took it upon himself to follow me through the store, about 2-4 feet behind me, for about 15 minutes. Making snide remarks such as "I see you're still not wearing a mask" or responding to my question of where an item is with a short and simple "I dont know".</p>
<p>Imagine that person. That's a bad person on the inside. That's a person that we know, factually, can never be trusted. </p>
<p>Do not associate with voluntary maskers.</p>

Even if you have become the last man standing VS the rest of the planet never give up, make your spirit unbreakable.

        <p>Masks are mandated where I'm from, if you don't wear one in a store you'll get a fine and in the very worst case, arrested. Although I don't think that ever happens. So everyone wears one ofcourse, nobody wants a fine. I just stopped wearing one a few weeks ago. I don't care anymore about the looks or even the fine if they choose to do so, I'm sick of it.</p>

        <p>This is where I’m torn. At any private business such as Walmart, wherever, I believe in their rights. If they want me to wear a pink tutu on Tuesday to be able to shop, they should be allowed to. Same with masks. So I want to respect their rights, I mean I don’t have to shop there, but I also don’t want to help feed into this mask wearing bullshit. </p>
<p>Fuck. </p>
<p>I’ve started asking if they care, or if it’s just corporate and they have to have the signage. Depending on their answer is what I do.</p>

        <p>I haven't worn a mask yet, but I already feel much shame that I will wear one for the first time to fly to Tanzania.  I looked into alternative methods, but they aren't really practical.  I might have paid up to 10K for a chartered seat, but I think I would have to charter an entire plane for much more.  I can almost build a small school with 8K in East Africa.  Remember, a strategic withdrawal isn't the same thing as a loss.</p>

<p>American Airlines only cares about virtue signaling and revenue. Even when I flew in June,  when there were even less people traveling, the plane was 100% full. It helps them save money.</p>

        <p>Fly Delta. They're still keeping middle seats open in most rows which is amazing for a number of reasons. No awkward armrest contention, no getting spilled on/crushed by a fat fuck, no competition for carry-on space, no obnoxious "we're at capacity, can people please go check their bags" right before the flight, faster loading/unloading, etc.</p>
<p>They also haven't been too bitchy about masks the few flights I've taken. Didn't bother anyone with a mask below their nose, only if it was completely removed. If you're eating or drinking they say nothing. </p>
<p>I'll continue to pay $200-300 more to fly Delta until this changes.</p>

        <p>I've flown Delta many times during this nightmare and they have been very strict on masks. I was woken up when the mask slipped beneath my nose and on one flight I was wearing a surgical mask (I'm a surgeon and know how to wear it 😉)and three stewardesses hovered over me analyzing my mask fit, complete w a 5 minute debate between them as to if it was good enough.</p>

        <p>I agree. However, there’s obviously a time and place for “revolting” though. I can tell someone at a grocery store to fuck off and ignore them, worst case I get banned from the store and can go elsewhere. I can’t “revolt” against airlines when I have to travel for business, getting put on a no fly list would make my job exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>I do the same. Worst instance so far, the lady at the door said it was "required", I said "no thanks" kept walking. She followed me and kept bothering me. She said the police may come and have me removed, I said "I guess we'll see." Bought my one item and left without anyone hassling me anymore.</p>

        <p>I can analyze the data.  When an intervention is put into place such as masks you expect to see the rate of change behave differently.  We don’t see that anywhere. The curves do not waver one bit.  The masking of the general public has had no effect.</p>

        <p>Between April 8th and May 15th.  We saw a seasonal drop in coronavirus at that time of year heading towards the end of spring.  Remember coronaviruses are sharply seasonal.
Testing wasn’t even in full swing during that time.  That’s a worthless study.  </p>

        <p>Then why didn't the case count drop in states that didn't mandate masks? Seems pretty elementary to me, if the seasons change it should drop everywhere, plus southern states like Florida got hot quickly and still had plenty of cases. Why's that?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've accepted that my international travel goals will foregone unless these mask requirements are lifted. I haven't worn a mask over the last year, and I'm not going to start. I just won't participate in any activity or business where I'm required to, and that's fine with me. Thankfully I live in a state that respects my right to decide for myself.</p>

        <p>I try not to and now will try harder not to. Even before covid if it was under ~5 hours I’d just drive sometimes. Now I’m pretty much always driving if my trip is under 6, and sometimes have driven longer than that just to not have to deal with the hassles of flying.</p>

        <p>Yeah flying, covid or no covid has always been pretty heinous, and outrageously expensive, even when I was an airline employee, I could fly pretty much anywhere for free or for a incredibly low price and I still didnt. Its sad because id love to visit my friends and basically extended family in oregon but looks like if I ever want to do that Ill be doing a road trip.</p>

        <p>It's about forcing you to conform. By wearing the neck gaiter, which is something you could wear anyway to keep warm, you indirectly show how you refuse to play along, and they resent it.</p>
<p>It's the same here in the UK at supermarkets. They added mask bouncers who will only let you in if you wear a mask, or wear a lanyard saying you are exempt. Why do you need to wear a lanyard? It does nothing to stop the virus. The reason is, it is a symbol, just like the mask, that you are submitting to the collective and that you are conforming.</p>

        <p>They're treating this pandemic the same way they treat climate change: put all the responsibility on the individual in order to absolve themselves. </p>
<p>They insist that the pandemic is being exacerbated by the "personal choice" of anti-maskers when they are still refusing to grant paid sick leave and still kicking people out of their homes. </p>
<p>It reminds me of how these companies and the media they've bought continue to insist that climate change is not the fault of the 100 companies and the US military who produce most of of world's emissions and really the fault of the average Joe for not eating vegan and buying an electric car.</p>
<p>It's almost as if they don't really care about fixing the environment or ending the pandemic, they only care about how much money they can squeeze out in the short term.</p>

Who’s gonna argue as long as you virtue signal hard enough. Better yet you be the first one to ask the tsa dude why he doesn’t have three levels of protection on and request he finds three masks before getting near you.
Two can play the ridiculousness game, it’s so absurd at this point I’ve just stopped caring . </p>

        <p>For what it is worth, I got back from a one week round trip yesterday, and at the 4 airports I went to (layovers) did not have/see any of the problems OP described.</p>
<p>If anyone was at the terminal and needed to each lunch, they just went to a bench somewhere on the side away from people, took their masks off to eat, and no one bitched at them. Plenty of people weren't even eating, they were just in a corner bench watching a movie or something without a mask. </p>
<p>I bought some fried chicken, and watched a movie for an hour, surrounding by other people doing the same, just keeping distance with no mask, and I didn't see a single person get bitched at the entire time by any of the flight attendants walking by. </p>
<p>I thought they were pretty chill about it actually. I wear a gaiter too, masks are fucking dumb.</p>

<p>A question for these airlines is if they're so concerned, why are the planes booked full and not like how Southwest or Delta did/does? I'm sure they'd malfunction and step on their own toes trying to come up with an answer. Shit makes no sense and is hypocritical at best</p>

        <p>same shit happened to me. Flew through Miami to get to the virgin islands. On the return flight the FA gave us a whole lecture about “wear your mask as a courtesy to others” and “you won’t be flying anywhere ever if you refuse to comply.” Then a woman’s mask fell down while she was sleeping and the flight attendant woke her to tell her to put it back on. The lady said “oh I’m sorry I just have asthma so its hard to breathe with the mask when I’m sleeping.” The FA didnt care she just made a big show about telling the lady to put her mask back up. Then the FA goes to the back of the plane (where I’m seated) and bitches loudly to the second FA about how rude the lady is and she’s “so sick of dealing with people like that.” These people really feel so important enforcing their little BS rules and threatening people with the no fly list they’ve let it get to their heads. Its fucking annoying.</p>

        <p>This really depends on the flight crew and how many people are on the flight.</p>
<p>We caught an almost empty red-eye flight to orlando via Alaska and they were pretty chill. The way back they were a bit more vocal but still... nothing major.</p>
<p>I really don't think the airlines want to do this either. It is really a stupid policy. It is all legal and marketing wank.</p>

        <p>Thanks for that testimonial.  I'm getting ready to go to Tanzania.  I've been researching airlines and on the american airlines site it literally does say that you are expected to chew with the mask on.  I'm sure they are all bad, but you may have chosen the worst of the worst.  I did walk into the Columbus, GA regional airport without a mask and spoke to the Delta employees.  One woman actually had her mask down.  They told me that if I tried to get through a TSA checkpoint, they would enforce the mask mandate.  </p>
<p>There's part of me that wants to get kicked off all the airlines and sue them, but I know that there are children throughout the world who need me (and my resources) more.  america is a failed, disposable empire.  It's time to help people who are more deserving.</p>

        <p>You forget the first part of the first passage: “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God”</p>
<p>The wages of your sins are death too.</p>
<p>Do you also believe these passages too? Or are these parts of the Bible too hard to swallow?</p>
<p>“Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.”</p>
<p>“Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good.”</p>

        <p>He had a surgical mask to give you and you're still complaining? Watch this video https://youtu.be/DNeYfUTA11s and take note of the particles in the air and the distance it travels for each covering. It wasn't the science that changed, the policy changed and the guy working the counter was sick of people who don't realize they need to read up on travel policies before flying. It sounds more like you experienced a couple minor inconveniences, and even though they are for your safety as much as everyone else's, you just want to complain.</p>

        <p>Why would it change the outcome if someone already has coronavirus? The point is to reduce the spread of the virus by keeping carriers from leaving their particles everywhere. Socially distancing is required in tandem with masks because the masks reduce the distance that the breath/sneeze/cough/yawn travels and then the socially distancing keeps people from being within the radius of the floaty death molecules.</p>

        <p>&rt;Now the planes are 100% full which is somehow okay, but they’ll bitch if your mask is down for a second.... makes sense lol.</p>
<p>Like your airline rep said, the science has changed. Masks work is the obvious conclusion here. But you don't use logic so well I guess. </p>
<p>Also, of course the attendants are going to be anal about this. To you its "im just one person, I'm not sick, whats the problem?" But they get several people like that every flight. If they care about self preservation (as we all do) they are right to make people wear their shit right.</p>

<p>... and shame on you for wanting to impose a mask on everyone. It is absolutely disgusting and criminal. Have you seen children traumatized into wearing masks everywhere, absolutely terrified of approaching another human being, never seeing another human face, parents threatening to take their mask away if they don’t behave, teaching them they will die if they approach others, to fear breathing fresh air and their own bodies, that they are spreading death by their very existence.

<p>Am I shaming you...? You should be ashamed, you should be cowering in your basement with shame, the psychological trauma you are imposing on children is criminal and deeply revolting. You are teaching them to be scared of other human beings, that their own bodies are to be feared. Are you conscious that there are babies out there who likely have never seen another human face other than their parents or on a screen. The amount of developmental, social and mental health issues this will cause will be unprecedented and you should be disgusted and disturbed by your willing involvement in this charade.</p>

<p>Is a hair net your go to example because it is most applicable to your line of work? You signed that contract, not me. No one is obligating me under threat of violence to wear a hair net 24/7, not outside, not in a park, not on the beach, if someone did try to force me to wear a hairnet, yes I would take issue with that. </p>
<p>Basic human rights include the right of movement and assembly, among others. Both of which are being seriously curtailed. You can just admit it: you are not following science, you are following feeling and emotions. You are advocating for totalitarianism because you happen to agree with the position being imposed, it’s going to come around to bite you. Remember me when you have a boot on your neck and how I warned you of the consequences of dismantling our civil rights so easily and carelessly. </p>

        <p>I don’t have difficultly getting enough oxygen, but I am not able to taste the fresh sea air which is better for my health than breathing through a mask. In any case the new guideline is 2 masks, are you wearing 2 masks? Do you change your mask every 3 hours without touching in in between? </p>
<p>I most certainly know what the difference is and neither pre nor asymptomatic transmission is a major driver of infection. I have another wall of text on hand if you are interested. </p>
<p>My hospital has had maybe 20 covid deaths and all were either suffering from chronic disease or well over life expectancy. Yet we have locked down and absolutely destroyed our economy. The largest employer is laying off as many as they can without the government stopping them and masks are mandatory in the entire country except on private property, even at the beach.....</p>

<p>Here's CDCs most recent findings (two days ago) about the prevalence of presymptomatic and asymptomatic spread. </p>
<p>As for your last point. I dont believe in lockdowns for this disease, either. If we didn't have idiots like you in our society, we could slow the spread without lockdowns. How do you think Japan and Korea handled this so much better than us without lockdowns? </p>

        <p>Why don’t you wear three masks? In fact, why don’t you wear hazmat suit? You can get one on Amazon for a reasonable price, is there honestly any reason you don’t wear a hazmat suit ? </p>
<p>That study makes a lot of assumptions and basically is just a statistical model without taking into consideration a plethora of real world factors or observations. This is the problem with putting unaccountable experts™️ in charge of our lives, we end up with whoever makes the most sensational claims being given free reign to test their hypnosis on the population. </p>
<p>S Korea is paranoid/terrified that they are going to get invaded by N Korea/China, they wouldn’t publish any numbers that called into question their national security. Even more so for countries like Taiwan or India. India and China could both have 10 million dead each and you can be sure they wouldn’t broadcast it. They’d probably be capable of clearing the sick off into the basement so they could take propaganda videos of “empty” hospitals to show everyone how good they are doing. Forgive me if I’m a bit skeptical of their numbers. </p>
<p>I’m assuming you’re from the US, and I’m going to take a stab in the dark here and point out that Korea and Japan don’t have 2 out of 3 people obese or overweight. The epidemic of preventable chronic due to the poor lifestyle choices of Americans is responsible for far more deaths than Covid 19. </p>
<p>In fact Il go so far as to say that lockdowns are racist and a form of white supremacy. Gasp.... Basically we have the populations of countries like the US and Western Europe which are privileged enough to be able to lockdown doing so at the expense of poor countries which are economically unable to lockdown and are being condemned to destitution and extreme poverty, with all the poverty related deaths that will result. Not to mention that a prevailing reason for which so many Americans are dying is because they are in “at risk” categories due to decades of THEIR OWN poor lifestyle choices which have resulted in preventable chronic disease.</p>
<p>Well where I live they have taken measures so draconian that Fauci could only dream of it. They have essentially done everything “right” with absolutely nothing to show for it compared to other countries which have done far less or even some absolutely nothing at all. Yet I am still required to wear a mask, alone, at the beach instead of taking advantage of the fresh sea air....</p>

        <p>You are so out of touch with the world and it shows. You obviously have no idea what life is like in South Korea right now and during this pandemic. You continue to boil every complex issue into its simplest form. Hurr it must be because they afraid of N Koreans.</p>
<p>You need to learn how to use logic.

        <p>Well if you’d rather believe that China only had 4K deaths or that Taiwan only had a total of 9, don’t let me dissuade you, by all means let us solicit our dear leaders to weld people into their own apartments to keep us safe. That’s very solid data and and excellent precedent to follow. </p>
<p>Oh I’m very “in touch” with the world, almost certainly more so than you are. Granted, I most likely don’t consume as much anime as you surely do so perhaps I’m not as much of an authority on East Asia as you doubtlessly are but I very much in tune to world happenings. </p>
<p>...and yet I would rather make the comparison to Belgium, France, the UK or other Western nations which far more closely resemble the US (which I suppose is where we are talking about). I’m in a small Western European country which had a very strict and early lockdown, which made masks mandatory very quickly in all public areas, has an efficient and very well staffed contact tracing unit, has essentially closed the borders to tourists, has had probably the most efficient testing of practically the entire population, requires tests for anyone staying more than 24 hours and taken all the “right” steps to no avail. ..... I cannot help but notice other jurisdictions who have done far less or literally nothing and are doing just as well if not better. </p>
<p>Let’s be a little realistic, most countries do not have the financial, logistical or scientific ability to test at scale nor the technological infrastructure and public accountability to accurately compile, record and report results in a timely fashion without corruption. Those that do, may not be particularly inclined to share that data and some countries are clearly publishing complete fabrications in order to make themselves look good or to quell civil unrest/war and panic or to avoid appearing weak to their neighbors and rivals. So excuse me for my skepticism but there are very few countries which I would trust to publish credible data.</p>

<li>An open letter from <a href="https://docs4opendebate.be/en/open-letter/">September 2020</a> signed by 418 medical doctors states:</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;...Masks belong in contexts where contacts with proven at-risk groups or people with upper respiratory complaints take place, and in a medical context/hospital-retirement home setting. They reduce the risk of droplet infection by sneezing or coughing. Oral masks in healthy individuals are ineffective against the spread of viral infections. Wearing a mask is not without side effects. Oxygen deficiency (headache, nausea, fatigue, loss of concentration) occurs fairly quickly, an effect similar to altitude sickness. Every day we now see patients complaining of headaches, sinus problems, respiratory problems and hyperventilation due to wearing masks. In addition, the accumulated CO2 leads to a toxic acidification of the organism which affects our immunity. Some experts even warn of an increased transmission of the virus in case of inappropriate use of the mask. Our Labour Code (Codex 6) refers to a CO2 content (ventilation in workplaces) of 900 ppm, maximum 1200 ppm in special circumstances. After wearing a mask for one minute, this toxic limit is considerably exceeded to values that are three to four times higher than these maximum values. Anyone who wears a mask is therefore in an extreme poorly ventilated room. Inappropriate use of masks without a comprehensive medical cardio-pulmonary test file is therefore not recommended by recognised safety specialists for workers. Hospitals have a sterile environment in their operating rooms where staff wear masks and there is precise regulation of humidity / temperature with appropriately monitored oxygen flow to compensate for this, thus meeting strict safety standards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost 100% of known transmissions of corona happen from extended interaction (home, work, public transit) - you are very unlikely to get it from a stranger passing you by the sidewalk or by a grocery aisle - see <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1">here</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com./2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html">here</a>.</li>

<li>
<p>Here are a few more "oodles" for you to muse over if you are interested in educating yourself rather than sitting around making a fool of yourself and contemplating your ignorance:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gold standard of evidence in biomedical research is the randomized controlled trial. A <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">systematic review</a> of cloth mask research published in 2020 in the academic journal <em>Emerging Infectious Diseases</em> of the <em>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</em> concluded that:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did <em>not</em> support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p>
<ul>
<li>The foregoing finding has been reinforced by a Bayesian analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials. <a href="https://www.qeios.com/read/1SC5L4">Perski et al., 2020</a>, concluded:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Available evidence from RCTs is <em>equivocal</em> as to whether or not wearing face masks in community settings results in a reduction in clinically- or laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections.</p>
<ul>
<li>A systematic review by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1">Brainard et al., 2020</a>, concluded:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>A systematic review and meta-analysis by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2">Jefferson et al., 2020</a>, noted:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;We included 15 randomised trials investigating the effect of masks (14 trials) in healthcare workers and the general population and of quarantine (1 trial). We found no trials testing eye protection. Compared to no masks there was no reduction of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases (Risk Ratio 0.93, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.05) or influenza (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.61-1.17) for masks in the general population, nor in healthcare workers (Risk Ratio 0.37, 95%CI 0.05 to 2.50).</p>
<ul>
<li>A most recent systematic review of 18 randomized controlled trials and of 11 other systematic reviews by <a href="https://www.cfp.ca/content/66/7/509.abstract">Dugré et al., 2020</a>, concluded:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;This systematic review found limited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections.</p>
<ul>
<li>A systematic review and meta-analysis of potential health risks of face masks by <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.20133207v1">Bakhit et al., 2020</a>, concluded that:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;There are <em>insufficient data to quantify all of the adverse effects</em> that might reduce the acceptability, adherence, and effectiveness of face masks. New research on facemasks should assess and <em>report the harms and downsides</em>. Urgent research is also needed on methods and designs to mitigate the downsides of facemask wearing, particularly the assessment of alternatives such as face shields.</p>
<ul>
<li>A peer-reviewed paper from August 2020 by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2020.1797997">Martin et al., 2020</a> assessing the overall wisdom of recommending masks for the general public, noted:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;There is very limited evidence that cloth face coverings reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19...Few studies examine the use of face coverings in community settings: when taken in aggregate, those that do find no statistically significant evidence of reduced transmission compared with no face coverings...Rather than communicate a falsely unequivocal message about the value of face coverings, researchers should articulate scientific disagreement, the nature of scientific uncertainty, and its implications for how we act to improve knowledge and action.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-on-covid-19-and-masks">World Health Organization</a> admits to this day that:</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Non-medical, fabric masks are being used by many people in public areas, but there has been limited evidence on their effectiveness...</p>
<ul>
<li>A September 2020 empirical study (preprint) by <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">(van den Broek-Altenburg et al., 2020)</a> highlighted the foolishness of rushing to recommend or mandate masks for the general public.

        <p>Two things as I start to read this wall of text. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I notice you going on about cloth masks, which we were never discussing here. We are talking about surgical. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first study you posted about COVID is talking about protecting the user, which is still a debated stance. However, a mask protecting those AROUND the user has been proven time and time again. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So thats two strawman attempts so far. Good job. </p>
<p>Let me know if you want me to post studies.</p>

<p>The US is a big place and 500K isn't that much. Even still, I have a deep amount of empathy for people who have suffered the loss of a loved one during this charade. I can't imagine the indignity of coming to the end of your life and being denied the comfort of your loved ones while you're on your deathbed.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately when dumb fucks can’t be smart enough to follow guidelines for the sake of other people’s safety, there has to be more strict rules about it. Dude I don’t really understand your stance at all. Yes. I understand you don’t give a fuck about anybody else but yourself. If your spouse/mother/father/kids got covid and died you’d think differently.</p>

        <p>You sure commenting a lot for somebody who said “peace I’m out”, but it’s okay I understand. Anyone can enjoy a good scream into the void. </p>
<p>I’ll play the game of eliciting emotional responses with you. How about it’s a known fact that rising unemployment causes suicides? I hope you feel great knowing that the lockdown approach to the pandemic causes people to kill themselves when they lose their job, their will to wake up, their social contacts, and sense of community. I think if you knew your spouse/mother/father/kids killed themselves because of the lockdowns you’d think differently. </p>
<p>Or maybe not, because you’re so devoted to saving their lives - as evidenced by your comments - that they’d be a worthy sacrifice for your great societal efforts.</p>

        <p>Yeah, that’s a horrible statistic. But you know what? 50k people die of suicide every year in the US. 10x that have died in less than a year of covid. If dumb fucks took this seriously from the start and trusted scientists and wore masks we would’ve been passed this 9 months ago. Less covid deaths, less economic turmoil, less unemployment.... but no! I don’t want to succumb to the dictators telling me to care about other ppl!</p>

        <p>Maybe if someone you know killed themselves due to these tyrannical restrictions. Or maybe if you lost your home and couldn’t provide for your family. or maybe if you had lost your small business along with your life savings, hopes and dreams, maybe you would think a little differently. The “guidelines” are not helping, they are cruel and arbitrary and shame on you for cheerleading on this totalitarian dismantlement of our civil rights.</p>

        <p>I can fly on whatever airline I want, company pays for it anyway and they don’t care about the cost within reason. It’s flight availability that makes me fly American over Delta. Delta just doesn’t have as many flights where I’m at. The airport I’m out of has AA flights almost every hour to several major hubs and then many direct flights as well. Whereas delta only has a handful of flights a day and nearly all involve connections. After this, I might be willing to try to be more flexible with my schedule and try Delta.</p>
<p>I never even would have thought someone would consider flying American as “poor” lmao.</p>

        <p>I personally keep seeing the argument that people know masks don't work but that's why we social distance along with it and blah blah. So it's a consensus that they don't work and even more so in a plane packed full.</p>
<p>Even Fauci is talking about how single masks don't work (as he initially said in the past) and double should do the trick.</p>
<p>In any case, freaking out over people not wearing masks on planes where they pack people in like sardines is stupid. The virus isn't magically being stopped or slowed down and even more so when you MUST wear it when chewing 🙄</p>

        <p>As we boarded our flight the stewardesses were freaking out- social distance as we check you in! No need to cram around the gate! Stand back! Make space between yourselves!Oh lol, ok! But im going to be sitting in everyone’s personal space once I get on the flight.</p>
<p>pand zero social distancing in the America Lounge where every seat was full maskless while we are waiting fir our flight.</p>
