    <strong>To the doomers‚Äô fallacious claim that the unvaccinated are prolonging the pandemic and delaying herd immunity:</strong>
    <p><p>Simple logic dictates that the exact opposite is true.  </p>
<p>So we agree that a person not getting vaccinated and not wearing the mask is spreading more covid cases than a vaccinated person, yes?  So therefore they are ending this sooner as more people are contracting covid, so more are developing immunity and we reach herd immunity faster.  </p>
<p>This shouldn‚Äôt need to be spelled out; but the propaganda is so repetitive and strong that I even find myself forgetting this:</p>
<p>Every new ‚Äúcase‚Äù of covid is in effect the exact same thing as having another vaccinated person.  That‚Äôs another person that has been exposed to covid; and therefore had an immune system response and now become immune.<br>
(And I‚Äôm not even counting the fact that natural immunity is far more effective than the vaccine, and is permanent; so no need for ‚Äúbooster shots‚Äù, either.). (And no, before you say vaccines are more effective than natural immunity, let me remind you that that is a logical impossibility because vaccines only work INSOFAR as they are able to TRIGGER your immune system to make the EXACT SAME RESPONSE that it would have if it were exposed to the real virus.  This is how vaccines have always worked.  They are not a magic cure.  They use your own body‚Äôs immune system response.  That‚Äôs it.)</p>
<p>The point is: You either get immune through the vaccine or through natural exposure.  Cases and vaccinated people achieve the exact same result.  </p>
<p>So there is absolutely ZERO grounding to the claim that unvaccinated people are causing herd immunity to take longer.  The exact OPPOSITE is true because they are spreading covid faster.  </p>
<p>The ONLY possible argument in favour of vaccines is if you are personally at great risk from covid the virus itself; and want the vaccine to protect yourself.  That‚Äôs it.  End of story. </p>
<p>This whole idea that me not getting vaccinated somehow prolongs the amount of time covid exists is an absolute bullshit logical impossibility that needs to stop being repeated.</p></p>

        <p>Key difference between vax immunity and natural immunity.</p>
<p>Vax immunity for all these shots targets the exact same spike protein.</p>
<p>Natural immunity recognizes and targets multiple parts of the SARS cov2 virus.</p>
<p>If the spike protein mutates (single strand RNA viruses mutate quickly which is why we don't have vaccines for the common cold) then vaccine immunity is gone.  The natural immunity for most people will still be triggered by another protein from the virus.</p>

        <p>I thought they changed the definition of herd immunity. Everyone knows you can't build immunity to a virus unless you take an experimental drug that doesn't prevent you from getting the virus. /S</p>

        <p>If you want to look at this purely through logic and science, its the mitigation measures that are prolonging the pandemic. That was the literal point of "flatten the curve", to slow and extend the spread over a longer period of time.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  The only thing prolonging this is lockdown measures and compliance with lockdown measures.  This never otherwise would have last past any other typical flu season.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the level of immunity (as determined by the level of antibodies) varies greatly between people who've been previously infected. </p>
<p>"Higher levels of neutralizing antibodies provide better protection against new infection,". </p>
<p>"More severe symptoms of infection often lead to higher levels of neutralizing antibodies, while less severe symptoms may lead to lower or no measurable neutralizing antibody production."</p>
<p>In other words, if you had a very mild COVID-19 infection, your immune system may not have formed enough antibodies. And the same can be true for those who experienced a more severe form of the disease. A study published in Frontiers in Immunology in May 2020 found that the COVID-19 infection was so overpowering in hospitalized patients that their immune response became exhausted, and immune memory to the virus wasn't adequately formed.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid not.</p>
<p>The vaccine delivers the correct amount of exactly the right stuff to provoke the best immune reaction. A lot of people who got covid would not have had the immune reaction needed to stay immune. That's the benefit of the vaccine.</p>
<p>That's also why the vaccine can sometimes, and incredibly rarely, produce side effects, because the immune reaction is that strong. It's evidence that it's doing the job it's intended to do.</p>

        <p>The vaccine provides a longer lasting immunity than getting Covid. Most people who got covid either got it very lightly or very heavily. Either one doesn't cause the long lasting immunity, for the reasons explained in my original post.</p>
<p>The vaccine will give you immunity for longer, increasing your protection and the protection of your community. It will also protect against variants, which you may not be protected against if you had Covid previously, again, because you may not have built up a good enough immunity.</p>
<p>The vaccine isn't likely to be permanent. Some trials and research is under way. So let's assume its not. All that's required is 6 monthly, 12 monthly or 24 monthly jabs. It's a 2 minute procedure, it's free, so there really isn't any problem.</p>
<p>And the best thing, once everyone's vaccinated, we will be able to return to normal. You may not agree with why we're in lockdown or why there's restrictions. But one thing every politician has said is, once enough people are vaccinated, we go back to normal.</p>
<p>And let's compare the vaccine to Covid. The vaccine risk of side effects is lower than the risk of getting seriously ill with Covid.
Any side effects last 1 to 2 days. Covid can last 2 to 3 weeks, and potentially give you long Covid.</p>
<p>It's a really easy choice.</p>

        <p>His main point is about herd immunity. You are basically saying that if you have a mild case or notice nothing you are not immune ? As thus your point is irrelevant. You could also theorize that if you notice nothing your immune system is so strong it s not even allowing any virus inside.</p>

        <p>Herd Immunity is a theory based on 'modeling'.   I would like to see any actual studies that prove the theory.</p>
<p>I think there are way too many variables in disease transmission, especially among viruses, to assume it works exactly like the models predict.</p>

        <p>Whoa.  Dude.  Think about what you‚Äôre implicating for a second.  Herd immunity is NO theory.  </p>
<p>The idea that communities of people can become immune to viruses through exposure; is ancient basic knowledge predating even the time of the Bible.  </p>
<p>The theoretical models you are speaking about are merely statistical estimations on what exact percentage of a given community needs to become immune in order for a virus to stop spreading (it‚Äôs a debate of whether it stops spreading once, say, 70% are immune, or perhaps at 75%).  </p>
<p>But to claim that herd immunity is a theory is equivalent to claiming that immunity itself is a theory.  That‚Äôs crazy man.</p>

        <p>Then please show me the evidence of studies proving the theory.</p>
<p>That's how science works.   It is based on theories that are then proven through experiment.</p>
<p>Predating the Bible... good one.    Herd Immunity was first theorized in 1923.</p>
