<title>I literally told someone that a spike protein is in the vaccine when they said it wasn't. The CDC confirms this. There is no hope for these confirmation biased people, can't even tell them something if it's true.</title>

        <p>That's what these death shots are primarily made up of! That, and other horrors! Yet God forbid these fools educate themselves before getting jabbed with something that will quite possibly harm them for LIFE (however long that is)!</p>
<p>The problem with the "covid vaccinated" forum is there is no hope for these people. They've already damaged themselves PERMANENTLY with these vaccines. And for anyone who doesn't believe me, look at the shit they post! They whine non-stop about the horrific side-effects they are now experiencing from them. When the truth is, anyone with a BRAIN wouldn't have taken them to begin with!! I feel sorry for them on one level, but on the other, they have THEMSELVES to blame!!</p>

        <p>And guess what? I just tried to make ONE post there myself, one someone expressed being "anxious" about taking the death shots and I was INSTANTLY BANNED too! All I said was this: </p>
<p>You SHOULD BE anxious. Read all the side effects on this forum-- just for a start! But if that STILL doesn't deter you from getting one, please see this: <a href="https://aim4truth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Front-Line-Workers-Testimony-on-Vaccinations.pdf">https://aim4truth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Front-Line-Workers-Testimony-on-Vaccinations.pdf</a></p>
