        <p>Correct.  It shows the disinterest in any data that doesn't abet the narrative and agenda.  It is sobering how unwilling people are- who are otherwise seemingly intelligent and thoughtful.</p>
<p>I suppose it's tough to think clearly when there is no reliable source of information out there- only a deluge of propaganda.</p>

        <p>The deliberate attempts to hide, misrepresent and outright lie about the data is nothing less than organized criminal collusion in flagrant human rights abuses and murders that have already reached war crime levels of atrocities. They have violated international laws, national laws, state laws, constitutional amendments, medical standards, and basic ethical principles to force this untested gene therapy. They will face tribunals for this before the end.</p>

<p>Assuming there's anyone who's interested in justice left to conduct them.  The anti-sovereignty facet of this could very well leave no parties intact with the ability and desire to pursue anything.</p>
<p>The Nuremburg trials would never have happened without surviving sovereigns relying on reliable and factual data to empanel a tribunal to hold the war criminals accountable.</p>
<p>I see one big casualty of this pandemic game being played being sovereign governments with global standing willing to stand up to the bullies and their bullshit.</p>

        <p>The side effects and bad reactions are the tip of the iceberg if the detracting doctors are correct.
Once the next Different variety of a Corona Virus comes through... not the next Covid variant, but the next truly different Corona Virus, which apparently go around in 2-3 year cycles, the death rate will be phenomenal.</p>
<p>People that become exposed will have their own immune systems go into hyperdrive, and will attack their own bodies.</p>
<p>Human gonads also have spike proteins, so a good portion of the vaccinated will also be sterilized.</p>

        <p>One doesn't kneel to what one does oneself, one kneels to what others do. The police who knelt to burners, the Trumpers who knelt to the violation of constitutional rights because muh private platform, the right wing who knelt to red flag laws and arrested patriots, the "conspiracy theorists" who knelt to the steal and the lockdown, the "good citizens" who knelt to a never-ending two weeks to flatten the curve...</p>
<p>We knew all of this was wrong...</p>
<p>Nothing was done.</p>
<p>This is the price we pay for sacrificing freedom for security.</p>
<p>And the violent left who who neither reasons nor negotiates, who burns while we worry about optics... They're more vaxxed then us, and they're going to figure out what was done to them very soon.</p>
<p>They had more guts than our pathetic cuckservatives...</p>
<p>Misdirected though they were, they were willing to take actual action for their beliefs rather than just talk and talk and talk...</p>
<p>And they, at least, will neither forgive nor forget those who destroyed their lost friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>Let them burn it all.</p>
<p>Fuck the bottom line.</p>

        <p>Well if we are to look at COVID-19 for what it is - a <em>coronavirus</em> - then we can slowly come to the conclusion that we've dealt with coronaviruses before. We had SARS-CoV for example, from 2003, which had a mortality of 10%, higher than COVID-19, but had a lower rate of infection. Similarly, we also had MERS-CoV from 2012. It's easy then to see COVID-19 as nothing <em>that</em> much different from SARS and MERS, with the only difference being that it spreads far easier. </p>
<p>That is thought to be due to the virus accumulating in the nose and throat before any symptoms actually show, as opposed to SARS which only really started to become heavily infectious in the late stages as said in <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-vs-sars#sars">this article</a>. It's important however to keep in mind that viruses have a chance of mutating each time they multiply, similar to most other organisms too, which is why there's so many strains of COVID-19 now.</p>
<p>As such, there's vaccine studies such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3371787/#__ffn_sectitle">this one</a> that date all the way back to 16 years ago, and there even had trials pushed into Phase 1. Moreover, there's also <a href="https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-020-00695-2">this article</a> that goes on to explain in depth what we've learnt when it comes to creating vaccines against coronaviruses, as backed by previous research done on SARS and MERS. </p>
<p>Lastly, if you're not convinced yet, it's also very worth mentioning the fact that we've been studying and using vaccines for hundreds of years, and <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/93064">according to professionals</a>, side effects tend to typically occur within the first 2 months and it's unknown of a vaccine causing side effects years later. And sure, it's fair that mRna vaccines are new, but the benefits, as backed by the data from clinical trials, outweigh the risks by a great margin.</p>
<p>P.S: not trying to convince any of you to get vaccinated, just letting you know that there's far more behind the COVID-19 vaccine than it first seems.</p>

<p>For each one of you who don't get vaccinated but still get the virus from others and transmit it further (especially since you don't tend to think wearing masks is necessary) there's someone out there with a compromised immune system who's gonna risk losing their life from being transmitted the virus.</p>

        <p>I would love to see some sources behind these numbers that you seemingly pulled out of your backside whilst conveniently ignoring the fact that logically, the risks outweigh the benefits if you're nice enough to care about those of us who have weakened immune systems. Which is also perfectly fine if you don't care. Just admit it is all, you don't have to bring these made up 4000% figures. Also, when I say "sources" I don't mean some 40 year old wine mom's blog or meme, just to clarify that.</p>

        <p>I didn't pull them out of my backside. You just assume that because you'll jump through any mental hoops you need to in order to make this make sense. The vaccine adverse reaction data is right there. Go look yourself. That's not my job. Out of 1 million teens vaccinated, 40 will get heart inflammation. 8000 cases of covid will be avoided and one death will be prevented. Don't blame me for you not knowing the data, oh wait. You being too lazy to look at the data is what got you into this mess and poisoned. I honestly and truly feel sorry for you. Have a nice night.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm admitting that the vaccines don't work fully on people who are born with dysfunctional immune systems, wow, who would've thought. The goal isn't to completely get rid of the virus within a year, the key to is prevent as many deaths as possible you selfish asshole, speaking as if those of us who are at higher risk of death due to secondary factors are less relevant than those of us who aren't born with immunity issues.

        <p>Love how you conveniently excluded people with disorders they developed with no control over. But also, I never said people should be forced to get vaccinated. I just believe there's a lot of misinformation and biased thinking on this sub when it comes to vaccines.</p>
<p>This guy that I was arguing with earlier for example, he's sceptical about studies done by respectable doctors in the field carrying peer reviewed journals, and yet, he believes in this 1 study done by 1 single doctor from a Spanish university, even though the doctor himself admits that his methods of research are unreliable. And not to mention that the Graphene experiment wasn't even reproduced, which is one of the most basic factors that come into play when carrying an experiment. And yet, he believes that.</p>
<p>If you guys wanna go all in on scepticism, then good for you, . What gets to me though is when I see people being selectively sceptical. At that point, it stops being scepticism, and it becomes confirmation bias seeking.</p>

        <p>Less deaths or cases in vaccinated allegedly due to vaccines. </p>
<p>People who get vaccinated are also people who generally take other precautions like masking distancing and being basement dwelling SJWs (I am for social justice, just not the lazy self serving kind that exists today. REAL warriors of social justice are fine by me) </p>
<p>The data set is incomplete. We need to compare a before and after to avoid this fallacy. We need to see how the two groups changed. Then compare the change in cases/infections. </p>
<p>Vaccinated are still getting almost half of the cases tho. Makes me wish I could unvaccinated myself since I was right all along. But I did it for my pregnant sister. Her peace of mind was a bigger concern to me than whatever the vaccine could do to me. </p>
<p>I’m about as scared of vaccine as I am of covid… not scared.</p>

        <p>Hmm I see what you mean, but if we look at it logically, vaccines aren't 100% effective and as of now for example, 87% of England's population is vaccinated. As such, there's ofc gonna be a lot of deaths from vaccinated people as well.</p>
<p>But let's say that today there's 100 deaths from COVID, 50 are vaccinated people and 50 are non-vaccinated people. At first sight, it might look like whether you get vaccinated or not, there's a 50% chance of still dying. But if we consider that those 50 vaccinated people are out of 87% of the population, and that those 50 non-vaccinated people are out of 13% of the population, we can see the vaccines working. </p>
<p>Moreover, almost all elderly people have been vaccinated, and ofc that the vaccine will not work quite as well on them as on the younger populations which are less likely to get vaccinated and also less likely to die of COVID. So the high mortality rate amongst vaccinated people can also be attributed due to elderly vaccinated people.</p>
<p>As such, I think that logically, the vaccines are working quite well, not the best, but as good as it gets considering how early they came out. But before and after data would be nice, although it would be harder to obtain.</p>

        <p>All it said was vaccines had a SLIGHLTY lower death rate from virus without accounting for other behaviors that can increase/decreases risk of exposure and/or dying. </p>

        <p>Not saying it to discredit your argument, I think you raise a good point, but how do you know that the vaccines only have a <em>slightly</em> lower death rate as compared to the virus without taking behaviours into consideration? It would be a very interesting conclusion to come down to, but some data to back this up would be great.</p>

        <p>News flash, fully vaccinated people are still getting covid and dieing from it. That means, they're spreading it too. If you look at the data, even more fully jabbed people are dying from covid now than unjabbed. And no. I don't have to give you the source. Just accept defeat.

I’m not fighting for or against masks, I’m talking about workplace regulations, transit regulations.  The real world.

<p>Keep trying to push people to your side.  I’m in the middle taking an objective view.  You can continue to spout things off as fact, which aren’t.  No one knows the real outcomes.

If you wanna make society a little nicer, you could word it more like "I'm sorry I assumed you rushed it, but I'm glad to hear you took a calculated decision though!'. There's no reason to lie about it, your 2 comments from above are public for everybody to see and conclude that you did assume he rushed into getting vaccinated. Which is perfectly fine, as long as you own up to it and apologise :D</p>

        <p>Hanlon’s Razor- never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.</p>
<p>It’s not on purpose. It’s just what happens when we let reductionist models from academia guide our real world actions. </p>
<p>There will be vaccine escape variants. The vaccines Reduce symptoms. This will allow deadlier variants to spread because the vaccine does not stop spread. The idea is that a variant could come out that has been potentiated through interaction with vaccinated hosts and will have a higher death rate for the unvaccinated. Merck’s Disease in chickens, for example. </p>

After you do that, just look at the interests of all the groups. Follow the interests of the groups. No conspiracy needed.

        <p>Also, by definition, you can’t give informed consent without long term safety data. Not one of the billions of people vaccinated have given informed consent. I’d venture that a large majority don’t even understand what informed consent even is. Saying that, it’s even worse to think you’re giving informed consent when you’re not.

        <p>If their consent was truly INFORMED, all these vaccinated people would clearly understand that they are patients in a Phase B clinical trial of an experimental drug, and that trial will not be over until Dec 2022. (Jan '23 for one if them).
It will then take several months to analyze the data. </p>

        <p>You have two scenarios here : let the virus run amok and kills hundred of thousands more, more likely millions.</p>
<p>Or let people vaccines using new technology vaccine that are basically sugar, water and ARN strands. The ARN strands will disappear in your body within less than 48 hours, same as water and sugar. 
The only thing you are left with is the spike protein that your cell made. Since they are no viruses behind the protein, they will just get attacked by your own immune system and disappear as well. </p>

<p>No respiratory illness has ever collapsed our medical infrastructure in the past 100 years.</p>
<p>Thousands of "90 year olds" falling ill at the same time means the hospital won't have the capacity to save you when something happens to <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>COVID hasn't done that, so what is your point? Hospitals are overwhelmed <em>every single</em> Winter season. They regularly are overwhelmed, they are designed to operate at and above maximum capacity.</p>
<p>If you're so concerned about hospitals being overwhelmed, how about you build more hospitals instead of locking people in their homes? Oh wait, they did that, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/07/851712311/u-s-field-hospitals-stand-down-most-without-treating-any-covid-19-patients">the majority of them never saw a single patient</a> because it was completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>&rt;Thousands of "90 year olds" falling ill at the same time means the hospital won't have the capacity to save you when something happens to you.</p>
<p>Hospitals already don't have the capacity to save me because the government has shit them down to <em>prevent</em> being overwhelmed. You're causing the <em>exact same issue</em> with a different method while simultaneously trying to fix said issue.</p>
<p>&rt;Plus, everyone talks shit until their own mom or brother dies from COVID, because it's an unpredictable virus, not a 90 year old killing nanobot.</p>
<p>People die, that is life. Having a 0.15% chance of dying isn't enough of a deterrent to not spend quality time with your mum or brother. What is the point of saving the lives of your family if you aren't going to spend time with them anyway?</p>

<p>Because none of that is pandemic related, that's a real shitty argument. There is some death that are avoidable, and the vaccine and the confinement is doing just that.</p>
<p>Btw, I know this sub have a hard on for 99.99 or 99.98, but the real survival rate is about 98%. When you factor in the entire world, that's a lot of dead people.</p>

<p>Bro, are you serious? The vast majority of deaths in the world are <em>easily</em> preventable if you are willing to take as extreme actions as you are for COVID.</p>
<p>The difference is that you are manipulated with hysteria over COVID deaths, but not for any of the other causes of death.</p>

        <p>Truth be told, I've looked into it and although the study seems to be legit at first sight, it falls short in several areas. First of all, the study only used 1 vaccine and as stated within the report, the "origin and traceability [is] unknown". Not only does that make it an extremely small study, but the researchers themselves don't even know the origin of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Second of all, the research was done by comparing pictures of the vaccines to other pictures Graphene on a microscopical level, which as stated within the report itself, it's not a reliable way to reach such a bold conclusion. Lastly, the study has not been peer reviewed by anyone, and is not backed by the university in itself. In other words, somebody got only 1 vial, supposedly of the vaccine, from an unknown source, and tested it for Graphene. Despite being standard for scientific procedures to check whether or not an experiment is reproducible, they did not go on to test another sample, which makes it even more untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Personally I'm gonna keep a lookout for updates on the matter, as there are <a href="https://rattibha.com/thread/1411044196161630208?lang=en">other doctors</a> pointing out the urgency to recreate the results. As of now, surely we can agree that if we are to be skeptical, we should be just as weary of trusting low level "professionals" as high level professionals, especially when they're putting out such bold statements while conveniently leaving out very important basics in science, such as reproducing the same experiment in order to prove its conclusiveness. At the end of the day, we were taught these basics of reproducing experiments during small  examination all the way back in secondary school, a doctor missing out on something so simple yet so important should not be trusted blindly, especially with a testing sample of just 1. You can't be selectively skeptical based on what you want to hear and what you don't want to hear.</p>

        <p>See, this is what I dislike the most about this community. You guys pick and choose what you're skeptical about, rendering peer reviewed journals by actual professionals as "lies", yet calling these 1 person with 1 sample studies "the hidden truth". You can't tell me to question everything, yet trust small small studies blindly. </p>
<p>How does that make you any different than the so called "sheeple" who get the vaccine? You're the same, except you put no intellectual energy into actually choosing what you believe in, and what you question. Which is exactly what the average person does too, except they do it with opposing beliefs to yours. I'm sure you can use some logic to see that your way of approaching things like this contradicts itself. But you choose to ignore it because you would rather act blind, than admit you're wrong.</p>

<p>AND do not attempt to take our right to go to the grocery store away like they're about to do in France. You'll have much more deadly things to worry about than covid if you do, oh wait, YOU don't make the decisions, you just blindly follow them. Clak. Clak. It's coming.</p>

        <p>Mate what are you rambling on about, I didn't even try to convince you to get vaccinated or whatever you're talking about there. I'm just telling you that your logic is inconsistent. You consider yourself to be skeptical, yet you pick and choose what you question and what you trust based on your current belief.</p>
<p>That doesn't make you a skeptic, it makes you a confirmation bias seeker. Which is perfectly fine, don't get me wrong. But at least admit that you aren't any better than the people who get vaccinated by looking for confirmation bias. You're exactly the same, except you <em>don't</em> get vaccinated by looking for things to feed into your confirmation bias. No difference in the mindset.</p>

<p>"The Global Research website was established on the 9th of September 2001, two days before the tragic events of September 11. Barely a few days later, Global Research had become a major news source on the New World Order and Washington’s “war on terrorism”."</p>
<p>Here you already have a huge bias on the editorial choice. </p>
<p>The report could be interesting, but it should be posted on Nature, or other peer reviewed journals. 
However I am not sure it's up to their standard.  </p>
<p>Read the conclusion : "Microscopic study of the sample provides strong evidence for the probable presence ofgraphene derivatives, although microscopy does not provide conclusive evidence"</p>
<p>Not conclusive, and done on ONE Sample.</p>

        <p>When you have hundreds of billions of dollars to throw around, you can credit, or discredit anything you want. Finding information IS an issue in the age of censorship. If you haven't noticed the fact checker bubbles and google... They own stock in the vaccine companies. But really, we make our claims with our bodies. You most likely got the vaccine and are in the experiment, waiting to see if you don't die by 2023. I'm in the control group, waiting to see if covid kills me.. with a 99.x% survival rate, I'd say my chances are looking pretty good that I'll make it to 2023. Will YOU? Only time will tell. To claim anything else would be misinformation. But there are many scientists betting that you WONT.</p>

<p>The survival rate is about 98 %, so of course your chance are pretty good. It's a bet with a 2% chance of losing. </p>
<p>You are the one spreading misinformation, for the the content of the vaccine, the number of death, the survival rate, pretty much every thing you are saying is misinformation.</p>

        <p>That's a very reductive and narrow view. One the reasons it takes time is to gather data, however here the trials were made a much larger scale.</p>
<p>The toxicity can be known in a few months of trials, because of the large sample size and the fact it's a continuous exposition to the vaccine substance. It's a not a regular drug.</p>
<p>We also need to wait longer to know the long term immunity, while it's important data it's not necessary for mass vaccination in case of a pandemic.</p>

        <p>Look it up for yourself. This vaccine couldn't get FDA approval with the amount of reactions it's causing. And that's just the short term ones that the doctors are willing to report. Most of the reactions are going unreported because they refuse to link the reactions to the vaccine. Oh wait. You can't look anything up anymore. Cause google stopped working lol</p>

        <p>The official numbers of deaths by this jab is already well over what it would take to get FDA approval. As for the graphene, I'm referring to a study done by a Spanish university: a scientific report that just came out from the University of Almería School of Engineering in Spain entitled, “Graphene Oxide Detection in Aqueous Suspension: Observational Study in Optical and Electron Microscopy”, where it was found that each dose of the Pfizer shot “was found to contain 6 ng of RNA and 747 ng of graphene oxide, which is 99.103% of the medication.</p>

        <p>Yes you should trust actual scientists. Like the guy who invented MRNA that says these vaccines are dangerous. The guy who invented the PCR test who says it's useless for detecting the infection of a virus, and the ex vice president of Pfizer who says these mRNA vaccines are dangerous and people who took them will probably die when they get re-exposed to the wild virus. I'll trust the scientists who said that all we needed for protection was zinc, vitamin d, and maybe some ivermectin if things get too bad. Not the scientists trying to sell patented concoctions, the ones promoting unpatentable remedies that boost our body's natural immune system and stand to profit nothing from saying so.</p>

        <p>The person who invented mRNA is a woman and was ridiculed by the medical community for saying mRNA could ever be a viable way of vaccination… and now it’s being used to study a vaccine for advanced melanoma. So what exactly is your point because now mRNA vaccines are starting to be studied for stuff like the common cold and they aren’t seeing any of the side effects your claiming. I’m not saying it’s 100% safe because nothing is. But if you want to really see what’s killing people try pronouncing some of the compounds in our processed food.</p>

        <p>Alright I’ll go slow because clearly you have never worked on an peer reviewed study. Multiple scientists have worked on the mRNA vaccine idea. Malone was just the first to create what I’d describe as a proof a concept with no goal of vaccinating a specific illness. Karikó and Weissman were the ones who actually got it to function as Malone envisioned. I’m sorry bud Malone is just an old washed up doctor who is trying to steer business towards his bioethics business that he’s been in for the last several years. The guy hasn’t worked in this field in almost 2 decades. If he shows up on tucker Carlson’s talk show he might be a little too politically opinionated to take all of your advice from.</p>

        <p>I’m not disagreeing with that. A healthy level of skepticism is alright. But we haven’t studied the long term effects on vaping, cannabis, prolonged social media use in early adolescence and a lot more common things in our lives either. Your just overly paranoid because you have been so gaslighted by this little echo chamber and the hot dogshit being posted online without any peer review. Your not going to be discriminated against just because u didn’t get the vaccine because we have HIPAA laws. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson are not objective sources of information FYI.</p>

        <p>I’m confused what your point is here? I was referring to the health safety of vapes. And well you actually can’t use a vape or any tobacco product in a grocery store. Eitherway. Do you live in France? If so I’m sorry and I disagree with that law. But in the U.S. we have HIPAA laws which make it illegal for most businesses to request to see your medical records. On the CDC’s website they say the majority of vaccine side effects occur within 6 months of receiving and that long term side effects are unlikely but they are continuously monitoring the effects of bad lots, manufacturing process or the vaccine itself.</p>

        <p>Your confused as to the point of my meme? Read it again. "Wouldn't it be misinformation to claim a drug is safe and effective if there aren't any long term studies" the CDC says it's in clinical trials until 2023 yet they claim it's safe and effective. No, I don't live in France. But here in America we used to have the first amendment right. Freedom to speak (without being censored) and freedom to assemble. In the last year we forced people to stop assembling. So I think Americans should be very worried that what happened in Tajikistan and what's happening in France will come here because of complacent trolls like you, sir.</p>

        <p>My issue is with the general mindset that somehow people are being lied to for some big evil reason. The delta variant is still killing a ton of people in the US and the rate at which people are dying from the vaccine is a fraction of covids death. Would u rather have the long term side effects of covid turning your lungs to confetti? Also if your want to throw around the freedom card in 1916 when the Spanish flu hit America you would be sent to prison for not wearing a mask when walking around outside. I think we have made some good progress from then dont you? And who tf u calling troll? Your entire profile is just shit posting useless information and then having to argue it to try to prove your point. It seems you are the one trolling. I simply enjoy a good debate and trying to understand people like you.</p>

        <p>I got the vaccine and fully understood the risks it held because I asked friends in the medical field rather than read the pamphlet handed out. However I understand that it’s literally impossible to push a vaccine without thorough intital human trials. I chose to get it to protect my elderly parents and my friends parents because I’m not a selfish jackass who only believes in “protecting my rights” and have some compassion. The earth is gonna be uninhabitable by the end of my life anyways so why not get the vaccine and enjoy life again without worrying about killing my loved ones.</p>

It may take the form of "incessant, bad-faith invitations to engage in debate". The term originated with a 2014 strip of the webcomic Wondermark by David Malki.</p>

        <p>It's a bit more complicated than that. The vaccine is currently a good way to protect yourself and others. </p>
<p>However if others doesn't vaccinate, then it doesn't help people that can't vaccinate. It's selfish of them. </p>
<p>Moreover the higher the number of idiots not vaccinating, the higher the risk of new strains developing, new strains that could circumvent vaccination.</p>

<p>That's wrong because either symptomatic, asymptomatic and vaccinated people can get infected and therefore the virus could possibly develop new resistance.</p>
<p>New variant emerge from very dense group of individuals it has been the case with vizon's species in Europe that's why farmer had to kill a vast majority. The rest is just speculation.</p>

        <p>Since vaccinated people are less likely to be infected, and to infect others, then they do curb the chance of getting new strains. It's purely a number game. </p>
<p>New strains emerge randomly because of mutations, for it to spread, it does need a group of individuals, ideally non vaccinated people of course. But after that, once it reached critical threshold it will propagate more easily.</p>

<p>The vaccine is most likely not going to kill you if it hasn't already in the first few weeks of getting it.</p>
<p>Without any long term studies though, along with an observed non reporting of vaccine side effects, there's no way to know the likely hood of any long term adverse health effects, like an increased risk of cancer or similar</p>

        <p>In a Facebook post more like it. After about a day of research the only evidence I found was the opposite of this claim. About 6 google search pages long of refuting evidence. Also if you actually read the trials where those claims originated they weren’t using mRNA delivery systems in the trial.</p>

        <p>That's because google, the fact checkers, the media, and the government's have all been paid off. You'll believe what you need to believe in order to not feel like you made the wrong decision. The fact is. Right there on the CDC's website it says that these vaccines are approved for emergency use only, and that we are in clinical trials till 2023. Talk to me then, if you're still breathing.</p>

        <p>Well not getting the vaccine doesn’t automatically put you in the control group. I think your assuming somehow the whole population is being studied. If you haven’t been contacted by a specific research group then you probably aren’t in a control. Also currently your “control group” is still dying by the hundreds every day so I think that’s a good support for my argument. Currently the rate at which people are having adverse side effects to the vaccine is 0.0017% in the US in 6 months of vaccinations. Covid death rate is 1.8% in the US. Doing that math then. COVID is 1058x more deadly. Facts don’t have feelings is the old saying right?</p>

        <p>No those adverse reactions numbers are from ANY hospitalizations and ANY deaths of people getting the vaccine. I can go on and on bro. You want sources to help or will that encourage you to double down even more? I’m confused you pout that hundreds of people dying a day from covid is nothing yet a whole total 5000 having a reaction over 6 months to a shot is scary to your little mind? It sounds like you have more of a problem with control. Sorry your fragile concept of “normal” was shattered in 2020. Fun fact: most of the compounds added to our food haven’t been tested for long term effects either and those have millions of dollars being poured into making sure the research never happens.</p>

        <p>I’m not trying to tell people what to do with their bodies. I’m against that. I’m a fuckin hippy bro lol. I just hate how much people are focused on the whole vaccine thing and acting as if it were the end of the human race and some big conspiracy. Get the vaccine or don’t get the vaccine idrc. The majority of my friends aren’t vaxxed. They just don’t spend all day shit posting and pretending to act discriminated against. There are bigger things we gotta deal with as a society and real “conspiracies” where conglomerates are destroying the planet and poisoning the human race right in front of us.</p>

        <p>I find this so funny. Trump encouraged people to take the "vaccine" that HE made yet the dems still say that the reason we wont take it is because of Trumpism. If Trumpism was real it would make us want to take it. I even got banned from a sub for saying "You don't have to be a Trump supporter to not want to be a lab rat." </p>
<p>For the record I am a Trump supporter and considering how horribly the covid shot is hurting people I think project warp speed is close to if not his greatest mistake.</p>

        <p>Yep, it's ironic because some of the top Trump supporters I know are also the ones most against the arm poke.   Maybe trump tended to attract the more defiant types in general.  Also the pro trumpers do tend to more vehemently follow his 'don't trust the media' narrative which might be the one thing I agree with him most on, although I don't trust the republican slanted media either. Personally I don't trust either side of the politicians so I feel zero urge to follow what any of them say.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%. Ive been Republican since I was old enough to vote. Not anymore, thanks to Trump I see they are all just establishment skum just like the Democrats. I use to vote based on a politicians voting record but I see now that even that is deceptive so I have no idea how vote anymore. The only one I trust that actually stands for America and its people is Trump. So I guess I'll just vote for whoever he endorses.</p>

        <p>They are certainly the better option but the only reason I haven't voted them before was because I didn't think they stood a chance at winning. Even before Trump I was starting to think of Republicans as the better of two evils, but now I see they aren't even that. Even if Libertarians have no chance of winning I will probably vote for a few of them.</p>

        <p>Just an honest question… </p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies and our corporatocracy led western governments, they’re all magnanimous altruists right? </p>
<p>Like it’s really that simple vaccines = normalcy? </p>
<p>That’s it right? Don’t need to question geneticists… they’ve figured out all the variables… in fact they’re so intellectually superior that every conceivable outcome has been taken into account… all long term data accounted for… nothing else to ponder or question… just shut up and take the vaccine right? </p>
<p>We shouldn’t question western medicine… like how obesity, mal nutrition, envionrmental factors , access to healthcare has had a direct impact on covid death tolls… only age demographics and genetic abnormalities effect covid death tolls… that other stuff like promoting healthy lifestyles, good nutrition or investing in making all food affordable, tasty, easy to make but most importantly healthy is not feasible… it’s take away too much from the current profits eh… remember when the Obamas tried to revamp the nutrition system in schools… only to be stymied by lobbyists and corporate greed right?</p>
<p>So we live in a western culture where everything we have is at the expense, misery and exploitation of the entire planet around us… that’s all good right? </p>
<p>Western culture and our current medical system shares no blame in having a populace where obesity is normalized and promoted through capitalist ideals… you are aware that more people are dying from obesity related illnesses right now than starvation right? </p>
<p>How about 7 to 8 million dying each year from air pollution… don’t care about that right? </p>
<p>Ever read the book <em>lifespan by David Sinclair</em> or <em>homo deus by yuval harari</em>… billionaires invested billions upon billions of dollars to seek medical technology only whose only aim is to prolong the lifespans of the ultra rich… sounds like science fiction… but it’s not… it’s happening right now… </p>
<p>Or how about the fact that humans are facing the most critical 10 to 15 years to reverse climate change from tipping points. We already have Bio diversity loss. Extreme Forrest fires. Droughts. Frequent and severe hurricanes and adverse weather patterns. Alarming loss of rain forrests. 50 percent of coral reefs decimated. Dwindling resouces. Finite resources already being plundered. 8 billion humans. Chinese fishing armadas decimating fish populations in international waters and off the shores of sovereign nations unable to defend themselves never mind ourselves doing the exact same… </p>
<p>You think technocratic elites and those holding the reigns of power are oblivious to these realities? Your think they care about the masses and not their own skin? They already have the resources to solve world hunger and other world issues… but no, extending their own lifespans and investments in space exploration far out weigh the needs of the masses… </p>
<p>Why not have a virus and vaccine cull 8 billion humans off through varied death statistics over the next 10 to 15 years… of course this is just a conspiracy theory… could be so far from the truth… but to not even toy with this possibility is a fallacy in critical thought… with all the money in the world… they wouldn’t think like you and I. </p>
<p>Or… </p>
<p>Maybe it is intended for the greater good… and the vaccine roll out was meted out to save humanity from a virus that has over a 99% survival rate for healthy inidividuals that have taken care of themselves… but like all good intentions under human endeavours many turn out to be calamities because we humans tend to be over confident… think world war 1 (the war to end all wars) or world war 2 (Nazis didn’t think what they were doing was evil, but rather nessasary to save humanity and the German people through eugenics and genocide) or the benefits of the oil boom and global economic growth… look where that got us… (hint no where better, in fact worse off) in any event it’s a leap a faith thinking all will pan out with a vaccine that has no long term data… and we’re demonized for even trying to take a step back and think maybe a historians route would be well applied cause hind sight is one hell of a thing… but I understand how that’s part of the problem when people want results now… so governments and big pharm dole out the “ballyhoo” in spades… and need to keep that narrative front row and centre to look important and like saviours to the masses. </p>
<p>Remember whether it’s an autrocractic or democratic nation consolidation of power has always been and forever will be primary objective number 1… and that’s just political science 101. </p>
<p>Remember we’re all just cognitive dissonant, dunning Kruger affected, hypocritical, self perceived intellectual elitists in here. We never question ourselves and seldom question those who don’t question themselves cause it makes us feel safe… </p>
<p>Here’s some books… I hate avant guard articles… there’s too many to keep on top of… and I can’t pay for the exonomist, the New York Times and a whole bunch of other well renowned acedemia… anyway I don’t have a analytical mind… but anyway they’re well renowned and paint a fairly accurate view of the world we live in.. </p>

<p>my vaccination wasn't forced, and i don't think yours was too. </p>
<p>&rt;strengthen their positions and everyone else gets polarized and divided am I right!?</p>
<p>the "rich and elite" are vaccinated too. and once you're vaccinated, there wouldn't be any "divide" in this aspect. </p>
<p>also, you've posted a lot, that's a steep slippery slope, i don't know where you get the idea from but i've never spoke about those nor do i agree with them.</p>

<p>You can also go to stats canada to see how excess deaths from causes other than covid are several times higher than deaths due to covid under the age of 65. This specific report does not include the number of suicides… the 270 000 delayed surgeries, and 1 million missed cancer screenings… </p>
<p>So you go to Ontario health.ca and get to the data link it’s under covid case numbers and spread… make sure to put the data in table graph format </p>
<p>https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data#case_numbers_and_spread </p>
<p>Then you can go here and look at opioid deaths and overdose which they’ll conveniently say it’s only an increase in accidental overdoses… </p>
<p>https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/o/2020/opioid-mortality-covid-surveillance-report.pdf?la=en</p>
<p>And now for some reason I can’t access the mental health, facts and statistics at the camp.ca website… they’re excluding suicide data after 2019 on Canada.ca so maybe they’re updating the latest info/statistics… </p>
<p>So I’m just trying to point out that all this information is available yet you have to dig for it… because in reality a government party is not going to be <em>critical</em> about itself or admit any short comings lol… nor are they going to be transparent… but such is the reality we live in… </p>
<p>You can also look up Roman Baber an MP in Ontario where he has compiled a lot of the statistics and made them available and accessible through his platforms…</p>

        <p>okay, FIFO. excess death due to drug abuse. </p>
<p><em>deaths attributed to causes associated with substance use and misuse, including unintentional (accidental) poisonings and diseases and conditions related to alcohol consumption.</em></p>
<p>see, i really find it harder to empathize with drug abuser than people who's contracted covid. for a first, the people engaged in a high risk activity, voluntarily, and put themselves in harm's way on purpose. covid victims on the other hand are just going on their d2d activity. yes, of course if given a choice i'd try to save both. most humans would, but if i have to choose to focus on the safety of one over the other, i'm sorry i'd choose to keep people safe from covid rather than drug abusers.</p>
<p>i don't quite get the opiod part, they say that it may be use for treatment, but only a certain group is affected typically poorer males, does that mean they're abusing it ?</p>

        <p>Well that’s just it… your thinking correct, we have less empathy for those who chose a unhealthy life style whether it be drugs/ alcohol and or smoking etc… yet you can apply that same logic to swaths of demographics that engage in unhealthy eating habits (just because your obese doesn’t mean I have less empathy for you it means I have more and I’ll explain)… the covid spike protein binds to fat molecules and replicates faster in obese individuals… so now when I try to point this is out I’m not laying blame on obese people its not the individuals fault… it’s our capitalist western culture that’s to blame… our very institutions that promote and normalize this culture… it’s not fair that working class individuals subsist on high processed, easy to make, tasty, high sugar and high fat foods to get by… the very system you and I are defending is the culprit in making the covid death tolls what they are! We have the resources and profits to make all food available to the masses extremely tasty, easy to make but most importantly healthy but choose not to.. because profits? Like I said earlier the obamas even tried revamping the school nutrition system only to be stymied by lobbyists that have a vested interest in our current nutrition structure… so the system receives none of the blame… us poor demographics lay blame on eachother while the elites that hold the reigns of power continue with their machinations while sharing no blame when there needs to be systematic change on there end… do you get what I’m saying?</p>

<p>well put ! yes and no. I live in a state where people are generally healthier. yes we have mcdonalds and burger king here but we don't binge on them. we exercise discipline, to a certain extent, when it comes to physical fitness, and as a result we're able to keep our obesity rate &lt;15%.</p>
<p>&rt; We have the resources and profits to make all food available to the masses extremely tasty, easy to make but most importantly healthy but choose not to.. because profits? </p>
<p>lets take a step back and think about the exact opposite. if governments control what can be sold or what can't be sold. you'd lose companies coming in to invest. there'd be no more KFC or Wendys (just randomly naming). they can't sell coca colas anymore, only coke zero. no more beer, just water.. yes we'd be healthier but morally ? isn't it better to just cultivate discipline ?</p>
<p>&rt;there needs to be systematic change on there end</p>
<p>what do you think should be done on their end ?</p>

        <p>What should be done?… well for one, at the very least, it should be a mandatory prerequisite for health professionals practising medicine to have at least a basic form of training or foundation in the importance of proper nutrition and the benefits thereof. </p>
<p>A campaign from arbiters of power, wealth and media moguls to advertise the importance of living a healthy lifestyle and proper nutrition. </p>
<p>Our Education system emphasizing proper nurition and lifestyle just as much as how gym class is mandatory until a certain grade. </p>
<p>Forcing what people should and shouldn’t eat would be immoral right? But if the crux of our comorbidities comes from a western diet and is ultimately what is effecting covid death tolls than at the <em>very least</em> the issue should be addressed. Not with draconian measures… but awareness and a push to expose this notion with much more emphasis and importance. </p>
<p>We occupy an existence where we think just because we live in a democracy that we’re immune to brainwashing and control. We think Russians and North Koreans are brainwashed yet a proportion of demographics under those regimes certainly know their plight and reality… I find we ourselves have this ability less so than other more controlled and propagandized states… </p>
<p>at the end of the day I’m an uneducated poor person… and my autonomity is all I got left…the narrative is as follows… the unvaxxed are uneducated, dumb people… fair enough… even all the minorities… all the demographics… just simply questioning things we’re still deemed stupid… yet we fail to address that intelligence is relative… yes someone may have an analytical mind that puts a SAT score or such as a measure of superiority… but that’s a messed up way of thinking… </p>
<p>We don’t question the PCR test. </p>
<p>We don’t think or talk about the law of declining virulence. </p>
<p>The fact that the virus is endemic. </p>
<p>That we <em>do</em> have a population problem. </p>
<p>That the earths resources <em>are</em> finite. That the population problem exasperates the “resource” problem based on our unabated consumerism and how that’s integral for the continued ideals of free market capitlism and globalization and how that ultimately will lead to collapse. </p>
<p>You must know this right? We’re getting to 8 billion humans my friend… 8 billion… you don’t think people on the inside are fully oblivious to this trajectory we’re on?? That they’re just going to let it happen or “wager” on technological solutions to solve these realities? </p>
<p>I’ll probaly be forced to get the vaccine anyway once’s it’s mandatory… and in 10 years time you can always save this conversation and say “I told you so! You were overthinking things silly man” and fair enough… </p>
<p>But for for fun watch these things for your weekend entertainment… I’m assuming your already vaccinated so you watch them as infotainment… </p>
<p>Seaspiracy on Netflix - there’s plenty of science and fact checkers to undermine its message… but that’s with everything these days… or maybe some literature… not sure if I gave you a list before… but here’s them again I guess… the uninhabitable earth - David Wallace wells (plenty of science to dissuade any alarm posed by the writer of this book too… suggesting because he’s a historian/journalist and not a climatogolists you shouldn’t consider anything he has to say… I guess “forwards” and bibliographies don’t mean crap anymore) or big world, little planet - johan Nordstrom. this changes everything - Naomi Klein (again another one with plenty of “science influencers to denounce it or undermine it) drawdown by Paul hawken or the new climate war by micheal E mann. </p>
<p>Or lifespan by David Sinclair… rich people are really into living super long lives intact a ton of resources and medical advancements are going into just that! We’re just statistics btw… if there’s a population problem they def don’t have averages joes like us taking more of the environmental pie… </p>
<p>I think I gave you a list of books already no? In any case if you don’t want to read books maybe videos could be better… </p>
<p>And remember I know this could be just “infotainment” to you… and you could just scoff it off and I wouldn’t blame you at all! Like not one bit! Maybe just watch it for fun, it’s interesting non the less… </p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8alro6mjcsU</p>
<p>Or watch this one from one medical professionals sceptical view of the vaccines… he fully admits to it being speculation but just something to consider… skip the Derek Sloan the government MP at the begining go right to roughly around the 9 minute mark… </p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KkkXntGcqac</p>
<p>Anyway man… what are your thoughts…</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the PCR test, the cycles and thresholds and kary mullis’ being harshly critical of his own invention? You can google him and find plenty articles that slander him for believing in such things as astrology and what not… but that doesn’t take away from the genius and his expertise in his related field right?</p>

        <p>&rt;what’s your rational regarding pharmaceutical companies and there track record on the international scene with regards to these links too?</p>
<p>it's a huge company from mid 1800s.. i'm trying to play the devil's advocate here, but are there ANY organization that's older than a century old that's free of scandal ? does scandal mar the reliability of its product ? pfizer is a company that's 172 years old, and have the staff strength of nearly 79k workers, Merck, 130 years old, 75k employees, i mean even Harvard has its scandals. but does it mean it can't produce quality students ? that's a legitimate question for you.. (think about it, even catholic churches are riddled with scandals, christians too, you have pastors out rightly scamming money or molesting their flock, does it mean god isn't trustworthy or faith misplaced ?)</p>
<p>IF you're that worried about companies with less than stellar record, i don't see Moderna there, would you trust their vaccine more ?</p>
<p>&rt;kary mullis’ being harshly critical of his own invention?</p>
<p>got a link ? it's his creation, but if the practitioners of PCR or whoever that took over and refined it can vouch for its reliability, would you believe in it ?</p>
<p>&rt; but that doesn’t take away from the genius and his expertise in his related field right?</p>
<p>a question i can ask you, Stella Immanuel, a registered physician that even Trump quoted claimed that she has cured over a hundred covid 19 patients with hydroxychloroquine. swears by it. would you believe her ? never mind that she also say that uterine disorder endometriosis is caused by sex with demons that takes place in dreams, or that gynecological issues are the result of having sex with witches and demons (“succubi” and “incubi”) in dreams, that shouldn't take away the fact that's she's a practicing physician in texas right ? she's an MD after all.</p>

        <p>Yup scandal is as old as time… yet those links are not from 100 years ago but rather recent… you could say the vaccine is effective because it’s economical though… but 2 years into this and the brightest and best don’t have any promising treatments… I thought in science you’re suppose to <em>treat</em> the disease and that’s where the biggest emphasis lies with regards to any type of disease people are currently suffering from. </p>
<p>Btw I’m an atheist. </p>
<p>I’m also Canadian and I think trump is a demagogue idiot. </p>
<p>I think you have a skewed idea as to who I am as a person. And that’s the unfortunate thing about online discourse… I’d much rather have this talk in person over a cup of coffee… it’s shame we have to hostile to eachother on media platforms… It’s strange not being able to see any type of debate or discussion regarding covid IRL because it’s taboo… or even on the media since debate and discussion is a pillar of the scientific method… yet censorship, silencing, ad hominein reign supreme… have you listened to other doctors voice concerns like dr, byrim brindle, </p>
<p>I live in Ontario and work in private avaition. Medical contracts like organ, medical personnel, and patient tranfers have deemed us essential and kept me employed through out the pandemic… my wife is a one on one personal trainer but has lost her business due to covid lockdowns and just ekes out a living with half her clientele through online sessions… meanwhile you could still book a massage throughout the pandemic… I have a 2 year old and a 4 years still going to daycare… what has your experience been like? </p>
<p>Fox News is propaganda…  </p>
<p>CNN is propaganda… </p>
<p>I believe in books yet no one I know reads books anymore and I find that a fallacy especially in my working class demographic. </p>
<p>Im a realist so I understand no matter what your not going to get everyone vaccinated. Hell we couldn’t even get people to social distance or wear masks… </p>
<p>So you don’t believe in the law of declining virulence? When it comes to covid? </p>
<p>I know I’m not a smart man… I have many flaws, I don’t have a analytical mind, I question myself all the time, I’ll admit I’m a hypocrit, cognitive dissonance, dunning Kruger, self perceived intellectualism… you name it… I think I’ve mentioned it before. </p>
<p>I just think when it comes to this specific vaccine we’ve jumped the gun… I understand it’s been in development for 10 to 20 years but it’s asking us to put a lot of faith in the most enlightened geneticists and scientists our planet has to offer… yet one can also say that we as a species are extremely over confident… the vaccine had good intentions but a doubt every single variable and nuance has been taken into account when no long term data exists for human trials. I’m firm believer in the historians route so to wait 10 years for hindsight after any significant event and I see how that can be a problem when people are clamouring for a quick fix yesterday. </p>
<p>I can conduct a risk assessment based on my actions so as to minimize unnessacary interactions with people at risk and just people in general… we’ve had a strict lock down in my province… and have actually had a virus back in 2019 before the virus made headlines, that made me cough up blood, fever and had a weird taste… so you might say “there you go… why would you want someone to experience what you did” well it just so happened that I was a heavy smoker for 15 years and basically ate like an idiot… fast food for lunch… meat for breakfast lunch and dinner so no sympathy for me… I have since stopped smoking, drinking, and eating the way I use to and have never felt better… started exercising and lost 30 pounds… and havnt been sick since… I’ve been tested 5 times for covid through out the pandemic and all came back negative… so I have a real chip on my shoulder when it comes to our current medical system and narrative regarding the vaccines… we don’t want to take responsibility for ourselves but rather choose forced vaccinations and medical apartheid over rationality… because we’re all fearful reactionaries… no more moderates… I’m sorry if that seems callous to you but that’s the truth from my personal experience… I’ll also like to point out that the rich carried on in my business with Impunity… yet here we are fighting amongst ourselves… </p>
<p>So doctors that are putting their careers on the line like Bryam bridle, Anthony Murdoch, dr Charles hoffe, are just payed by opposition to promote distrust?</p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KkkXntGcqac</p>
<p>You can skip the first speaker he’s just an MP with no medical background you can fast forward to minute 9… </p>
<p>There are many more scientists and doctors that want to talk openly about the everything and have accessible discussions regarding everything that’s happening yet it’s not allowed… you don’t find that strange? </p>
<p>And I digress… </p>
<p>I sincerely ask what has your personal experience been like through out all of this?</p>

        <p>&rt;yet those links are not from 100 years ago but rather recent</p>
<p>i would think they each have their fair share over the years. </p>
<p>&rt;you could say the vaccine is effective because it’s economical though</p>
<p>it is more than that.. it helps bring down cases as well, the mortality rate is far lower now, even with the rise in cases.</p>
<p>&rt;I thought in science you’re suppose to treat the disease and that’s where the biggest emphasis lies with regards to any type of disease people are currently suffering from.</p>
<p>yes, and we all want that, but there are things we can't yet fight or have answers to.. vaccine is the best we get at the moment.</p>
<p>&rt;I think you have a skewed idea as to who I am as a person.</p>
<p>i really don't, i assess based on what i see only, i try not to make up the missing pieces.. assumption is bad.. </p>
<p>&rt;I’d much rather have this talk in person over a cup of coffee</p>
<p>yes and no, yes it'll be a lot more forthcoming, and no because a lot of info shared requires that bit of research that won't be readily available over coffee..</p>
<p>&rt;it’s shame we have to hostile to eachother on media platforms</p>
<p>hahaha, and trust me when i say this, i wasn't hostile, at least not my tone.. i'm very very neutral when talking to you.. </p>
<p>&rt;It’s strange not being able to see any type of debate or discussion regarding covid IRL because it’s taboo… or even on the media since debate and discussion is a pillar of the scientific method… yet censorship, silencing, ad hominein reign supreme</p>
<p>are we not having the debate now ? and we've avoided ad hominein so far</p>
<p>&rt;have you listened to other doctors voice concerns</p>
<p>yes, there's always another, always. the thing is if there's 4 voices to 1, which would you pick ? i would listen to all, but when it comes to decision making, majority still wins..</p>
<p>&rt;my wife is a one on one personal trainer but has lost her business due to covid lockdowns and just ekes out a living with half her clientele through online sessions</p>
<p>i truly empathise with your wife's situation, i do hope that ontario offers some sort of rebate or incentive to help support certain industry. i'm in education, lucky enough to be employed during this period as my friends (aviation and PT) struggled. they took to different routes, some changing careers, some taking on part time jobs, if anything, covid made us resilient</p>
<p>&rt; what has your experience been like?</p>
<p>apart from the transition to working from home, nothing huge. my friends in different industry tends to branch out a bit, food catering as a side hustle, our government is kind enough to provide rental waiver for certain gyms etc. i don't have kids yet so the affect isn't as much as yours i guess.. finance aside, i don't think it's impossible for your wife to see it as some of blessing to be able to spend more time with the kids... you think ?</p>
<p>&rt;Fox News is propaganda…</p>
<p>CNN is propaganda…</p>
<p>which isn't ? even this sub is propaganda, but there's always a measure of truth, some more than the others, that we need to sieve </p>
<p>&rt;So you don’t believe in the law of declining virulence? When it comes to covid?</p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/will-coronavirus-really-evolve-to-become-less-deadly-153817">i'm a realist too</a></p>
<p>&rt;I know I’m not a smart man… I have many flaws</p>
<p>dude, you're smarter than a lot of people here, trust me on that, i've spoke to many. i can't believe that they'd exist in the age on internet..</p>
<p>&rt;I just think when it comes to this specific vaccine we’ve jumped the gun</p>
<p>your opinion is fair and justified. if given the space and time, i'm sure many who've taken the jab would've opt to wait. but time is a luxury we don't have in this pandemic.. sort of like how it's always good to change the wheel of a car when it's stopped, but when you have people running after you, you'd have to change that wheel on the go..</p>
<p>&rt;I’m firm believer in the historians route</p>
<p>trust me, 5 years down the road people who would've used this as a case study and pick out 100 things that gov could've done better. BUT, many of those people may NOT be there those wait and see route is taken..</p>

<p>the rich like ? trust me, i'm not part of the bourgeoisie, not even close, but there's a reason why they're different, and i think it's odd that we think people like them should operate the same as us. they're elite for a reason, like how you wouldn't expect the queen of england to queue at mcdonalds if she feels like eating fries. we're not all equal and that should be okay (to an extent). we're not talking about murder or crimes here of course</p>

<p>i really don't know .. maybe, maybe not.. but lets consider that they really believe in what they're advocating and they're correct. so they're 3 correct doctors. say if i can find 30 doctors advocating the exact opposite, would you follow the majority ?</p>

        <p>Part 1. Sorry it’s a whopper of a reply. </p>
<p>I’m wondering if you got my other reply to your comment that wasn’t on this current thread, by any chance? I’d like to know your thoughts on that… </p>
<p>Never the less. Vaccines = normalcy is just too simplistic for me to get on board with.
Consider… if we did end up vaccinating the entire world… and there was no push back, and everyone did it willingly. That’d be great right? Yet that’s not reality. At this point the covid is endemic. It will continue to mutate and become what the Spanish flu is… and other viruses that are now just the common cold. We’re entering a world of hyper irrational fear. It’s pushed by big pharma and governments as a form of ballyhoo in a show of their importance and our dependence on them. like I said in my earlier post… a constant ad and marketing campaign in conjunction with the vaccine roll out promoting healthy lifestyles and exercise would heed better results now and especially in the long term of any functioning society and if that narrative was perpetrated by our establishments I’d be considering getting the vaccine more seriously… but that narrative seems to be opposed to certain institutions that have politicians in their back pocket (mainly food, sugar, meat and diarycompanies) ever read the book “how not to die by micheal e Gregor” many solutions in that book that would not entirely topple those industry’s and the jobs they create.. but actively empowering people with healthy lives to better fight off viruses and disease while also creating a new systematic system of nutrition that’s sustainable and will create jobs and industry. It shouldn’t be “no! Just vaccines!” “It should be both” just rationally speaking. There <em>is</em> a link between obesity and covid death tolls that seldom gets addressed by media platforms. Like I’ll say again mal nutrition, and environmental factors. Yet only age demographics and genetic adnormalites are the key talking points in mainstream media… so as to absolve our government and corporate lobbyists of any blame for our current predicament. </p>
<p>I’ll give you an example… I got some people I work with that flat out deny that covid even exists… I have one gentlemen, in his mid 50s, lives up North and is an outspoken supporter of trump… (and yes he is Canadian) he’s a drinker, just recently quite smoking and has a physical appearance that suggests he’s never exercised, you could mistake him for someone in their mid 60s. For him I’d say yes… he should definitely consider the vaccine… yet he is outspoken and is against it. I wouldn’t want to force it on him but I think it would be prudent for him to atleast consider. Now when the argument that healthy people need to get the vaccine to protect him… rationally speaking I know I don’t have to shake his hand… come in close contact with him… I can wear a mask when I speak to him (and always wear one regardless mind you)… and limit any unessary contact… wouldn’t that work? Or does the hypotheticals outweigh rationality because we live in heightened state of reactionary fear.</p>
<p>I’m also going to have to respectfully disagree with you regarding a meeting and having a discussion in person. Already now with the discussion we’ve had my “hostility, and ad hominein” remark was taken out of context… I meant that in the grand discourse of online discussion not the conversation you and I are having… it is very amicable and respectful. Also we could always take our phones and lab tops if we wanted to reference something we couldn’t from our memory. </p>
<p>I don’t think the debate you and I are having is anywhere close to the discussion on media platforms. And I’d much rather see experts debate the issue with transparency… rather than the one you and I are having now. </p>
<p>With regards to scientific discussion and your 1 to 4 remark indicating that the majority should be taken with more vigor than the minority I totally get that point… yet the opposite could be applied… much throughout history it was usually the minority or fringe sciences and dissent that instituted change. Or contrarian thought that shed light on things missed by the “majority” or “established doctrine/narrative” one silly example and probaly not the best analogy could be the best candle makers in the world didn’t invent the lightbulb… I’m sure there are far better examples to point out… </p>
<p>With regards to the rich… I don’t think people grasp how far inequality has gotten… I hate recommending a Netflix show because I know a single documentary can not sum up all you need to know about a topic especially something “economical in nature”… but the documentary “capitol” really puts into perspective on a surface level how bad it really is and I can’t recommend it enough… I’m no economics major but freakonomics was a cool read. </p>
<p>I think they’re far more “caligulas” holding high positions of power in governments and corporate ladders than we’re willing to admit and that they are more nuanced and far more machavillian in nature… whether autocratic or democratic we all know political science dictates that the <em>consolidation of power</em> is primary objective number 1… it’s what all forms of government share in common… so the virus is real and has created a vacuum of opportunity for these actors to mete out their machinations for better or for worse… only time will tell. But they know far more than you and I… and can manipulate and play the masses for there own gains whatever they might be… but having the lower classes being more critical of them is definitely not one of them… rationally speaking. Just because we’re democratic and not living under Putin or North Korea doesn’t mean we’re exempt from a different kind of brainwashing… one that promotes unabated capitalism and the thought that we can all make something of ourselves when in reality the system is stacked against us. Maybe I’m too cynical or Hobbesian in outlook… but I’d rather that than blissful and ignorant to reality… even if you and other consider this to be “the best we got” it might actually be the worst for humanity and our planet. Just thinking outside the box here</p>

        <p>Part 2 </p>
<p>We are also aware of the Chinese fishing fleets… basically massive armadas of trollers and fishing vessels just plundering the bio diversity of oceans in international waters… even going as far as to fish off the coasts of sovereign nations unable to defend themselves… usually US intervention has to push off these fleets… yet we do the same thing to our oceans. </p>
<p>So we’re suffering from massive bio diversity loss. Tipping points being crossed to the point where nothing can be reversed. It’s been just recently reported that the Amazon rain forest which was a basin for carbon absorption is now doing the opposite and is <em>emitting more carbon</em> back into the atomosphere. Extreme droughts. Forest fires. More frequent and severe Hurricanes. Floodings. Melting ice caps. And our western culture is the culprit… globalization and unabated consumerism is making this the reality… we all live like kings and queens did more than a 100 years ago… instead of servants we have dish washing machines, vacuums and technology to do that bidding… and chinas vast growing economy and middle classes want the same benefits and lifestyle as their western counterparts… we all know earths resources are finite and dwindling… so to avoid global conflict or mass migrations/exodus’ of mass populations from uninhabitable regions over the potential next 10 to 20 years why not have a culling of varied death statistics…  that would take place in the same amount of time as the expert climatogolists are saying the next 10 to 20 years are the most crucial in human existence to stop climate change…now I know that’s a far fetched conspiracy theory and very unlikely… yet nobody even wants to address that potential because of how scary it is. Yet I’m willing to admit I’m wrong about it… but with 8 billion needy humans it’s hard to shrug off. </p>
<p>Nevertheless a mere 75 years ago Hitler and the Nazis carried out a eugenics and genocide program not because they knew and wanted to do something evil… but because what they thought they were doing something to benefit humanity and the Germans… therefore justifying their actions as nessary… </p>
<p>In the 70s you were considered a looney for saying that the CIA used its power to overthrow South American governments for easy and cheap access to fruit and resources… yet now that is common and accepted knowledge about the banana republics. </p>
<p>Like I said earlier I’m more inline with the idea that the vaccines were created with the bests intentions… but with no long term data as to the side effects and even with a “minority” of the scientific community raising concern… it does feel like a leap of faith… and I tend of over think things… not to mention even if I get it… there are still large swaths of populations where the mandating of vaccines are opposed by people and even leaders pushing this agenda… if the virus is endemic… and we’re two years into this… with declining virulence… and the Spanish flu only lasting 2 years with natural herd immunity without vaccines… what’s the point… even when you give me hypotheticals… like I said earlier I’m conducting myself as responsibly as I can… I’m not one of those people that <em>has</em> to go to a crowded concert anymore, or festival or bar and share my latest drink concoction with strangers. </p>
<p>Another issue I have is that there is no “story” for a layman person like myself 10 to 20 years of gene therapy cannot be adequately described in 10 minute YouTube and Tik tok videos about its safety and simplicity… what nuances and variables are we not exposed too that only esoteric researchers would be aware of… once again I’m high lighting humans knack for over estimating ourselves and capabilities…. </p>
<p>So no “story”. Stories are the best way to convey information to idiots like me… yet we don’t even have a begining… lab leak? Gain of function? Zoonotic? Too many questions regarding the origins… and once a origin has been established more questions as to manmade… benelovant or mavalovant in design… I’d lean more toward benelovant reasearch but bio weapon potential can’t be fully cast aside no matter how small the potential for that is… </p>
<p>Anyway… it seems a narrative only focused on “vaccine - normalcy” will limit any more critical though regarding covid… which is probably exactly what they want… you do not be critical of the current medical system, governments, corporate elites, capitalism, and our relationship to it all…
After all we are just statistics. </p>
<p>Read home dues yuval harari and lifespan by David Sinclair you’ll see where billionaires are prioritizing their assets… and it’s not for us… </p>
<p>Anyway… I think we’ll both be beating a dead horse at this point… I’m willing to admit I could very well be wrong and led astray… and that you could have been correct all along… nevertheless I thank you for engaging with me and wish you the very best this life has to offer.</p>

        <p>I don’t know about you, but I’m certainly not gonna trust an entity pushing something that is obviously harming so many, and to people (children) who don’t in any way need it, in spite of that harm. Idk, doesn’t seem trustworthy to me. But either way, I think I’ll save my trust for the facts of what’s happening, rather than stories from those who are making billions from the product (with zero liability, despite thousands of reported severe adverse events). I’m learning to be a teeny bit more careful where I place my trust, thanks.</p>

        <p>they're all just links, there's zero personal attack, but keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better for not being able to come up with a decent rebuttal. ALSO, it was removed today only, it's been there for more than a month btw, if you've something to say you'd have said it already, don't think that the removal worked it your favour at all ;)</p>

        <p>you do know i have other accounts to counter check your claims right ? i see when they're removed, i see when they're up. the previous one was up for a full month, i know because i saw it with another account before pasting over. LOL it's one thing to come up empty during a debate. it's another level of low to have to resort to arguments in this manner.. i can chalk that to your knowledge and exposure, nothing to be shy of.. but this level of denial ? something else entirely..</p>

        <p>is that.. <em>gasps</em>, ad hominem !! lmao. get a grip and stop projecting. I don't run to the mods and cower behind them when i come out short in arguments. i also don't call people crazy instead of answering to a debate. it'll look better on you if you could handle the L better. instead, resorting to crying to mods to remove posts you can't handle, post which are made of just links in fact. LOL !! don't thank me.. thank you for showing me the kind of person you are, don't take the moral highground next ya ? you absolutely do not have any of it in you</p>

        <p>Mental health medication is notorious 
for being ineffective long term. Your body has a nasty habit of adaptation. So medication becomes less and less effective and people who rely on it are forced to switch when it stops working. And although they have to ween you off the current medication it still is a bitch for a few weeks for withdrawals. A friend of mine had unexplained spams that placed him in the hospital for a week. After a few weeks of tests the staff psychologist said two months off the medication mightve caused a "system crash" as it were.</p>

        <p>Offending me does not help the discourse. The manufacturers already ran clinical trials with tens of thousands of people last year in order to even get approval by the dozens of government institutions. Does that mean that all the studies are over? Of course not. Does that mean we have long term studies spanning more than a year? Also no. Does that change anything about the conclusion that so far it seems effevtiveland safe? No.</p>

<p>Nobody has even completed phase lll of studies. </p>
<p>They skipped animal and clinical and went straight to phase lll, and that only means testing 300 people over a year. </p>
<p>When you’ve done that, and then done it again you can move to phase lV, which takes 7 to ten years and CANNOT be rushed by using extra scientists. </p>
<p>After you’ve finished phase lV then you can try it out on the world while keeping a close eye on all who take this newly released vaccine. Pregnant women are never bought in until at least this stage, if even then.</p>

        <p>No, I except that if you're going to reinvent the wheel it's going to take more than a year to do so.  I also don't care about your sources. If you spend 20+ years studying and researching mRNA vaccines and everything that you put into practice always resulted in failure, but somehow you were able to successfully create a working vaccine in just under a year after the pandemic I am going to consider that rushed and highly suspicious.</p>

        <p>Nah man it said all the time. If you go on Instagram or something that attaches covid info it will always say something like safe and effective.</p>
<p>Here are some points from the covid information centre for Instagram, I live in Canada so it will he different if you live in another country. </p>
<p>-vaccines are throughly tested for safety before they are made for the public.</p>
<p>-vaccine side effects are usually mild.</p>
<p>-vaccines are following safety and ethical standards.</p>
<p>I see shit like that all the time.</p>
