    <strong>The Anthropic Division</strong>
    <p><p>I've lost count of the times I've been called a Nazi over the years but then again I was always socially conservative, was strongly against the West's migration policies and hated neoliberalism with a passion. Come to think of it I also knew who manipulated the banks and questioned the conventional accounts of both world wars so I guess it wasn't exactly hard for me to be painted in that light, but it is important that we shouldn't self-identify with the accusations thrown at us by our detractors.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and within the context of planned digital serfdom, all the less important issues seem so insignificant as to become irrelevant. I was always "socially conservative" because I didn't like how neoliberalism was butchering not only my own country's local customs and identity but the entire world's. You go to any country in the world and the fashion is now the same, the music is the same, buildings look the same and food and drink is uniformly sold under the ubiquitous red banners of McDonalds and Coca-Cola. So called "Liberals" saw this as a positive move, preaching the merits of "diversity" whilst really sowing disharmony and homogeneity.</p>
<p>The fact is however that this homogeneity is now going one step further. I would argue that cultural, racial or religious differences are no longer relevant to the present and growing threat. It is no longer a question of whether you're this or that but it rests solely on the question of whether you're human or not. Keep in mind that this isn't a poor attempt at dehumanising political opponents. I mean it very literally.</p>
<p>The propaganda over COVID has shown that a large percentage of the population are incapable of independent thought. The NPC meme perfectly incapsulates this input-output of people's opinion but in truth propaganda is nothing new. The irony is that those who get so carried away what they're told by the media would have been the witch burners in medieval times, the card carrying National Socialists in Germany or radical Stalinists in 1930s Moscow. The critical difference however is that the propaganda is now beamed 24/7 into the device in your pocket and each and every one of the zealots becomes a mouthpiece for that same ideology through social media. </p>
<p>Propaganda and the NPC'ification of the public is just the tip of the iceberg however. With the looming threat of vaccine passports comes the real challenge for free humanity. Technology will soon enable a world of digital everything, where everything about you from medical records, what you think, what you buy and potentially what you <em>will</em> do, through predictive modelling, will conspire to have us kept as chattel to a corporate elite. </p>
<p>Coronavirus' arrival was nothing if not spectacular timing. It came just as 5G and superfast Internet  began being rolled out, just as the 4th Industrial Revolution began to threaten the majority of jobs, just as artificial intelligence began being deployed in policy making, just as international environmental legislation began being written, just as CRISPR and gene manipulation techniques had been developed and just as corporate Stakeholders who had captured the UN were talking about digital IDs. </p>
<p>Its not our freedom at stake, it's our humanity. So with that in mind I hope to convince you all that this is not something that is going away. This is something we need to push back on hard and indefinitely. Technology that we thought was convenient has become our masters and I think it's high time we accepted the fact that we need to get very serious about how deep this dive might go. If the Twitterati are going become radicalised big-tech and pharma supporters then we need to be more radically opposed to it all. Hence, we will need to build networks to do this, offline mainly, to make it happen. </p>

        <p>I managed to read it all! </p>
<p>But seriously, I'd just be happy with like, a link or something to let me know when the next protest in my state will be. Obviously not in the comments though, since that could be considered a call to action or something and get this sub taken down.</p>

        <p>I think blockchain technology could be useful as it inherently supports or leans towards decentralisation. Daaps etc. It can also be made to be totally anonymous (Bitcoin isn’t).</p>
<p>The NPC stuff….. it’s weird man. People spout shit they clearly have no idea about and when you probe them and give them information that is contrary to their ideology they go blank and the information goes in the ‘memoryhole’ never to be perused again. It’s like pick up a history book man, don’t you know who you sound like?</p>
