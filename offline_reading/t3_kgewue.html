    <strong>A comparison of the risk to others caused by driving a car VS the risk to others caused by not following lockdown rules when you don't have symptoms. Statistics showing clear hypocrisy.</strong>
    <p><p>The chance of someone who does not show symptoms causing the death or serious illness of an average of one other person by not following lockdown rules on any day: There are 250,000 covid cases weekly  and the virus persists usually at max. 2 weeks, so 500,000 people infected at any given time rn, so that is 0.152 % of all people. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3">The amount of asymptomatic carriers is around 17%.</a> So the chance of someone being part of the asymptomatic but covid-having group is 0.02584%. We assume that if someone of this group doesn't follow the lockdown rules strictly one person per day gets covid from this person. The fatality rate of covid is around 2.2%, but of course someone getting seriously ill is also not something we want and might take away someone's freedom for, so let's crank that number up to 12% (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html">hospitalization rate is around 10%</a>). So then the total chance of someone having covid, being asymptomatic, spreading it to an average of one person daily, and then covid endangering that other to such an extent that we want to remove freedoms from this individual is <strong>0.0031008%</strong>.</p>
<p>Is that worth taking away the most basic freedoms, causing financial problems, depression, loneliness, lacking education, etc. (for asymptomatic people)? (While also knowing that covid mainly kills people that would've died anyway within a year or so.)</p>
<p>To set it in perspective, (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/pedestrian_safety/index.html">2017 stats</a>) yearly 5,977 pedestrians were killed in the US and 137,000 needed medical treatment for car-crash related injuries (the equivalent to either dying from or being seriously ill from covid). An additional 23,866 people died as passengers in vehicle crashes, and (<a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/overview/introduction/">2018 stats</a>, 1.5027.. vehicles are involved in an average crash, around 4,500,000 'medically consulted injuries' and 3,9404 deaths when assuming there are an equal amount of people in all cars involved gives us:) 2,282,276 injuries or deaths to people in vehicles other than the drivers vehicle (so we exclude passenger injuries, which should also count but alas no data). Approximately 225,346,000 people had a license in 2017 in the US  so the chance of someone (who we allow the freedom of driving via a license) deciding to use a car and then killing or seriously injuring a pedestrian or other innocent person on any day (dividing the yearly stats by 365)(excluding the deaths and injuries or other serious issues it attributes via global warming and pollutants) is <strong>0.0092776.. %</strong>.</p>
<p>So 3 times higher than an action that causes covid transmission to an average of one person done by someone not showing symptoms, yet we allow people to drive cars (a freedom much less impactful, since there are alternatives and it's not necessary for our basic healthy survival and thriving, than the basic everyday social freedoms). So anybody who wants people (in the US) to have the freedom of driving a car while denying all asymptomatic(!) people the freedoms a lockdown prevents, because of the death or illness(/injury) they might cause others, is a hypocrite. QED.</p>
<p>And if the response of someone is "yes but the disease can spread further than direct contacts" then he/she is probably being weirdly specific consequentalistic on only this issue; indirect causes (of indirect causes of indirect causes, etc. of direct causes) have never mattered for the idea of moral responsibility most people have.</p></p>
