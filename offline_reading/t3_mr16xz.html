    <strong>Split the union</strong>
    <p><p>I'm honestly think everyone would be happier if we just moved the maskers to the left half of the country and the pro face group to the right side of the country and then just build a wall that way we can get back to business as usual and the left can also lift there lockdowns because let's not pretend this isn't political I know at least two mayors lifted lockdowns to celebrate January 20th when Trump left office.</p></p>

        <p>If only it was that easy. It wouldn‚Äôt be a clean geographical split (blue cities surrounded by red rural areas), and there are other unresolved issues like dividing the national debt. But part of the problem we‚Äôre seeing during the pandemic is the desire for control and power. It‚Äôs not enough for these people that their home states like New York and California are locked down. They need open states like Texas and Florida locked down too in order to keep people from realizing these restrictions are mostly useless.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say we were to split into two countries and the free side starts outperforming the masked/locked down side. There‚Äôs a surprisingly high chance the locked down side would use force to reunite the country in order to deflect from or vindicate their lockdowns.</p>

        <p>With the first idea we would need new states like the state of atlanta and the state of georgia for this to work essentially neither landmass would be united and that could create problems. With idea two where everyone moved to there side of the country why wouldn't we just fight them. Most of these lockdowns are enforced by numbers. I can't think of a scenario where the pro mask community is able to attack us with any chance of success without at least a 2 to 1 numbers advantage.</p>

        <p>If there was a clean way to do that, it would be my first choice.   The logistics would be difficult.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, if there were VOLUNTARY small trials of people making settlements elsewhere and they were satisfactory it could spread and become accepted more or less.  Communities  without restrictions, and communities committed to lockdown measures.  Or you could stay here (current state of affairs) and roll the dice longer with this shit show.</p>

        <p>Are we going to split by landmass proportional to population? Latest numbers I saw, 70% reported wearing masks every time they went out, and 80% said they intend to continue.  So you‚Äôd want everything west of the Rockies? Though since Republicans are far more likely to oppose mask usage (about half, compared to about 10% for Democrats and 30% for independents), shouldn‚Äôt the pro face group get the right? üòÑ</p>

        <p>One my post suggested the pro face anti mask community would get the right side of the country and two a lot of people only wear masks to avoid the government screwing with them in public. I was thinking  the divide would be from north Dakota to texas and we would draw the line after we know how many people wanted to be on each side. I think the numbers will be a even split for the most part.</p>

        <p>Maybe you forget that the red states depend on the blue states. We pay your taxes, we save your assess when it's gets too cold for you. </p>
<p>Liberals are just plain better than conservatives and if we split the union you'll always be jealous and covet what we have. That's why we can never let you go, you'll just declare open war over resources.</p>

        <p>It's cute that you are still talking about texas after a once in a decade storm but every year california has rolling blackouts. As far as taxes congratulations the government steals more of your money so instead of bitching about the salt tax exemption vote someone into office that will lower your taxes. Also texas again I know is a net tax paying state because I remember your group bitching about them trying to cut and run a couple of years ago.</p>
