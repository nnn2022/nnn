    <strong>Watched the Documentary "The Last Cruise" on HBO Max yesterday. My thoughts.</strong>
    <p><p>First off, I'm glad to be back, under a slightly different username.  I needed to be gone a bit, as everything Reddit-related was becoming toxic to my mental state.  I opted out, deleted, and took a breather.  </p>
<p>But, I came back, primarily to be here, but also in some sports subs, and r/tax, because I get and give a lot of information there.</p>
<p>Anyway, the documentary.  To give the shortest summary ever, the Princess Cruise was docked near Japan March '20, for well over a month, as so-called "positive cases" mounted.  Japanese authorities acted with the expected totalitarian methods, and couples and families on the cruise were separated based on test result.  A test that wasn't truly refined or perfected until much later, mind you.  Further, the staff of the cruise continued to stay aboard, tested or otherwise, in close quarters.  There were hundreds of so-called "positives", but very, very few fatal cases.  Just about the less than 1% number we all know to be accurate.  </p>
<p>Bottom line is that staff on the cruise ship, over 1,000 of them, were treated as less than human, by being asked to remain on the cruise ship and do their work, with little in the way of quarantining the way that guests were required.  It showed me, clearly, that the rules are for those who will conform to them, or for those NOT NEEDED.  If you are a worker bee, someone who's job is important enough to threaten the viability of an operation, you would be asked to continue close to normal.</p>
<p>My end thought is this: evacuating the cruise ship, if they thought it truly necessary, should have been the first order of business.  It was either poor crisis management, or outright negligence, and it should be seen as such.  Further, when the virus began to show itself in other places, their actions went far and above those shown on this cruise ship.  Too far and above.  And, yet, here we are, a year later.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.  Sorry if my synopsis sucks.</p></p>
