    <strong>African-American singer, Tommy Vext, ostracized and forced to leave his band for daring to question lock-downs and BLM protests.</strong>

<p>I recently discovered the band Bad Wolves because of their cover of the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaS93WMRQQ">Zombie</a>. The performance was dedicated to the memory of The Cranberries' lead singer Dolores O'Riordan, who died in 2018. In the video linked above, former Bad Wolves lead singer, Tommy Vext, explains how he was personally attacked and ridiculed for his beliefs.</p>
<p>Tommy's crime was asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is happening to the country that I love?</li>
<li>Who financially benefited from, and who was funding BLM protests?</li>
<li>During lockdown, why were small businesses driven into bankruptcy while big chains were allowed to operate?</li>
<li>Why social distancing, while rioting and looting are exempt?</li>
<li>Why can't we have family gatherings, unless you're a politician?</li>
</ul>
<p>As he puts it, "I became unacceptable to the gatekeepers because I walked off the plantation."</p></p>
