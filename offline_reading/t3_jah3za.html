    <strong>What happened to everyone saying the world is overpopulated?</strong>
    <p><p>I remember pre-COVID, all anyone my age could talk about is how we’re overpopulated and we need to stop having children. I disagree. Anyways, it seems all that has gone out the window. According to these borderline eugenists, shouldn’t we be glad this is happening? It’s lowering the population and killing the younger people who shouldn’t reproduce, right? </p>
<p>I don’t know man, this just pisses me off. I remember everyone saying they hate boomers and how this will be the “boomer remover.” Obviously joking about it doesn’t mean they want old people dead, but it just rubs me the wrong way when people suddenly care. It’s just people bouncing between the opinions that they think makes them cool. </p>
<p>It’s so hard to convey how frustrated and tired I am with all of this. I’m moving away from my Left Coast area to a cabin in Montana where I can have my little Catholic family with my husband. Honestly I don’t know if I ever want friends my age again. It’s too draining and tiring.</p></p>

<p>Yeah. Uh. This is how the majority of people are. They'll cling to an ideology or some other school of thought, and basically worship it, and parrot what the others who also worship what they worship say and believe. Sometimes that might go against a personal belief, but often, people will discard their own beliefs and opinions to follow the crowd.</p>

        <p>I don't know about Montana but you can certainly make a better life in many places. Cabin in the Ozarks is just as good and probably a lot cheaper especially with less harsh winters.</p>
<p>I'd invite you to New Hampshire but we are completely full at the moment, it's impossible to buy a house or suitable land for building unless you make an offer way over list price within hours of it hitting the market. Though there's a 12,000 sqft house on 50 acres of land for sale in my town now, $800k or so, but we are one of the highest tax towns and nobody that rich is dumb enough to move to a town with such high taxes. They'd buy land somewhere else and build their custom home not someone else's used one. So it will sit for months.</p>

        <p>Well, it’s set and done we’re moving onto my in-laws ranch so my husband can work. I’d really look into somewhere different but we’re getting a cabin and employment. I’m pregnant so I really need a place to live since my lease is almost up. Yeah, the winters will be harsh and I’m worried about how my husband will hold up because he’s half black and Australian.</p>
