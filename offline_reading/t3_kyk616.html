        <p>I didn't put a lockdown on my poll because it was proven to be working a hundred years ago, and we still get proof every day. Did you know that more than half of the terrible diseases we had in the last hundred years (the black death for instance) were destroyed with... Drumrolls  please... A lockdown :)</p>

<p>This is by no means comparable to the black death you are being naive even saying that I assume you support these lockdowns even though people are starving and small businesses are being shafted right...</p>

        <p>Yup, a virus with a 0.03% mortality rate (and that includes people over 70 years old) is comparable to the black death.  Do you go out of your way to be ignorant and  just watch fear porn?</p>

        <p>Just like any other sub anything found here should have its sources checked.</p>
<p>The reason people like this sub is because it is one of the few subunits that has a modicum of free speech left a lot of sub censorin any dissenting opinions or controversial discussions about these topics and that is not right.</p>
<p>It's also not right that your post here is generalizing and implying that all the posts on this sub are stupid post range from people venting people sharing articles people making graphs from government statistics to memes...</p>
<p>Obviously you have a very nonobjective and heavily biased mentality towards this topic so you can only see the posts that make this sub look bad but personally I would rather have those posts and give everyone the opportunity to share their opinions then have this sub divulge into another heavily moderated and curated sub like 99% of Reddit</p>

        <p>Hi, I have had covid and spent two weeks in the ER. I don't get my information fron reddit or any other social media, but actually do my research. While in the ER I spent a lot of time on actual trustable sites like the dutch RIVM. I also looked at a lot of research reports, some of them proving masks/lockdowns don't work. I strave for oblectivity, but calling me biased os kind of weird since you know nothing about me.</p>

        <p>Okay I am sorry for jumping the gun, the way you comment is more objective than the way you titled this post would have lt me to believe I'm glad that you found resources that pointed the hypocrisy in mask/lockdowns, etc a lot of people just think its misinformation when in reality it deserves just as much of a spotlight as anything else</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you had to go to the ER for this my father had it and I took care of him at home we wasokay but pretty grumpy</p>
<p>Also, The ER must have been terrible if you tried to commit suicide twice. I have never tried it but I have had some dark times and bad thoughts but I have come to the conclusion that suicide only hurts the people that love you so it is really not worth it, and even if you think nobody loves you the majority of people in life love their fellow man at least I would like to believe that, might be a little optimistic. </p>
<p>Regardless, I hope you are feeling better mentally I know easier said than done.</p>

        <p>I posted that to spread positivity, and made a lot of new friends after posting that. All I want is for others to be happy. And there are a lot of unhappy people in the world right now, afraid of dying from a disease. I don't like posting about the bad things in life, not because I'm lying, but because I don't want to spread negativity.</p>

        <p>I understand that sometimes a person might lie about their own Covid experiences because they think it's "for the best" if other people "see" how many people have been affected.</p>
<p>Do you think a lot of people do that?</p>
<p>Because I can tell you that it is really common for me to see some outrageous story about Covid like "Yes my mother and father and aunt and uncle all died from Covid" and then I look at their comment history and there is not a single previous mention of it.</p>
<p>Wouldnt it be funny if most of the stories you see were just people like you, coming up with fake stories to try to get others to "Do the right thing"?</p>

<p>You, of all people, should understand how mental health issues and suicides are directly correlated with all these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
<p>So it sounds like your true issues lie with the governments.</p>

        <p>“Show results” Lol. Yeah show us the results of mandates and lockdowns. Newsweek just said they didn’t make a difference. Cuomo and Lightfoot just said everything needs to open back up. The results show that counties without mask mandates tend to have similar or LESS cases per-capita than places that do. So yes, fucking show results!</p>

        <p>Apples and oranges. The bubonic plague killed half the people it infected hence the extreme measures taken. </p>
<p>Covid kills .4% of the infected according to the CDC. Not even close to black plague levels. This is why a growing number of the population is seeing lockdowns for Covid as extreme.</p>
<p>I think you will find that most people here do not deny there is an actual virus causing many people health issues and some deaths. Many of us have actually had it as well. </p>
<p>This sub is more or less an advocate for the people that have been affected negatively by lock downs and masks. One example, how do deaf people read lips with everyone wearing masks? None of the "maskers" seem worried about them. I could go on with more examples but this is long enough already.</p>
