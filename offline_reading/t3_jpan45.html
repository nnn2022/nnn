    <strong>Why does the doomers forget that their beloved governments, experts and media ignored and downplayed this virus for 3 months???</strong>
    <p><p>Remember January, Remember February? </p>
<p>Remember how the media said that this virus was just a flu, how they found experts that said the same. Politicians that refused to shutdown China borders because "Muh Economy" saying that the west could handle this much better.</p>
<p>Remember how they said closing borders have no effects and is racist? Remember when they said China measures were too extreme and against human rights?</p>
<p>These monsters blame people for enjoying the few hours of being free after a whole week of working and there is just something dystopian about that (Coronavirus can for some virus not infect essential workers, but can for some reason infect people who have fun)</p>
<p>How can they blame people for spreading this virus when they didn't blame their own governments.</p>
<p>If we put effort in back in January and February maybe we wouldn't have been in such a bad situation as we are now.</p>
<p>They screwed up, can we please return to normal.</p>
<p>The goal is to avoid war, but if the enemy storms your borders and strikes your people, do you just surrender because that would make even more casualties?</p>
<p>No because the goal for no war failed, so you fight.</p>
<p>Our equivalent of that would be to not let this virus rule society.</p></p>

        <p>Anyone remember a picture that was posted on /r/pics back in february of some guy grocery shopping in a n95 mask, goggles and gloves calling him a paranoid doomsday prepper who just come out of his bunker? It gained thousands of likes and awards.</p>
<p>Months of propaganda later...and here we are. It's remarkable.</p>

        <p>I was chastised pretty hard because I folowed it in January, late December even as China was taking measures. No one gave a shit or paid any mind to what at that time did seem like anyones guess. Couldve been the next black death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Media just turned a switch and said OK NOW ITS HERE. NO, JUST THE EAST COAST, YOURE FINE. OK NOW YOURE NOT FINE. OK NO ONES FINE NOW. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With the information we have now I would have ignored it too. Its the opposite of when people should have/should be panicked. It is beyond frustrating.</p>

        <p>I was following it via the Japanese news. They took it much more seriously at the start than the west. But unlike the west Asia is dealing with epidemics and pandemics much more often. </p>
<p>Funny how fast our politicians decided they could use this against us.</p>

        <p>I really relate to this frustration. I was also much more concerned than the average person early on, and now in some sense am less. Some people might say it's ironic that I've changed my mind so much, but to me it's always been more a matter of looking at what we do and don't know and acting accordingly.</p>

        <p>It's comical too since the virus literally hit the very hardest (especially since it was literally massively spreading while undetected around that time!!) At the beginning and yet people panic more and more as the health effects become fewer</p>

        <p>Lmao it’s not the media’s job to handle a pandemic.</p>
<p>The media didn’t decide to dismantle the pandemic prep team. That was the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The media didn’t decide to go golfing in February instead of planning for a pandemic. That was Trump.</p>
<p>The media didn’t decide to not instate a country wide mask mandate and not organize lockdown protocols before things got out of hand. Or to not listen to medical experts. Or to not even be present at coronavirus task force meetings anymore. All that’s Trump.</p>

        <p>I’m no defender of Trump, and he definitely mishandled the pandemic response. However, it’s a simple fact that while the media was covering Trump’s impeachment, COVID was spreading throughout the US and Europe, which in hindsight was not the more important of the two stories to focus on.</p>

        <p>Yeah... if you were “following” the virus at all, you were using media. Political journalists follow politics btw, Not world events (which it was at the time). Coronavirus was being reported on, but they didn’t have all the information because china, and then the United states hid or ignored information.</p>
<p>The us media trusted the president and his administration to handle it and warn us according to the severity here in the USA, like all of us did.  So when the president downplayed the virus they were under the belief that it was not serious yet.</p>

        <p>Ya know Trump knew early January and guess what, he said nothing, he went golfing. Over and over he laughed and called it a hoax, nothing to see here, for months!! Let's imagine The Leader of the free world in early January coming to literally ANY media podium and said "Coronavirus is real, it's coming, we need to deal with it. It's killing people. We need a mask mandate, and a lockdown as we learn how to proceed based on decades of science." </p>
<p>What would the media have done then? Yep covered it. So stop it, he messed up, the media covered literally every word Trump has said on 30 years and he didn't say anything substantial that his chronies would understand.</p>

        <p>We wouldn't be in this mess if not for the psychotic reaction to a 0.2% IFR virus and these dumbasses were actually listening to the real science that has shown what this virus really is since January. They were right to not be concerned in January...because that was the sane and normal response to a mild respiratory virus. But something happened in March...a mass psychosis, a complete break with all reason and logic, a massive Orwellian reprogramming of an already dumb, weak-minded, and gullible population. Remember that everything that we see today, all the insanity, the immense damage and wanton destruction, this entire hellish waking nightmare...none of this was causes by this weak virus. All of it was caused by society's absolutely idiotic, psychotic, disgusting reaction to it.</p>

        <p>How is that analysis? I hate the situation we're in as much as anyone but it's like no one on this subreddit wants to talk about how hospitals were running out of capacity for all the people in intensive care. It's something that's starting to happen again with the new wave of infections.</p>

        <p>Precisely!</p>
<p>Let us not forget that the people such as Fauci as being our Global  scientific advisor and savior, actually spoke the truth about the effectiveness of masks, and that they only serve as a psychological security blanket, not as a means to stop the spread. This was spoken by Fauci based on decades of pre 2020 science and then..the... flip..and not one of the sheep questioned it..Already were they programmed to recall only what they are told to recall, recite only what they are told to recite and believe only what they are told to believe. They are now openly and blatantly changing the "Facts" and "Science" day to day and people still do not question. To me this is them laughing and mocking at how well they have succeeded at brainwashing us. They can tell us anything one minute and contradict it the next, and people still line up hinging on their next command...I knew we as humans are impressionable  but this is beyond anything i could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>Just curious, have you ever engaged in a debate and after you demonstrate how their "facts" are "fallacy" based on real evidence and science, they begin to go blank and either drift back into their wonderland, or they respond as their final argument with heightened hostility stating that "if you think that they could get away with something like this you're just a moron" and then storm off..lol</p>

        <p>Every single time I've ever tried to talk to one of the followers of this viral cult, it is always the same. I mentioned it here before, it feels like talking to the exact same person. They just keep mindlessly regurgitating the NPC programming. The same mantras, the same bullshit points. And the always say things like how they're listening to the "experts" and their "science". When confronted with the tons of data and information that completely obliterates the narrative they so blindly believe in, it's always the same as well. They ignore all of it, then they become hostile and start the stupid insults of "nutjob, conspiracy theorist, science-denier alt-right lunatic", yada yada yada. It usually ends with them wishing ventilation and death from covid upon me or my family.</p>

        <p>People forgot because the media memory holed how the Democrats wasted three months whining about corona racism and telling people to hug a Chinese person, and then spent months churning out content about how Trump downplayed the virus. Propaganda works.</p>

        <p>Never believe the government. At the beginning, when they were downplaying it, was the only time it made sense to be scared. From April onward they went into total crazy mode with the fearmongering...anyone who was still afraid of the virus past that point can't possibly be turned back now.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/17/new-coronavirus-what-dont-we-know-dr-anthony-fauci-q-a-opinion/4790996002/">This interview with Dr. Fauci from February</a> is worth a read.  Of notable interest:</p>
<p>&rt;The mortality rate of seasonal flu is about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most. If you look at the new coronavirus, and you do the math, it's sticking right at 2%. <strong>But (the actual rate could be much lower) because there are many, many either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic people (in China) that don't get counted in the denominator.</strong></p>
<p>...
&rt;  <strong>In respiratory-borne illnesses, the driver of outbreaks are usually the people who have symptoms.</strong> I'm sick. I'm in the subway. I sneeze on you. I cough on you. There is asymptomatic transmission in other infections. The extent to which that is impacting the coronavirus epidemic, we don't know. But we're having early case reports which are now making it pretty clear that some degree of asymptomatic transmission occurs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; Q. Who is at greatest risk?</p>
<p>&rt;A. <strong>It's almost identical to what we're seeing with influenza.</strong> If you're elderly, have chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, obesity — all of that makes you much more likely to have complications, if not death.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;Q. That would never happen here, would it? Locking down 50 million people?</p>
<p>&rt;A. No, not a chance. It would never happen.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;Q. Is the seasonal flu a bigger concern?</p>
<p>&rt;A. We are right now in the middle of an influenza outbreak, which is having its second wave. We have more kids dying of flu this year, at this time, than in the last decade or more. Then it went down, and now we're having a second wave of H1N1 flu again, which is particularly serious in children. So right now, at the same time people are worrying about going to a Chinese restaurant, the threat is that what we have in this country, we're having a pretty bad influenza season, particularly dangerous for our children.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;A mask is much more appropriate for someone who is infected and you're trying to prevent them from infecting other people than it is in protecting you against infection. If you look at the masks that you buy in a drug store, the leakage around that doesn't really do much to protect you. And for example, people start saying, should I start wearing a mask? Now, in the United States, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Fauci and the media ABSOLUTELY did a hard 180, sometime in March.  It's crazy to think that this is the same guy who is now saying it'll take us multiple years to resume any semblance of normalcy, we can't see family for the holidays, and we must wear masks 24/7.</p>
