        <p>With all of the information that has basically been saying this has been blown way out of portion And people are still going crazy over this it’s just ridiculous! I can honestly only hope that after the election shit will get back to normal. If not then I guess I have no hope. Because if it’s not political I’d have no explanation for why people are still acting the way that they are.</p>

        <p>Ok, it sounds like there is nothing to be done. I mean, there’s too few of us that aren’t brainwashed, so we cannot be an effective opposition. </p>
<p>So What do we do with our lives now? </p>
<p>How do we find a way to be content when so many things we’ve loved about life are all gone and never coming back?  </p>
<p>What are your plans and ideas for yourself? What suggestions can you give me and others?</p>

        <p>I would suggest leave the country, but that wouldn't work since eventually you'll run out of places to run to. If a revolution/civil war/whatever does happen, make sure you're prepped for it and have plenty of ammo. Try to find communities and/or homestead if you can.</p>
<p>If nothing happens, it's still a good idea to be prepared.</p>

        <p>Try and get financial independence and then move out to the countryside in a smaller country that is less likely to be the focal point.  Try and be as 'off grid' as possible. It'll be a long time before anyone bothers you. At least, that's what I'm trying to do and I asked myself the same question you just asked.</p>

        <p>That’s not the case for me, I believe there is a bunch of people who believe in the same values as me. I see where you’re coming from though, I would be upset if nobody in my country shared the same values as me. If that were the case I wouldn’t be loyal to my country either.</p>

        <p>It's completely political but not in the sense of the presidential election. If Biden gets into office it'll be much faster than it has been already but even if Trump keeps office they'll continue trying. It isn't about the presidency, it's about total control and power.</p>
<p>I am almost certain there will be an outright revolution on US soil sooner than later...and ammo/gun sales reflect that fear from others.
Of course I hope I'm wrong.</p>

<p>Guess what? Nothing is returning to normal. The election has nothing to do with this, this is a global takeover. All of this is permanent. Downvote me all you want, call me a doomer/reverse doomer, you know I'm right. You're just in denial and don't want to accept the upcoming future of worldwide mass surveillance, tracking, immunity passports/COVID passes/Digital IDs and digital currency.</p>
