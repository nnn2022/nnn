        <p>I liked seeing her on fox, but some of this is a bit of a stretch:</p>
<p>&rt; Step Eight is to control the press. Pres. Trump has called the press an “enemy of the people” – notably, a Stalinist term, used against Nikolai Bukharin in the 1938 show trial that led to his execution.</p>
<p>&rt; President Trump, as we know, assails news outlets as “Fake News” and attains control by such distortions of fact that the press cannot do its traditional job effectively at all, as readers can no longer tell truth from fiction; this is a methodology used by Soviet and now Russian propagandists as well to invalidate the news media.</p>
<p>So, in order to control the press, Trump lashed out at them constantly and was in turn attacked?  This reads more like TDS, not the brilliant strategy of Trump to use the press against the people.  They acted in that role against the wishes of the President, and do so now, unchanged, aligned with the current administration.</p>
<p>No, a better example is the current white house admin working hand in hand with facebook and twitter to suppress dissent.  THAT is an example of government-controlled media, and is terrifying.  </p>
<p>She wants to blame Trump for the authoritarian tyranny, instead of the democratic governors, and now Biden, who are the ones actively taking away our rights.</p>

        <p>She originally wrote this list back in the early 2000's when she was going after Bushy, then a little bit under Barry... she wrote this update in September 2020 (while in TDS mode) and should update it with the new normal of the Press &amp; Big Tech in bed with gubbermint.</p>
<p>The Amazing thing with her tweets and Tucker is that she now recognizes that The Totalitarian STATE is here and her political affiliation is (D)</p>

        <p>Ah, thank you for the history.  I hadn't even heard of her until the fox interview and this post.</p>
<p>Watching the presidents' labels (R/D) swap back and forth and recognizing how little changes is eye opening, and it's great that she is noticing, outspoken, and hopefully will bring some more Ds with her to the discussion.  Or they'll excommunicate her like they do with other heretics.</p>

        <p>She is a radical left Feminist, here is one of her original posts from 2007- You can see her bend... but I find it amazing that she went on Tucker (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/24/usa.comment)</p>

        <p>Before 2020, I didn't realize how f'ed up the press was. I'm glad I finally woke up or was it really not this bad in previous years?</p>

        <p>Hard to say? It feels like a steady decline over years, but age also plays in to our assessment of things, and prising those apart is challenging at best.</p>

        <p>This is really well thought out. Good article. Makes it clear that we really are all of one step away from becoming the exact tyrannical shit heads we were taught to hate in school... </p>
<p>Stopping groups gathering truly hinders our ability to collaborate and control what is being done to us by our 'elected officials,' and 'experts,' (read self appointed monarchs) </p>
