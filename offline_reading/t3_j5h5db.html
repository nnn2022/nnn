    <strong>Amy Coney Barrett upheld Illinois Governor Pritzker's lockdown decree and she did it using a Supreme Court decision which upheld forced vaccinations - "Jacobson v. Massachusetts".</strong>
    <p><p>Illinois state Representative, Darren Bailey (Republican) sued Illinois Governor JB Pritzker (Democrat) arguing that his Constitutionally protected rights were being violated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wcia.com/news/capitol-news/judge-puts-pritzkers-unconstitutional-executive-order-in-legal-limbo/">Judge Michael McHaney agreed</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;Judge McHaney: “<strong>Every second this Executive Order is in existence, it is in violation of the Constitution and shreds the Bill of Rights.”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pritzker appealed the decision until it reached the Seventh Circuit where the lockdown decree was upheld.</p>
<p>Amy Coney Barrett would rule on this case, along with another Trump appointee, Amy J. St. Eve, and one Clinton Appointee, Diane Wood.   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/04/illinois-coronavirus-lockdown-court-challenge-408747">Court rejects Illinois GOP's challenge to governor's lockdown order</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is their decision:</p>
<p><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/20-2175/20-2175-2020-09-03.html#">Illinois Republican Party v. J. B. Pritzker, No. 20-2175 (7th Cir. 2020)</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;The Illinois Republican Party and some of its affiliates (“the Republicans”) believe that the accommodation for free exercise contained in the executive order violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. </p>
<p>&rt;In this action, they seek a permanent injunction against EO43. </p>
<p>&rt;In so doing, they assume that such an injunction would permit them, too, to congregate in groups larger than 50, rather than reinstate the stricter ban for religion that some of the Governor’s earlier executive orders included, though that is far from assured. </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Relying principally on Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905)</strong>, the district court denied the Republicans’ request for preliminary injunctive relief against EO43. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts">Jacobson v. Massachusetts</a></p>
<p>&rt;Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. </p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The Court's decision articulated the view that individual liberty is not absolute and is subject to the police power of the state.</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is so much wrong here, no additional commentary required.</p></p>
