    <strong>No medical liability, a rush to market, trial steps skipped, laws changed to facilitate, no full release of data, no MSM discussion or debate. Is this really how they’re hoping to persuade the public to take their mRNA vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>“With the first COVID-19 vaccines already approved in the U.K. and almost ready to roll out, the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care has indemnified Pfizer of any liability, if someone were to be injured by the vaccine.</p>
<p>Independent reported that U.K. ministers have been busy the past few weeks changing laws so Pfizer and the other vaccine companies can’t be sued by patients who are harmed, or by families whose members might die from complications due to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Brits don’t need to even consider suing health staff or anyone else who delivers or works with the vaccine, either, because they, too, are now protected against any liability for harm. In a press conference, Pfizer’s managing director “refused to explain why the company needed an indemnity,” Independent reported. </p>
<p>Pfizer also refused to say when full data from the vaccine’s clinical trials would be published.”</p>
<p>With no liability for damage, no long term studies, and without a full release of the existing Pfizer study data, are we expected to simply take their word for the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness? No wonder more than half of us are reticent or reluctant at best...</p>

        <p>No, it's not. Ireland figured out over 50% of the population wouldn't take the vaccine so you know what they just did? Made it so elderly care home residents get one "vaccine buddy", and that vaccinated person is the only one who'll be able to visit grandma. Don't forget Australia saying they're tying the vaccine to social welfare payments, and many countries in Europe already developing vaccination passports. They don't actually care whether you want to take this vaccine, so they're not going to waste their time talking it up to convince you. You'll get it if you want to participate in society, otherwise, you can stay locked down forever. </p>
<p>Yet when all of this was brought up in March, we were all considered conspiracy theorists and it would never happen.</p>

        <p>The Mercola website can't be trusted, but I don't trust the speed of this vaccine either. Especially how effective it's supposed to be. Even influenza vaccines aren't 90% effective!</p>

        <p>I don't know, man...</p>
<p>With "right wing" media like FOX &amp; Sky News openly reporting on "The Great Reset", I'm starting to wonder if social unrest isn't exactly what they want.</p>
<p>Maybe they want people to resist and stand up in large numbers so they can bring in the army and declare martial law.</p>
<p>I know this sounds crazy. But I can't believe the powers that be are so incompetent they keep messing things up so blatantly!</p>

<p>They are incompetent dude. It's a mistake to assume they're invincible, they're just people at the end of the day. More than anything else I feel this is a test to see just how far they can push us. It's an experiment to see how many rights of ours they can take away and they'll take as many as they can. In the past our governments and media institutions would wage wars on foreign countries with our consent, now they are waging war on us, again trying to use our consent. They're pushing too hard and I promise they will not get away with it. They're playing an extremely dangerous game and it's not going to end well for them if they keep this up as we've seen countless times throughout history. </p>
<p>The government is already dialing things back in the UK. We recently had an anti-lockdown protest in London and the way the police behaved was disgusting. It was on camera for the entire nation to see and people are pissed off. Yesterday there was an anti-lockdown protest in Birmingham and there was no police presence whatsoever, whereas in London they physically assaulted and arrested over 150 people. Resistance is also building amongst MPs, the writing is on the wall. I really don't see this government being able to keep this up beyond March. And I don't see them being able to coerce people into taking the vaccine either.</p>

<p>Invincible? I don't think so.</p>
<p>Still, though, the people pushing this "pandemic" narrative are making to many "mistake" and are <a href="https://johnslegers.medium.com/connecting-the-dots-between-covid-19-and-the-not-so-great-reset-798e8ba7d95">so blatant about their "great reset" agenda</a> that it begs the question whether or not there's some "5D chess" going on.</p>
<p>Remember : the people behing this "pandemic" have been planning this for years.</p>
