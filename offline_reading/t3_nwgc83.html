    <strong>Why Joe Biden Is The Fall Guy</strong>
    <p><p>In Professional Wrestling, there is a "heel", which is basically the bad guy who wears black, who everyone loves to hate.  </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)</p>
<p>Noteworthy: much respect for Sputnik Monroe for using his heel position to advance civil rights. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_Monroe_(wrestler)</p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6507972</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 1980's there was a TV show called <em>The Fall Guy</em>. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_Guy</p>
<p>2 minute video of <em>The Fall Guy</em> TV show intro. </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmIsMzyohqM</p>
<hr>
<p>In the 2016 election there was <em>The Pied Piper Strategy</em></p>
<p>How the Hillary Clinton campaign deliberately "elevated" Donald Trump with its "pied piper" strategy</p>
<p>https://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/ </p>
<hr>
<p>Basically, the piped piper strategy was Hillary Clinton's plan to elevate Donald Trump as a "heel", as the personification and embodiment of everything that is wrong with America. </p>
<p>Trump is... old, white, male, wealthy, racist, xenophobic, sexist, capitalist, etc...</p>
<p>And Hillary Clinton was supposed to be the the opposite of all that. </p>
<p>And on election night 2016, just enough voters rejected the establishments hand-picked candidate, and went with the pied piper heel instead. </p>
<p>She was not supposed to lose. Oops. </p>
<p>And the left went ballistic, and never really recovered mentally. Their carefully constructed faux-reality had been shattered, and they were faced with the prospect of 8 years of Trump, who represents everything that is wrong with America.</p>
<p>So, the deep state establishment concocted a fake COVID pandemic (Event 201), as pretext for many things, not the least of which would be mail-in ballots, in order to steal the 2020 election from the voters.  </p>
<p>But then something very strange happened...</p>
<p>"The left" went with, Joe Biden... who was old, white, male, wealthy, racist, xenophobic, sexist, capitalist, etc...</p>
<p>But why Joe Biden (D), of all people? Joe Biden represents everything they hate about Donald Trump, but now with a "D" behind his name?</p>
<p>Same shit, different packaging? </p>
<p>Joe Biden is very old, and senile, and probably not fit to serve for 2 terms. </p>
<p>Or is he? ...</p>
<p>I have been quite puzzled at how Joe Biden has been treated after the election, by the same media that had just propped up his warm carcass throughout the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The media has been somewhat inexplicably critical of their boy, and I couldn't quite figure out why, but then it occurred to me...</p>
<p>Joe Biden is just another heel. The guy you love to hate. </p>
<p>They know Joe Biden isn't going to be a 2 term President, but the deep state doesn't care. They just needed someone, anyone to replace Trump, who was off the chain, out of control, and running roughshod over their agenda.</p>
<p>But as for ordinary voters, a candidates health has always been a major issue. Fitness for office. </p>
<p>Remember when Obama and McCain went at it, and Obama had a 1 page medical record, and McCain had a file cabinet for a medical record, and everyone thought that was just so funny at the time, because we knew that meant Obama was going to win. I was an Obama supporter at the time, so this pleased me.</p>
<p>So here we have ordinary Democrat voters, being stuck with Joe Biden, the heel, who isn't even healthy enough to serve a full 8 years?</p>
<p>But that matters not, to the deep state, who just need Joe Biden to play the role of heel long enough to get Trump out, and anyone loyal to the deep state in. </p>
<p>So currently, Joe Biden is kinda playing the heel role that they thought Donald Trump would play. </p>
<p>Joe Biden is just role playing. He's a stunt man. The Fall Guy. </p>
<p>That way, when the shit hits the fan, the deep state gets to blame...</p>
<p>... old, white, male, wealthy, racist, xenophobic, sexist, capitalist, etc...</p>
<p>And Kamala Harris is perfectly positioned as VP to be the opposite of all that, just like Hillary Clinton was.</p>
<p>Why else would Joe Biden announce that his VP would be a "Woman Of Color" first, and then find a candidate that had that merit-qualification later?</p>
<hr>
<p>And all of this occurred to me while i was watching the following video, by Paul Joseph Watson. </p>
<p>Just watch Joe Biden in these clips, and see if he's not just another heel, and he knows he being set up to take the big fall...</p>

        <p>That’s an interesting theory, but the reason then put Biden in goes a lot deeper than that. They needed their own in power for <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Trump was an anomaly not because he was the heel but because he’s one of the only billionaires in the world who can’t be conclusively tied to the WEF, Club of Rome, Bilderberg group, or similar organizations.</p>

        <p>It’s on YouTube, and the presenter talks pretty slow, so you can put it on 2x speed. To be honest, though, you wouldn’t be wasting your time even if you did just watch it as is. The presenter actually uses articles from conventional news sources and reputable organizations to make his point, and he does not extrapolate and add his own opinion. Ice Age Farmer is a pretty unbiased journalist.</p>
<p>At the very least, you’d learn what we “conspiracy theorists” say, so you’d have an actually logical rebuttal next time you see someone post on this.</p>

        <p>No, you made up a conspiracy theory about how Joe Biden is a “heel”; it’s a complete work of fiction. 9-11 has nothing to do with this conversation.</p>

        <p>remember all that "hope and change" Obama promised on the campaign trail in 2008... </p>
<p>and then the swamp installed Joe Biden as VP, </p>
<p>just in case they needed to JFK BHO...</p>
<p>thats how long i've known Joe Biden is just another deep state role player. </p>

        <p>were you politically aware in 2008?</p>
<p>every Obama supporter, myself included, groaned when that shit-bag Biden was made VP, and we didn't have any say in the matter.</p>
<p>we were supporting Obama to get away from shitbags like Biden. </p>
<p>Biden was already a presidential candidate several times, and every time he ran, the voters rejected his creepy, girl-sniffing ass</p>

        <p>Not all Obama voters voted for the same reasons as you, or interpreted the elections in the same way. Biden as VP was widely seen as pandering to the center, and to white voters.</p>

        <p>LOL, yes, pandering to the center. A white, tough-on-crime Democrat from rural Pennsylvania to quell any fears of voting for someone of color. That’s exactly what he was on the ticket for, and it’s extremely well documented. </p>
<p>And on his electability, I think the last election says enough 😂</p>
