    <strong>I'm done with this Shit</strong>
    <p><p>Fuck vaccine mandates in my country I can't go to the gym I can't go to a barber shop for even a trim, i can't enjoy a meal inside a restaurant nor going to a mall just for a change of scenery even though I've caught covid and I didn't feel a thing I was just locked inside my room playing videogames and watching Netflix for 10 days (it was okay at first but it got boring quick) by then I realized that I am nothing but statistic for them, so why bother at all what's the big deal? But right now the government isn't the one that I'm really annoyed with it's the mask wearing sheeple that just accept anything given with no question asked policy like think for yourselves dammit is slavery to someone's else agenda that easy research the risks that your taking, stand your ground why are you afraid you eat all sort of crap you barely exercise for your health sometimes lacking proper hygiene yet you are afraid of 2.5% risk of death from some new named flu I couldn't care less about it and being forced in an undirect way to take it by being denied access to the gym or traveling , other than my job (they tried implementing vaccine mandates but thanks to the labour union at the company for taking a stand they stopped ) but that still won't stop them I accepted it is inevitable luckily I am preparing myself just incase it happens because they can shove those vaccines up their ass for all I care because I prefer to starve then being a  slave. I am refusing every vaccine even if I'm being shamed or attacked I'm standing by my choice because I'm done being patient. being told I'm not allowed to go inside and people looking at me like I'm some sort of maniac for even thinking of going inside and enjoy myself it feels humiliating its like I'm not human, like fuck this I reached my limit I couldn't care less about this bullshit they can burn while defending it for all I care.</p>
<p>Tldr: I ran out of patience for the sheeple that obey every lie and defend it regardless of how unreasonable or unfair it sounds they can throw themselves in a ditch for all I care.</p>
<p>Ps: I am glad that there are some people out there who had enough of this bullshit and are seeing through it so there is some hope left.</p></p>

        <p>Do everything possible to continue on, you may have to move to 'freer' areas.. Most likely smaller or rural towns, where they respect people's rights more, and have more space to do it in.</p>
<p>If it gets to the point where you will die due to unfair restrictions on your livelihood, so that you can no longer access food, medicine, or essential services.. there's only one thing left to do.</p>

        <p>Jeez.. Wishing you strength and guidance, that is some heavy stuff you've summed up there. I agree with you, I also am so very tired of the people that quietly obey every order they get.. that there isn't any form of critical thinking. Here in the Netherland is the main discussion that people take the jab because "thEy wANt to gO oN vACatiOn' .. but the concept of WHY there is such a thing as a 'vacation' is something that doesn't cross their minds,life to most of them is just "do this do that" 'till you die. It's so fucking sad..</p>
