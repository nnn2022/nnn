    <strong>Is it naïve to be feeling optimistic about there being way less mask wearing by the end of July?</strong>
    <p><p>I just have a feeling a lot of people will be dropping their masks by the end of July. Not only would it have been a couple of months that everyone had the opportunity to get vaccinated, but July is normally one of the hottest months of the year. I doubt people will be wearing their masks in the heat, but of course there might be a small amount of people who will. The only question is will the media and CDC use the winter to keep establishing fear to wear masks when the weather will go back to being cold again.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with you. Majority of people are done with it. I’m in the only state with a mandate still and I’ve seen delivery people and workers with masks below their nose or totally down until they see a customer with one on come up to them. Nobody wants to do this anymore, and it’s only a matter of time before it’s phased out as the “correct” thing to do in polite society. It was never about covid. It was about following trends and shaming people for not complying. And trends change.</p>

        <p>I would bet you money, actual money, that they will start a new fear campaign when fall is about the end. Just about the time that the vaccinated start dying from exposure to wild type covid and they start calling it a dangerous and deadly mutation. This will never go away. They don't want it to go away, they need to keep it around.</p>

        <p>A growing number of people have the attitude that it's pretty much over. I feel that number could reach 50% by June and close to 100% by the 4th of July.</p>
<p>In the meantime I find it pathetic that there are still places with self-imposed restrictions when even the strictest of chain stores have relaxed their buttholes. There's no need to masks and security theater for your bar when I can walk into a Trader Joe's without a mask and there's a good chance someone else won't have one on either.</p>
