    <strong>I promise you. People don't care about their grandparents</strong>
    <p><p>I know that's a broad accusation so I'll explain.</p>
<p>I work at a call center with an extremely high call volume. So much so that employees are met with disciplinary action if we don't successfully resolve, <em>at minimum</em>, 7 calls per hour.</p>
<p>Let's do some middle school math.</p>
<p>7 calls per hour in a 10 hour shift equals 70 calls a day. Many of the calls are complex also. Now, for me, roughly 4 out of every 10 calls is either this or a similar conversation with someone over 60.</p>
<p>Me : I understand your frustration Mr.____, but I'd like for you to follow some steps with me so we can troubleshoot this device together. </p>
<p>Mr : I've tried, but I just don't want to fool with it!</p>
<p>Me : OK. Let's just see if we can access the settings together. I'd like for you to be able to use this device when you need it. Wouldn't that be helpful? </p>
<p>Mr : Can't you just send someone to help me?</p>
<p>Me : I'm sorry, but we don't do support visits at this time. Would you be more comfortable trying these steps with a family member, neighbor or loved one?</p>
<p>Mr : I don't have anyone - or - I've asked my children/grandchildren and they won't do it... </p>
<p>So, that's nearly 30 calls a day where someone tells me that they don't have <strong>a single person</strong> in their life to show them how to use a flip phone! </p>
<p>I knew this pandemic was never about saving grandma, but I have this whole new perspective now on people and their mindsets about the elderly. </p>
<p>Just needed to get that out.</p></p>

        <p>I would argue you probably see the worse side of it because the people who do have grandparents/older people in their lives, they probably DO help them  with how to use their flip phones.  I do not envy your job tbh - good for you for stomaching that...I hope they pay you well. </p>
<p>IMO the people who don’t care about grandma are the sick fucks who create policy that forces infected people to die in isolation.</p>

        <p>You’re right
I’m a mother of adult children and a grandmother and I just feel like an outsider. They only contact me if they need money or something like that.</p>

        <p>To be fair, as the tech guy in the family, I won’t help family either. Learned that lesson twenty years ago, when it was always my fault when something was broken after I worked on it. Sure it’s been six months and you’ve downloaded gigs of virus infected porn, but it is totally my fault you’re computer don’t work for shit now, dad.</p>

        <p>Confirmed.</p>
<p>At my work I also frequently get calls by people and while I dont get the same details as you, it is very noticable when people do a business call and end up telling a random stranger on the phone about their personal life that they are severly lacking social life. And that didnt start with Covid.</p>
<p>Shit, the other week I was told:</p>
<p>"Ill pray to Petrus that he may let you into heaven, for you have such a kind soul."</p>
<p>After a 10 min call. Like, I cant even comprehend what I do to deserve such, its not that I say anything special, I just listen and say "Oh, yes that sounds bad...", "I can relate to that, that doesnt sound good...", "Surely it will work out for you, somehow..."</p>
