        <p>Christopher Hitchens: a self-described Trotskyist, author and political commentator, admirer of both George Orwell and Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>He wasn't always correct but his voice always added value to a discussion. In this clip he is in a debate speaking against a Canadian resolution <em>for</em> hate speech restrictions. This is worth watching, and setting a reminder at least annually to watch again.</p>

        <p>Leftists especially Redditors tend to be useful idiots. Look at how they are celebrating the silencing of their political enemies because the mainstream media has brainwashed them to think this is the right and moral action to take.</p>

        <p>"Every time you silence somebody you make yourself a prisoner of your own action because you deny yourself the right to hear something."</p>
<p>From the linked clip. We have shifted so far to leftist control where they have no fear of being wrong, or ever being a minority party, that they have no concept of "what if I'm wrong and my opponents use this power against me?"</p>

        <p>Hitch was a personal hero of mine. He would have fought lockdowns tooth and nail until his last breath. That’s how much he valued freedom. Really really great man.</p>

        <p>Throughout all of this I’ve occasionally thought about how he would’ve reacted to all this shit. Would be nice to have him around and have his voice calling out this criminal intrusion into peoples’ lives. I didn’t always agree with what he had to say, but he was always one of the smartest people in the room, and almost assuredly was the best orator wherever he was.</p>
