    <strong>You can sleep with your partner but can’t play tennis 🎾 with them! Can shoot ducks 🦆 but can’t feed them!</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday the chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust confirmed that in the county’s main hospital there are just <strong>seven</strong> patients suffering from coronavirus, three of them in intensive care.</p>
<p>Yet on the strength of that minuscule number of cases, a county of <strong>565,000</strong>people is being shut down. Businesses are again closing their doors and many will never reopen. Cornwall, like the rest of the country, is braced for a jobs’ bloodbath.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the average age of those dying ‘with Covid’ is 82.5 — <strong>a year older than the average life expectancy. (Evidence that Covid extends life by a year on average!)</strong></p>
<p>For instance, you can shoot ducks, but you can’t feed them. You can sleep with your wife or husband, but you can’t play tennis with them.</p>
<p>Figures out yesterday showed that more than <strong>3.5 million over-50s have had scheduled operations cancelled by Our Amazing NHS</strong>.</p>

<p>“On Friday in Treliske there were three people with Covid. We’ve closed down Cornwall because three people are in hospital.’</p>
<p>She also claimed that patients who died from flu were being registered dishonestly as Covid victims on death certificates.”</p></p>
