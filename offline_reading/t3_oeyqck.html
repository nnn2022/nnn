    <strong>Being forced to take vaccine for medical school, any ideas for what to do?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm close to finishing medical school and my school recently made the COVID vaccination mandatory. I am probably the only person in my class who has not gotten it already (most got it right away even before it was mandatory like a bunch of good sheep). I am already in 200k+ debt and am going to apply to a very competitive specialty. I'm very much against the vaccine but am very scared of making an enemy of my administration because they basically hold my entire future in their hands. All it takes is one member of the administration (and these people are sick, trust me) to make it a mission to contact residencies I'm applying to and tell them to not take me and I'm fucked for life. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At this point I am wondering if I should just get it. I believe that at best the vaccine is a rushed out, un-proven and possibly dangerous big pharma cash grab. At worst, I believe it is something much more nefarious. But I'm not sure what else to do. I feel like if I get it, there is a low change of anything actually happening. I'm a healthy person, my family got it and nothing happened. If I don't get it and try to argue an exemption there is a high chance my administration will dislike me and possibly make me get it anyway. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Any advice on what to do? I think it is sick that this is even an issue. Forcing people to inject something into their blood against their will is evil.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah no doubt I know that the right thing to do is to not take the vaccine. It just sucks because I might be in the worst position possible for someone who is against this vaccine. Very precarious position financially and professionally, in a community that has no sympathy for questioning any science. If I was in any other position it wouldn't even be a question.</p>

        <p>That's where they want you.. it's defined as 'coercion' and is a clear trampling of your rights , freedoms, dignity and right to privacy.</p>
<p>This is not an 'emergency' situation any longer with covid19, so none of these actions can be warranted.</p>
<p>Perhaps talk to a lawyer to help you if you don't have the resolve yourself.</p>

        <p>It is definitely coercion, but as all medical students know, abuse and coercion are par for the course. The residency match is one of the biggest bullshit processes in the country. Once you make an enemy out of someone in a position of power, they have free reign to fuck your life up. Once you get a lawyer involved or anything like that, its already over. There is no guarantee no matter what you do that any residency has to take you. If a residency doesn't take you, you are stuck in 300k debt with no job prospects and 10 years of your life wasted. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is the reason I would discourage anyone from going to medical school now. Not because its hard, or requires a lot of studying, its simply because of the way you're abused by the system.</p>

        <p>You have to take many other vaccines as a med student, if something nefarious was to be done by someone in a higher position it would already be done. The whole point of it being untested is fair though, and it could cause issues. If I was in your situation I would take the shot, a lot better than wasting your whole life.</p>

        <p>This is a fair take and I agree. I had never paid attention to the possibility that the medical establishment was lying prior to this "pandemic." I think the probability that a serious negative side effect happens if I get the vaccine is low but still possible. In a vacuum I would obviously choose not to get it, but I'm not sure if it is worth risking my entire life over. I have a wife and will be trying for kids soon too so I have to be successful in this, there is no choice.</p>

        <p>600k dead. Nearly 4000 still dying every week. 99% of them unvaccinated. But somehow pandemic deserves to be in quotes as if it’s not a real thing. My buddy’s dad died from covid. Guess that wasn’t real.</p>
<p>I take back what I said earlier. If you’re actually in med school just quit. Being a professional in health care obviously isn’t a good fit for you.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this insight. I graduated a few years back and considered a PhD and but didn’t pursue due to similar issues with abuse and coercion in psych at the graduate level. </p>
<p>Recently had been thinking of neuro for med school but this was a major concern and hearing your experience helps. Do you know if PA school has it as bad?</p>

        <p>I don't know much about PA school. I know it is pretty difficult to get into and requires a lot of shadowing hours before you apply. I am sure they suffer from the same hivemind mentality and scientism worship. But it is a significantly less long road and you don't have to deal with residency match so it doesn't put you in nearly as precarious a position. I'd say it is worth it to look into if you're passionate about seeing patients because you can make some good money and work good hours if you find a good PA gig.</p>

        <p>Imagine going to medical school and still not understand how vaccines work. People like you shouldn’t be in the healthcare field. This sub is a toxic waste field.

        <p>Thankfully medical schools are requiring them to get vaccinated and if they don't they get the boot. Unfortunately during and after the post truth Trump era in which covid was during it really ramped up the conspiracies against vaccines like we've never seen and is a telling sign of just how susceptible people are to blatant lies and disinformation. For some it's too jig a hole to even try to get out of and like most avid Trump supporters they're too far gone to reason with.</p>

        <p>I think you’ve said it. Stand your ground, and hope for the best but prepare for the worst. Your skills and knowledge will be useful. That’s my position anyway, and I have made peace with losing my workshop if my landlord decides he doesn’t want uninjected people around, as well as my snooker club (my hobby) starting to make noises of the uninjected being unwelcome. Also taking my daughter out of school and worse - such as us being sent to detention centres for those refusing the jab. I don’t see this going any other way tbh. Sorry it’s a bit bleak.</p>

        <p>You are in a tough position...</p>
<p>If you resign yourself to having to do it, you could always try to argue an exemption on waiting until a better non-mRNA alternative comes out, like Novavax.  You won't be refusing outright, just temporarily waiting.  That could at least buy time and it may not be hard to dig up family medical history of heart and blood clot concerns.</p>
<p>It's not ideal, but if you are going to do it, a subunit based one sounds a lot better than what is out there now.</p>

        <p>You need to loudly and frequently proclaim to everyone that you refuse to take it and continually and confidently talk about how there are literally zero studies on the vaccine. Don't be a pussy - stand up for yourself. If you don't get to get into the medical industry, that's fine - there are plenty of jobs out there. For example, you can go work as a waiter at a restaurant - they're hiring like crazy.</p>

        <p>I can guarantee youre not the only one whos not had it, thats just how they want you to feel. Maybe send a circular mail to all students from an anonymous email address and voice your concerns and ask anybody in the same boat to reply. That way you have a stronger voice. Even just ask anybody who doesnt agree they should be mandatory to reply. Then march to the head principle (or whatever the main bossman is called) lol</p>

<p>Seriously, you have been explicitly educated on every mechanism involving vaccination. What <em>exactly</em> do you take issue with regarding the vaccine? When your peers act like you're crazy for rejecting the literal occupational material you are supposed to be learning, do you never take a step back and wonder "am I the idiot here"?

        <p>There have to be others in your situation that you can find online. Find those people and see what they are doing. Religious exemption? Needle allergy? You need to lie. We aren't dealing with moral people here.  Or stand your ground and find a medical organization or medical path that will welcome you. This won't be easy but you seem to have the courage to do this.</p>

        <p>A lot of people are saying to avoid it out of principle. </p>
<p>I disagree, I'm totally against the vaccine and putting your health at risk for some political nonsense, but this is your entire career you'd be throwing away here.</p>
<p>Is the small known risk of death/health problems worth your future in medicine? It probably is in this specific scenario. </p>
<p>You could seek legal advise and I'm sure you'll find a way around it, but like you said is it worth risking the bullseye on your head?</p>

        <p>I thought medical schools required passing basic physics for admission?</p>
<p>I mean, this is you arguing the Earth is flat:</p>
<p>&rt; You are just not understanding basic physics man. It doesn't matter if you're born in it, the constant change of direction IS THE CHANGE. The velocity is always changing. It doesn't matter if an ant wouldn't fall off a merry go round, there is a LITERAL FORCE created by the constant acceleration. And that force would be massive given the speeds the earth is traveling. Yet we can't feel or measure any such force whatsoever. THAT LITERALLY MAKES NO SENSE.</p>
<p>This is high-school level of physics, man. It's obvious that you have a contentious relationship with science. Why do you even want to go into regulated world of medicine? Are you trying to get into a lucrative specialty that won't require critical thinking?</p>

        <p>I’m curious since you are educated in medicine. From a scientific perspective, what in particular has you concerned more about the vaccine than actually catching the virus? </p>
<p>If you’ve had covid, then I totally get your position on not wanting the vax since it would make little sense as you would already have acquired immunity.</p>

        <p>Basically my concern for catching the virus and dying from it is 0%. I don't believe COVID 19 poses any risk whatsoever to a healthy person my age. There have always been coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses that kill vulnerable people every year. And when you change the rules to record the deaths of basically anyone who had a cough as a covid 19 death, you can get whatever death count you want. I know literally thousands of people, including my family, friends, people from grade school, high school, college, medical school, etc. I don't know a single person that died of coronavirus or was even hospitalized. I have also seen how this entire "pandemic" is clearly either entirely created or at least hijacked and used for political purposes to trample on our rights, divide people, increase the wealth gap and destroy small businesses, and continue to usher in the growing medical technocracy.</p>

        <p>So you feel the vaccine is essentially unnecessary for you. I think the counter argument is that health care providers typically work with a vulnerable population and that we should take every reasonable action to protect those that we interact with. </p>
<p>While I understand the rest of what you wrote, pointing out those you know who have had covid is anecdotal, though assuming you’re in your early 20’s, moderate-severe disease is somewhat of a rarity. I don’t disagree with your assessment on the how the pandemic was manipulated politically, though it’s a bit unrelated to what your science based rationale on not taking the vaccine is. I haven’t seen anything that would lead me to believe the death counts are inflated. </p>
<p>Do those that you know that are currently in clinical ID practice agree with your take?</p>

        <p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2770542">Studies are showing that even young people can die from COVID</a>. </p>
<p>(Summary: 3,000 adults ages 18 to 34 who contracted COVID-19 and became sick enough to require hospital care, 21% ended up in intensive care, 10% were placed on a breathing machine and 2.7% died)</p>
<p>Granted, the risk is increased with other problems like obesity and diabetes, so if your chances were low they're even lower without those problems, but it's not 0%. Even infants are dying from it. That said, the vaccine isn't just for you, it's also for any older folks around you that might be at risk, such as a father or mother, grandparents, etc. Asymptomatic people can spread the virus. That's why it swept through the world so quickly. People didn't think they were sick and so visited freely with others. Those of us that are taking the vaccine are also trying to protect friends and family.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you were going 66,000 mph you would feel it lol. And thats only one of the motions of the earth. The sun itself is traveling hundreds of thousands of mph around the milky way, and the milky way is traveling millions of mph around the big bang. It is ludicrous to just brush these off and act like its normal that we feel absolutely none of this.</p>

        <p>I would really stop and take a long think about what you are doing with your life and position you are in. As someone working in a medical field around plenty of immunocompromised people they really need to make sure you are not a vector for covid to infect people. If you want to understand their position imagine instead it was a tb vaccine, it would make sense to need to vaccinate you. As a doctor you have first hand access to the vaccine studies and an entire history of data on vaccines in general, how they are made, how they are tested etc</p>

<p>So it is a reasonable requirement to force some one to take something that goes against their deeply held spiritual beliefs?</p>
<p>Okay then Muslims and Jews should be able to be forced to eat pork.
Muslim women should be forced to remove their Niqabs...for safety reasons.</p>
<p>If you can force some one to take a vaccine agianst their deeply held spiritual beliefs then  you can justify forcing anything on anyone.</p>

        <p>I hope you're still looking in here, after deleting your account.  My idea for what you should do is tell your med school that you refuse to get vaccinated, in accordance to standard medical practice, so they will waste no time in kicking your sorry ass out.  You aren't qualified to be a medical doctor, nor even a student. </p>

        <p>I mean, you came to this echo chamber for some confirmation bias, you have no intention on changing your mind, you just want a pat on the back saying your doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Which your not. If you do make it in to medical school I can guarantee when completed you will look back on this as one of the cringiest things you've ever done.</p>
<p>Or your completely full of it and this is all made up. Honestly, at this point it looks like you want to die on this hill, which is insane.</p>
<p>If you want a honest, and fair opinion, go talk to "medical school" peers, not a bunch of uneducated Internet bumpkins like us.</p>

        <p>&rt;I believe that at best the vaccine is a rushed out, un-proven and possibly dangerous big pharma cash grab</p>
<p>Well, maybe go to medical school to figure out the skill set to do that.</p>
<p>There is zero evidence that it's been rushed compared to any other vaccine. It's gone through all the same procedural processes as any other medical intervention.</p>
<p>You can believe it all you want, but why run on faith to restrict your access to medical school?</p>
