    <strong>Pharma does not have your best interests in mind</strong>
    <p><p>If the government/health officials/doctors/nurses/politicians/news outlets focused on actual health and not bandaids for enabling people to continue to live off preservatives, sugar, and chemicals, we’d have had a fraction of the people die from covid that we did. </p>
<p>If the FDA actually prevented chemicals that have very well known negative health impacts, from being in our deodorant, shampoo, lotions, laundry detergents, makeup, soaps, cleaning products, water, literally in everything that goes on/in our bodies, we’d have had significantly less people die from covid. </p>
<p>If we focused on fixing the root issues of any health problems that arise instead of slapping a pill bandaid on it, we’d have had significantly less people die from covid. </p>
<p>If we taught people the importance of eating whole organic foods that aren’t covered in deadly pesticides, and exercising, instead of insisting that obese people can still be healthy, we’d have had a lot less people die from covid. </p>
<p>If we didn’t screw with peoples immune systems by vaccinating at all, we’d have had a lot less people die from covid (and a hell of a lot less autoimmune disorders).</p>
<p>If we didn’t sensor everyone who had a bad reaction to the vaccine and pretend like everything is fine and dandy while so many are dying or being diagnosed with lasting health problems BECAUSE of the vaccine, we’d have people that were better equipped to make informed decisions about their health rather than choosing based on what’s popular and exciting right now. </p>
<p>Teach people how to be HEALTHY. Don’t teach people that their only hope for living comes in pill or syringe form. If you have health problems, a lot of times- it’s your fault. We blame genetics way too much while refusing to acknowledge that we can take control of our health by making better choices. </p>
<p>We live in the age of information. You can find anything you want online. You can find healthier products that aren’t made from chemicals. You can learn about healthy living and why we have the health problems that we do today. You can find healthy recipes and workout plans. It is YOUR fault if you continue to choose to live in ignorance.</p>
<p>Pharma does not exist because they want you to be healthy. The CDC does not exist because they want you to be healthy. HHS/FDA does not exist because they want you to be healthy. </p>
<p>If you think the people who make money off of sickness have your best interests in mind, you’re a damn fool. </p>
<p>There, I said it.</p></p>
