        <p><strong>Stop you contracting the virus</strong></p>
<p>Fair point, my understanding is the phase III clinical trials (<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> / <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389">Moderna</a>) were measuring symptoms (disease and severe disease), not people getting a positive PCR test.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop the spread of the virus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Phase III clinical trials didn't study this, so they can't conclude one way or the other. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253275v1">More recent studies</a> have shown that the vaccine reduces the likelyhood of transmission.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Put an end to masking and lockdowns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">stated</a> vaccinated people can mostly stop masking outdoors, a vaccinated household can meet with another unvaccinated household indoors without masks. The CDC has also stated that many different households of unvaccinated people can gather indoors without masks. Additionally, all states have announced plans for re-opening. Even <a href="https://forward.ny.gov/">New York</a>, <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">California</a>, and <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/reopening-massachusetts#main-content">Massachusetts</a> have rolled back restrictions, and will roll them back more in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decrease severe reactions to the virus?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FALSE FALSE FALSE!: In the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> trial, 162 in the placebo group had a case of covid-19, but only 8 in the vaccine group. In the Moderna trial, 185 in the placebo group had a case of covid-19, but only 11 in the vaccine group.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower hospitalizations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FALSE FALSE FALSE!: In the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> trial, 10 in the placebo group had a SEVERE case of covid-19, but only 1 in the vaccine group. In the Moderna trial, 30 in the placebo group had a SEVERE case of covid-19, but only 0 in the vaccine group.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the chance of dying from the virus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FALSE FALSE FALSE!: In the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> trial, no one died of covid in the placebo or vaccinated groups. In the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389">Moderna</a> trial, one person in the placebo group died of covid</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are the safety tests complete?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Phase 3 clinical trials have been completed, and the vaccines have been granted an Emergency Use Authorization. I'll concede that more long term studies will be beneficial, but I would say this is true for all drugs, from Tylenol to the Pfizer Vaccine. It should be noted that the vaccines don't have FDA approval yet, but this process is underway. The FDA has determined "The known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product."</p>
<ul>
<li>Has it caused deaths and injuries</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not aware of any deaths or injuries that have been attributed to the mRNA vaccines. Th JnJ vaccine has been linked to 1 death and 15 cases of TTS/CVTS out of 6.8 million doses, but the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda-cdc-lift-vaccine-use.html">FDA and CDC has confidence that vaccine is safe and effective</a>. I would conclude that the FDA responding to 6 adverse event shows how much scrutiny they are placing on these vaccines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the manufacturers liable in any way for harm caused by the vaccine?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not unique to covid vaccines. Even for TDAP, MMR, or HPV vaccines, the manufacturers are not liable. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/compensation-for-victims-of-covid-vaccine-injuries-is-limited.html">It is true</a> that the payout system for the covid vaccines is different than for other vaccines, and it is harder to get money out of the CICP. The money paid to victims of any vaccines is from the US government, not the pharma companies.</p>

        <p>You're not supposed to fiddle with the things, getting saliva from the mask onto your hands. Even if not for covid, why put saliva on your hands?</p>
<p>If you're outside, and then plan on going outside or vice versa, just keep the mask on. Like the image of the woman in the car with a mask and face shield. While face shields have been shown to be ineffective, if you're in a car, you obviously plan on going to someplace, possibly inside, to be surrounded by other people.</p>

        <p>I fiddle with whatever I want. I go for long distance runs and bike rides. There is no way I'm looking like those utter fools and wearing a mask outside on running and cyclist paths. I'm not wearing it in my car. I'm not wearing it in my own fucking house or places of business.  </p>
<p><em>Why stop at not wanting saliva on your hands, though? Why not prevent it from getting on your food? Time to start ingesting food via the anus! Hell, now that I think of it, ew, nasty, imagine having your own saliva in your own mouth. I need to buy a mouth vacuum to make sure my mouth is completely saliva free at all times. But I will still wear a triple mask though, because I want to make sure everyone can see how much better of a person I am than they are.</em></p>

        <p>That's the kind of attitude that pisses me off. Fucking busybodies, soapboxing and grandstanding, telling people what they "should and should not" be doing, under the guise of "for the greater good". It's incredibly condescending on its face, and no, I'm not fucking "okay" with it. Obviously.  </p>
<p>I am sick to fucking death of this shit. Whenever I see a person, out-fucking-side, nowhere near anyone else, wearing two, TWO, god damned masks, it makes me want to bash their fucking skull in with a claw hammer. Put the dumb fuck out of their misery.  </p>
<p><em>No, that doesn't mean I'm actually going to fucking do it, you stupid shits. I'm just being hyperbolic, because the situation pisses me the fuck off.</em>  </p>
<p>Being "civil" with people over these issues is no longer an option for me. I'm going full mayhem mode. Scorched Earth. No point trying to be nice to passive-aggressive moral grandstanders anyway. Self-serving virtue-signaling elbow-bumping coof cultists. May they all end up in a mass grave of their own design.</p>

        <p>Um, hello? Me Oog. Me find this Reddit post right here, three-hundred million years ago. This way back before Oog spine straightened, front lobes developed, comprehend rational thought...<em>master English language.</em></p>
<p>So, there me was, beating boulder into powder, because me couldn't eat it, and magic ball land in lap. Naturally, me think: "All right, free egg!" because me stupid and me caveman. So, me spend about three days humping and bust open with thigh bone so me could eat it good. Then magic ball shoot Oog with beam, and next thing me know, me go out and invent wheel out of dinosaur brain. Magic dino-wheel rolls for three short distance until me eat it, but point is: me get smarter. Soon, me walk upright, me feather back dirty matted hair into wings for style, and me stop to use bathroom, as opposed to me just doing it as me walk.</p>

        <p>Yeah apparently they got moved to "le right" because they made fun of Karl Marx for being a disgusting fatbody. I didn't get that memo. But it's okay. Moderate conservatives are more fun anyway.  </p>
<p>Amusing how you completely dropped your initial point though. Because you actually realized it was an indefensible thing to even come up with. I'll stick around, anyway. Regardless of whether you want to keep trying to flood this place with your virtue signaling gutter piss.</p>

        <p>Yep we need facts and sources (which exist) not cartoons and exaggeration.</p>
<p>The middle three are disputable. If I'm honest I don't trust that these jabs do anything positive at all but you're right we must stick with facts and sources. </p>
<p>I've been thinking about making and distributing leaflets myself. I feel like poeple see how the media succeeds in getting idiots to follow orders and feel like they need to take the same approach in order to have any chance of being listened to.</p>
<p>I believe the opposite is true, people are tired of being treated like babies who can't understand anything. We should take the opposite approach and be calm and factual and no need for memes or cartoons that make you feel like you are being patronised. </p>
<p>It's a fallacy that some things are too complicated for the average person to understand, or at the very least it's a self fulfilling prophecy. In fact, if you can't explain something in a way that the average person can understand, then you don't fully understand it yourself.</p>

        <p>Once again, you are muddying the water. 4178 <strong>official</strong> deaths due to the vaccine is very disingenuous. From your own link, it says:  </p>
<p>&rt; Over 245 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from December 14, 2020, through May 3, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 4,178 reports of death (0.0017%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. CDC and FDA physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and CDC requests medical records to further assess reports. A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&amp;J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event—blood clots with low platelets—which has caused deaths.  </p>
<p>People were rightly dismayed that the CDC was counting anyone who died <em>with</em> Covid as a death <em>from</em> Covid, including car accidents and gun shots. So you cannot exactly in good faith turn around and say any death in any person who got the vaccine was <em>caused</em> by the vaccine. It is possible, and likely in some cases, but please do not misrepresent facts and say that the 4178 were officially proven to be caused by the vaccine, because that is false.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter anyway since Covid is a media and corporate-induced hoax.</p>
<p>Per the CDC: In only ~5% of the 560,616 "COVID deaths" was COVID-19 the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. The other ~95% of "COVID deaths" had an average of 4.0 additional comorbidities. So, since ~March 2020, an absolute maximum of ~28,000 people in the US have died solely from COVID.</p>

        <p>To be fair it does lower the chance of dying and hospitalization to essentially zero. So 4,5,6 are very wrong. But that's why it makes zero difference if anyone else takes it, its a personal decision.</p>

        <p>Dude I'm well aware that the chances of dying are already extremely low. But as of april 20th there have only been 77 confirmed cases of covid death in fully vaccinated people and we are seeing a 0.005% chance of hospitalization after vaccinated compared to IFR of 0.14% without vaccination. This is a significant difference. I think covid or any respiratory illness does present a serious risk to certain groups of people and it might be a good idea for them to get the vaccine. Once vaccinated they are essentially 100% safe and my choice to not get vaccinated has absolutely no effect on anyone's health.</p>

        <p>You're misunderstanding the statistics. Since breakthroughs are happening in such a small part of the vaccinated population, they're pretty special cases. Often people with unusually weak immune systems, who therefore also are more likely to get a severe infection.</p>

<p>Right.  People dont understand statistics. Example, "Being indoors gives you a 18.7 times chance of catching covid". Thats not enough information to make a decision - sure being outside sounds better (and it is), but 18.7 times <em>what</em>?. You can buy 19 lottery tickets and have a 19x chance of winning the lottery vs 1, but you know what? You still arent winning the lottery.</p>
<p>People also get tricked. "50% more". Is that 50 percent points added? Or is the chance higher by half? Are we talking about a 5-&rt;50% chance, or a 5-&rt;7.5% chance?</p>

        <p>No, it doesn't.  The absolute risk reduction is quite low.  You are unlikely to get covid, even without the shot.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</p>
<p>If you do have a breakthrough case, the average is maybe down to 1% death, while the pandemic long average US deathrate was 1.8%  That is only what, about a 40% relative reduction? </p>
<p>The hospitalization rate is 9%, but I don't know what the US average hospitalization rate is off the top of my head.  I think I saw 7% once, which would mean the shot is increasing your risk of hospitalization by 33%.  Hopefully not, but that would be funny.</p>
<p>It's not as miraculous as you are making it out to be.  The CDC data shows this.</p>

        <p>Dude I'm well aware that the chances of dying are already extremely low. But as of april 20th there have only been 77 confirmed cases of covid death in fully vaccinated people and we are seeing a 0.005% chance of hospitalization after vaccinated compared to IFR of 0.14% without vaccination. This is a significant difference. I think covid or any respiratory illness does present a serious risk to certain groups of people and it might be a good idea for them to get the vaccine. Once vaccinated they are essentially 100% safe and my choice to not get vaccinated has absolutely no effect on anyone's health.</p>

        <p>It’s funny that you believe that. Their own data says that the vaccine does not stop transmission of the virus. You’re still being asked to wear masks if you get it, people have died from, the vaccine makers are not liable if something bad happens to you.</p>

        <p>There is very little data on the vacine's impact on transmission one way or the other. Can you provide a link to back up "Their own data says the vaccine does not stop transmission" ?</p>
<p>If there's a study to back that up, I'd love to see it. If you are just inferring that based on CDC guidance, that's different.</p>

        <p>One theory I saw is that the vaccine isn't really dangerous, but it will prevent a new virus that will be released that will actually be deadly. That way the skeptics would be killed off, while the sheep survive.</p>
<p>I don't believe that, but that's one theory going around.</p>

        <p>If it were me, I’d start with the easiest or most willing targets first. Start with ones that won’t fight, weaken the numbers slowly, then you’ll have less numbers to contend with when you finally meet resistance.</p>

        <p>It's been over a year. I have travelled to different states. I've gone to gyms unmasked, stayed in Airbnbs and hostels, yet hear I am. I haven't gotten sick at all. Yet I am still being told I need to get vaccinated. Why? I am told if not for me than to protect others. I will not risk my life or wellbeing so Grandmas can eek out a few more months. There I said it. Fuck Grandmas!</p>

        <p>Its funny because no vaccine company is liable! If they were, they'd never make a vaccine. There was an act put in place to prevent this. So if you were hurt, you'd receive money from the government.</p>

        <p>You're doing the same shit you hate from the msm consumers. Misrepresenting and actually just blatantly lying about the facts. You're merely propagandizing the opposite view.</p>
<p>It's totally valid to be critical about the vaccine and the circumstances surrounding it but it's intellectually dishonest to discredit the data supporting the efficacy of the vaccines to prevent serious disease and death from covid. Sure covid has a tiny death rate but the hospitalization rate isn't trivial, it's 1%.</p>

<p>I'll let you discover on your own that this sort of opener will never accomplish anything with any bona-fide thinking person. I've got plenty to be concerned about and I don't feel like typing it out 10 times in a row to every miserable shit that thinks they found a non-believer to convert.</p>
<p>Preach to the choir -- fine. Don't run around like a smart ass thinking you're stirring up intelligent conversation. It's not going to do anything except scare people off from being skeptical, which is the exact opposite of what you want. It's also going to cause people who might agree with you to give zero fucks about engaging, because nobody likes a troll, even as a friend.</p>

        <p>To me, "afraid of the truth" sounds like Mulder on the X-Files screaming "you can't handle the truth!". It's a bit thick and I've only seen it used is as trollbait.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is wrong. Your writing style is brand new to me. I may have misread. Can't tell yet.</p>
<p>We fucked the world with lock downs. Not OK. Everyone wants answers. Putting a shitty pamphlet that doesn't actually have any answers right up in people's faces is stupid. That's the real bullshit.</p>
<p>Where is the information about how SARS2 AND the vaccines both impact the renin-angiotensin system? Because based on scientific whitepapers I've read that I pretend to understand, it sounds an awful lot like the vaccines can do the exact same damage that SARS2 can do.</p>
<p>IANAD. Fact check and correct me because I want real answers. Renin-angiotensin is an enzymatic system that controls blood pressure, adrenal function, etc. This is where SARS damage occurs, and this is also the same system that the vaccines seek to stimulate/regulate. All enzymatic systems function on some principle of balance, where one enzyme is always down or up-regulated by another. To my layperson mind, this sounds like most people on a wide variety of medications shouldn't be taking this new drug. </p>
<p>Duh. We know vaccines have error rates, money's involved, blah blah blah. But we don't KNOW risk factors on this batch and I don't like the biology they're playing with. It's too central.</p>
<p>The internet is full of shitty pamphlets. Nobody wants shitty IRL pamphlets. Ordinary people will just laugh at the whole thing. Skeptics will agree with a couple points and ignore the rest.</p>
<p>End result? 2/3+ of society tune out. Mission not accomplished.</p>
<p>Hence being pissed off. I really, really hate getting crap like this in the mail and I hate it when people don't see how cheering for this kind of propaganda is basically the same as shooting yourself in the foot.</p>

        <p>Items one and two simply aren't true. The vaccines are extremely effective, but that's not the question. Life jackets are effective, also, but if I'm not on a boat I don't wear one. Otherwise healthy young adults, and especially children, are at vanishingly small risk from Covid. The risk/benefit analysis changes greatly for the elderly as they are at exponentially increased risk and have much shorter life expectancies.</p>

        <p>It lowers reactions and yes you can catch it. But you have no symptoms. That’s why you still wear the mask. Also it does decrease the chance of dying to the virus. That’s why elderly people, that have weaker immune systems have to take it. No one has died from it. That 2 year old boy that supposedly died from the vaccine has no proof to say that he did. And the vaccine is safe or they wouldn’t be rolling it out. You people need to check your facts and site your sources. Just believing some dumb checklist boomer meme is not factual Karen.</p>

<p>The Phase III clinical trials didn't study this, so they can't conclude one way or the other. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.11.21253275v1">More recent studies</a> have shown that the vaccine reduces the likelyhood of transmission.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Put an end to masking and lockdowns</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The CDC has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">stated</a> vaccinated people can mostly stop masking outdoors,  a vaccinated household can meet with another unvaccinated household indoors without masks. The CDC has also stated that many different households of unvaccinated people can gather indoors without masks. Additionally, all states have announced plans for re-opening. Even <a href="https://forward.ny.gov/">New York</a>, <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">California</a>, and <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/reopening-massachusetts#main-content">Massachusetts</a>  have rolled back restrictions, and will roll them back more in the future.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<li><strong>Decrease severe reactions to the virus?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FALSE FALSE FALSE!: In the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> trial, 162 in the placebo group had a case of covid-19, but only 8 in the vaccine group. In the Moderna trial, 185 in the placebo group had a case of covid-19, but only 11 in the vaccine group.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower hospitalizations</strong></li>

<p>FALSE FALSE FALSE!: In the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> trial, 10 in the placebo group had a SEVERE case of covid-19, but only 1 in the vaccine group. In the Moderna trial, 30 in the placebo group had a SEVERE case of covid-19, but only 0 in the vaccine group.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce the chance of dying from the virus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>FALSE FALSE FALSE!: In the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-conclude-phase-3-study-covid-19-vaccine">Pfizer</a> trial, no one died of covid in the placebo or vaccinated groups. In the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389">Moderna</a> trial, one person in the placebo group died of covid</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are the safety tests complete?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The Phase 3 clinical trials have been completed, and the vaccines have been granted an Emergency Use Authorization. I'll concede that more long term studies will be beneficial, but I would say this is true for all drugs, from Tylenol to the Pfizer Vaccine. It should be noted that the vaccines don't have FDA approval yet, but this process is underway. The FDA has determined "The known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product."</p>
<ul>
<li>Has it caused deaths and injuries</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not aware of any deaths or injuries that have been attributed to the mRNA vaccines. Th JnJ vaccine has been linked to 1 death and 15 cases of TTS/CVTS out of 6.8 million doses, but the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/fda-cdc-lift-vaccine-use.html">FDA and CDC has confidence that vaccine is safe and effective</a>. I would conclude that the FDA responding to 6 adverse event shows how much scrutiny they are placing on these vaccines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the manufacturers liable in any way for harm caused by the vaccine?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not unique to covid vaccines. Even for TDAP, MMR, or HPV vaccines, the manufacturers are not liable. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/compensation-for-victims-of-covid-vaccine-injuries-is-limited.html">It is true</a> that the payout system for the covid vaccines is different than for other vaccines, and it is harder to get money out of the CICP. The money paid to victims of any vaccines is from the US government, not the pharma companies.</p>

        <p>So I’m told the vaccines will give you a 95% protection. Meaning afterwards you’ll only have a 5% chance of catching it. If it’s less likely to be caught, less will have it, it’s less likely to spread. </p>
<p>No comments on masks or lockdowns.</p>
<p>My understanding is that you have an increased chance of not becoming seriously ill after vaccination. </p>
<p>If less have it, and less have it severely, less hospitalisation. </p>
<p>Again my understanding is you an increased chance of not becoming seriously ill, so that’s a reduce in deaths(?)</p>
<p>I don’t believe safety tests are complete. I think it’s reasonable to believe it’s ongoing. </p>
<p>Currently manufactures are not liable. I don’t think they make any money on it either. Perhaps that last bit is no longer true and was never true for all of the manufacturers. </p>
