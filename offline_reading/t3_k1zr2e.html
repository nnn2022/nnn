    <strong>r/Coronavirus section of Reddit</strong>
    <p><p>Just gotta say, those are some of the most dumbed down idiotic morons around. Seriously, those are the type of people that can‚Äôt park their cars straight. When they were teens, they couldn‚Äôt even color coloring books in the lines.</p>
<p>I been kicked off that part of the forum 6 times now, just for posting FACT. Post news broadcast of them telling us not to wear mask and then asking why now they tell us to, and those people panic and rant at you. ‚ÄúUh the science changed and they learned more so they want us in mask‚Äù - really, I mean... REALLY?Post information about the vaccine and how they are trying to make everyone have it and those morons say, ‚Äúit should be forced, anyone who refuses should be locked up‚Äù show them proof of what‚Äôs in the vaccine and they deny it, even though it‚Äôs in the media on news sites all over.</p>
<p>WTF kinda thinking and logic is that?  These people make my piles of shit look more intelligent.</p>
<p>I swear I see them posting about people meeting and having a normal thanksgiving and they rant and complain saying, ‚Äúthose people are stupid and endangering life‚Äôs‚Äù and the same people saying that shit are going to Biden rallies cheering around numerous people, or posting their family is coming üòí</p>
<p>One guy went off on me for stating I‚Äôll have a normal thanksgiving with numerous over yet he made a post speaking of attending BLM protestüòè Fucking moron</p></p>

        <p>I was around when all of those coronavirus subreddits were created. I came from r/Wuhan_Flu which was quarantined due to 'misinformation,' even though everyone was just discussing how to prepare and protect themselves from the disease at that time. There were so many research articles and just all-around good discussion. The sub remained quarantined even after links from there were eventually spread on mainstream media. Everyone in there started to become skeptical and then the mods got replaced with shittier ones from those other corona subs. </p>
<p>Everything that has happened over the year has led me to believe that all of those other corona subreddits are there to brainwash you. We aren't supposed to be questioning or figuring any of this stuff out. I really do hope that even those who are severely brainwashed will snap at some point and realize something is amiss. Everyone standing up against these tyrannical leaders is what we need.</p>

        <p>Seriously? You guys are against the vaccine too? Seriously? The vaccine would eliminate the "new normal". </p>
<p>I disagree with the general stance on masks found here. Lockdowns I'm more on the fence. But if you're against vaccines then this is truly just an anti science circle jerk. It has nothing to do with conflicting data or opposing ideals. It's just straight up tinfoil hatting.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to wear masks. Nobody wants to lockdown. I'm going to be beyond pissed if anti vaccine people keep this shit going by refusing a vaccine that was developed by a free market competition between private companies. Just stop.</p>

        <p>A vaccine won't get rid of covid. Also I think most people are simply against taking a rushed vaccine which was produced in less than a year (usually it takes years of testing for it to come on the market safely). Also they already confirmed that the vaccine will have side effects, which are the same as covid side effects.. What's the point here? The problem is they're trying to make it mandatory and force it on everyone. Why? Why would I have to inject some shit in my body if that's not what I want nor am I in risk. I don't need some chemical juice in my body to make me safe from a 99.9% survivable virus. I already got an immune system for that shit.</p>

        <p>You guys realise that the 99.9 figure comes from a best estimate table right? There exists a moderate and worst case estimate. As well as you know, actual data that is not an estimate that has the mortality rate at 2-10% depending on which country you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Again 100% wrong. You are not skeptical but in denial. And they are much more than just estimates. It is data backed by testing and good science. And it is data that clearly points in the same highly logical direction. Obviously no where close to everyone will get tested especially if they are asymptomatic. Stop the denialism.</p>

        <p>No, I am skeptical. If an estimate came out saying covid is 5x more deadly than previously thought I would be skeptical.</p>
<p>"Obviously no where close to everyone will get tested"</p>
<p>Of course. Which is why not everyone who dies of covid will be tallied either. But you have no problem comparing confirmed deaths vs estimated cases because that fits your narrative.</p>

        <p>Just my observation but when I look around me, not everyone complied with lockdown and not everyone will want vaccine. Likely police and military brute force will need to be involved. But also globally. The entire world will need to get on the same page and orchestrate this.</p>

        <p>No. A universal vaccine mandate is "the new normal." </p>
<p>I would pay to get infected before I would accept any of the vaccines on the table now. (Well, unless one of them was "inject the patient with live Sars-CoV-2 virus.") Some of the new vaccine technologies have never been tested or used long-term on humans.</p>

        <p>LOLü§£üòÇ ‚Äústraight up tinfoil hatting‚Äù You walk around wearing a face diaper, social distancing afraid to be near others obeying the government as you wait for a vaccine that has been rushed ‚Äúusually takes 5-7 years for test and trials‚Äù to inject chemicals into your body that you don‚Äôt even know what it truly contains ‚Äúbesides what they tell you‚Äù  from a government you think cares about the people... And then you think once you take the vaccine and make everyone else have it, things will go back to normalüòÇ
Right, like they said with mask ‚Äúthis is temporary.. wear one things will go back to normal‚Äù then lockdowns ‚Äúit‚Äôs temporary, obey and things will be normal‚Äù  are things normal? Was it temporary? It‚Äôs been almost 9 months of this BS, them claiming a virus last through the winter all through the hot summer and now it‚Äôs winter again. I mean seriously,  come on! It‚Äôs so obvious this isn‚Äôt about a virus, it‚Äôs about control.</p>
<p>Because you know, the Flu vaccine is so affective it got rid of the flu virus üòè oh wait, nope. . We still have the flu
Oops, you can get a flu vaccine and still get the fluüòß Then WTF is the point of allowing them to inject you?! </p>
<p>Let me guess, you‚Äôll say, ‚Äúif every single person gets a vaccine things will be safe and normal‚Äù  so people should be forced to have it.
In which I‚Äôll say, that‚Äôs against our freedom and constitution. You can NOT force people to comply, our bodies our choice. We are not communist...
Besides, if you get the vaccine aren‚Äôt you safe? So why would it matter if others refuse? YOU GOT IT so you are supposed to magically be safe from the virus. So who cares if others don‚Äôt want it, as long as you got it they shouldn‚Äôt bother you as you are safe right?</p>
<p>In which you‚Äôd say, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs not 100% affective‚Äù still a chance you can get the virus even with the vaccine. Then I‚Äôd say again, WHY THE HELL ALLOW THEM TO INJECT YOU? </p>
<p>I‚Äôll take my chances without a vaccine, I don‚Äôt need Bill Gates chemical soup in my body. I been perfectly fine since March and around people always. No ones been sick, no ones dying on the streets. Heck, 2020 has been a year I see healthy people all over.</p>
<p>You people do realize they are forcing people to wear mask, shut down their businesses, not be around others, take the PCR test and stay locked in their homes? LITERALLY FORCING with police pushing, throwing people down, hitting them, tasing them and locking them up. Giving expensive fines for not complying when people are trust trying hard to live normally and support their families. 
They are trying to make the vaccine mandatory with people being forced to take it. Refuse and you can‚Äôt travel, work or possibly shop to buy food and products. This is a reality... They are trying to do this. Qantas airlines has stated they will require people to have the vaccine to fly.</p>
<p>Is this Nazi Germany? Show me your Covid pass &amp; papers
You support this stuff and want to live this way? It literally will be like 1942 Germany all over again with the Jew yellow star ‚≠êÔ∏è </p>
<p>What if it‚Äôs you? What if the police come bashing you for something? What if they force you to lose your income? 
What if you get the vaccine, go to travel and get stuck somewhere because your ‚Äúpass‚Äù has incorrect information.  </p>
<p>Things will NOT go back to normal, it will just get worse and they will continue to demand more out of you. Wear a mask, social distance, take our PCR test, get the vaccine, oh you need it again, the virus mutated we need to lockdown again, new vaccine take it, oh you need it again, and again and again...</p>
