    <strong>Correlations and casual relationships: lockdowns and courses of epidemic</strong>
    <p><p>If covid is already established and then you lock down and open up when cases reduce without spiking, it is not because of lockdowns, but because the virus ran its course and herd immunity took place.</p>
<p>Then, politicians will tell it was because of lockdown, when what really happened was actual herd immunity. Look at Italy, France or Spain, that had lockdowns with soldiers and tanks on the street.</p>
<p>It is correlation, not causation. When you open, you have less cases, because herd immunity took place, not because lockdown flattened some curve, or how can you explain to me that Italy, that did a super strict lockdown with army on the streets, had more deaths per million inhabitants than Sweden?</p>
<p>If you locked down when covid has not arrived, you simply starved everyone for no reason. When you open up, there are no cases because there is very little circulation of the virus.</p>
<p>The worst of all is when you lock down, accomplish nothing, and then the virus comes, because you canÂ´t control every border, and you lockdown again and it will only stop when herd immunity takes place.</p>
<p>So, there is no direct relationship between lockdown and cases or deaths. When it appears that lock down worked, it is because some other phenomenon took place.</p></p>
