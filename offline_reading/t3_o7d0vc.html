    <strong>Time to start looking</strong>
    <p><p>My employer (a very large US Company) is all about all the woke-isms. Just yesterday they announced lifting China Virus restrictions for vaccinated employees next month. We will be required to disclose vaccination status with 1 of 3 options. Vaccinated. Not Vaccinated. Or choose not to share the information. If you choose Vaccinated you have to upload your papers. </p>
<p>The icing on the cake. They announce that they are considering a mandate for the jab. </p>
<p>I can deal with the woke-isms (it's part of corporate America these days). I can deal with diversity training that tells me I have white privilege or male privilege. I can deal with a company that opposes all my political and religious views. Their stance doesn't change my faith, beliefs, or values. I can even deal with a mask (I don't have to like it or agree with it but I can deal with as the sole income earner). But I draw the line at telling me what I have to put in my body. </p>
<p>I guess it's time to start looking for a new job.</p></p>

        <p>You probably already had Corona and they want you go through pain and suffering (most people have shitty reactions to the jab) for no reason.  Don't know how the legally can't be sued for forcing you to go through pain and suffering to work.</p>

        <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recently said that employers can mandate it so there goes the seeing I guess. Lots of places are requiring it now from what I've been reading. I think it's a violation.</p>

        <p>Requiring your health status is a HIPAA violation.<br>
Requiring you take an EUA is illegal.  The "vax" is an EUA not FDA approved.  </p>
<p>If you are in an at will state, they will just fire you for something else.  Most important question, why would you want to work for these people?  This won't be the last time they ask for something illegal or something something that doesn't work with your value system.  It's not worth it, find a new job.</p>

        <p>I've been struggling with working for this company for a long time. But I am the sole income earner and made really good money. 2020 was actually my highest earning year and this year is on the same track. It was strictly financial. But, now we are debt free except for the house so I am in more of a position to move on. This appears to be the push. Most likely to move out of the state too which we have been talking about for years. </p>
<p>I'll have to look into the EUA thing.</p>
