    <strong>Yet another vaccine side-effect. That won't get recorded.</strong>
    <p><p>A good friend, mentor, and role model of mine had his "vaccine" about 3 weeks ago. Myself and others had tried to convince him to pass on it. I do understand his fear as he is 75, and has 2 artificial limbs from a work accident. He is lucky to be alive - and mentally, morally and physically strong. His return from the brink of death (he died 3 times on the operating table), and his ability to pull himself back up from unimaginable pain, loss, and suffering of his accident have been a constant inspiration to me. Walking along in jeans, you would never realize he has lost both legs above the knee and one hand. He is truly a man of God and light.</p>
<p>So imagine my state of mind when he called me from the hospital, admitted for a blood clot in his lung. His heart rate had hit 137 BPM.</p>
<p>The bastards at the hospital <em>wouldn't even let his fucking wife visit</em> him for the 4 days he was there, let alone me or any of his other friends. We couldn't even bring him anything.</p>
<p>All we could offer was phone chat - and lots of prayer.</p>
<p>He's home now, and recovering, but I guar-an-fucking-tee you this won't get recorded as an adverse "vaccine" reaction - as it should. Risk to an intelligent, kindly 75 year old man who has lived a moral life of service to others is considered less important than keeping up the Karen-O-Virus scam.</p>
<p>I hate these bastards. Some day they will pay.</p></p>

        <p>I just saw Chris from the 67 podcast say many people are reporting that they have tried to submit reports to vaers and the reports are not going up. People are trying multiple times and the website is not accepting the submissions.</p>

        <p>There is something strange about these "vaccines." Do you know which one he got?</p>
<p>Think about this. We know they don't care about our health, or we wouldn't have a nation of obesity... Where businesses that push unhealthy eating on children were declared essential.</p>
<p>We know they lied and exaggerated, and they censor and blacklist skeptics in the medical and science community.</p>
<p>And we know it's not "just about money" or else they wouldn't use these shots which have so many terrible side effects.</p>
<p>So... What is in these vaccines? Why is it so important to them that we take them?</p>
<p>It's not about health or saving lives, and it doesn't appear to be about (just) money... So --- what is it then??</p>

        <p>You probably already knew this, but Jerome Powell was in a public chat with 6 other financial leaders around the world...</p>
<p>And the topic for discussion was how the Covid-19 pandemic paved the way for biometric identity, which happens to be critical to move toward Central Bank Digital Currency.</p>
<p>For years now leading up to this, there was talk about "negative interest rates" but I didn't understand it. Now I do. With this new currency, they can give people money with an expiration date.</p>
<p>It effectively forces them to spend it or lose it, and then it disappears so it doesn't amount to inflation.</p>
<p>It is a wild concept and it's never been done before, not like this.</p>
<p>So... You mention even worse. Keep going. What next!?</p>

        <p>Glad you asked!</p>
<p>Short term: vaccine passports will morph into digital-biometric IDs. Because not everyone has a cellphone, children for example, we will be microchipped. This solves many problems.</p>
<p>Digital-biometric IDs will also usher in the social credit system. Massive unemployment will bring in Universal Basic Income (which I used to support), where we will work for the government instead of the government working for us.</p>
<p>Long term, plans as are laid out by the World Economic Forum Great Reset plan (“Build Back Better”) and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Zero carbon and smart cities for example.</p>
<p>And I say this, someone who 6 months ago, if you talked to me about the Great Reset, conspiracy theory came to mind. It was the vaccine that woke me up. Something wasn’t right about it to me. So I started doing my homework. Now I believe the wheels are in motion for a very dark future, and, as this sub is so appropriately labeled, no new normal.</p>
<p>I hope with all the fibers of my being that I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>I agree with your assessment. (And thanks for sharing that writeup.)</p>
<p>Right now it's nearly impossible to get anyone to see it like we do... Do you think it will always be that way?</p>
<p>Or do you think there will be a turning point where suddenly the majority of people see it for what it is --- so we're not "crazy" anymore -- but maybe it's too late?</p>
<p>Another thing that I see happening is the illusion of difference as the political football is traded between Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
<p>Both parties advance this agenda --- and it seems who holds power depends on whether the next step is something closer to being what you'd expect from a Democrat or what you'd expect from a Republican. (i.e. Democrat = taxes, Republican = war, etc.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you know if there's a timeline anywhere that tracks key points? After a while it becomes too much to keep in mind at once. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here's one component of the puzzle if you didn't already know.</p>
<p>In September 2019, the Fed began intervention in the repo markets. (i.e. due to a problem in repurchase agreements between large banks -- JUST LIKE 2008 only this time it was global and a much bigger problem. Literally two days later Trump signed an executive order that accelerated vaccine development and created the "Influenza Task Force" which we knew later as the Covid-19 Task Force. (Different from anything before because it brought together the heads of all the state departments including Homeland Security, etc.)</p>
<p>I outline this here, with links for reference: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/m9llze/how_the_repo_market_crisis_of_sept_2019_executive/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/m9llze/how_the_repo_market_crisis_of_sept_2019_executive/</a></p>
<p>I also outlined how the mid century population boom increased the percentage of people who are elderly -- creating a giant bubble of people who die more easily due to old age. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lx4jtb/from_baby_boomers_to_death_boomers_why_most/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/lx4jtb/from_baby_boomers_to_death_boomers_why_most/</a></p>
<p>The summary for that is -- what do you get 80 years after a population boom, if life expectancy is \~79 years? From Baby Boomers to Death Boomers.</p>
<p>This is interesting too:</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/22/the-old-lady-who-swallowed-a-fly">https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/22/the-old-lady-who-swallowed-a-fly</a></p>
<p>And the weird "leaked email" from Canada is also interesting, because it came out in Oct 2020 but things keep happening that it warned about.</p>
<p>I hope you're wrong, too, but we both know you're not. :-/</p>
<p>It's possible we are slightly off in one detail or another, but the BIG PICTURE is absolutely dystopian.</p>
<p>I'm afraid it will be too late to stop by the time enough people understand it for what it is, and god knows they are doing everything they can to keep us focused on divisive issues so we aren't able to united as an economic class (which is what we all have in common -- we work for a living versus those who don't have to.)</p>

        <p>I do think it’s too late. Again, I hope I’m wrong. I hope for the best but am preparing mentally for the worst. I was just reading this <a href="https://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/mxltzg/_/gvpzdj2/?context=1">comment</a> which I think is excruciatingly accurate and points out why it’s too late. Dystopian indeed. </p>
<p>For me, Dems/Repubs: same difference. One party doing the bidding of corporations and working against us. I read recently, “politicians are selected, not elected”. True for all Western democracies imo. Puppets for the Globalists. </p>
<p>Thanks for the links! I’ll check them out. More for me to learn.</p>

        <p>Because of the mid century population boom (which was global), there will be "more deaths than ever" for the next 20 years. It's just math. People don't live forever, our population growth jumped from 750k a year to 3 million a year \~80 years ago. (It ramped up quickly.)</p>
<p>Because we aren't increasing the number of hospitals to account for this large number of older people, hospitals will be saturated every year. They will keep people terrified, and just like the "War on Terrorism" it will take a decade before it wears out on enough people.</p>
<p>By then it will be too late.</p>
<p>Keep up the fight, brother. Better we go out fighting than bowing down, just like it says in that comment you linked!</p>

        <p>Its all terrifying but right now the vaccine is what upsets me most.  The rest of the tracking / digital currency / 5g iot related stuff is inevitable unfortunately - but do not make me inject an untested new technology ie poison to get there..  and hopefully there will be some resistance and in turn checks and balances vs the other new technologies that are on their way.</p>

        <p>I feel exactly the same way. Digital tyranny, ok. Well not ok, but you know what I mean. But not the vaccine. That’s where I draw the line. </p>
<p>You might find this <a href="https://reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lx0qlg/why_you_should_care_about_not_having_a_vaccine/">comment</a> interesting because the redditor points out that it won’t matter if you’re vaccinated or not ultimately for the biometric IDs. </p>
<p>If they succeed with implementing the biometric ID, then maybe they’ll back off with the vaccination. </p>
<p>I do think they have a number in their head though for how many people they need vaccinated and they need to reach it to save face. My hope is that when they reach that number they’ll back off. But this might just be wishful thinking.</p>

        <p>People keep saying that they should get it cause they are old and have health problems. I would probably have the opposite strategy and think it would be more dangerous to a person who already has problems and who is older. </p>
<p>Plus it's supposedly the old and infirm that they want to eliminate first because of SSI &amp; SSD.</p>

<p>WRONG </p>
<p>Your friend/mentor willingly took the jab. ITS ON HIM </p>
<p>If he had been forced and held down and jabbed, Id be on your side but he willingly consented. its on him - EVERYTHING that happens now and in the future.  </p>
<p>We need to be honest with ourselves about this. We can play both sides. People are free moral agents and have autonomy over their lives. If they willingly choose to subject themselves to an experimental vaccine, they have ZERO sympathy from me - whether friend, foe or family</p>
