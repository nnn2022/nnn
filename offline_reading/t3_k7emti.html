        <p>This was their goal. To destablize the country. Get kids to commit suicide from their oppressive regime. Yuri Bezmenov talks about this. Highly reccommend people looking him up on YouTube.</p>

        <p>Yup. I'm dealing with this now with my 6 year old granddaughter. She has been living with my husband and I since she was 21 months old. At the age of 3, she was diagnosed with PTSD, OTD, OCD, anxiety and trust issues. She had zero stability in her life until she came to live with me and my husband. She does not like change and the only way she knows how to deal with it is regressing to that of a 2 to 3 year old behavior wise. Things were going great for her up until schools closed down in March. She was behaving like a 5 year old should about 90% of the time. Then it all started back up again. The after care program she goes to opened up full time for school aged kids for essential workers. Which helped, until they had to shut down for a week because a teacher tested positive. Now it has been horrible. She started school for 1 month virtually. Then we sent her back since the school gave the parents a choice. Things were okay with her for about a month, when they allowed more kids back. A week later, they made all kids go back for face to face learning because 40 to 50% of the students were failing. Week before Thanksgiving, they shut down for 3 days due to cases rising in the school district here. They just went back this week and shuffled teachers around so the kids that were failing can catch up. So, she only has one of the teachers she had before Thanksgiving. </p>
<p>She was in therapy until March, when her therapist just disappeared. I should probably get her to another one, but the one we were going to, didn't seem like she was helping much anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the long post. But these idiots need to stop messing with kids heads.</p>
