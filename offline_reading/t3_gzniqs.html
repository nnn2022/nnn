    <strong>Any of you not worn a mask at all?</strong>
    <p><p>Not once. Ever since this crisis has raged on for the past few months, I have worn a mask at all. It's not that I haven't taken necessary precautions like washing hands ( I was always assiduous with hand washing before Covid-19 but quite happily ramped it up), or keeping my distance when going out. It's just that I don't think masks are necessary. I haven't gone out of my area much and I haven't gone into crowded or dense areas, where I might need a mask. Of course, wear them if you wish, if you feel it will help. But there is a surreptitious effort to make masks across the board part of the "new normal". Majority of people in my area don't wear masks, but there is a noticeable minority that do.</p></p>

        <p>My workplace is requiring it but I've started taking it off whenever no one is around.</p>
<p>I've never worn one outside of that. I cancelled a doctor's appointment when they said I would need to wear a mask when I come in. I generally avoid any places that say that I need one to come in, I also intend to continue avoiding said places after the restrictions are lifted.</p>

        <p>This is the only time I’ve worn a mask, when I went to get the antibody test. I told myself this is voluntary so I’d have to put my convictions aside. Hell, they didn’t even tell me to put it on til I actually talked to the dr. Other than that I’ve simply been waiting for someone to call me out. Hasn’t happened yet.</p>

        <p>Never did and probably never will. My parents tried to recommend I run with a mask and I was like, “no, and there’s not going to be an argument.” Still today I ran by some people and they immediately “threw up their mask” like it was some shield, which I can understand but it worries me how long this will go on.</p>

        <p>I said this in another thread but:</p>
<p>I won’t use a store/service that requires one. I haven’t been in a grocery store that mandates one; I won’t use Uber/Lyft anymore; and I certainly won’t wear one just because. I didn’t even own one before end of May. </p>
<p>The one exception is flying... in Canada, the airlines mandate a mask on the plane the whole time. I don’t have an option to drive but am trying to live my life / see my family, so I had to fly and to wear one for the flight. I hung it off one ear a lot, while holding a water bottle, and stuck my nose out most of the time it was fully on.</p>

        <p>I was fine with it for the month of April because I thought it was a temporary measure just until we flattened the curve. By the end of April it was very clear that curve had been flattened. In early May, I was like, why are we still doing this? By mid-May I started wearing my mask under my nose, and by Memorial day weekend I quit altogether. Wearing masks is not a permanent solution to a permanent problem (the existence of respiratory viruses). It is an act of desperation when we need every last little percent of slowing for a virulent respiratory disease with a high mortality rate. Now that we know how low the mortality rate is for COVID, it's hard to argue that it has a mortality rate that is worrying for most people. Unfortunately, I have to wear a mask in to work everyday. But if my mask falls off and no one's around to see it, did it actually happen? I can't wait until these ridiculous measures are behind us.</p>

        <p>Nope have not worn a mask once and have not gone into places that demand i wear one. I have a long beard so there's no point in wearing one. I'm not going to wear a mask so someone else can have the illusion of safety.</p>

        <p>I wore one on two occasions, near the start of the whole fiasco. The second time I gave up mid-shopping trip, took it off, and haven’t worn it since. I hated it even when I was trying to do it. I just don’t have any tolerance for it and won’t contribute to the normalization of it. The best way to fight it is by not participating. I’m not denying that masks probably have some degree of potential to be useful; I just feel that whatever small amount of usefulness they may have does not justify the social damage.</p>
<p>I don’t go to stores that require mask use, and will not visit them again until restrictions are lifted. The only exception would be if I were to travel to a state where they’re required to enforce it (as much as I hate it, I don’t want to punish stores for a decision that isn’t their own), but if I do travel, I will try to avoid those states.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty much with you - I wash my hands frequently, give people space when I go out (normal stuff we should have all been doing before anyway) but the masks I just draw a line at. Only places I've worn one so far is at the farmer's market and a local brewery, and that's only because I like to do business with them and want to respect their rules, certainly not because I feel it protects me or I'm protecting anyone else (especially after WHO released a statement saying asymptomatic transmission is rare). I'm a teacher and may have to wear one in the Fall (hope not)...but everywhere else where it's just a recommendation? Definitely not. The mask I do wear is one of those neck gaiter style face coverings, which I feel at least upholds my individuality and dignity to some extent versus the surgical masks.</p>

        <p>I despise them, for several reasons. I can’t get away with completely refusing to wear it, though. I’ve had to use it on two occasions when it was unavoidable. Once while food shopping, and once when I had to go to the post office. Even though this county technically requires mouth coverings when you enter any place of business, there have actually been two places that served me without one: my local dry cleaner (I was the only customer there) and my usual car repair place.</p>

        <p>Never and I have no intention to.</p>
<p>When Costco announced they were instituting mask requirements, I stopped going.</p>
<p>I WFH but mandating mask wearing in the big open spaces we have at the office would be egregious, I will not comply with that.</p>
<p>If it comes down to it, I'll go live elsewhere if I have to.  People need to realize what is at stake and take a stand.  I support people taking personal responsibility - that means wear a mask if it makes you feel better, but you don't get to impose that on everyone else to make yourself feel safer.  There's a balance to be had, and world is going full retard there.  That isn't a world I want to live in.</p>

        <p>Same - haven’t and don’t ever intend to wear one. If my employer starts enforcing it that’s the only way I can see myself being compromised into wearing one, but I’m hopeful they won’t. </p>
<p>What’s your thoughts on the public transport situation as of June 15th? I’m really curious what level of compliance they will get. Anecdotally I’d say maybe only a third of people are wearing them at the moment. </p>

        <p>I know a bloke who drives a bus and he thinks people will just say they have asthma etc. I doubt fines will be taken seriously, especially after the Cummings incident, and I mean, these drivers need to get from A to B or the boss will give them earache, doubt they'll have time to pursue people who don't wear masks. On trains however, I don't know. It seems a lot of people on the tube in London are already wearing them.  I think the general view is it's too little too late and even people who were once wearing them don't see the point of wearing them again. The UK gov have just re-cancelled schools again today, so I assume this'll be another plan they'll just cancel because no one will follow it.</p>
<p>I've only seen one mask here but I'm in very remote area. Heck, I doubt where I live has even had a case, it certainly hasn't spread if it has.</p>

        <p>I haven't. Luckily in Florida most people didn't really buy into the mask hysteria in the first place, and the number of people who are using them appears to be going down in my opinion. I've taken to not visiting stores that require them.</p>

        <p>I wore a mask twice - both times because I was forced to when I was having blood drawn and was too weak to argue about it. (And no, I didn't have the virus. This was a chronic health problem type of thing). I hate it when I'm too weak to be obstinate!</p>

        <p>I wore one half-heartedly once to go grocery shopping. I ended up wearing it like a scarf around my neck instead because it was so annoying - it was a bandanna-style mask. Never again.</p>
<p>Thank god I will be working alone all summer so I don't even have to worry about wearing one!</p>
<p>At some local stores employees are wearing full face shields now. I bought one at the dollar store to wear as a joke to my parents' house because they think this entire shutdown, etc. is ridiculous, too. They've never stopped hugging and kissing us and their grandkids. They're in their 80s and don't want to live their last years in fear and isolated, and as they said, they've lived through worse - war, polio, diphtheria, etc. Nobody shut down for that stuff.</p>

        <p>I haven’t worn one yet. Grocery stores and Target/Walmart don’t require them where I live and I just don’t go to places that require them. The hairdresser that I went to today was a bit upset that I didn’t have one for my child’s haircut, but I feel that she should have mentioned that it was required when I made the appointment. I asked if they provided them and would have worn one if they had given me one. I’m pregnant and will probably have to wear one to the doctors office though, which I will do because I need medical treatment. I really hope that I don’t have to wear one when I give birth though in January. I read a sad article about a lady who had to give birth alone in the hospital and she was only allowed to remove her mask when she had to throw up and when she was having trouble breathing during labor.</p>

<p>Note that I've already had the virus and tested positive for antibodies, yet I'm still somehow required to wear a mask in a lot of situations - even when exerting myself a lot in PT.</p>

        <p>They re required here for most buildings - I've only worn one when going grocery shopping. An interesting thing I noticed is that while they are required at the county level (Kauai HI) the post office had a sign that only said "recommend" (not required) which I think may be because they're federal and it's not required at that level? However when I went in without one it was very tense and the clerk was wearing a mask, gloves AND behind a full sheet of plastic ALONE - i.e. no coworkers</p>

        <p>I have never worn one. Widespread mask usage is preposterous, and it is not based on science. Luckily, I live in Finland where widespread mask usage is not even recommended by the health authorities, let alone mandatory.

I guess I’ll have to wear it in an Uber too so I’m now not going out and am trapped home / trying to schedule things so I can have my partner pick me up. So only when it’s absolutely Necessary and I plan and cancel things accordingly so i don’t have to wear a mask. What a stupid way to live life.</p>

        <p>I’ve only worn one once for a doctors appointment. Fortunately the most I’ve ever seen wearing them at once was about 75% of people in a Walmart at the peak of the lockdown. These days it’s anywhere from 60% to almost zero depending on the place and time of day.</p>

        <p>Preface: my wife (who’s more anti mask than me) does the grocery shopping so she’s been forced to wear them on those occasion due to store requirements here. We prefer our feline and bakery since they’re smaller and don’t fall for this theatre. But we need veggies and meat too.</p>
<p>We started doing contactless pickup to minimize times we needed to use a mask.</p>
<p>I only used it when I went to hospital for something (did not have Covid). I was okay with that.</p>
<p>I have carried a soccer scarf the two times I used the subway here. as a face covering if required. But the train wasn’t that busy so I didn’t bother (I would have though)</p>
<p>Same trip in one store I used the scarf for a couple of minutes. I honestly had to take it off as it just sucked balls. Don’t use a soccer scarf as it’s too heavy. </p>
<p>I’m going to try a bandana next time since it’s a bit thinner but again I’ll only do it if the place is really crowded and at my discretion.</p>
<p>One thing I find so dumb about this is mandatory mask laws just turn into a tax on going out. This is why I’d prefer something I already own as opposed to masks which cost between 50 cents and $1 per use. I’ll be selective with when I use them.</p>

        <p>Haven't bought one. While driving through NM, I did have to put a T-shirt around my face to be allowed to go inside a gas station. That was my one mask wearing incident.</p>

        <p>I've worn a mask for brief moments when I wasn't sure how strictly they'd enforce the mandate. And it wasn't even a mask, just a black bandana.</p>
<p>Why is this NSFW though?</p>
