        <p>Yes, they would. Because it's not about the mortality rate of the disease, it's about the infection rate, total infected people and the handle over the virus as a whole. There's more factors than just "hurr durr deth rate low" which determines the danger of a virus.</p>
<p>For example, there's currently 3 main strains of COVID as a result of mutation. There's over 111,000,000 current infections, around 2,500,000 deaths total and to those who survive are at a decent risk for long-term health conditions, such as what's displayed in this article: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351</a></p>
<p>Just because it doesn't kill at a crazy high rate doesn't mean it's not dangerous. It <em>could</em> kill you, it <em>could</em> give you long term health conditions or effects. I suggest you lose your mentality of "it kills low rate so wat big del?" and quit being an idiot. You're not smarter than this nations virologists, the CDC or other disease researchers. LEGITIMATE disease researchers.</p>

        <p>&rt;There's over 111,000,000 current infections</p>
<p>Actually those are just confirmed infections. In a highly contagious respiratory virus there will be much more infections since the vast majority of people who contract covid show mild symptoms or none at all (which doesn't always warrant a test, so they remain unconfirmed). On october 5 2020 the WHO estimated more than 750 million people worldwide have already been infected with covid. It's most likely over a billion now, 4 months later.</p>
<p>&rt;It could kill you</p>
<p>It could. But the chances are extremely slim. I'm young so I'm actually 5 more likely to die from the flu than covid. I'll take my chances.</p>
<p>&rt; it could give you long term health conditions or effects</p>
<p>This is even more slim to happen to me, because long term effects mostly occured only on people who actually had to be hospitalized for covid. If I ever get infected I'll most likely remain asymptomatic or get mild symptoms.</p>

<p>I highly doubt those numbers are accurate, but you can provide me with a link to the source, if you'd like. And if those numbers are accurate, you're basically saying we should be MORE worried about the infection rates, transmissibility, and naturally, the death rate? Way to argue the "not so bad" case.</p>
<p>To the contrary of your argument about young people being at less risk, you are wrong. Old people are much more likely to die because of obvious reasons. But articles by credible sources will explain the devastatingly under-estimated effects of COVID on young adults. </p>

<p>I'm not here to do your homework. If you actually wanted to see the data you would simply search on google: "the who estimates 750 million covid" and you would get the sources pop up right away, but you aren't even capable of that.</p>
<p>Anyone with two brain cells knows by now that the death rate isn't 2%. Hell, with all the needless testing they do, even the CFR is only 2.5% and dropping. You don't even know the difference between IFR and CFR and you claim you're the one who listens to science.</p>

        <p>WHO said that in October of last year. If those numbers were even close to being accurate, we certainly would be hearing more about it in updates. Probably around billions would be infected? Would it be a fair estimate to say around 3-4 billion would be infected at that point?</p>
<p>It was never proved officially, but rather a guess. Something you people seem to like very often, which is why I'm not surprised you took a liking to it, regardless of the fact it came from a REAL medical organization.</p>
<p>And by the current, hard evidence we have right now, it is absolutely around 2-3 percent. If you do the math between recorded infected and recorded deaths, you'll find the death rate is currently, according to data I've retrieved from the John Hopkins COVID-19 Tracker, standing at 2.21% mortality.</p>
<p>See how far actual research goes?</p>

<p>No virus can ever even infect 100% of the population...herd immunity kicks in long before that. Not even half the human population will get covid, (most likely only a fourth of the human population actually will).</p>
<p>&rt;It was never proved officially, but rather a guess.</p>
<p>That's basically what the IFR is, an estimate... 
It's impossible to know the correct number of all cases in a highly contagious respiratory virus, because like I said, the vast majority of them are asymptomatic or mild, which don't always warrant a test. This is why you couldn't get tested for the flu, unless you had severe enough symptoms to be hospitalized. It's incredibly ignorant to take the CFR and call it the death rate.</p>

        <p>And if only 1/4th of humanity could possibly get COVID, then within a week after that 750 million estimate, we would've been WELL past this pandemic by now, now wouldn't we? Oh, but it's not over. Nah, people are still dying, survivors are living with effects after the fact, and more poor souls and dumb idiots are getting infected.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>An estimate is going to be backed by research and evidence, not just blind guesses, so any estimate worth it's salt is going to be around or exact in it's guess. So...basically...what we're saying now...is the death rate is around....2-3%...yes?</p>
<p>And while a lot of cases are asymptomatic, or mild, it only makes it more dangerous, causing it to spread more and more amongst people and their family, their co-workers, their children, their friends and pets. Thus causing more mutations in the virus likely to occur. And, you are aware, yes, that mild or asymptomatic cases CAN still kill a person, yes? It's not like "ah, you're asymptomatic, you're fiiiiiiine.". Because that's what an idiot would think. Remember that article I showed you about that 17 year old boy? He was 6'6'', a baseball player, full of energy. Ah, but then he caught covid, mild case, basically nothin', and then he began getting heart arrhythmias, irregular heart beat, chronic fatigue, night sweats, insomnia. Then he was diagnosed with viral myocarditis. No treatment for that.</p>

<p>The fact that for every case that gets recorded, there are ten more is actually a great thing because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It shows how mild this virus is that the vast majority of people don't even really get sick from contracting it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shows the IFR is extremely low...and along the lines of the annual flu. If a billion people get a respiratory virus and only 1 or 2 million of them die...that shows what it is...a highly contagious but mild virus, like any other mild respiratory virus humans have dealt with since our existence. But nope...you cannot fathom this, because the nefarious media and its quacks have done nothing but feed misinformation and distort everything while playing dumb. So the narrative is that this is a magical alien supervirus that no one knows anything about, as if this virus wasn't a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus... hardly anything enigmatic.</p>

        <p>A report just came out the China virus didn’t spread at the super bowl where you morons proclaim no one was wearing masks. Research came out proving MAGA rallies did not cause the China virus to spread. But masks work? You’re brainwashed. More studies proving masks don’t work </p>
