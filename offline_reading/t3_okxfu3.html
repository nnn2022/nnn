    <strong>We Need To Check Ourselves</strong>
    <p><p>So I have a good friend in the medical field and have been discussing these things. He's pretty much a data scientist, though his undergrad was in Chinese Med.</p>
<p>We've been going over the assertions made here and a lot don't hold up.</p>
<p>I do give it 90 percent that there is something crazy going on, and don't doubt that there is a strong deepstate push to remove the reproductive capacity of the population... (don't want to go down a rabbit hole, but the big push toward gender confusion seems part of this)</p>
<p>Still, when we make fallacious assertions, it only hurts us.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on critical thinking.  So let's do that.</p>
<p>For example, someone wrote that there were no variants until the vaccine... and I accepted it out of hand.  But... it isnt true. Alpha, Beta, and a few others showed up well before the vaccine back in early to late 2020.  "Vaccine" started some time in 2021, non?</p>
<p>We need to make sure the things we say are true.</p>
<p>And for that we need to question ourselves.</p>
<p>We need to give in our minds some percentage of possibility that we are wrong, that the mainstream is right...</p>
<p>If we don't its just the same old BS conversation that the elites have created to manufacture this cold civil war between the red and blues...</p>
<p>We need to check ourselves or we wreck ourselves.</p>
<p>I give this assertion upwards of 90 percent likelihood.</p>
<p>Anyone disagree?  Discuss.</p>
<p>Edit:  was worried I'd get downvoted to oblivion and am glad to see I started a bit of discussion.  Getting to be too many to address everyone.  Looks like vaccine trials started in March 2020, so it could still be responsible for variants.</p>
<p>Reddit is so useful, even if it is apparently run by pedophile enablers and the mods of the biggest subs are all explitives I won't use right now.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  k.  The downvoting on a concern and a request for discussion around it is making me lose hope in the community. </p>
<p>Although, I probably needed a better title. Guessing there is a kneejerk reaction toward being doubted.</p>
<p>Edit 3:  number of upvotes much closer to what i expected from the culture of the sub. Thanks for living up to my expectations, NNN.</p>
<p>Someone also gave me a super important link</p>
<p>https://corona-ausschuss.de/en/documents/</p>
<p>A really robust study in proper form that shows the obvious.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah. We don't know what is actually going on, who is acting in good faith, who is duped, if or if not there really is a conspiracy to prolong the pandemic through the shots, or of it might be population control.</p>

        <p>Totally.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I work with a doctor who has a couple of practices and also consults with some practices in London. One of the clinics he mentioned to me has 36 physicians on staff, and 35 of them refused the vaccine. And this is coming from someone I personally know.</p>
<p>It's enough to add credibility to some of these other claims being made.</p>

        <p>Right?   Cuz they aren't fully treated and if you resist yourself to do what you need to to survive (assuming you won't be asymptomatic....) then the vaccine is useless. Cuz i don't want to change how my system functions...</p>

        <p>Phase 3 of trials started July 27th 2020, participants of the trial received there second doze November 13 2020, the alpha, beta, and delta variant was first detected in December of 2020, so technically they could have emerged from vaccines, especially since trials were conducted throughout the world, but I do agree that no matter where we get information everything must be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

        <p>That’s when more people started to get it, but it was available to the first people in late December. Before that, politicians and celebrities got it to brag around late November. It was actually “publicly available” but not “widely available” early November. There were reports it was already created by at least July, maybe earlier, don’t remember that part exactly correct, and was awaiting EUA.</p>

        <p>OP you’re right in that people should have evidence in the form of university studies - or at least explain their position using logic/critical thinking. </p>
<p>Problem is, most of the pro vaccine medical studies are written by universities that have partnerships with biopharma companies.  Give me one, bet I’ll find some greased palms. </p>
<p>No one cares what your doctor friend is saying. In fact, I’ve said from the get, highly educated people are being drug into deep intellectual water. They’ll be left their, with no credibility when this is finished.</p>
<p>This is a case where street smarts trumps intellect ALL day. In fact, education is being used to perpetrate their crimes, cover it up. Why would I trust an educated person who initially told me to trust the science?</p>
<p>Respect what your saying but, would argue your friend is actually a poor source of information. Would rather take medical advice from a homeless person.</p>

        <p>Discredit them. Ask them for sources. Make the link between the study and the biopharma companies, if they’re citing a university study. If they’re citing mainstream, figure out how many advertising dollars biopharma companies are spending in advertising. It’s not that hard.</p>

<p>John Hopkins is recommending vaccines for 12-15 year olds, and get a ton of money from Phizer AND the NIH, who likely is partially responsible for all this. </p>
<p>Or, get better friends. Honestly. If he’s telling people to get vaccinated and they have severe long term consequences, you want to be associated with him?</p>
<p>He’s a prescription drug dealer, not a doctor. I know a doctor - a nationally recognized cardiac surgeon - who privately has told me not to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>He isnt citing anything, but poking holes in my methodology. Still looking for sources beyond reproach. </p>
<p>He isn't saying to get vaccinated. The conversation started when I asked if he was. I then sent some stuff that he was able to put holes in really easily.</p>
<p>And again, he studied Chinese Medicine.  Dude is much broader ranged than you are giving credit for. </p>
<p>The thing is he makes no assertions. Just questions mine. Which is what you want in a friend.</p>

        <p>He’s saying that Covid mutated before vaccines were around, so variants are not specifically caused by the vaccines. Sound logic.</p>

        <p>Actually, so long as he is not drawing conclusions himself? Sound logic. I’ve done a ton of research, but the question is even framed wrong.</p>
<p>A vaccine is a dead piece of virus your body builds natural immunity to. They’ve been around and we know what to expect.</p>
<p>This isn’t legally a vaccine, it’s gene therapy. No one knows what the fuck is gonna happen when a virus interacts with spike proteins vs antibodies. </p>
<p>My guess is that it would mutate but just a guess. If he’s making any statements, he’s wrong. If he’s questioning your logic? Probably a good friend.</p>

        <p>Don't hold him in too high regard. Look at him as just a guy. My sister and her husband have PhDs but never ask for my sources when talking about certain topics, they just tell me my thinking is stupid or a load of crap, when all I stated specifically was I have a lot of questions regarding historical events.</p>
<p>My wife has a graduates degree and admitted the experience was practically the only thing that was valuable. I learned to be critical after being duped throughout the years after waking up. There's a podcast that I listen to regularly, The Last American Vagabond hosted by Ryan Christian. He does some good work. You can send your friend the links he provides for LITERALLY every show. That's why I like and listen to him.</p>

        <p>I have the utmost respect for Bret Weinstein from the Dark Horse podcast. He careful about every word that comes out of his mouth. Any conclusions that he comes to are essentially irrefutable with the current available data. Any unverifiable claims he offers as possibilities are both logical and with the clause that it is purely conjecture.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach is that it limits discussion and potential collaboration that may lead to breakthroughs  in the search for truth. Unfortunately, anything not backed by evidence will be used as ammunition for the other side, even if proven true in the future.</p>
<p>The only way to balance this, I think, is to have these discussions in private until there is overwhelming supportive evidence is found to support one's claims. This is mostly relevant to public figures and thought leaders, but something we should all keep in mind.</p>

<p>Yes, people will downvote because you're questioning the questioners, but you aren't in any way wrong to do so.</p>
<p>As for keeping an eye on making sure we are "In the right" with our statements you are correct. Everyone should do so, especially in this sub. </p>

        <p>Disagree at this point.  I do understand your point, though.  It’s certain the msm is in league with those responsible for this pandemic, and they must be held accountable as well.  There’s shrinking room for lack of clarity any longer.  If you haven’t learned all there is to know about the legal battle led by Reiner Fullerich, I suggest you begin.</p>

<p>We do need to reach out to people that have been brainwashed, and you can't do that siccessfully with hypeebolix claims. I was quite embarrassed to realize that there were variants cropping up well before the vaccine was administered. </p>

        <p>I think the main problem is most people are just starting to wake up. OP, was last year the beginning of your awakening?</p>
<p>My wife and I have together been awake the better part of the last 7 years. We predicted every step of their (elites) agenda from Operation Lockstep from the Rockefeller foundation. </p>
<p>I woke her up in 2014. I have been awake since 2006 but I also learned to vet sources and wait for claims to be confirmed.</p>
<p>If you're just waking up you and others are at a severe disadvantage since there's no time to vet everything you see and hear. You have no clue the weapons being used on you, from occult symbolism and subconscious programming to the schooling you were brought up in, academia being the worst of all of it since it teaches you to not trust your own senses.</p>
<p>This sub has changed for the worst in regards to accurate information being shared. I was here at 5.7k and we posted peer-reviewed studies all the time refuting claims from the msm, now it's mostly memes. It's great that we're so big now but if you are expecting better behavior you're setting yourself up to be disappointed.</p>

        <p>I don't know that I am awake in more than spurts, but I was raised with talk of the end times, Illuminati, Masons, etc.</p>
<p>Strong distrust for government in my family, and likely a lot of Slavic families. </p>
<p>Oddly, my parents seem to have fallen asleep. My dad fell for the Trump psyop (at least I think he was doing his job and the cold civil war went slightly hot with BLM riots and "insurrection") and I think my mom has honestly gotten a lot better. She was very fire and Brimstone when I was growing up (which turned my oldest brother into an SJW. Sad cuz he was always the most cerebrally intelligent guy I know, and largely still is, though you are 100 percent on about academia)</p>
<p>You're right about reddit culture and internet culture at large. People are ridiculous. Was just on facebook explaining how Feminism and BLM can be harmful and my buddy from ten years ago whom I met in South Korea (big digression, used to teach) and he was wondering if it was like this then.</p>
<p>No, we had a measured conversation on the subject with some lesbian friends and they weren't hateful like people are now.  I have a strong memory of him saying shit then that would get him castrated now. </p>
<p>But I also am quite wary of falling into a confirmation bias trap. I have been through a lot of spiritual traditions to get out of my mom's Christian insanity growing up. Joseph Campbell more or less saved me.  Hinduism is amazing and really aligns with Christianity in many ways, but with some much deeper thinkers over the millenia.  In my not so humble opinion.</p>
<p>My mom discovered Gene Scott, God's Angry Man, and I think that helped her recovery from the inverse devil worship of my youth (fire and brimstone theology is pretty much worship of the devil for all the power it gives him)</p>
<p>The guy has some super interesting history of the 10 lost tribes and their migrations. Apparently the Scythians, Celts, and a lot of other tribes were descendents of Abraham, as shown by the names of various landmarks (for instance the Dnieper river, he claims, is named for the tribe of Dan.)</p>
<p>And he breaks down the stories in really interesting ways. I don't care for his lectures, but my mom talks a lot more about how God messes with us rather than the devil. In fact I never really hear her mention the devil anymore and I think that's a good thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this isn't TMI.  The evidence of our sense is primary. Academia wants you to memorize shit that they write so they can keep their jobs and positions in the hierarchy.</p>

        <p>Yeah. If it is creating the variants, since the goal of the mrna thing is to get mrna into your cells to cover them with proteins so that the body will recognize the spike proteins....</p>
<p>Then it may actually have a trojan horse effect in which the spike protein is identified as self. Which would lead to a different evolutionary pathway than a scorched earth policy, and likely lessen symptoms while increasing susceptibility. </p>
<p>Don't have a degree in biology. So i could be off in my understanding.</p>

        <p>I strongly agree. I am considered, “a conspiracy theorist.” However, I just want whatever the truth is. No agenda, just finding out what is really going on. I don’t want to contort the information to fit my narrative. I want truth to be my narrative not the other way around. </p>
<p>We do not know long term effects, time will tell. </p>
<p>I agree we need a strong foundation in science, statistical analysis, and most importantly, the truth whatever that may be. In support or against our concerns of this vaccine.</p>

        <p>&rt; For example, someone wrote that there were no variants until the vaccine... and I accepted it out of hand. But... it isnt true. Alpha, Beta, and a few others showed up well before the vaccine back in early to late 2020. "Vaccine" started some time in 2021, non?</p>
<p>There was no variant <em>hype</em> before the vaccines. That's why it makes no sense. All these scary variants date back to 2020, the Alpha one (UK) was first seen in Bulgaria I believe around March 2020. Why does the media start to hype them now that we have vaccines?</p>
<p>Is that really all the fallacious assertions you found?</p>
<p>EDIT that said yes, really good attitude. Think for yourself and doublecheck everything, always.</p>

        <p>There will always be the possibility of being wrong.  Nobody here is claiming to be infallable and perfect.  However, the shear number of times we've been right about everything that is happening, and right about what comes next far outweights the number of time we've been wrong.</p>
<p>And, why worry about any of that, when "the other side" still can't do basic things like provide proof that any of the things they are advocating have any positive effect on health.  Hell, I don't think they've actually proven Covid actually exists yet.</p>

        <p>You have a point, but it is not "them or us" situation. It is clear the MSM stories are inconsistent and that can be proved easily, and I agree that on this sub there are stupid ant false claims floating here and there. We have false claims in both tables.</p>
<p>Challenge is that there is not much solid facts to build on. The data has been censored and obfuscated to the point of being unusable. Even scientific publications suffer from this nowadays. I honestly don't know what is the full truth, but I have certainly seen a lot of false claims in MSM.</p>

<p>It is hard to get over biases, especially because when everyone believes something it is my nature to question the shit out of it, especially where the bigwigs are concerned and when there is clear propaganda...</p>
<p>Bret Weinstein points out that the reason why they might be doing this fuckery is because there is a danger of "free riders" making it so that we don't get herd immunity, but also that the profit motive is huge behind it. </p>

<p>Excellent podcast.  Makes a lot of sense. Isn't sensational. Recognizes what may be the benefits of the mrna gene therapy, explains it, and explains potential problems.</p>
<p>I don't think it is wise to say that it will make you infertile. But it is also unwise to ignore the possibility.</p>

        <p>This is what it takes, we have to disseminate all the information we come across. If we stick to the facts and don't theorize on the grand implications of this whole thing we still arrive at these injections being both unsafe and ineffective.</p>
<p>Both the alternative community and MSM can be simultaneously wrong. The alternative community can just be alllll over the fuckin place, while MSM generally has a uniform message between all outlets. That makes them appear to have more credibility, even though it's just downright suspicious. For that reason though we've got to be a cool and collected bunch.</p>

        <p>Yeah. And I am trying to think of it from their perspective. Which I think it is important to try and put ourselves in the mainstream reality tunnel in order to check ourselves... so to speak.</p>
<p>They might think these variants are coming out due to the virus having more time in the unvaccinated, and therefore mutating to affect the vaccinated.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps having your own cells produce spike proteins tricks your body into welcoming in the virus and allows it to mutate. </p>

        <p>I’m a data scientist as well and you are right that a lot of information here is definitely not factual. But I’d argue a majority of the other sides information isn’t factual either. Not to mention the data is being manipulated hard for the other side, which biases me away from it. There isn’t any data that shows that masks, lockdowns and social distancing really had much of an effect on the pandemic. There are just so many cofounding variables (like the fact that being in contact with someone while showing any symptoms at all is borderline illegal in some places) and it doesn’t look like anyone is really even attempting to decouple them. </p>
<p>Also, did you say your friend majored in Chinese medicine? Like the whole five viscera and six entrails Chinese medicine? Is that a thing?</p>

        <p>Hells yeah it is.  </p>
<p>I spent a year in school for it myself, but didn't finish cuz it wasn't gonna be gainful employment, really.  So working toward PHD in Ed, planning to start up an online English teaching business. </p>
<p>But yeah, the Chinese System is incredible. Not very viable in a modern hit it and quit it approach to medicine.  Much more effective in a retreat setting.  You have to understand the sensations of your body and mind and their indications... which sounds harder than it is. And also, change habits and such.</p>
<p>Heebs are good though, and a session of tuina or acupuncture can really effect things.... but a deeper shift in the approach to health is qhere the money is at for me. </p>
<p>I could go on, but these are just my observations. </p>
<p>I love the maps of the body the most. The 6 conformations and the way the channels follow paths within the body that are perceptible, as well as regular (as in each starting and ending on fingers and toes...) </p>
<p>Anywho. Thanks for catching that. I feel it makes him a much more credible person to talk to. </p>
<p>6 zang and 6 fu organs, the fu starting at the mouth and ending at the anus, (those which drain and do not store, the yang organs) and zang being heart, liver, kidney, pericardium, spleen...</p>
<p>5 phases (elements) though.  And five spirits, each living in one of tge zang organs, exclusing the pericardium, which I guess the viscera must be the zang then. </p>
<p>Its been a few years and Im rambling.</p>

        <p>Your friend is correct. Lot of bad info being thrown around on either side.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that you will fight a loosing battle when trying to attack the "medical / health" aspects of this narrative.</p>
<p>Id much rather point at the conglomerate of institutes, companies, politics, universites and others that clearly push a pretty obvious agenda.</p>

        <p>Like, take WEF / Klaus Schwab.</p>
<p>You can show that to people and they be like:</p>
<p>"But he is right, Neoliberalism is bad. Shareholder Capitalism is bad. Stakeholder Capitalism sounds good"</p>
<p>And they are right. But, somehow they cant comprehend that the WEF consists of the 1.200 biggest companies in the world and therefore the biggest winners of Shareholder Capitalism.</p>
<p>So, the very same people who are responsible for many of todays problems are the ones presenting supposed solutions now. Im not buying any of their shit, but others do...</p>
<p>Even straight up wierd stuff like "We need digitalized vaccine cards." "Industrie 4.0 is the way." &lt;-&rt; "Cyber Attacks are the biggest threat to humanity." "A proper cyber attack will be 10 times worse than Corona."</p>
<p>Coming from the same circle 100% contradicting itself, they just dont see any issue with that. Or rationalize it as: "But this guy didnt know what that guy said..."</p>
<p>Im really lost as to why they do it. I know some people have to much cognitive dissonance and will opt out of the debate when its too much for them to bear. Some understand it, but would much rather be on the "winners" side. For the rest... I really dont know.</p>

        <p>I don't know about WEF and Schaub or Shareholder vs Stakeholder.  You got a link?</p>
<p>I am super into GME, so this is definitely stuff I wanna understand.</p>
<p>&rt;Im really lost as to why they do it. I know some people have to much cognitive dissonance and will opt out of the debate when its too much for them to bear. Some understand it, but would much rather be on the "winners" side. For the rest... I really dont know.</p>
<p>The more the hypnotists can get people to contradict themselves and take opposing viewpoints, the more of a hold they have on the hypnosis, I think.</p>
<p>And then people not taken in get cognitive dissonance and stand down, or push back and get demonized.</p>
<p>But these propensities are inherent in all of us. I probably have some inconsistent view points, and may contradict myself... sometimes I may refuse to see it, but if really shown I pride myself on being humble enough to accept being wrong and change my view.</p>
<p>What the hypnosis is encouraging is the refusal to accept fallibility reflex, and they also have two dispositions (red and blue) that they've set up as enemies and are working both sides into an irrational furor. </p>
<p>A lot of the behavior they want comes naturally. But they have methods by which they encourage and implant it. </p>
<p>Of course, who "they" is is an impossible thing to really know, and it probably sounds more reasonable if you don't attribute it to a conscious plan, but rather to greed.  Like, sensationalism and ignorance get media companies more money, therefore it's a field day for those things on their property....</p>
<p>I kinda tend to think that the deepstate is behind it though. There's other ways for the media to make money than ruining the nation. 🥺</p>

        <p>&rt;I don't know about WEF and Schaub or Shareholder vs Stakeholder.  You got a link?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/">WEF is the World Economic Forum</a>. Its the worlds biggest lobby  and consists of great corporations such as Coca Cola, Monsanto, Unilever, Microsoft, Blackrock...  It is run by Klaus Schwab who published a book early into the crisis "Covid-19: The Great Reset."</p>
<p>They are the main pushers behind the ideas of industrialisation and digitalization.</p>
<p>They do so through various means, for example their <a href="https://www.younggloballeaders.org/">Young Global Leaders</a> program.</p>
<p>Basically, they run the world. But people just dont want to entertain the thought, because we are supposedly democracy and the likes. But guess what, all political leaders of power mingle with the WEF.</p>
<p>Their ideas arent questioned but Agendas being pushed.</p>
<p>Really just read into their stuff and ask yourself whether they TRULY work towards a world you would want to live in or if its all a charade to further their own goals.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Shareholder capitalism is what we have now, where companies are supposed to have their main goal in enriching their shareholders.</p>
<p>Stakeholders are everyone who has a stake in a company, that includes also the customer and the workforce and the likes. So the idea would be that soon we will see big companies care about their employees and their customers, environment and the likes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But honestly, if you believe anything these power hungry suckers tell you....</p>

        <p>You're an educated sheep, sorry. </p>
<p>Please tell me the proof of ANY variant.  There's not even proof of covid 19. There is none, its never been isolated and never been proven by way of kochs postulates which is the accepted method of verifying a virus or disease. </p>
<p>You've heard from a government approved source that there are variants. And you're not bright enough to understand. Regurgitating a government approved narrative doesn't make you smart, it makes you a parrot</p>
