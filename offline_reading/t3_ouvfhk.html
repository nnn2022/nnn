    <strong>Hypothetical future</strong>
    <p><p>Let's imagine for a moment that Charles Hoffe's warning is true (60% of vaccinated will be dead within 3 years): what do you think would happen to societies in this scenario?</p>
<p>At one point, the deaths will be too many to be faked (covid variants or something else), also because people will eventually notice that only vaccinated are dying.
What would happen then to all those politicians and media who pushed for the vaccination? There will be more than 1 billion deaths in the world, I don't think people would accept a democratic confrontation with the responsibles, especially the vaccinated: what would they have to lose after all? They'd probably drag them out their homes .Also, will the vaccine producers be dragged in front of a new Nuremberg tribunal or will the penal shield be still valid?</p>
<p>However, the vaccinated would be walking deads, they wouldn't be allowed to drive a vehicle for example, for the risk of dying at the wheel while on a highway.
Also, that would make all countries with high vaccination rates extremely exposed to enemies: in three years, military forced would be halved, at best.
For the unvaccinated it wouldn't be a victory tho: beside losing beloved people who decided to get the shot, a sudden halving of population is a societal collapse. Virtually the majority of medics would be dead. Transporters, Employers, Technicians (for example for running a nuclear plant) and so on.</p>
<p>I think that Hoffe might have been sensationalistic and what he says likely won't happen, this scenario is more like a discussion for sci-fi fans.. a "what if" universe.</p></p>

        <p>This is exactly what I’ve been pondering lately. More specifically, I have been thinking about the absolute timing of the release of the film ‘Infinity war’ where half the universe was killed off and then we got the film ‘endgame’. We know Hollywood spreads propaganda and even predictive programming, so in my eye it seemed they were sending a message to those who could see. 
 Also to answer your question, I feel what would happen is the govs of the world would simply introduce another planned false flag and use that to distract everybody further and then bring in martial law. They would never let power slip.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about Infinity War lately too. After it came out, the whole "Thanos was right" meme started spreading. Wondering if that may have started the whole shebang.</p>

        <p>Yeah honestly the state of the world is pretty sad. Now we can see clearly who is a sheep. It's like 9/11 but even greater because the effect of this particular psyop is over a long period of time.</p>
<p>For example, ever heard the saying, "9/11 is the best litmus test"? Something like that. Maybe its from Loose Change (9/11 docu) or perhaps from something else. But yeah 9/11 was a litmus test to see who could think critically and who couldn't lol. Now multiply that by 100 and we have the covid psyop.</p>

        <p>I don't have much input on the vaccine itself. But there is an obvious Agenda going on surrounding the vaccines. Multiple nations are talking about/implementing "vaccine" passports or digital ID.</p>
<p>The thing I don't understand is, they could have, internationally, deployed a digital ID system without all this BS chaos.</p>
<p>Globalization is also a topic between multiple nations. I'm not particularly against globalization, but I don't understand why they're destroying nations democracies to accomplish this.</p>
<p>Whether globalization, a digital ID, addressing food production issues, these are all things that could have been addressed publicly. They could have all been addressed as an international Agenda. Which is the goal of the 2030 Agenda. The Great Reset. On the surface these things aren't bad, and should be discussed openly. </p>
<p>It's because of this, these topics that should be openly discussed, that they're going to great lengths to avoid speaking about, that has me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>With what's been going on in the world, specifically our allied nations, I fully believe the US (this administration) has submitted to the WEF/UN agenda, at the cost of our democracy. </p>
<p>I don't think any of this is about a pandemic or a vaccine. I think the vaccines main purpose is to divide and document. </p>
<p>There is literally nothing rational coming from the WH or the CDC regarding these vaccines.</p>

        <p>The reason to destroy each individual nations democracy is to brainwash the people of the WORLD and have them convinced that its dangerous to let individual nations be... individual, thus we need a one world government.</p>

        <p>I have difficulty believing Hoffe's prediction. Did he present any hard data other than the D-dimer tests? These tests are know to be prone to false positives, and a high value from them is not always a sign of clotting. For example infection/inflammation, and plain old age, are apparently common reasons for high D-dimer values.</p>
<p>Also, him saying that capillary damage is permanent was weird to me. Your body can straight up create new capillaries to replace damaged ones.</p>
