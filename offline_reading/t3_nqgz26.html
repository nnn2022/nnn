    <strong>As things return to pre-covid normal, do NOT forget the names of every. Single. Doomer. That supported lockdowns and encouraged snitching - Those are the ones that would send you off to the camps in 1930's Germany</strong>
    <p><p>It seems that things across the U.S. are starting to return to "pre-covid normal." You know, the way it should've always been. </p>
<p>The rest of the world is still struggling - Australia, Canada, and my small country. </p>
<p>I just wanted to remind you all that if and when things get better do NOT forget the names of every single person big and small that supported lockdowns, censored people, and encouraged snitching.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about the people that were just scared. I'm talking about the people that shut you down for having a dissenting opinion, encouraged snitching, etc. </p>
<p>These people are truly a danger to you and to society, and unfortunately there's not much we can do about it. </p>
<p>Next time the media creates some "end of the world" scare tactic - which they will - these will be the first to fall in line and do exactly what those in power want them to do. </p>
<p>If that means staying at home and wearing a mask, they'd do it. But they would also gladly snitch on you for not wearing a mask while driving a car alone, send you to a re-education camp, and ban you from society. They do not care about you. These are the virtue signalers and manipulated ones. </p>
<p>Don't forget the politicians that encouraged lockdown. They will say whatever is popular in the moment to re-gain everyone's votes. </p>
<p>Don't forget those that censored you. The next time there's a "crisis," they will censor you again. </p>
<p><strong>I is abundantly clear that lockdowns were extremely detrimental and did hardly anything to benefit. Within 10-20 years, this will be the common opinion.</strong> </p>
<p>Don't believe me? Check the history books. Many Nazi's escaped and lived among the rest. After just 2 decades, they had effectively created completely new lives for themselves and blended into society. </p>
<p>You can also look to recent American history. The CIA declassified files reveal horrifying atrocities that the American government has committed through the CIA. While these documents are publicly available now, what would you have been called if you suggested that WHILE it was happening? </p>
<p>We all it: "Conspiracy theorist." </p>
<p>The thing that sets the "conspiracy theorist" apart from the masses is not the absurdity of the idea but in how different the idea is to mainstream consciousness and thought patterns. </p>
<p>For example, in 1920 you would be considered a "conspiracy theorist" if you said man would walk on the Moon. Now you're considered a "conspiracy theorist" if you suggest otherwise. </p>
<p>Nuanced thought has been lost in modern times, or perhaps humanity never really had it. It's easy to glorify the past. </p>
<p>There are true conspiracy theories, and there are false ones. There are founded ones and unfounded ones. Not everything exists in a black or white plain like the media would have you believe. </p>
<p>We are already seeing the awakening of those around us. As each month goes by, more and more people will wake up to the destruction that lockdowns have caused, and people will check the numbers and realize that this was not as scary as the media portrayed it to be. </p>
<p>It will be in THOSE moments that people realize lockdowns weren't a thing, but rather than admitting their fault they will pretend as if they had always opposed lockdown, because in 1-2 decade's time that will be the mainstream virtuous thing to do.</p>
<p>Here's another way to imagine it: "draining one's blood" was a common medical treatment just hundreds of years ago, yet it did nothing but harm people. </p>
<p>Those that questioned this as the time were seen as insane and shunned. Few experts were willing to question "muh Science" because they used Science as a BELIEF and not as a TOOL to find TRUTH. </p>
<p>We are seeing the same today. </p>
<p>Lockdowns have undoubtedly caused far greater damage than the virus unleashed, and public consciousness WILL change to match truth, but it will take a LONG time. </p>
<p>As intoxicating it may feel to receive the validation and agreement of those around you, I encourage you, dear free thinker, to take note RIGHT NOW of where everyone stood RIGHT NOW, to protect yourself when the next "big end of the world crisis" comes. </p>
<p>For me personally I predicted that the media was over-blowing this in January 2020, by doing a data analysis. I received death threats for suggesting that Covid-19 was not end of the world. If you may recall, many politicians initially said Covid-19 fear was blown out of proportion.... Until they saw how they could use it to their advantage, and until the media continued to scare people so much that the masses wanted the politicians to "do something." </p>
<p>I will personally give some leniency to those scared in the first half of 2020 because the media campaigns were damn well effective, and their persuasion hard to counter at first (just 2 weeks to flatten the curve, right?). </p>
<p>But by the time we had BLM protests, anyone who continued to promote lockdowns, snitch on others, and continue believing in this cult will be marked down in the darkest pen ink that I can find and also saved to an online file, never to be forgotten by myself.</p>
<p>Oh how absurd is it to proclaim that we must limit Thanksgiving to but 10 family members when tens of thousands are allowed to storm the streets in "mostly peaceful protests!" </p>
<p>Do a quick Google search: "did black lives matter spread covid?"  </p>
<p>It does NOT take a medical "expert" to realize the insanity of arguing that massive ten-thousand person protests and riots did NOT spread Covid, while Thanksgiving was the event to kill Grandma. </p>
<p>We live in an unprecedented time where not just freedom but liberty and justice are at severe risk of being lost forever in the name Covid, or rather the Cult of Covid. </p>
<p>By March 2021, anyone who has not awoken to the utter insanity that is this nonsense is a severe danger to the free thinker. </p>
<p>It requires only 15 minutes of research at most to realize just how NON-deadly this virus is. It really is not a conspiracy. Which terrifies me even more - how could one support lockdowns by June of 2021? </p>
<p>There WILL be "another strain" or some other major threat, whatever it is the media and governments can get away with.</p>
<p>And those people that happily complied and snitched and cheered on the lockdowns will be the same one warped into the mainstream narrative once again.  </p>
<p>So, friends and strangers, please do NOT forget the names of people big and small that contributed to this insanity. Trust me, in the coming years, few will pretend to have supported these lockdowns so intensely. </p>
<p>When the next threat comes around, they will be the first ones to silence you, attack you, snitch on you, destroy you, send you to the camps, execute you, anything in the name of virtue signaling for the elites to give them what little validation they can. They follow the masses, and shut down free thought.</p></p>

        <p>To be honest, we must be prepared for that as well. I suppose I’m writing in a hopeful fantasy that everything will be okay. But I’m sure that’s what those that saw the truth living in 1930’s Germany Hoped for as well.</p>

        <p>The most we can hope for is a brief illusion of normality for a while, but we night not even get that before the combo of inflation, cyberattacks, online lockdowns, food shortages, further Covid "waves", and vax side-effects all start battering us.</p>

        <p>Very true. I am generally speaking getting better at riding the waves. I party a little extra hard during non locked down times and work a little extra hard during lockdown. Trying to sync my life to limit how much I notice it. But it’s damn hard.</p>

        <p>Pre-Covid-normal is inacceptible!</p>
<p>what this plandemic has uncovered is that we were living in a completely controlled and manipulated system based upon nothing but deception, lies and propaganda. </p>
<p>this system will not last as it is already in the process of falling apart!</p>
<p>dont stop this fight even when things go back to "normal" as this "normal" was actually never a fair system!</p>
<p>the matrix is collapsing now and we will carry it to its grave!</p>

<p><strong>"MASKS PROHIBITED ON PREMESIS"</strong> sounds about right for a start. Normally, someone comes into your business wearing a mask, it's because they're planning to rob the damn place.</p>
