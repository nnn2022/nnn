        <p>If you look at my profile, you'll see that I'm mostly on the Covid-19 lockdown subreddits. This is not an accident. I run into a lot of crazy people when I talk against the Covid cult, some of whom have gone so far as to attempt to doxx me and call for my imprisonment on trumped up "assault" charges, the alleged "assault" consisting of my purely verbal dissent with what they had to say. I don't want maniacs like them tracking me down, so my other interests (the ones I attach my name to) are kept separate from this one. So separate that they're not even on Reddit.</p>
<p>Some of the crazies I ran into recently got angry with me because I would not support their crankish theories, when they decided to leave Medicine (a subject in which I am not an authority) behind, and dabble in Physics (a subject in which I have actual degree). The theory I ran into last night was that by refusal to validate a clearly ludicrous theory about how air would flow, I was being aggressive and violent toward the crank advancing the theory.</p>
<p>What was new for me was what came next. Some butthurt individual not only decided to spout that crazy, entitled rhetoric, but he followed up by filing a report based on his fascinating theory that dissent was violence. I then was notified of his report, or at least got something that was supposedly such a notification.</p>
<p>You can see a screenshot of that alleged notification, above. After this, I'll cut and paste a copy of the message, so you can get a closer look. Those of you who have been on Facebook might find something that is very familiar about this, in a highly unsettling way.</p>

        <p>This is the message I got, sent ten hours ago (according to the system):</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> There are people and resources here for you:</p>
<p><strong>Text:</strong>  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Hi there,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A concerned redditor reached out to us about you.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;When you're in the middle of something painful, it may feel like you  don't have a lot of options. But whatever you're going through, you  deserve help and there are people who are here for you.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Text CHAT to</strong> <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/"><strong>Crisis Text Line</strong></a> <strong>at 741741.</strong> You'll be connected to a Crisis Counselor from Crisis Text Line, who is  there to listen and provide support, no matter what your situation is.  It's free, confidential, and available 24/7.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If you'd rather talk to someone over the phone or chat online, there are additional resources and people to talk to. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines">Find Someone Now</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If you think you may be depressed or struggling in another way, don't  ignore it or brush it aside. Take yourself and your feelings seriously,  and reach out to someone.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It may not feel like it, but you have options. There are people available to listen to you, and ways to move forward.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Your fellow redditors care about you and there are people who want to help.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If you think you may have gotten this message in error, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/report?reason=its-targeted-harassment-at-me">report this message</a>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;To stop receiving messages from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/RedditCareResources">u/RedditCareResources</a>, reply “STOP” to this message.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Charming, isn't it? Those who've been on Facebook for a while will recognize the message. It is the one that Facebook sent out to users before calling the cops on them. Reason had <a href="https://reason.com/2019/02/13/facebooks-calls-cops-on-sad-accounts/">an article about that</a>, and the whole thing turned in quite a scandal.</p>
<p>In this case, then, if this message is to be taken at face value, some user knowingly filed a false report of a suicide threat in order to punish me, not merely for dissent - which would be a rather KGB kind of thing to do, misusing the mental health system in order to silence dissent - but apparently for dissent in an area in which I could legitimately claim some level of expertise, and the person filing the report had none, given the timing. The layman tried to get the scientist put into a psychiatric ward, because the scientist would not agree with him.</p>
<p>The person this probably is, can be seen posting about his use of recreational drugs and how it has enhanced his experiences while masturbating. If I sounded like I was about to call this fellow a mini-<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Lysenko+site%3A.edu">Lysenko</a>, not at all. Lysenko was a towering genius compared to this fellow. The day we see society take the form people like him would like to see it have, we'll end up wishing we were living under Stalin.</p>
<p>Things will be that crazy, and that bad.</p>

        <p>Note that I said "alleged notification." Why would I say alleged.</p>
<p>I do that because I'm not absolutely sure that u/RedditCareResources,</p>
<p>which sent the message, really is under the control of a Reddit employee and not just a user who decided to set up an account with "Reddit" as part of his username, just to scam his way into a little extra perceived power. The fact that this alleged company account has only been up for a few months and has a karma of 42 looks fishy.</p>
<p>I sent in a report of the account, along with a brief description of the incidents mentioned above to support, asking them to look at u/RedditCareResources, and see if that's really a company page or if it's just something set up by somebody who wants to pass himself off as a company employee.</p>
<p>Either way, something really shady just happened. The only question is exactly what that is, but in either case, yes, I'm getting harassed.</p>

        <p>Just gave that reply, myself.</p>
<p>Thought I'd hold off until I got a screenshot of the message and a chance to cut and paste it, before replying to it and making it vanish. Now that I've got that done, I can get u/RedditCareResources out of my box. I hope.</p>
<p>It's a good feeling, at least for now.</p>
