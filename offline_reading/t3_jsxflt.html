        <p>This number is people dying WITH COVID, not due to COVID. They are not the same thing. Still, we should be protecting vulnerable people who are at risk of dying FROM COVID.</p>
<p>Imagine if the entire country were given a common cold test, then over the next 30 days anyone who died was considered a "common cold death". We'd have a pandemic! Same principle.</p>

        <p>I have heard reports of that, I guess it is a bit of a gray area. For example, say someone is hospitalized with Covid-19 and has some pre-existing condition that limits lung functions. If that person dies in the hospital due to respiratory distress, how do we know if it was due to the pre-existing condition, or covid? Or perhaps it was the pre-existing condition, but covid agitated that condition causing the death.  </p>
<p>I think the "common cold death" is a bit of a stretch, given that it rarely results in death, unlike covid. Going back to what I said earlier, there  wouldn't be any confusion as to which condition killed the patient. Clearly the common cold was not the cause of death.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the civil reply. Yes I think the "6% COVID only" claim is inaccurate too, since it can absolutely be a key contributor along with all the other existing conditions. My point bringing up the cold is to show how the numbers can be inadvertently manipulated just based on test results and whether or not people ultimately die.</p>

        <p>Yeah I see that as well. Even if the numbers are exaggerated, it seems unlikely that this is something to be ignored, as so many seemingly believe.   </p>
<p>I'll link to a thread where I provided some covid numbers in comparison to the flu. I think we're using the flu just as a reference, since many people are more familiar with it. Most people, myself included, have had it at some point. But given those numbers, I think it's pretty hard to argue that this pandemic is just an over hyped flu season.  </p>

        <p>Something to really consider is that influenza deaths are not counted the same way Covid deaths are.</p>
<p>If my 87 year old grandpa with diabetes, kidney failure, and a history of smoking (aka "an average old dude") was in a seniors home and was on his way to death .. and then he got the flu .. and then he died in his sleep 3 weeks later ... people wouldnt say "he was killed by the flu"</p>
<p>In that same scenario if it was Covid he <em>would</em> qualify as a Covid death.</p>
<p>Doctor can code a death Covid even without a positive test if they "assume Covid contributed to the death".  (How much that happens depends on the actual doctor involved).</p>
<p>But flu deaths are not tabulated the same way <em>at all</em>.  If they were we would have flu stats that were much higher.</p>

        <p>I mean, it’s a well known fact that in the medical scene as well as certain other humanitarian science studies, individuals / entities get incentives to do work to make discoveries. </p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.healthleadersmedia.com/finance/fact-check-hospitals-get-paid-more-if-patients-listed-covid-19-ventilators">here</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/3000638001">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4897385/user-clip-cdc-director-acknowledges-inflation-covid-19-death-count">here</a></p>

        <p>Another thing to consider, we (clinics) get requests for physicians to hand over all their documentation on patients who have tested positive or were treated for COVID turning the timeline said clinician saw them. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They send these to all providers who have seen the patient in last few months -  and the ones Ive seen these are docs who had NOTHING to do wth COVID. For example, the ankle surgeon who operated on said patient 4 months prior to the COVID incident. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One doc refuses to reply to these because he claims it reports it as a seperate case - meaning all these reports for one patient are recorded separately.  physicians reporting the same positive would be inflating their Numbers. I dont know how much truth there is to that, but hes not the type to makes a stink over things so I assume he has some reasoning. Rather than flick the pen he gave me a speech about it.</p>

        <p>Yes the hospital counts confuses me, and I dont really have much insight into that world.</p>
<p>I <em>assume</em> it is a combination of well-intentioned "better safe than sorry" behaviour that errs on the side of Covid, as well as $$ incentives and various bits of social pressure.</p>
<p>It still seems like it would be easy to spot it all in some kind of audit?</p>

        <p>May not want to be spotted. What good does it do the local government to not be on the list to receive aid?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also I considered maybe its supposed to be about tracking how many health professionals wouldve possibly been dealing with the person. id like to think if they want access to someones entire medical history for a period of time pre-COVID, maybe theyre doing research. Looking at what was going on with the patient and how it may as impacted their COVID experience. But they didnt disclose anything of that nature.</p>

        <p>You don’t get it at all obviously. Stop spewing your incorrect information. You could test positive, and then get hit by a bus tomorrow and that is a corona death. That is what we are talking about.</p>

        <p>300,000 people are born every day. All those Americans - many near death already - who've died with COVID this year? Replaced by new babies in a single day. The million or so worldwide who've died with COVID? Replaced in less than a week. That's life: the old and infirm die to make way for the birth of the new. We aren't running out of humans anytime soon, so where's the humanitarian disaster?</p>
