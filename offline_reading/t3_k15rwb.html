<p>Guy's saying the PCR test is meant to detect 3 SARS-COV2 specific genes, but Italy was issuing positive results if 1 of those genes was detected. </p>
<p>Guy says an active virus would throw a hit on all 3 of those genes.</p>
<p>&rt;Stefano Scoglio: swabs look for 3 genes characterizing SARS-CoV-2: E gene, RdRp gene &amp; N gene. "If the virus were present, all 3 would have to be found, because if the virus is intact, the only case in which it can have a pathogenic role &amp; infect, the test must find all 3 genes"</p>

        <p>He is absolutely correct there. If you are only finding 1 of those genes, it means you were infected in the past and RECOVERED. They are finding dead virus which means guess what?</p>

<p>&rt; "In short, in total we have a difference of only 6 nucleotides out of 214, a percentage of just 2.8%. And that is why even when independent authors tested the efficiency of the Drosten test they concluded that the test showed: <br>

&rt; "... a lot of cross-reactions with Coronavirus BtRs-BetaCoV (MK211374- MK211378), SARS coronavirus Urbani (MK062179-MK062184), Bat coronavirus (KY770858-KY770859), SARS coronavirus (AH013708-AH013709)". </p>

        <p>Yes, that's what it means.  These tests are less than useless for detecting the Wuhan Flu.</p>
<p>The very inventor of the technology they use said explicitly that it was never meant to test for infection. </p>
<p>All the hype about "record number of new infections" is based on lies.</p>

        <p>Unrolled thread of this tweet: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1331500903564775426.html</p>
<p>Part of the thread (it's very long): </p>
<p>ITALIAN NOBEL PRIZE CANDIDATE 2018 Dr Scoglio explains the Covid19 test fraud, there is more to this than false positives: </p>
<p><em>"swabs look for 3 genes characterizing SARS-CoV-2: E gene, RdRp gene &amp; N gene. "If the virus were present, all 3 would have to be found, because if the virus is intact, the only case in which it can have a pathogenic role &amp; infect, the test must find all 3 genes.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, this was initially the case and the results of the swabs were only positive if all three genes were found. But everything has changed since last April.</em></p>
<p><em>The note of this Italian RT-PCR test reads "from 02/04/2020, in agreement with the regional coordinating center, the detection of even a single SARS-CoV-2 target gene is interpreted as a POSITIVE test".</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Scoglio hypothesized that, if the initial criteria for communicating the results of the swabs had been maintained, we would almost certainly not have detected all the "asymptomatic positives". 
It can also be read in the Italian RT-PCR results: «Detected positive with CT values under 35. It should be remembered that this condition, in more than 95% of cases, is not associated with the presence of infectivity.</em></p>
<p><em>Fausto Baldanti, Head of the Molecular Virological Unit at the San Matteo Polyclinic in Pavia study results: "In 400 positives with CT 30 only 9 were able to transmit infections to cell cultures (2.3%)."</em></p>
<p><em>"Furthermore, not all genes identified by the swab have the same relevance. The researcher Scoglio pointed out that for example:</em>  </p>
<p><strong>"the SARS-Cov 2 E-gene is 100% identical to that of SARS-CoV-1"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instead, the N gene has only one variation from SARS-CoV-1. "The chances of confusion and cross-reactivity (detecting a SARS virus other than SARS-CoV-2) are very high."</strong></p>
<p><em>The most relevant in the swab results is the RdRP2 gene with 5 out of 64 variations from SARCoV1. The result changes a lot if this gene is found rather than the other two.</em></p>
<p><em>In this specific "POSITIVE", "The only gene detected, as if its non-specificity and cross-reactivity were not enough, was detected with a number of PCR cycles greater than 35, which, according to all serious PCR experts, generates unreliable results , and is generally "junk"</em></p>
<p><em>"The "Drosten PCR Test" &amp; the Institute Pasteur test, considered the most reliable (although neither have been externally validated), both use a test of the E gene, even if the Drosten test uses it as preliminary test, while the Institut Pasteur uses it as a definitive test."</em></p>
<p><em>"According to the authors of the Drosten test, the E-gene test is able to detect all Asian viruses, thus being both very non-specific (all viral strains) and limited to a geographical area (Asia)."</em></p>
<p><em>"And then in April, WHO has changed the protocol recommending that from now on a test can be considered positive even if only the dosage of gene E (WHICH WILL PROBABLY DETECT ALL ASIAN VIRUSES!) gives a positive result”.</em></p>
<p><em>At what cycle thresholds do you effectively create a "ghost virus" out of these gene PCR tests?</em></p>
