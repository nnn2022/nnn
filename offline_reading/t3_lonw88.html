    <strong>C.I.A. coins the term Conspiracy theorist a few months before the JFK assassination attempt.</strong>
    <p><p>They started introducing it to the masses and then after the assassination, went heavy with the conspiracy theorist propaganda. fast forward to today. Any rational and factual information, exposing the atrocities these evil people are doing today, is now just a conspiracy theory and 70 % of the NPC's belief it. CIA was successful in completely obliterating any real debate that would prove these "theories" true.</p></p>

        <p>actually the term was weaponized with the drafting in  1967 of CIA Document 1035-960 entitled "Countering Criticism...</p>
<p>try to back up your data with sources. i know they don't teach this as i'm in contact with a grad student who can barely rub two sticks together.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm aware the CIA weaponised the phrase in the wake of JFK‚Äôs assassination- think I‚Äôve even seen classified docs alluding to as much!</p>
<p>But the phrase ‚Äòconspiracy theory‚Äô to me has only come into public consciousness the past 2years &amp; definitely since Covid rocked up.
Of course I‚Äôm sure it got attention when Trump &amp; the Qanon stuff was being touted too.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd say It wasn‚Äôt even around in the wake of 9/11.
My own personal interactions with the phrase happened only last month when my sister who works in a care home got the Covid vaccine-
I made it known what I thought of the vaccines &amp; her response was lowering her head &amp; a sly sideways glance &amp; she said ‚Äúooh do you think it‚Äôs a conspiracy?‚Äù</p>
<p>So.. what I‚Äôm trying to explain is the CIA have been very successful in what they set out to do because my own sister who has her own little perfect world &amp; believes in lone gunmen, never heard of building 7 &amp; has never seen the press conference of Neil &amp; buzz looking depressed as fuck after walking on the moon- but has somehow grasped the dark deluded connotations that go with someone believing in a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>100% wrong there. I was called a conspiracy theorist after 9/11.</p>
<p>This subject is discussed in Adam Curtis' new doc. He said the first idea was to post stuff in the back of Playboy about gun owners having small dicks etc</p>

        <p>Sorry.. of course it was around.</p>
<p>What I meant to say was it wasn‚Äôt as wide spread.
Undoubtedly that has everything to do with social media.
Virtually every Covid related post on fbook now has someone calling out the bs followed by 100 replies of tin foil memes &amp; the like.</p>
<p>Could you imagine if we had the social media we have now around the time of 9/11?
That would have resulted in some really ugly scenes.
Never heard of Adam Curtis, will check him out.</p>
