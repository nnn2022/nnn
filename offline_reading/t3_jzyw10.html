    <strong>Athletes with covid issues</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys I was noticing a lot more issues with athletes suffering from heart issues related to or speculated to be related to covid. Do you think this is because teams/players are more on the lookout for these types of issues unlike something like mono, the flu or pneumonia or can we say this is a serious concern for potential younger people who come down with covid? Maybe this is just rare but I came across some data and was wondering everyone’s thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Michael Ojo was 27 and died of a heart attack. He just recently recovered from covid. A lot of people are saying post-covid myocardial infarction had to do with his sudden death but not confirmed. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-ojo-former-florida-state-center-dies-age-27/</p>
<p>These are myocarditis incidences where players are either out for the season or have had scans that show up with issues. </p>

<p>Armstead in and out of hospital with issues</p>
<p>https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30187081/sources-jacksonville-jaguars-rb-ryquell-armstead-battling-covid-19-expected-miss-rest-season</p>
<p>I guess my question is, is this something that should be considered rather than just IFR when factoring in lockdowns? Or are these just rare occurrences? I don’t remember this ever happening with players that had other viral illnesses, etc but maybe it’s just being covered more.</p></p>

        <p>Well maybe it's just now that people started to notice and study that there are post infection effects on your health, in some cases.</p>
<p>But still doesn't justify any of the nonsense that's going on now with restrictions, mandates and "essential" people.</p>

        <p>Steroids cause heart issues.  Any chance these people have steroid use in their history?  Undiagnosed heart issues have caused seemingly healthy people to drop dead also, happened to a 22 yr old in Boulder after running a 10k last year.  A few anecdotal stories don't mean much.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure steroids were a factor but Ojo was over 7 foot and 300 pounds so maybe that factored in.</p>

        <p>Yeah the NBA has done mandatory cardiac screens for every player for at least a decade+. Four NBA players got heart surgery in 2004-2005. </p>

        <p>They are pushing people to wear masks which detriments respiratory function, that could be one factor</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p><em>...study on 44 healthy subjects... Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask</em>  </p>
<p>Effect is like smoking, so if you stress your body as athletes do, while damaging your respiratory function it is possible to negatively affect your heart.</p>
<p>And my personal experience also matches this effect. Wearing a surgical mask limits respiratory function.</p>
<p><strong>Inconsistent breathing, even slight, profoundly affects  heart rate variability  (HRV)</strong></p>
<p>And breathing constantly through masks certainly affect HRV. Read more here:</p>
