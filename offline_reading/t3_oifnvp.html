    <strong>Sustainable economy</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t even know where I can post this. But y’all seem to be the only like minded people (right minded) who would understand. </p>
<p>First, I’m a millennial. Almost 30. So I wasn’t working when in 2008 when the housing market crashed so I don’t even know what to expect. </p>
<p>But this economy is…bullshit. Inflation is real. And it’s already killing me. I’m single and it’s just my dog and me..and I’m struggling. Huge shout out to all you single moms and dads out there. I pray for y’all. </p>
<p>But anyway…I signed a 12 month lease for an apartment last July. Rent then was $1230. NOW?! THE NEW RENT IS $1865! It’s 759 square feet. One bedroom. And from what I’ve been seeing, this is pretty much all over. </p>
<p>Something is going to happen. This is unsustainable.</p>
<p>But my question is, WHAT is going to happen?!</p>
<p>And at what point will businesses recognize the inflation is happening and adjust our salaries to..oh I don’t know…avoid living in poverty?!</p></p>

        <p>sorry bro.  i work in finance and i can tell you  doom is nigh for this capitalistic fraud market.  Its not capitalism, its downright hemorrhagic fraud to a level that is ridiculously unsustainable.  get what you can out of it before the floor falls out because we have been floating on borrowed time for over a decade at least</p>

        <p>I really don't know what's going on with the economy but I know it's bad a something big is coming. I've never seen prices rise like this. lumber is like 300% increase or more since the pandemic. Housing and rent prices are at all time highs. I noticed and increase in grocery goods as well. Gas prices as well. My dollar is stretched so thin these days. I think a huge crash will come shortly, as you mentioned this is not substantial. No one can live with these insane prices. 1,000 sq. Ft homes are selling for 500k in my neighborhood. I know the average family income can't afford those prices.</p>

        <p>Cash is freedom.  So the authoritarians want to take away cash and all the privacy it provides.</p>
<p>The first step is a currency crisis.  They are printing money like there is no tomorrow - precisely because there is no tomorrow for the greenback.</p>
<p>Once the crisis starts, the solution will be digital dollar tokens managed by the Federal Reserve.  Every seller, buyer, and item being paid for will need central approval.  Every transaction will be on the books and taxed.  They may decide to out time limits on your tokens so you don't save them.</p>
<p>You'll own nothing but be happy.</p>

<p>Its gonna crash hard,  and all we can do is hold on tight. </p>
<p>Staying afloat is all we can do for now,  the stimulus checks are designed to ensure we're all forever in debt to the government so we rely on them for food, shelter and health. They're creating a subservient class and it's working really well.  We can either accept a life of debt and subscription based ownership of your belongings or buy and own a many assets you can while you still can, other wise you're jusr a cog in this socialist / communist new normal</p>

<p>The great reset, explained by a comedian so its not such a hard pill to swallow, but yeah they've literally told us this was all going to happen and that we should embrace it for the sake of humanity, which is easy to say when you're a board member of the World economic forum.
We can't fight it,  but we can prepare for it.  ❤</p>

I'd stock up on guns and ammo, much more utilitarian. You can defend yourself and hunt with it, and is probably a good form of currency when there isn't a de facto currency in place</p>

        <p>Horrible example, but one that really makes people go "... Wait, what???".. a double cheeseburger is up almost 300% over the last 12 years.... think about this. It was a dollar as recently as 2009, it is now approaching $4.</p>
<p>Was $1.69 in 2019.. so most of this increase is over the last 2 years.</p>
<p>Another thing that tends to shock people into realizing something is very wrong, mention that more than half of all money in circulation was printed in the last year.. that tends to pierce the protective bubble they built around themselves and at least get people to react with more than indifference.</p>

        <p>The economy is going to have a huge crash far worse than 2008 within the next year or two. The government has shut businesses down and forced people out of work for the past year and a bit while also pumping the economy with stimulus (hint, stimulus doesn’t sustain REAL economic growth), racking up the debt to horrific numbers. We have labor shortages right now because people do not want to work. Despite what former President Trump, and current President Biden say about how well the economy is doing... they are lying. Government created jobs are not real jobs and inflation, is not economic growth. </p>
<p>Anyways to try and help your situation a little bit: start cutting shit out you do not need, save every extra penny. Stop the bad (financial) habits (if you have any); fast food, drugs/alcohol. If you haven’t already, start looking into investing, learn the markets and how they work (although I may stray from investing in the short term, as I believe there will be a crash soon), so that when the markets crash you can make some money off that.</p>

        <p>Yup, you’re right. People think the government is some magical entity that can spawn resources and wealth out of nowhere... I don’t understand how people genuinely believe printing money makes us richer.</p>

        <p>If you want to learn about the economy as a whole, and the government role/function, really any episode of Peter Schiff on Joe Rogan will do it( #1145 or #1002 are my favourites). He is what got me into economics, mainly because (and Peter admits this) he really isn’t a genius, and neither am I. But the economy (from a free market view) is so simple to understand which is what Peter explains. He outlines all the ways the government messes everything up by destroying efficiency, affordability, and quality of the private sector. I would get a decent understanding of how the economy works before jumping into understanding investing since it builds off a lot of how the economy works... Schiff also does a good financial podcast on his own... Few other good people to read/lookup on; Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell. Hope this helps!</p>

        <p>You ain't seen nothing yet.</p>
<p>The value of money, under the Fiat Currency FRB system is GDP of the Country, divided by the number of Dollars in Circulation.</p>
<p>During this made up crisis, businesses have been shuttered, and the economy has ground to a near halt. Unnecessary purchases put off, necessary purchases restricted, services unavailable... so the GDP of those countries has fallen dramatically. GDP, Gross Domestic Product,  is "The value of all goods and services produced in a country". </p>
<p>At the same time, they have printed WAY more dollars, just making them up out of thin air.</p>
<p>It's the fabled "Double Whammy". Less value divided by MORE dollars means that each dollar in your pocket is worth about 25 Cents.</p>
<p>It takes 18 months to 2 years to fully catch up.
The inflation you have seen in the last year is the tip of the Iceberg. Prices have about doubled on many things. 
They will Double yet again by the summer of 2022, being around 400% of what they were in 2019. </p>
<p>And, it's only gonna get worse.
That 400% figure is if they fully reopen the economy NOW.
If they continue the lockdowns and continue printing money, it only gets worse.</p>
<p>Then, interest rates rise. In the early 1980s, mortgage interest rates rose from around 4-6% to over 20% in around 18 months.
People who's 5% mortgages were coming due had to refinance those mortgages at 18 and 20%, mortgage payments going from $300 a month to $1800 a month.</p>
<p>The figures is just used are examples, not accurate amounts before the Trolls start pulling out calculators. 
I was in my teens, and it was 40 years ago.
It's the point that's important. Housing prices SOARED and many people lost homes and life savings.</p>

        <p>I'm the same age. I've been blessed to work a job that pays well, and I'm single. I too am concerned with what the real play is.</p>
<p>I hear about precious metals. I look into companies to buy them from and I see some less than stellar reviews. Then it's the issue if storing the stuff, or being able to use it in the quantities I may need some day.</p>
<p>I know about crypto enough to understand many people say it's going to be life changing or it's just a scheme.</p>
<p>We all know the dollar is not getting stronger thanks to all of this, either.</p>
<p>I have a Roth IRA through work and I dabble in TD Ameritrade myself. I haven't bought new stock in months simply because I am not sold on anything.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm sure of, or mostly sure of, is that assets are always a plus. Problem with some valuables is that they are only valuable if society holds together. That's where I find things like food, firearm related stuff, and other necessities can be a good idea to stock up on. I don't mean that in a classic prepper sense, but having stuff that you know people will want is the simplest way to move forward if you are stuck on the sidelines due to finances or your own trepidation.</p>

        <p>All of this. </p>
<p>Ya know, since I’m on Reddit and we’re all honest here…(lol) I did it wrong from the beginning. I listened to the generations before us and got not only a bachelors but a freaking masters. In education. </p>
<p>Taught for a few years only to make literally NOTHING. $100k (YES ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS) in student loans that honestly I’ll never be able to pay back. Didn’t worry about it then because of that “promise” to forgive loans for teachers. (And if anyone who reads this wants to make any sort of comment that might raise my heart rate and blood pressure even the slightest, please refrain. I know. I am 100% well aware that I am indebted to the government for the rest of my life. Sure college taught me a lot. Amazing experience as far as learning how to be a functioning human being. But do I feel $100k-smart? Absolutely freaking not. And I even went to one of the top universities in the nation. Masters program was #1 in the country. I would totally trade back my piece of paper/diploma for my freedom. But here we are) </p>
<p>I’m out of education now. Partly because the pay is literally poverty. And because the lack of respect is demoralizing. But I’ll never get my shit together. </p>
<p>And really I’m mad about it. Because I work hard. And I’m not a bad person…or at least I try not to be. I 100% realize it was my name signed on the dotted lines for those student loans. And even though I didn’t realize then I was signing my entire life and future to the US government, it is completely my responsibility that I will forever owe that money. I, along with all the other Americans who are forever drowning at the hands of Fed Loans, are responsible. And I don’t think student loans should be forgiven. </p>
<p>But then you mix the inflation in. Add in the increasing cost of living. And quite frankly it makes me give up on any hope that I’ll ever just be living “comfortably.” </p>
<p>It’s just really a huge…bummer. It’s a freaking bummer. </p>
<p>I need a miracle lol if you read this, god bless you. Seriously. I needed to vent. Thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>Hey man. I've always been the type to chew a person only if they don't understand. It someone cuts me off on the street but realizes their mistake I'm not going to go nuts on the horn or follow them on their bumper. They know they made a mistake, period.</p>
<p>So you are in that spot. Anyone digging a hole deeper than you already have is just unnecessary and cruel.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are a hard worker and thinker have you not felt interested in a transportation job? Even truck driving you could make better money and listen to podcasts and music while you work. You'd get to see the country and meet a ton of people.</p>
<p>Just trying to spark ideas that might bring you closer to where you want to be without more money problems.</p>

        <p>Well….I’m actually a woman lol and props to all the lady truck drivers out there but I’ll openly admit I 100% fit the stereotype of, “women are bad drivers.” You don’t want me behind the wheel of anything bigger than my Honda. Lol </p>
<p>Right now I have a job I really like and there’s a lot of potential for growth. I just need to keep working hard and gradually start making more. I guess I kind of screwed myself over spending half of my 20s getting a pointless masters degree and the other half trying to figure out who I even was as a person/learning to love myself/ figuring out what it that I love. Not what someone else wants me to love. Hope that makes sense. </p>
<p>I’ve been starting some freelance writing on the side. Just have to keep believing in myself and working hard. (And occasionally coming to Reddit when I just wanna get it all of my chest lol)</p>

        <p>Haha my mistake! And it's good to know you are aware of what you are good at and what you arent. That helps when it comes to any form of success.</p>
<p>Are you in a position to meet people who have more than you? My mom works at coffee shops and meets a lot of, I suppose you could say well off, people who she has been able to network with. She was invited to a July 4th party at a farm where there was lawyers and other successful people that may end up coming in handy some day.</p>
<p>If you were a teacher I imagine you are atleast somewhat likeable and sociable!</p>

        <p>I would like to think I’m likeable…definitely can confirm that I am sociable lol</p>
<p>That’s actually really great advice. So, since I’m already telling you my life story…when I started my new job (March 2020), it was in Atlanta. That’s where I’m from. Well, as my incredible luck would have it, as soon as Covid got bad (June/July 2020), they cut my position. (At this point I’m like omg I’m about to start my fifth career and I’m not even 30 lol)….but they offered me a different position in SC. </p>
<p>If you can’t read between the lines very well, I’ll just go ahead and tell you: this was most definitely the peak of my quarter life crisis. </p>
<p>I never would have expected that I would actually move somewhere where I didn’t know anyone. But I figured I had nothing else to lose lol besides my family, there wasn’t anything in Georgia really holding my down. So I moved last July. </p>
<p>Note to self- moving during a pandemic is not the most optimal time to relocate if you’re looking to meet new people. </p>
<p>But in the last couple of months things have started to open back up. I’m in a handful of networking groups…that won’t start meeting until August. (Unless that “second wave” puts us on “lockdown” again) but THIS IS GREAT ADVICE. I JUST NEED TO MARKET MYSELF! </p>
<p>AGAIN- sorry that I made you my therapist unwillingly. I guess when deciding on things to cut back on, my therapist should not have been one of them lol jk</p>

        <p>No it's fine! I have been through the Southern states a lot these last few years (I'm only a few hours from Canada) and enjoy it most everywhere, from Mississippi to SE Georgia. That's kind of cool that you just up and moved like that though, clearly you are willing to extend yourself and try new things. That will always be a great asset to have, although I'm sure you arent exactly thrilled at the idea of moving around like a gypsy lol.</p>

        <p>Several years ago I had to move unexpectedly AGAIN, so I went searching for something I could afford to buy so I wouldn't have to ever move again. It's a shit house in an okay neighborhood and is out in the country. It has issues that really aggravate me and I was looking forward to moving to a nicer place, but I am extremely glad I bought this instead of continuing to rent. My mortgage is cheaper than any rent I have ever paid. </p>
<p>You may want to look into that for the time being. And these shit, but affordable houses are still out there. I look all the time since I decided to move out of this covid clown state. Just don't buy something that needs a lot of woodwork because lumber prices are astronomical.</p>

        <p>Honestly a crash isn’t all that bad if you’re priced out of everything. I make over $100 per shift in tips and still can’t afford a little apartment or something for me and my boy so I’m waiting for a crash to essentially normalize everything. Bring it on dude</p>

        <p>I saw an article shared via tweet (actually I saw a screenshot of the tweet here on reddit as it's the only social media I can stomach thanks largely to NNN). It said that the silver lining to inflation is that wages go up. So it's not all bad. 
Just ignore that wages don't keep up with inflation. Then it doesn't seem so bad.</p>

        <p>Maybe I’m completely reading what you said wrong but….how can I “ignore that wages don’t keep up with inflation?” That’s the entire problem I’m dealing with. And so are millions of other Americans.</p>

        <p>i saw that post and the point of it is that there's actually no silver lining at all. corporations don't pay people more when the currency is devalued. the twitter user is a moron who doesn't understand economics.</p>
