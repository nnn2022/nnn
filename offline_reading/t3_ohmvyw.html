    <strong>For people saying anti vaxxers = anti science</strong>
    <p><p>Do you guys even know what science literally means?</p>
<p>Oxford dictionary defines science as:</p>
<p>science /ˈsʌɪəns  /
▸ noun [mass noun] the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment:</p>
<p>The main words used in this definition are 'observation' and 'experiment'. So, if I can see thousands of healthy people dying after taking their vaccine, this is an observation and also an experiment for the scientists. </p>
<p>THIS IS SCIENCE, not some doctor who studied 78 books on medicine and telling that vaccine is harmless.</p></p>

        <p>The problem is science has become a Dogma at this point, it's become religion to some people. They also don't seem to realize that for it to actually be science you are allowed to question it. If you're not allowed to question it and there's a stigma around questioning it and wanting to learn more that's when people who are hypnotized by this Dogma resort to calling you a murderer or a bad person and anti-science. Then there's the issue of only listening to some people and not others. It's just such a big mess</p>

        <p>Right, I myself am a pharmacy student and when I'll express my thoughts towards these Covid-19 vaccines to my peers, they will think that I'm a bigot.</p>
<p>They just can't understand that this vaccine was still in early development phase and the trials (which finished just in some months) of it aren't reliable. </p>
<p>My books teach me that it takes at least 7-8 years if not 20 years to really know if any new drug has any potential side effects or ADR (Adverse Drug Reaction).</p>
<p>Besides that, pharmaceutical industry isn't truly independent in today's world they have billions of dollars deals with other industries like porn industry and what not. Both rely on each other and their motive is how to make more money.</p>

        <p>It's the same thing some of us hear in Church, which is being said of Science.</p>
<p>I'll bet some of churchgoers here, past or present, will agree lol</p>
<p><em>"Do not rely on your own understanding of the Bible"</em></p>
<p><em>"Seek your elders for understanding"</em></p>
<p><em>"How dare you question. That's the Devil speaking through you now"</em></p>
<p><em>"I dunno? Is it Biblical?"</em> ( a version of "is your opinion backed by the current science?")</p>

        <p>In all fairness, the Lord has no problems with us asking Him questions. It's just that some people want to gatekeep because they themselves cannot answer.</p>

        <p>I agree.</p>
<p>I was made this way for a reason.</p>
<p>When I was a teen and in a youth group especially I had much insight as well, but all I saw was fear when I asked questions.</p>
<p>I suspected that they wanted to double-down or get authoritative (or some even going as far as to rebuke me), because perhaps it were thoughts they had, and they feared doubting their own faith - as if by doing so would damn them to Hell.</p>
<p>Of course, my intent was not to undermine or cast doubt, but to have a discussion.</p>
<p>For those unafraid, as were those in the Synagogue that "Jesus would spend days conversing and discussing the scriptures" no fear should be had if it is based in Truth.</p>
<p>Also it's okay to say "I don't know" lol</p>
