    <strong>How do you guys deal with gaslighting and manipulation from friends and family about what’s going on</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m at a point where I’ve exhausted myself in trying to get my friends and family to see the light. They are all in fear for their life and even those that don’t express that they hide behind “I’m protecting my grandma”. </p>
<p>99% recovery rate and 0.01% infection rate on top of a vaccine with apparently a up to 95% effective rate. Not sure if they’re choosing to ignore the math or they’re just that incompetent but that works out to smthn like a 0.0005% chance of catching or falling ill with covid post vaccination. Despite that they still willfully obey the mandates and criticize anyone that tries to question the logic of all that. </p>
<p>I don’t even argue with them anymore as some redditors have pointed out that they’ve already made up there mind. And that I shouldn’t obsess over sharing facts and statistics with them that go against their worldly views.</p>
<p>But how do you guys deal with being gaslit into taking the vaccine and what not. Even my family who used to ignore what I do and were okay with me not taking a vaccine despite all of them already taking it have recently started calling me selfish since I go out and live my life and that I’m gonna be “eventually bringing them the virus”. Its just a different feeling when your own friends and family treat you like a walking bio weapon despite contrary to the evidence.</p>
<p>Also what do you guys say to people that say they know people that died from the virus and say to me “ you’re not taking it as seriously as You should” they also state that they don’t think the virus will kill them but that their actions are based on a  need to “protect the vulnerable” </p>
<p>A specific example is that I know a friend that used to be very non Chalant about covid in the start and would say things like “covid isn’t that bad we all need to get infected so that we can all be immune to it and get over this virus” and he would call it a “overrated flu” this guy barely wears masks and ignores region lockdown restrictions but I was talking in a group chat the other day and he said something along the lines of, “I know people that died of covid now it’s a whole different ball game compared to when I made those statements to you”</p>
<p>in these circumstances I don’t want to seem insensitive cuz you will be gaslit and made to seem like you’re insensitive about people who died of this virus that I’m apparently “not taking seriously”</p></p>

        <p>We've been gaslit to hell for the entire year.</p>
<p>I get into these group chats, and I wreck absolute havoc.  It usually takes like 5-6 of them to take me down.  </p>
<p>They like to tag team in and out: "This has already been explained to you by Andrew." or whatever.  <em>Yes, and I've made a rebuttal to that point which nobody answered, but okay.</em></p>
<p>They demand for a "source".  Then you give them a source and they laugh and say, "not this source!".  </p>
<p>(You mean, the CDC shouldn't be cited as a source?).</p>
<p>"Show me a source!!"</p>
<p>So you send them something on YouTube.</p>
<p>"Haha!  I don't get my health information from YouTube!  You're so stupid!"</p>
<p>Followed two days later of the very same person posting a TikTok video telling everyone they are stupid for not getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>They pretend they don't understand your point.  "I can't believe you would compare covid to AIDS.  No virologist would do that." (I wasn't comparing the viruses.  I was comparing the social stigma surrounding the two).</p>
<p>Followed later by: "Yeah, I knew what you meant." (... But pretended I didn't only to gaslight you).</p>
<p>Followed by the concern trolling: "I'm really worried about you...  Are you okay?  Do you need some help?"</p>
<p>It's exhausting.  I know.  </p>
<p>These days I mock these people.  I use sarcasm and obvious hyperbole to prove the point.  I say their points back to them, but in an incredibly stupid way.  </p>
<p>Like, "Yes!  We should all lock down forever!  Think of how many lives we could save!!"</p>
<p>Or, "I totally agree!  In fact, I think we should throw all anti-vaxxers in jail and beat them everyday mercilessly yay!"</p>
<p>It usually takes 5-6 of them to take me down.  And I make sure they look ridiculous while they do it.</p>

        <p>You’re absolutely correct but I think at this point the people that have already taken the vaccine or bought into this whole scamdemic  have convinced themselves they are on the right side of history. If they are gonna blindly line up for experimental shots then i don’t think they are even capable of holding rational discussions which has been proven to me by them.</p>
<p>You introduce facts and logic and they counter with fear and emotion. Some of them have even flat out told me that “they already took the vaccine there’s nothing We can do about it now even if it was a fraud” and that I should just give it a rest. Unbelievable</p>

        <p>You will not convert someone with logic who arrived at their beliefs via another method.  Fear is the most powerful motivator.  They will never be convinced unless you alleviate their fear and/or scare them worse with the vaccine side effects</p>

        <p>Take some encouragement from the Black Sheep of my family. My wife and I have always been considered the "conspiracy nuts" in our family. Turns out we were right, sadly and all the conspiracies have dried up because they all came true. I never cared what they thought because I understood I was thinking 10 levels beyond anything they were thinking. I grasped long ago that my family is full of intelligent people that don't have a clue about the agendas set against them. And they don't want to know.</p>
<p>"Wide is the way, but narrow is the gate". You're never, ever going to convince them. The Bible says that "the wise man seeth evil and flees from it". Yet, what do you see and what do I see? <strong>People running TOWARDS it.</strong> How many of these people you are concerned with, family and friends, are wise in your estimation? This is a profound question and one of the instant ways I judge people I don't know. </p>
<p>I will not abide a fool and neither should you. They will get you killed.</p>

        <p>Redpill for the intelligent family members:
find a way to get the point across to them that the effects of gaslighting, propaganda, and manipulation all exploit vulnerabilities we humans share regardless of our intelligence. Ensure them that you won’t for a second question their very smart brain. Then remind them that they are just as human as all the participants in The Stanford Prison Expirement, Milgrams Experiments, and North Korea. Remind them that the results of the studies explain humans - not “low IQ humans.” Then ask them to consider why it is that every time they hear about one of these studies and imagine it, they mentally place themselves on the ends of the bell curves; you can’t realistically expect to be the only human on earth that is ALWAYS on the tails of EVERY bell curve right?</p>

        <p>I lucked out and most family members, friends, and acquaintances feel the same way I do. Some got the jab, but they aren't pushy about it. Some were crazy pushy at first, but even they have been shaken by the reports of side effects, the lies coming to light about how deadly and contagious the virus supposedly is, and the politicians getting caught saying one thing and doing another.</p>

        <p>My immediate family (wife/kids) are on the same page as me. Along with my in-laws. My siblings are mostly indifferent. My mother and step-father are another matter, as they've essentially bought into it wholesale. I don't even try to talk to them about it anymore. One big argument over the holidays was enough. Honestly, I like my in-laws a lot more than my own parents, anyway.  </p>
<p>As for my friends, well, some of them are on board with me, some are middle-of-the-road, and some went full-covitard. Haven't really even spoken to any of the latter group "friends" in months at this point, though. But some of those dropped off even before the coof due to other political differences. Orange man bad, basically. Oh well.</p>

        <p>It’s really really hard... I hope one day it gets better. I’m taking this as a lesson to better understand other people and be considerate of other view points. I have to take breaks though, I’m on a three week freedom trip in Florida. Homesick as all hell and it sucks seeing couples but the freedom is nice</p>

        <p>It sounds like you're giving people too much information.  When people ask if you're vaccinated, either tell them it's none of their business or tell them no.  If they ask why, tell them that your reasons are personal.  When you give them your reasons, you're just giving them ammunition to fight you with.</p>

        <p>Okay that might’ve sounded very domineering. But I was just summarizing my attempts to have a reasonable discussion but I’m already past the point where I try to have a genuine and factual conversation since they’ve flat out told me “what’s done can’t be changed” so you can’t hold logical conversations with these people.</p>
<p>Also I’m not sure if you’ve ignored the rest of what I said but the point of this post was what to do when I’m being gaslighted and manipulated into “seeing their light” for a lack of a better term</p>

        <p>I just don't talk about it. Switch it to "I'm so sorry you lost people. That must be really hard" and see if maybe they want to shift the convo to them. If they push the vaccine thing, and you don't want to just lie, it's softer to say "your doctor" told you not to get it because you've had bad allergic reactions in the past- or something like that. Best if expressed with "I wish I could and I surely would if my doctor says OK"! Once they don't feel there is anyone to convert, most people move on. It saves the peace and usually the relationship. At this point, everyone's got their opinions and people are only going to be more entrenched from here.</p>
