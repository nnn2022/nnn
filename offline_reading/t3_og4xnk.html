    <strong>What's App-conversation with a vaccinated person</strong>
    <p><p>The following conversation happened between a distant acquaintance and me.</p>
<p>It was in german and partly in voice-messages, so I'll summarize it and try to stay true to the contents.</p>
<p>Saturday:Her status reads: "Okay... Vaccination was yesterday... Today is muscle ache of death... Somehow I'll manage this week #goingtodienow #painsuppressantsrule"I took a screenshot of that status.</p>
<p>Today:Her status reads: "Headache of death... Can I please have my bottle of paracetamol back? The hour without was really nice... #wannagotothehospital #headache"I took a screenshot of that status and text to her:"Get well soon! I saved your last two statuses just in case someone asks me why I don't want it."</p>
<p>She answered with a voice-message, that from my memory contained: "Yes these probably are vaccination side-effects but I can't say for sure. I get headaches all the time. Other vaccines also cause side effects. You are the second one reacting like that. René (no idea who that is) said his parents both got chest-pain but that was four weeks after they got the vaccine. He says it's also side-effects but it could be anything. I know a lot of people who didn't have any side-effects!"</p>
<p>I answer: "Yeah, sure, I know this probably won't happen to everyone and doesn't necessarily have to do with it. It's just that I'd rather not take the risk."</p>
<p>She answered, again with a voice-message: "Really?! When you are not willing to take any risks with that, then you must not be taking anything that has potential side-effects! No medicine, no aspirin, nothing! I'd rather take a risk like that and maybe have these side-effects now for a few days than coming down with covid and being knocked out for 6 or 8 weeks."</p>
<p>Apparently she blocked me after that. I can't see her profile-picture anymore and my reply has only one check.</p>
<p>My reply, which she apparently didn't see anymore: "The way you say that sounds as if you'd think it's unusual if I tell you: "Yeah, sure, I actually don't do that anyways."</p>
<p>I don't drink alcohol, consume no other drugs (including caffeine) and also don't take medication.Last time I was at a doctor (2017) and got prescription-medication, I haven't even touched it. I was sure my immune-system would handle it just fine. And that's how it was: Three days in bed and all was well again."</p>
<p>I kinda expected that she probably regretted her decision due to the side-effects. But no. Somehow she seems to believe that she, as a 27 year-old, would suffer a much worse fate from covid than she currently is. I still don't know anyone in person who actually had covid but now I know someone (her) in person who had severe vaccination side-effects. With one out of four people who have let me know they are vaccinated that's 0% covid-risk vs. 25% vaccine-side-effect-risk. (René's parents, who she mentioned don't even count as I don't know them)</p>
<p>I don't think that having to throw in pain-meds and aspirin like tic-tacs is normal.</p>
<p>Also that she emphasized like I'm the one not willing to take risks, when apparently the risk for her to get covid scared her into getting vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, it surely is depressing how many people are mindlessly following the narrative.</p>
<p>Eventho it cost me some friends, I was on the big Demo in Berlin late August last year. Highly recommend visiting a bigger one if you feel alone.</p>
<p>Also if you live in southern germany feel free to hit me up, Im eager to find some new friends.</p>

        <p>Yes, I think they are. But I got lucky and slept at a friends friend place, which was awesome. This guy was a reptile freak and basically his whole flat was a huge terrarium. It was like another dimension, did not expect to sleep in a jungle next to three huge komodo dragons in the middle of Berlin.</p>
<p>Maybe you find one closer to your area. Its just great to see thousands of fearfree people.</p>

        <p>The big city near me isn’t safe enough fr a woman alone. I’d go to one in Cologne or Frankfurt with a friend tho. And as long as hotels are open I can travel 3-4hrs away. I like to have my own space.</p>

        <p>From how the people behaved in the city of Erfurt two weeks ago most seem to consider covid as pretty-much done.</p>
<p>Maybe 5% using masks outside of stores and people were partying on the streets until well after midnight. Noone cared about distancing or masking up.</p>
<p>It was a really nice atmosphere. Completely different to what the media still tries to portrait the situation.</p>
<p>As I said in my post I actually only know 4 people by name who are vaccinated. I guess it's a lot more who just never bothered to tell me or put something about it in their status.</p>
<p>So reading here is a lot scarier than looking around in real-life. It almost feels as if all hope is not lost. At least in the current situation it seems like it.</p>
<p>But then again I and two friends wanted to go to this:</p>
<p><a href="https://gemeinsam-gegen-die-tierindustrie.org/aufruf2021/">https://gemeinsam-gegen-die-tierindustrie.org/aufruf2021/</a></p>
<p>Until I read that:</p>
<p><a href="https://gemeinsam-gegen-die-tierindustrie.org/camp-2021-corona-2/">https://gemeinsam-gegen-die-tierindustrie.org/camp-2021-corona-2/</a></p>
<p>No thank you. Especially that last sentence. -_-</p>

        <p>No masks outside here either. Maybe everyone is vaxxed here because they are mostly over 60 since I’m in a rural area.</p>
<p>Ugh, they fully bought into it. RKI, multiple tests &amp; tracing, no way. Those nasal swabs are toxic too.</p>

        <p>I've never done a test so far. I think that believing that you can be infected while not having symptoms is just nonsense that defies the definition of being infected.</p>

        <p>As a fellow German I feel you. It gets harder and harder to dodge the vaccine. Had a friend from uni who is perfectly healthy, does exercise daily, took the vaccine because her part-time job demanded it. From one day to another she got high temperature and had to get hospitalized for 2 weeks. Now she got released but she has issues with being out of breath. She can literally walk 5 stairs a day and that's it. Still doesn't reget getting the vaccine.</p>

<p>I think what happens to them is:</p>
<p>Because they just know how bad Corona is.</p>
<p>And because they just know that the vaccine isnt as bad.</p>
<p>The worse their vaccine-reaction is, the worse Corona mustve been.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Basically: I did lose a leg to the vaccine, so I wouldve lost both legs and arms if I had caught Covid.</p>
