<title>Prior to 2020, if you walked into a store with a mask they'd probably assume you were going to rob the place. There were anti-masking laws, and people would get arrested at protests for masking up.</title>

    <p><p>Its weird how they told us the truth at first about mask effectiveness. </p>
<p>Then all of a sudden mask mandates were started, followed by mass rioting and looting. </p>
<p>Masks increase violence, because it gives people a degree of anonymity. Yes, there is facial recognition software, but if you have bad footage thats moot. </p>
<p>On another note, the city of philadelphia had banned bullet proof glass in stores in early 2020 because it was deemed "racist", then a month later they were told to put up some kind of glass to protect against C19.</p></p>

        <p>Excuse me? The second sentence is not accurate. There was not 'mass rioting and looting'. In fact the rioting and looting was done by white nationalist plants in the protests and in the grand scheme of things was small dimes on an economic scale.</p>
<p>Using the riots in California in the 1990's as a comparison and adjusting for inflation? The riots we saw in 2020 were less than 5% economically of riots in the 90's.</p>
