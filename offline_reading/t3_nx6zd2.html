&rt;If And if they haven't done so by now despite being prioritized, they can be said to be reluctant.  Think of the unvaccinated amongst them as being at high risk if infected (IFR&rt;10% is not absurd amongst 80+).And why herd immunity is even in the conversation at this stage is absurd.  Case in point: MINDville@Napiri was 91% vaccinated yet 32 of the 255 staff+residents tested positive.  31/32 were fully vaccinated.  So variants can spread amongst a highly vaccinated population though they hopefully will not get seriously ill (three quarters were asymptomatic).  This of course puts those stubbornly unvaccinated elderly at risk.  One may say that's their own puasa but once the death toll rises sharply, the skittish public takes fright (as opposed to insouciance about several hundred flu deaths each normal year).If you want out of restrictions soon, there's the need for full and frank discussions with the elderly unvaccinated.  Cajole them, appeal to their better nature, scare them, bribe them, whatever, but they need to get jabbed ASAP.</p>

&rt;At a certain point you'll reach a threshold of vaccination where no matter what you do short of making vaccination mandatory, there will be no further uptake. Honestly I'm glad I'm not a politician or in politics because my solution would just be sign up for a vaccine by, for example, 1st July and last that you pay for it yourself. Only people with proof of signing up before this date gets free covid treatment unless you can also show a doctors note showing contraindications.</p>
<p>Basically whatever it takes for them to achieve their xgendx.</p>
<p>go check out their sub and u will find many voicing / in favor of forcing covexjabs down peoples throats.</p></p>
