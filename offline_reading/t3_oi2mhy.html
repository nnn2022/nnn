        <p>Having an outrageous president and obsessing about him for 4 years turned many Americans toward the other side.</p>
<p>Now they are polarizing the vaccines, similarly, and Covid-19 as a whole.</p>
<p>This whole thing began with fear, but it is a "my team against your team" mentality which allows it to continue even after people realize they were lied to.</p>
<p>This is why you see vaccine skepticism exclusively on "far right news networks."</p>
<p>In general, we should appreciate mainstream coverage on our issues -- and without question, Tucker Carlson's monologs on the matter have been brilliant... But remember, he doesn't write those monologs. And FOX and CNN and all the others are not actually opposed to each other. Everything about our system is based on splitting people up into this left/right paradigm.</p>
<p>It's why nothing ever changes, and decade after decade our freedoms wither incrementally and the gap between rich and poor widens with no end.</p>
<p>We should be as distrustful of FOX as any other mainstream news network including, especially, Rolling Stone. None of them actually represent us any more than a politician does. They all work for the same people, same corporations, and same income class.</p>
<p>And those people, those corporations, and that income class works against all working people whether we come from the left or the right.</p>

        <p>100% that our democracy has been twisted the wealthy through their ongoing influence peddling and corruption of the political, legal, and law enforcement systems to provide the illusion of balance when, in fact, the broad public is kept like mushrooms... in the dark and fed shot all the time until they are harvested by the 1% to feed themselves and expand their greed and need for power and gluttony.</p>
