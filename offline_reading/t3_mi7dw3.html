        <p>I know right, it’s almost like you can read the comments without looking. </p>
<p>It made me happy to see people actually raising the point that masks don’t provide protection as it says on the box the masks come in. </p>
<p>Of fucking course those people got instantly downvoted. It’s just so cringy to see cognitive dissonance on full display like that. Those people will argue for hours and hours simply because they would look like the biggest dickheads for putting full faith in something that’s so far far from bulletproof. And they know deep down the truth.</p>

        <p>I saw your PM.  I'm not interested in "opening a dialogue" with people who treat me like I'm sick when I'm healthy.  I'm not interested in "opening a dialogue" where your goal is to convince me to give up my rights.  Why should such a "dialogue" be of any interest to me?</p>
<p>Go ahead and skim through my comments on here to understand how I feel about masks and covid.  That's my half of the "dialogue".  I presume that your half of the "dialogue" would most likely be "obey, comply, stop being selfish" -- My rights, my eyesight, my breath, my freedom of movement and my mental health aren't <strong>selfish</strong>.</p>
<p>I'll never forgive you and people like you for creating a society where every single person who sees me in public treats me like I'm some fucking diseased killer leper, just because their TVs told them it was morally correct to do so.  It isn't.</p>
<ul>
<li>99.97% survival rate.  2020 death counts show no noticeable uptick from 2000-2019.</li>
<li>No mass graves.  No 500% capacity hospitals.  No dead hobos littering the alleys downtown.  No bodies stacked like cord wood on the side of the road.  You wouldn't even know covid existed if the TV wasn't shouting DOOM DOOM DOOM nonstop.  The same media who's been lying to our faces for years definitely isn't lying now though, right?</li>
<li>Shooting and hospice victims counted as covid deaths.  They literally said it out loud:  "Deaths for any cause within 28 days of a positive test" including falling off bridges, suicides, getting hit by cars, heart attacks.  Literally.  Anything.  That "500k+" number is a lie.  I don't like being lied to.</li>
<li>PCR tests aren't accurate.  Erykah Badu had a test in her left nostril come out positive, and a test in her right nostril come out negative.  This is the method by which the media derives their fearmongering "CASES ARE SPIKING" numbers.</li>
<li>Masks literally come with a disclaimer printed on the package that says they don't prevent virus transmission.</li>
<li>Masks are unhygienic bacteria sponges that diaper up all the waste you exhale.  I don't care to smoosh that filth against my lips, thanks.</li>
<li>Fauci:  "Don't wear masks"  Fauci later:  "Actually wear masks, I only said not to because I was <strong>LYING</strong> before.  Lying for a good reason tho!  And I'm definitely not lying now!"</li>
<li>The people in charge who know the most about covid act like it's not even a big deal. ( <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownHypocrites/">LockdownHypocrites (reddit.com)</a> )</li>
<li>Dr. Birx travels to see her family, but I can't.</li>
<li>Gavin Newsome gets to eat at a nice restaurant but every small business in my neighborhood is forcibly closed.</li>
<li>George Floyd got a funeral attended by every politician in DC, my mom didn't get a funeral at all.</li>
<li>And then there was that "opening statement" gif I listed earlier.  Masks are political theatre.  Masks are a tribal religious talisman, used only for the purpose of expressing your own virtue to the rest of the tribe.</li>
<li>Wear a mask while walking to your table, take it off when you sit down, because covid only exists at chest level?  However at church, wear a mask while seated and take it off when you're speaking at the podium.  Because covid only exists in the pews?!  All these rules are obvious bullshit.</li>
<li>People are putting masks on TODDLERS and it's sickening.</li>
<li>My governor made my business ILLEGAL and we had to fire 2000 people.  Amazon and Wal-Mart are doing fine, though.  Aren't we supposed to be upset when wealth is transferred to the 1%?  I guess that all got put on pause because your TV told you to not worry about that this week.</li>
<li>Scapegoating an entire class of people as the reason for all of society's problems is not virtuous, no matter what your TV tells you.</li>
<li>Prior to 2020, treating healthy people as if they were sick was a form of emotional abuse.  Today it's trendy.  Today, <strong>you</strong> want to treat <strong>me</strong> like I'm sick.  I'm not sick.  Stop being so abusive towards total strangers.</li>
<li>Finally, there's <a href="https://youtu.be/jPWYcjypSWo">this important message</a>, which sadly your generation seems to have completely forgotten.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edited to add:  what makes it all worse is any hopeful or optimistic message about how covid isn't really as bad as it's being made out to be will be BANNED as MISINFORMATION and the person who said it must be CANCELLED for DOWNPLAYING this dread disease.  Even if the information came directly from the CDC.  Optimism is outlawed.  Fear and panic are the only emotional levels we're allowed to express.   This is how you know you're the victim of emotional abuse.</p>

        <p>Dude, you could've just told me this in the PM. I explicitly told you and at least two other people in this thread that my goal isn't to change your minds, which you completely ignored. This is part of the reason that people get so polarized over this, and it doesn't need to be this way. Like I told you, if you ever want to talk, I'm here. I genuinely wish you health and happiness.</p>

        <p>What I commented there</p>
<p>I can’t believe this comment section is real. Trust the science? There are studies that say mask do work and studies that say they don’t work. You need to form your own opinion. But we were not allowed to do that and were forced into it immediately. Now over a year later with a 99.7% survival rate we are still being shamed and forced to wear them. The argument of the other side is not that you shouldn’t wear masks, its that you shouldn’t loose our freedom. Everyone here yes you are being controlled. We have been for a long time but this is still just the start.</p>

        <p>There is not a 99,97% survival rate, more along the lines of 2% on average. And death is not the only bad thing that happens to people who are sick. Roughly 40% of people, or even more suffer long-lasting negative health effects, such as heart, lung and brain problems. You won't have to worry about the last one, since you don't seem to have one.</p>

        <p>I'm curious. Do people in this subreddit think masks literally don't work? Like, that for example FFP2 (which are required here in Germany now) simply don't filter out droplets with the virus on it? </p>
<p>Or are you arguing that the use of masks for the public just doesn't make sense? Because I would agree that it usually doesn't make any difference in stores etc. But I think if 2 people are talking to each other for a while it's definitely a good idea if you don't want to spread the disease.</p>
<p>Just wondering what you guys think.</p>

        <p>People are not trained to use masks. Using masks incorrectly may be worse than useless, it may increase your own chances to become contaminated and sick. We don't want anyone to be more likely to become sick with communicable disease.</p>

        <p>I mean, it's not what I would have done, but it is clever that he is basically able to find a hole in the mandate, to show how stupid these mandates actually are.</p>
<p>The shirt I'm not so hyped about. As always I've been saying, the problem with masks is that they are a clear violation of basic human rights, specially the way these mandates has been made. And the fact that there is no really random controlled studies that show the actual impact of masks, and even the best observational studies there are show that even if they worked it wouldn't be that big of a deal, makes things even more egregious, but the mask thing has become more of a "symbol" than an actual thing about rational and good measures to combat a virus.</p>
<p>I agree, it is not really about safety, even thou people who support them believe this to be the reason in a very basic level, but I don't think I can agree with the it is about "Submission &amp; Control" thing,</p>
<p>It is about abuse of power, and a complete disregard for basic civil liberties. It is also a sign of panic, and of how weak minded people actually are.</p>

<p>The mask he’s wearing I love the symbolism, really speaks volumes. The shirt could of been handled more quick and clever even tho he is pretty much right. </p>
<p>It does show abuse of power and highlights weak minded people. However I still feel this couldn’t be anything but planned. </p>
<p>I do feel it’s possible out of pure stupidity but there’s too many “coincidences” which point toward purposeful foul play. </p>

        <p>Have you ever look at a mirror? The guy who tells others that they are "sociopaths" for having strong principles about civil liberties makes you the only douchebag here.</p>
<p>First and foremost, there are many things that can and will kill others, like cars, that I bet you use, but for some reason the same logic doesn't apply there. So no, not because something "saves lives" means that making a law about it isn't a violation of basic human rights.</p>
<p>Secondly, I bet you never though about masks that way before COVID, even thou there are many contagious illnesses that works pretty similar to COVID, and those illnesses killed every year millions around the world. Still, I bet you weren't pushing this mask narrative.</p>
<p>Third. Before last year, and ever at the start of last year, all health organizations were against the usage of masks because there is very limited evidence for them, and since we lived in a world were just preventing a single mild respiratory virus at all and any costs was a thing, it made absolutely no sense to recommend them.</p>

        <p>what do you imagine the government gains from unnecessarily forcing people to wear masks? i understand that you see it as a form of control, but to what end? control for the sake of control? (i’m not trying to judge anyone, i’m genuinely curious and open to discussion)</p>

        <p>Thanks for clarifying you ain’t straight up attacking like most. </p>
<p>I believe it’s obvious conditioning. If you notice as soon as you go to school you are presented with an authority figure, just as much so as your parents. They tell you to get a job and now that you get a job now you have a boss</p>
<p>Since the start there’s always been an authoritative figure and rules to be followed. There’s always been someone HIGHER up than you. </p>
<p>To sum it up.. I feel this is a method to reinforce this energy into our daily lives. It has worked fantastically. </p>
<p>People now worry about not wearing a mask when they go outside. The point is. It’s not about if you should or shouldn’t. It’s that there’s no questioning. You just worry about getting in trouble/covid so you wear a mask. THATS the cleverness. It literally wasn’t an issue at some point but now it’s a full blown reality we probably wouldn’t have believed a year ago. </p>
<p>It should paint a picture that this “follow the rules and also, there’s someone who knows better than you who will look after you” energy is being spread to our own personal bubbles of thought. </p>
<p>Also do you really think, that if all of these rules came out BOOM day one of covid, people would be so easily pushed around? It’s only after so many days do you begin to accept a new reality slowly. </p>
<p>That’s all this has been about.... it’s a scary but very obvious observation that everything is being lined up to go in China’s direction of handling its citizens. it’s very subtle but if you notice patterns easily, you stop believing in coincidence. It’s been happening slowly over the years with different events leading to more strict changes.</p>

        <p>i see your point, but i suppose my response is that there are all sorts of ways that the government/authorities already enforce control, so why specifically masks? and how come EVERY government in the world all decided on the same technique, at the same time. and more broadly with lockdowns/restrictions generally, it seems clear that for the people in power, it’s much better for them that we DON’T lockdown, and keep going to work so we can make money for them. yes in the short term money was made off stock market manipulation etc, but the overall effect on the economy is going to affect the wealthy and powerful too, so i would think that if anything, they would have an incentive to downplay the danger. </p>
<p>Also, China and other authoritarian government have done a perfectly good job of enforcing power over people in the past without using masks/lockdowns, so i don’t feel like they would need to do this in order to gain power.</p>

        <p>Westerners are more responsive to that. If you ACTUALLY see how things are in China... there’s no way people in western upbringings would put up with it. Seriously </p>
<p>Consider the possibility there is no separation in government and key leaders, including rich benefactors, have formed a small group in thought/effort of one simple objective which is keep the HUGE amount of people in line.  </p>
<p>In terms of the economy and keeping everyone at work you raise a very good point, I would have backed up a year ago. However I feel now they are loosing grip with control as it is very cliche almost to know that the government is corrupt and untrustworthy. </p>
<p>how do we fix this common standpoint everyone mostly agrees on? do what they have always done.. create an issue and supply a solution. They did it with the war on terror and Vietnam was just a joke... </p>
<p>the next move is a giant catastrophe event that will basically force everyone into the trusting arms of a NEW reliable government which is incorruptible. THATS the old new world order theory. It just seems very obvious we are heading in that direction. Or just a simple catastrophe which reinforces “we are in this together” </p>
<p>My main point is a small group of people are hell bent on staying in power and keeping everything the same as it is, BUT they must have realised it would grow old so they would need to create anything to keep it going EVEN if it means changing everything. </p>
<p>I feel they actually want to crash the economy and start over but how they still stay rich/in power after that is a guess. Main point is old system ain’t gon cut it after awhile</p>

        <p>i see your point, but i still think it seems unlikely that EVERY country in the world would unanimously decide to go along with the same conspiracy in the name of increasing control over their native populations. especially considering that a lot of countries rely on tourist revenue etc, it seems unlikely that they would sacrifice that for some nebulous idea of power/submission. 
also i feel that the idea that western civilisation would seriously resist authoritarian takeover is unfortunately a fantasy, if you look at a lot of western countries (example USA or UK)they seem all too ready to accept increasing police/government powers as long as they seem to be being wielded against the “right” people (people of colour, protesters, travellers etc). 
also if you look at brazil for example, they have quite an authoritarian government who refused, and still refuse, to address the COVID pandemic at all in the name of economic power/ trying to project a sense of strength against something that all the other global powers are really suffering with, reinforcing my idea that real authoritarians want to downplay the pandemic in order to seem stronger than other countries.</p>

        <p>You raise a good point and I think they probably want to implement there own to look after those countries. </p>
<p>Look what happened Tanzania, the president was very sceptical of the whole covid hitch and seemed like he didn’t buy into it. </p>
<p>According to London news outlets he died of covid. Whereas local news ruled it as heart failure. </p>
<p>You are correct in that they couldn’t possibly get everyone on their side but, I still feel they are trying really hard. To me it shows pretty obvious.</p>

        <p>Mask mandates are simple visible tool that governments use:</p>
<ul>
<li>to distract people from more important issues that are not being addressed</li>
<li>to create the illusion of action</li>
<li>to create visible out-groups of people that can be blamed, and </li>
