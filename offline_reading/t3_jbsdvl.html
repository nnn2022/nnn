    <strong>Fireworks increasing again. UK</strong>
    <p><p>At the start of the first lockdown, fireworks were happening a ridiculous amount every night. It had only settled down next to nothing 2 months ago or something. </p>
<p>Now they're back!  From fricken 10pm onwards. I was woken up at 2am lastnight by them. </p>
<p>What is it with them? How are they even getting them? </p>
<p>It was bad enough the few weeks build up to bonfire night, but this is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>My poor dogs are terrified every single night.</p></p>
