        <p>The certainly did, but they don't expect you to look and see that is what they actually did. Just want you focused on unvaccinateds being the devil so you pressure them into taking it, so we can all be part of the collective.</p>

        <p>The NYT has committed another assault on minds of the masses. Just look at the headline. How is this being framed? What is the objective?</p>
<p>The article sets out to pin an outbreak on someone who wouldn't vaccinate. So, you are to feel shame that YOU might be a super spreader. Better get jabbed because you don't want to have that on your conscience. </p>
<p>Ironically, they don't know WHO is responsible for the outbreak. Could've been someone vaccinated. We're supposed to believe one unvaccinated infected each individual, personally, and no fully vaccinateds were part of the chain? No. </p>
<p>What is being missed? Oh, 22 breakthrough cases? Don't look at the fact seniors aren't being protected and the jabs aren't working. We have another story to get you on that. </p>
<p>Framing is so critical and NYT is holding exculpatory evidence to convict your mind. 22 out of how many? Simple request. NYT too busy to provide because you don't want to know the average beds in a state run facility is 61. Much less in private at 24. The story is the jabs aren't working but...</p>
<p>At the same time, a study is released on STUDENTS and staff at university that only 2 out of 417 experienced breakthrough cases. Framed as how well the jabs are holding up. </p>
<p>So, they used STUDENTS to make you believe this applies to EVERYONE, and used the ELDERLY to make you believe YOU are a super spreader and potential killer. </p>
<p>If presented honestly, people would be awfully worried that 22 out of ?? people had their jabs fail after being told how wonderfully protected they were. </p>
<p>Real thinking is a lost art.</p>

        <p>They've been attacking the unvaccinated exactly like this for years. It's usually the vaccinated shedding that causes the outbreak. This is why NY no longer allows religious exemptions. They want total compliance with vaccines for school and now they are using the same strategy on the rest of the population.</p>

        <p>This is really going to ramp up as demand has dried up for vaccines. As Gottlieb recently said, we will get to 150 million but he doesn't see 160. </p>
<p>So, what do you do? Turn up the heat. Write loaded headlines like the Times did that completely blows by a MAJOR ISSUE...seniors not protected from the virus after being fully vaccinated. </p>
<p>Also, the framing with kids has completely flipped. Kids used to be used by the media as what? SUPER SPREADERS!!! </p>
<p>Now, that they can be vaccinated, what are they framed as?  GETTING SICK!!!!</p>
<p>Kids have ALWAYS gotten sick during the pandemic. The messaging has all of a sudden shifted to them getting sick because they can now be vaccinated. They frame this story so hard and rigidly only a fool couldn't see this is less real than "Reality" TV.</p>
