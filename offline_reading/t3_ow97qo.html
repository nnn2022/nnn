    <strong>The current situation in Sydney, Australia</strong>
    <p><p>Afternoon Reddit folk,</p>
<p>Just need to vent/Rant - Apologies if its TL;DR or a bit Rambly</p>
<p>So the current situation in Sydney, Australia is :</p>
<p>We are Balls deep in Delta strain according to the media, in a city of 6ish million people, we are at our "peak cases" at the moment which is circa 200 each day give or take. Daily testing is 100K tests per day..</p>
<p>We are just entering week fucking 6 of Hard lockdown, Cannot go further than 5km, mandatory mask wearing inside, mandatory QR track and trace codes at every place of businesses.</p>
<p>No Domestic or International travel in or out of the country permitted at all.</p>
<p>All Gyms are closed, All retail closed (bar "essential groceries etc") All construction and non essential trades (plumbing, electrical, building etc) ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE OR FACE FINES.</p>
<p>You can't have any visitors to your household at all, you can't visit anyone regardless of relationship or risk heavy fines and penalties.</p>
<p>As of today the rolled out the AUSTRALIAN DEFENSE FORCE to local areas to "enforce compliance"</p>
<p>pray for the people of Australia reddit, we are so well and truely fucked.... </p>
<p>businesses are done, gone, caput. but I will be ok.</p>
<p>Many others I feel won't be ok, and the even scarier thing is. there is still more to come.</p>
<p>Hope your all doing better than me, I'm loosing my fucking mind.</p></p>

        <p>Oh no, it's not martial law. I know this because the news told me it doesn't fit a very narrow and specific definition given by the US government. So we're all just conspiracy nuts. Nothing to see here. Move along now. Obey your overlords.</p>

        <p>Right. Ignore the helicopters overhead. Stay in your homes. This is NOT martial law.</p>

        <p>Neighbor turning against neighbor.  People who have known each other for years, whose children have played together, suddenly divided by rising cycles of suspicion, hate, and violence.  Why does this sound familiar?

        <p>I'm always surprised by people who are surprised that this shit happens.</p>
<p>The majority of people are absolute fucking wankers, who will turn on their neighbors in a second. It has been born out time after time (look at Austria and Germany -- the first countries to turn on Jews, report their neighbors, herd them into ghettos, and exterminate them.</p>
<p>And people still shockingly believe this couldn't happen where they are. </p>
<p>I have already made my decision, and it will eventually be a cabin in the woods away from the majority of the planet. I hate most people at this point and, if half of them were suddenly annihilated by a virus (sadly, Covid isn't it), I wouldn't shed a tear.</p>

        <p>Bro I too will have my cabin far away and have thought most as absolute wankers but I feel that may be too harsh. </p>
<p>Most people aren’t critical thinkers, self aware enough to see the larger machine they’re an inherent part of. If you are then I believe you should try to view the rest with empathy and compassion not hatred.</p>
<p>Not for you but for the world because even though they are fucking wankers, hate makes it easier to divide us - kindness converts and unifies.</p>

        <p>Last year an anonymous neighbor narced and called the police on a kids birthday party.  All the kids (maybe 6-8) were from the same neighborhood and played together daily.  The state set a maximum of around 15 people per gathering.  I guess COVID19 only is infectious at 16 or more people.  The police actually came and did a head count and said they were embarrassed to even have to come.  This was in RI USA.  Narcs everywhere.  It’s almost like they hate freedom or something.</p>

        <p>Some do.  Some go along with it much like they are doing in Australia.  “Just following orders” is the excuse.  Same defense was used before by war criminals.  Just saying. 
Not equating war criminals with the police who responded to the call in this case.  But if you reflect on much of the news of the last year we can see examples of how some police have participated in the COVID19 tyranny.</p>

        <p>You remember how everyone was cautious of martial law half a decade ago? Well martial law was never going to arrive by force. That was never their idea. If it happened to quickly and of it was too obvious, their plan would have failed.</p>
<p>No, here’s how you institute martial law: you don’t. Your let the people do that for you. That was their entire plan all along. COVID was what they needed to make the people institute martial against their own unsuspecting will. </p>
<p>People are allowing this, and they are creating martial law, while the (other) ones are sitting back and watching the show.</p>

        <p>Keep on keeping on.</p>
<p>Because eventually you will have the satisfaction of seeing your insane governmental officials kicked out of office and then arrested.</p>
<p>All of these fuckers, with their insane lockdowns now destroying countries' economies will end up reaping the rewards for their lunacy for the rest of their lives. I am absolutely convinced of that.</p>

        <p>I have a travel exemption for scare skills. Was granted about 6 weeks ago. So they would let me in if I could find a flight. But that's out the window now with this latest lockdown and flight capacity restrictions. I want to get in before vaccinations are required as an entry-requirement.</p>

        <p>This is astonishing, after a year and a half of this “pretend it’s the plague” when it’s really not, the majority are still buying it and crawling on their bloody knees to obey. If the people were smart, they would just QUIT TAKING the tests!!
Doing that would end all this!</p>
<p>What Happened to this world’s intelligence! Australia is only getting so slammed with restrictions because they have an ocean mote (1000 times more effective than the Berlin Wall)
It’s so scary that the government has had this influence and complete compliance. I’m definitely sending out prayers, super energy vibes, positive thoughts, and super angry thoughts, anything that will help!</p>

<p>A lot of places around the world have had first hand experience with COVID enough to decide the threat level is less than the narrative suggests.</p>
<p>Australia has had success with COVID to the point where we haven't really experienced it yet, so all the information people have to go on is the fear-mongering of the media.</p>
<p>Once COVID finally gets to a point where it is no longer containable and out in the community, people will finally begin to see how trivial it is.</p>

        <p>Hey man, I have relatives in Sydney. They're getting totally reamed at this point. With a young family I am not sure how they are brining in enough money to make ends meet. They're not the type to ask for help, but I'm not sure how long they can last.</p>
<p>For some reason the overlords in NSW think that a) 200 cases in a population of 6 million is a massive problem, and b) that if locking down didn't help, maybe locking down will help. Asinine. The longer this goes on the less likely it is going to help as more and more people reach their breaking point.</p>

        <p>I have a huge side of me that hopes they reach their breaking point, because (really though, no offense to OP of any was taken, because I really don’t know how Australian’s are in general everyday life since I don’t live there) people on the Right want to “be on the good side of history” but all their passiveness and signature “lack of violence because we’re not Left” is getting the best of them.</p>
<p>Eventually you’ll have to use violence if things keep regressing, so…. What’s going to give…..? </p>
<p>It’s just an honest question I have circulating on my mind recently… I’m just tired of people not having the guts to not be scared of physically dragging their “elected” officials out of their offices, but the collar, and publicly humiliating them and putting them in their place. They’re like children without a parent. A child with access to everything and never being stopped.</p>
<p>They need to be emotionally stimulated in a very, very dark way that shows them what REAL FEAR looks like. Give them a glimpse into what hellfire feels like. And this hellfire of the human spirit when assembled in order for the greater good. Nothing is possible, but I believe that your average Joe is simply too afraid of everything that could go wrong, and this is preventing them from having the faith to take critical action.</p>
<p>Not saying to murder anyone. I’m just irritated that Biden might lock the US down again, so I’m really contemplating when people will finally span.</p>

        <p>I agree but their excuse is always: well if we didn't lock down there would be 1000's of cases.</p>
<p>It is nuts. The CDC have said that their emergency use for the PCR test (which expires at the end of the year), needs to change because they need a test that can differentiate sarscov2 and influenza better: https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html</p>

<p>That's the claim, but inevitably and pragmatically that's what has to be. The dream of eradicating COVID in Australia is, at this point, but a wet dream of a teenager. </p>
<p>The focus should be on hospitalization and serious illness and protecting the vulnerable (it always should have been and people were saying this &rt; 12 months ago), but, the weak minded fools running the country, listening to academics who couldn't model their way out of a wet paper bag, seem to prefer draconian measures in lieu of practical ones. None of them are in touch with reality. Not even close.</p>

        <p>That's absolutely correct.  The current test will only give a positive or negative for covid.  So if you ended up negative and wanted to test for flu you would need get a separate test.  The new test can differentiate between covid and the flu in one test.</p>
<p>It's referred to as the multiplexed method.</p>

        <p>The other argument used for it being a fraud is the fact it has never been isolated, and has needed a computer model to support the claim. I read an article recently which basically refuted this claim by mentioning that Koch's postulates is over 120 years old and, that the criteria that needs to be met has changed, and that covid19 has been isolated, just not in the traditional sense. To be honest I have been yoyoing quite a bit recently. It's just that both sides of the narrative have convincing arguments.</p>

        <p>That's not what it says at all, they want a test that can do both at the same time to better track the flu as well.  This will help places select which flu vaccines will work better in which areas depending on the current strains going around.  If everyone is getting tested constantly anyways may as well use it.</p>

        <p>Okay that makes sense. My misunderstanding. So they want a test that does both to see if the person has either the flu or covid? Does that not demonstrate that they have lost track of the flu because, all eyez on covid.</p>
<p>See I don't really understand how PCR can even differentiate viruses. If we look at the bigger picture, PCR testing isn't the most reliable diagnostic.

        <p>Mexico is great. As long as you’re not a complete peasant you can live like a king here with a six figure savings. We have the best food and climate in the world. In the nicer neighborhoods of CDMX, electricity, water and Internet are reliable. I’d rather live in Mexico City over Australia any day. </p>

        <p>Sure, CDMX is great. It's actually one of my favorite cities in the world. But CDMX is not representative of Mexico as a whole. I grew up not far from Tiajuana and spent lots of time in Mexico and Baja. There's a reason there's such strong border protection leaving Mexico vs entering.</p>

        <p>Lol. Fair point. The last time I was in CDMX (2019), I couldn't help but notice how much nicer it was vs Los Angeles. Of course, LA is a shit hole, but I kept thinking "where are all the homeless?!". It took me awhile but it dawned on me that they're all up in the hills surrounding CDMX in the shanty villages as opposed to just littering the streets like in LA.</p>

        <p>I say with real confidence that there won’t be any more COVID lockdowns in the UK.</p>
<p>I think we’re well past any possible justification for it. Given most of the adult population is vaccinated, it would be entering completely new territory if the government institute another lockdown.</p>
<p>Plus the Conservative government has a large anti-lockdown lobby within its own party, and Boris Johnson wants his ‘world leading vaccination programme’ to be somewhat of a legacy of his. If we lockdown again, that’s out of the window and everyone will be asking “where do we go from here?”</p>
<p>Also, we didn’t lockdown because of the delta variant, it just delayed some easing of restrictions by a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I can now legally go anywhere in the country without wearing a mask, and although many shops still ask that you wear them, things are feeling much more like normality.</p>

        <p>I had a smug AF classmate on social media claiming last year that Europe “took things seriously” and “handled COVID” and could now move on and live life normally. Same with Reddit. For a long time, saying that Europe didn’t eradicate COVID would get you the downvote brigade and a ton of rage filled comments. And mentioning Sweden…..Well. Look at Europe now.</p>

        <p>Having guns only matters if the people are ready to use them. An armed population just means they have to move slower with more tact and careful manipulation then somewhere like Australia. </p>
<p>If the constant propaganda they bludgeon us with keeps the majority brainwashed and mentally disarmed, America having guns won’t save it. It’s more likely we turn our guns on each other in civil war with how divided everyone is.</p>

        <p>Dude… you are absolutely correct. Assuming they don’t take all our guns away first. It baffles me that people put so much trust in politicians. So many people believe that nobody should own firearms. And those same people believe the government should be in charge of our health decisions, which businesses can be open, when you can leave your home, when you can see loved ones. It’s very sad.</p>

<p>I am not saying it to be harsh, it must be recognised for another way to be seen and then acted upon.</p>
<p>Elections will not change anything.</p>
<p>People must stand up and say NO. It may already be too late, down under.</p>

<p>And some people in various countries have been noncompliant, getting fined/locked up and fighting it in court.</p>
<p>Logic shows that either you make a stand when a fine is what you're up against, or wait.... And be faced with imprisonment, or worse as the price for not complying. It's only going to get worse.</p>

        <p>We have very low vaccination rates, I am not currently eligible to be vaccinated and protected. I live in a household with older parents with pre existing health conditions who also aren’t eligible for the vaccine. So you bet I’m complying and not bringing Covid home that could be fatal.

        <p>We had no Covid cases for a very long time therefore we became complacent and didn’t push for it, we thought we got away with missing a large outbreak. Now we have delta that’s twice as contagious and health services as well as the population aren’t prepared. They are pushing very hard for the vaccines now, my state doing 80k doses in a day which is good for us.</p>
<p>The only caveat being Pfizer is in very low stock while AstraZeneca is abundant. My age range is not available for Pfizer yet as they are prioritising over 40s and emergency workers. I am also advised against receiving AstraZeneca therefore my hands are tied until I can get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Low on stock when some countries have over 150 million doses? A cold that wiped out hundreds of thousands of Europeans/Americans prior to being vaccinated? The government is losing billions daily and copping heat constantly especially leading up to an election. This isn’t some ploy to keep us inside. Take your tin foil hat off mate.</p>

        <p>Monkey is right. Cdc already admitted that only 6% are actual covid, and even that is false because of the number of cycles they ran the test through. Most of them were probably the flu, being as the flu disappeared for the last 18 months. Here is the cdc link. Check out sections V for car crashes and X for gun deaths...</p>

        <p>YouTube just suspended Sky News Australia for a week for questioning lockdowns and vaccines.</p>
<p>The problem is, all of big business is in on it too, including all social media, so Aussies are pretty much fucked unless they get out on the streets in their millions.</p>

        <p>I have heard that also, but couldn’t confirm if it’s true or not. Wouldn’t shock me though. I do personally know people that have been very vocal in anti lockdown/vacc on social media being visited by the police and questioned. 
Some of them who went to the last protest got a $1000 fine for breaching the NSW health mandate laws</p>

        <p>Sydneysider here. I am lucky enough to be in full time work throughout this "pandemic" and subsequent lock down..I know people are doing it much much harder than me. </p>
<p>This is fucked here. All I here on the news 24 hours a day is that the ONLY way out of this is get vaccinated.  We are never opening up till 80% of people are vaccinated we are told. This however is not a guarantee.  This is what people don't understand.  Our premier said 6 weeks ago that until 80% of NSW is vaccinated then she won't even have a conversation about opening up until then. That is only a conversation., not promising anything. </p>
<p>We are trapped here for the long term. </p>

        <p>Australia had a really good socialist style stimulus last year which saved the economy and lives, but this time around the federal government had been really against stimuli because they didn’t want lockdowns to happen. Once it became obvious that lockdowns prevent massive spread and huge economic damage, they’ve started reintroducing them</p>

<p>I feel with the lockdowns + low vaccination rates, Australia probably hasn't developed much herd immunity --which in turn could open itself up to worse problems down the line.</p>

        <p>It sure does! Most states in Australia apart from NSW (where OP is from) got delta (from Sydney) and have managed to contain the spread very effectively with a swift lockdown and really good contact tracing.</p>
<p>I’m in Melbourne and we did two weeks of hard lockdown and have gone back to 1-2 cases a day, with nearly every case fully isolated during their entire infectious period. Edit: we had harder restrictions than Sydney currently has (apart from construction) but when we got most cases isolating during infection period, we’ve reopened cafes restaurants and bars etc. we’ve managed it so well, that my parents tried to book a restaurant in the city on Friday and after five hours calling places, couldn’t secure a booking until Wednesday! The city is booming again (in a covid safe manner). Considering that Sydney and Melbourne started at the same point (known index cases caught within days of becoming infectious) but Melbourne actually had two simultaneous seperate outbreaks, the numbers are telling. Sydney went from 1 case to &rt;200 a day because of delaying lockdowns, while Melbourne has gone from  a few seeding events (2 cases due to removalalists who came from Sydney and another family who went shopping while positive) to averaging 2 cases a day because we locked down within a couple of days of finding the first cases (peaked at around 24 cases in a day). edit 2: we can’t visit our mates at their homes just yet, but will be able to in a week. However, for now we can get on the beers in a pub (because of signing in with QR code’s it allows any positive cases to be contact traced so any future infections can be isolated) or have some cheeky beers at the park :) things are pretty great honestly</p>
<p>Absolutely agreed with your second point - our federal government fucked up BADLY with vaccinations. We are waiting until September until we start seeing a decent flow of Pfizer vaccines, and the plan is that once we have decent vaccine coverage lockdowns will be used less and less.</p>
<p>Edit 4: have to say though lockdowns are fucking DRAINING. I did four months straight last year of hard lockdown, one that makes Sydney’s seem easy. I would see army personnel doing patrols while out for my hour per day walk. It took a huge toll on my mental health. However, the government expanded our healthcare to allow for 12 psychologist visits a year to be half price. It made all the difference honestly! Edit 5 for clarity: the defence force were friendly as hell! Always polite, never taking advantage of being a military force. They’d stop, have a chat and ask how I’m doing, if my mental health is alright and offer me a fresh mask or hand sanitiser. When lockdowns started easing, they’d walk by me and my friends having a drink in the local park (no alcohol zone) and rather than abusing their power, they’d be super friendly and say things like “enjoy your beers mates! You’ve bloody earned em!”. Then when lockdown ended, they went back to their barracks throughout the country and resumed their normal duties. It was nowhere close to marshal law :)</p>

<p>Australia has had less than 1,000 deaths in a country of 25 million; almost 18 months of strict lock-downs so severe that your government is offering discount psychiatry over a virus with a 97%+ survival rate, even if you're unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Well the reason why we had less than a thousand deaths is because of the lockdowns, and the compliance to the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Honestly we have been living really free and relaxed for the most part. There’s only been a few hairy moments.</p>
<p>We got discounted mental health services because thankfully our normally right wing government understood how necessary it was, and that we needed support that went further than just money. The big failure has been the removal of the monetary support which has really fucked areas like Sydney which so desperately need it.</p>
<p>We temporarily forfeited a lot of our liberties and in return, regained our liberties and a sense of peace knowing that we could see our elderly population and not put them at risk - which is something barely anywhere else in the world could do. We got so so so much in return. We got to live through the global pandemic in a state of relative ease and lack of fear. I would take this approach to the let it rip approaches that failed spectacularly across the world.</p>

        <p>"Temporarily forfeited" --says who? Has your government announced any hard dates when the lockdowns will be completely lifted? You haven't regained anything yet. </p>
<p>They could have just quarantined the elderly over 65 and at-risk groups instead of the entire population; and if you do get COVID under the age of 65, survival jumps to 99%. </p>

        <p>Well, the fact police would make their presence felt at a lockdown protest is telling in itself --that Australia is under a militarized lockdown, and that Australians don't value their liberty enough to push for it.  In which case, Thereux's quote is correct and compliment's Franklin's. </p>
<p>Regarding "Long COVID" --I'm far from anti-vaxxer (I'm vaccinated, since May) however that term and condition rings more as a media creation; there are long-term effects of COVID (ie: loss of taste, fatigue) but it seems no more common than long term side-effects of the vaccine (meaning both aren't widespread).  I had severe COVID in March 2020 as did a co-worker; we both recovered after two weeks with no long term effects. A few other co-workers had some mild cold symptoms --everyone else was fine. And this was during the March/April "surge" before lockdowns, masks and distancing in a major US city. </p>
<p>Not to be negative, but if I was a gambling person I bet you won't be drinking in pub in two weeks, or even two months from now.</p>

        <p>FR like everyone on there is dying for an even tougher lockdown. What more do they want? Its not normal. Human beings are not meant to be isolated for long periods of time. This shit is truly fucked. And 99.9% of us are going to be completely unaffected by this disease, but we're losing our livelihoods and mental health thanks to these laws</p>

        <p>Jumping in here it’s basically reporting criminal activity in an anonymous form. There’s a website, telephone number. When the protests happened, the police, politicians etc urged people to use it to track down protesters. I also think there was a reddit page created to dob people in..</p>

        <p>Saw a video the other day. Some guy in Sydney posted on FB - the context was not clear - his page, or someone else's - that he thought if the lock downs continued that someone might snap and put a bullet in one of the politicians. He didn't say he was going to do it. He didn't advocate for anyone to do it. He was basically saying what everyone else with a brain is thinking, that eventually someone will snap. That night armed police stormed his house and arrested him, and apparently he's facing 3 years' jail. If he gets convicted, it sets an absolutely mind boggling precedent.</p>

        <p>Can you explain the logic of Australia? Could the old "former penal colony" mindset coming into play?</p>
<p>Also, with such a successful, prolonged lockdown why didn't the government do a hardcore vaccine drive? From what I've read, Australia is only at around 11% vaccinated.</p>
<p>It's like the country has become a fortress and just plans to....wait a few years for COVID to run it's course.</p>

        <p>I sometimes think that Australians for the most part as such a young nation (compared to Europe/USA/etc) we have never really had to fight for rights or anything.. Yes we have been in wars, but always piggy backing as an Allied force, never a civil uprising or anything like that.</p>
<p>so I think the complacency to challenge the government is inbuilt, as we are pretty laid back as a nation.</p>
<p>there current rhetoric at the moment is they won't let us out of lockdown until we are 80% vaccinated... :(</p>

        <p>That's an interesting point, I think Canada suffers from that same mindset in many ways --Canada just sorta "came into existence" via various treaties and military skirmishes. </p>
<p>To America's credit, the very creation of the US in itself was an act of rebellion --that spirit of independence is woven not just throughout the Constitution but also in the way Americans carry themselves. It's that feature of American culture that gives me hope that a rejection of fear and a return to normalcy has a chance.</p>

        <p>Absolutely agree (also Australian). I don't know many adults in my workplace or local community who even follow politics seriously- especially my family. They think I'm 'weird' for wanting to talk or care about world issues. They are very happily ignorant and my Mum told me yesterday when I was trying to once again evoke some emotion into her or anyone in my family  about the whole thing- "its awful I know but we just have to do what we are told, so no point trying to think about it because youll never be able to make sense of it". Gave me chills. Most Australians have always been told they live in the 'lucky country' and always hear how good we have it so most of the population just refuses to acknowledge anything that says differently.</p>

        <p>They're grabbing you by the balls. The “vaccine” doesn't do shit and it's the cause for variants. They're gonna keep you on lockdown forever unless you people make a revolution...a real revolution. There is only way available to “negotiate” with your government...don't make me say it explicitly, but that's the only thing you can do that's gonna gain your freedom back with the kind of government you got in place. Unless most other countries in the world get out of it first and decide to forcefully intervene in your country then that's the only thing you can do.</p>

<p>We've made the decision to leave Australia and go back to America (wife's from there). Going to start applying for exemption to leave and hope we get it. But thanks to ScoMo, a one way ticket to SFO from SYD for a family of 5 is going to cost us $26,000 AUD in airfares.</p>
<p>We'll leave for a few years and come back when shit (hopefully) has gone back to normal.</p>

        <p>Don't go back. By going back you eventually support all of this bullshit.</p>
<p>Just leave and stay left. The U.S. isn't perfect at the moment, but life is pretty much normal in most places (as long as you avoid California) and, once Biden is gone (and he is absolutely a one-term to half-a-term president), the Republicans will sort this shit out in no time.</p>
<p>I've been a Democrat my whole life, and I can't wait for the Republicans to get in and start banging heads. Will be proud to vote Repub for the first time at the next election, just to get these mask-mandating, vaccine-obsessed, lockdown-promoting liberal assholes out of office.</p>

<p>Also I hate to break it to you, but you clearly haven’t been paying attention. The republicans are in bed with the democrats. They’re a uniparty that worked together to oust trump with fraud and the republicans made zero attempt to contest it or demand real audits of the fraud.</p>

<p>That was like my last hope of ever being able to escape to live life. Considering the only other real way if you don't have a foreign passport/wife is to already have a job lined up overseas which is nearly impossible if you aren't in a highly skilled occupation.</p>

        <p>&rt;ey mate. Yeah they just started this garbage up here in Brissy, but no army yet. Totally predictable.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We've made the decision to leave Australia and go back to America (wife's from there). Going to start applying for exemption to leave and hope we get it. But thanks to ScoMo, a one way ticket to SFO from SYD for a family of 5 is going to cost us $26,000 AUD in airfares.<br>

&rt;We'll leave for a few years and come back when shit </p>

        <p>So sorry to hear that. Have there been protests? The problem seems that they are so set on keeping it out when it’s impossible and clearly the jabs barely work. Eventually they will have to see reason and I am guessing most people are fed up. Canada is pretty bad in places but not like that. How can they stop people leaving? Terrible. Hoping sanity prevails soon.</p>

        <p>there was a super large protest a few weeks back (I think there are some posts in this /r about it), government and police stated it was 3500 people, it was more closer to 40k people. </p>
<p>The unfortunate part is Aus being an island, you have to fly to get out, so they just dont allow planes to leave with passengers for the most part</p>

        <p>We need protests with millions to make any sort of splash, sadly. People here think 40k is "a lot" but, in the grand scheme of things, it's really not. The protests also need to happen more frequently in areas like in front of governmental buildings and politicians' homes.</p>

        <p>You're not alone!</p>
<p>I think most people genuinely believe we are going back to 'normal' once 80% are vaccinated. The same thing was said about 'flattening the curve'. Which is bonkers because now the CDC are saying that the vaccine doesn't do much for the delta variant (TGA will eventually follow suit).</p>
<p>They are slowly breaking peoples boundaries and covertly weakening them. It's really sad just how many are acquiescing to all of it. No doubt it's a cultural thing though. We have had it too good for too long.</p>
<p>I have witnessed people go from a strong suspicion on everything and opposition to the vax, to eventually submitting to the propaganda,  and not from the media, but from those around them who fell prey to the media.</p>
<p>It sucks, but at least there are still many out there who continue to question, observe, and look into things.</p>

        <p>As a fellow Aussie in Brisbane, I so feel you. We've just been put into a hard lockdown too. First, it was three days, now a week, and I'm fully expecting it to last even longer. Can't go more than 10km and only out for essentials. This is after we had mandatory masks everywhere for nearly a month, which obviously doesn't do a single thing to "nip it in the bud" (God I hate that stupid saying). I'm just relaxing and watching movies lol That's all you can do.</p>

        <p>More power to you. I know exactly what you are going through.</p>
<p>We are about to face the same here in Manila, Philippines, when the region goes under Enhanced Community Quarantine again for two weeks.</p>
<p>We all know what two weeks means.</p>
<p>Last year this famous two weeks lasted for many months and I got stuck between two apartments with no internet connection because nobody was allowed in to install it at the new place. This time I am better prepared.</p>
<p>The situation here is going to be very similar, again.</p>
<p>The cases nationwide are around 8,000 daily and the capital region accounts to about 15-20% of the population. ICUs are at around 50%. Delta is a threat to human existence here. The goal is to vaccinate 250,000 persons per day during lockdown as opposed to 120,000 per day normally. Door-to-door vaccination was suggested but the idea has been rejected, for now.</p>
<p>All retail to be closed except essential ones, ie. grocery. Restaurants for take-out only. Gyms closed, but I think barbershops will be allowed to operate this time, not sure tho.</p>
<p>Curfew will be from 8pm till 4am.</p>
<p>Mandatory QR tracking in every establishment, including residential buildings. Additionally, a quarantine pass will be issued by local government unit, which allows for one, named person per household to go out for essentials.</p>
<p>No visitors allowed in the building since March 2020. Essential maintenance/installation services will require approval from building administration.</p>
<p>Lots of businesses have closed already since last year's lockdown, tons of vacant retail and office space available. Rental rates have fallen 20% back to 2018 levels. No sales on real estate yet, though.</p>
<p>People falling into poverty left and right. Lots have started doing all kinds of shady things online to make ends meet. I know many who are genuinely afraid they cannot get a job or be allowed to travel if they don't take the jab. Those who have already gotten it are totally pissed off now that they don't have the privileges to move around freely.</p>
<p>This is all so crazy and I'm afraid it will only get worse till it gets better.</p>

<p>I hope it doesn’t get worse for you, but I can honestly see it getting worse. Over here in the United States, Biden is considering locking this country down again……so you (might) not be the only one with a locked down country here soon…….</p>

        <p>Bruh. Australia and NZ seems freaking nightmares with lockdowns as soon as there is one case. Not that it's much better here in Europe eh... But not as bad</p>
<p>This bubble strategy that Australia and NZ are trying to pursue is completely useless... No anticorps at all and we're seeing from SEA how you'll have sooner or later a big wave... Even if you postpone it with lockdowns, if no one has anticorps and everyone lives in a bubble, when it arrives it'll be much worse.</p>
<p>I don't understand why people don't take UK as an example. No restrictions, no masks, cases of the scary scary delta variant already peaked and are going down sharply after zero measures taken. Guess why... Building immunity is the best way to get out of this.</p>

        <p>A good point, I was thinking the same --at least in US/UK there is a mix of vaccination and herd immunity. Once AUS and NZ open up, being in a bubble is only going to make them more vulnerable.</p>

<p>The delta variant may exist, I have no idea, but what I can tell you is I doubt very seriously that they have real numbers for how many cases are out there.</p>

        <p>I live in Denmark. We’ve been opening up and lifting restrictions the last couple of months. Of a population og ca. 6 million, today there were 785 new infected, and it’s been around 1000 a couple of weeks ago. Sounds like a lot, but people don’t really get that sick, so they don’t go to hospital. No need to panic about the number of infected, as long as people don’t need hospitalisation. We’re still opening up in the next few months. But still some places require covid-passport</p>

        <p>So you just confirmed people are still coming in from overseas? Citizens can carry the virus too, and we are still unvaccinated. There were Melbourne cases linked to Sri Lanka and the Sydney driver had a strain that was consistent with the one found in the USA.</p>

        <p>I’m saying, international travel has not “commenced” !
It’s been nearly completely shutdown, very restricted, since only citizens are being brought home and very few at that. And then they have to quarantine for two weeks.</p>

        <p>Correct, however the airport driver was shuffling international travellers from the airport to their hotels both unvaccinated and without a mask. Unfortunately there are many reports of NSW investigating breached hotel quarantines, probably much more enforced and regulated now at this current moment however it should have been that way the whole time.</p>

        <p>That's pretty heavy handed. I don't know if the USA will go to such drastic measures as to use the military on its own citizens but at this point it wouldn't surprise me. We might be entering a time where the second amendment might actually be used specifically as written, for the citizens to protect themselves from the government.</p>

        <p>Come out in droves and ignore the lockdowns. If they fine you, don't pay it. Defy them at every turn. They can't enforce this if just 1,000 people stand up all at once and refuse to comply. They really don't have that many police to enforce these policies with. We are many they are few. Stick together and stand strong. United we stand divided we fall.</p>

        <p>This entire year here in Canada we have had to endure the naive, howling masses preach about how aUsTrAlIa Is BaCk To NoRmAl due to strict lockdowns and draconian policies ("oh why can't we get more draconian policies here please daddy Trudeau!", They cried).</p>
<p>I always asked them how Australia would do if the virus re-entered the country.  But I was dismissed as a "conspiracy theorist" and a "moron".</p>
<p>And of course, like just about everything else this year.  We've been proven exactly right yet again.  But of course, no one will admit that.  No one will apologize.  They won't even acknowledge they've been wrong the whole time, and we've been right.  The <em>whole time</em>.</p>
<p>It's all very tiring.  I feel sad for you in Australia.  But we all know what this means for us in Canada: We have probably only about a month left of freedom.</p>

        <p>That makes no sense! 200 cases / day for a country of 25M people. In Denmark it’s 3x more cases, with 5x fewer people and the government is removing pretty much all requirements for masks and tests. Nothing makes sense to me anymore.</p>

        <p>You are here, sharing sanity with a hundred thousand plus people. Your family may not understand, but we do. I truly hope you do not follow through on that plan. It is your choice of course but you may meet lots of kind and aware people in the future, who you definitely will not be able to share support with if you are gone. I know I'm just someone on the internet but I'm sending you lots of positive thoughts and I hope you feel able to hang on. If for no other reason than to spite the authoritarian creeps that want us all dead. Maybe tomorrow you can find a way to brighten your day somehow- nature always helps, even a simple thing like looking at a tree for a while can lift the spirits. Or doing something you have loved in the past that you're still able to do. Draw? Dance? I don't know what it will be but I hope something will brighten your day and lift your spirits soon.</p>

        <p>the governments current "strategy" is that we need 80% vaccination rate.. which is fucking insane.</p>
<p>because :</p>
<p>a) they don't work</p>
<p>b) we are currently at like 10% vaccinated</p>
<p>c) they will always move the goal posts and change the parameters</p>
<p>d) there is no independent way to fact check there numbers, so we have to rely on a government to tell the truth, which will never happen</p>

<p>i worked out roughly they would have to do a PCR test every 1.1 Second to have these testing levels, and I'm not sure if you have ever met an Australian government worker, but they are always on go slow mode.</p>

        <p>To be honest, we haven't had guns for 15ish years, but even when we did have them, they were majority for farmers and hunting - not personal protection weapons. We were never a gun loving nation to start with, so I don't think there is much regret simply because it wasn't in our ethos to start with</p>

        <p>I don't want to hurt or kill anyone.</p>
<p>I also want to live my life as I see fit, based on my own reason and understanding.  Obviously "as I see fit" excludes harming or killing others.</p>
<p>I don't harm or kill others with da covid, because I don't have it.  So the exception above does not apply.</p>
<p>Police are free to inflict violence on us if we choose not to comply with arbitrary laws.  We are not free to inflict violence on the police if we disregard those arbitrary laws and they take exception to that.</p>
<p>And soldiers?  What are soldiers for but to kill?  It's what they're trained for.  Sure they have tear gas and rubber bullets, but at the end of the day, if those don't work, soldiers are going to be soldiers.  Otherwise the police could be used.</p>
<p>Should the police use excessive force, we have no recourse.  They shouldn't be out in the first place, but this is what we're facing.  If they hurt a protester, the media will slant it to portray the protester as violent even if they were just peacefully standing with a sign, shouting "Freedom!"  This is nothing new, look at the peace marches and civil rights protests of the 1960s.  But as long as most citizens go along with it, we have no way of stopping that violence.  Even when more people begin to wake up and notice this imbalance, the cops will continue. "Yeah so what?  What are ya gonna do about it? Do you want a baton to the head too?"</p>
<p>If we physically stop a police officer from harming one of us, we will be charged with assault-on-cop, which is a <em>far</em> more serious charge in the courts than assault on any other citizen.  If more police start getting seriously hurt or dead, the army comes out. And the same applies to them, they're allowed to hurt us and we cannot legally stop them.</p>
<p>One strategy which seems to work is non-violent protest. But many people have to suffer brutality before the tide of public opinion swings in their favor.  Now, with the extremely effective propaganda, protesters are already viewed with strong prejudice as murderous superspreaders,so it will take a lot to swing opinion.  But it is heartening to see how many people are out in the streets all over Europe.  The police are even joining the protests in some places.</p>
<p>So why is the Australian government so insane about this!?</p>

        <p>Why is aus government so insane? that's the billion dollar question.</p>
<p>In regards to protests and civil disobedience, there was a large protest a few weeks back in which the police where clearly embarrassed about in which they grossly under estimated the attendance and the passion that people would have, so there has been a two week media blitz publicly shaming attendees, as well as setting up a task force to track down anyone in attendance.</p>
<p>Even on the weekend just gone, the police did a show of force to "discourage" any further protests, buy locking down Sydney in a "ring of steel" 1000 police on land, water and air. they didn't allow any traffic/taxi's etc into city. pulled over 70k cars driving to interrogate them as why they are driving etc.</p>

        <p>&lt;jaw drop&rt;  Oh, man, that's crazy.</p>
<p>I feel like Australia is the "canary in the coal mine" for the rest of us.  Our governments are watching, to see if they pull it off. If so, we'll get the same treatment.</p>
<p>It's possible they're afraid of how many people in the US have guns, but... </p>
<p>&rt; a task force to track down anyone in attendance</p>
<p>...this is what they've done for the January 6 protesters at the US capitol.  Hundreds have been arrested.  With the media propaganda blitz, it seems like they're trying to criminalize conservative opinions - IMO, to politically and socially neuter those who might actually try to resist.</p>

        <p>Essentially yesterday they let some commercial construction open back up, but under very strict conditions etc. But in saying that if you are from one of the 8 LGA (local government areas) that they have declared a "hot spot" you cannot go work, south west and western sydney are declared hot spots and majority of trades and labour come from those areas. So essentially you can work, but also you cant..</p>

<p>It's getting pretty bad for you guys. Once the rules come in, it takes ages for them to reinstate your freedoms.</p>
<p>We have just over 100 active cases and masks are still mandatory inside and outside.</p>
<p>It's mental.</p>
<p>I hope you're doing ok, the worst part is, people actually celebrating that the government are doing the right thing.
We were on day 100 of our hard lockdown last year with '2 more weeks of zero cases until we let you out' and people on the Melbourne subreddit were calling for more.</p>

        <p>As a Melbournian, this post is filled with straight up lies.</p>
<p>Sydney is nowhere near its peak. It’s been steadily increasing and isn’t slowing.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is in its SECOND week of hard-ish lockdown - people are still gathering without masks and having cocktails on the beach.</p>
<p>Thirdly, plumbing, electrical etc IS considered essential work. Construction paused for roughly a week, but has resumed as of a few days ago.</p>
<p>Fourth, you actually CAN visit your intimate partner.</p>
<p>Fifth: retail is OPEN for click and collect, you just can’t browse in the store.</p>
<p>Sixth: international flights are still happening, just at a reduced capacity.</p>
<p>OP is full of shit, literally every point they’ve made is pure misinformation.</p>

        <p>I think it’s important to mention that vaccination rates in Australia are insanely low (only starting to pick up now) and even with the current cases we have, health services are incredibly swamped and struggling. It’s not comparable to most of the world with high vaccination rates. We don’t have this vaccine protection therefore if cases escalated deaths will be in the thousands. This is clearly the key factor in the lockdown, everywhere else in the world that was locked down returned to somewhat normal life after high vaccination compliance. </p>
<p>We are behind the rest of the world because we got comfortable and thought we were untouchable, therefore not prioritising vaccination.</p>
