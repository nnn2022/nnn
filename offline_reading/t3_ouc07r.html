    <strong>Life in the new normal is utter trash and is completely worthless and meaningless</strong>
    <p><p>I don't want to sound suicidal nor am I thinking about suicide. But I am going to be very honest with you.</p>
<p>I got vaxxed, hoping that this shitty way of living would go away. I thought that once the most people got vaccinated things would get better. I always knew a lot of people wouldn't get the jabs. My conclusion is that once vaccines were available then ok, people make their choice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately everything is turning out really bad. I just read that the CDC is going to make public the findings that vaxxed people are just as contagious as unvaxxed people regarding the Delta variant. Israel is experimenting with a third dose on people in a desperate move to avoid going to the measures that are making life completely useless. </p>
<p>It is going to be a matter of months, if not weeks, that the CDC announces the vaccines are ineffective against the Delta virus. If we already know they have "changed the science as according to new data" on masks, reverting from being not necessary to necessary you can be sure they will do the same with the vaccines. And when that happens, the considerations on curfews, lockdowns and severe restrictions are going to appear again. Perhaps if you are lucky to live in Florida or Texas you won't see much but blue states and Puerto Rico (where I live) as well as the rest of the world is going back to the nightmare and terror of the beginning, with the major difference that there is NO HOPE since vaccines had been proven to have failed.</p>
<p>Folks, this life of extremely inconvenient traveling, consistent testing not knowing what to expect and knowing that a positive is an automatic incarceration at home for 10-14 days, of intermittent lockdowns and curfews, and a devastated social life and depression levels at all time in history highs, is worthless. And governments do not seem they will hesitate to imposing draconian methods for DECADES to come.</p>
<p>I remember life before 2020 and I can swear to you there is nothing I would like more than going back to the past and relive my first 36 years and repeat once 2020 approaches, because life really stopped being worth enjoying when this nightmare started.</p></p>

        <p>I'm about the same age and feel the exact same way. The old life feels like a dream. It's shocking how much we have lost in such a short period of time. It is OK to grieve, it's OK to be scared. We are never ever going back to the way things were, but hopefully we can prevent the worst case scenarios from unfolding.</p>

        <p>please do not loose hope!! things will get better!! try to focus on the good. try to be more one with the earth. i know that it sounds corny but seriously. people have become so far detached from living they are missing out on the beautiful ness of life. the sun, the moon, the sky, nature, animals, family. the smallest thing to the biggest thing. enjoy life as much as you can. take up some new hobbies. find more like minded people. positive thoughts always. you'll be surprised how happy you'll become when you let go of the rest of it.</p>

        <p>Honestly just the whole economic atmosphere within the last 12 years makes me want to fucking kill myself. And knowing that I might be forced to have to take the vaccine in the future, I'll definitely kill myself if it comes down to that. Honestly this world has been super shitty for the last 15 years and it ain't going to get any better. I'm 35 and I haven't even finished College yet and I will be halfway through the best part of my life by the time I ever get my degree. I've never invested any of my money and if I don't kill myself I'll probably never be able to retire.</p>

        <p>Here is my theory. </p>
<p>The virus is real and has killed a lot of people. I know because I’ve seen it first hand in countless people. However, it’s not Ebola or the Black Plague. It’s still a virus with a &rt;99% survival rate. </p>
<p>Of course, the media drummed up hysteria and the NPC’s fell for it hook, line and sinker. </p>
<p>Our government rushed to the rescue with these so called “vaccines.” I think they want to force this “vaccine” on us so they can paint themselves as a hero who solved the Corona crisis. </p>
<p>The problem is they are so unbelievably corrupt and incompetent they fail to realize that these MRNA vaccines are going to cause a lot of fucking damage to a lot of people. </p>
<p>They can’t and will never admit that. So they will just cover it and force it down our throats.</p>

        <p>They literally announced Pfizer is 88% effective against delta and a third shot may help. Don't spread nonsense.</p>
<p>Edit for clarity:
The study: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259420v1.full.pdf</p>
<p>Vaccines also help with reducing hospitalizations and death. Virus mutation will continue to be a factor as viruses have less of a chance to mutate when inhibited, but yea let's give people a reason to stay unvaccinated so they can keep complaining about masks and quarantine.</p>

        <p>You should read how Pfizer did and did not count various statistics in their phase 3 trial.  Pretty shady and manipulative shit they pulled, as usual, and nobody's been talking about it.</p>
<p>People are too busy talking about the red herring talking points of "safe and effective" that the goose-steppers dictated for everybody to talk about.</p>
<p>Also, any such 39% is nonsense in addition to what you wrote, also because it's Relative Risk Reduction, which isn't really meaningful.  The Absolute Risk Reduction is something like 1.3% or whatever, because without their shit, the virus is already no big deal.</p>
<p>Man, we could go on and on about how it's all hogwash, and meanwhile the hogs are screaming to be washed :/</p>

        <p>Yup read about that. You had a severe reaction? Well you're unblinded and out of the trial,  only the healthiest people remain in their experiment cohort, naturally "increasing" efficacy rates. That's not how double blind is supposed to work lol.</p>
