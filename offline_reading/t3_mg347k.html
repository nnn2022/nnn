        <p>That's just one example I saved. I don't live in Croatia either. It happens everywhere. But anyway, as I said, over the year there have been too many inconsistencies, it really takes a fool not to see SOMETHING is wrong and start questioning.</p>

        <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I have to admit I've been a bit hostile toward anti-lockdown/mask/vaccine-adjacent types, especially with all the Qanon shit. But starting today I'm going to try and be objective as possible, so to finally make my mind up on all this. I don't know if I see my position changing much from where it is now, and I think the U.S. government's handling of the situation was quite abysmal (Especially with regard to the stimulus bills), but I'll keep an open mind :)</p>

        <p>Because if you die for any reason and test positive for Covid. They counted as a Covid death. Shoot your face off and test positive itâ€™s COVID. And then you have to keep in mind of ALL the false positives tests. </p>

        <p>The method by which they count a death as COVID does seem a little shady tbh. I don't entirely agree with the second doctor that was speaking though. While we shouldn't automatically assign COVID to anyone who had it prior to their death, It's important to take into account the effects which the virus can have on those with underlying conditions. My cousin for example passed away due to COVID, which he couldn't withstand due to a medication he took that weakened his immune system immensely.</p>

        <p>I think the main point from the second doctor as that theyâ€™re being pressured to write it on the death certificate....why because they get money. Always follow the money. And he is not the only doctor to come out and say this. They get zero dollars if someone dies from Flu. They get $13,000 for admitting someone with Covid and upwards of $30,000 if they go on a ventilator and so much if they die. Donâ€™t you think that explains why thereâ€™s no flu anywhere. Hospitals are a business they want to make money.</p>

        <p>I see your point, although I don't necessarily agree that the flu is entirely comparable in this regard. For one, they are not the same virus. Influenza has existed in a few strains for quite a long time, and still comes around each year during flu season. The worst example being the 1918 Spanish Flu Pandemic. When it gets bad, schools do sometimes close down for a few days. But that's beside the point, I'm rambling.</p>
<p>I'm also curious where exactly you got the numbers for how much doctors are paid to treat COVID patients. I wouldn't doubt it, but that obviously has to vary from country to country.  </p>
<p>But yeah, hospitals are businesses, just as prisons and many churches are. I would say the pandemic became serious enough to where hospitals saw the potential for money, and thus instituted ways a pressuring doctors to write COVID-19 as the cause of death for patients who may have died of a more complicated set of factors.</p>
<p>That being said, what are your thoughts on universal healthcare? Do you think it could ever help work against the corruption in hospitals in the U.S.?</p>

        <p>I believe those numbers came from Minnesota state senator Jensen who is also a doctor. 
Well medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the us. I canâ€™t imagine how much worse it would get if the government ran it. They canâ€™t even run the VA hospitals properly. I donâ€™t want the government anywhere near my health. Big Pharma basically owns the hospitals and medical school.  They pour billions of dollars into medical schools. Most Doctors get less than one year of nutrition training. Youâ€™re also talking to someone who had homebirths and uses Herbal medicine. I havent touched a pharmaceutical in over a year. No Advil no Tylenol nothing.</p>

        <p>UK government came out and admitted the numbers were exaggerated and overinflated. WHO said that the PCR testing people were doing had far too many cycles and got testers to reduce testing because of the astronomical numbers of false positives caused by this. Then there's the fact that literally anyone testing positive counts as a 'covid death', regardless of how they died; the only people I know who have been counted as 'covid deaths' did NOT die of covid.</p>
