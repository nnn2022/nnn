        <p>Kemp is jumping through all kinds of hoops, hoping that everyone forgets the role he played in the sham election. He probably made a deal with the people that organized the what went down in Georiga. If he went along with what they wanted him to do, as soon as it was done, he gets to do shit like this to get back in everyone's good graces.I am totally against forcing people to stay in their homes and wear masks but,  Kemp has ulterior motives. Anything he does at this point is for self preservation.</p>

        <p>I think, I hope, people in Georgia are able to see who Kemp is and what role he played in November. Not sure though. There have been far too many people who haven't been able to see what went down in the 2020 election. Which I don't understand, at all. No matter what side you might be on, how can you not see all the unexplainable and, almost, impossible  data the election produced? The census that just came out should raise questions. It shows the difference between the number of registered voters counted and the total number of votes cast in 2020 almost equals the amount of votes Biden won by. Something so simple should, at least, force people to question the results. It's very frustrating.</p>
