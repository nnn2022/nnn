    <strong>I’ve had the best day since a while</strong>
    <p><p>On Friday, I didn’t do anything particularly special. </p>
<p>At 7 I had work and finished at 1. After that I traveled to centre, went to art gallery for the celebration of day of dead. Later on I went to mall buy some boring wardrobe necessities  since I got paid, went to eat a dinner at a restaurant I wanted to try out since a while, visited my favourite book shop and chatted with sales assistant. Bought some pure oils and went back home at the evening, finished my school work and went to sleep. </p>
<p>And then Boris Johnson has announced the second lockdown. </p>
<p>I haven’t had such a good day since ages. Just note how basic and simple was what I did during that day. But it felt so good. I don’t have such days anymore and pre-covid I’d be going around, juggling between work and school every single day. Socialising on daily basis and yes, I was extremely tired many times because working and studying ain’t easy but in the end of the day I was doing SOMETHING. The work got to be always done! </p>
<p>It was such a good day but who knew it’d be the last before all those simple stuff are being “illegal” once again. Fuck the government.</p></p>

        <p>Those “scientist” who appear in headliners on bbc etc. Are paid government puppets. Note how it’s only the same names appearing and how many unions of doctors start being created who criticise everything whats going on. I know cases of doctors who lost the right to do their job because they publicly spoken how fake everything is. Quite weird to have so many contrasting opinions about something what’s supposed to be purely scientific isn’t it?</p>

        <p>Yup, every “expert” that dares call out the bullshit is called a “far right psuedoscientist” and people eat it up. Terrible world.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. I understand how the whole thing is political at this point but I don’t understand what the side of the wing have to do with this. But it does make sense, most leftist are extremely oversensitive and easiest group to manipulate. I’m centrist so it’s not biased, both groups have pros and cons but left def is the biggest reason for allowing this to happen</p>

        <p>Yea the main issue is that at least here in the US, the leftist have gone so far off the cliff I’ve seen some claim that liberals are “far right”. I would be considered literal hitler even tho im center right. It’s ridiculous...</p>

        <p>Yeah same here! It’s so hard to classify myself in any wing but this whole corona-paranoia always pushes me far away from left cause this is the tendency I noticed.</p>
