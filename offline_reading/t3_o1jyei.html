        <p>They pushed the vaccine way too hard for my liking. Thank god they did too because if they were more subtle about it i might have taken it without thinking.</p>

        <p>Same.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, I just sat back and watched. Did my own risk assessment and determined I wasn't concerned with COVID, figured it would sweep the country, we'll all get it. </p>
<p>I was looking forward to the vaccines. But my position was still sitback and wait.</p>
<p>Then came the vaccine. It seemed like all logic went out the window. The push to get everyone vaccinated was irrational. There was more chaos, flip-flopping, gaslighting during the vaccine push than during COVID. </p>
<p>You kept hearing about "science", but there was none. Just statistics. Then the propaganda. The "just get the jab", "it's safe". </p>
<p>When all of that started happening, I changed my position.</p>

        <p>I am a recovered doomer—in the beginning of the pandemic, through last June or so, I believed COVID was extremely deadly and would kill millions.</p>
<p>I changed my mind when I realized millions weren’t dying, learned about the studies that showed that masks don’t actually work, and found out that the media was actually making COVID out to be much worse than it actually was in order to (so I thought at the time) sway the election.</p>
<p>I have since learned, of course, that the election wasn’t the point, or at least not the main point, but that was my reasoning at the time.</p>

        <p>None.  No unvaccinated person has ever been found to have had covid.  Ever.  The PCR test only checks for parts of things, cannot and does not test for a virus or infection.  They are all false positives.  The death rate is essentially the same as it was the prior year.  Complete hoax.</p>

        <p>While I agree with what your saying. Most people cannot accept that they have been lied to that fucking hard. at least not in one step.</p>
<p>We need to use their bullshit tainted data to show them how fucking wrong they are. Then once they realize the fear and lockdowns were all deception its easier to sell the whole covid probably doesn't really exist and its just all the regular colds and flus and maybe they released some actual sars or mers to explain the more serious cases.</p>

        <p>Well according to their numbers, from Oct, and subtracting 25% per the CDC...  "covid" killed ~750/month in 2020.   If you're less than 70 you have a higher chance to die from falling off a ladder.</p>
<p>That's with the entire world exposed.  Based on the relatively small amount people vaccinated, the death rate for the vax is going to exceed that of the "covid".  That's not to mention all the terrible side effects:(</p>

        <p>At the beginning, when the media was prancing about laughing about how it couldn't possibly esmxist, because Trump brought it up, I thought there might be something to it. Once the security theater started, though, I stopped being a doomer.</p>

        <p>Yes. I started switching after someone told me that flu cases basically disappeared.</p>
<p>I checked the data, was surprised as fuck, then started to do more research and noticed is all a scam. It was like around September 2020.</p>

        <p>I was formerly the first one of my crew/family to adopt masks and spread the doom “Covid is coming to kill us all!” type stuff. Was originally onboard to get the vaccine etc. However, one day I drove by a J&amp;J clinic they were having in town and it looked so eerie and abnormal and quite honestly scared the shit out of me worse than Covid ever did. I stopped watching the news on TV after that and started digging into Internet searches on the vaccines and history and was shocked that what I was hearing wasn’t aligning with what I was hearing on tv and FB etc. Some of my family is in healthcare and they had refused the vaccines when offered in the first wave which I couldn’t previously understand. One day I came to them and said “ok guys this takes a lot of humility but I was wrong about a lot of stuff.” Most of my friends are “liberals” and they assume I’m vaccinated. The ones that know I’m not are shocked (since I was the biggest and original doomer in our circle). They listened to my reasons for not taking the “jab” respectfully and a couple have even said things like “shit,  I didn’t know all of that.” But yeah. I had no idea I was being brainwashed until I turned off the news. Definitely an eye opening experience and huge change for me the past six months.</p>
