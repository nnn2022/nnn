    <strong>Interesting Canadian tire experience</strong>
    <p><p>Me and my mom went into canadian tire because we needed to get some cat food. We dont wear masks because they cause is to get claustrophobic if and have panic attacks. We only needed to be in there for about 5-10 minutes, so we didnt think there would be any trouble. They were pretty heavy bags, so me and my mom each took one. We walked over to the register and there was a middle aged man in front of us (wearing a mask, obviously). We kept at least six feet away but my weak noodle arms couldn't hold the bag any longer so we put the bags on the checkout counter. The man in front of us kept looking back like he was going to say something. He finally turned around and said, " Hey! You know you're supposed to be standing on the dots on the floor, right?" And he motioned to the dots on the floor that we were one step in front of so we could reach the checkout counter. The dots were definitely more than six feet apart so we just ignored it (me and my mom both try to avoid conflict). He then continued hurling insults at us- that we ignored- until he finally yelled at us, "well, I hope you get it! I hope you and your whole family get and die!" My mom couldn't take it anymore so she just looked at him calmly and replied," Thank you. Your such a nice person for wishing death upon me and my family." He then mumbled "idiots" to himself and stormed out of the store. The cashier girl thanked us for not escalating the situation. We've never had issues with rude employees at canadian tire. It's always the customers. I dont know why people think that it makes them such great people to wish death upon others. Just thought I would it with y'all.</p>
<p>Short version:
Rude customer at canadian tire wished death upon my family and me. We dont wear masks because they cause us to have claustrophobia and panic attacks.</p></p>

        <p>Thankfully most people who can't mind their business and try and tell me to wear a mask are the same looking hipsters. Whenever someone asks me to put my mask on I just tell them to make me. None of these pro mask people will physically do anything, as they are weak irl and only strong on reddit. I am Canadian and haven't worn a mask in a year.</p>

<p>Raise above the situation, you need allies, not enemies to turn this shit around.</p>
