    <strong>Covid Workplace Bingo AKA "How may employees will I have at work today?</strong>
    <p><p>Is anyone else's workplace a fucking day to day gong-show because of stupid, constantly changing covid testing/self-isolation policies?</p>
<p>I manage 30 people. There are a multitude of tasks every day to complete; some are planned. Some are on very short notice. Some are generalist and can be assigned to anyone, some are extremely specialized and only one or two guys can deal with them.</p>
<p>Higher management insists "We've brought in the appropriate safety/protective mechanisms (AKA health-security theatre), so we are back to normal operations".</p>
<p>Reality is somewhat different.</p>
<p>Every day, it seems the policies regarding exposure to CCPvirus, testing, self-isolation, and sick time change.</p>
<p>It's doing two things - it's frustrating the hard workers who have to try to carry on with their jobs under the weight of this bullshit, and it's being taken full advantage of by the lazy.</p>
<p><em>"My kid has the sniffles. I have the sniffles. I gotta go get tested or I might kill Grandma!"</em> I know it's either a fucking lie, or a cold. But I can do nothing. Off he goes, out until his (negative) test comes back, on full pay. Conveniently, this seems to happen on Monday or Friday. Multiple times.</p>
<p><em>"I legit have a cold, but the manager above you says I gotta get tested. I wanna stay at work, but if I do, I will get in shit."</em> I confirm the story, and it's true. Thanks, Karen! That "no fail" task that needed to be done today isn't getting done. And it will be me getting raked over the coals for it, not you.</p>
<p><em>"I'm sick. I had to go get tested. And now my two room mates have to stay home until my test results come back."</em> Awesome. I'm down three people for the next week for the price of one...</p>
<p>Manager: <em>"No. We can't have a BBQ and beer next Friday. That would be against social distancing rules."</em></p>
<p>Same Manager: <em>"Please have all of your guys in this room seated for 2pm for a presentation and briefing."</em> Huh? What about social distancing, Karen???</p>
<p>Fuck, I'm sick of these stupid games over this overblown virus. I want to burn the place down. With my Karen boss inside.</p></p>

        <p>Does sound like a pain from management perspective but to be fair if someone’s feeling ill that’s not their problem that they’re not at work, sounds more like a company problem.</p>
<p>I’m sure the sniffles people are just taking the piss but if someone genuinely feels ill then they should stay at home.</p>
<p>I’ve said this from the start. If you feel ill, stay at home. It’s common sense.</p>

        <p>I can't even bring my kid to school or summer daycare because of a huge list of symptoms. I know employees are taking advantage, but I have to take off a day or two any time my kid has a symptom. Thankfully this has only happened twice. I work in an office of about 10 now and only one employee keeps "getting sick" every other week.</p>
