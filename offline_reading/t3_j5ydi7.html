        <p>Lol that’s one thing my (physician) dad taught me when I was 6 is that everybody dies of something. No one actually dies of old age. Apparently this concept is difficult for people to understand. </p>
<p>Attributing a cause of death makes people uncomfortable, I think, because it makes it seem like their life could have been saved. Unfortunately that’s not how it works and everybody dies eventually.</p>

        <p>What's so strange is that most of those who died of covid were already above life expectancy. What would have been an achievement even a few decades ago - living into your 80s before succumbing to flu - is now treated as a terrible catastrophe to shut the world down for.</p>
<p>This might sound callous but we will all die of something eventually. So people of all ages should try and live their best lives now.</p>

        <p>&rt;  US response to COVID has been an abject failure.</p>
<p>I think pretty much everyone here agrees with that assessment. The US, on the whole, adopted fantastically-expensive "mitigation" measures in the form of lockdowns, school closures, mask mandates, etc. that did very little to reduce the (thankfully relatively modest) disease burden of this virus, but that have themselves done a truly <em>mind-boggling</em> amount of damage: damage to social trust and community, damage to people's financial security, damage to their mental and physical health, damage to our most fundamental liberties, and damage to the quality and enjoyment of hundreds of millions of people’s personal, professional, social, and educational lives. Furthermore, the premature deaths / life years lost due to the countless second-order effects of our response, including increased poverty, joblessness, depression, stress, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide, delayed medical diagnoses and treatments, etc., will dwarf, not just whatever marginal benefits we might imagine our hysterical response to this virus provided (the relevant comparison), but indeed, the entire disease burden of the virus itself.</p>

        <p>Your dad was right about 99.9% of cases, but my great grandmother <em>definitely</em> died of old age. She lived to be 104, and during the last 4 months of her life her brain just started shutting itself down. Then one night she went to sleep and never woke up.</p>

        <p>Then it sounds like she died of some kind of brain deterioration. At 104, we just chalk that up to old age rather than spend time and resources on figuring out an exact cause. Shit gets old and fails much more easily, but something causes that failure. When just about anything could be the cause and there is an extremely low likelihood of cure and recovery, we don't bother. It sucks, but it is what it is.</p>

        <p>Indeed. Though I think the point is that we don't just reach a certain age and <em>POOF!</em> Rather, our bodies naturally deteriorate as we age, finding it more and more difficult to recover from whatever illness or injury, ultimately making us more susceptible to what would be a minor bug when we were younger. Such as the flu, or the rona, or whatever glitch in your grandma's brain ultimately took her. Those who say age is "just a number" or "all in your head" are a bit delusional, but it sure as hell isn't the number itself that kills us.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with any of that. I'm just saying that she didn't die of any contagion, or cancer, or acute failure of a vital organ. She got so old that her body deteriorated to a point where it was no longer able to maintain homeostasis. That's a death from old age.</p>

        <p>Something failed. One of her vital organs stopped working for some reason and everything else followed.</p>
<p>At that age, it could be as simple as your lungs being too weak to draw in enough air. It would technically be apnea, but at that age we call it "dying of old age". </p>
<p>The body does not just die for literally no reason, but it does eventually reach a point where it is so weak that just about any reason under the sun is enough to do it. After that age, we just don't spend a lot of effort on finding the cause. We chalk it up to old age.</p>

        <p>If she died in her sleep and she was elderly, the most likely cause is underlying heart failure which puts you at risk for cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Another possibility is massive PE or MI. Another possibility is a massive stroke. </p>
<p>Trust me there is always a cause we just can’t do an autopsy on everyone who dies.</p>

        <p>Right, but isn’t the number of excess deaths since March over 200,000? As in, year by year, from March to October, the average total number of deaths is 200k lower than this year. How exactly would you justify that?</p>

        <p>First they murdered people of all ages in localized hell-holes like NYC and Lombardy Italy with ventilators, do not resuscitate orders, and neglect while they recategorized flu/pneumonia deaths as cov-aides to goose the CNN Death-o-meter.</p>
<p>Then when they ran out of enough people to kill and deaths to re-categorize, they all of a sudden absurdly started counting and chanting the symptom-less "cases!, cases!".</p>
<p>Of course these lies are never acknowledged on TV. But its disturbing that the Trump/Atlas and allied opposition, rather than pointing directly to the lies, ignore the lies and is offering this new compromise face-saving "out" for them with this "it only endangers really old people significantly, so let's just lock down old people".  Yes, it may be true--given cooked or even honest numbers--but it makes no sense to make this argument, thinking they'll go for it because maybe it allows them to somewhat save face and not have be held accountable for their murderous destruction. </p>
<p>Most importantly, no one asks the question, how does "it" endanger old people any more severely than flu/pneumonia endangered old people last year, the year before, 1969, 1958, etc?</p>
<p>This question is never asked, just like the analogous question was and still is NEVER asked or contemplated: How does "it" endanger young people any more severely than flu/pneumonia/viral respiratory diseases did last year, the year before, 1969, 1958, etc.</p>
<p>Monumental hoaxes such as this are never acknowledged and nobody is ever held accountable.  Many years later when a hoax becomes unsustainable like the Iraq War hoax, they might slow down and then just stop talking about it on TV, or even admit quietly that some "mistakes" were made, but the all important objective is that they must SAVE FACE.</p>

        <p>More than 200,000 EXTRA deaths have occurred since March. The number of Covid deaths can’t be explained away as “reclassified flu” when more people died this year than in previous years.</p>
