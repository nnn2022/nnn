    <strong>Why -I think- lockdowns aren't surprising</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, I am not saying I support them - I just understand why do they happen.</p>
<p>Here's my reasoning.</p>
<p>One, we all agree that no one knows enough about the virus to make any sort of solid predictions. What we do have, is situations in other countries. Why is Italy consistently used as an exaple, rather than eg. Sweden? Because Italy was worst-case scenario, simple.</p>
<p>Two, I hope we all agree that public healthcare system in nearly any country, simply doesn't have enough resources to treat everyone who get anything above mild symptoms. Its not just equipment - its mainly staff. In addition, <em>main</em> problem is that all is fine and dandy if you get no symptoms... however, if you <em>do</em>, unless you stick to your principles, you <em>WILL</em> rush to the hospital for the ventilator and care, and be all like "Oh I didn't know".</p>
<p>If we agree on this baseline, then the reasoning for lockdown is natural - government has to do <em>something</em> to appear like they have an idea, because, what is the alternative?
They make public statement like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Our healthcare system will, of course, protect everyone - but if resources are strained, we will take care of the young first" (triage has already happened)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We aren't gonna lock down, so folks who have potential to develop serious complications will have to stay home and take ALL precautions while the youngs go out and party."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"If it so happens that you paid ALL attention you can - and because we don't understand the virus yet, you STILL get infected - you end up in a hospital, you will have to compete for limited attention and equipment with young people who have paid no attention at all and engaged in 'risky' behaviour - sorry mate, sucks ass, but yer gonna die."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottomline, for government - its either lockdowns, simply to create appearance as if they're doing something, or its publicly stating that there's really nothing they can do because the systems we use, that we all pay money for - simply aren't designed to help the amount of people that might need help.</p>
<p>"Sorry peeps, but your taxes just aren't high enough to pay for medical system that can support this sort of stuff, so some of you are just going to have to die."</p>
<p>If I'd be &rt;70y, and been paying the amount in taxes I'm paying for this useless public healthcare system, and then told that I just have to die because I should've instead invested into private care - I'd be pretty damn pissed off, NOT to mention that it'd be a great sign to all the young people who are about to become voters, to say <em>NO</em> to the public healthcare.</p>
<p>IMO - there's nothing else government <em>can</em> do, except lockdowns.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;One, we all agree that no one knows enough about the virus to make any sort of solid predictions</p>
<p>No, we do not all agree with this. The morbidity and mortality associated with the virus is extremely heavily stratified by age and co-morbidities. We can make many solid predictions and have been able to make them for over a year. </p>
<p>&rt;Two, I hope we all agree that public healthcare system in nearly any country, simply doesn't have enough resources to treat everyone who get anything above mild symptoms. </p>
<p>Dubious. Human ingenuity is basically infinite and capable of solving most problems people declare imposible to solve. Also with the possible brief exception of nyc, hospitals were not overwhelmed anywhere and most were housing a markedly lower number of patients than was typical compared to historical 
trends</p>

<p>Something like 96% of people put onto a vent expired</p>

<p>Yes, this is how humanity has dealt with viral pestilence for our history. You are aware the entire concept of lockdowns to mitigate the severity of a viral pandemic was concocted in 2006 as a result of a computer model devised by a high school girl, right?</p>
<p>Stop apologizing for lockdowns—this is what you are doing even though you claim not to be in favor of them lamely at the beginning. Lockdowns are indefensible. The crippling psychological damage and resulting deaths of despair, the strangulation of supply chains and resulting spike in global poverty, and the extirpation of people’s lives’ work associated witj lockdowns all KILL.</p>

        <p>I don't think there's need for pointy replies like this. We are on the same side.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't "defend lockdowns" or "lamely claim I'm not in favor of them". I act the way I want to act - you're literally no one to me, that I have to prove to you the "strenght of my believes and values". I posted my opinion - it wasn't sharpened at anyone, it was merely one of the possible explanations about why governments make decisions as they do.</p>
<p>Second, "stop apologizing for lockdowns" - to begin with, I am not apologizing for anything - I am explaining, but I guess nuance is too fine for you to grasp.</p>
<p>To end - you are, again, literally no one to tell me what I can or cannot do, lol! Interpret whatever I wrote however you wish - you're, of course, free to do that, but if you want me (or anyone else) to take your opinion seriously and take up a discussion - then you can't go around telling people what are they "actually" doing or feeling or thinking. </p>
<p>I'll act the way I want to - if I fell like I want to "apologize for lockdowns", I'll go do that (at appropriate subs, probably not here), and if I feel I want to rant against them (as I did), I will do that.</p>
<p>For the rest:
&rt;No we do not all agree...</p>
<p>This is what I was hoping to get from this discussion. "Extremely heavily" sounds stupid. I read a post from someone few days ago, actually citing papers, so I agree on this. Its not a subject of discussion tho - I also think its silly to think governments will follow science. They follow what causes re-elections.</p>
<p>&rt; Dubious...</p>
<p>Appeal to human ingenuity is a logical fallacy. For the hospitals - my mom and her husband live in Italy, and have been there when the chaos started there, so you can cuddle yourself into your opinions, but it is a fact that Italian hospitals were overwhelmed and they did triage - basically, prioritized whose lives to save. GRANTED - many of these people died from not-Covid, but they'd probably survive (god knows for how long or how short) if the equipment and personell wasn't called to treat covid patients with severe symptoms.
In addition, both my best friend <em>and</em> my sister live in Sweden. My sister just so happens to be a nurse, so I have first-hand insight into how is Sweden doing (pretty darn well, but this isn't surprising given that they pay a hefty tax for public healthcare).</p>
<p>&rt; Something like 96%...</p>
<p>I believe you made this statistic up, on the spot. Maybe you haven't, in which case I apologize.</p>
<p>&rt; You are aware...</p>
<p>I work with machine learning for living. I'd say, yes, I understand how models work, and how severely flawed Covid models were. I also think its quite dumb to believe any government ever actually followed science, especially since science is very inconcrete on the subject. I also think you're unqualified to discuss this at all, so don't use it in arguments as a bluff.</p>

        <p>I think this is the utopistic argument.</p>
<p>People who form the government are primarily looking after themselves and their own families, first and foremost - like everyone else is. Since politics are their career - they are not making decisions that are morally correct, but decisions that have highest possibility to get them re-elected.</p>
<p>While governments <em>should</em> act in benefit of the people that have elected them - the way modern centralized governments work, simply doesn't evolve that way.</p>

        <p>No it's not. Not utopian at all. What is utopian is bootlickers and statists think government had to do something. They didn't because the data never justified thier actions.</p>

        <p>We understand the virus just fine, and there is a much better approach approved by many experts world wide. It's detailed in the greater Barrington declaration.</p>
<p>My personal take on it. We never should of locked down, fixed masks, vaccines etc... </p>
<p>We could of simply had a very low death rate due to:
* Prompt use of cheap and readily available theraputics such as ivermectin OR hydroxy with zinc supplementation.
* encouraged people to take their vitamins, especially C and D. (And eat healthily)
* Encouraged people to get outdoors and exercise.
* Offered targeted protection for vulnerable groups, PPE, priority on home delivery, support care.</p>
<p>Boom, there you have it, a miniscule death rate, no lockdowns, no shitty mRNA vaccines, no crippling debt, social distancing, undue pressure on healthcare etc..</p>
<p>It's a virus, with a massively overstated risk. The solutions are simple and effective - just not as profitable or helpful to zee agenda.</p>

        <p>No we don’t all agree with your statement that we don’t know enough yet about the virus, it’s been a year and it has a 99.7 percent survival and it’s probably more like 99.99 percent when you factor in how many false positives and the incentives the hospitals were getting 40k for calling it a Covid death.  </p>
<p>And no we don’t agree on public healthcare being overrun that’s complete bullshit and the media has been caught setting up fake scenes of busy hospitals.  </p>
<p>The ventilators were meant to kill people 90% who were put on them died, your not supposed to intimate these people.</p>

        <p>The part about not knowing enough about the virus, okay, I was wrong. I believed this is the norm.</p>
<p>The part about public healthcare being overrun - trust me or not, but you're wrong. My family lives in Italy, and my sister (who is a nurse), lives in Sweden. I've gotten first-hand accounts from both countries, and Italy  <em>did</em> triage (ie. prioritized equipment and patients). Its a fact.</p>
<p>Sweden, where people pay hefty taxes for public healthcare, was setting up field hospitals (that later, due to bureaocratic error, ended up unused, but that's another story).</p>

        <p>Or.. this is a compliance test. New Zealanders broke like cheap crackers. Like they did on guns and now today on tobacco. So they test tiny nations. Islands preferred. Then it moved to Italy and Greece. Then it went to western nations. Nordic nations pushed back on the “science”. Germany and France sucked its cock. Some american governors did and others didn’t. Also follow the transfer of wealth. 37% of ALL money printed by the USA .. happened in the past 12 months. Where is that money?</p>

        <p>This information about the end goal is not hard to find. People, especially in Canada, are talkinng about this. Our Prime Minister is in full support . WEF talks a LOT about their vision of the future.</p>

        <p>Okay, but I don't know where to start? I searched for "wef vision of the future" and found this:</p>
<p>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/future-predictions-what-if-get-things-right-visions-for-2030/</p>
<p>I read just the paragraph titles, and while some sound just like popular narratives, none seem horrific to me?</p>
<p>Clean air? Cities where you can walk anywhere? Democratic gig economy? Oh lord, the horror.</p>

        <p>Well, I am not trolling you! I do want to read about this.</p>
<p>All this time to write you don't have time to do easy research for me, you could've instead spend just telling me which search phrases to look for, but you're too busy telling me how I'm too dumb to do an 'easy' research myself.</p>
