        <p>But this bit needs to be spread far and wide, proof that natural infection is far more protective against variants than the so-called vaccine:</p>
<p>&rt; They note that in COVID-19 survivors, the immune system's antibodies evolve during the first year, becoming more potent and better able to resist new variants. In 32 volunteers who never had COVID-19, they found that antibodies induced by mRNA vaccines did evolve between the first and second shots. But five months later, vaccine-induced antibodies were "equivalent" to those seen after the second dose, with "little measurable improvement" in the antibodies' ability to neutralize a broad variety of new variants,</p>

        <p>Something many people don't want to admit because this has turned into a cult...the goal post has been moved! You can tell from the whitewashing so many people are doing about the vaccine and how it was never expected to stop the spread....but the CDC issued guidance to stop wearing masks.</p>
<h1>They are all back peddling on the initial objective - now the only objective was to stop people from getting hospitalized or dead.</h1>
<p>Funny how that works when you fail at your job. The fact that the vaccinated are turning on the unvaxed instead of the leadership that told them this is gross but they will unfortunately find out the hard way that they were lied to. They were made to believe they were being led by a talented leadership full of confidence - the reality? We are being led by a bunch of bafoons who can't find their way out of a dark room.</p>
<p>Any rational person should know that removing the mask mandate was them shooting themselves in the foot. Regardless how you feel about the mask mandate - the fact that it's back shows that they have failed at their jobs. The only metric of success was to keep the masks around...but then nobody would get vaccinated. And if nobody would get vaccinated how is Biden supposed to collect his price of 70%?</p>
<h1>That 70% goal post is also being moved coincidentally! Instead of tracking people who are FULLY vaccinated - they now consider 1 shot enough for that 70%!</h1>
<p>But were the problem right guys? Were the problem for not trusting our stupid federal leadership. My god this is so frustrating.</p>
