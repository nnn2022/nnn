        <p>SS: Emailed my MP before Christmas regarding the Coronavirus Act. They parroted a barely-relevant speech from Boris, so I sent them a series of questions to get them to explain their position which has been ignored. I have since thought of more questions which will be on their way, but the first 20 questions came from a post I had seen in this subreddit before, and I also added a few of my own as seen below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels flat or dropping across all age groups since May if the pandemic is still going?</li>
<li>What percentage of the population is assumed to have had prior immunity. to SARS-CoV-2 in the SAGE forecasting models?</li>
<li>Why do 50% of household members <em>not</em> catch SARS-CoV-2 from infected persons with whom they live?</li>
<li>Why have Japan and South Korea not had a serious outbreak if the human species has no prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2?</li>
<li>What percentage or the population or the UK is assumed to be immune to COVID-19 (<em>including prior immunity</em>) as or this date?</li>
<li>What percentage or those diagnosed with COVID-19 since July have developed antibodies to COVID-19, confirming the diagnosis?</li>
<li>If 90%. (SAGE Minutes: 21/09/2C) of the population is still susceptible to  SARS-CoV-2, why did the virus case numbers and deaths not double every  3-4 days throughout June, July and August, and indeed throughout the  Autumn?</li>
<li>Why have positive test results rocketed while numbers or symptomatic  patients in the community and NHS triage data show they have flatlined  since mid-September?</li>
<li>Why are acute respiratory admissions through Accident 8 Emergency  significantly below the normal for the time of year if the pandemic is  still raging?</li>
<li>Why are total hospital admissions, ICU/ITU occupancy and hospital oxygen  consumption at or below normal levels for the time of year?</li>
<li>What percentage of deaths labelled as being due to COVID-19 have had the diagnosis confirmed at post-mortem since July?</li>
<li>Why are the regions of the country that have had excess deaths not the same  regions that have supposed COVID-19 deaths, unlike in spring?</li>
<li>Why has Liverpool testing by the Army, failed to find COVID-19 in the  community when they are supposedly at the centre of the alleged "second  wave"?</li>
<li>How is a 0.22% rate of diagnosed infection in the public in Liverpool to be  reconciled with the ONS prediction of 2.3% infection rates in Liverpool  on 11th November based on PCR testing?</li>
<li>Why are much quicker lateral flow tests not being prioritised for hospital  admissions to prevent the standard 24-48 hour delay with PCR results and ensure that those who are positive can be isolated to prevent hospital  spread?</li>
<li>Why aren't all staff being tested by the lateral flow test to prevent the  staffing crisis being caused by false positive PCR results?</li>
<li>Do positive PCR tests for asymptomatic and symptomatic NHS staff, or anyone else, which result in them being required to self-isolate have  confirmatory re-tests performed?</li>
<li>Why is the country in lockdown when there are no excess hospital admissions, no excess intensive care bed use and no excess death rates  (by date of occurrence) in the midst of an allegedly out of control, raging pandemic?</li>
<li>Why are we in lockdown when the Government's own Operation Cygnus pandemic plan stated that lockdown could <em>only delay</em> deaths by a few weeks at most?</li>
<li>What evidence is there that lockdown has prevented more deaths than it has caused?</li>
<li>If there were financial links between the government scientific advisory  team and a foreign company that has heavily invested in the upcoming vaccine(s), would you agree or disagree that this may suggest a conflict of interest in creating the health and social policies that have led to the current circumstances?</li>
<li>If there were financial and career links between the Secretary of State  for Health and Social Care and the author of both "The Fourth Industrial  Revolution" and "The Great Reset", a proposed transfer of wealth and  power upwards from the public to governments and corporations in  response to a pandemic, would you agree or disagree that this may  suggest a conflict of interest in creating the health and social policies that have led to the current circumstances?</li>
<li>Are you aware of The Fourth Industrial Revolution and The Great Reset? If  not, please look into them. But don't look at mainstream media gaslighting. Go straight to the WEF.</li>
<li>Would you agree or disagree that coercing the public through job insecurity  and venue restrictions into taking an untested, first of its kind, essentially experimental vaccine does not outweigh the risks of the virus?</li>
<li>Would you agree or disagree that the use of the aforementioned social and financial  coercion is highly unethical in persuading people to permit the injection of an experimental medication?</li>
<li>Would you agree or disagree that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care awarding a government contract for medical supplies to a friend with no relevant experience may suggest a conflict of interest in the allocation of taxpayer's money in the response?</li>
