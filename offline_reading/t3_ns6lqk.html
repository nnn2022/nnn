    <strong>My wife's co-worker was hospitalized with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis after getting the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>After getting a COVID-19 vaccine (don't know which one, sorry), my wife's co-worker suddenly couldn't grip anything and was weak all over. She went to the hospital and it only got worse. The doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong at first. Eventually she lost the ability to walk. She has no memory of the first week that she was hospitalized. </p>
<p>Turns out she developed lesions on her spine and brain and the doctors concluded that she had acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. It's extremely rare in adults, but can be caused by an immune response to a vaccine ( <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24718826/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24718826/</a> ). The doctors never said it was definitely caused by the vaccine, but since it happened right after taking it, Occam's Razor says that the vaccine caused the reaction. </p>
<p>She's getting better now, but she needs to re-learn how to walk. Just thought I'd share the story to show that there is always a risk associated with any vaccine. Yes, this actually happened. No, I'm not making it up.</p></p>

        <p>I'm hearing this second hand from my wife. I'm sure the doctors in the hospital are well aware of all the details. I have no idea if this has been reported as a vaccine side effect anywhere though.</p>

        <p>Doctors never report it. Too much paperwork.</p>

        <p>You should report it. The vast majority of side effects are never reported, which lets them continue the "vaccines good and safe" narrative.</p>
