    <strong>Abusive lockdowns = more useful idiots lining up for the "vaccine"?</strong>
    <p><p>I would be interested to see if there is a correlation between the more abusive lockdowns and vaccination rates or the places that used common sense strategies instead of lockdowns and how that coincides with vaccination rates</p></p>

        <p>I would think "yes".
Because they actually believe everything will go back to normal if they vaccinate.</p>
<p>Same as they believed " Only two more weeks to flatten the curve" back in April last year. Months before any vaccine was official. (So nobody can blame "anti-vacc" for the extended two weeks)</p>

        <p>Easy yes, but i their defense.
EVERY msm news outlet. Everyone social media outlet. Govs and others have combined efforts to scare the crap of people.</p>
<p>Even I was worried a bit back in Jan-Feb 2020.</p>

        <p>I have zero sympathy for those pieces of trash. Those brainwashed idiots are why we are still in this mess. Plenty of people tried to warn them and point out the conflicts of interest but they just mocked us instead of looking into it further themselves.</p>

        <p>I have no sympathy what so ever with them either.
Neither with the hypochondriacs whining they have "long haul Covid" either.</p>
<p>And at work, 50% of the hypochondriacs have stayed home Teleworking since May last year. In fear of Covid, and most of them have came in twice for the magic potion. And they still stay home Teleworking out of "fear". 
"Then why take that shot of you don't trust it?" I ask myself.</p>
<p>They have just grown to love staying home. Getting sympathy from colleagues and Management.</p>

        <p>Yes. This is why every country reimposed the lockdowns for a "second wave" that happened to hit their countries exactly a month or two before they opened up the vax to most ages.</p>

        <p>Definitely. This has been the carrot. Literally everyone I know who got the vaccine wasn’t scared of COVID-19, they just “want us to go back to normal”. </p>
<p>I’m introverted though, and I work in IT so I’m “essential”. Essential, but work was finally forced to accept that I can do my entire job (almost) from my home office, which is only like 1000x better than getting up early, putting on uncomfortable clothing, fighting traffic, and stuffing myself into a can of sardines with a bunch of other annoying people who I don’t like. </p>
<p>Lockdowns? Bring ‘em on. I might continue to refuse the vaccine just to keep them going (kidding).</p>

        <p>I'd say this is true, because the US had the least abusive lockdowns in the Western world, except for probably Sweden, and many Americans have refused the jab. Fewer Americans than Canadians, anyhow. I don't have any idea how many people have had the shot in Sweden. In Australia, they've had abusive lockdowns and a low jab uptake, but I think that's because they're offering only Astra Zeneca, and people are well aware of the problems with that one (not that the others are problem-free).</p>
