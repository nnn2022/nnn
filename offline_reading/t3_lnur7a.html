<p>The process of impeachment is now moving forward as lawmakers evaluate all the evidence against Andrew Cuomo and his lack of responsibilities. Citizens of America (particularly the ones getting online here) know well that his actions led to the increased death of nursing home patients for almost a year now, and he had paid to have the numbers on death changed. Of course NY citizens have been crying for help for months, but what do residents of their own city know? To add more fuel to the fire however, and push for more allegations against this man, I dug up this article from way back in April.</p>

<p>The USNS Comfort is an emergency medical ship staffed with 1,200 military trained doctors and nurses and 1,000 beds for patient capacity. According to this article, not even 200 patients were admitted into the ship during its 3 week long stay at the manhattan pier. Here’s another perspective on the situation for validation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html</a></p>

<p>It is reported that the ship staff and administration was required to overcome dozens upon dozens of military protocols and stipulations before even being considered to aid in the crisis. It seems to be a rather immoral stance to take when faced with the outbreak of this pandemic, but there was just one snag that dragged the whole thing down in the first place.</p>
<p>This was Trump’s idea.</p>
<p>I don’t even support Trump, but that shouldn’t even matter. I see corruption, I see deceit, I’m certainly going to immediately point it out. So when Cuomo is charged for his neglect of the populace for his own political gain, you better believe I want this event to take stage soon enough.</p></p>
