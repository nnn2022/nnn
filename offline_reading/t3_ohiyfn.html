    <strong>The more someone is educated the higher the chance they fall into a scam?</strong>
    <p><p>I wonder why? Usually the least bright fellas manage to see tru things, because they know they arent too bright in the first place. But highly educated fellas would analyse all the data and info and come to a conclusion where they are absolutely confident with their own thoughts that they would ignore peoples advise. Or they arent that smart to begin with and just happen to go tru college and universities and got their professional license etc?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think education or intelligence has anything to do with it.</p>
<p>It takes a conscious decision to seriously question the narrative and face what may be an uncomfortable truth.  It also requires actually being honest with what you find.  Most people just can’t or won’t do that.</p>

<p>All of this shit came out of the Humanities departments of major colleges, and spread to every facet of our culture. From the boardrooms at Disney, to the English class in your rural town school.</p>

        <p>"Trust the experts" is taught in higher education to the max. And I say this as someone who identifies as a leftist although I am disaffected. I almost was flunked out of college for questioning Outcome based Education, the early form of Common Core. I had As on the tests, that professor failed me for not conforming. And it was ALLOWED. I found another professor to take the class from,  kept mouth shut and got through but still hated how they were changing education.</p>

        <p>I think the elites plan to collapse education anyhow. How many are going to line up to put tens of thousands of dollars of student loans on their backs to watch classes on Zoom? The college bubble is something I've been watching for some time and it's about to burst. Their greed, departure from real education, and intellectual dishonesty, has made the foundations crumble beyond repair. Academia with it's slavish devotion to the powers that be doesn't even serve a purpose in our society anymore for discovery, real learning or progress. Let the college bubble burst. There's few jobs anymore waiting for those who take on the debt and the elite know it. They don't want educated serfs who stir up trouble. They may allow thin sliver to continue with education to keep power plants/heart surgeries running etc, the focus on STEM, but the humanities, arts etc, all that is going to be wiped away and the corrupt too helped make it happen.</p>

        <p>Me either. I liked a lot of things about college but now it's a money clean out and indocrination center. it's been corruptive. My alma matter plucked my pockets to the max building their sports arenas even 25 years ago. They didn't care if I was employable or not.-</p>

        <p>Its hard to teach critical thinking skills. The quality of education is not only the government curriculum, the teachers are what makes the education. </p>
<p>I had some teachers that I knew I had to just write the opinion they want to hear to pass the class. Other teachers would still give you grades even if your essay is in disagreement. </p>
<p>In the end I think some people have been trained to not think, likely just classical conditioning.</p>
<p>Bad grades for having an unapproved opinion.(negative reinforcement)</p>

        <p>Ask someone who is college educated when they finished thier education.  They will give you a definite answer.  Ask someone who never went to college the answer is typically "I never stop learning." Education has become indoctrination.</p>

        <p>That’s increasingly true, indeed, but a generalization for sure. As someone quite formally educated I’ve always considered myself in a constant state of learning. I know that’s not necessarily typical, but neither are completely uneducated intellectuals.</p>

        <p>My issue with these people who’re so adamant about a college education is multi-layered. First is this really what you want to do? When one ignores their true desire is how mental illness reveals itself. </p>
<p>Now the main focus. We have a system that produces degrees like a factory but no where near the positions for them once they graduate. Take a veterinarian for example, I’m going off memory so take my numbers with a grain of salt. For every 11 degrees there’s one job slot for them. Estimate this is a 300k education. Now if these 10 choose to work privately this floods the market so you have to undervalue your service. </p>
<p>Now take the countless graduates who can’t find a job in the field and are faced with becoming servers or a retail job. This is what develops these ultra privileged leftist groups. They have this elitist mentality in terms of thinking they’re educated, but now are truly facing the harsh truth the world offers and they can’t handle it.

        <p>I think it’s important to remind ourselves that we are all capable of falling for dogma and mistruth. Any of us thinking we have figured it out and are “better” than those who think differently probably need to do some major introspection about whether they as well have “fallen into a scam.”</p>

        <p>I have a friend with a PhD. My husband has a GED. But I guarantee if you put them both in a survivor situation, my husband will be the one who comes out alive. Imo, that's more important.

        <p>The reason stupid people have confidence and think they're intelligent is because they're unaware of what they don't know. These types of people are often agreeable and have shifty principals. Yes-men.</p>
<p>This also works in the opposite direction, to a lesser degree. Intelligent people are often aware they don't know everything, which is why intelligent people are more inclined to work in groups and collaborate.</p>

        <p>Book smarts and street smarts are two different ends of the spectrum. Today’s culture of helicopter parents seems to have damaged the ability to develop that skill set. You can only really develop that set of skills through life experience or if you’re lucky, smart enough to learn from others experience.</p>
<p>People can quote science,stats or whatever appeal to authority argument they present. But if you can’t spot a scam, trust your intuition, or realize you’re dealing with a predator all those books you read are pointless. I’ll just play off your weakness and take what I want. Not saying that’s my character, just saying it’s really that easy</p>

        <p>I think it depends, I would value a BS in chemical engineering over a PhD with a lame dissertation in women’s studies.  But to answer your question a lot of smart people trust the media and are maybe too busy to go out to find unconventional sources.  Look what CNN does they try to discredit other sources that don’t stick to the approved narrative.   Idk I’ve found that it takes work to find good sources, you have to pull and not just sit in front of the boob tube and let them push</p>
