    <strong>I was just assaulted in my building's elevator.</strong>
    <p><p>I just called the police 10m ago and my hands are still shaking. </p>
<p>I live in Vancouver BC, where it's not mandated to wear a mask in public areas like lobbies and elevators. https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/restrictions
Scroll down to "masks at workplaces and shared living areas." </p>
<p>For context I'm a 5'5 woman. A man in his mid-50s was in the elevator with me and put his hands all over me to try to shove me out of the elevator. They went up the back of my shirt. I feel sick. </p>
<p>I feel like giving up. I try not to wear the fucking thing and end up with some old man's hands all over me. I'm waiting for the police now and feel like I want to die.</p></p>

        <p>This has happened to me. Two ladies came at me to grab me by the hair after I dared to be maskless outdoors, and my SO had to step in to defend me. It was pretty frightening. I still try to go maskless outdoors, but I've had other run-ins, and it's very demoralizing, I will admit. I am not seeing any improvement, people seem to be getting more fanatical about masks, not less.</p>

        <p>Hopefully the police take your side.  A similar situation happened here.  A woman went into a store without a mask.  Had to pick up an essential item. A YOUNG man said she had to have a mask...she said i forgot but I just need one item. He then laid hands on her.  She immediately left the store and called police. </p>
<p>Thankfully police took her side.  Said sorry dipstick,  you can require a mask all you want.  You CANNOT physically assault a customer like that.</p>

        <p>Im not sure that's a valid court case. MAYBE civil court but youd need to prove damages, and I think proving you contracted COVID from a specific person is near impossible.</p>
<p>The reason cops arent enforcing the mask mandates is because they arent laws. By arresting people, they open themselves up to lawsuits. The police can only enforce state and federal law, they cannot enforce governor mandates. People seem to think the cops are choosing not to enforce because they side with "anti-maskers", but really they are covering their own asses. As long as no assault takes places (which is where a lot of the arrests come from unfortunately), you're good to go. It goes without saying to never lay hands on someone even if they get in your face about stupid mask shit.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I'm aware, I guess I should have pointed out I've never worn a mask and walk past police almost daily.</p>
<p>I'm just saying, people who know more about the law than I do always seem confident that the law is sane. I hope they are right, and that it remains that way.</p>
<p>Bonus incase you are really knowledgable about UK law: I just paid a £100 fine for lockdown protesting. They grabbed me out of a crowd from nowhere, put handcuffs on me tight and painfully behind my back and screamed in my face to give details. I initially protested and refused to give them anything and to tell me why I was being detained. All they say is "breach of Covid" it's hilarious if it wasn't our reality. </p>
<p>Anyway, they told me If I gave them my details they would escort me out of St. James' park and I would be free to go. That sounded like a better offer than a cell so I complied and then they arrested me anyway. Some of this was caught on film by various news crews. </p>
<p>I tried to reach out for advice to fight it in court out of principle rather than money but all you get is people yelling "don't pay fines" nobody actually helps or gives you specific advice. It was going to double to £200 and I'm already on a list, I don't want to encourage them to come knocking at my door, so yeah I paid. So many people have told me I'm an idiot and they don't take you to court but I just lost my job over this shit, we have to pick our battles.</p>
<p>So yeah, sorry for that ramble, I just wondered if you knew anything more about this. Sharing info is power.</p>
<p>Here's some more info: private company collecting fines and sending out letters is called ACRO, they have two people on the phones for the entire UK and if they are busy they just hang up. I had to call ten times before someone picked up. Bearing in mind if you don't pay they claim they can take you to court. It's so messed up.</p>

        <p>I'm assuming he lives in your building. That should make him a little easier to find, but unfortunately increases the chance of another run in. Being in Canada, concealed carry may not be an option, but keep some mace on you. Don't carry a knife because it can easily be turned on you.</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to me in Hamilton Ontario. I'm a 192cm (6'3") guy. The much smaller old guy wouldn't let go; he had his hands on me for around a full minute. That was a few months ago. Now masks are mandatory and there are signs all over my building instructing people to call the police if they see anyone not wearing one, so I guess he won.</p>

        <p>I wish that's all it took. A few reasons why exemption wouldn't have made a difference in that scenario. </p>
<p>The obvious one is that nobody attacking/yelling at the maskless are asking or would care of you had one. We've even seen footage on this sub of police tazing a woman with exemption.</p>
<p>The guy that attacked me did so in a place where masks were not mandatory, so exemption would be a non factor.</p>
<p>I tried getting exemption and was refused.</p>

        <p>Let me be clear I feel for you and I just want to help. You have to do whatever you feel comfortable doing, I'm sorry you got attacked. I'm 5'8" guy and I walk around smiling, but also with an air of "don't fuck with me" and hardly anyone has said anything. A masked moron got in my face in McDonalds once but he backed down when I didn't.</p>
<p>Doctors aren't giving out exemptions, you can't "get" one. You just have to be brave and exempt yourself. Western countries have laws against forcing things on you that cause distress, nobody, even police can demand private medical information. Read up on your rights and don't give in just because everyone around you has gone mad.</p>

<p>I'm in North Van, living in a building occupied mostly by people 65+. I see them running away from me (a young, maskless girl) or close the door in front of my face every day, just so I don't get in. It's not as extreme but still feels pretty awful...</p>
<p>I have recently moved here from Europe - all summer I've seen people not wearing masks outside, and generally treating them like a burden, but here there's a ton of masked people both in cars AND outside at all times...</p>

<p>There will be more of this until grown men wake the fuck up and stand up for people. I'm so fed up of pathetic people everywhere.</p>
<p>I have to also say that explaining the specific laws in your area is unncecessary. Nothing makes this OK. Even if there were mask mandates, people can be exempt. </p>
<p>I hope the police arrive as fast as they do when someone snitches on their neighbour but I don't have much faith.</p>

        <p>Ugh that’s really awful! You actually just made me notice the language in this public health order. My building has a notice saying masks required in common areas, not recommended as the Bc government website says. Others I know have the same thing in their buildings. This rule has been widely misinterpreted, even by me! The actual legal document doesn’t even mention condominiums or apartments. Wow! Tempted to print the actual law and but it on the building’s bulletin board but I’m sure someone will rip it down quick.</p>
