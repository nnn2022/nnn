    <strong>2 Idaho men arrested for mask refusal; dragged inside courthouse and charged with "failure to appear" while waiting at front door. (videos)</strong>
    <p><p>The following is from "peoples rights dot org" since mainstream media is already reporting contradictory to video evidence.</p>
<p>"Aaron Schmidt (one of our local area assistants) and Ammon Bundy (state assistant) had a Jury trial for their bogus trespassing charges when they were are at the capital building for Idaho's Special Legislative Session.  The trial was supposed to begin yesterday March 15th at 8:30 in the morning. They showed up prepared for their jury trial but were denied entry because they would not wear a mask.  They stayed right at the doors for several hours, asking to see the judge and to be let in.
Judge Manweiler and the prosecuting attorney were angry that they would not comply and wear a mask.  Judge Manweiler and the attorney knew Aaron and Ammon both showed up as scheduled but still worked together to sign a warrant for their arrest for “failure to appear”.  The local Ada sheriff’s officers came out of the courthouse and arrested Aaron, Ammon, and their two witnesses that were prepared to testify in court.</p>
<p><strong>Please watch the videos for yourself.</strong> </p>

<p>https://youtu.be/217ONlh3LCA - see the mark at 2 hour/40 minutes for the arrests</p>
<p>Video from Sherriff's office Tuesday 16th (hear Cate's update)  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=471564944038997&amp;id=100035564863260&amp;sfnsn=mo</p>
<p>Call to action - update about man with Parkinsons that was arrested. He was not given his mediations on time and was very ill in the jail. His wife demanded to be able to administer his meds and they finally complied late last night after more than 12 hours in jail: https://youtu.be/sEwfacNHp44
The police officers appear to have pushed through the crowd, injuring several people.  One of which had to be taken by an ambulance to the hospital.  Aaron and Ammon tried to appeal to the commissioners to fight for their right to enter the building and attend their trial.  Two of the commissioners are People’s rights members, and still do not know or understand their rights or the power that their position holds.</p>
<p>Aaron and Ammon were put into very cold holding cells because they refused a naked strip search due to religious reasons.  This cell consists of a concrete floor, nothing to sit on, an air conditioner pumps in cold air, while the officers take your shoes, socks and sweatshirt or coat.  The officers have come by every 15 minutes all night, making sure they didn't sleep, rattling the bars of the cells and banging on them.  Simply to break down Aaron and Ammon and get them to comply with demands.  The guards have refused to book them or put them in a regular cell. This treatment is barbaric.  Nobody deserves to be treated this way.</p>
<p>One woman was injured and went to the emergency room.  When asked what happened upon checking in, the hospital refused to treat her.  The injuries were inflicted by a police officer.  The hospital refused also to file a report about the battery.  The man taken by ambulance sustained injuries and was last known to be waiting on a CT scan.
We need to stand for them.  If we can’t show up to the jail in person and stand as a witness, we need to call the jail.  Bombard them with calls demanding they arraign Aaron and Ammon.  It’s been 24 hours of this treatment.  The jail is refusing to let Aaron or Ammon see the judge, per their right to do, so they can plead guilty or not guilty.</p>
<p>Last night Caitlyn (Aaron’s wife) called the jail. They lied to Cate telling her Aaron was in a regular cell now, not the cold cell, and that it was simply too late to talk to him. That he didn’t have access to a phone.  When she finally spoke to Aaron this morning, she realized the severity of the situation and how much of what the jail told her was a lie.  They instead refused to let Aaron have his phone call to his wife or anyone else. This is against his rights as well!!</p>
<p>People's Rights need boots on the ground in Boise to show support at the jail; at the courthouse; as there are other cases going on as well; to protest in front of the judge's home; and possibly a couple other places. </p>
<p>People's Rights also need people to contact</p>

This could be any of us in the future.  Simply for not complying to “wear a mask” or “be vaccinated”, or whatever ridiculous thing elected officials say we must do for “the greater good”.  The commissioner they spoke to at the courthouse yesterday said this whole situation is completely political (we knew that).  That it wasn’t right the way they were being treated.   And yet it’s happening.  Their rights are being stripped from them.  Folks, please take a minute to do something. If you know any way to help them, or put pressure to have them released, reach out to an area assistant."</p>

        <p>I believe the state has no such mandate but individual cities require it, as probably do certain government buildings like the courts. That may change, though https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/politics/idaho-mask-prohibition-law-house/277-f155c2d9-938c-48e4-b46b-dde348909e2d</p>

        <p>This seems like the perfect thing to run to federal court and file a “habus corpus appeal” which means the federal court will review the legality of the incarceration, I believe you can do this in any federal court but not a lawyer. This is absolutely bullshit and authoritarian ..</p>

        <p>Ammon Bundy has something of a record for standing up to the federal and state governments and getting them pissed off at him. In 2015 he and his father organized a militia in a standoff with a bunch of federal agents that wanted to repossess his land or something like that, I admit I don't know the whole story very well (wiki article here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff). I suspect that this treatment of the Bundys specifically is the state being vindictive for that incident. Terrible that it happened to him, and totally wrong, but also probably not what a citizen without his record of giving the government trouble could reasonably expect.</p>

        <p>Well that standoff happened in a different state(oregon), and the feds murdered LaVoy Finicum. The building they "took over" is empty for half the damn year anyways, it was empty when they "took it over". Also over half of the people on the inside were later found out to be FBI -- they were looking for something in that building</p>
<p>There is another person who was "trespassed" on the same day for the same reason. Basically during "emergency special session" one of the committee chairs decided he didn't like citizen journalists at the "press table" in the committee room. The state police (who shouldn't legally even be INSIDE the capitol building working) drag out the citizen journalists and trespass them. </p>
<p>While they were arguing in the hallway of the capitol, Ammon Bundy and Aaron Schmidt walked up to the press table, sat down, and refused to leave. The court appearance in question, is for this very incident that happened back in august 2020.</p>
