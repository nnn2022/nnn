    <strong>My four year old is protesting</strong>
    <p><p>Our kids (4 and 2) have been back to daycare since June. They aren’t required to masks (teachers are) and no cases reported. </p>
<p>We’ve been playing with our immediate neighbors kids freely this whole time. I wear the mask when in stores ect unless I have an indication that that the owners think it’s BS. </p>
<p>Recently the neighborhood kids have finally been playing together, but some of them wear masks. </p>
<p>My 4 year old just went over to play at our immediate neighborhoods house and all of the kids were wearing masks outside. They asked him to wear one and he came back home saying that he doesn’t want to wear one when playing. No. New. Normal.</p></p>

        <p>Look at that kid, thinking independently! You must be very proud :) </p>
<p>Just be mindful of the fact that it can be lonely going against the crowd, no matter how unassailable your position is... especially for children who are learning how to fit in socially. If you can, try to reward him with extra awesome activities so he doesn’t have time to feel like he’s “missing out.”</p>

        <p>Probably both. He observed his parents’ behavior and then chose to apply it with his peers, when his parents weren’t present and the group took a different stance.</p>

        <p>Probably somewhere in between, becoming independent usually isn't a sudden process. Even if he wore a mask, you could argue that he still isn't thinking independently, only doing what his friends are doing. Either way, he made a judgement call.</p>

        <p>As a child, I was always "the weird kid" and didn't conform, so it led to <strong>a lot</strong> of bullying. Even as an adult, I still got bullied at various jobs. So just saying, you need to teach your child to not let bullying bother him, and the proper ways of handling bullies. It's rough out there, especially now with kids beginning to accept the "New Normal" (I saw a lot more resistance from kids months ago, but I've seen less kids resistant to it in recent times).</p>

        <p>Kids adapt into the majority. Part of growing up is learning to fit in with the group, which is social conformity - one reason why bullying is such an issue (it strengthens the bully’s place “in” the group by picking on an “outsider”). Shove masks in their face everyday, eventually they’ll start accepting it. </p>
<p>The fact that kids are slowly being beaten into accepting masks and dehumanizing behavior is tragic. I am so concerned for this generation of children.</p>

        <p>Yes. Exactly.</p>
<p>And I remember seeing kids resisting masks months ago, as I wrote before. Now I am seeing less crying or screaming kids, less kids fighting with parents over masks, and so on. Lots of kids seem to be adapting to them. My neighbors' child relatives wear masks when swimming or playing in the backyard now. It makes me so angry, to be honest. Does the government even need to step in and enforce this shit, when the average citizen is policing their fellow man, including their own children?</p>

        <p>It is beyond tragic, and that conversation is mostly not happening either.</p>
<p>I did find <a href="https://lbry.tv/@LockdownSkepticism:f/ACU-+Prof.+Franz+Ruppert+-+The+impact+of+the+pandemic+from+a+psychological+point+of+view:e">this</a> video where Professor Ruppert goes into the psychological impact of this whole thing. It's a long video (super worth it) - if you don't have the time just go to around 22 or 23 minute mark where they show the "Still Face" experiment. They show a mother playing with her infant, how it responds to the emotional / facial cues/expressions and how immediately the infant is adversely impacted once the mother turns back around and maintains an expressionless face, ignoring the baby's cries and pleas to get her back. It's honestly heart breaking to see, now with that in mind just try to imagine the impact of seeing their parents, siblings and everyone else in masks.</p>
<p>To say nothing of the effects of all the rest of the measures in school and so on.  Ugh....</p>

        <p>I agree and i cant think of a kid that hasn’t been bullied. His thoughts are probably influenced by us and imagine that’ll change one day when he wants to conform to his peers. Luckily the other kids weren’t bullying him-just stating what they’ve been told. I did reluctantly say that he could wear a mask if he wanted since we do the same when out (even though we disagree with it). He said no thanks lol whatever he plays 40 hours a week with maskless kids.</p>

        <p>Good job buddy!! Masks outside are particularly stupid. Honestly- any families who required that would not be the type I’d want my kid hanging around anyway. If they are that crazy about this, they are probably crazy about other stuff too (the types who will freak out if you let their kid have a cookie etc). I avoid those types in general.</p>

        <p>4 year olds are the best! Does it really make a difference if the kid wears a mask when the next second he’s opening his mouth? Last time my son put on a mask was at the doc, who expressed that it was silly but had to follow regs.</p>

<p>Your 4 year old has more independent thought going on than grown men I know. Sad but amazing at the same time. This actually gives me hope for the future of humanity, we need more people like that.</p>

        <p>Good to see there’s hope for this tiny generation just starting out....Maybe he will be the next Moses. A leader.  This is what we need. Aren’t we supposed to show our children not to succumb to peer pressure and also to question things and not just accept what their told? My son growing up was alienated as a young teen for not following what the rest were doing. Although those times were rough we continued to remind him that he was standing up for his beliefs , values and convictions and he would be glad in the end... Ten years or so later those who chose to follow the crowd, continue to do so and haven’t really accomplished much. However, our son has learned to be an independent thinker, unafraid to try new things and now serves our community in law enforcement which is frowned upon heavily where we live which is not surprisingly a progressive city. Again, he is alienated by many of his generation but stands by his decisions and trusts his own mind. If we teach our children to be brave like a wolf when they are young , they won’t be meek like sheep as adults.  It’s called character. Good for your child. Be proud 👍</p>
