    <strong>What the actual fuck is wrong with people? Is the future doomed?</strong>
    <p><p>Just the last couple days, I've seen a thread on Reddit where some kid "egged an anti-masker", and despite the fact that the fucking CDC themselves changed their guidance, the comments were all celebrating and even saying "they should be charged for MURDER", along with other dehumanizing insults like plague rats, undesirables, or "antivaxxers should be denied certain things in society", killers.... horrific, and guess what? All simply because they're skeptical of a vaccine that doesn't even complete trials until 2023 (as Pfizer THEMSELVES admitted!)</p>
<p>Source for Pfizer: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fa5866942937a4d73918723/6018018e4b1729f3251e4281_UKMFA_Pfizer_COVID-19_Vaccine_(Public1-2).pdf</p>
<p>"43,538 people had been enrolled in the Phase 3 trial by early December 2020 .
The study does not end until January 2023; <strong>people who take the vaccine should be aware that it is still essentially experimental.</strong>" RIGHT HERE</p>
<p>Do these morons even realize what's coming out of their mouths? I bet if the ~~propaganda machine~~ television said something like "drinking your own piss will help recover from Covid because (insert whatever pseudoscience here)", I'm sure the majority are going to follow unquestionably. Bunch of tired old mills. </p>
<p>Honestly, if the elites are laughing at this comedy, I don't blame them at this point. Holy shit!!</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I wrote a whole thing in response to a Doomer (who predictably never read it) on another thread. I'll copy/pasta here:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The 7 Signs You're In A Cult</p>
<p>Opposing critical thinking</p>
<p>You guys: Don't read, don't watch, don't think. Any opposing views are immediately censored, even simple questions that might be perceived as even slightly questioning the narrative are deleted. Information directly from the CDC website is labeled as "misinformation" if it's framed in a way that's negative toward the vaccine.</p>
<p>Us: We let you guys troll in here all day. Hell, most of us try to help you see the light. We provide links (you never read), we provide videos (you never watch), we try to reason with you using the same data you have and you don't think. We try very hard to get you to use critical thinking. You guys just refuse. Probably because you're in a cult. But keep reading, you'll see why I say that!</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolating members and penalizing them for leaving.</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: Do I really even have to explain this one? You people are very violent about forcing people to take the vaccine. You literally want people's rights to be taken away if they don't comply to be a test subject in an experiment. You doxx anyone that questions the narrative, and many subs now auto-ban anyone that comments here. Even if it's just to troll. Want to work? Vaccine. Want to see your friends? Vaccine. Want to be a human being? Vaccine.</p>
<p>Us: We obviously welcome anyone willing to ask questions and have an open mind. We also don't dox, ridicule, or block people who admit to having the vaccine, or thinking of taking the vaccine. We believe in choice - not compulsion.</p>
<ol>
<li>Emphasizing special doctrines outside scripture</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: In this case, the CDC is the "scripture," and your mainstream news outlets are the special doctrines. When the CDC was all about turning you into a cave dweller, everyone was all about their rules! Listen to the CDC! Trust the science! But when the CDC says it's okay to take off masks, stop social distancing, go back to work...you people are still violently holding onto the masks and distancing - and literally attacking people who are following CDC guidelines of going back to normal!</p>
<p>Us: Hey, score one for you, because I would say we do that more than anyone! Only because we have to, though, because your special doctrine (MSM) has taken over all forms of readily available communication. We have to go to other sources to find the truth, usually from censored medical professionals and fired undercover news reporters. We certainly wish the media was a reliable source, though!</p>
<ol>
<li>Seeking inappropriate loyalty to their leaders</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: Praise be to Lord Fauci, may a thousand masks be upon him! James Corden shall sing songs in his name, and many works of art will bare his holy face!!</p>
<p>Us: Fuck all world leaders right now. Every last one of them. We have no leaders, because we are free thinkers. I would say we all probably like Zuby though for sure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dishonoring the family unit</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: How many posts have been made in here of people bemoaning the fact that they're the only person in their family not to be a test subject, and how horrible and vile their family is to them? Very rarely do we get a post where the OP says that their family is being respectful of their decision. Maybe 1 out 12.</p>
<p>Us: Yeah, it's very simple. You can get the vaccine if you want. We don't care. All we ask is that you don't make us and you mind your own business about it. We don't care if you're "afraid" or you think we'll "kill grandma." You're very behind the science on that. We aren't going to ruin our lives because of your ignorance. Be the test subject. Have fun. Leave us out of it. We may be disappointed in family members that get the vaxx, but we don't act anything like you animals.</p>
<ol>
<li>Crossing Biblical boundaries of behavior (sexual purity and personal ownership)</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: Literally want to physically force the vaccine on people, or take away their basic human rights if we don't comply. You want vaccine passports, in order to work and travel. You want to make anyone who does not want to be a test subject into a subhuman person. Comply or die! You want to remove bodily autonomy - a God-given right.</p>
<p>Us: WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF YOU GET THE VACCINE OR WEAR A MASK. GO FOR IT. JUST LEAVE US OUT OF IT. We don't attack you for getting it, we don't dox you or harass you. But you better believe, we are ready to defend ourselves against your tyranny.</p>
<ol>
<li>Separation from the Church (Society)</li>
</ol>
<p>You guys: As I've detailed many times above, and as you've surely stated yourself, you don't see us as humans. You see us as plague rats. For a "plague" that's currently killing almost no one in a world of over 7 billion people. You want us removed from society - probably put in camps, I bet - until we comply with your little experiment. Until we're in the same sinking ship as you. You're quite literally evil people, and you're quite literally - by textbook definition - in a cult.</p>
<p>Us: Well, you're trying to separate us... but here we are... together :)</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for playing, VERIFIABLE CULTIST</p>

        <p>Most of it is direct propaganda from groups (like the former "shareblue") or directly from the CCP (these are easy to find though, as they repeat the same wording, and all their posts get an unusually high number of awards)</p>

<p>The longer this BS goes on the more on board I am getting with the depopulation agenda. At this point I only disagree with its target. Personally I would start with almost every world leader and politician then work through all the Branch Covidians.</p>

        <p>There was a video posted here few times the other day &amp; it’s gone viral elsewhere…..it’s at a hardware store and an employee attacks a unmasked man with a bat. When I saw it on twitter there were a lot of replies saying the unmasked man should be charged with attempted murder! My God what are we doing here? Today my local police put out a press release about a man arrested after an ongoing dispute with a neighbor. The man was man because the neighbor allegedly threw stuff at his house so the man rounded up 2 teens and all 3 went &amp; beat the shit out of the neighbor and people were saying the neighbor should have been the one arrested instead of the ones who beat him up!! It’s like covid has changed the way people think in so many ways. A minor non-violent offense is now good reason to beat someone to a pulp or imprison them for years! And the person doing the beating is the innocent one. I will say being a Californian, it’s funny seeing all the people who vote for the progressive policies and politicians that resulted in no cash bail and the decriminalization of petty crime complain when someone isn’t thrown in jail! They voted for that shit! And then they wonder why the cops won’t come out and dust for fingerprints &amp; launch a full investigation when their car gets broken in to!</p>

        <p>So I looked into the source that your source used,  because I too am embroiled in a debate with leftists, and the end date is not mentioned in it. I read it 3 times, maybe I missed it but I doubt it. If you find it lete know. </p>
<p>https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04368728</p>
<p>This is where you can find that information with much less reading. And it's now ending March 2023. I'm assuming because they are now testing booster shots.</p>
