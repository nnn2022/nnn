<title>Is there definitive proof or even credible evidence that COVID "lives" on surfaces for hours let alone days? Does it even matter anymore? Nothing can cure what truly ails us now.

    <p><p>From the UK Times yesterday (Sunday 4th October"):</p>
<p>"The surprises keep on coming in the fight against the coronavirus. One of the most frightening things the world thought it knew about Covid-19 is turning out to be not very scary at all. <strong>New research into the infectious potential of contaminated surfaces has forced a downgrading of early concerns that people might fall ill by touching a door knob or a light switch. “The surface issue has essentially gone away,” a leading American specialist in infectious diseases declared."</strong></p>

<p>Being that viruses are not truly biologically alive and usually die without a host in a matter of minutes, 2020 is yet again proving to be an "unprecedented year".</p>
<p>I heard from a reliable source that the initial Chinese story of COVID being transmitted via bank notes was swiftly debunked, but deliberately ignored in the MSM due to globalist desires to finally create a cashless economy. </p>
<p>28th July 2020: "The World Health Organization has said there is <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-we-did-not-say-that-cash-was-transmitting-coronavirus-2020-03-06">no evidence</a> that currency notes transmit coronavirus. The virus lasts just as long on plastic cards, and Christine Tait-Burkard, an infectious disease expert at the University of Edinburgh, said that <a href="https://www.cashmatters.org/blog/faq-cash-is-safe-to-use-in-times-of-coronavirus/">cash is not a vector of disease</a> “unless someone is using a banknote to sneeze in”. </p>

<p>Have been looking for confirmation of this, but it's proving tough. Any ideas or leads?</p>
<p>In the meantime, let's take a look at a few of the 'surface' studies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/study-suggests-new-coronavirus-may-remain-surfaces-days">https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/study-suggests-new-coronavirus-may-remain-surfaces-days</a></p>
<p>"Viruses <strong>can</strong> live for a time on surfaces outside the human body. According to the CDC, it <strong>may</strong> be possible to contract the virus responsible for the current outbreak, SARS-CoV-2, by touching a surface or object with the virus on it and then touching your face. However, SARS-CoV-2 <strong>is believed</strong> to mostly spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 remained active on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for two to three days under the conditions in this experiment. It remained infectious for up to 24 hours on cardboard and four hours on copper. The virus was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours. These times will vary under real-world conditions, depending on factors including temperature, humidity, ventilation, and the amount of virus deposited."</p>
<p>This was early on, so tentativity is perhaps understandable (though it was likely the results of studies like this to which we're still adhering).</p>
<p>The highly-compromised Lancet, had this to say however (July 3rd 2020):</p>
<p>"Exaggerated risk of transmission of COVID-19 by fomites:</p>
<p>A clinically significant risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission by fomites (inanimate surfaces or objects) has been assumed on the basis of studies that have little resemblance to real-life scenarios. The longest survival (6 days) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on surfaces was done by placing a very large initial virus titre sample (10⁷ infectious virus particles) on the surface being tested.1  Another study that claimed survival of 4 days used a similarly large sample (10⁶ infectious virus particles) on the surface.2  A report by van Doremalen and colleagues found survival of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 of up to 2 days (on surfaces) and 3 days (in aerosols generated in the laboratory), but again with a large inoculum (10⁵–10⁷ infectious virus particles per mL in aerosols, 10⁴ infectious virus particles on surfaces).3</p>
<p>Yet another study found long survival (5 days) of human coronavirus 229E on surfaces with what I would still consider a substantially large viral load (10³ plaque-forming units) in a cell lysate.4  However, using a cell lysate rather than purified or semipurified virus might enable initial viral proliferation or protection from the effects of the sample drying out. <strong>None of these studies present scenarios akin to real-life situations</strong>."</p>

<p><strong>There are plenty of studies I'm missing, please feel free to drop them in the comments.</strong></p>

        <p>My understanding is there is a lipid based coating around the virons that has to break down before the virus will be chemically destroyed. I don't see why it wouldn't last on surfaces for hours to days depending on the surface and conditions.</p>
<p>"The virus was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours." It's amazing to me how the virus spreading in aerosol seems to be dependent on the current answer to the question of: does a mask work with aerosols. If they think the answer is yes then it spreads that way. If they think the answer is no then it doesn't spread that way.</p>
