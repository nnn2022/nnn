        <p>My wake up call to what he was saying after 9/11, as people began to question what was going on. At first, I thought the man crazy, but when I started digging to verify what he was saying, that was when I had my "oh shit. . . .what the f00k is going on" moment.</p>

        <p>That was my moment as well. It's that whole Building 7 thing that to this day boggles my mind that we don't have massive uproar over it comming down even though no plane struck it.</p>

        <p>The twin towers make no sense either.</p>
<p>It's crazy to think about now, but one of my highschool teachers showed us a 9/11 conspiracy doc in class. That was my first redpill at 16. She probably could have gotten fired for that. </p>
<p>We also learned 1984 in her class and she said we weren't too far off from that kind of dystopia. Of course we laughed it off, not taking it too seriously. I didn't really like her at the time but looking back she was pretty cool and certainly wasn't afraid to speak her mind. This was about a decade ago.</p>

        <p>Structural engineer here.  To think aluminum planes with minimal jet fuel could bring down the twin towers is so extremely laughable.  You could fly hundreds of jets into the towers before causing them to collapse.  Steel beats aluminum 100% of the time.  Obviously this also isn't looking at tower 7 which fell due to office fires? Wtf lol</p>

        <p>To this day, no one can explain to me the feasibility of an office fire collapsing a full steel reinforced building. There was a fire in a building in Spain, the fire continued for over 24 hours, and the building did not even collapse. Man, I wish I could find that video but that along with the Building 7 information was like a huge thing for me. It was like a confirmation that I wasn't crazy for thinking the way I was thinking. Here's a building that also burned a long time in England (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IReIUJd5B_o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IReIUJd5B_o</a>), and the whole building was engulfed in flames. But you know what? It never fell or collapsed!</p>

        <p>Yup it's not physically possible and many people know this.  A large portion of the population can not take any info as truth unless it's directly from the MSM, no matter how obvious the lies are. </p>

        <p>I had a English teacher our class tell us that the United States is on the human rights abuse list. Keep in mind, this is like 1994/1993. I thought the lady was crazy; I really did think this. How could she question the greatest nation in the world? At least that is what I was thinking, and oh yeah, she had us read the book 1984 and Animal Farm. I did not pay attention to any of those books at all until my eyes were opened.</p>
<p>None the less, fast forward to September 11, 2001, and about 6 months later, and listening to scientists, and structural engineers talk about the towers, and how it was impossible to melt steel at the temperature they were suggesting, and the Towers and Building 7 falling the way they did, suddenly then I didn't think she or Alex Jones were crazy any more.</p>
<p>I find it weird how people find their "ah ha" or "oh shit" moments and they realize, like yourself and I, we're not in Kansas any more!</p>

        <p>/u/Walking-HR-Violation, funny you say that about Building 7!!! That was the key fact that every one kept bringing up which led me to how it was impossible for the Twin Towers to fall the way they did.</p>
<p>I happened to have went to lower Manhattan with my sister about a year later, and there was a 9/11 Truth Rally, and one the most remarkable things one of the protesters doing was a simple demonstration on how it was impossible for the towers to fall they way they did. </p>
<p>The protester did a simple experiment. He simply said, physics is around us every day, it doesn't take a break or vacation, it is not like the movies, and then he did this: he threw his car keys up in the air, and let drop to the ground. He then proceeds to say, did you notice there nothing there to stop from free falling to the ground, did you notice it still traveled at 32 ft / second squared and compared it to how the towers fell, and asked, how is it possible?! Every one including myself jaw dropped and were just silent. Why? Because he was right!</p>
<p>Ever since then, I learned the hard way, never trust what the media or government tells you, it might just get you killed.</p>

        <p>No steel high rise in world history has collapsed from fire alone. Many have been fully engulfed in flames for days without compromising structural integrity. Tower 7 collapsed in hours. NIST had to invent a new form of structural failure to describe how Tower 7 collapsed. NIST will not release their finite element simulation data to the public. This is basic stuff, I can literally just got to my thermo property tables from college and tell you that building cannot collapse from fire alone.</p>
<p>I’m not getting into who did it or why, but that building was taken down with explosives.</p>
