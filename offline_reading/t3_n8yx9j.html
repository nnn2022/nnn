    <strong>God or Universe.. please give me the strength</strong>
    <p><p>To not conform to this broken society and give in to the jab.</p>
<p>Everyday I feel like there’s a war going on inside my head because almost everyone I know is getting the jab, dropping like flies one by one and it’s starting to tear me apart.</p>
<p>Especially as the U.K. is starting to “open up”, the pressure is mounting.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that my fall will be when leisure opens up and potentially requires it, maybe even the social life pressure I’ll be able to withstand...</p>
<p>But the love life element is killing me knowing that I’m in a significant minority (gay bloke who is against the whole woke regime etc) in not getting the jab as well if my employer potentially mandates it.</p>
<p>Currently I go to Alcoholics / Narcotics anonymous obviously to avoid escaping reality by means of abusing substances but also to help keep my mind sharp and discipline myself to not allow my primal side to conform to what “feels” good, eg leisure, social life etc. which may also require the jab as I mentioned.</p>
<p>To whatever force is out there. Please. Please give me the strength. </p>
<p>Comments and thoughts are welcome.</p></p>

        <p>All I can say is - stay strong. It might not seem like it but you can find a partner who is against this also. </p>
<p>Don’t give in to the people who want to forcibly inject you with an experimental poison. You wouldn’t want someone like that in your life anyway.</p>

        <p>Stay strong! I truly believe this is a spiritual battle! Nothing pushed this hard is for our own good! I believe this is the end times and this is my hill to die on. Bodily autonomy is where I say no! Your body belongs to you! You’re not alone! They’ll try to make feel alone though. You’re more than welcome to message me or anyone else on this sub if you feel alone, because you’re not. This is our last stand. You’re brave, or you wouldn’t be here in the first place.</p>

        <p>Same. In the end, God wins. It may be a very difficult path for us, but we have to resist.</p>

        <p>God will help you out, if you really call out and pray for help. I suggest you pick up a Bible, and start reading, especially the NT, Matthew, John. I did not believe in God and the Bible 10 years ago, but now it's so obvious to me. There is nothing that disproves the Bible, although they try to with fake science. I've seen small miracles happen as well, which I cannot deny. He WILL help all those that call for help.
As for alcohol, try to find a good tasting alcohol free beer (0.5%), which will take some tries because most are crap. Then, stock up on it big so you'll have to drink that. Source: i did/do the same.</p>
<p>Also, the Universe as told does not exist. It's just us, earth. Don't fall for the lies that 99% of the people believe in. God trusts in the 1% that is different, the ones who dare to see the truth of it all, and suffer through being outcast by the rest. God bless.</p>

        <p>Yes! I’ve always believed in God but these last few moths have made it more obvious, for sure. Praying and my Bible are what keep me sane. In a way, this whole Earthly deception has been a blessing. Hopefully, more will turn to God. He will bring you comfort!</p>

        <p>Just a brief word of encouragement; from someone "society" likes to think is "opposite" of you. </p>
<p>I'm 50, straight, married with children, and in the States. </p>
<p>We're not different. We're all in this fight for our autonomy together. </p>
<p>The push comes from every direction. Every angle. It is manipulation, pure and simple. They want us to break down, to give in, to become part of The Borg. </p>
<p>They never seem to allow for the strength of the human spirit. That people bond together and become stronger when faced with challenge. </p>
<p>Oceans, faiths, social circles, cultures fall away when the fight is for our humanity!</p>

        <p>Hi. I am a bisexual female. I have gay friends who are against the insane news bs. You are not alone gay or not there are many people who fit in our category. I've seen fabulous drag queens refuse the mask. Being cool is not being basic. Remember that love.</p>

        <p>I love you man. This life is a battle of good and evil. It will teach you things. We will all die and be with God again. Try to breathe, learn to meditate and stop your mind. </p>
