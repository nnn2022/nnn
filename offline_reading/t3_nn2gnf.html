    <strong>When will it be acceptable to suggest that the Coronavirus was being actively spread in Democracies every time there was a "Surge"?</strong>
    <p><p>Now that it is no longer a conspiracy to think it may have leaked from a bio-lab in Wuhan... It's had me wondering why no one in the entire world even thinks to suggest that the virus was intentionally spread multiple times over the last year and a half.</p>
<p>No one talks about how the virus seemed to target all of the world's largest democracies. How it almost instantly jumped from China to rural retirement homes in the US... as if the people that work or live there always fly back and forth to china and Europe.</p>
<p>Back in the early post-9/11 days, if a "Covid Lockdown" happened - I guarantee the majority of Americans would suspect AQ was spreading it around the world.</p>
<p>But at no time has anyone in "The Intelligence Agencies" or Military even mentioned the idea that this has been bio-warfare or bio-terror. Even though it is literally their job to at least suspect the possibility.</p>
<p>Intentional spreading of the virus would also explain how the reactions vary so much - People exposed to the direct spread could be the ones getting it "The Worst", and then incidental spread beyond that wasn't as bad for people.</p>
<p>But suddenly, for some reason, we can only think it all started from that one leak in wuhan... Where before the "Logical" conclusion was "Some dude ate a bat"... And then spread from that one single source. But never once did people ask "Is someone intentionally spreading it? Are there multiple leaks? Are they intentional leaks?"</p>
<p>And if anyone even suggests that concept - they are a crazy conspiracy theorist. Just like the people who suggested it was more likely that a lab that was intentionally messing with this specific virus leaked.</p>
<p>Where are the Intelligence agencies of the world? Still trying to figure out Russian facebook and twitter mind control from 2016 I guess... Or perhaps investigating the Trump Supporters who didn't burn anything down or spray paint over statues or topple them...</p></p>

<p>I don't know. If I were a communist country, and I saw that all the old people in democracies hated communism and all the young people think it's hip and cool... A virus designed to kill mostly old people may be a nice thing.</p>

        <p>It depends on the ends that were intended.  To be a bio-weapon it does not need to kill everyone who contracts it.  It can be a bio weapon solely created to induce mass panic, the shutdown of global economy, lockdowns,  and the ushering in of widespread use of the least-secure voting method in the upcoming 2020 U.S. Presidential election.</p>

        <p>We can't confirm it, but we can't refute it. So - it is possible, I even saw several documents where doctors themselves brought this theory to the table, due to their ambiguities regarding - everything. I remember how and where the disease spread in Europe. The epicentres were in the ski resorts in the Alps ...</p>
