    <strong>No one thinks about anything anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>I went to a bar and masks were required to enter the bar but once you enter you can take it off and eat and drink.  I did not have a mask and told the door person and they said I could buy one inside the bar.  She let me go in without and mask and buy a mask from the bar and then I had to go back outside and put it on and walk back in where I just was and take it off to order my drink.  I was only one who thought this was utterly retarded.</p></p>
