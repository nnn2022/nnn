        <p>Way too much weird shit around the people who make and push the vaccines. Way too many reports of illness and death that they admit to. They admit there is stuff in the vaccines that make people ill. This covid vaccine is new type of vaccine. The trials have made many ill. They are trying to force it too. Which is enough to make you ask...what the fuck are you people trying to do? Get that shit away from me.</p>

        <p>I just had an awful new thought. Part of the argument about getting a vaccine if you’re not at risk is that you protect people who can’t have it - for example the immunocompromised.</p>
<p>Since everyone and their mother now seems to be ‘immunocompromised’ on the Internet are we about to see the rise of a bunch of people who are scared of the new vaccine but still manage to come up with a bunch of reasons why YOU should take it to protect their self diagnosed ass?</p>

        <p>Even short term effects are problematic.  Operation Warp Speed in the USA is set to vaccinate millions across the country all at once starting on December 11th.  If there were adverse reactions on the West coast, people in the East would opt out.  </p>
<p>In much the same way that media can spin COVID into what ever they want and whistleblowers are shunned.  Vaccinations will be positively promoted, with injury or death labeled anti-vaxx conspiracy theories.  Videos of crying mothers showing what happened to their child, removed from platforms etc.<br>
This is done already with vaccine injury, you better believe they'll do it for the largest vaccination operation in history.</p>

        <p>That is one of the most selfish things to say ever.</p>
<p>I hope you realize ,that this means ,as soon as you'd once get more seriously sick, you are fucked basically, unless you are rich.  That's why you have it so great in USA ,that the terminal illness can bankrupt you ,even if you are insured. Well enjoy it  IG. I still prefer to stick to European universal health care ,covered by our taxes, and you don't die here while waiting for cancer treatment either.</p>

        <p>I dunno about that, as i dunno what kind of drain bad habits actually are.</p>
<p>But, if you go with such pointing of the finger on who's to blame ,then the concept of making ppl who oppose the current corona restrictions and vaccines pay for their treatments is only a step away. After all they/we did to ourselves once we'd get sick and if needed help in the eyes of the med. system if that was the case...</p>
<p>There are many kinds of bad habits ,as ppl need some sorts of stress release and sure, some have less self control then others, which does not means that they need to be thrown of the "free" services ,as they are mostly contributing for them as well by paying their taxes. Can't expect everyone to be like those slim wanna be happy ,ppl on edgy smoothie vids and high on life.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah ,ever heard of deductibles and fine prints and un.-covered pre-existing conditions ? I kinda know US system cos my GF is there, poor and and has to pay out of pocket every-time she gets sick or even sees the dr. despite having an "insurance" which she can barely afford, despite her working full time. Many work full time and can't afford it at all. But i get it ,you prolly aren't poor to that extent ,so you don't care on how millions of poorer Americans live.  This is the Me ,me me mentality i was talking about and is the reason why we'll start our future in EU and not in USA. Otherwise ,i have nothing against USA at all ,but yeah, if you are gonna be poor it's not really a place to be, and i hope you won't ever find yourself in that situation. We have the insurance too, but they aren't making us pay for anything when shit gets rough. </p>
<p>And i know someone who's there and quite wealthy too, with like good insurance and got a chirosis. And now he has to pay around 100k which he doesn't have ,bcs the "insurance" found something to cancel the liability. Shit like this is unheard of over here.</p>

        <p>Well in tax based society you are forced to pay for other ppl and vice versa, that's how it works. I don't mind it ,as long as the salary is big enough to have a decent life.</p>

        <p>I live in Canada, and the government has put a hold on cancer treatment, heart surgeries, joint surgeries, and most other “elective” surgeries. The amount of people that died here from heart failure or cancer because their treatment was cancelled is shocking. The government gets to pick who lives and dies, meanwhile most of our hospitals are almost empty because people are too afraid to go, and nearly no one needs to be hospitalized from COVID. That’s the problem with socialized medicine, ultimately politicians get to decide if you live or die.</p>

<p>Nah, that's the problem with brainwashed ppl ,who are driven by fear and won't come near hospitals ,but sure they've managed to convince you very nicely that everyone should pay for their treatments and to be afright of socialized medicine, despite the fact that pretty much the whole world has some form of called social medicine. I won't comment on how you have it in Canada ,but here in Slo you get your treatments ,but you have to know ,that this country is waaay less into NWO and fear-mongering than you guys are. We have the lockdowns too ,but nearly not so much of propaganda and shit of that nature. </p>

        <p>In Canada the government has banned many people from going to the hospital to treat illnesses they’ve been battling for a long time, and many people have died because of it. It’s nothing to do with people being paranoid or brainwashed. The government has either outright banned it, or they’ve been the ones doing the brainwashing. There’s been government advertisement telling people not to go to hospital for any reason unless they’re imminently dying because they will catch Covid. Because the government is banning hospitals from performing many treatments for heart disease, kidney disease, and cancer, they’re essentially telling the sickly that their lives are worth less. I’m not saying that “pay your own way” healthcare is necessarily better, but single payer medicine doesn’t seem to be working out much better here.</p>

        <p>Vaccines usually takes 4+ years to develop, as effects occur over time and they need to wait to learn of these. This vaccine hasn't even been in trials for 1. I'm not comfortable with that being safe, but it doesn't mean I'm anti vax. I'm not at risk from covid so I'd probably be in more danger taking a still pretty experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>I would accept bot being able to go to public hospitals if get covid without getting the vaccine. Think of how many ways government intrudes in your life because they have to pay for your medical bills: most drugs are illegal, warning labels and extremely high taxes on legal drugs, mandatory vaccines in some countries. If you want the government to pay for your expenses as if it was your parent, be aware that it will control your life like a parent.</p>

        <p>Yeah i don’t really want any of those things. I would like to roll back as much government intrusion in my life as possible. The government also doesn’t pay for anything, the taxpayers do. The taxpayers are purchasing healthcare as a service in countries with socialized medicine. If the people want taxpayer funded healthcare that’s fine, and if the people don’t want the nanny state making decisions on their behalf that’s also fine. The government is not providing services out of the kindness of their heart, and we don’t owe it to them to reduce our burden on these services in any way. If you want to be healthier, that’s awesome. But if you want to skip vaccines, eat like shit, smoke, drink etc. And you live in an area with taxpayer funded healthcare, you’re not obligated to refuse healthcare to avoid taxing the system. If the government is the only entity allowed to provide healthcare, the way it is in my country Canada, they can’t decide who they refuse care to based on whether or not you received a vaccine. I pay my taxes and I’ll go to the hospital if I need to vaccine or no vaccine.</p>

        <p>To me there’s a difference between the measles vaccine, which was developed in 1963 and has been used in nearly every child in North America with very limited side effects, and a rush job vaccine developed in 6 months for a disease that nobody understands and the government seems entirely too eager to shove down our throats. I’m not totally opposed to the COVID vaccine, but I’m weary of it. We should all be nervous when public health gets a political agenda and then immediately wants to inject the population which god knows what. I just don’t want to be in the first round of people getting it.</p>

        <p>You can look at things with a little more nuance than that. Everyone gets the measles vaccine and have been forever with no side effects. This is a brand new one that they developed too quickly, and seem to eager to give to everyone, and it makes me nervous. I’m not an expert, but I don’t want to be in the first round of people getting the new vaccine, also because I do not believe that Covid is serious. I’m capable of looking at different situations and having different opinions on things without saying “either vaccines are bad or they aren’t.” That’s a little silly. I don’t think vaccines are bad, but I don’t trust this one in particular.</p>

        <p>Absolutely it could be a possibility, and this virus could be the cure we’ve been waiting for, good for everyone and no side effects. But the clinical trials that have been made public have been a lot less than stellar and there’s never been a public health crisis with this much political influence.

        <p>Vaccines vary widely in terms of efficacy and side effects. They are not all the same and mRNA vaccines have never widely been used in humans before and in this case the vaccine was rush developed in only a few months. Vaccines usually take several years, so there is no way I'm going to be a guinea pig and take an experimental product when the drug company has no liability and my likelihood of dying of covid is less than one half of one percent. It's not a risk I consider worth taking, especially when vaccine reactions can cause crippling, lifelong disease.</p>

        <p>It’s very obvious you’re a teenager so I understand you not knowing any better. Blindly trusting the government has been the downfall of many more people than any disease. Death rates for Covid are extremely low and it doesn’t make me a bad person to be skeptical of a vaccine that’s been rushed to develop, and had some extremely troubling side effects in clinical trials. Some people in clinical trials have experienced side effects that are worse than the symptoms most people who contracted Covid experienced. There’s never been a public health event with as much of a political influence as this one, and it’s right to be nervous of that.</p>

        <p>I am honestly tired of typing all of this shit but here I go, if we wouldve continued like normal then many people would've died and a total economic collapse would've ensued, and the fact that these reports of side effects and failures reached you is a reason enough to trust the government as a government that was trying to control you would've never let these reach you, and what do you think the scientists making the vaccine are, superhumans like you, they are humans who try and fail and try again, if you think you have a better shot at making the vaccine, go for it champ</p>

        <p>The modelling that predicted millions of deaths was proven wrong many times. There’s plenty of evidence that lockdowns did not work at all, and the 5 states with the strictest lockdown had the highest death rate. The virus has a higher survival rate than seasonal flu among people that weren’t already sick, or very elderly. It’s clear how much of a political motivation was behind most of the coronavirus response and that makes me skeptical that the vaccine won’t have the same political motivation. Until I know what that motivation is, I won’t be getting the vaccine. Also why are you so hostile? You wouldn’t be speaking like this in real life so why do it on the internet. Learn how to have a conversation, kiddo.</p>
