    <strong>When this system wants you to have the vaccine, do you think it cares about you?</strong>
    <p><p>The same system that starves people to death &amp; the same system that bombs people into pieces is the same system that wants to vaccinate the entire world population. </p>
<p>Do you think the system people care about you? 
Do you think they're pushing vaccines down everyone's throat cause they care about you &amp; your health?</p>
<p>When Tony Blair, a murderous psychopath &amp; a genocidal maniac, is advocating for vaccines, Do you think he's doing that cause he's suddenly compassionate, caring &amp; empathetic? 
Do you seriously trust this pathological liar? </p>
<p>If Bill gates was a real philanthropist, one would think he would provide food &amp; sanitation to the starving people in Africa &amp; India.
But No, All he did was use the poor Indians &amp; Africans as guinea pigs. </p>
<p>Any person who is paying attention knows by now that vaccines are not about health, they're about something else -- something very sinister &amp; malicious. </p>
<p>There always has been an agenda to subjugate, control &amp; cull the population.<br>
Connect the dots yourselves. </p>
<p>(Guys, please copy this post &amp; send it to everyone you know. Try posting this in mainstream subreddits hoping that people might start to think. 
We alone cannot the defeat the "elite" scumbags. 
We must grow in numbers. 
Viva la resistance!)</p></p>
