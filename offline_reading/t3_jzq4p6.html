        <p>I actually see the opposite. I see 'suddenly relevant' scientists trying to dictate polticis. Yesterday, they were nerds studying viruses no one cared about, because they were too shy/bullied to hang out with real people, and books were their only friend. Now, they decide which industry deserves to live, and which industry deserves to die. Fitness industry deserves to die first (nerds want to seem so smart, but they are soooooooooo predictable, of course they want fitness industry to die and videogames to thrive). Of course, nerds want to stay powerful and relevant, and all their 'models', predictably predict that virus will go full savage, and the only hope for the humanity is to listen to what nerds say.</p>
<p>I think it's time for politicians to take back what's theirs. Politicians were not the ones who got the grades. They never studied any viruses-shmiruses, but they know people, they know how people function and what people want. People do not want netflix&amp;chill for eternity.</p>
