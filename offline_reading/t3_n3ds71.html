    <strong>Resistance through transparency</strong>
    <p><p>I want to encourage others to be transparent about their resistance to the NWO/NN! Lying about your vaccination status doesn’t serve anybody! Let’s encourage others to be truthful and stand up for what they believe in. Also, fake vax cards are only pushing us closer to ID2020. Don’t support businesses/organizations that require vax and go a step further by letting them know why they won’t be receiving your resources!</p></p>

        <p>I second this.</p>
<p>People hiding in fear is the main reason we are where we are.  Our opponents win because we sit down and let them make all the noise.  We let people think there are significantly more of them than there are of us.  The less "visible" we are as a group, the easier it becomes to hate the few who <em>are</em> visible, and to single them out for retribution.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that this is one of the most important "dirty little secrets" in sociopolitics.  You want something?  Act like you, and your cause, are facts of life.  It's been working for the "progressives" for decades, and is probably responsible for the majority of their victories.  Now the stakes are much higher.</p>
