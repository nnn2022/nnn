    <strong>You aren't an anti-masker or anti-vaxxer, you are an anti-dictatorship, you're anti-authoritarian, anti-oppression of our freedoms &amp; rights</strong>
    <p><p>The fight for our freedoms is effecting the lives of people that are complicit to the deterioration of our freedoms. These people just want to get on with their lives, many don't see that they are being oppressed from all the illusions the media does with holding up a lie with how we live. People increasingly are being forced to get vaccinated and those that fight for our freedoms are labeled as anti-vaxxers.  Freedom isn't free, we fight for it with our lives, with our wallets, and with our reputation. In this unique time utilizing our freedoms puts others at risk and the general population doesn't care that our freedoms are being taken away and now we see how much they don't care about being oppressed with a giant flashlight.</p>
<p>I'm saddened to learn there are people that understand freedoms are being taken away but choose to be sheep. And use derogatory terms pushed by the media to tell others to get the vaccine and just be oppressed. In the short term the vaccine may save lives now (in theory) but in the long term it may kill more lives as we will be forced to take experimental drugs or vaccines without our consent which is not new to human history.</p>
<p>A person that chooses to be a sheep is far worse than a person that doesn't know they are a sheep. I was once a sheep, a sheep can be taught the truth. Anyone that quits/loses their job for refusing to get vaccinated gets the utmost respect from me. Cause these people are risking their lively hood, risking their paycheck, risking their reputation, risking their status all so we can have our freedoms.</p>
<p>I foresee this pandemic is going to be a long one with many battles, due to the nature of the disease everyone all will be forced to participate.</p></p>

        <p>I never understood the screeching of antivax concerning this. It's an emergency use experimental drug with zero knowledge of long term effects and no knowledge of how it may effect pregnant women. I'm certainly not antivax, but I am anti this vaccine. </p>
<p>When it first came out I had no plans on getting it. I'm 46, zero health problems and I am on zero medications. I was told that I should get it to protect other ppl. Sorry, but I'm not pumping myself full of drugs on the off chance that someone else might get sick. Turns out I was right considering recent news on that subject. Considering the likelihood that I've already had it and didn't even know it that makes it even less necessary. </p>
<p>If you choose to get the vaccine, I am certainly fine with that as well. It's your health decision to make and my opinion only applies to me concerning my own health. I made my decision based on what I felt was right for me and I certainly didn't allow media fear mongering, or political ideology pollute that decision. </p>
<p>As a final note I would like to direct a comment towards the little bitch mod who's using a bot to ban ppl commenting here. You are most likely a perfect example of the type of person you spend your days screeching about. Eat shit and get fucked in any order you prefer.</p>

        <p>Judging by your name, your from canada.</p>
<p>Canada seems like a lost cause from my perspective. I was injured at work and denied medical care, no one cared, no one cares.</p>
<p>The Doctor, WCB, the College of Physicians can all lie and say things like. Freon cant cause irregular heartbeat, you didnt have irregular heartbeat and that my doctor gave me the best care he could even if he is lying about things like not giving me betablockers for complaining about calcium blockers that I was never given. :) OK.</p>
<p>Canada, crown corp of the world maybe?</p>
