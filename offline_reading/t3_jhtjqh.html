    <strong>What's your opinions on COVID19-testing?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm wondering what your opinions on the COVID19-testing is.</p>
<p>I starts getting skeptical to it because of media use the numbers, so it's basically spreading unnecessary much fear, lots of restrictions and lockdowns. If media and politicians didn't push the narrative, and you could just stay at home when you were ill like with the flu it would've been better.</p>
<p>Every single day news says: "New case in X city". No wonder the restrictions never goes over and the COVID19 fears continues. We can't wait forever on a vaccine either. If the numbers were used to say "COVID19 isn't as dangerous. Only a few dies. We can live normally again" I would be more on board with these tests.</p></p>

        <p>The media is pushing it because it is 100% political. They’ve been saying “orange man bad” for 4 years, and now they get to accuse him personally with murder of 200k people, it’s their wet dream. </p>
<p>Cases are inherently misleading. These idiots locked down entire states and cities for weeks or months, then opened up and go “SURGE IN CASES OMG WE NEED TO SHUT DOWN AGAIN” because they’re too stupid to realize their shutdown did not work at all, and that any form of reopening is going to result in more cases. </p>
<p>Look at schools. Some reopened and then closed after 1 day. ONE DAY. Cases “spiked” and then they closed. What the fuck did you think was going to happen? Did you think it magically went away? They decided a week ago to accept the risk of some covid cases and reopen, and then had a panic attack and closed again when the expected outcome occurred.</p>

        <p>I also think it's very politicized. Especially in the US. In other countries the divide between the left and right may not be as big, so it's more a "pro lockdown" and "lockdown skeptical" camp.</p>
<p>I'm not a Trump supporter. Normally I'm a Bernie Sanders supporter. Even I who normally is a far leftist think Trump is right in many things about the lockdown. I don't support the lockdown either. The leftists aren't helping the poor, mentally ill or minorities anymore like they said they wanted to. When Trump, a man who always had his eyes on businesses and the industry, is against lockdown - he will help poor people more.</p>
<p>Many people also were upset when Trump recovered from the virus very fast. If they cares so much about people, why?</p>

        <p>This is something I struggle with...I've seen a lot of people post shit online like "Haha trump got covid whooo" and I'm like, okay, I get that you want the piece of shit to die, but are you also going to be cheering if I die because I dared to go out to parties?</p>

        <p>I personally think people should stop testing. If you feel ill then stay home as you would a cold or a flu or stomach bug. You don't need a test to tell you that you are ill.</p>
<p>Also with the amount of people saying they are ordering tests not swabbing them, sending them back to be told they are positive really makes me think that the testing centers are being told to give numbers every day to reach targets.</p>
<p>I think the governments know these tests are placebos but it gives people a false security. Imagine if they were not testing, people would be going crazy saying the governments aren't testing, they don't care, they have no control over this. But now they have these "positive" numbers they can justify lockdowns and control.</p>

        <p>The PCR tests are garbage, and don't actually test for someone being actively infected and these positive test results are being used as a justification for continuing or increasing lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Don't get tested unless you are sick. Just don't.</p>

        <p>Is there any way at all to get a covid19 test without the results + your personal info going to the government? Like the way you can get a pregnancy test and no one knows the results but you. Healthy person in California US, would like to get a negative test to show to scared pussies to reassure them, but don't want a false positive to turn me into a target for "contact tracing"</p>

        <p>Testing in and of itself is a fine idea, it's good to know how many people are affected by the virus, how fast it's progressing, where we're at. </p>
<p>However the specific implementation of how this is done now leaves some things to be desired.</p>
