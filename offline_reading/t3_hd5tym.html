    <strong>Protest against "new normal" forbidden in my country</strong>
    <p><p>I live in the Netherlands and today there'd be a protest against the new normal. This protest was forbidden while two weeks ago a black lives matter protest was held were 5000 people showed up. Mind you, in the Netherlands there have been no minorities killed by police since the start of this century. It was the most useless protest ever but it was allowed. Nobody was social distancing but racism on the other side of the world is "such an important issue" that it is allowed. </p>
<p>But the issue of people losing their livelyhoods or people (like me) can't go to clinical therapy for which they've waited for years isn't big enough of an issue.</p>
<p>I never thought my country was fascist and I always thought I had more freedom than people have in any other country. Today I stand corrected.</p>
<p>Note: people still went to protest and eventually, it was allowed until 13:30. It's now half an hour later and apparently it's getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Edit: in my country, there was today 1 death because of corona and 3 hospitalizations. These 4 people are the reason thousands have to lose their freedoms.</p></p>

        <p>It's infuriating. The BLM protestors broke all regulations (which didn't even cause an outbreak!) and it's fine, but somehow this is not to be allowed, when we stand to lose so much as a result of this madness. We desperately need a mature, sane debate in society about these measures and what to do if and when a ''second wave'' emerges. I'm sure as hell not in favour of yet another lockdown.</p>
<p>Edit: just yesterday, June 20th, there was a BLM demo at the exact same location which was allowed. Yet somehow the anti-new normal protest was prohibited even though it started out really peacefully, not even that crowded (as it seemed), and only later turned violent with the arrival of rioters.</p>

        <p>If we have learned anything, it is that society in general is incapable of having mature, sane debates. </p>
<p>However, I do have a few pro-lockdown friends who are willing to talk about it rationally. I am anti-lockdown, but there are fair points on both sides and we should be at least be willing to listen, even if we disagree. It is a complicated situation with people actually dying, and many pro-lockdowners are willing to sacrifice their livelihoods in order to save lives.</p>
<p>That sucks that the people in Holland are being fascist, but from an American standpoint your country is seen as a perfect model of socialism. Has the government been taking care of everybody while they couldn't work? Are the laws very strict regarding going out? Is there a game plan for the future of your country?</p>

        <p>The people that couldnt work do get money but there are rules surrounding it that make it difficult for some to receive the money. It's also not as much as they would have made normally, though nobody will have to fear going homeless here like in America. Furthermore, the laws aren't very strict. Right now you only have to wear a mask in busses and trains etc. Most things are open. Except for young people; we can't have parties or festivals, uni won't open &amp; you're not allowed to go to the bar with people you don't live with. You have to stay 1.5 meters apart from them. Since students here often live by themselves that's impossible. For me, the biggest issue is that therapy can't go on as staying 1.5 m apart from people you'll live with and have treatment with 4 days a week. It is impossible. For my friends, the biggest issue seems to be that we can't have parties or can't go out to places with people that aren't our family or our household. And of course, nobody wants to finish their study online. I don't know much about a plan to go back to normal. Our antisocial prime minister seems to be just fine with keeping everyone at 1.5m distance forever.</p>
<p>Btw, We are far from a perfect model of socialism, we are very, very capitalistic. The right has been voted in for at least a decade. Can't remember the last time we had a leftist prime minister. As a crazy libtard (Vegan, feminist etc) Im sorry to disappoint Americans, the only true socialist countries here are the scandinavian ones. </p>
<p>We have the most expansive unis in mainland europe (2000 eu, still a joke to Americans, I know), we are the only ones in the northwest that privatized their hospitals and we are a haven for big international businesses as they can evade taxes in our country easily. We also bombed a Syrian city not too long ago, killing a bunch of children and citizens. We might be seen as socialist as we have had gay marriages since 2002, weed and abortions since forever and it's legal to euthanize, but those things don't really define liberal or republican here. That's more of a "people have basic human rights" thing</p>
<p>TLDR: We are as capitalistic as a "socialist" country can get.</p>

        <p>Very interesting, thanks for explaining this to me. I will tell people about this when they talk about the 'perfect example of socialism' in regard to your country, which is a common belief here.</p>
<p>There is a big push in the USA towards socialism--Bernie Sanders really got this going by pointing out that every other wealthy nation has universal healthcare. But we do not have a good understanding of socialism because that historically has not been the American way of life.</p>

        <p>Because one protest undermines the narrative they are using to impose the coming technocracy,  the  other does not.</p>
<p>Questioning the lockdown leads to questioning the overall narrative behind this virus, and leads to questioning of Gates' claim that our lives can't go back to normal until we ALL have his vaccine. Then it leads to digging, where more people find out that 6 weeks before the first reported case, there was a simulation of a global coronavirus pandemic ran by Johns Hopkins  and the Gates foundation.</p>

        <p>You have no idea how sick I am of this shit, the same in Canada. That's all people here talk about even though a week before the protests started large group of people was harshly criticized for hanging out in the park, but then to go out and protest in thousands is totally fine. I literally hate this world atm.</p>

        <p>I wish I knew.  Here in Canada, it was recently <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/mandatory-vaccination-bill-defeated-new-brunswick-1.5617496">shot down</a>, barely, and they are <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6932834/mandatory-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-ipsos/">pushing</a> it hard. Some are already mandatory in a sense, in order to go to school, etc. I think we need to push for more scrutiny on safety &amp; efficacy (a shred of proof of efficacy and not being unable to sue for damages would be a good start), and the whole "informed consent" thing. At the end of the day it should be decided by the people in a given area and not some billionaire globalist that isn't even a citizen of the places those types of decisions are affecting.</p>
<p>The more people are aware of the issues and speak up and get involved one way or another, the better. We can't just let things slide out of apathy and ignorance. It's not an easy problem, but it's a good reason to learn that one thing you had on the back burner for lack of motivation if it can be leveraged in some way.  At least that's the way i see it</p>

<p>Especially when that billionaire paid for the very studies by Neil Ferguson which caused the lockdowns in the US and UK, only for that billionaire to tell us that our lives won't go back to normal until we are vaccinated to protect us from an outbreak which officially emerged 6 weeks after his foundation and other international bodies simulated precisely such an outbreak.</p>
<p>Also the vaccine is likely to be an RNA vaccine, a new experimental kind of vaccine that has never been used before for a kind of virus for which vaccines have been notoriously difficult to get right. Ask any questions about this vaccine however, and you are a crazy anti-vaxxer.</p>

        <p>This is probably the saddest and most shocking post I've read on this sub since I joined. I'm very very sorry. I've been to the Netherlands many times and as a Jewish person I've always been impressed by Dutch liberal attitudes and lack of racism. So sad to see that the government fits to curb people's freedoms in such a stupid, arbitrary way. Doesn't surprise me when YouTube does it but I'd expect more of the Dutch govt.

        <p>It's so obviously fascism and tyranny spreading around the world. Like, that's really really blatant and I'm not sure how you guys's founding documents are set up, but if you have anything in there vis-a-vis free speech or that bans discrimination based on political affiliation, you should get on that and sue. Assuming your courts are still functioning. Ours are pretty dubious so YMMV</p>

<p>There is an agenda at work here. </p>
<p>One protest undermines the narrative they are using to impose thecoming technocracy,  the other does not.</p>
<p>Questioning the lockdown leads to questioning the overall narrative behind this virus, and leads to questioning of Gates' claim that our lives can't go back to normal until we ALL have his vaccine. Then it leads to digging, whereby more people find out that 6 weeks before the first officially recognised case in Wuhan, there was a simulation of a global coronavirus pandemic ran by Johns Hopkins  and the Gates foundation(EVENT 201).</p>
