    <strong>What the fuck is going on?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I’m not sure if this is how this sub is supposed to be used or if I can post this here, but I am really struggling. I don’t understand how people cannot recognise what is happening. How people can support lockdowns that are so detrimental to everything. Everything. Mental health, people’s livelihoods, child development, loneliness, poverty… I mean it’s really disturbing. I don’t know how to cope with these feelings and I’m the only one around me who thinks this way. My partner is intent on getting the vaccine and I cannot get through to him. I’ve even tried saying to him to just wait, but he won’t. I feel like I’m losing my grip on reality!! Does anyone else feel this way? It’s not as if I can even discuss this with a health professional. It’s insane.</p></p>

        <p>There is a guy called Peter Turchin who is an evolutionary anthropologist who looked into countries which break down and fail or engage in civil wars and he noted the phenomenon of "elite overproduction". </p>
<p>Universities going back to the 19th century it was implicit that their job was to train the next generation of elites and typically the people who went to them were selected because of who their parents were. Then you had this drive towards more meritocracy in the post war era. Now everyone goes to university even though most of the people who go are dull unremarkable midwits who a generation ago would have been a factory worker or maybe an office clerk. </p>
<p>These "false elites" are everywhere, they crave cultural control and influence and recognition of their value even more than they crave wealth. In turn the working classes resent them because they produce nothing of value and turn everything they touch to shit. </p>
<p>For example the Euro 2020 football competition where the players all kneel for BLM - do you think the average "lad" for who football makes up a significant part of their life is going to understand some leftist university graduate dressed like a phaggot trying to explain how white birthing mothers are terrorists and white working class women who drink lattes from Costa contribute to white supremacy?</p>

        <p>It doesn't even take that for their censorship to backfire. I was a moderate centrist when all the censorship started. There is nothing like having some fucking dweeb on reddit decide that you don't get to exist anymore to send a conscious person screaming in the other direction. I am so utterly fucking infuriated by leftist censorship that it in and of itself has taken me from a centrist to a spittle flecked right winged extremist. I bought my first gun last month, for crying out loud.</p>

        <p>That's because the more militant one side of an issue becomes and the more menacing and threatening they become - then an equal and opposite militance must happen as well in response..</p>
<p>I've told people this on many social issues that I have disagreed with them about.. they keep saying "Why are you so intense?" and I respond "I'm responding with equal and opposite intensity in response to how militant you are!".</p>
<p>It's like I've been minding my own business as a white middle-aged male, just going about my business when suddenly I feel like I'm being attacked, or mistreated, or scorned or dealt with harshly..</p>
<p>then you find out "Oh I guess I'm supposed to be  a rapist, bigot, xenophobe, racist, patriarch, privileged, slave-owner, supremacist, misogynist" etc and they're so militant about it,  you have to almost become the opposite to offset it and catch yourself getting into battles you never had to fight before..</p>
<p>And with a particular group making it a Black vs White thing.. they could almost breed hatred and racism in you that wasn't there before, due to their actions, violence and accusations. It's no surprise that Nazis and White Supremacism across the world has started to rise again.. What? They thought they could stomp on us for this long with no lashback?  </p>
<p>Still I try not to get angry or get swept up in the us vs them... but where I have trouble is when I and other's human rights are getting trampled on..</p>
<p>And that's where I can't remain silent and inactive any longer.</p>

        <p>I've tried talking about John Stuart Mill and his views on free speech. They're very well thought out and he was a brilliant man. Most of the kids on reddit don't seem to care though - anything to censor the opposing viewpoint. They probably don't even know who Mill is.</p>

        <p>Stay strong and remember who sat on which side. The entire thing is designed to make normal people seem and feel like the crazy ones. If you haven’t already read 1984 by George Orwell. After that I would suggest Atlas Shrugged. Maybe you’ve already read both, I don’t mean to assume. Stay strong, prepare for worse before it gets better.</p>

        <p>I haven’t been banned from any yet, and now I’m concerned that I’m not speaking loudly enough. On r/trashy today, there was a post that had more to an 4k upvotes about a person that went to the Bahamas that wasn’t vaccinated, and that was somehow trashy?</p>

        <p>I think half the people on most every sub are nutters, just of a different variety. The fact that people are so unconsciously afraid of dissenting opinion that they'd rather shame and censor their way out of having to be exposed to it is the issue I take.   </p>
<p>I don't think the twin towers were an inside job, but I'm fucking happy there are people out there who are passionate/crazy enough to look into it, and I'm happy to live in a country where for the most part they can. Conspiracy theories are just that, theories. The minute we disallow theories no matter how much we disagree with them, is the moment we knock down all remaining barriers that would've prevented bad actors from taking that crazy theory and making it a reality.</p>

<p>Someone on here is collecting and keeps updating a file with articles, studies and data many consider “controversial” information about the masks, vaccines and the virus in general and can help you in defending your position online and offline.</p>
<p>It helped me a lot with debating people:</p>

        <p>I don’t understand how a “critical” conversation of covid consists of only “variants, vaccines”. </p>
<p>Like that’s it… nothing else to consider… or mention, or think about… </p>
<p>I’d rather talk about how this ties into capitalism, economics, poor and rich divide, being critical of government, being critical of the healthcare system, being critical of the pharma corpa, censorship, climate change, nutrition, obesity, lifestyles, addiction, western culture, the sanctity of life, our relationship to society, </p>
<p>Nobody wants to talk about those things cause it makes you take a long hard look at yourself and your relationship in the planet… it can be depressing, full of existential dread, but I’d rather be aware… but I find solace in the view from down here… </p>
<p>At the end of the day I could very well be wrong and led astray… but they’ll never accept this possibility with their narrative… not even for a second… and I find that strange…</p>

        <p>Reddit is an awful place where it only looks like everyone agrees because it's forced. Whenever you think about how terrible and creepy it is, it's because it's essentially a feedback loop where only one type of thought is visible. You eventually feel like absolutely everyone is out of their minds, but it's just that in most places on reddit the people who agree with you aren't allowed to talk, and when they do their words are removed. The futility only ensures less and less people outside of the loop will bother at all.</p>
<p>Most people don't realize how often their posts and comments are removed from public view without their knowledge. Mods remove your comments all the time and more often than not you have no way of knowing unless you log out and try to view it from another account or without being logged in. So whenever you go to a thread and see the ol' reddit [removed] grave yard, there is a closer to one than zero chance that the people who made those comments don't know they were removed.</p>
<p>Fun fact: another comment I made in this very thread was removed in this exact manner. So enjoy the rest of your time on reddit and don't try to think too much about whether or not you're wasting your time when you type out your comments. If you do that, you'll just end up not saying anything at all, and that's exactly what they want.</p>

<p>I mean, as a german I can... tell you this nothing new,  and a repetitive occurance and the style of fascism, because beware of the camps approaching again- we managed to do that actually twice in our history in germany and only the death camps vanished, the rest is still the same here, terrorizing people and punsihing them for WRONG THINK and slowly but accumulating the punishment. My heart weeps not only for my german people for the rest of the world too, because this time you're all in with us too. Big time.</p>

        <p>Welcome! You must be new around here. =)</p>
<p>The answers are all right out there in the open, but you have to make the connections as to what they mean yourself.</p>
<p>You will find an economic crisis happening underneath this, and the virus response provided cover for it. This was global.</p>
<p>You'll discover weird things, like the fact Moderna's vaccine was ready December 12, 2019 before we even knew about Covid-19.</p>
<p>You'll learn about Event 201 and even worse, the SPARS Pandemic Scenario Document which was published in 2017 which was planning and setup for what is happening now.</p>
<p>Oh there's so much to unpack. It's dark. And it's real.</p>
<p>It's looking like the virus itself was, indeed, manufactured... But it wasn't the threat. The real threat appears to be the vaccines themselves.</p>
<p>Let me be clear -- most of us here are NOT "antivaxxers" although we are skeptical of injecting experimental mRNA gene therapy in our bodies...</p>
<p>Particularly since it's been proven that they hid known treatments for Covid-19 in order to get emergency use authorization for the vaccines.</p>
<p>Also, government partnered with Big Tech in order to sidestep the law and enact systemwide censorship.</p>
<p>Doctors, scientists, medical workers all over the world are being silenced and getting fired if they speak out.</p>
<p>If you really want to know what's going on - it's a bit like swallowing the red pill in The Matrix.</p>
<p>Here's a timeline. Read through. Check out the links. </p>
<p>The starter-links there at the very bottom are a good way to ease into this stuff. Sorry for the hard to read format, but the information is there.</p>
<p>You have to cast a wide net in order to find connections between the fish, so not EVERYTHING in there is necessarily connected. Some are coincidences, some tie together... Like the World Bank issuing pandemic bonds followed by partnership with WHO to declare a pandemic --- complete with 5 governors ordering sick patients into nursing homes in order to get the death count high enough to do so!</p>
<p>What's happening almost unbelievable except -- it's real, and it's unfolding right before our eyes. But before you get too skeptical -- just think of some of the rather insane events in history. We are just living through one, right now:</p>

        <p>Moral bioenhancement is the idea of "using biomedical technology to morally improve individuals."</p>
<p>But it's a wide net. For example, if you believe that the world is overpopulated and there will be greater suffering as a result -- then reducing fertility in your citizenry is morally justified.</p>
<p>It can also mean to use biomedical technology to make people more passive, less aggressive, more generous, less 'devoted to a cause' etc.</p>
<p>Parker Crutchfield argues in favor of <strong>covert</strong> bioenhancement. What he advocates is --- if something is justifiably morally, then it is best handled covertly. Hidden.</p>
<p>What he's really saying is it's a good thing to hide things in our vaccines that will reduce lifespan and reduce fertility for the "greater good" of reducing overpopulation.</p>
<p>He's just arguing the point more broadly so as to avoid specifics, and so it can be used for any morally justifiably issue.</p>
<p>Parker Crutchfield's argument is insane, of course, but it's useful for cooperation between Big Pharma and government, particularly in regard to the population reduction aspects of The Great Reset.</p>

        <p>I think the focus is more on neurological modification of people than life length or fertility. This is clearly immoral to me. First of all giving someone something without informed consent is unethical, thus immoral. Secondly, those power hungry immoral sociopaths are the ones to whom decision making positions are magnetically attractive, hence it's people who are immoral who'll use "Moral" BioEnhancement. No need to be a rocket scientist to see the paradox here.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I agree with you. Another way to view Parker Cruthfield's point is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ends justify the means</li>
<li>The collective is more important than the individual</li>
</ol>
<p>However, this sets up a situation where the ruling class -- whether it's the wealthy in a capitalist system or the planners in an authoritarian government system -- can do terrible things under the guise of collective morality.</p>
<p>I also think you're right that there is intention to manipulate people neurologically... BUT don't underestimate their interest in life length / fertility. That's not "conspiracy theory", it's very real.</p>
<p>Take a look at:</p>
<p>National Security Study Memorandum NSSM 200 (Henry Kissinger 1975, declassified in 1989) related to World Population Plan of Action (covert education of public on benefits of not having children, sterility injections, etc.)</p>
<p><a href="https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf">https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf</a></p>
<p>That was their plan. They did it, and it worked. It pushed population growth estimates back by 20 years!</p>
<p>It also touches on a worrisome view that many "believe the situation is dire enough that we need to take actions that would have been considered morally objectionable."</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we are NOW hitting the population level they are trying to avoid, so this would suggest that that type of person is more ready to take "morally objectionable" actions now in regard to population control than ever before.</p>
<p>I do think things will be handled indirectly, for the most part. Consider how our food industry has made the majority of Americans obese. This reduces lifespan significantly. It's a win-win for their class because it ends peoples lives by the time they aren't productive anymore, they can profit on selling them garbage "food", and then they profit on their sickness as they die. "Perfect."</p>
<p>I have no doubt there's something to the Covid-19 vaccines though. I don't know what, yet... But the lies, the coverups, the obsession with vaccinating children who aren't affected at all by Covid-19. None of it makes any sense on the surface. Then there's the systemwide censorship where we're barely able to talk about it.</p>
<p>So... They're hiding something.</p>
<p>I think there is a long term plan for the injections to become normalized and will eventually directly control population. Sterility injections are mentioned in Kissinger's document.</p>
<p>For now? I think a percentage of people who get the vaccines are going to die and another percentage of them are going to have severe (and profitable) health issues later.</p>
<p>After all, these people appreciate depopulation in small amounts...</p>
<p>You can look in Kissinger's document where he says the role of abortion in worldwide population reduction must be appreciated...</p>
<p>These people don't think like we do. They are the class that matters, and at best they think of us as cattle. At worst they think of us as insects.</p>

        <p>I think it was George Orwell who said something along the lines of "In a world full of lies, the truth will sound insane." </p>
<p>Our world is full of lies. Society is too far down the path of "covid will kill is all" and everyone is too embarrassed to admit they exaggerated the problem. I've lost friends over this very issue, and I choose not to play the game anymore. When someone asks me about something covid related I am brutally honest about my opinion and I no longer give a fuck what they think about me.</p>

        <p>I'm wondering if they pushed it too far with the "Delta variant" line. That's just so obviously fearmongering that you'd have to be pretty deep into the cult not to see it. </p>
<p>I mean, in the beginning last year, people, relatives were actually dying. (There's a discussion to be had about the exact cause, but well, they were no less dead). Now, the death rates are touching zero, and in fact, we might see negative excess death rates the last half of this year.</p>
<p>The governments have been crying wolf for more than a year. People don't care any more.</p>

        <p>I’d bet money that we’re back below trend line on deaths for 2021. We (Global leaders) killed a few 100k more last year for the power grab, and this year, with all the high risk elderly and overweight people gone, we’ll revert to the mean - not excess deaths, insufficient deaths, and we certainly can’t point that out without seeming “cold and heartless,” as if acknowledging the universality of death is any such thing.</p>
<p>u/ploobi, you’re not alone, I’d bet you’re part of the silent majority, like the rest of us, cowed into silence because fear always beats love where strangers are involved. No one here celebrates death. But, we know the disease was manufactured, and whether it was intentionally or accidentally released is a distinction without a difference in the conversation where manufactured diseases even exist at all.</p>
<p>I wish you the best in finding like-minded people where you are. I haven’t done so well where I am, but I tend to keep to myself. Some of these people are too far gone, but many are waking up.</p>

        <p>I glad you found it too. But I’m also sorry for all of the time you spent on that uncomfortable island of silence where folks get sent when we have questions and concerns. A few months ago I was in the pits of depression from the ostracism and forced isolation. Any attempt to talk to my loved ones about it only furthered my feelings of being crazy and alone in my perspective. Point is, I don’t even remember how I found NNN, but god I’m happy I did. I was happily relieved to learn there were other humanity loving people who felt the same way I did. </p>
<p>Most folks are surprised to find that most of us here in NNN are not anti-mask, or anti-vaccine, we simply want our rights to bodily autonomy respected. Oh, and for our elected officials to stop treating us like children, and allow us to resume life as the decent hearted, safe and respectful community members that most of us are. We don’t require boots on our necks to do what is best, which is why I’m disappointed as fuck in how many of my anti-establishment loved ones have started to encourage, enjoy and partake in the boot stepping.</p>

I get straight up ostracized for being "anti-vax" and almost everyone I know got it Most that are in my age-range believe anything they see on instagram and will try to copy the trends to gain likes and validation. My feeds nonstop bombarded with pro vaccine articles or people taking pictures of them being vaccinated/ flexing their vaccine card.</p>

        <p>The same FDA that’s now adding warnings for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines advising that they can lead to heart inflammation, and then turning around and saying “but we still suggest that 12-18 year olds who are at zero risk from Covid take this shot which may cause serious cardiovascular side effects”? </p>
<p>Yeah, I couldn’t care less what the FDA approves or doesn’t approve now. All credibility is out the window.</p>

        <p>Yes but kinda no. There are quite a few good things they disapprove as well, though I highly doubt this is one of them. I've always generally been more suspicious of injected pharmaceuticals for what I'd like to think are understandable reasons: the needle itself potentially resulting in lasting tissue damage, the immediate entry of whatever substance into the bloodstream, the lessened ability to remove the substance from the body or reverse any effects, and the frequent use in cases of noncompliance or potential noncompliance where pills could be more easily refused. Nevermind the big bads of governments and corporations around the world, I reckon an asshole nurse would have an easier time injecting you with shitwater than getting you to drink it. Or at least you wouldn't be able to vomit it up. Fuck being afraid of needles, be suspicious at the very least of who and what is on the other end of the needle. Any mistake or "mistake" could become systemic in seconds rather than minutes. If you're lucky, it won't rear its head until you're old and almost dead anyway.</p>

        <p>What's happening really is quite tragic. My girlfriend got both doses of the vaccine. Just came home from work one day and told me she got it. I was devastated. It's definitely having an impact on her now. She's had 3 periods this month.</p>
<p>We are being psychologically attacked by our governments and media corporations. Some people notice it and resist (us). Some people ignore it. Some people cope by just following along mindlessly and letting the television do the thinking for them. I don't this makes people particularly evil. Irresponsible, yes, but I doubt many are acting this way out of malice. They're just afraid, and want it to stop like we do.</p>

        <p>No he didn’t and I didn’t know either, he got it early and out of the blue; neither of us were paying much attention to it and we were in different countries at the time he got it, I started looking into it and all hell broke loose- I just couldn’t be with him anymore after that. Luckily we didn’t have sex after he got it because I was in a different country at the time. 
I do care about him, but I wasn’t that happy in the relationship tbh, he was getting really controlling so it probably would’ve ended soon anyway- the vax was the  final straw</p>

        <p>It's not just you. This is undoubtable the greatest mass hysteria event in history. It's no measure of health to be well adjusted to a sick society. </p>
<p>Some days, I know it can feel like things will never get better and that we've already lost. But you gotta hang in there.  Humanity has made it this far, and in the end, the truth always prevails. I won't lie, things may get worse for a while, but there's always a light at the end of the tunnel. You can already see some of the cracks in the narrative starting to form, and people are noticing. </p>
<p>London just had possibly the largest protest in the country's history, and I/m not sure where you live, but people will wake up. I live in Ontario, one of the most brainwashed places on earth, and slowly, people around me are starting to wake u. My parents, who were extremely pro lockdown and pro mask this entire time, after talking to them and explaining my reasoning are now coming around and understand why I won't get the jab. So don't despair, there are definitely plenty of people who are just silently going along even though they don't agree with all this. If you talk to these people, they may get the courage to start speaking up too, knowing they aren't so alone. </p>
<p>Until then, we'll be a little support group to help keep each other sane in these insane times. Never give up on your convictions, because that's when you've truly lost your grip on reality.</p>

        <p>What are you, a science-denying cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIsT? Just kidding, but yes, that’s the common response nowadays when one dares to question any part of the mainstream media narratives.</p>
<p>We live in crazy mixed up times, where saying “all races are equal” is somehow racist, and healthy people breathing fresh air are trying to murder grandmothers living on the other side of the planet. </p>
<p>I’m enraged that my 3 year old daughter has to wear a cloth mask at preschool 5 hours per day, even playing outside, but I have to work and don’t have alternative childcare or financial options. I’ve taught her to at least take the mask down as often as she can, until she’s inevitably told to cover her mouth again. It makes me fucking enraged. Borderline child abuse.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is a goddamn hell hole. We actually tried to move to Canada last January; but of course everything then locked down up there as well. Orwellian nightmare. Shows our Constitutional rights don’t mean shit.</p>

        <p>Please understand that I am not judging you, but I have to ask.</p>
<p>Why are you still in California???</p>
<p>The only educated guess I can make that you would want to move from California to Canada is that you are part of Hollyweird, and you think that going from Hollywood to Vancouver or Toronto will be better. Word of mouth is, it isn't.</p>
<p>Or you have family of one type or another.</p>
<p>(Please feel free to not response to the above statements if you wish. I'm fully aware that the comment could be considered prying, and "Fuck off" is a totally valid answer)</p>
<p>If the two statements above do not apply then please consider moving to anywhere in between the costal states. If you haven't been there yourself you cannot trust what you think you know about them.</p>
<p>In a perfect world I'd return to Cali in a heartbeat, but these days (even prior to COVID) short of a contract in Hollyweird (both my grandfathers was part of that world, and they both called it that) I won't set foot there unless I'm being a tourist.</p>

        <p>Why the fuck would anyone want to move to Canada? This country is a neoliberal shithole and worse than any state in the USA by far. </p>
<p>Everyone is pissed off all the time about housing and even our ~ free healthcare ~ sucks now because all hospitals are overburdened by our aging population (homegrown and imported). Our college/uni degrees are meaningless and lead to low security, min. wage jobs.</p>
<p>If you somehow manage to succeed in spite of the low employment and policies meant to crush entrepreneurship,  they will take half your income in taxes. You'll rent and pay twice the mortgage for a wealthy boomer/immigrant's basement. The children you should have had will be replaced by 400,000 foreigners per year and you will be called a racist xenophobe if you point out there is no infrastructure to support them. </p>
<p>I live in an opiate addicted city where you can't leave your locked car outside for 5 minutes without it getting broken into and they're charging $1600-3500 to rent a basement, crack apartment or half a house (living above or below drug addicts, depending on which floor you get). </p>
<p>Canada has the worst to offer of all G7 countries, don't come here.</p>

        <p>Thank you for answering.</p>
<p>In this case it is more of a "Leap of faith" than anything else, and I totally understand how risky it can be.</p>
<p>The only "simple" options is to either find a job out of your field, then interview for something in your field once there... Simple but not easy.</p>
<p>For myself, and especially when I was single, I was transient. When I got bored I moved to a new town. In my case I played jack-of-all-trades, but I have a background in computers and I'm fluent in three languages so I could always find one job or another.</p>

        <p>Then you would be right at home. ND and SD have basically been back to normal since last may. My life has hardly changed. You can go where you want, whenever you want, people are 99% maskless if they were doing it at all. Bars, concerts, restaurants. You name it.</p>

        <p>That sounds fantastic. Glad you are enjoying your freedom. I’m definitely more of a small town guy, but I work in television (sportscaster), so have to go where the gigs take me to support my family. Peace</p>

        <p>If you read the articles of the world economic forum it's pretty apparent that these people genuinely think they're saving the world. They believe in a sort of new aristocracy in which the elite know what's best for us and we all live a life they've predetermined for us. Because naturally, the world would be perfect if it wasn't for all that pesky freedom we have.</p>

        <p>Too many people think that if they just comply then everything will get back to normal. I think more and more people are starting to realize that politicians will never stop shifting the goalposts. Anyone who still thinks that we would’ve eradicated COVID by strictly adhering to lockdowns last year is beyond delusional at this point.</p>

        <p>I came here to agree. What super unfortunate for OP is that their partner isn’t on the same boat, and that is adding extra layers of feeling crazy,  isolated, and likely more fearful. Making one’s own reality is a nice idea until we realize how many loved ones won’t be part of it.</p>

        <p>I’ve cut news out of my life almost 98% and it’s amazing, cut out Facebook too. The only political videos I watch are Rand Paul grilling Fauci or Sleepy Joe compilations. All of the “news” I need in my life comes from a select few subs. It’s honesty amazing how consumed and unaware people are nowadays. I ask the same thing “just howwww do you not see the bigger picture here?” Then they rebuttal with some joke about 5G or microchips like they think it’s funny. Little do they know…</p>

        <p>I'll let you in on a little secret. The hardest things for most people to do is to admit they've been fooled. It is easier to believe totally made up bullshit that puts your own health at risk for most people than it is to admit you've been tricked. Myocarditus hurts less for most people than public embarassment because heart inflammation happens in private.</p>

        <p>For real though. I know this can’t be the entire driving motivation behind the stubborn refusal to acknowledge facts, but I can’t help but think it’s playing a large role. Some people are strangely enjoying this new kind of life, and that in itself offers us a scary demonstration of where humanity is thanks to the tech revolution.

        <p>I would do it if I could. The problem is that the PMC class forced the working class to wear mask 8-12 hours a day and destroyed our society and economy with lockdowns so they could work from home.

        <p>I'm glad you posted this.  It's to the point where I am losing some friends because of this.  I present facts and information while they look down on me and speak in a condescending manner like I don't know what I'm talking about.  It usually ends with them throwing a temper tantrum of some sort and them trying to make me feel like I'm being selfish for not getting the jab or supporting lockdowns.  Effing cLoWn WoRld!!!!!  </p>

        <p>Exactly.  2 of my coworkers were hospitalized 1-2 weeks after receiving the jab (one had a heart attack and the other has fluid around his liver), a lady that works at a local store had a reaction and her face swelled up for about a week, and my sister had a miscarriage 1 week after her 2nd jab.  I'm not saying definitively that the jab was the cause, because I am no doctor, but it is enough to make your raise your eyebrow. </p>

        <p>I saw that! 
It’s just so weird, people are getting tremors, paralyzed and they’re still rooting for the vax smh
I saw one post where this girl was asking for help because her brother was one of the people that got the tremors from the vax, and she’s upset because he’s anti vax now and she thinks he’s been radicalized.
I was thinking, someone here is radicalized and it’s not him, his life is ruined because of this needless injection and she is upset that he’s saying bad things about vax- she’s the radicalized one…

        <p>Sounds like you’re letting the gaslighting get under your skin. This was happening to me, as most of my friends (including the ones I’m living with next year, fucking F) think I’m a crazy tin foil hat wearing Qanon conspiracy theorist.... for seeing what’s right in front of me.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t think so many people rely on mainstream consensus to think a certain way. Especially my friends who tend to disagree with mainstream media. That’s the most frustrating part.</p>
<p>My advice is to say fuck the gaslighting. You know what’s true, along with SO many people in the world. </p>
<p>Also, I felt so frustrated continually thinking: “okay... NOW it’s undeniably obvious... NOW everyone should be able to perfectly see it!!!” I had the realization that <strong>just because it’s getting more obvious to me, doesn’t mean the truth is any more visible to those who don’t want to see it.</strong></p>

        <p><em>How people can support lockdowns that are so detrimental to everything.?</em></p>
<p>Because they can afford to.Now ask yourself, how can they afford to?</p>
<p>That will answer your question, and why this whole stupid thing has gone on for so long, without any massive protests and uprising.</p>
<p>I had the same confusion and bewilderment for a time, as I was greatly concerned about the state of my own business, loss of income and opportunities, draining savings account, not entirely destroyed income but massively diminished.. and wondering why the people around me didn't even care or appeared worried at all...</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I relate to this a lot. I had a big cry about it all today, some days it really gets to me. Lost friends over it all, just for having a different opinion. I haven't even been that vocal about the vaccines, I've more been vocal about lockdown and how I disagree with them. But people can't handle the fact that we have a different opinion. Isn't it maddening? It's essentially prison. But we have words like 'lockdown' to make it sound like it's something different. It's fucking not.</p>
<p>If you ever want to have a chat feel free to DM me. Whereabout do you live, are you able to find likeminded people in your area? I went to a Freedom march on Saturday in London (anti-lockdown etc) and there were about 2 million of us there. Really confirmed to me that there are more of us than we realise.</p>

        <p>I see you and I hear you, I feel exactly the same way and I'm so sorry you're going through this.</p>
<p>I'm based in Ireland and our prime minister came out yesterday and told us two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nobody can avail of indoor dining, leaving Ireland the only country in Europe that doesn't allow people to eat inside a restaurant/still under the most conservative restrictions (some pubs haven't been allowed to open their doors since March 2020!!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When indoor hospitality opens, it will be only for the vaccinated and they are now putting a system in place for this. I am shocked, disgusted and devastated that out of nowhere this is thrown at us. My mental health is deteriorating as this continues on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I genuinely don't know what to do, I feel like if I didn't have a son (who I love more than anything), I wouldn't want to be here at all anymore.</p>

        <p>Fuck your partner. They're gonna be shedding spike proteins all over your ass after they get the jab. Just kidding. But I do agree. I never in my life thought people would be running out with zero research and getting an experimental vaccine. Especially after watching exactly ZERO of their friends or family die. Apparently we've been lucky here or it's just not what they wanted to convince us it is. My mother in law regretted getting hers after we told her why we weren't. It's fuckin' bizzarroworld.</p>

⁣
Choose your battles wisely. This applies to battles of words and opinions as much as to  physical confrontations. ⁣
⁣
Don't engage in battles in which you are grossly outnumbered and your time and energy will only provide fuel for the hatred and self-righteousness of the brainwashed. ⁣
⁣
The covid crowd has been fully indoctrinated and brought under the heel of authoritarian control. ⁣
⁣
The same pattern repeats itself throughout history. ⁣
⁣
The similarities between the covid group and the followers of Mao's communist party are uncanny.⁣
⁣
With regards to your partner. The two of you are miles apart. ⁣
⁣
You believe in self-autonomy and trust in yourself.  You question and don't blindly accept authoritarian control. You refuse to be used as fodder to satiate the greed of others. These are fundamental values upon which you have built your life. ⁣

Your partner is of a different breed than you.</p>

It’s not safe if I’m not vaccinated! WTF? I’ve been shunned from many things because I don’t want the jab. It’s so fucked up. 
Maybe we should share what location we are at and make new connections with like minded people!</p>

        <p>I was going to make a thread about this but I didn't want to trigger anyone, but since you made this thread and I find it useful, I need to express myself. I'm having very weird feelings. I will say it in a spoiler, so that those who can be easily triggered can spare being triggered. </p>
<p>&rt;!I have borderline suicidal ideation (no plans, no guts) at times from the prospect of this society seemingly becoming more "totalitarian" in terms of vaccines and possible vaccine passports. This is reminding me of the mark of the beast that scripture prophesies about. I am always worried that I don't want to be the one who takes that mark. Mind you I don't believe that the vaccine is the mark but it's reminding me of what it will be like, but the mark will be even worse. I can't find enjoyment in life anymore, I am on meds and I don't think they're working as well, and I do have severe PMS without them, so maybe I just need to raise my dose, but I still wonder if I would have a tinge of that ideation without all that. !&lt;</p>

        <p>Many of us think it is the mark of the beast. It doesn't mean you are crazy. I even deconverted from fundamentalist Christianity and think it is the mark of the beast and believe God/Source told me not to take it. Listen to your intuition. I know they are going to label everyone crazy who doesn't obey the program. Being depressed in a sick dystopian society probably is more normal. Hope you feel better soon.</p>

        <p>My gut tells me that it's imperative to be around Christians at this time, but only the actual serious ones who do not buy into the Covid Gospel. But I don't have a Church. I'm scared to go to Church because I have such social anxiety that I don't believe I can make friends and that anyone could love me more than my parents. There are a lot of fakes in Church too. Maybe most of them. But I feel that if I don't do this eventually, it will be impossible for me to survive when the real Mark comes (as creepy as the Covid vaccine situation is, I don't quite believe it's the Mark because it's not on our foreheads or right hand and we're not being threatened with actual death for not taking it).</p>

        <p>Understand. I do think the meaning of forehead and right hand, is more complex than discussed, see RevelationsofJesusChrist.com where he goes to the greek/hebrew in the bible. When I was fundamentalist I learned and studied the bible that way looking up the  original languages. right hand is a word that can mean "right side" simply by the Greek. Forehead can be a reference to the brain.  You will see. I think it could fit the bill but just something to think on. I am in a very liberal church and can't talk to them about this. Most took it. I find myself wishing I knew some NWO aware Christians to talk to but they simply don't exist around here. Most of the Christians I know {lutherans and mainstream evangelicals around here} got the vaxx. There's a lot of fakes yes and I faced severe spiritual abuse in the fundamentalist circles, so I understand your wariness. It's why I left the fundamentalist world. It is sad we have to feel so alone. I don't get that at all. I wonder why everyone I know who sees through all this lives thousands of miles away and why don't I know one person even who does?</p>

<p>Taking the mark of the beast out of it (although I totally respect your viewpoint) I’m very scared of medical tyranny. I don’t know where things with this world are headed but it really doesn’t look good or like somewhere I’d want to live in. You’re not alone.</p>

        <p>No need to rush it, no one exits this world alive. Remember that they can take your body but it's up to you if you let them break your mind or not. Flip the suicidal ideas into pure defiance of the covid cult, until the bitter end (hopefully it won't get to that point). I do agree that it's either the mark or the step leading up to it, and this is coming from someone who didn't believe in anything until recently. I played around with demonic forces in my life and I got....well... demonic forces (big surprise /s).</p>

        <p>If that makes you feel any better, these are either MISERABLE people who “thrive” during lockdowns or Chinese Cubicle Workers who push certain agendas on Social Media to social-engineer people who are in the middle about the subject.

        <p>Unfortunately, some people are SO swayed by the media. If Mr. News Man tells them lockdowns are good, get the vaccine, be a good little boy - then they feel like they MUST do that stuff. I'll be honest, I used to follow the media, believe everything, and not question anything. I met my now fiance, and he really opened up my eyes to how fake media is. He used to work for a local TV station and he saw first-hand the kind of bullshit is out there. You can try our best to convince your partner, but if Mr. Media is telling him otherwise, he may not listen.</p>

The same people pressuring us and trying to make us feel bad are the same ones that have been ranting about the importance of mental health.. be nice to everyone they used to say.. except those antivax conspiracy scum now 🙄 </p>

        <p>This is what high school history class taught us and we're living through the question of "if you were in pre WW2 Nazi Germany, would you have fallen for the propaganda and gone along with it?"</p>
<p>In my country they're breaching the Nuremberg Code by making experimental injections mandatory for aged care workers. They know the extremely high recovery rate.  They know transmission happens afterward.  They're still forcing it.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do.  Germans were convinced of a plague of people that did not exist.  Now the world has been convinced something akin to a common cold is a reason for constant news reports, lockdowns, curfews, travel bubbles, check-ins, mass demoralisation and experimental pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>People tear up flyers with facts from government websites that go against the fear porn agenda.  Websites and links to medical studies with simple common knowledge about being healthy increasing the already high survival rate, get frowned upon and ignored.</p>
<p>If they're not getting it by now, they might never.  They'll watch a football game where guys climb all over each other for hours, at the end they can't shake hands, not COVID-Safe - <em>blank stare.</em></p>
<p>A virus so deadly that walking outside in the fresh air without a mask is an arrestable offence because everyone is put at risk.  The mask is needed to enter a venue where you can sit, drink, eat and laugh without one for hours risk free - <em>makes sense, I love science!</em></p>
<p>These people are waiting on the 6 o'clock news to tell them what to think, 5 minutes at a time.  They're not going to question compliance and be the reason things go back to how they were before.  Even though they could.</p>
<p>There's YEARS of billion dollar programming, marketing and social engineering that has got them to this point.  It doesn't matter about facts or logic, it only matters that what they're told suits their programming.  I really don't know how to break that if they can't take the first step.</p>

        <p>Sorry, what I read was written from the shopowner's perspective and didn't mention the guy's reaction at all, from what I recall.</p>
<p>In other news, I came back to find this innocent comment bought me 5 bans from subs I barely remember subscribing to anyway, lol. I thought the bans came if the content of your comments was considered bad by the mainstream standards; if it's just simple engagement, isn't it easier to ban you as soon as you subscribe here?</p>

        <p>I am disturbed too just like you. I spent some time on an art project today but was telling husband something is really wrong and all of this is going to crash. I have no one to talk to either except online and husband. To be honest if my spouse told me he was getting the vaccine, I would threaten divorce. I don't want to die from spike proteins shedding. I would tell him sex would be off the table permanently. You should go that far. Save him from himself. I believe it's a "mark of the beast" [spiritually evil, even in the guises of other religions]. I have made sure to tell husband these beliefs. For me it IS a deal breaker. </p>
<p>Even if you take the spiritual out of it, the submission to the system even unto death and destruction is a deal breaker for me. Make this clear to your spouse. If I was single today, I would refuse to date any Covid vaxx man. [I am fine with traditional vaccines] Tough to all who read this and feel offended but it's how I feel. I am childless due to illness and old but if I was woman who wanted kids, hell no doubly to any Covid Vaxxinated men.</p>

        <p>It's social ingeneering at its finest: the fear of death, lack of knowledge, constant changing of the goalpost, peer pressure, the need to show values, blind obedience, personnality cult and propaganda saviors, the state support from the media, the dogma of paid science, etc.</p>
<p>There is a reason why the government founded so much behavioral studies and while we think it's something recent, we fail to see it's been on its way for over 2 decades</p>

        <p>85% of the population is very easy to manipulate. They have no constitution or mental strength. That's why whenever there's a real change or revolution, it's always a small group that make changes. And guess what, when those changes are made, the collective idiot populous accepts it. That's why people need someone else to take care of them because they're way too stupid to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>Everything people consume is toxic. The food, the water, the air, the information, TV, movies, books. Everything is in the hands of a small group of people and corporations that think they know what's best and because they have an audience and what appears to be higher knowledge, they are obeyed. </p>
<p>People don't read for themselves they don't make up their own minds or think things through or analyze. They react emotionally to emotionally charged propaganda and are useful idiots for the state and their corporate sponsors.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where the corporations mandate advertising through the government and force their untested product on the population because billions of dollars who cares about the environment or people or animals. MONEY</p>
<p>They just turned Canada into a communist state with fully integrated MSM tied to the state and no elections. And all they had to do was scare people about THE COMMON COLD</p>

        <p>It's amazing to me that people haven't picked up on the manipulation yet. I guess it's because they aren't trained to recognize the pattern. </p>
<ol>
<li>Create confusion </li>
<li>Foment fear and thus panic that there are no answers</li>
<li>Dangle hope </li>
<li>Tell them only you have the answers but you have to obey.</li>
</ol>
<p>I work in clinical trials.  I can tell you with certainly that the Nuremberg codes were shit on and the FDA has broken the law on EUA's because there ARE safer drugs available that work. Those at the CDC and the FDA should be imprisoned for life. If someone tried to jab me with that shit, without a single longitudinal study on safety, I would go Vlad The Impaler on them.</p>

        <p>YouTubeand social media censorship is fucking weird. Meanwhile they are making sadist TV shows and movies. Remember when movies were about the good guy? Now it's about sympathizing with the villian. So all this new social engineering means what exactly? Become a narcissistic sadist and if anyone speaks out they are terrorists and bigots?</p>

        <p>You are not alone. </p>
<p>MOST people are in a state of denial; they cannot fathom the government committing such crimes against their own citizens and humanity in general.  Their belief system and logic dictates to them, “There is no way they would do this without just cause; someone would blow the whistle!”</p>
<p>But when/if someone speaks the truth, they are labelled a “conspiracy theorist”. </p>
<p>This WILL take a very, very dark turn. </p>
<p>You must decide for yourself what your own limits are and plan a strategy to survive.  You may lose friends family and loved ones, but it’s a sacrifice you will have to make if you want to live a life of freedom without totalitarian rule.</p>

        <p>It's a psychological war. You are NOT alone. When all of our institutions have been infiltrated by bad actors and controlling the messaging (media, medicine, big tech, education, government) only those who have the intellectual and intuitive strength to trust their guts are able to step outside the propaganda. We're living in a repeat of Nazi Germany. Think back to when you learned about the Nazis... didn't you always wonder HOW any of the German people could have gotten behind a movement so heinous and obscene?</p>

        <p>How long have you been with your partner? Has he always been so trusting of governments/corporations, or is it a new development that seems out of character for him? If the latter, when did it start? November 2019? March 2020? Just this year? Does he get sick a lot? Hit really hard when he gets sick?</p>
<p>I don't wanna be one of those "kick 'em to the curb" types when I don't know either of you, but it just absolutely baffles me how so many couples have been together for 5+ years yet aren't on the same page about such a major issue. When my husband and I first met, we spread our core values - spiritual, philosophical, political, economic, ecological, biomedical - all out on the table for each other to see before ever exchanging names. Any disagreement we have - including the COVID topic - is basically just a personality clash. Husband is a sweetheart who puts his foot down and raises his voice only when he really feels it necessary, so people really listen when it happens. I'm like Frank Castle trapped in a little girl body. Would you watch Punisher if the protagonist was too small and booby for her fist to reach the average face? No, maybe not.</p>
<p>Anyway, welcome! :)</p>

        <p>I somewhat agree, though it doesnt change the nature of their Position. They are now considered Authority. So their word hold higher value in society in any regard. I wonder when exactly the activist part of the left/the democrats has turned to following every point the authorities make, instead of "rebelling" against them like activist did in the long past.</p>
<p>The people Who are supposed to go against the opinion of the authorities are now the somewhat-enforcers of their will.</p>

        <p>In my opinion these people are getting constant confirmation bias from everywhere they look. I find it real easy to get certain information but if I want the other sides story (this sub for example), I have to go out of my way for it. A lot of people aren’t willing to do that. Tons of censorship but they don’t care because it’s not on their side, which only helps their confirmation bias. </p>
<p>On one hand I view these people as victims, because we should be able to trust our institutions. But on the other hand I can’t view them as such because the information is available to them. </p>
<p>I feel like I’m living in clown world and I’m surrounded by clowns. I don’t understand it either. I’m just trying to stay positive.</p>

        <p>Completely agree with your sentiment, everything hit me the other night when I started thinking about the long term implications and economic damage that has been done. I don't understand how we can possibly even come back from this now. I just do not understand for the life of me how short-sighted and ignorant people seem to be these days. I am also struggling to cope, i don't quite know whether or not you can relate with this, but it really feels as if our collective foundation is crumbling. I have a young daughter and it absolutely kills me when I think about her future. To make matters worse, her highschool have started shoving all the CRT down her throat. Luckily, their arguments are easy to dismiss but still, it's like an attack on every level.</p>

        <p>Hello, dear.</p>
<p>&rt;I’ve even tried saying to him to just wait, but he won’t.</p>
<p>we all know here what you think and feel right now. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I hope everything goes right if he really is going to get the shot. We don't know about the longterm effects, and the risk of side effects is not slim. As he doesn't seem to be willing to give up on that, and you already tried to talk to him, you can only hope for the best. Focus on reality and what outcome would be the best. Yes, this and that could happen. But as I said, focus on the best outcome in your thoughts if you can't change him. </p>
<p>If he doesn't listen to your concerns and MAY BE also risking the health of possible future children -because some vaccines change your DNA?!- you also might reconsider your future plans with him, but leaving him is probably just too horrible to think about, I know, so it's really nothing I want to suggest to you. And it's also a part of their big plan- to divide us further.</p>
<p>Please feel hugged. </p>
<p>That's all I can do for you, sadly. Maybe it helps to focus on the good things (because thoughts are spells too...), and maybe carefully rethinking things. </p>
<p>Not so nice approach: Rethinking, because if he already acts so concerning to you, what would he do if there was a tiger attacking you both? Or the total apocalypse hits the major cities (that's no joke, just think of survival), could you rely on him or would he leave you alone with the enemy because he wouldn't even consider you? </p>
<p>Back to normal scenarios though: would he be there for you if you got sick, or maybe even becoming handicapped, would he help you? Would he consider your opinion when something major with your money would happen, like taking debts, building a house and whatnot? </p>
<p>Because he might act similiar there then. Which, to ME atleast, would sadly be a red flag. Depending on your general trust level with him, it might be just a small on, because not a big risk, or maybe it's a major one because he'd do the same with these things like with the vaccine: not considering you and the future of you both.</p>

        <p>To be perfectly honest, I really haven't felt there's been any kind of lockdown where I live since probably April of 2020. Once they started opening things back up for take out and whatnot I've pretty much done whatever I've wanted with the exception of going out to eat/drink. We still had people over (who would come) and I still went riding on my motorcycle. Today, it feels pretty much normal again where I live. I haven't worn a mask since early May. I'm not getting vaccinated, either.</p>

        <p>Not sure what your situation is, but my wife and I have 5 kids and have been fighting this since it started nothing they have said has made sense to either of us and the "trust the science" doesn't work on us. I would in a highly technical field and she has worked in health care, both our mothers are nurses and she has friends that are nurses and nothing they say makes sense. It's like you said no one knows what's going on it's like a big play and we just have not seen the script or something. Now a new version is coming out that is going to be worse and the vaccine doesn't even work on that one. I call bullshit on the whole thing and I don't believe anything they say. I hate to say it, but I really wish Trump would have told them to fuck off and get out of his office and we could have gone Sweden on this bitch and let the cards fall where they would have, but we destroyed the economy, the middle class will never recover from this. We lost a generation of kids that don't know who to believe now (school, doctors, parent, politicians). I constantly have to tell my kids you don't need a mask, you don't need a shot, if anyone asks you about it tell them fuck off it's none of their business. I just am sitting around trying to figure out what the end game is. This country was fucked up before COVID, I like history and have talked with every one I knew before and they all said they had never seen the country this bad before then COVID hit. We will never be the same after this. It's sad really the world has changed and not for the better.</p>

        <p>Check out agenda 2030. 
Also ditch Google get another browser that doesn't censor anything.  Duck duck go is a good anonymous browser. 
Go back to operation paperclip. Then op. Mockingbird and that should be a good enough tmstart to get you on your path. A whole world is about to open up my friends. There's actually a lot more of us than them they just own all the right ones to make it seem like it's reversed. . . Good luck my friend and remember do NOT get that vaccine especially if you want to have kids in the future.</p>

        <p>It depends on which country you live in. Our government is still supporting small businesses and individuals with $2000/month and rent relief until November. It's been going on since last year now. So in other countries that don't have governments that are going to spend the money necessary to make sure people can pay their bills and entertain themselves, it can be very harmful to their mental health</p>

        <p>I live in Canada. It wasn't just $2000/ month to people instantly. It was a program that was created for people who needed it that didn't qualify for unemployment. It was an easy system to apply to and you got your money in 3 days from direct deposit. We also had programs that covered up to 90% of small businesses rent, 75% of their wages up to $50000, and a small business loan that was interest free for $60000 and $15000 is forgiven if it's paid back in two years. </p>
<p>This hasn't ruined our economy, it hasn't caused us to go into a death spiral of inflation. It has caused us to accumulate the most wealth among the people in the last few decades. </p>
<p>The average Canadian has saved up $5000 in 2020, and Canadians in total have accumulated ~$200 billion, far more compared to the previous decades combined. Now coming out of this pandemic, people have a fuck ton of disposable income, and we have federal grants now to retrofit our homes with better Insulation and greener retrofits to save on energy costs, with free inspections. The choices made by our country early on in the pandemic are going to make us come back even stronger because of the investment In the people and keeping them afloat. </p>
<p>And with our new budget passing our Senate, we will start to see an influx of federal money flowing into cities and towns to build infrastructure for the future that can withstand climate change, AND get ourselves a universal childcare system.</p>

        <p>So sorry you're feeling this way, brother (or sister?). We all are to some extent.</p>
<p>The best advice I can give is to give yourself a break. Turn off the TV for a few days, turn off social media (including Reddit) for a few days, get away from the fear/insanity porn, and go out and get some fresh air and exercise. Sunlight and a walk in the woods are the best disinfectant. Basically, just live your life and don't let anyone tell you what to say or think.</p>
<p>While it is important that we push back as best as we can against this authoritarian bullshit and all the sheep who are blindly following along, it's equally important we focus on the things we can control and learn to pass by the things we can't control.</p>
<p>Hang in there, buddy. :-) You're not alone.</p>

        <p>I got banned from 2 subs for posting links to the sites showing the Senator Johnson hearing and the websites devoted to vaccine injuries and deaths. Someone even replied “quit your bullshit”. As if caring for the injured/dead is bullshit. There is zero empathy.</p>

        <p>Just gonna say, as the husband of a nurse, you CAN talk to a health professional about stuff. They might agree with you, they might not.   </p>
<p>Talking about this stuff should not be banned. And, I'll be clear on this, talking your fears through with an expert is what you really should be doing anyway.   </p>
<p>Take a deep breath, and talk to a medical professional you trust. The good ones will be honest, whether that puts them in the vaccine orthodoxy, or outside of it.   </p>

        <p>I feel this way, and I ended my relationship because he got the vaccine, even though he was pretty much coerced into it.
But we can’t be intimate ever again because of it so there’s no point continuing the relationship.
And yes, everything feels surreal and bizzare, dark, sinister, hilarious and absurd</p>

        <p>I think people think it is easier to not think than to think especially if what they're told sounds righteous. So they just listen to what CNN says. Many of these people are legitimately convinced that this is the deadliest outbreak in human history when it is actually a fairly regular, not very concerning one. We have had much much <em>much</em> worse than this.</p>
<p>If you are legitimately concerned with your health or have serious preexisting conditions, it might be worth considering taking the risk for a vaccine. If you are perfectly healthy, and under 85 years old, there isn't much of a reason to get it. And some of the cons might outweigh the pros. I'm glad to see there are some people figuring this out on their own now.</p>
<p>Don't be a statist because everyone around you is. It's not that government is a bad thing, it's that they have too much power. And it is being run by the media and creatures that not long ago descended from ancient apes. Smartest creatures on the planet, true. But we live on a really stupid planet.</p>

        <p>The only answer... and the one that's hard to hear is that people have been completely and utterly brainwashed</p>
<p>I've felt the same way. Took me an entire week to talk to my GF and convince her not to get the vaccine, but even still I don't think she <em>really</em> gets what's happening. DM me if you want to talk, happy to talk to you how I did it</p>
<p>Meditation, walks outside, talking about it (even if it's forums like this) help a lot. Have to remember, we are the sane ones</p>

        <p>You still can discuss it with a health professional.  I'd recommend seeing an MD.  I've seen different credentials and actual physicians are the best since they have yrs of experience.  You may or may not luck out and get one that is more pro-lockdown however.</p>

        <p>Hate to say it, but maybe this is a sign you are not compatible w/ your partner.  Imagine finding a partner who thinks like you and whom you can discuss all this with. When it comes to anything related to the Church of Covid; opposites do not attract.</p>

        <p>Also it seems you and your partner have some different fundamental beliefs, if you don’t have kids together or married I’d really think about separating, I dated someone who was on the opposite side of the political spectrum than I am, it was okay for awhile but it unraveled in 2016, the only way it was going to work is if one of us caved and just lived unhappy, so we split. I couldn’t imagine if I was with her through the past year, I’m sure she would think I’m an ignorant fool for not believing in lockdowns and experimental shots.</p>

        <p>&rt;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.</p>

        <p>On a big picture scale, there is a massive power struggle and failed attempts at globalization. Misinformation or spamming information that is not really important is the main device for modern warefare. </p>
<p>Alot of the covid shit was a way to run up some capital. The can was kicked from 2008 economic disaster. We never actully recovered. The US dollar has a massive competition they can’t control the way they wish to (crypto). Run an experiment, see how many minds they actually control. I don’t know what the purpose of the vaccine was other then to counter chinas influence with their vaccine which they were using as a political tool. </p>
<p>The impending economic crisis is probably the biggest reason, it is the result of the failures of government control, fed control, derivatives market, and failed globalism.</p>

        <p>OP for what is worth I am very sorry for your situation. It’s hard when you can see what it seems most people can not. I think everyone in this group or at least a majority has gone through your situation long ago, probably not related to the pandemic before that. Pardon if it seems insensitive to your situation as I know no one means it to seem that way. Don’t want to scare you away by going tin foil hat on you but the phrase Conspiracy theorists was created by people in the United States government as a way of looking down on and discrediting people who speak out about the truth. That’s not to say every so called conspiracy theory is true, that would be impossible as there are probably 100 different so called conspiracy theories just about 9/11. But they all center around our government either creating or being complicit with terrorists and knowing ahead of time and letting 9/11 happen and then using it as a war cry to go establish a “democracy” in Iraq. So there is a common theme and that’s important. Do you want to believe a bunch of crazies on the internet or believe the government that has shut down services to Citizens who gravely need them, who has killed tens of thousands of small family run businesses while letting the huge corporations(their friends and business partners) remain open, who has admitted to smuggling cocaine in to the country in government airplanes and selling it in low income(mostly black but not only black they hate poor people all the same) communities. The list goes on and on.</p>

        <p>It's such a weird disconnect: almost all the comments on YouTube about COVID are red-pilled as fuck but here in Australia people are eating up the propaganda like pigs at a trough. I wonder if fellow Australians know this is all bullshit; they're just complying to fit in or because we don't really have any other option.</p>

        <p>it is, op. ppl are losing their minds. fwiw, narratives change amongst the "experts" really often. like, a certain subreddit got quarantined (lmao) for daring to talk of the origins of the virus in feb 2020. now, their theory is more mainstream, but that sr is still hidden. with the vax, it was, bell's palsy (remember that?) then the clots then now the heart issues and period issues and the girl who is now on the feeding tube. so its entirely reasonable that what you're saying just becomes mainstream in a year or so.</p>

        <p>If you want to know what's going on, here you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/OGGwv3Zjq88">This music video</a> very accurately depicts the coming new world order. The chess match symbolizes the battle between good and evil which seems to be greatly favoring evil. The music video shows cameras everywhere and depicts a dystopian surveillance state. The girl who is outcast from society and is shown begging on the streets depicts all of those who resist the new world order. The plan of the elites is to shut out everyone who does not comply until they finally do in a moment of weakness and desperation. The girl's face is blurred out the moment she accepts the agenda of the new world order and begins to fully comply with it. This symbolizes her human identity and human agency being taken from her. She is no longer a person but rather another cog in the machine like everyone else. The only other faces you see in the music video belong to the band members. They know what they are doing and want to serve Lucifer.</p>

        <p>This is what years in the preparation do. We have been conditioned for a long time for this. A good example is all the zombie movies, outbreaks, disease movies. Those created the only references for us. If I tell you we're going fishing and you've never fished before, you'll be using those memories from seeing people on the TV or online that were fishing as a reference to know what it should be like. Then they created the medias hype and big initial scare from covid (when people hoarded toilet paper, lysol wipes and food). Then everybody is separated and isolated, everyone turns to official sources to know wtf is happening, official sources constantly repeat and repeat and condition the mental state of everyone. They literally created the reality of what is at the present time, just like an hypnotist could influence the subconscious of the most susceptible by simply snapping his fingers (look up messmer on youtube for example, hes the real deal). The others took longer conditioning and exhaustion. The longuet the stressful state, mixed with isolation and distress go, the more and more they gained people with the repetition and conditioning.  Now you are basically left only with those that this conditioning takes a hell lot more effort and those that just can't be told what to do. It's like torture in slow motion.</p>

        <p>It is a terrifying yet completely freeing realization that the world at large is deeply deceived on many areas of life. It it’s okay! The truth will set you free and now you are on a journey of truth! Seek God and ask him. All will be made right in the end. Do NOT fall into despair, check out Michael Malice on “the white pill”. If you give into fear, you’re falling victim to the same mindset of the irrational NPC’s who go through life scared of everything. </p>
<p>Over time you will be able to build a community in real life that sees life the way you do. Nobody here agrees on everything, but we all agree the corporate press and the government are lying and manipulating people to stay in power. It’s been the story of humanity ever since the garden of eden lol. </p>
<p>Definitely check out Dan Mohler as well, but that’s slightly off topic. He’s more for the spiritual truth:)</p>

        <p>Your partner is probably scared and sees the vaccine as the only effective protection. Not a crazy point of view. You could try showing him this risk calculator to ease his mind. </p>

<p>Then again if he's actually high risk, a serious discussion must be had. Good luck.</p>

        <p>Those individuals want to be safe. And they don't know how to balance safety against progress nor do they know how to be safe without anyone telling them how to. A society that demands 100 % safety can't defend itself from threats or conquer new land or inventions. You will be invaded or get run over by your more risk taking neighbors.</p>
<p>I have a job that can kill me if I'm not careful. I have to use my common sense every day to balance my safety against the customers needs and expectations. I am the boss here. Nobody can ask me to be less careful at any time, only more.</p>
<p>I don't need some text on my ladder that tells me it's possible to fall if I climb it. I know that coffee is hot. Peanut butter contains peanuts! A steep cliff don't need a sign that tells me I can fall off. I know I get sick from viruses so I need to be somewhat careful not to go home to someone sick.</p>

        <p>It is called risk/benefit analysis. Any action has risks. But it has benefits too. Pharmaceutical companies provide tons of information to CDC to convince them that the benefits significantly outweighs the risks before CDC accepts a new drug/vaccine.</p>

        <p>Maybe this explanation will help:
A lockdown is the lesser of two bad situations. The other situation is that because covid spreads so easily, everyone contracts it within 2 months. There aren’t nearly enough hospital spaces to help the number of people that would need it, so they shut down. All emergency and basic services shut down for an unknown amount of time; maybe weeks, maybe months- no hospital, no fire, no police, no grocery store. Almost no one has the skills and resources to live off the grid and self-sustain. Life becomes a form of apocalyptic dystopia. The mental health, livelihoods, development, loneliness, poverty would be even worse. (Billionaires with idle money could fix most of that, but that’s a different topic.)
Meanwhile, sick, dying, dead, and decomposing grandparents are everywhere.</p>
<p>A different way to think about it: you (a hospital) hear someone (a future patient) knock on your door and say they’re baking a treat but need a cup of milk (medical care). You can help that one person, no problem. But…
3 days later, 2 other neighbors come to your door. 
3 days later, 4 neighbors.
3 days later, 8 neighbors. 
3 days later, 16 neighbors. 
3 days later, 32 neighbors.
And it’s only been 2 weeks. 
After a month, a thousand will be at your door, at once. 
You won’t want to have, but you will have stopped answering your door.</p>

        <p>Look you seem pretty stressed so if you don't want to talk to like a doctor I'd really recommend a psychologist. They were a great help to a lot of my friends in these times. Maybe even couples counseling if you feel that your relationship with your partner is strained. It's not just something for mentally ill people, I'd recommend it to anyone who feels like they are losing their mind like you said you feel.</p>

        <p>Basic science.  Basic common sense.  Why would we poison or implant our doctors first?  You’re upping your chances of dying and being an incubator every day without the vaccine.  </p>
<p>What would we do in a world with no doctors?  Rely on government.  You’re knowledge is on point.  Your perspective is off.  Let yourself believe all perspectives before coming to a conclusion.  See what they see.  </p>
<p>Neither party is good.  But the hypocrisy… and the average news report with these people are nuts or religious.  They are nuts.</p>

        <p>I write science fiction.  You’re not wrong that a vaccine is risky.  But it’s your only choice.  You’ll die from the mutations.  I’ve studied this shit personally.  My own eyes.  Own hands.</p>
<p>I studied science.  A masters isn’t much but it’s something more than what you have with Facebook posts.  You can’t tell me that science doesn’t exist because it was too hard for you to comprehend.  </p>
<p>You can’t run from problems and make them disappear.  trump has zero understanding of herd immunity.  You have never taken even a 400 level ecology class.</p>
<p>If you don’t get the vaccine, you are a fucking incubator for its evolution.  I’m obviously misunderstanding this subreddit.  But you’re an idiot.  Whoever buys this bullshit can picture trumps spray tanned face when they choke their last breath.  You’re an uneducated threat to the world.</p>
<p>But you want to, what?  Sell more cars, work more kids in your factory, or manipulate the housing market to your advantage while others sleep outside?  </p>
<p>What the fuck are you defending?  You’re going to get sick and you’re going to think of me.  That’s going to piss you off while you’re sick.</p>

        <p>Do you know how alleles transfer?  Or what an allele is without googling it?  You don’t understand science and you’re a fucking incubator, dumbass.  Your stupidity is a threat to the survival of everyone.  Stop fucking following people.  Both parties blow.  Science is real.  You have a phone that tracks you.  We wouldn’t poison doctors first.  You’re a world class fucking moron.  It is painfully difficult for me to put myself in your shoes.  Zero order or understanding.</p>
