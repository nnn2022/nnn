        <p>I deliberately tip more to try to help them out. It’s sad that the government has destroyed restaurant worker’s livelihoods so bad that regular people have to make up the difference, but here we are</p>

        <p>Less tips because no one is making shit anymore and are struggling to keep some normalcy in life even if it comes off as rude (as in not tipping) and while sexual harassment is inexcusable in all forms ever no matter what - you isolate people and those who are already fucked in the head aren't gonna magic themselves better so yeah I'd believe the predators are "struggling" to find prey now what with bars, club, etc being closed.</p>
<p>Again, I don't want to sound like I'm excusing predators for even a second but it isn't "the type of people going to restaurants" in the way this person implies. It's "the predators being forced into a small bundle of society closer to the rest of us" type thing, is my first thought..and that those who <em>may</em> have not actually harassed or assaulted before are now even more angry and feeling out of control therefore they snap to the next level - <em>something</em> would have caused it eventually but this is likely the tipping point for some to excuse their nasty.</p>

        <p>I work in hospitality and these "memes" are the stupidest shit. </p>
<p>We're only outdoor dining and I am VERY thankful for the patrons who come drink beer outside in 35-40 degree weather. There's not a lot of them but they still come to support us. If people are tipping shitty and sexually harassing, maybe it's your place of employment and not the plandemic.</p>

        <p>Bartender here, who has spoken with many other bartenders and wait staff from multiple states for the last 6 months. My tips have been just fine, if not better than normal, on a per-person basis. Likewise for everyone else I've asked about it.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, up in Maine, I've gotten a big increase in guests from Mass, NY, and other really restrictive states who are more than happy (or I guess, <em>were</em> more than happy - thanks Gov. Mills) to come spend their money up this way. They were all awesome people, seriously. The only "those type of people" I really get are locals, if anything. But even then, I have regulars who are multi-millionaire, stand-up, family-oriented people who tip exceptionally well. People who also hate all these mandates and restrictions, who aren't at all afraid of this virus.</p>
<p>So he can fuck right off with his "those type of people" comment.</p>

        <p>My tips are pretty good, most people are standard 18-20% tippers. And a lot of really friendly people come in. I have only had a few people give me shit about Covid- one guy freaked out because I didn’t “disinfect” the chairs to his standards. But most of those types aren’t going out so we are able to serve the normal people who still enjoy being out with friends and enjoying life.</p>

        <p>Every time I go out or order food since this all started I tip like 30%. Because I know they lost a ton of  business due to bullshit restrictions. Not trying to virtue signal or say everyone should be expected to do this but I could afford it and wanted to. If you consistently tip well you will also be treated well by places you’re a regular at, at least smaller restaurants which are the only places I go to now so it’s kinda mutually beneficial. This person just doesn’t like their job.</p>
<p>Also I don’t really buy the sexual harassment thing? Unfortunately it always happens and I’m very against it but how would this cause it to increase? It makes no sense, it just seems like she added that for internet points. I’m a woman btw and I have dealt with plenty of sexual harassment, still do occasionally, it sucks but it has nothing to do with people “being selfish” during covid.</p>
