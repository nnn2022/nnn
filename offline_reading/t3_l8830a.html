        <p>When I read the memoirs of Albert Speer (Nazi architect and armaments minister) one of the things that stuck with me was his warning that advances in technology come with a price for humanity. He mostly talked about how the control of radio by the German government was instrumental in shaping the support of the people. Radio in Nazi Germany sounds very much like all the big tech companies today. If a new technology can be used in nefarious ways I think you must be prepared to accept that some people would use it for such.</p>

        <p>dont even get me started om music frequency programming. to expand on your radio point, mainstream corporate music companies play music at 440hz which has a negative impact on our mental health. its the brown note. police use this sort of technology today, they can zap people to silence them if need be. most dont use it no correct and youll probably never see it in YOUR lifetime but somebody will, somebody will one day get shot with a "mute gun" if we continue down this road. And do you want to know how i know? i lived through it, in care. thats where they get some of our kids, in care. let the games begin. i used to have alarms on my door, i couldnt even have a mobile phone to talk to friends and family, i couldnt even leave the house without being accompanied by somebody. and this still goes on today, its not fair, wake up. why are people feeding their system, heres a headline for you "kids are stripped away from thier homes and put into care with completely and utter strangers. Are you crazy, most of the time it comes from young parents, they like the young couple children dont they or the young kids. Once you get to a certian age in this society you get thrown out, youre ireelevant and your opinion is "too traditional" because youve witnessed it all unfold. i was put in the system to be silenced, any logical thinking person these days is considered a conspiracy theories or crazy fuck but in actuality they are the ones seeing it, like how some people talk about whats on the news or celebrities "false idols", the ones who witness the crazy and disgusting shit are also the ones that talk about it" will this wake people up??? plese? ive found the bottom of the rabbit hole and nobody wants to talk about it</p>
