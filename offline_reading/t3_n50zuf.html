    <strong>Vaccine mortality rates (for young 1:15 000, for old 1:3000)</strong>
    <p><p>"A statistical analysis of data from the CBS combined with information from the Ministry of Health leads to the conclusion that the mortality rate amongst the vaccinated is estimated at 1:5,000</p>
<p>1:13,000 for ages 20-491:6,000 for ages 50-691:1600 for ages 70+"</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>Similarly AZ batch in Norway, theoretical size 80k vaccinations, were spread between healthcare workers, and the elderly, and stopped before all vaccines were given, due to two young healthcare workers dying. So even in most conservative estimate the death ratio was 1:40 000 but likely closer to 1:20 000.</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>UK official data:</p>
<p>1:33 000</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>And these numbers are already subject to diagnostic bias!</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>Add your own evidence and maybe we can crowd source the accurate numbers.</p></p>

        <p>And the mortality rate for COVID-19 is 1:500 if you're going to use the 99.8% survivability statistic that's so often used here. Obviously COVID-19 is far more deadly than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Bro.  Bro no it isn’t.  It just isn’t, I mean there were actually more people on the planet earth at the start of 2021 than the start of 2020.  There’s no way in all of sweet fuckland that you can say with a straight face you believe Covid is that deadly.  Have you looked around? Been masking over your eyes? Maybe you haven’t been outside for a year and you just presume that people are dropping in the streets like flies? It’s a joke.  People like you are a joke.  Not laughing tho, cuz I want my freedoms back and your blind ignorance and compliance is standing in the way of that.</p>

        <p>There were over 500,000 excess deaths in the US between March 2020 and February 2021, AKA during the COVID-19 pandemic. You think those just came from nowhere, and a novel coronavirus that's deadly had nothing to do with it? Why do you have so much doubt about the death counts? If you take the sum total of US COVID-19 deaths divided by total US reported COVID-19 cases, the fatality rate is 1.7%. I was being extremely generous saying it was 0.2%, which would still make it far less deadly than these supposed vaccine fatality rates.</p>
<p>Of course people aren't visibly dropping on the streets left and right because they're dying in hospitals or at home. You're not sauntering around town when you're dying. Try denying the deaths to someone that works at a funeral home that was slammed, or works in an ICU.</p>

        <p>Actually,  all the reports I see from ACTUAL people, instead of the paid shills on mainstream news networks who are lying through their teeth with manipulative sob stories and hired actors who pretend they are doctors (this has been proven with multiple “expert doctors” on news networks) shows that ICUs have been consistently empty this entire time.  The “Covid deaths” statistic is completely 100% fraudulent.  They test bodies after they are dead with the completely fraudulent PCR test and put that down as Covid death.  It’s been proven that doctors have been paid extra to mark EVERY DEATH that comes through down as a Covid death.  I don’t know how you can believe the Covid death numbers but they are an absolute fear mongering manipulative joke so that globalists can march their plan forward uninhibited.  The vaccines are literally just a massive attack on women and fertility and part of the depopulation agenda.</p>

        <p>The vaccines do not cause infertility, just temporary menstrual disruption in some women. That's been seen before in other vaccines, and they didn't cause infertility either. If the globalists were trying a depopulation agenda, and you believe COVID-19 was a part of that, why wouldn't it be deadly to speed that up? What's the benefit of putting hundreds of thousands of people on expensive ventillators they can't afford, and will file medical bankruptcy over? When these rent moratoriums end, even more people will file for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy has been made intentionally more difficult to file for because corporations don't like not being paid. Biden was one of the architects of that legislation. If you believe it's a ruse, why would Biden continue it when he's so indebted to credit card companies lobbying him to reduce bankruptcy?</p>

        <p>I don’t believe the numbers are inflated, the numbers ARE inflated.  They’re completely inaccurate nonsense in fact and that’s easily provable with a quick google search for what the actual parameters are for Covid deaths.  They haven’t tried to say any major celebrities have died of Covid because they don’t have to.  The charade has already tricked a large portion of the population into complete and total self destruction out of fear even tho another quick google search will tell you that Covid-19 has YET to be sequenced fully and therefore STILL HAS NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY PROVEN TO EXIST.  Tie that in with the ludicrously laughable reports that the Regularly flu is “down 95% this year” and you have to be a grade A idiot to not see that Covid is the flu rebranded with a 24/7 marketing team.  The lies aren’t even good lies they are thinly veiled bullshit.  I think the irony is coming out tho the Various Covid Vaxxs have already killed a bunch of older or B list celebrities, before you ask me why it’s not the big stars who are dying and it’s obviously because they aren’t actually taking the medical poison theyre giving to the population, you can find proof of the propaganda in lots of the celebrity live vaxxings where you can clearly see they either used prop retractable needles or just didn’t get the shot at all.  In Anthony Hopkins vaxx up the nurse literally squirts the juice out the window.</p>
