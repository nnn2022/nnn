    <strong>I’m getting so angry at myself.</strong>
    <p><p>I should be more than able to wake my friends, roommates and family up. I’ve done the research. I have a way with words and formulating logical arguments. I’m coming from a place of love and concern for the people I care about. </p>
<p>WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY? WHY can’t they fucking wake up!!!!???!! I just sent my friend the CDC director saying the vaccinated carry an equal viral load and they’re recommending masks, and he said “this wouldn’t be happening if people (like yourself) got vaccinated”</p>
<p>I said “If the vaccine is effective, it shouldn’t matter what other people do. Vaccinated people can still contract and spread the virus, so you’ll need boosters. Everyone has access to the vaccine so therefore it’s up to the population to freely weigh the risks of a vaccine historically made in 8 months, with tech that has a decades long history of terrible outcomes. It’s also the most universally obvious propagandistic technique that’s led to authoritarianism. Government gets a group mad at another group for something the government is doing, so the people never unite and see the real problem being the government. That’s why in countries like the UK, Greece, Spain, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Armania, Switzerland, on and on, are having the biggest protests in human history. It doesn’t end with one vaccine, you’ll need to keep getting boosters for new variants and complying with demands which I’ll have no part in. “A man who gives up his freedom for safety, deserved neither freedom nor safety”- Benjamin Franklin”</p>
<p>He didn’t even respond.</p>
<p>NOTHING WORKS! NOTHING I CAN SAY WILL PENETRATE THESE PEOPLES WORLDVIEW! Logic doesn’t matter. History doesn’t matter. A heaping mound of concrete evidence doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters is fear and compliance. I can’t blame anyone but myself for my absolute inadequacy in helping these people see the truth. I’m fucking hopeless, sad, and extremely angry that I can’t help, when I LIVE to discover and share the truth. I don’t want to give up, but fuck it, I’m done.</p>
<p>Edit: if you have any background or knowledge of psychology I could really use some explanation behind cult brainwashing and deprogramming. Explain to me why this is so damn hopeless.</p></p>

        <p>Anyone who wears a mask and gets injected with the poisons for these scamdemics is part of a giant cult. You can't awaken a brainwashed cultist. You are wasting your time with attempting to do so. The sheep, the brainwashing media, and the government are all the enemy of all of us who are awake.</p>

        <p>The problem with people is when they’re wrong, they often dig their heels in and refuse to admit it, and will instead double down. Because it’s easier for them to tell themselves they’re right and someone else is wrong (even if they have to tell themselves <em>everyone</em> else is wrong) than it is to admit <em>they</em> were wrong. I think most people are guilty of it and it’s pretty normal.</p>

        <p>I actually do have some knowledge about psychology.</p>
<p>Just giving your information usually doesn't work. You first need to generate curiosity for what you have to say.</p>
<p>A way to do that is asking them a question to which what you want to tell them is the answer.</p>
<p>After someone has answered a question you have asked them, they are usually much more curious about how you would answer that same question.</p>
<p>"What do you think about our government?"</p>
<p>"How do you decide whom you consider trustworthy?"</p>
<p>"What do you think is the reason that some people do not want to take the vaccine?"</p>
<p>"What is your information about how the vaccines are supposed to work?"</p>
<p>Another thing is making statements about your thoughts and opinions rather than presenting what you want to say as objective truth.
This leaves room for different opinions and middle-grounds.</p>
<p>Just add "I think" or "In my opinion" or "I've heard" to your statements. Also mention from who you heard something, if you use other people's statements.</p>
<p>For example "I've seen an interview with Dr. ... and he said that ..." Instead of just saying what he said.</p>
<p>The more you can talk about how you got to your opinion, the better.</p>

        <p>as someone with a background in psych, I concur with all of this. They have to come to their own conclusion.  You can gently guide them to that conclusion by asking them questions, but just throwing the facts at them will lead to a reaction response that will inadvertently strengthen their erroneous beliefs, as 1) it is part of human nature to not want to be wrong, and 2) such a monumental upheaval of their belief system is one of the hardest pills to swallow, and will lead to denial. You can guide them to opening their eyes, but they have to decide when they will start to see</p>

        <p>I'd like to add that one's own mindset when going into such conversation shouldn't be "I must change their mind" and instead "I want to inspire them to think about their beliefs". Being focused on the outcome rather than the process itself has a much higher tendency of ending up in frustration.</p>
<p>I picked up this stuff for doing animal-rights activisms. And in my experience much more comes out of it when I ask "What do you think about animal-agriculture?" than when I tell someone all about how it is.</p>

        <p>My friend laughed at me for believing in Agenda 21 and 2030. I tell her to read House Resolution 353 from the 102nd Congress. People are so quick to dismiss when they can literally get the info right from the horses mouth. I'm done trying to reach others.
