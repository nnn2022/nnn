    <strong>Parents over stepping boundaries about vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Kinda an odd situation today. My daughter was swimming in the pool at our hotel in Florida (on vacation from the crazy) she had made a nice friend and they began to talk about the vaccine. I believe my daughter said that she isn‚Äôt sure about it and was worried because the little girl was about to get it. Well the little girls dad came over and more or less told her not to listen to me (her mother) and that vaccines have been around forever and it‚Äôs safe. I swam over and politely introduced myself, I said that all view points are valid and thank you for the concern, he goes on to tell me that we‚Äôre never going to get out of this unless everyone is vaccinated... man there‚Äôs just no escaping this stuff. 
I am happy to report that I haven‚Äôt seen a single mask here yet :) it‚Äôs been wonderful so far here. Go Florida!</p></p>

        <p>If she meets another child then there should be no harm of your daughter speaking from her heart to another fellow child. These are dire times, and something big is brewing. Believe in what your heart tells you, and the same goes for your daughter. Let her speak from her heart. Love knows no bounds, and you both come from a place of love and no ill intent, so be friendly and say your piece. Just be careful of the crazy ones because they‚Äôre stressed and will attack those of us who are questioning these vaccines, lockdowns, masks &amp; social distancing. Good luck! üëç</p>

        <p>Sorry, I hope I didn‚Äôt come off as rude or too over bearing. If you‚Äôve got the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/t9PBCXSK80s"><strong>watch this video about the bacteria in our gut.</strong></a> The reason why I‚Äôm sharing this is because our gut acts as a second brain and it can also give you guidance when you feel something is off. We have a symbiosis with good bacteria in our bodies. So as the old expression goes ‚ÄúListen to your gut!‚Äù

        <p>My pleasure in helping out. If you ever get the chance, please visit <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>this website</strong></a>, as it has a plethora of well researched information. The journalist, Ryan Christian, is not a doctor, but is a very well respected independent investigative journalist, and he knows his craft very well. YouTube constantly bans or causes trouble for him, so he usually has good info on his website, and he's recently started uploading to a video web portal called Super.U, but he'll continue to post on YouTube until the day where they ban him permanently. Cheers!</p>

        <p>Gut health was the first thing I worked on when it started. I even make my own probiotic drinks now. Haven't been sick at all, even though my son tested positive for the rona. Considering I know LOTS of people who haven't been sick, that doesn't necessarily mean it works. But I'm still very happy to keep it up.</p>

        <p>That's wonderful, I'm really happy to hear you're making your own probiotic drinks. :)  By the way, I think the PCR test is being used incorrectly. If you have the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ibaXq3iUA"><strong>please watch how the deception works</strong></a>. The NWO (or whatever you want to call them) is so devious and ingenious that I never would have known if it weren't for Andrew's video. </p>
<p>Even the inventor, Dr. Kary Mullis, said his invention (PCR) <a href="https://www.theobserver.ca/opinion/are-there-too-many-false-negatives-being-tested"><strong>shouldn't be used to detect (diagnose) for a virus</strong></a>. There was a video, but many websites have deleted or scrubbed many of his interviews from the past. He despised Fauci too! (I'll try to find this one important interview with him and a French journalist). Anyways, the PCR test can't tell if the sampled genetic material is from a live or dead virus (dead as in our body's immune system found a virus and killed it off). This generates too many false positives. In essence the test is just a glorified photocopier; it makes multiple copies of the sampled material, so that the observer will have an easier time of seeing what the genetic sequence is from the sampled genetic material extracted from the patient or tissue/mucus/blood sample.</p>

        <p>That's exactly why I always say "tested positive" instead of saying he had it. He had a moderate headache and a mild fever that came and went for TWO DAYS. Then he was totally fine. Hardly what one would expect from a very "deadly" and super "contagious" virus that has every symptom imaginable. Nobody else caught it. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>It's like they don't realize humanity got through all the other pandemics before vaccines existed... and most of those actually boasted frightening death rates.  So yes, eventually a pandemic runs out of hosts and most people are still alive.</p>
<p>This one, if anything would leave billions of people alive with a few million dead world wide.  I'm sorry you can't prevent every death, but somehow we recognized the reality of this a year ago with the goal of minimizing death, though now we just hand wring over a fraction of a percent.</p>

        <p>Diseases are always going to kill some people.  You can't avoid it.  Either way, it doesn't change the reality that pandemics have ended previously without vaccines or humanity wouldn't have survived to the point it could make them.</p>
<p>Covid isn't as deadly as feared for most people on earth.  Mitigating the threat as much as you want is fine, but you also need to make peace with the fact you aren't going to eliminate it.  Even the vaccine still has break through deaths, 132 of them, and it will only grow with time.</p>
