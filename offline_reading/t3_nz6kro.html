    <strong>Big Pharma Lobbyists</strong>
    <p><p>People that have researched the Covid vaccines have a good understanding of how Big Pharma operates and that’s why they don’t trust the vaccine. I’ve said this before and I’m going to say it again.. Once you figure out how the government works as opposed to how the government tells you they work you start to look at things in a whole new light. Quid Pro Quo is the best term in describing how the politicians on both sides of the political spectrum, the CDC, the FDA, and Big Pharma work together. While the majority of Americans were locked down last year worried if they were going to be able to pay rent, big pharma lobbyists were dispatched to DC to fight for Covid vaccine contracts. Lobbyists showered Congress members, the CDC, and the FDA with cash. In 2020 alone, lobbyists donated 300 million in the form of grants, foundation donations, and donations to campaign war chests. To better understand these payoffs you must look at the history. In 1983 the CDC was first given authorization to start accepting gifts from big industry (big pharma). In 1993 George Bush Sr (swamp rat) encouraged relationships (funding) between the CDC and big pharma (lobbyists) funneling the money through the non- profit CDC foundation. The FDA who is responsible for the advisory committees (who approve drugs and vaccines) receive 75% of its drug review budget from Big Pharma. The FDA and it’s advisory committees DO receive kickbacks (bribes) for fast tracking drugs and vaccines. Committee members cannot receive the kickbacks (bribes) while going through the approval process due to conflict of interest so they are paid after the approval process as there is no requirement for committee members to disclose that information after the drugs are approved. The big three manufacturers of the Covid Vaccines performed months not years of clinical trials to rush these vaccines to market. Currently we are seeing vaccinated individuals suffer from Covid, heart issues, blood clots, neurological issues, and sudden death. The “experts” that report the vaccines are safe have no longterm data to support these claims as the average length of time for clinical trials to a drug being ready to enter the market is 12 years. These vaccines were developed and entered the market in under a year. The fact that people don’t question all of this and blindly get the shot is absolutely insane. </p>
