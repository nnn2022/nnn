<title>(Ireland, UK, Canada) Claiming you're exempt from wearing a mask seems entirely hit or miss from my observations, police contacted in some cases. If you have small children or any other obligations, be careful that they don't make an example out of you!</title>

    <p><p>Now, I'm only going to speak for Ireland, because I don't know the situation in the UK or Canada exactly, but claiming exemption seems to be a hit or miss thing. </p>
<p>Some stores will be respectful and let you continue on, others will refuse to serve you, even if you point out that it's illegal to refuse service. Some will demand a letter from a doctor, others will even refuse letters. Brown Thomas have done this, their <a href="https://brownthomas.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/bt-face-coverings-policy-statement">official policy</a> is to not allow people in, even with a letter from the doctor. </p>
<p>Simply claiming exemption without a letter has, in many cases led to the Gardai (police) being called here and I have heard of some people being arrested, as even the police themselves think that you need evidence (this is incorrect) </p>
<p>Just a few days ago, we had a [man pulled off a train and taken into custody] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utq5DGUl7Wg) by 2 gardai, even with a letter from his doctor! </p>
<p>I agree that we need to continue taking off the masks in large numbers, but those of you with small children you need to care for or with something else to lose also need to be careful in case they try make an example out of you. It is pure scare tactics to keep us compliant, but I don't want to see people's lives ruined over it.</p></p>
