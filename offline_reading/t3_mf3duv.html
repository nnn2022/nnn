        <p>Holy shit, I don’t even know what to say but this really woke me up. Thank you for sharing OP. I’m going to go on a rabbit hole on her work/opinions because WOW. Everyone should see this! </p>
<p>I use to be somewhat pro vaccine to fda regulated ones but this doctor is exposing the data and TRUTH... wow. I have waken up completely. She’s admitting that we are not doing science, this is WARFARE. </p>
<p>“Warfare starts out at a psychological level” </p>
<p>“I want people to know vaccines are DANGEROUS.. we have enough data to know that vaccines can cause damage immediately... we need to give our parents enough information to make an informed decision”</p>
<p>I’m actually so sad because I took the HPV vaccine and there are deaths associated with it, long term medical conditions and there is no proof and she states it’s totally useless, “no proof that there is any efficacy, solid proof it is harmful yet people are sacrificing their kids to the vaccine Gods”</p>
<p>Oof. Thanks Doctor nancy I’ll never be taking another toxic jab in my life!</p>

        <p>The media did an impressive job suppressing this information and for years I was brainwashed into thinking it’s okay and I use to get my flu shot every year. I have adhd and it makes me wonder if it’s from all the vaccines we’re forced to take in order to attend school. Sad to know this become modern warfare and we have become so complicit. (Not this sub but generality as a society)</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm guilty of that myself. I never took the flu one because I knew it was completely pointless but I took many others. It's basically the same phenomenon that we see now with COVID: people are scared and don't question anything. But these days, with all the information available, you have no excuse to continue following recommendations blindly.</p>

        <p>That's a really great video. She has a whole lot of points that are good, great, or excellent.  I urge everybody to invest the time to watch it through.</p>
<p>There is one thing that she said that I want to take exception to.  She said (not intended to be an exact quote) that the only thing that has changed over the period of time that the prevalence of autism went from 1 per 10,000 (IIRC) to 1 per 100 is that there's a lot more vaccinations.</p>
<p>Another critical thing that has changed over the same time is that our food has become less nutritious, in numerous different ways.  </p>
<p>These include: soil nutrient depletion especially as promoted by non-sustainable farming practices, worsening animal farming practices resulting in diminishing nutrition from animal foods, ever more processing of foods that reduces nutrient content out of the raw food stocks, substitution of actual food elements with chemical components that only impart a smell or flavor of the actual actual foods, ever increasingly higher price per nutrition points, ever smaller packages, advertising campaigns that promote corporate self-interests which leads to reduced diversity of food intake, deliberately induced lower and lower public knowledge and awareness of the crucial importance of nutrition and the requirements for nutrition, outright deception (and in some cases: lies) about "we get all the nutrition we need from our diet", pseudoscience with self-interests in selling products to "treat" health problems that may have been caused by a lack of proper nutrition (rather than a lack of those synthetic molecule products), and probably some other things I'm not bringing to mind right now.</p>
<p>Autism is a matter of the functionality of the brain.  <strong>The brain is physical.</strong>  Every different part of our bodies requires good healthy nutrition.  Without that, you can't expect it to work correctly.</p>
<p>During the same time period that the prevalence of autism has dramatically gone up, so have the prevalences of numerous other conditions that pharmacutical corporations, medical device manufacturers, and those that derive revenue from a scalpel have targeted for deriving profit off of either directly or from secondary problems, such as obesity, auto-immune problems, cardiovascular problems, brain problems, and so on.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, and on top of that I would add a whole range of toxins resulting from human activity, which didn't exist previously (or not in such great amounts) and that now permeate virtually everything in our lives. Sites like <a href="https://www.ewg.org">this</a> can be helpful.</p>
