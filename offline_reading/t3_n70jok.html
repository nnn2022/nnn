    <strong>isn't bribery coercion ? isn't coercion wrong?</strong>
    <p><p>perhaps a smart lawyer could help me here?</p>
<p>the vaccines are not FDA approved.</p>
<p>so if someone wants to offer a free whatever (beer/donut/movie ticket) for you to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>is that bribery or coercion?</p>
<p>is the sponsor or sponsors of said "incentives"  <strong>Coupable</strong>  and responsible for any resulting damages ?</p>
<p>say if Duff beer would give you a free beer for you to take the vaccine and you were harmed or killed as a result, wouldn't your family have recourse ?</p>
<p>is this any different than incentivizing people to "try" cigarettes with free samples and swag?</p>
<p>i can almost hear the testimony now of how someone was not provided "informed consent" or wasn't able to understand it due to education level or some of the similar stuff presented during tobacco suits .</p>
<p>"so and so had a problem with alcohol and was unable to resist a free beer" </p>
<p>it all just stinks of liability to me .</p></p>

        <p>I think it’s more of a “if you get the shot you’re eligible for a free donut” not “if you don’t get the shot you don’t get any donuts” whether or not you get the shot you still have access to the donuts. Nothing is being with held from you if you don’t get the shot. Bribery would be enticing you to do something that you wouldn’t have the reasonable means to do otherwise.</p>
