    <strong>The discussion of nicotine as a Covid Treatment has been silenced while Pharma uses Tobacco plants for their vaccines.</strong>
    <p><p>Having followed pharma's manipulation of both the vaping industry and opioid epidemic my ears perked up this time last year when French scientists drew a correlation between nicotine and Covid treatment. There were five studies started shortly after that was publicly discussed but the results of those studies have all gone silent. Now at least two pharmaceutical companies are using tobacco plants to grow the necessary proteins for their vaccines.   </p>
