    <strong>I’m vaccinated. I feel fine.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m just genuinely trying to understand why getting vaccinated is so bad. I mean, you would get vaccinated for measles right? Not everything is just a government conspiracy that’s trying to indoctrinate you into a cult of vaccinated people. Of course you’re allowed to be suspicious of the government, but I’m just not sure why so many smart people are like this. I have a friend who’s mom isn’t letting him get vaccinated and is threatening to kick him out if he does try to get vaccinated. Why? What’s the point? I’m fine if people don’t get vaccinated, it’s just confusing why they won’t. I just want some explanation, that’s all.</p></p>

        <p>Personally, I'm waiting until these experimental bio-technologies have been tested for long term risks - and also been tested <em>properly</em> for short term risks - and when experts and doctors and even the inventor of the MRNA technology are expressing concerns about unexpected effects, I'll listen to them rather than to celebrities who sing "Get The Jab, Get The Jab, Get The Second Jab"</p>

        <p>Usually people don't have to produce evidence to prove NOT to take an 'experimental mRNA gene treatment', but the onus is upon the entities who are demanding perfectly healthy people to take it, and to prove that it is safe to take, the long term effects known, and to take liability for any damages that it may cause.</p>
<p>Please stick to this side in the future. We prove WHY to take something, not why to NOT take something.</p>

        <p>Why? Because there's an ENORMOUS amount of data proving that we do not have a pandemic. The cases that we do have amongst the old people could be prevented with cheap drugs but the government denies it and threatens everyone who tries to expose it.   </p>
<p>This is not a conspiracy, this is a fact. Now why the fuck would I trust someone with a needle full of an experimental drug that's been proven to kill test animals for a decade when we have cheap drugs that have 100% success rate vs the patogen?   </p>

        <p>Let’s apply some brain power and logical thinking to your “serious” question:</p>
<p>There are two possible answers to your question: yes and no.
1. For someone whose brain is working, they will say yes. 
2. For someone whose brain isn’t working, they will still say yes because they would lack the brain power to know their brain isn’t working.</p>
<p>Either way, you will get a yes. Therefore, casting doubt that any brain power or logical thinking went into your “serious” question in the first place.</p>

        <p>Hcq and Ivermectin. India managed to stop it within two weeks with the latter even though the WHO advised them not to use it. Why would WHO that claims to care for human lives advise a country not to use a cheap drug with almost a 100% success rate if this was about saving as many as possible? What kind of mental gymnastics do you have to do to get past that? Just curious.</p>

        <p>As far as I know India has around 1.4 billion people in it. Do you understand basic math? That death rate equals 3000 deaths in a 10 million nation. Without any medicine what so ever, in one of the least sanitary countries in the world.   </p>
<p>After Ivermectin was introduced, the pandemic was more or less over.   </p>
<p>You can write any big numbers you want. But that doesn't change the fact that you clearly can't think properly and put things into perspective. Which proves my point from my first post. You're clearly brainwashed and deep down you know it and you're trying to fight it, else you wouldn't be here.</p>

        <p>The Mask, in every single way is bullshit.</p>
<p>A 30 cent surgical Mask blocks droplets, not 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variants' and it's hard to believe that if you truly believed this was as dire a threat your life - you would probably not be relying on it to protect you.</p>
<p>The Mask functions, therefore, as a visible symbol only, a Biblical-level 'Pharisee on the street corner praying' virtue signal.</p>
<p>To others it is a trampling of their human rights, liberties and personal dignity as perfectly healthy Citizens to be FORCED to cover their mouths and block their God-given right to breathe.</p>

        <p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33592050/</p>
<p>Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<p>That’s directly from the NIH website. If ivermectin reduces Covid cases by 76%, yet vaccines are 70% ish percent (and expensive) - why aren’t we all taking ivermectin?</p>
<p>https://www.foxnews.com/media/biologist-tucker-ivermectin-effective-covid-moots-vaccine</p>
<p>Sorry for the source but it’s legit, look it up. If ivermectin is proven effective, vaccines go away, and all those corporations will be selling a .25 pill vs $500 shot to the federal government.</p>
<p>At this point you’re being willfully ignorant.</p>

        <p>Well, they didn't start using it until fairly recently, probably because of everyone rallying about how it's not effective and shouldn't be used. Information about it has been nothing but censored. Most likely because they can't squeeze maximum profit potential from an out of patent drug.</p>

        <p>A fairly large amount of “smart people” as you say are also for the vaccine. Idk why so many doctors would give out the vaccine if the think  that it’s harmful.</p>

        <p>I work near a big city hospital, 3 different doctors have told me they aren't getting the jab and have recommended none of me or my colleagues get it unless we are in a vulnerable group.</p>
<p>I've already had covid as well and 1 doctor told me it's nonsense to even consider it.</p>
<p>There was a post on here days ago showing that the majority of doctors in a large area have not taken it.</p>
<p>In the UK there was a group of doctors that came together to warn of young people getting the jab since there's no benefit other than political virtue signalling and there are now thousands of cases of heart inflammation since they have started mass vaccinating the young people for the first time.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>My point above is just that there are mixed opinions on the safety from "smart" people.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are, opinions aside, this is the most dangerous vaccine to have ever been created purely based on the huge amount of serious side effects. There have been no long term safety studies yet so no one on earth can tell you how it will effect people's health in a few years time, since we are playing with things we don't fully understand such as gene therapy.</p>
<p>So it's everyone's personal choice whether to take that risk.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I've had Covid. I have strong natural immunity, likely stronger than any jab but again we don't know. Why would I risk even a small chance of organ failure just to relax some social pressure from the vax crowd? That would make me a very weak personal and totally spineless.</p>

        <p>Why do these numbnut types keep ignoring the 'novel' and 'experimental' keywords? <br>
They just straight up ignore it. Imagine an 'experimental' 'mRNA gene treatment', now for the first time being applied WORLDWIDE where they specifically use 'test' and 'trial' in their usage...</p>
<p>Yet people act like it's been around for ever..</p>
<p>FFS. It gives our own cells instructions to produce spike proteins.. I'm sorry, My cells are sovereign, I'm not going to allow someone's 'plug and play app' (Moderna) be messing with the Operating System of my body so blindly.</p>

        <p>Circumcision is an insult to the human body, no matter what belief you come from.</p>
<p>Whether you believe you are made in God's image (and therefore an insult to remove part of the body that is made in God's image),</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>You believe you are the product of billions of years of random dice rolls, mutations, rise and falls, deaths, mutations and struggles.. and YOU made it this far.. only to again remove a part of your body that got you this far?</p>
<p>What's the question or doubt that men should remain 'intact'?</p>
<p>Any 'disgust' by people at the natural state of the body, is their mental illness, and most likely programming from birth, and the addition of copious amounts of PORN, that have brainwashed them into thinking removing an important part of the body is normal.</p>

        <p>That's great bro. I hope you never have any side effects from the v@x and live a long, healthy life. You're free to express yourself and it doesn't hurt to listen to honest dialogue (unlike NNNban).</p>
<p>The gov is pushing this too freakin hard on the population. This applies to all world Govs. That's a big red flag to me regardless of anything. Gov has never been for the people and history has proved it (Tuskegee airmen, Syphilis to Guatemalans, polio vaccines with cancer virus inside) etc. </p>
<p>The v@x isn't even FDA approved since it hasn't been tested for long term side effects. Then when people report side effects their stories are being banned or censored. Why is that? That's highly suspicious not wanting the truth to come out. Truth doesn't need propaganda for people to accept.</p>
<p>And I'm the conspiracy theorist? </p>
<p>You feel fine today. Great. I truly wish you the best bro. That's my story.</p>

        <p>It isn't an actual vaccine.  There's no evidence that spike proteins are an effective proxy for an attenuated or deactivated virus.  There's poor evidence for efficacy at all, data showing countries with &lt;5% vaccinated showing the exact same seasonal decline as those with 50-70% or more.</p>
<p>There are great risks to large doses of spike proteins spreading throughout your entire body and treatment byproducts collecting in bone marrow and ovaries.</p>
<p>Most here have nothing against properly tested vaccines.  But just as you wouldn't get either of the failed, dangerous swine flu vaccines for yourself, we don't want this experimental treatment.  And forcing medical procedures on people for someone else's benefit, while it has become trendy among the left, is up there with arch-villain levels of evil.  All for the financial benefit of big pharma that went from prime target to worshiped savior within a few scant months.</p>

        <p>Gonna assume this is in good faith...</p>
<p>You’ve probably never worked in a corporate setting. Many corporate board members are fiduciaries, they report to shareholders. They are legally obligated to turn a profit for the company at any legal cost. </p>
<p>Gonna take a leap of faith here and say Covid was created in a lab. Let’s assume it was an accident vs nefarious. In my mind this is the most likely (and rational) position to take. They did this gain of function research, knowing it was dangerous, and something bad happens.</p>
<p>If biopharma points to gain of function as the cause, guess what happens to biopharma stock? Fauci? Anyone in the top tiers of federal government that allowed this to happen? They’re all fucked, financially and professionally.</p>
<p>Understanding how the world works, these guys were trying to eradicate the disease NOT because it was so dangerous, but because they wanted to eradicate the disease. They’re trying to cover up evidence before anyone can figure it out.</p>
<p>If they waited for a traditional vaccine, no chance. Takes 5 years. Too much time, the disease will take hold and we’re living with this forever. Eventually it will be blamed on gain of function.</p>
<p>Instead they opted for mRNA vaccines, which have a much quicker turn around time. This is because they would be able to get the vaccines to market quickly to eradicate the disease. </p>
<p>On mRNA vaccines specifically, I’ve done a lot of research on it. A lot. Also am pretty knowledgeable in nanotech. </p>
<p>First, when Zika was going around, they produced a mRNA vaccine. Never gained FDA approval. You should read those studies and why it didn’t gain approval. Long short they’re unaware of long term consequences.</p>
<p>Secondly, remember when they were zapping people after administering the vaccine initially? I believe they did it in Denver first. They determined a better way to deliver the mRNA strands into your cell - a nanocoating. Per a Japanese study that came out withinv the last 6 months, that nano coating is hanging out in your brain and ovaries. No one knows what that does long term, but we all know from 7th grade health that inflammation causes cancer, and my assumption is a foreign object(s) in any one of your organs causes inflammation. </p>
<p>Also, when my friends who are younger than me start dying of heart attacks out of the blue? Not saying I’ll never get it but I’m waiting until there are serious consequences not to have it. Not afraid of Covid.</p>

        <p>Whew, this was not easy to find.</p>
<p>https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/political/national/second-us-study-for-covid-19-vaccine-uses-skin-deep-shots</p>
<p>“But after the skin-deep injection, researchers must hold a device over the spot that gives a little electrical zap. The synthetic DNA is large when it comes to penetrating human cells, and the pulse helps the vaccine more easily penetrate and get to work, Broderick said.”</p>
<p>I cannot find the actual Japanese study (suggest you read it vs take my word) but, it shows a graph where these nano particles are in high concentration specifically in brain and ovaries. Unsure why.</p>
<p>https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210607/p2g/00m/0na/002000c</p>
<p>Would have sounded paranoid a year ago but nanotech coupled with a life is extraordinarily dangerous. Nanotech in itself, I’ve always been taught they’re little machines. Unsure if it’s organic or not. Was well versed 20 years ago I’m sure the tech has changed.</p>

        <p>Sigh, this has to be a troll account. 5 minutes here and you would know the answer to your question.</p>
<ul>
<li>They lied from the start of this thing. Why would we trust them now?</li>
<li>Exaggerated tests, exaggerated death count. Use of fear &amp; propaganda to manipulate.</li>
<li>Use of censorship to stop medical workers, doctors, and scientists from being able to express dissent</li>
<li>No need for the vaccine because we are actually healthy</li>
<li>No desire for potential side effect, short term or long term</li>
<li>No fear of Covid-19. If I got it I would be asymptomatic, again, because I actually take care of my body.</li>
<li>No desire to take an experimental vaccine</li>
<li>Censorship of the vaccine side effects is incredibly suspicious</li>
<li>This isn't about a single jab, it's about a larger program to force jabs yearly, or more. Big profits, big control. Look into Covid-19 passports. Eventually this turns into a social credit system that goes beyond vaccination status. Suddenly your speech is limited and your ability to make transactions and travel from your home is limited based on your online behavior.</li>
<li>History tells us that the side that uses fear, censorship, propaganda, force, and coercion is not the good side.</li>
<li>We desire a basic right to choose what goes into our body. The other side is trying to take that away. When it comes to authoritarianism, it's never just one issue. It works incrementally. First they forced the lockdowns. Then the masks. Then the vaccines. It just grows more and more.</li>

        <p>Because it should be a personal choice. Nobody here is saying that getting vaccinated is bad. Btw this is not a conventional vaccine... Do whatever you want, couldn't care less. But why not getting vaccinated is so bad? They are pushing it way way too much to the point where soon it will be illegal to be unvaccinated. Things don't add up, especially when you consider that the survival rate is 99.9% for most healthy.  </p>
<p>The whole thing seems like a massive con and I don't want to know what is it that they're actually trying to achieve with these experimental injections. This is definitely not about our health, because if it was it would only be recommended to the old and vulnerable. No experimental jab should ever be recommended let alone forced onto the healthy person with 0 risks. This means it's about something else, and I want no part of this. </p>
<p>Also, no long term data on the side effects and short term effects seem to be pretty bad for a considerable number of people. So it's definitely not safe. Good that you feel fine now, but this is not how it works. Let's speak in a couple of years time and hopefully you're still fine., and hopefully I'm not in the covid camp :)</p>

        <p>A lot of this is true, but it’s a bit outdated. Of course it won’t completely protect you, it’s just making it less likely to get Covid. Also, more and more restrictions are being lifted because of people getting vaccinated so now I can go basically anywhere with no mask or social distancing.</p>

        <p>Why not just let some of us wait until full FDA approval with long term studies? It’s a new technology being used so some of us would rather take a 99.7% chance of recovery over an untested medical procedure that has no long term safety data yet. </p>
<p>Personally I know more people that have had issues with the vaccine than Covid itself, so I’d rather just go with the wait and see approach myself.</p>

<p>and  i wish you  a healthy life . i really wish you won't regret you decision in the next 10 year . well have nice day.</p>
