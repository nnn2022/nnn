    <strong>How do Vax Passes not violate HIPAA?</strong>
    <p><p>Every article I can find says that it doesn‚Äôt violate HIPPA because it is voluntary information. However, it seems more and more likely that vax passes and shots will be mandated pending full FDA approval. This will move it from voluntary information to personal medical information that is required to exist in ‚Äúsociety‚Äù. Wouldn‚Äôt this then violate HIPAA?</p></p>

        <p>It's essentially a loophole. The way they view it is if you want to participate in societal events and work for Uncle Sam or so on, you're willingly providing your medical information to do so as the companies and private businesses are not asking for your information, you're providing it to participate or for employment. They believe because you have the choice not to do so as you can refuse, they're not forcing you to provide your information. </p>
<p>At least, this is my understanding. Complete ü§° üåéwe're living in, sad really.</p>

        <p>This is what I was trying to convey in my post. How is it voluntary if the choice is get jabbed or get fired? Thanks for your reply!</p>

        <p>It's not, as many people rely on their jobs for income. The writing is already on the wall in that the unvaccinated will eventually be completely cut off from society at some point in the future. I could see a separated society of unvaccinated forming their own communities, probably forced off grids. Even then we will most likely still be considered a threat and targeted in some way.</p>

        <p>Check out your employment contract and the applicable laws in your state. My guess is that in the contract you signed, you didnt relinquish any rights or property to your employer. You have a right to choose and refuse medical interventions and you have a right to retain all of your private property. </p>
<p>Write an affidavit of status stating who you are and what your rights are, using the constitution, federal law, and state constitution. State that you did not relinquish any of your rights. The constitution and federal law are the supreme law of the land and anything that contradicts those laws would be held illegal in a court of record. You have to learn how to do this and do it correctly. It must be notarized and filed in your local clerk of court office</p>

        <p>Thanks for the info! I will definitely be looking into this. I personally lucked out because I am the only employee at my company other than the owner (small pest control business), and we mutually agreed to not discuss vaccination status, so no worries about losing my own job. I am more worried for those that work for large corporations, because they will lose their jobs in a heartbeat for refusing the jab.</p>

        <p>Again, same process applies to those people as well. I try to comment this as often as possible. No person, corporation, agency, or representative of one has rights over your body. Unless you entered a contract relinquishing those rights, you cannot be compelled to do anything you dont want to do. Using the existing law, affidavits as a sworn oath declaring that you reserve all of your god-given rights will have legal standing unless they are re-butted point for point.</p>

        <p>&rt;seems more and more likely that vax passes and shots will be mandated pending full FDA approval.</p>
<p>I wouldn't count on that... there's a lot of legal back and forth behind the scenes on this question. If employers could get away scot free mandating it, they would have by now. FDA approval would not limit them from liability if an injury occurred. If FDA approval truly is on the horizon, then i would expect big firms to know that already and essentially mandate it now. Does it matter if they get sued between now and FDA approval? Not really. Look at CNN's vaccination "mandate" .. its all an honor system. The people who were fired proclaimed they were unvaccinated. That was <strong>done for a reason.</strong> Employers are on shaky ground for mandating the vaccine -- cities and state legislatures are on much more solid legal footing (even if i disagree with the precedent). Its highly likely the NYC vaccine passport <strong>would stand in court</strong> <strong>unless the Supreme Court overturns/narrows Jacobson v Massachusetts.</strong> Justice Gorsuch has already eluded to the need to narrow Jacobson, but until that happens its the standing precedent as the Circuit courts interpret it.</p>
<p>The HIPAA argument is a legal loophole -- "well we aren't requiring you to disclose anything, you're just providing it to participate"</p>
<p>HIPAA was written to limit employers being able to dig into employees private life: the intent of the statute was to prevent an employer from hiring and firing based on information that does not matter and is not their business. HIPAA doesn't mean that an employer is entitled to pretty much know everything about you if you disclosure it, HIPAA is written to ensure that an employee will never be put in a situation to where they would have an adverse hiring decision based on a health situation.</p>
<p>A legal analog to this would be requiring to disclose if you intend to get pregnant in the next 12 months in order to interview for a job. Would 'well, if you aren't comfortable answering if you intend to start a family -- don't bother coming for an interview' be a sufficient defense for asking that? Of course not, its a <strong>grammatical circumlocution cloaked in purported sophistication to arrive at essentially the exact same answer.</strong> There is a 'right' answer and a 'wrong' answer. The vaccine question would be exactly the same.</p>
<p>The interesting part here is that Jacobson wouldn't even apply in this scenario, as the authority to legislate vaccination under Jacobson is interpreted to be a <strong><em>plenary power for the state legislatures</em></strong> <em>...</em> so its also possible that the court limits the ability to track vaccination status <em>only to public entities at the state level</em> .. which would make sense. Companies don't get to ask you if you've received your entire regime of booster shots through primary school, i dont see this as being any different.</p>

        <p>Only health care is bound by HIPAA. That is the simplest answer. Read on for more info and examples.</p>
<p>It basically means your health care providers will protect the privacy of your medical records and give you access to them if you want them. You likely, via signature, give them permission to share with certain entities like your insurance and primary care physician as well.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping businesses from asking you directly or you from voluntarily sharing the information. While you are likely thinking "this is not voluntary," it still doesn't violate HIPAA because your health care provider played no role in this.</p>
<p>If a restaurant asks you if you are vaccinated and you respond, HIPAA is not involved.</p>
<p>If the restaurant called your doctor and your doctor told them you weren't vaccinated, that would violate HIPAA.</p>
<p>If that restaurant then shared it with an agency doing outreach to unvaccinated people, that does not violate HIPAA. I'm sure it violates something though...</p>

<p>I mean, it's all screwed up, but not a HIPAA violation. When people start screaming that it is, it honestly kind of makes us all look stupid.</p>

        <p>I feel the same. That's why I always take the time to explain it thoroughly. We need as many people on our side making valid arguments out in the world.</p>
<p>The scariest part, really, is that it is done in a way where there is no agency, precedent, or law to protect you.</p>
