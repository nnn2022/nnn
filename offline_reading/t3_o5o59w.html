    <strong>Examining the evidence. Government and big Pharma aren’t right because they say they’re right</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m taking a class right called “critical thinking and logic”. I’m on a portion of the class about examining evidence. It’s interesting because it states that</p>
<p>1)  “researchers’ values, self interest, and biases can skew the way they conduct research and interpret findings. </p>
<p>2) authority can be mistaken. Authority often has bias or an agenda </p>
<p>It goes on and on about evidence and the summery of it all is that just because shrilled big Pharma scientist or powerful government leader or some popular actor says it’s true doesn’t mean it’s accurate. Evidence is non biased and can be interpreted in different ways. This class just reminds me so much of how corrupt everything has become from Covid and how many people believe in false or skewed evidence</p></p>

        <p>I couldn’t imagine. We cover a little bit of statistics in this class. It makes me sad that people can’t wake up and formulate their own beliefs. It’s like they say “daddy government, what should I believe?”</p>

        <p>The first thing you learn in statistics is that the data can say whatever you want it to.</p>

        <p>If we were looking at new groundbreaking quantum physics, then yeah, most would have to rely on the experts to interpret it. Those guys are IQ 160+ and takes years to peer review just one result. It's insane.</p>
<p>Viral spread, hospitalisation, death and vaccine stats are pretty easy to interpret. The maths isn't exactly hard, and you can read past papers and books to know how to interpret these numbers.</p>
<p>My frustration is the hypocrisy.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>"Deaths from Covid is mostly old and already ill, the numbers are massively overestimated. Old and very ill people do die often"</p>
<p>This statement is met with being a conspiracy and not following the science.</p>
<p>Yet replace "Covid" with "Vaccine" and that is the argument people are using for the swathe of adverse effects and deaths after vaccine.</p>
<p>They then argue the reason it isn't hypocritical is that Covid kill and Vaccines don't.</p>
<p>My issue with this is that is an assertion, and the evidence is self supporting/circular, not externally validated.</p>
<p>The argument of "But are you a Doctor/Epidemiologist/Scientist" etc is a poor one when it comes to a particular level of data. </p>
<p>Most critical thinkers and anyone with good Honours Advanced Placement in maths will be able to accurately use the data. The conclusions should be based on statistical principles.</p>
<p>Most papers state the stats used, and anyone with a brain can source a statistics book which can show you in absolute detail how to process the data.</p>
<p>Hell, I have a science degree and higher degree, and 95% of my learning was SELF research and self learning.</p>
<p>Lecturers admit this. They state most learning and work should be branching outside the simple reading recommendations.</p>
<p>Most scientists/doctors etc are always learning and learn most from papers etc.</p>
<p>The idea that "experts" have this forbidden unreachable knowledge or capability is fucking stupid.</p>
<p>I have seen some very stupid doctorates, and some very clever carpenters.</p>
