    <strong>Vax &amp; Trump?</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else find it weird that trump was one of the first people to be vaccinated? I got mine because he did, but I regret it now because who knows what’s in it… I feel like he led us wrong :( it’s upsetting me.</p></p>

        <p>This is the difference between a Trump supporter and a Trump voter. I voted for him, but I do not support all of his actions. I was especially skeptical of the whole “operation warp speed” thing. I’m not sure he really “led us wrong”, at least not intentionally. I believe, at the time covid hit, he did not know of it’s origins. I think he was acting in the country’s best interests. I believe he became aware of the truth regarding covid around a month or so before the election, when the controversy surrounding ‘mail-in ballots’ became a thing. It was at that time that I suspect he knew, as I did, that there was going to be massive voter fraud by dems, and the election would be stolen by them for Biden.</p>

        <p>If you know about all the shit going on in the background with his staffers and advisors backstabbing him I wouldn't be surprised if he was fed bullshit information about the vaccines.</p>

        <p>If you should get the pneumonia vaccine, you should get a COVID vaccine. Trump is old and fat. He needs both. Are you old and fat? Then you need both too. If you aren't, then you need to take responsibility for your own actions and not blame him</p>

        <p>I doubt Trump even got it but why would you base your healthcare decisions on what he or any other politician does?  They are all bullshit artists.</p>

        <p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html?s_cid=10492:covid%20vaccine%20ingredients:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21</p>
<p>You can find out all you want to know about what's in each brand of the vaccine. Scroll down to the "what are the ingredients" section, select the brand you received, then under General Information there is a link to see the full list of ingredients. I'm not educated enough to know what each ingredient is or does, but you can always look them up individually. I don't think there's any reason to be afraid of the vaccine, or to regret having received it. Potential for serious negative side effects is low, and the benefit to yourself, and others, is very high. The sooner we get everyone vaccinated, the sooner we can stop worrying about wearing masks and having quarantines, and then get back to normal.</p>
