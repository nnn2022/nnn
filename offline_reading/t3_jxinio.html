        <p>Unrelated in the sense that my reasoning for not liking both aren’t similar. I’ve never once thought damn I hate condoms so I won’t wear a mask. Both condoms and masks can still cause infectious diseases. I personally feel that a masks ability to help curb ones risk to Covid is minimal.</p>

        <p>Oh I thought you were saying the comparison was unrelated, not your rationale. My bad. </p>
<p>And agreed about the efficacy comparison to condoms and masks, but I think (and stick with me here, it's gonna be a wild ride) you boned everyone that you passed on the street and every passerby in a store, even a condom that offered a 50% reduction in transmission would prevent a cascade effect.</p>

        <p>I mean, that was in the good ol days where we also thought we could blood let any disease away. Point is, we were pretty ignorant back then to science, and I'm sure if there was an effective prevention/treatment/cure, maybe they wouldnt have just tried to hide it and actually done something about it?</p>

        <p>A condom is a minor inconvenience that doesn’t change too much on my end. It’s not as good as without, but it’s still good. A mask really fucks me up, I have asthma and PTSD and the masks give me breathing issues and panic attacks, and the combo is not good. It’s incredibly invasive and medically harmful to me. </p>
<p>When I ask a guy to put a condom on, I’m giving him a choice-either wear it or don’t sleep with me. I’m not forcing him to wear it no matter what, whether he wants to or not-ultimately it’s his choice. And I know what your next argument will be “isn’t this the same as a store saying wear a mask or don’t come in?” And no, it’s not. Not sleeping with one person isn’t “life”, it’s one minor little sucky event. Not being allowed entry into basically anywhere other than your home is something insanely huge and life altering.</p>
<p>Also, I have researched and I am far more likely to get an STI than die from covid. In fact, I’d say if I sleep with a decent amount of people unprotected, it’s likely I’ll get something. It’s not likely in the least that I’ll die of covid. I am doing what I need to based on my perceived risk and not forcing anyone else to do something because of that.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the sincere reply here, and you were one step ahead lol </p>
<p>Would you say that having the option for pick-up/delivery for things like normal goods and groceries makes that distinction more gray in nature? I find that during the past few months, my only outings have really been groceries, normal errands, and exercise, which can all be done "contactless". So not being able to physically go in buildings wouldn't quite exclude you from the necessities, right?</p>

        <p>Haha I try, I’m pretty good at cross examining in my head before I post anything, I like to be thorough upfront. </p>
<p>I don’t consider it a grey area at all to be honest. To me these are not “equal opportunities”. In the past, those with disabilities were always promised equal opportunities to live like others, and suddenly that isn’t happening. Not getting to shop and go out and do things isn’t equal. Life isn’t sitting in my house getting deliveries, life is going out and experiencing things. This ranges from things as small as going to get my groceries to big things like going on dream vacations. Humans weren’t made to sit isolated in one location for long periods of time. More power to those who have been able to do so but I am not that kind of person, for my own mental health I need to be out and about and “social”, even if that socialization is just being around others while shopping.  Humans are by nature social creatures, take that away and many of us are going to have a mental health crisis. I was borderline suicidal during lockdown and know many others who were the same. Delivery/pickup is just an extension of staying home doing nothing.  Life isn’t made to be lived never leaving one’s car/house. </p>
<p>I also just have a problem with it because I like to pick my own things. I want to go browse for clothes or browse around the grocery store to find new ideas. I like to pick my own produce. And I also have an ethical problem with it-for those of us with medical reasons we can’t wear masks, why should we have to lose our lives due to something completely out of our control that we didn’t ask for? Why should I have to be the one that stays home while you get to shop and live your life? If you’re so scared of one person without a mask staying distanced from you while they shop why aren’t you staying home yourself?</p>

        <p>Just homemade condoms. Experts say they are as effective at preventing STD's as homemade masks are for preventing the spread of covid.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the health of my penis is more important to me than your health or anyone elses. In fact, if I was told I needed to have both my legs amputed or have my penis removed I'm going to need a wheelchair because the legs are gone.</p>
<p>The fact that you believe that is a legitimate question is an example of the stupidity pushing masks. Do you close your eyes while driving? Do you hold your breath under water? Do you wear your mask while having sex?</p>

        <p>I'd say they're both forms of preventative healthcare, but that's about as far as it goes.</p>
<p>Masks, if worn properly, might keep you safe from a virus in which if you even catch it in the first place, you have a ridiculously high chance of survival and not even being legitimately harmed from it. Especially if you're a generally healthy person.</p>
<p>Condoms, if worn properly, strongly help prevent pregnancies in addition to essentially outright preventing incureable diseases and infections that can have severe effects on your health and lead to death, regardless of your age or personal health.</p>
<p>But, I think that if people want to not wear condoms, they can feel free. Just like people who want to not wear masks should be able to feel free. So if somebody wants their partner to wear a condom, but that partner doesn't, they shouldn't have sex together. Just like if some people want others to wear masks, but others don't, they shouldn't interact with each other. If someone is so afraid of catching the virus (STDs), they can wear a mask (condom) or just not have sex (not go out in public).</p>
<p>Yet one of these things is mandated by several governments and one isn't whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Alrighty, I'll play along. So I can take the chance to catch an incurable STI by not wearing a condom, or to not wear a mask and possibly risk catching a cold virus with a 99.8% survival rate? </p>
<p>You know people who wear masks can still get covid, right? It isn't some magical talisman that wards off the virus. Whereas a condom is virtually 100% effective at preventing STI's, lockdowns and masks do not offer 100% prevention of covid. This is a ridiculous premise.</p>

        <p>The risk of transmitting covid with good hygiene and two-party mask wearing is actually pretty slim. Much like condoms, when used properly, have slim chances of passing disease or allowing pregnancy. </p>
<p>I think the scale and severity is different of course, but wouldn't say ridiculous. Simply a thought experiment.</p>
