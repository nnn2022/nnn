    <strong>To go on the camp: mandatory vax or negative test</strong>
    <p><p>I'm seriously debating here.<br>
My Choir  (all grown ups) has a camp each year together. Lot's of fun, lots of alcohol and singing and wacky games and trips. Last year's was scrapped of course (which is bullshit but old news now).  </p>
<p>For this year's camp they decided that with the alcohol consumption and cramped  sleeping location it wont be realistic to keep 1,5 meter distance. So they have set it that we need to either be double vaxxed or have  a recent negative test. Many of the choir members work in the medical field so are pretty paranoid/gung-ho about this whole covid-schtick. They just decided they wanted this. </p>
<p>The Government isnt making them set this rule. The building we hire is a Scouting building, but since we are not scouting the rules that Scouts over age 18 have to keep distance does not apply. And according to the government large events must require either a negative test or double vaxx proof. But we are not a big event either so that doenst apply. Legally speaking I'd be fine, but I strongly suspect that if i refuse the doctor-members of the choir will not allow me to come.  They're just virtue signaling and fear-porn spreading basically. </p>
<p>And now I'm genuinely torn on whether to submit to getting tested. Getting vaxxed isnt even an glimmer of an option obviously. I've never been tested before and wasnt planning on ever getting tested. But I really really wanna  go, so I'm leaning towards just getting tested. But I also know myself as being all about the principle of the matter. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The camp is in 20 days so I still have some time to decide. I've never been tested before and am told it is ... unpleasant. (I'm a bit of a baby anyway with being poked and prodded medically and a q-tip up the nasal passages sounds... awful). </p>
<p>I'm considering taking an at-home test in advance. There's a decent chance I could be positive since i kinda have the sniffles now.  If the self-test comes out positive I think i might get tested. Cause a negative test is basically worthless for me. Those are only good for 2 days. But if you've had covid within the last 6 months you are considered "immune" which would be a beneficial thing to officially have on my record. If I turn out positive and they call me for contact tracing Imma just hang up, nothing they can do. </p>
<p>But then again a little voice in my brain is saying why would i want anything on record. Why would i ever want to give them my information. It's not their business. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>this is how they get you...</p>
<p>I couldnt care less about not being able to go on holiday to Germany or going to Disney or whatever. I've been to both dozens of times by now. I dont care about going to festivals and themeparks and clubs and  shit that much either i was never a party girl. <br>
But somehow not being able to go on this camp is hitting me hard and I think I'm gonna cave in and just submit to the fucking test.</p>
<p>But i kinda hate myself for it...</p>
<p>Not really asking for advice I think  but opinions are welcome</p></p>

        <p>Just have to ask yourself if you’re willing to die on this hill. I dont think you should beat yourself up over it if you decide to take a test. Hell, i guarantee those people will break every protocol while on the trip and im willing to bet theyve been breaking them this whole time.</p>

<p>I really hope you are right but some of these guys/gals are doctors like i said. and pretty "holier-than-thou"covid cultists. <br>
So I hópe you are right but I think you are wrong.</p>
<p>I do think that while on the trip they will genuinely let all other mandates/rules/protocols go. The mandatory vax/test will hopefully fulfill their virtue signaling crave.</p>

        <p>The mouth swab test I was offered detects any history of covid, and it's just a self-administered saliva test, not even to the back of the throat. Your decision of the home test first is a smart idea. I would call around to find a clinic or pop-up site that offers the saliva swab.</p>

        <p>This is frustrating. A lot of people are going to have to make choices like this for the rest of the year. 
It's up to you. If you really want to go, get a COVID test. The vaccine can do some irreversible damage to your body.</p>
