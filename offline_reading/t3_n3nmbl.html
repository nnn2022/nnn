        <p>The US death toll from covid is nearly 200 times more than the death toll on 9/11. It's also rapidly approaching the death toll of the civil war, and we will almost certainly surpass it before the pandemic has ended.</p>

        <p>What's your point? All of these are causes of mass death and most people do a great deal to mitigate or prevent them, why is this pandemic any different? I'm not even the one who brought up the civil war in the first place, but even if it's death toll is proportionally more severe doesn't mean we should ignore something else. The pandemic is still the greatest cause of mass death in generations, as expressed in the post, ignoring it would be foolish.</p>

        <p>The government also doesn't enforce that you wear a mask outside, this is a false equivalency. The post is about whether or not you should be upset with someone over their personal choice to wear a mask, why are you even making comparisons about what the government enforces?</p>

        <p>Do you understand the psychological issues with seeing people wearing masks and how it dehumanizes them? I’m asking if you are advocating a world where people are dehumanized and put into groups of outcasts based on arbitrary “scientific” excuses? Not trying to put it words in your mouth? Simply asking which side of said issue you stand on.</p>

        <p>I actually don't understand the "psychological issues" you're talking about, and I'm genuinely curious if you have some sort of verifiable basis for this claim. I see people with masks on nearly every day and I don't think of them as any less human. I have no interest in outcasting anyone based on arbitrary information, and I don't want to put words into your mouth either, so I'd just like to know which "scientific excuses" you find to be so arbitrary?</p>

        <p>There have been no randomized studies where the collectors of data are blind to what is being assigned the subjects (obviously you cannot blind the mask wearers vs non-mask because they will know which they are). Vitamin D is much more effective based on the types of studies actually used.</p>
<p>Much of the same flawed study methods were used on vaccines, they rushed to give the placebo group access to vaccines far before the study concluded and they never released copies of directions provided to participants on when they should report potential symptoms of the vaccine and/or virus. The only reason they wouldn’t make this public is if their instructions were designed in a way to make reporting of said adverse events biased to benefit the vaccine results in efficacy, as they have been criticized for doing in the past and no reason to trust them this time as a result.</p>
<p>Plenty of studies on how masks dehumanizes people. Look at toddler development and reaction to faces all of the way to how people often have face coverings when executed.</p>

        <p>Ok, I was not aware that there has not been randomized control trials, but your explanation seems to make sense, so I'll take your word for it. You do know that there are other ways of determining information though, right? There have been plenty of studies on the efficacy of masks that confirm that they work, like <a href="https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf">this</a> one for example, from about a year ago, when a lot of information was still being uncovered.</p>

<p>&rt; they rushed to give the placebo group access to vaccines far before the study concluded and they never released copies of directions provided to participants </p>
<p>It sounds like you are referencing a particular study here. Do you have a link to it so I could take a closer look? I'd be interested to see the flaws you're describing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Look at toddler development and reaction to faces all of the way to how people often have face coverings when executed. </p>
<p>This is where you've really lost me, I'm afraid. The psychological/neurological development of toddlers is so far removed from what we're talking about here. I could see a case for the idea that toddlers develop different social skills with/without masks present, but that's a far cry from "a world where people are dehumanized and put into groups of outcasts." Masks used in executions certainly have nothing to do with preventing the spread of disease, and bear very little similarity to the types of masks being used right now. So in terms of the "psychological issues" I don't see much support for your argument.</p>

        <p>I’m too lazy to lookup references for everything I have said because it always feels like similar things happen in any discussion and almost all of these can even be found on google. How fucked up is it that basically all the vaccine companies are doing it to mask the long term issues, not just one?</p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/02/19/969143015/long-term-studies-of-covid-19-vaccines-hurt-by-placebo-recipients-getting-immuni</p>
<p>Here’s one from the Mayo Clinic showing just how biased they are with their criticism of vitamin D by saying other studies on other diseases say it doesn’t work even though the one on COVID does, so we’re not going to trust it. Wish they held those same standards on vaccines and masks.</p>
<p>https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/expert-answers/coronavirus-and-vitamin-d/faq-20493088</p>
<p>If there’s a specific thing you really want to know about, I’ll help with that, but otherwise I will let you do most of the research on your own after this. Shouldn’t be hard to find now that you know.</p>
<p>Masks for executions are about making the executioner not feel bad about killing a person, just like drone strikes, and gas chambers. Focus instead on understanding why faces are important in Psychology for development of people as well as how we form relationships with others and are better able to relate to them in various situations. Even the fucked up backward think of some doctors printing pictures of their faces on their masks have meaning in that sense, they are not empty gestures, just a very backward way to handle the problem.</p>

        <p>This NPR article you linked is about how a vaccine study lost its placebo group because the vaccines became available under EUA during the trial, and the vast majority of the people chose to get vaccinated instead of continuing in the placebo group. This is an unfortunate loss of valuable research, but I fail to see how this is evidence of vaccine companies "masking the long term issues." The FDA chose to authorize these vaccines for use after determining that they were safe through other studies and trials, including <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728?id=C4591001&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">this RCT</a>, which had enough data in December 2020 to satisfy the requirements for EUA. The study from your NPR article was still ongoing at that time, and was unfortunately interrupted. This outcome does not change the fact that the vaccines were determined to be safe independently of this trial.</p>
<p>As for this Mayo Clinic post, it doesn't sound much like a criticism of vitamin D to me. The answer given clearly acknowledges that some studies have shown a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and infection, but concluded that there is not enough research to recommend it as a treatment. There may be more useful information to be uncovered here, but it sounds like that research is still underway. So if we're in a situation where masks are proven to be at least somewhat effective, but vitamin D is still inconclusive, what's the issue with recommending masks instead of vitamin D?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Masks for executions are about making the executioner not feel bad about killing a person </p>
<p>I understand what you're getting at here, but we're talking about a very different kind of mask, and we're not executing people. </p>
<p>&rt; faces are important in Psychology for development of people as well as how we form relationships with others </p>
<p>I agree with you here, and I think that the widespread use of masks in public probably has a small negative effect on the way people interact with each other. However, I don't believe the effect is anywhere close to "dehumanizing and outcasting people" as you originally claimed, and its far outweighed by the positive effect of keeping people safe.</p>

        <p>Okay, it is an unfortunate loss of valuable data resulting in me being unable to trust these vaccines until they manage to take the appropriate actions to now get this valuable data that is pretty much the only way I can every trust it. It’s funny how all of these important areas where data could provide real evidence for or against something suddenly have similar unfortunate losses of data, the sole exception being Vitamin D.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of other research on Vitamin D, which I am sure you can lookup. You can choose to downplay the dehumanizing effects of masks, but it’s really a moot point if you’re doing a cost-benefit analysis and we have no solid evidence that masks work. The little evidence that does exist is extremely flimsy, as compared to vitamin D which is solid. Then when you look at the real world data you find absolutely no correlation between mask wearing and prevention of cases. Obviously it’s a bit harder to analyze since there are so many confounding variables, but that only strengthens the argument for controlled trials, which never happen yet people feel the need to violate my first amendment rights of assembly and association based on a bunch of public servants eyeballing a situation and saying looks good to me.</p>
<p>Why are we doing shit like mask mandates instead of vitamin D mandates for all vitamin D deficient and diet mandates for those that are morbidly obese? Trust me, I’m not going to bother finding a source, but I am sure you can find them yourself, morbidly obese people are much much more likely to die from this or take up healthcare resources than other people. It can also be resolved by diet change. This is all just basic science. Of course I believe in selfish things like freedom and human rights, so think coercing someone to take a vaccine, or any medical treatment, is evil. I also think forcing people to act a specific way, even if it is claimed to be for the benefit of themself or society, is evil. This is especially true when they do not even have the evidence to support it, for whatever excuse given that results in them failing to acquire it.</p>

        <p>&rt;it is an unfortunate loss of valuable data resulting in me being unable to trust these vaccines </p>
<p>You don't trust what exactly? That they're safe and effective? I think the trial I linked to you shows pretty clearly that they are. If you're worried about long term side effects, I honestly think that's a very legitimate concern, because the research is still in progress at this point. However, Covid most certainly has serious long term side effects, up to and including death, and also carries the risk of infecting others, leading to more sickness and death, prolonging the pandemic, and even a small chance of creating a new variant which could potentially set us back to square one. So you need to weigh the risks here, and I personally think the balance falls in favor of vaccines.</p>
<p>As far as vitamin D goes, I was not aware before our conversation that there is some evidence to suggest it protects against covid, so I'd like to thank you for exposing me to that information. I came across <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vitamin-d-covid-study">this article</a> referencing a study that found a link, and concluded that " randomized clinical trials are needed" as well as <a href="https://chess.uchicago.edu/vitd/">this study</a> which started recently and aims to find more evidence to support that idea. If the research find a strong cause and effect, then I would support any kind of advisement that the general population take vitamin D supplements, in the same way that I support advisement that the general population wear masks. As much as you may dislike hearing it from me, there is plenty of research to support the idea that masks work:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118">An evidence review of face masks against COVID-19</a></p>
<p>&rt; Our review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use as source control to reduce community transmission </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001868621000762#s0090">Face masks against COVID-19: Standards, efficacy, testing and decontamination methods</a></p>
<p>&rt; The effectiveness of masks in population-wide scenarios has been proven to be significant </p>
<p>There's plenty more, but I'm sure you can google as well as I can.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; violate my first amendment rights of assembly and association </p>
<p>Your first amendment rights have not been violated. There is no federal law requiring you to wear a mask in the vast majority of situations. The exceptions, to my understanding, are that federal employees and contractors must wear masks at work, and the public must wear masks on public transportation. All other mask requirements are either a non legally binding advisement, or a requirement made by a private company within their own property.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; morbidly obese people are much much more likely to die from this or take up healthcare resources than other people </p>
<p>I agree 100%. This country has a major problem with obesity, and it's exacerbating the covid problem. We should take serious steps to address both these issues.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; coercing someone to take a vaccine, or any medical treatment, is evil </p>
<p>The general public is not being required to take any vaccine. There is only an advisement.</p>

        <p>The problem with everything you are citing is the same, all of those are using the loophole of not having randomized trials with a controlled placebo group. The vaccine studies threw away their placebo groups and since these are the same companies that have literally paid settlements in the past for lying about how they did their clinical trials, not a chance I am giving them the benefit of the doubt. If they had always been honest in the past, and were now open with how they conducted their trials instead of hiding the instructions given to the participants, I would give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Given that Vitamin D already has more evidence, even in some very small randomized double blind placebo controlled studies, than the effectiveness of either the vaccines or masks, I will continue to take vitamin D and not concern myself with the trivialities of the others.</p>
<p>This is particularly true because the others have potential for much more severe side effects and even if they may work, the effectiveness is likely significantly reduced when used at the same time as the others. For example since Vitamin D reduces severe COVID by 97% of cases, and the vaccine claims to do it by about 94%, this would not result in me having a reduction in risk of 1-.97*.94, probably more like 98% instead of 97%, but obviously no studies on how they work together because that would demonstrate the general worthlessness of the vaccines, and we can’t have that.</p>
<p>Ask yourself why we have placebo groups and randomization in studies, the answer is simple, without them it is hardly better than blind guessing. So what I am saying is that anyone who understands statistics agrees, the mask studies are all shit, because they do not follow any of the important practices when trying to demonstrate causality. More importantly, empirical data on the locations with these different policies do not yield any meaningful patterns, further suggesting the need for actual studies instead of these half-assed ones.</p>
<p>The moment you say the exceptions when talking about freedoms like assembly and/or association, the burden of proof needs to be extremely high. Like you need to PROVE my walking around is directly responsible for the death of that grandma standing next to me, who also decided to leave the safety of her own home of her own volition and through no actions of my own. It starts with one area, but there is no reason that is where things are going to stop, there’s a reason people are debating vaccine passports.</p>
<p>Long before we ever get to vaccine passports or mask mandates, they better be doing test of people for morbid obesity and vitamin D deficiency because those things have much more evidence than anything you have provided on masks or vaccines.</p>
<p>Before you tell me how it’s not required, I live in China right now and if I want to fly home the idiots on the plane are going to force me to wear a mask before and after I eat my meals. These companies (airlines from the US anyway) have been given monopoly exempt status by the US government, so by doing this they are violating my first amendment rights. I have no reasonable alternative method of transportation to the US.</p>
<p>By the way, just like how the masks and vaccine usage does not bear out when looking at empirical data with coronavirus cases and deaths of various states/countries/regions, both obesity and vitamin D DO bear this out. This means that the 2 factors going through rigorous testing can be seen in the real world while the 2 factors that have not gone through the rigorous testing that statistical analysis would require of them are not observed. This is why good statistical practices matter. Even still, I do not believe in forcing people to take vitamin D or changing their diet to not be morbidly obese, I just find it amazingly hypocritical that the other 2 are being forced on people when these 2 are not.</p>

        <p>&rt;The problem with everything you are citing is the same, all of those are using the loophole of not having randomized trials</p>
<p>You said yourself that RCTs for masks are not possible, but again they're not the only way of doing studies, and there are plenty of reputable studies on the efficacy of masks. You can't just write them all off just because they don't meet your impossible criteria. Also, there <strong>ARE</strong> RCTs for the vaccines, I just linked you one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Vitamin D reduces severe COVID by 97% of cases </p>
<p>By this do you mean that 97% of covid cases among people why have sufficient vitamin D are not categorized as severe? There is a huge difference between reducing the severity of positive cases, and reducing the chance of infection altogether. The 2 major mRNA vaccines have about a 95% effectiveness in preventing any infection at all. I am very skeptical of the idea that sufficient vitamin D prevents 97% of infections.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; the mask studies are all shit, because they do not follow any of the important practices when trying to demonstrate causality </p>
<p>RCTs don't even prove causality on their own. No trial can prove it without an examination and understanding of the cause and effect factors. We do thoroughly understand these factors when it comes to airborne disease transmission and mask filtration. RCTs are one of the best ways of reducing bias and establishing strong correlation, but when they are not possible, like in this case, we do the next best thing. Again, you cannot write off proper and thorough studies just because they don't meet your impossible criteria.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; the burden of proof needs to be extremely high. Like you need to PROVE my walking around is directly responsible for the death...</p>
<p>You're absolutely right, the burden of proof to write a mask mandate law is and should be extremely high. We do not have a mask mandate law, we have advisements. None of it is legally enforceable, the only legal repercussions are refusal of service and potentially loss of a government contract. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  These companies (airlines from the US anyway) have been given monopoly exempt status by the US government, so by doing this they are violating my first amendment rights. </p>
<p>You don't have a constitutional right to fly on a plane. Monopoly exempt status, regardless of your opinion on it, does not change the fact that airlines are private companies which can refuse service for any reason. The government is under no obligation to provide you with transportation, and if it does choose to provide transportation, it can set whatever conditions it finds appropriate. I am genuinely sorry if you feel like you're trapped in another country, though.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; the masks and vaccine usage does not bear out when looking at empirical data with coronavirus cases and deaths of various states/countries/regions</p>
<p>I am sure that this research is currently being conducted, and it will be some time before we see thorough analytical papers on these effects, but I wanted to show you that there is at least some information currently available. I chose <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/new-york?view=daily-deaths&amp;tab=trend">New York</a> and <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/florida?view=mask-use&amp;tab=trend">Florida</a> as two US states with similar population but very different approaches to the pandemic. New York has more mask use, more social distancing, fewer infections, and fewer deaths when compared to Florida. New York has also vaccinated a higher percentage of its population, as you can see <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">here</a>. I know a lot of this data is imperfect, but there is at least strong evidence in favor of mask use and vaccination in this empirical data. I don't doubt what you're saying about obesity and vitamin D, but I think advisements on those topics should be made in conjunction with advisements on mask use and vaccination.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I do not believe in forcing people to take vitamin D or changing their diet to not be morbidly obese, I just find it amazingly hypocritical that the other 2 are being forced on people when these 2 are not. </p>
<p>I agree, none of these things should be forced on people. Lucky for us, none of them are. As I said above, the only mask "mandates" are advisements, and private companies. If any "vaccine passport" requirements come into widespread usage, they will have to fit into one of those two categories, or they will surely be shot down in court. Nobody is forcing anyone to do either of these.</p>

        <p>You cannot do placebo studies with masks, you can still randomly assign people masks to wear and choose how much exposure to the virus they get to determine the effectiveness.</p>
<p>Of course I do not have a right to fly on an airplane, the Bill of Rights is about negative rights. I simply have the right to not be denied flying on an airplane for choosing to wear a mask. I am obviously not entitled to a free ticket. It’s really disturbing that you think that is not what the Bill of Rights is about and you think that it’s acceptable to force people to wear masks on a government mandated cartel. The fact that they are government mandated IS what makes them subject to the US Constitution, even if they are a private company. You cannot feel genuinely sorry for me if you are so cold as to say that it doesn’t matter. You have even admitted now that there isn’t any real evidence for masks, just that they meet some arbitrary standard of they did good enough in their research given the constraints.</p>
<p>I’m so glad you chose NY and FL, but wow, you are getting some bad sources. NY has 2715 deaths per 1 million pop while FL has 1653 deaths per 1 million pop, so how could that possibly make NY better? Also, cases are 108,455 NY and 104,943 FL. I used worldmeters.info.</p>
<p>They are literally forcing masks on airplanes, so don’t tell me they are not forcing them. How is it that you do not understand this simple fact? You will be kicked off the airplane if you do not wear a mask, an airplane that is protected by US law from having competition.</p>
<p>I would also be willing to volunteer for a study where I am randomly assigned a mask or no mask while exposed to a random amount of the virus as set in the parameters of such a clinical study for the purposes of science.</p>

<p>You must understand the ethical problems with purposefully exposing people to the virus, not to mention the difficulty getting volunteers if that's what you're doing. It's brave of you to say that you would volunteer, but no ethical researcher would do this, no research group would fund it, and virtually nobody would participate. This type of trial is not viable, the types that have been done are viable and sufficient. The only reason you've provided why the current studies are insufficient is that they aren't RCTs. RCT is not the only way to do a good study.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I simply have the right to not be denied flying on an airplane for choosing to wear a mask </p>
<p>You do not have this right. Any private business can refuse service to any person for any reason, government mandate or not. If it was unconstitutional, why hasn't it been outlawed?</p>
<p>I also use worldometers.info. The links I sent you are the projection graphs for those states used by that same site. The numbers I referenced are the <strong>current</strong> daily infections and deaths, not totals. New York has higher total deaths because it was one of the earliest major outbreak centers, and experienced a major spike in January. Despite that, New York is <strong>currently</strong> experiencing fewer daily infections and deaths compared to Florida. I attribute that to more masks, more social distancing, and more vaccines. I'm sorry that I was unclear in my last response, but this is what I meant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; They are literally forcing masks on airplanes, so don’t tell me they are not forcing them. </p>

<p>&rt; You cannot feel genuinely sorry for me if you are so cold as to say that it doesn’t matter. </p>
<p>I do actually. I know it's easy to forget this when people disagree so much, but I am a human being with empathy. I've been away from friends and family for extended periods of time before, and it's tough. I'm sure you must feel like the world is against you in all this, and I'm sorry for that. Despite our differences, I don't wish you any ill will.</p>

        <p>It’s a tremendous hurdle, but they are doing it now and I look forward to the results because it will be one of the few pieces of data I feel can be trusted.</p>
<p>https://time.com/5940335/uk-challenge-trial-covid-19/</p>
<p>In the US I do have the right, it’s the first amendment, but no point in trying to explain that further at this point.</p>
<p>The fact that you think current levels matters more than the overall number is really really weird. Viruses always spread in cycles through populations with ebbs and flows. It is only once it has finished burning through the population in combination with vaccines, that we can really say who was better off. What you sited is completely irrelevant for this reason, just think, what if FL has more issues than NY now because all the old people in NY died in 2020 because Cuomo forced sick people into nursing homes, but the people in FL are just getting sick and dying now because FL managed to delay it, but the inevitable finally came? How is this not a more reasonable explanation than masks?</p>
<p>Glad you don’t wish me any will, and likewise same to you, which is why I would strongly recommend you take Vitamin D3 daily, somewhere between 1000-4000 IU, you can technically take too much, but the risk is generally low.</p>
<p>I just hope when the one study from the UK comes out, many people on both sides will be ready to change what they believe if the results contradict their narrative.</p>

        <p>Ok my friend, I think we've reached the conclusion of this discussion. We're mostly arguing opinions and semantics at this point, and I sincerely doubt that either of us is really going to change our mind. Plus it's getting really late where I am, and I'm not really interested in continuing into another day.</p>
<p>I'll concede a few points: I find the vaccine manufacturer settlement cases very concerning, and I share your distrust of immoral corporations, it's just a cost/risk assessment that tips in a different direction for me. The vitamin D research does look promising, although I don't have quite as much faith in it as you do. This UK challenge trial does look to be a valuable source of information, although I find the ethics very questionable. </p>
<p>You've exposed me to some valuable info and tested my opinions more than most. I want to thank you for that, and I wish you the best of luck.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, have a good night. Obviously in China it’s midday so not at all late here ;)</p>
<p>Since you just brought up cost/risk assessment, I’ll leave you with one last link, but do yourself a favor and do not read this until after you sleep, I will not respond for at least 8 hours on principle even if you do ask me about it.</p>
<p>https://fee.org/articles/costs-of-covid-mitigation-efforts-vastly-outweigh-benefits-for-89-of-population-health-researchers-conclude/</p>
<p>I promise if those studies with exposure testing vaccines, and hope in the future masks, I will at least change my opinion accordingly.</p>
<p>Also, it’s not that I actually trust vitamin D, it’s that there is solid evidence and the cost of taking it is just so low that I feel it’s easily worth it. </p>
<p>Interesting that you find that UK study unethical, whereas I think it’s great, yet I think requiring masks on planes are unethical and you think they’re great. I’m sure there is something to be learned from this gap, but let’s leave it at that for now. It has at least been much more enjoyable to discuss this with you than just about anyone else on here.</p>

        <p>Based on my interactions with people in public, it is physically impossible for a masked individual to not comment when they see someone without one regardless if they are outside. It’s like vegans. They can’t not tell you. </p>
<p>I was helping a friend change his headlights at an apartment complex in downtown Minneapolis. It was outside about 75 feet from the entrance to the building. Some guy told me to wear a mask while I was doing this while outside. After he commented (while wearing his mask) I simply responded “no thanks” and he proceeded to storm off inside like I offended him. The guy only stepped outside to tell me that. </p>
<p>That folks is what we are dealing with. People who are on such a high horse for no reason, they need to interject into all of our lives.... like vegans at a restaurant or grocery store. *i mean no offense to vegans if you choose to eliminate meat from your diet due to health reasons.</p>
