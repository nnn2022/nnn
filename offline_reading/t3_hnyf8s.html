    <strong>New Normal at the gym... wtf did I just read? How is this sustainable?</strong>
    <p><p>We’ll be cleaning throughout the day, and deep cleaning each night. We’ll have temperature scans, a requirement for face coverings and alcohol based liquid chalk, sanitizer stations throughout the gym, and a reservation based occupancy limit below legal guidelines, to name just a few. </p>
<p>In order to allow for additional cleaning, we are limiting gym hours from 7am – 10pm.</p>
<p>Please see these new policies:</p>
<p>• To ensure safe distancing, we are not able to offer the sale of daypasses, the use of punchcards, or member guest passes. Hopefully we’ll be able to do this soon.</p>
<p>• Please maintain 6+ feet of space from others at all times</p>
<p>• Be mindful of posted capacities for individual spaces within the gym</p>
<p>• Guests must wear masks at all times</p>
<p>• We are not offering rental shoes or providing loaner chalk bags at this time</p>
<p>• We will only be allowing liquid chalk, and selling it without a markup at the front desk</p>
<p>• Wipe down fitness equipment and other shared surfaces before and after use</p>
<p>• Wash your hands thoroughly upon entering the gym, during your visit, and upon leaving</p>
<p>• Avoid walking barefoot around the gym as much as possible</p>
<p>• Showers and saunas are closed</p>
<p>• Lockers are also closed, and locker rooms should be used primarily for hand washing and bathrooms</p>
<p>• We will not be offering towels at this time — bring your own if you like to have one when you work out</p>
<p>• Our water fountains will only be available for personal bottle refill</p>
<p>• We’re asking members to check in and check out at their respective entrances so we can have a clear facility headcount at all times and be able to more accurately fulfill contact tracing requirements.</p>
<p>We have a thermal scanner at the front door to read the body temperature of every guest. If a temperature of 100º F or higher is read by the thermometer, it will alert front desk staff, who will inform the guest, and ask that they not continue into the gym. We also require guests to refrain from making another reservation until at least three days after their temperature subsides.</p>
<p>We will not allow members to use the gym if they answer yes to any of the following:</p>
<p>• Symptoms: have you had any known symptoms of COVID-19 in the last two weeks? Primary symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, repeated shaking with chills, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and/or new loss of taste or smell. </p>
<p>• Contact: have you come into contact with anyone in the last two weeks known to be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19?</p>
<p>We will ask guests to sign a health declaration on each visit to the gym.</p>
<p>Our staff will be implementing frequent cleaning &amp; sanitation routines throughout the day. We will be deep cleaning the entire gym each night.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p>• We will have a hand washing station set up at the main entrance to the gym — please use it before entering the gym and upon leaving</p>
<p>• We will provide lots (and lots) of hand sanitizer stations throughout the facility. It’s there for you to use — please do so frequently and especially before and after touching shared equipment or climbing holds</p>
<p>• We ask that guests wipe down all fitness equipment before and after using it</p>
<p>• We’ve installed glass barriers at our desks to protect staff and visitors during check in</p>
<p>Reservations can be made up to 2 weeks in advance, and members must have an advance reservation before visiting the gym.  </p>
<p>Initially, we are asking members to limit their advance reservations to 2 per week in order to ensure availability for everyone. We'll lift this as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Further, after your first reserved visit — where we will confirm that you have an updated waiver on file — future day-of reservations will not be limited. So after your first visit, you can always reserve day-of, and come to the gym if there are day-of reservations available. </p>
<p>No cancellation or no-show fee, but please only make reservations you're sure you will attend, and be sure to cancel reservations here if your plans change.</p>
<p>We’re going to err on the side of low occupancy, cause it prioritizes safety. And think about how awesome it will be to go berserk with so many boulders and so much space. Safety and experience are paramount.</p>
<p>Also to ensure safe distancing, we are not able to offer the sale of daypasses, the use of punchcards, or member guest passes. Hopefully we’ll be able to do this soon. </p>
<p>Reservations are for one hour and forty five minutes, and can be made up to two weeks in advance. We are requiring separate reservations for fitness and climbing:</p>
<p>• Climbing reservations allow members to utilize the reserved climbing section, but do not include access to the dojo or fitness areas</p>
<p>• Fitness reservations allow members to use the reserved fitness section, but do not include access to the dojo or main climbing areas</p>
<p>• Dojo reservations allow members to use only the climbing training area — spraywall, treadwall, moonboard, etc.</p>
<p>We’ll have two separate entrances to reduce traffic in the lobby. Depending on which section you’ve reserved time in, you’ll be asked to enter and leave through a specific door.</p></p>

        <p>I made a post a few days ago, but I cancelled my gym membership this week.</p>
<p>I love the gym. I’ve been a faithful gym rat for half my life. When they opened back up with increased cleaning and half the machines closed to support social distancing, I happily went back to support them. I figured they were doing their best to comply with all the bullshit. Yes, there were less machines and no classes, but I was okay with it.</p>
<p>Then this week they doubled down on masks, requiring them for all indoor activities except swimming. Of course you still have to wear your mask entering the pool room and leaving.</p>
<p>That was the final straw for me. I’m forced to wear a mask at work. I’m forced to wear a mask if I want to go shopping. But as much as I have a choice, I will not pay for the privilege of having less equipment available while also being forced to wear a mask while running and lifting. I go to the gym to challenge myself physically, and I refuse to be any more uncomfortable by adding a mask to it.</p>
<p>There is supposedly a waiver you can sign for medical purposes that will exempt you from having to wear the mask, but you know what, I’m done playing this game. I’m not going through the hassle of filling out paperwork, being questioned, having people give me dirty looks or make snide comments, all for a place where I’m PAYING to be. If they go out of business, oh well. That’s on them. </p>
<p>I really hate working out at home. I’ve always seen the gym as a place to regroup. I love pushing myself and being around others and having access to lots of different machines and equipment. But I just can’t get on board with this. I will not be treated like some criminal disease vector while paying for the privilege to do so.</p>

        <p>&rt;There is supposedly a waiver you can sign for medical purposes that will exempt you from having to wear the mask,</p>
<p>So much bullshit.  </p>
<p>A place that isn't run by trained professionals to keep your personal information safe <em>should not</em> <strong><em>ever</em></strong> be trusted with information that is otherwise protected under the law for safe keeping.  </p>
<p>The link in the "safe keeping" chain is the weakest member in it.  And sometimes, the weakest member is a petty asshole that might leak whatever medical information you've submitted to someone important because they claim they overheard you saying you support Trump or something.</p>
<p>A medical office leaks your personal info?  You better believe there will be lawsuits for years.  </p>
<p>A gym does this?  Genie's out of the bottle and some low-wage nobody gets fired but otherwise the gym suffers no real consequences.  </p>
<p>And THAT is why we have HIPAA, folks.  </p>
<p>Because your personal info is absolutely, <em>positively, under every conceivable circumstance</em> <strong><em>NOBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS.</em></strong></p>

        <p>That’s another great point. It’s really none of the gyms business what medical conditions I may or may not have beyond something very evident that would greatly impede my use of the gym. I’m wondering if the mask ordinances will somehow come under fire through an ADA lawsuit. Would be a good way to get around it.</p>
<p>I should not have to justify myself to gym staff and gym patrons or anyone else. I should be able to walk in, swipe my membership card, and use the equipment freely as I have done for years. The fact that there’s even a waiver indicates it’s more for show than anything else.</p>

        <p>The amount of breath you need when you are doing fitness is far greater than just simply walking. Oxygenating muscles are very important during working out. Masks definitely don’t allow for the type of airflow you need to run, lift, and cycle.</p>

        <p>The amount you breath literally has nothing to do with it.  Nurses, doctors, and plenty of different jobs wear masks all day long without oxygen issues and they aren't sitting on their ass all day either.  Stop being retarded.</p>

        <p>Being busy on your feet all day, while it is not sitting on your ass (your words, not mine) is NOT the same oxygen demand as running or cycling.</p>
<p>But if you don't workout and don't understand that, maybe it is just something you should research, perhaps in substitution of behaving so unkindly.</p>

        <p>I workout twice a day, for 45 minutes, literally everyday.  Oxygen is so fucking small that there is 0 chance it gets limited going through a mask.  Oxygen is .34 nanometers in size where virus particles are up to 100.  That is almost 300x bigger.</p>
<p>You are actually mentally retarded if you think a mask will stop oxygen from getting to your lungs.</p>

        <p>This is like all the emails I get from places near me declaring they are open.  But then what follows is a 4-page legal document with all the rules and regulations about how to properly have fun.  WTF?  No thanks.  This is why I'm just staying home.  Even though places claim to be open they are so full of onerous regulations that I can't see how anyone would enjoy their time there.</p>
<p>Latest was a local winery.  They start by saying the usual "we're open for you to enjoy your time!" so happy, right?  Then so many rules about not standing here, walking this way, using the bathroom this way, buying water that way, only sitting here to drink a glass of wine, then you have to leave.  It's mind-boggling.</p>

        <p>Thermal scanners read core body temp so ice on the forehead won’t work, but 800mg of ibuprofen about an hour before should leave you with a normal body temp. Although,I’m not really sure who feels good enough when they have an actual fever that they’d go workout anyway.</p>

<p>From an article published in 2014: The thermometer tells how hot a person is by measuring the infrared energy coming off the body. "Human skin is a very good — or very efficient — emitter of infrared energy," says Gary O'Hara, chief technology officer for Sanomedics, which manufactures CareGiver, the brand of thermometer now being used in some airports.</p>

        <p>Interesting. It certainly seems like the touch-less infrared ones are just measuring emitted IR blackbody radiation. In which case, still seems like they'd be very easy to game.</p>

        <p>It's not sustainable.   Eventually the gyms will go out of business because nobody will want to go to them and they cannot operate at a profitable capacity.</p>

        <p>No way any of this crap is sustainable. I regrettably canceled my membership last week. I feel bad cause I know a lot of gym members were forced into making these ridiculous rules. By Boomers and other old people who don’t even use the gym. Fuck these people telling us how to live our lives!</p>
