    <strong>Anyone who says “This could have been over if everyone just cooperated” is gaslighting you.</strong>
    <p><p>We’ve all heard it. A lockdown fanatic rationalizes the never-ending lockdowns and the shifting goalposts by blaming people who supposedly have not been complying. “This would have been over months ago if everyone just did what they were supposed to. Whether intentional or not, this is gaslighting.</p>
<p>Not only is this not true, but the exact OPPOSITE is true. Do these people not understand that “flatten the curve”, “slow the spread”, and “wait until a vaccine” all by definition mean stretching this out? Lockdowns do not eradicate viruses, they only delay the inevitable. As soon as the lockdown ends the virus spreads.</p>
<p>If our goal was speed, then this whole pandemic could have been over in a few weeks if we just let it spread through the population, while shielding the elderly and vulnerable of course. The entire point of “flattening the curve” was to drag this out. Slowing the spread and waiting for a vaccine all prolong and delay.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks lockdowns could have eradicated the virus from every corner of the planet is either lying, ignorant, or insane. Even countries that were praised for keeping out the virus are now suffering new outbreaks.</p>
<p>Never let lockdown enthusiasts gaslight you like this. They’re the ones who locked us inside and destroyed the global economy. These charlatans have caused unprecedented damage to our society, but they would rather blame you than own up to their mistakes.</p></p>
