        <p>California should be a good example of how extended lock downs and restrictions just don't work. CA residents fully complied back in March and L.A. County/San Francisco had huge mask compliance. You can only lock down a population for so long before they break. And CA residents seem to have had enough. Plus all the mixed message CA residents received didn't help. Why is everything closed EXCEPT for mall and retail stores is what many are thinking.</p>

        <p>The moment of truth for a lot of people here is when they learned that this won’t end with a vaccine, and we’ll keep having to mask/social distance for months after.</p>
<p>Multiple of my friends who were leaning pro-lockdown switched immediately after hearing that... it’s like a lightbulb went off in their head. A few literally didn’t believe me until I quoted Fauci saying mask mandates will continue for most of 2021.</p>
<p>Of course plenty of people are a lost cause, but for those people who don’t watch much news and kinda go with the flow while doing their own thing, it’s worth a shot.</p>

        <p>I live in Illinois and I feel like we've been "flying under the radar". We have had some pretty strict lock downs. Right now the only thing open is retail, open restaurants and some gyms. The thing is, outside of Chicago, people are openly defying Gov. Pritzker's Covid rules. Large suburbs are completely open and business as usual. IMO, the bars/restaurants here did it right. The banded together, filed law suits and quietly remained open. They didn't go on Tucker Carlson and antagonize the Governor. There is hope that this shit will end quick once the vaccines get rolling out.</p>

        <p>They had the entire doomer wishlist and then some, and their reward was...another massive spike in cases and deaths. Supposedly, anyway. </p>
<p>It's just mind blowing that this crap isn't completely discredited based on what's right in front of people's eyes.</p>
