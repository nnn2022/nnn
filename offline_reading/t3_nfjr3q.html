    <strong>Where is the clown world coming from?</strong>
    <p><p>Woke up one day in 2015 and it was a clown world. 2016-2017 it started getting worse but now its a full on clown world. It seems like just about everything has been inverted including morals. Honesty and hard work no longer gets you anywhere. People don't want to do the right thing anymore. Any right wing opinion gets censored. Tons of people are coloring their hair bright colors. Obesity rates are sky high. Gender roles are reversed and men act like women and women act masculine. Femnazis everywhere. There seems to be little or no critical thinking. It's just turned into dystopian clown world</p></p>

        <p>Religion was demonized and removed from society without replacing it with a solid education in morality, ethics and philosophy. </p>
<p>We replaced it with a bastardized version of science instead. </p>
<p>Now we are in <em>"the ends justify the means</em>" territory. </p>
<p>This has been applied to everything including inequality.</p>

        <p>Tumblr and Social Media really picked up steam in 2014-2015 and allowed mentally ill freaks to congregate in ways they hadn't been able to previously.</p>
<p>Before, if you wanted to cut your dick off or have people refer to you as "deerkin", or got upset about the name of a sports team, 99% of the population aggressively told you to cut that shit out and would ostracize you until you got the message that you were being weird, schizo, and creepy. If you never stopped, congrats, you now have no friends. You played yourself.</p>
<p>From 2015 onward, kids simply went online and found 10,000 other mentally ill people on Tumblr to enable them. These people then started working as a team to enforce public entities and corporations to bow to their demands using very modern means, like social media smear campaigns - the likes of which companies previously hadn't faced and were ill-equipped to deal with.</p>
<p>Companies had no plans for damage control or steps to fight back against deranged children on social media - <em>nobody imagined lunatics on Twitter would beg cookie companies to take a stance on cutting your penis off or else face a smear campaign</em> - so the only option they've enacted is to simply roll over and appeal to the mob.</p>

        <p>Oh believe me I'd love to go back to the 20th century, when the genders generally looked different and people were far healthier  - both mentally and physically, than they are today. I thought it was just me noticing a few years ago how a significant number kids and young adults seem to have some mental illness/disorder that they can't function normally. and carry on a regular conversation. Maybe it's the fluoride, the crap food with all it's dyes and preservatives, social media and lack of social interaction or being told how "special" and "unique" they are and overparented. Probably a combo.</p>

        <p>same, just a bit older than you. I feel like every generation grows weaker and weaker. Young men definitely seem more effeminate and I know there are must be some intelligent and mature teens out there but I find it difficult to find any common ground with the majority of today's batch. At least as a teen I had a semblance of  self awareness and personal responsibility I feel like this is something lacking with the majority of kids today, with the risk of sounding old and cantankerous. lol</p>

        <p>I got my first job when I was 15 and moved out at 17. It definitely seems like most teens have no motivation now and just want to hide under the covers surrounded by electronics and stuffed animals and post about their anxiety disorder on Twitter or whatever.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s across the board because I still see teens out skateboarding and playing basketball and stuff in my neighborhood but it seems like a lot less than say, 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Edit: if I sound crotchety, I don’t mean to, I grew up on video games and still love them. All my friends played them too. But we also played outside</p>

        <p>I think it's the smartphones, because they're literally available at your fingertips and you can be online 24/7. Before university, I had to share a computer with my sister and we had dial-up internet, so there wasn't that constant connection and we found other things to do (like go outside). I'm 34, btw.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm noticing a lot more people seem to have some kind of mood disorder, add or ocd. A lot of narcissism too. I've also noticed more and more people seem to have autism. It was extremely rare to see any of this 10 years ago. A lot of people just seem dead inside too. I'm starting to feel like that myself.</p>

        <p>There is a theory that nut allergies are way up because so many parents now don"t let their kids try nuts at young ages. On NPR years ago they talked about an African tribe where the mothers would chew food then give it to the babies (like birds) and apparently nut allergies are almost unheard of among that tribe.</p>

        <p>I've heard it has to do with the rise of junk food and processed food. Everyone's eating nothing but crap from the moment we're born, is it any wonder we're sick?</p>
<p>Although when it comes to mental disorders, I personally think a lot of it is just medicalization of perfectly normal people. Like, I don't even think people are mis-diagnosing themselves or applying things too broadly- if you go to the DSM and read it, it will probably accurately describe you for at least something. I can't really blame people for believing that, since you would think it's authoritative... And buying expensive pharmaceuticals to treat themselves, of course...</p>

<p>That's why I'd be scared to be one of the fringes when the inevitable backlash occurs. Its going to be hard, its going to be sharp, and people who thought that they were safe being deviants in a tolerant world are going to find out real quick just how precarious their status was and how much it relied on good will of people who just aren't going to to put up with it anymore.</p>

I think it’s a crisis that’s been brewing for a long time, since the end of the new deal era. Financial inequality and an increasingly complex society leading to social decay. People are drugged up, in debt, isolated, tired, scared about the changing world and uncertain of their place in it.</p>

        <p>We are in the last days, as described in the Bible, aka end times, the Days of Noah all over again, as predicted. Mankind is lost, without moral compass and anchor of truth. That's because they lost touch with the Father, after centuries of brainwash and delusion through the false enlightnment through scientism, and especially the 20th century did us in.

        <p>Social media fake outrage over everything with clicks becoming the new advertising stream for journalism. The machine picked up steam right around 2012 (remember Occupy Wallstreet?), as most of the West was on high speed internet with smart phone access. Facebook crossed MySpace in web traffic in 2009.

        <p>I think it's the internet... I try to use it minimally, or only when I have a specific purpose in mind. Otherwise people begin spending their entire lives online, get disconnected from their own bodies, and think that the internet is the real world. Spending so much time plugged in makes people totally disconnected from reality. </p>
<p>Fat and sick? Doesn't matter, you'll hardly notice while you're sitting motionless in a gamer chair surfing youtube. </p>
<p>Wages haven't risen in decades (unless you're a ceo) but cost of living has? Post about it on instagram, that's what 'activism' is. </p>
