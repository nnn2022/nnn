        <p>hasn't there been a "conspiracy" floating around about hiv and covid for a while now? </p>
<p>there was that Indian study that allegedly found hiv similarities in covid 19. </p>
<p>and weren't there conspiracy theories around covid vaccine using hiv markers to deliver. I can't remember the details it was something like they were using hiv to break into the rna. something very sketchy</p>

        <p>Yes, I have spent a LOT of time looking into this. It's not for certain of course, but it is (in my view) way more likely than not that this was the cause. They did not use the appropriate monkey kidneys. The simian population they actually used was filled with SIV (the monkey version of HIV), and they used those ground up kidneys to make the vaccines. Years later, HIV begins in the exact areas where the oral vaccine was used.</p>
