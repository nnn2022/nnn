    <strong>Infectiousness and lethality of new mutations, in particular UK and South Africa strains - are there new studies and/or ways to tell which direction they are taking?</strong>
    <p><p>I've discussed before about mutations and this time I figured I would inquire as to has actually been found about these mutations and how quickly they spread and if they are more or less lethal than the original variant.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It has substantial relevancy to lockdown discussion because the claim that the new mutations are more infectious is a leading argument now used for why lockdowns and restrictions need to be less forgiving and more people need to be coerced to stay at home.  Ferguson, the original COrona modeler, a few months ago predicted it would be 70 % more infectious.  In several countries it's being blamed for infection rates happening in spite of vaccination campaigns.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In theory, has has been well established by now, evolution favors viruses that spread as effectively as possible while being as nonlethal as possible.  Hence why the common cold remains among the most succesful of viruses.  So I was wondering if there's been reliable evidence one way or the other about whether or not the UK, South Africa and other mutations have been more infectious?  And if so if they've been more or less dangerous?  If they've been proven to be more infectious and also less lethal, that would be proof that the skeptic's arguments have been right.  If they've been more infectious and retainerd all their lethality, that could be very bad; it couild be used to make a case that our lives haven't been upended and we need to embrace more totalitarianism, unless the vaccines end up doing their job and ensuring our immune responses can handle all mutations.</p></p>
