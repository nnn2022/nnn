    <strong>If the elites really wanted to do something here in the US, they kind of failed.</strong>
    <p><p>More and more places are going back to normal, dropping distancing mandates and mask requirements.</p>
<p>I thought the globalists were going to keep the people locked in and muzzled until 2030 when the agenda was supposed to start ðŸ¤”</p>
<p>Not much really happened, people were still getting some sort of money, and were able to get food/supplies/medical care, they were able to keep in touch by phone and online.</p>
<p>So what was the plan?</p>
<p>If they really wanted to do something they would have 1.) Rendered money useless 2.) Stop people from doing basic things: food, water, shelter, medical care. 3.) Actually implemented plans to restrict travel and keep everyone remanded at home with enforcement. 4.) Provide "care packages" on a monthly basis that gave people what they needed, keeping them latched on to the governmental teat. </p>
<p>Yet all last year I was able to go anywhere and do almost anything, except for movies, arcades, bars, but nothing that I'd say was absolutely necessary for survival.</p>
<p>Curfews weren't enforced, neither was distancing, grocery stores were still packed. The only thing enforced were the muzzles, but if you didn't want to do that there were alternatives.</p>
<p>And now things are slowly going back to the way they were.</p>
<p>I guess we'll be seeing a new season of American Idol while they cook up the next thing.</p></p>

        <p>The plan? I don't think they expected so much vaccine "hesitancy". I also don't think they planned on 2 states ignoring the narrative and opening back up completely.</p>
<p>However, I think the plan to crash the world economy is still in motion and can't be stopped.</p>
<p>Canada seems like it's still on track because they haven't been giving any resistance to the Great Reset.</p>

        <p>Ok, many places are going back to normal. How many of those places went back to normal because people stood up for their freedoms and fought for it? Done counting? Ok write that number down. Now, how many places went back to normal because the politicians who run that state ALLOWED it to happen? Which number is higher? Now here's the 6 million dollar question...what exactly is preventing those politicians who opened their states back up from flipping that switch and putting everyone in lockdowns, close businesses, mask mandates and all that shit again?</p>

        <p>In the background, the Fed bought every central bank in the "free world", literally. People always say, Well, if Covid is a hoax, then how come the whole world shutdown?". The answer is the same as it ever was, money.</p>
<p>People don't understand that only a handful of entities are allowed to "make printer go bbbrrrrrrrr". Most countries are at our mercy because they must convert their dollars into American dollars to transact for oil. Control is one reason for this and the other is to export our inflation by always having an increasing demand for more dollars because every nation always need more oil. Throw in some price manipulation of oil and you've got yourself an inflation exporting machine with a control valve.</p>
<p>But, the game was up by late 2019 and the Fed knew it. They needed a cover story fast because the Fed does NOT want to take any blame for a global economic disaster. If that happens while the Fed is in charge, they will lose all their power and control of every market because the people will rightly and finally point out the source of all evil since 1913.</p>
<p>They needed a BIG cover story. And I mean BIG! That's what Covid started out as. I think the elites decided that now was as good as time as any to make a run at total domination. I do believe their plans were expedited from their original intentions. One, because Trump riled up the patriotic base WAAAAYYYY too much for their liking and two, because of impending collapse of the entire financial system.</p>
<p>Grift, corruption and greed have ridden the back of this thing like a circus monkey, while most of us were just trying to figure out if we had entered a portal into clown world. At least none can complain that life isn't interesting any more.</p>

        <p>Hmm this could be just the thing I need for my story. I had an idea like this of a total global economic collapse, except the rich felt little if nothing. Leaving the people to fend for themselves.</p>

        <p>Right... Well, good for you, I guess. But here in reality, they've destroyed the working economy to transfer more wealth to the billionaires &amp; mega-corporations. Glad you don't care &amp; don't miss all the things that normal people enjoyed in life.</p>
