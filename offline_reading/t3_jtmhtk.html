<h1>Joe Biden's COVID-19 board co-chair says US lockdown unlikely under new administration</h1>
<p>Vivek Murthy said he'd instead like to focus on targeted interventions to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who is a co-chair of President-elect Joe Biden's coronavirus task force, spoke to "Good Morning America" exclusively on Friday, Nov. 13.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who is a co-chair of Joe Biden's coronavirus task force, assured that "locking down" the U.S. is unlikely under the president-elect's administration.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to "Good Morning America" Friday, Murthy said compared to spring 2020, American researchers have a much deeper understanding of how the coronavirus spreads and ways to prevent risks."I don't think that this is [about] a lockdown or not locking down ... The way we should be thinking about this is more like a series of restrictions that we dial up or down depending on how bad the spread is taking place in a specific region," he said.</p>
<p>Murthy's comments come <a href="https://abc7.com/michael-osterholm-us-lockdown-nationwide-is-under/7896126/">after news reports of Dr. Michael Osterholm</a>, another member of Biden's COVID-19 advisory team, floating the idea of a four-to-six week lockdown during an on-camera interview with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>[This last part is hilarious - apparently someone shot his mouth off and got called on the carpet.]</p>
<p>Osterholm has since told ABC News that he has not discussed this proposal with the incoming administration and doesn't think there's a national consensus for it anyway.</p>
<p>"I've never discussed any of this with them ... Nobody's going to support it. It's not going to be supported out of the administration. It's not going to be supported in Congress,"  Osterholm told ABC News.</p></p>
