<p>I'm not sure why anyone would describe "following medical advice" this way but following medical advice is actually a healthy thing. That's the whole idea behind medical advice, is that it is healthy.</p>
<p>If there's some reason this medical advice would be unhealthy - the advice itself, not the ramifications of it - I'd like to hear about it... hopefully this isn't blind allegiance to internet shitposters! that would be embarrassing.</p>

        <p>Following medical advice is good. Following advice with no actual backing that changes depending on the elites agenda of the day I would not say is too good. Ironically it's a lot of the folks that claim to be fighting for "equality" and power to the people and all that good stuff seem to love taking blind orders from the most powerful people in the world.</p>

<p>the burden of proof lies on the person making the claim; if you presented a claim without evidence it should be dismissed without evidence.</p>
<p>&rt;Dr Battacharya</p>
<p>no results came up for this name, it suggested corrections</p>
<p>&rt;Dr Andrew Kauffman</p>
<p>has denied the existence of the common cold, polio, HIV-AIDS, viral hepatitis, chickenpox, COVID-19, and measles. One of his favourite examples for why his war against germ theory is justified is the case of Stefan Lanka, which he sells to his audience as “the Supreme Court of Germany actually ruled that there is no measles virus that’s been proved to exist” (he asked for 1 single scientific paper proving that measles exists and someone provided 6). technically speaking, that is a doctor that disagrees with lockdowns i guess, if that's who you're hitching your wagon to.</p>
<p>did you have any other examples?</p>

        <p>And would you call healthy advice being told to stay inside for months without much needed social interaction (and on a limited scale with restrictions, if any), thus weakening your immune system through lack of exposure to germs, limited vitamins and less exercise. Sure, maybe from a limited perspective based only on viruses this might seem like good health advice but on the wider scale it is anything but.</p>

<p>definitely not. i would call healthy advice "standing a few feet away and wearing a mask" just like i would call healthy advice "driving sober and wearing a seatbelt." why would you not be taking your vitamins just because you stand 6ft away from another guy? LMAO</p>

        <p>Unfortunately though, that's what we've been made to do. By vitamins I mean the ones you get from going outside, especially from the sun. I don't mind staying away from strangers but is putting a piece of cloth covered in germs from who knows where on your face really doing anyone any good? Masks are constantly in and out of pockets, touched and adjusted - they just collect germs like a dish.</p>

        <p>Okay, the vitamin bit wasn't really the point but in general people have been outside far less over the course of this year.</p>
<p>As for the masks, it's a tricky thing. You're not supposed to reuse them so many people use cloth, but because many are also chucking them after one use it's worsening our waste and ocean problem. Regardless of what you're supposed to do, people do reuse them and they go in and out of pockets and are rarely washed all the time - I'm just talking from what I've seen in general. The thing is maybe in theory the masks are good but when they're actually used in real life people don't use them perfectly and it may counter any positive effects they have.</p>

<p>you're not supposed to do that either. the whole point is that people are failing to follow simple medical advice (wear a mask properly) and then wondering why shit isn't working after 60 weeks of failing to do the bare minimum.</p>

        <p>What I'm saying is that on the one hand, you're supposed to have an abundance of professional masks that you frequently change and dispose of after one use. But that is <em>a lot</em> of masks and a lot of pollution and a whole lot of other problems. So it's cheaper and more sustainable to use cloth masks, however they are far less effective so you're met with a dilemma. On paper as an idea, this mask mandate might be effective but when you factor in human behaviour and other related issues and problems the strategy could cause or add to (such as excessive waste), things aren't perfect and they don't turn out the way we expected.</p>

        <p>‘the advice itself, not the ramifications of it’ - the ramifications are part of the package.  They’re always part of the package.  This is how humans make rational decisions, by weighing up the positive outcomes vs the negative outcomes.  Or at least it was, until 2020.</p>

        <p>No one follows any simple directions 'cause they are not simple directions. Here, despite what you've made to believe, there was zero mask on sight outside during summer, open tourist season. We had however explosion of cases around November-December &amp; I've known personally dozens of corona cases since then... During all those times we didn't lockdown, we still traveled on national level, visited our families and saw our friends, hospitals were open for regular patients... We didn't follow anything, we just decided shit is not worth stop living for.</p>

        <p>This isn’t just about intelligence, it’s about morality, it’s about what you can cope with.  Sure, the directions are easy enough to UNDERSTAND (though perhaps not even that when they keep chopping and changing, the UK went through a period of big changes each week), but easy to follow?  No.  Not at all.</p>

        <p>Before I went there I didn't actually realize what a big Italian connection there is.  It really is like a more chilled out version of Italy.  When I was there they also weren't on the euro so everything was waaaay cheaper.  Not sure if that's still the case or not</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I will not be responsible for you or any other rando who cannot deal with going outside  your prison cell.  I am also OK with being infected if living a normal life results in this I would never be so demanding, arrogant and self important to force others to accommodate paranoia. Life is a risk and you were perfectly fine with it and never even thought of risk until a year ago. It's been an entire year. No one gives a shit about you except for your loved ones if you're lucky enough to have them. If you are actually expecting complete strangers to live their lives around protecting you you are going to have a rude awakening. If you dont see what's really going on at this point.... Best of luck with your expectations.</p>

        <p>You must be a child. You have a huge reality check coming. Unless you are a parent and caring for children people always put themselves first and denying that makes you completely lacking in any self awareness or a liar. Strangers do not care about you that is reality which you would see if you aren't living in an idealistic bubble.</p>

        <p>Why is it that everyone on here tries to invalidate an argument by accusing them of being a child or a bot lol it's very telling, thank you</p>
<p>ok I understand that you're trying to justify you being selfish, but let's not. It reads the same way regardless. Being like "I don't care about you! You're a stranger!" Doesn't change that you're also saying "I'm willing to infect and potentially kill you because masks are itchy :/" I don't expect anyone to care about me, but I expect them to avoid <em>intentionally</em> harming me and vice versa because that's the bare minimum for human decency, and that's where we differ. Maybe I was hugged enough as a child, who knows</p>
<p>Most strangers you see don't go out of their way to hurt you, right? They don't care about you but they also don't disrespect you so much to the point where they want to infect you, so you guys are a totally different breed</p>
<p>And how is doing the bare minimum and avoiding spreading your germs in a pandemic considered standards for an idealistic bubble? lol all you have to do is not cough or breathe on people through the use of a mask and you guys are like "omg you're asking for too much. This is the real world, we spit in each other's mouths"</p>

        <p>Good to know! I'm in MN, and no offense, but ND was not a top vacation destination for me...until now. I only want to go places I can drive (I will not fly until the mask rules are gone) and that people aren't expected to wear masks/social distance/have curfews. Is Fargo and/or Grand Forks cool in regards to not having restrictions/mask mandates?</p>

        <p>Lol, none taken. Actually, ND was a top destination for people from Manitoba who wanted to come shop at Scheels. </p>
<p>Both Fargo and Grand Forks are going to let the mask mandates expire. Even now though, you won't get talked to if you walk into a business without a mask on. The one exception to this is businesses in downtown Fargo, but they think George Floyd is the second coming so whaddya expect.</p>
<p>Go outside either of the big cities and you'll be the odd one out if you DO have a mask on.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's nice. The one thing to note is that masks are technically required out of your seat, and they do enforce it when scanning tickets. After that, though, nobody cares.</p>

        <p>I’m from Croatia and I can tell you We stopped giving s#it about Covid after I would say 1 month. At this point most public places are open like schools, stores, malls, cinemas etc... and in my school a lot of students say it is stupid to have mask mandades because we hang out after school and we can easily catch Covid. Plus, I can assure you that at the mall people are being like 2 cm apart one from another. You basically just need a mask to enter public places after that you continue not giving a f#ck about it.</p>

        <p>It’s sad to me that just people living their lives normally is so unusual that this looks like a paradise.  The new normal will be decided by how much fear we let into ourselves.  Fear is the root of insanity.  And societies outward projections come from our inner states.  It’s time for inner peace and release.</p>

        <p>5600 is a lot considering it’s a country of 4 million people. By the way, Sweden has had over 13,000 deaths so make sure your numbers are correct when in these discussions. You have a population of 10 million so yes, 13,000+ deaths is a lot. Sweden is nearing 1 million total cases. That’s 10% of your population . We have over 500,000 total deaths in the US, but our population is about 328 million total. That’s an insane amount of deaths.</p>

        <p>Yeah sorry. It was 9000 deaths in 2020. If we'd still count deaths yearly. Like with influenza. But Covid still keeps on rolling. Slowly but steadily. Flu season after flu season. So 9000 deaths is huge to you. Why was Swedish total deaths per year like fifth highest in 10 year timespan? Do you understand? Why was there 8 influenza deaths whole year, when year before there was nearly 4000?</p>

        <p>Governments are not sovereign as you seem to believe. Money talks. Richest people rule everything. Why do you suppose leaders of nations gather together with bankers and richest people in the world in Bilderberg meetings? Enjoy sauna and talk sports? Covid is just a great tool to crash world economy and introduce a new system. World Economic Forum openly admits it wants a Great Reset so world can transfer to an economic system where "you will own nothing and be happy". That was direct quote from Claus Schwab, chairman (I guess) of WEF. Do your own research, don't trust me. I'm just some random Finnish dude.</p>

        <p>They have more deaths per capita than France. Or Brazil. Or even Sweden.</p>
<p>Their graphs look identical to every other country's graphs. November rise, mid-December peak and fast plummet. It's a bit on the rise again because of the re-opening, but the population will likely disregard it.</p>

        <p>Croat here. No, but I would guess it’s better than in your country. Masks mandatory in public transport and practically every closed space, no fans on stadiums, no clubs, and bars and restaurants only outside and until 10 PM but I would say they are pretty flexible since in many cases that “outside” is actually a closed space but on the street and they sometimes let you stay longer (I was with friends watching a game that started i 9 PM in a bar and the owner didn’t close until the game was over). But people really stopped caring and there are massive parties on a square in city center every weekend in the capital Zagreb and police just strolls around and only intervene when there is a fight</p>

        <p>I would say it’s accurate representation of common people since massive spontaneous gatherings happen every weekend across cities and almost nobody born after WW2 gives a shit about this cold anymore but our government which is incredibly deep into Merkel’s asshole still talks about how virus is dangerous all the time, propaganda for vaccination is everywhere and “covid staff” (main “experts” in the country for virus, some of which are ministers from government) still comes to live tv couple of times a week and answers the same questions media asks them every time. Also members of covid staff are easily the most despised people in the country and people openly insult them on every social platform and news website</p>

<p>And yes but to be fair, shops/transport are one of the only things still open to full capacity, and everything else without a mask still requires social distancing, food orders on a to-go basis, and a curfew</p>

        <p>All borders to neighboring countries are still closed, summer festivals still haven't been given green light, we're one of the worst in EU in vaccinations (you can be against vaccines all you want but you ain't doing nothing without a covid passport), classes are still online (with exception for few grades in highschool)</p>

        <p>Taxes same as many other countries, from 15% to 45% depending on your income, freedom is not restricted as far as I know, I think army is obligatory but probably not for non-citizens. Internet is ok, not the greatest, I think it's one of the slowest in Europe, but the beaches are spectacular. I don't live in Croatiaб ( I have some friends there) so maybe someone else knows more.</p>

        <p>They were lockdowned from march to may and then for months they were open with mandatory masks in shops and restaurants. Then in November they closed until february because EU gave them money to pay people not to work (otherwise they couldn't afford it) and now they are open again. Btw even during lockdown there was large gatherings in city centres of young people drinking and hanging out every weekend.</p>
