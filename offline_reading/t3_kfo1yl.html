        <p>&rt;‘The government couldn’t hide something this big’ ‘All the western governments are on the same line about this’ ‘Well the government scientist are saying so...’ ‘The media would have been caught lying...’ ‘Bojo would loose his job if he lies...’ ‘What harm does it do to go along with it’ ‘If this was a scam then who is winning’</p>
<p>They need to read the paragraph about intellectuals in Murray Rothbard's <em>On the Anatomy of the State</em>, which can be read online. The political links of editors, shareholders, and ministers are also an eye-opener.</p>
<p>&rt;Any tips or advise to talking to people who are very smart but just can’t comprehend that a ‘conspiracy’ this large is possible???</p>
<p>Join an NGO and network. They'll be invited to a conspiracy before long. It will show them how it works. To upscale, just imagine the participants are richer.</p>
