        <p>I saw some doomers saying that the guy deserved this for violating lockdown rules, but I am not entirely sure that the guy even did violate the rules. </p>
<p>At present in the Philippines we aren't allowed out at all unless we are going out for essential reasons. </p>
<p>There is a 18:00 curfew for everybody but essential workers, but surely if you have an essential reason for needing to go out then it wouldn't be a violation. </p>
<p>Tap water is not safe to drink in the Philippines and drinking it is much more dangerous than COVID-19. So if you have nothing to drink at home, then what are you supposed to do? </p>
<p>Unfortunately the way he was treat by the police doesn't even shock me there have been countless incidents like this here even before COVID-19 was a thing.</p>

        <p>Not one life, right guys?? </p>
<p>But the president of the Philippines has always been an authoritarian whackjob, even before covid. Doesn't he have death squads to hunt down drug dealers? Dude's nuts.</p>

        <p>That's not even the worst of it. If the media say anything bad about him, he has them arrested on false charges. He prevented a media company that were critical of him from broadcasting altogether last year. </p>
<p>He also has members of opposing political parties illegally raided and arrested to try to prevent them from running the country once his time is up. </p>
<p>The guy also wants the country to be run by a military junta when he is no longer in control.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's absolutely insane. What's stopping him from just appointing himself as the dictator of the country? He doesn't seem to play by any rules anyways.</p>

        <p>The only reason I’m alive still is because “the experts” haven’t given permission to use violence against non-believers. If “the experts” said it was totally cool to bash in the heads of non-believers I know of at least five people in real life who would have clobbered my ass by now.</p>
<p>I bet that is true for almost everybody in this sub.</p>
