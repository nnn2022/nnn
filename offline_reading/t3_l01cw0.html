        <p>Allow me to explain since you're obviously a little slower than most.</p>
<p>Doomers (like yourself) who are irrationally scared of Covid-19, will bounce around the subject of the new vaccines having damaging effects, including death, on some individuals. Doomers will argue, unsuccessfully, that it wasn't actually the vaccine that killed them when their body had an adverse reaction to the injection. Doomers will then try to make excuses of why they died.</p>

        <p>Confirmed Fatality Rate is when you put the absolute confirmed cases against deaths. Which in the U.S., that sits around 1.9% i think last time I checked.</p>
<p>Infection Fatality Rate is when you take the hypothetical case numbers against deaths. The CDC and WHO estimate 10x the amount of confirmed cases. Which would lower that fatality rate dramatically. </p>
<p>Now you could argue that we have missed deaths. My stance on that is with everyone so focused on Covid/Covid like deaths that our death number is much more accurate.</p>
<p>I have a source on the CDC estimating the 10x case count in a comment below</p>

        <p>I wonder if I’m the only one more concerned about being an asymptomatic carrier and transmitting the virus to someone who does end up being in that 1.9% group that actually dies from the virus essentially destroying their lungs. </p>
<p>Also, any pathogen that can cause more than 2 million deaths worldwide in a year is nothing to laugh at. The contagiousness of COVID-19 is the shocking part, having infected <em>at least</em> 96 million people worldwide in just over a year. Most likely more people considering the IFR is low meaning fatality rate is low due to many “healthy” people actually being asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>The virus can be anywhere. We need to do our part to stop the easy spread of the virus to stop the disease.</p>

        <p>&rt;The vaccine is a protein, not the virus.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah...and it's the first of its type to be produced, so it's <em>experimental</em></p>
<p>&rt;I will go ahead and let you know now how you will go.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Wet lung, popcorn sounds when you breathe. While your lungs are failing to supply oxygen, your hands and feet will suffer from poor circulation. Your mental state will collapse during brain fog. You will get blood clots and die of a stroke.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Maybe not the first time. Maybe it will be during the flu/covid season of 2029.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is actually RNA which codes for proteins on COVID. No actual proteins from COVID are being injected into you. 
That is literally how you’ll die. Would you rather have links to descriptions of COVID-19 deaths? They won’t be as poetic but they’ll get the same idea across.</p>

        <p>They wouldn’t count a death as COVID related unless the corpse tested positive for having COVID. And the people dying with COVID tend to be people with co-morbidities that  are exacerbated by COVID attacking their body. Yes, many people who have COVID don’t really get sick. But the people who do get sick enough to show symptoms and get tested are more likely to <em>die</em> from the infection. That’s what’s scary.</p>

This article doesn't mean anything because the primary endpoint in either studies wasn't PCR positivity, it was the existence of symptoms. You either have noticeable symptoms or you don't.

        <p>Actually, it’s the opposite. 95% of people did not test positive for COVID-19 by PCR. 19% of people did not experience symptoms which is not dependent on actually having COVID-19 but rather by severity of reactions to the vaccine causing flu-like symptoms often conflated for COVID-19 symptoms. So the 81% of people just had stronger reactions causing symptoms.</p>

        <p>Both my father and boyfriend felt like they had the flu after the second dose but they were ok after a day or two. My mother didn’t have any side effects from either the initial dose or the booster. Though it sucks, the scientists simply did not have time to create an equally effect vaccine against COVID-19 infection that did not cause so many side effects. This is because vaccines use adjuvants to stimulate the immune system to attack this tiny strand of RNA from COVID-19 which is too small to be recognized by our immune systems. If they had more time, the vaccine would not have as many side effects. It normally takes about 10 years to make a vaccine and they made this one in less than 1 year.</p>

        <p>The immune system doesn't attack the mRNA. The mRNA is incorporated into cells and makes them build a covid-19 spike protein and put it on the cells surface. Then the immune system recognizes the spike protein doesn't belong and builds antibodies to neutralize the spike proteins. </p>

        <p>That is true, but the adjuvant is necessary for the mRNA to effectively infect cells so the covid-19 spike protein can be created for our immune system to discover and create a defense against. With out the adjuvant, the vaccine would not be effective at stimulating our immune system because the mRNA would go undetected by our body. The adjuvant helps mRNA become an antigen, which is something our body recognizes as foreign. mRNA itself is too small to be effective so it needs help from the adjuvant to complete its job in infecting our cells.</p>

        <p>“A rough estimate of vaccine efficacy against developing covid-19 symptoms, with or without a positive PCR test result, would be a relative risk reduction of 19% (see footnote)—far below the 50% effectiveness threshold for authorization set by regulators.”</p>
<p>This is not saying the vaccine is 19% effective against the patient testing positive for COVID-19 using RT-PCR after a later exposure to the virus. </p>
<p>It is saying that the vaccine is 19% effective against developing COVID-19 symptoms regardless of testing positive or negative for the antigen (COVID-19). This means that the vaccine was 19% effective at preventing the patient from developing <em>symptoms</em>, not actual disease. Most vaccine reactions, if not caused by an overstimulated immune system, are caused by doing their job as a vaccine correctly. </p>
<p>The vaccine is trying to get your body ready for a fight. So when you get the vaccine, it teaches your immune system how to fight against an important receptor (antigen) for COVID-19 to infect people. This results in the flu-like side effects as the body amps up for a fight because it thinks you have been infected with a pathogen but really the vaccine is just delivering one antigen that cannot actually cause the disease on its own. </p>
<p>In this case, the COVID-19 antigen is RNA that codes for a receptor that the virus uses to infect the host’s cells. The RNA cannot change our DNA because RNA in any cell gets translated into a protein on the cell’s surface. Our DNA is transcribed into RNA before leaving our cell’s nucleus to therefore be translated into a protein. </p>
<p>If a patient has a severe reaction to the vaccine, it most likely is because their immune system is “allergic” to a specific antigen in the vaccine (like how some people are allergic to penicillin due to the fact that penicillin is foreign to our bodies and is therefore an antigen). This is no different than why some people have peanut allergies or hay allergies or any other thing that causes their immune system to amp up for a fight against something that is not actually dangerous like peanuts.</p>
<p>TL:DR - the 19% refers to protection (efficacy) against side effects. This is not the same as protection against later infection by COVID-19, which the vaccine is about 94-95% efficacious.</p>

        <p>Also TLDR: it’s not a vaccine if it doesn’t stop you from getting the illness. </p>

        <p>It is still a vaccine. By definition, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vaccine">it enhances our immune systems</a> to fight off the coronavirus as soon as it is recognized in the body. Vaccines that prevent infection (coronavirus from entering our cells) are very hard to make and are called “<a href="https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-few-vaccines-prevent-infection-heres-why-thats-not-a-problem-152204">“sterilizing immunity”</a>”. They are rare and prime the body so well to attack COVID that anything that remotely “looks” like COVID is attacked and destroyed as if it was COVID. You can trust that the host will not be infected by the virus again. </p>
<p>An good example of a vaccine closer to the full protection end is the smallpox vaccine. Initially, people were inoculate with cowpox which was a less severe and non-fatal viral relative to smallpox. They had such similar proteins on their surface since they were from the same family that a really effective vaccine against smallpox ended up just being an infection of cowpox. This is called “cross-reactivity”.  This occurs when the body sees something foreign, like proteins from peanuts or hay, and recognizes it as a dangerous protein like bacteria or viruses.</p>
<p>Basically, vaccines should stop you from getting severe illness and lower death rates. It is not required to provide full immunity. Most vaccines do not, but herd immunity helps keep those diseases in check.</p>

        <p>Here's the definition of vaccine:</p>
<p>&rt; a substance used to stimulate the production of  antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases,  prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a  synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the  disease </p>
<p>It doesn't stimulate production of antibdies, it's not prepared from the causitive agent of the disease, it's not a vaccine.</p>
<p>It's dubious, experimental medicine that the pharma companies have been trying to get regulators to pass for years and now these suspicious turn of events have finally led regulators to allow pharma companies to have a free for all. The flu jab this year is also an mRNA jab not the usual actual vaccine did you know that? They sneaked that one through now that the regulators won't stop them from experimenting on us.</p>

        <p>Here is the mechanism of action from the fact sheet provided by the FDA: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144637/download">“The nucleoside-modified mRNA in the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the nucleoside-modified mRNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19.”</a></p>
<p>The vaccine is prepared from a product of the causative agent. The disease is called COVID-19. The virus is called SARS-CoV-2. The virus causes the disease. The vaccine is made of mRNA that codes for an antigen on SARS-CoV-2. This results in our body producing antibodies against the antigen. </p>

        <p>That’s correct. The 19% refers to people who did not develop symptoms aka side effects after getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>If you really want to see how effective a vaccine is, you want to see how likely the vaccine will shield the person from infection and disease. A 100% effective vaccine would allow the person to literally make out with someone with COVID-19 and not get infected with COVID-19. This is almost impossible to achieve so I’d like 94-95% is good enough after spending 1/10 of the time normally spent developing and perfecting vaccines.</p>

        <p>As I’ve stated before they are counting test as positive cases. 
Any death in a hospital is counted as covid. 
You got 6 bullets in a gun. 5 of those bullets are long term killers. 
Heart related issue. 
Diabetes 
High blood pressure 
High cholesterol
Lung issues . 
Bologna 19 aka covid 19 shows up and aggravates or increase issues in one of the others. You die from the hospitals negligence when you come in for one of the other 5 bullets and catch the 6th bullet. Now they count the 6th bullet as the only killer when you’ve been shot 5 other times</p>

        <p>There’s many things to unpack here. I hope that is satire and not his real beliefs.</p>
<p>Prisoners on death row have their arm sanitized before getting the needle to prevent the prison being sued. If something goes wrong and a dirty needle was used resulting in the inmate getting an infection and suffering (which is not a humane death), the prison would be sued.</p>
<p>Honestly the answer to everything about cleanliness nowadays is based on not wanting to get sued. I ate at your restaurant and got sick because someone didn’t wash their hands after going to the bathroom? I’ll sue you into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Also is no one else grossed out by people not washing their hands after going to the bathroom, especially if they’re handling your food? I’ve gotten food poisoning before and I did not appreciate getting violently ill because someone was too lazy to properly wash their hands. </p>
<p>The whole middle part of the skit was basically about vaccines. Vaccines prime your body against attack. It’s like if Person A has an unloaded gun with separate bullets while Person B had a loaded gun. Who would be able to fight off an invader quicker? Person B can kill the invader as soon as he notices him. Person A has to load the gun first, which takes about a week or two in real life. That amount of time is crucial to defeat the virus out of existence.</p>

        <p>No. It's only something they say to point out the hypocrisy, if you say "20 people died of the vaccine"</p>
<p>They'll then say "they died with the vaccine, not of the vaccine" in an attempt to compare it to your previous arguments about the virus deaths</p>

        <p>Are there actually more or even close to as many deaths from or related to vaccination as there are from or related to covid? Genuinely curious, my understanding is that there are hundreds of thousands of people who died who had Covid in the us alone; if 24 people have died after getting the vaccine in Norway, even if their deaths were caused by the vaccine, doesn’t that mean that the vaccine is safer than getting Covid and therefore the lesser of 2 evils? Again genuinely curious, not really one of your crowd, but I’m a skeptic and want to question everything</p>

        <p>I think the point isn't so much about comparing the numbers, it's the fact that the majority of the covid deaths occurred in people who's bodies were already so frail that they were going to die from just about any little thing that came along that tipped the scale and their already failing bodies gave out on them,  whether that be covid, the common cold,  or even seasonal allergies. It's an argument we've been saying all along and have been called selfish monsters and grandma killers for thinking that way.  Now that people have been dying after being given the vaccine, the other side is saying the exact same thing we've been saying all along (that they were alreasy so fragile that the vaccine just happened to be the thing that ended up overloading their systems), but fail to see the hypocrisy in applying that logic to the vaccine and not to the covid deaths.  </p>
<p>Tldr: When it comes to covid, there's no such thing as dying of old age,  but when it comes to the vaccine, it's not the vaccine that killed them, it was old age.</p>

        <p>There's really not.  I mean they'll tell you otherwise because that's what fits their narrative, but really the total number of deaths for all causes across the board (non-covid related) are up this year.  Likely because people are neglecting routine medical exams, delaying treatment for other conditions, such as cancer or heart disease, and so sooo many mental health issues going unaddressed (suicides, alcohol related/drug related deaths). So when you actually factor in all of those higher death rates, the "excess deaths" are really not all that far off from the typical year to year deviation.</p>

        <p>Can you provide a source discussing this increase in death rate across cases, ideally with figures? I’m curious about the data and would like to find out more, all I could find when I looked was stuff about how the over all deaths have increased by a few hundred thousand, and how that could be accounted for by the number of alleged Covid deaths (this is in the us. I’m definitely interested in other community’s statuses and statistics, but I’m from the us and have read about my own country more than other places)</p>

        <p>I looked it up on the CDC website, it's difficult to find, but deaths from the typical big causes like heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory, accidental deaths..... All LOWER this year than last... By about 10% (except flu, down by about 95%) or almost 300,000 when they should actually have gone UP by about 3%(population growth).   If we applied those to the categories they are more likely from it leaves less than 100,000 due to covid related increases in deaths, which is like an extremely bad flu season where nobody got a flu shot. That checks out logically in that covid is about the same.</p>
<p>I know... I'll be flamed that it's worse than the flu, but remember this.  You can have ticks AND fleas. You can have covid AND flu at the same time, and your symptoms will be much worse than either of them alone. But the pcr test doesn't differentiate flu vs covid.</p>

        <p>It's been awhile since I looked at that specific data, majority of it came from the cdc itself, although they won't just put it out there in a neat little summary for you,  it actually requires you to do the math for yourself to see beyond the narrative that's being put out there. I'll try to find some links for you if you're truly interested in seeing the truth and not just arguing just to argue.</p>
<p>As far as the hospital thing,  look ill be honest,  I work for one of those "overloaded" hospitals, and once again, the truth lies in the actual numbers if you're able to actually see them yourself. For example is our icu over capacity right now? Yes, yes it is. And when the media reports that,  it's the truth. But what you don't hear is that the hospital only allocates 20 of it's beds to icu, and we're currently at 22 in the icu (because we do have the ability to convert some of the 200 non-icu beds to the icu when needed). However out of those 22 in the icu, only 7 of them are actually covid patients. The rest are just our normal everyday volume of icu patients. And as far as the rest of the hospital, outpatient is operating far below average, surgeries are also well below average, and the ED is pretty much the normal volume, which is actually odd considering you'd think we'd be getting a lot more sick people coming into the er during such a horrible pandemic, right? So yeah, there's the truth that you're told, and then there's the real truth that you're not...</p>

        <p>It's one example, and I can say with absolute certainty that it's the same exact story for at least 10 other hospitals in the area as well. And from what I've been hearing, it's the same thing for pretty much all hospitals across the country, however since I don't actually have that data to back up that claim, I stuck with the data that I can actually confirm.</p>
<p>It's obvious now that you're just here for the sake of arguing and don't actually care to know the truth, so I'm going to politely disengage from this conversation at this point.  Good luck out there!</p>

        <p>Governments are behaving as they do normally—reacting to the minority rule of those in complete panic coupled with the desires of the baby boomers (read: frequent voters) most likely to be harmed by Covid. </p>
<p>Excess death statistics are easily muddied. Excess deaths will be up in the future due to lost years of education, which has everything to do with decisions about lockdowns and remote school—but governments and idiots will paint this as an inevitable consequence of “necessary” lockdowns. The costs substantially outweigh the benefits at this point, but no one can ever turn a ship in any government, and outcomes many years from now don’t matter since elected officials terms should be well over by then.</p>

        <p>Why would any government ruin their economy? Why would all governments work together to push a false narrative? How come there isn't even one government out there that's saying that the pandemic is false, if you cent get them to agree on literally nothing else?</p>
<p>You'd think this would be a great time for North Korea to unmask the evil USA and show people how evil they are lying and whatever.</p>

        <p>Please answer me something: what will you do when COVID is fully controlled and there's no great reset and new world order? Because if there's a NWO and a great reset, I'm 100% gonna come back and apologize to you for being doubtful and ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>What would you do if it doesn't happen?</p>

        <p>It is unfortunate that this virus has ruined everyone’s plans and future. I’m a grad student and my classes which need to be very hands on (think surgeries) are all online. It’s going to take me years to gain the experience that COVID has cost me in the past year. </p>
<p>However, the possible increase of death due to loss years in education is preferable to more than 300,000 deaths in just one year with this virus.</p>
<p>Edit: almost 400,000 total deaths in the US, over 2 million world wide.</p>

        <p>Counting every death within 28 days of testing positive for COVID-19 as a death caused by SARS-Cov-2 is certainly not a perfect criteria, however using some maths you can prove that the vast majority of these deaths are infract caused by virus.</p>
<p>In the UK, there were <strong>616,000</strong> deaths in 2018. These can be classified as non-Covid deaths. 616,000/365 = <strong>1688</strong> non-Covid deaths per every day on average. 1688*28 = <strong>47,254</strong> non-Covid deaths every 28 days on average.</p>
<p>There are <strong>66.65 million</strong> people living in the UK, so 47,254/66,650,000 = <strong>7.09*10\^-4</strong> as the fraction of the total population that die every 28 days for non-Covid reasons.</p>
<p>As of 9th January there have been 2,957,472 positive COVID-19 cases in the UK. The fraction of these people that would be expected to die within the next 28 days from non-Covid reasons would be (as calculated) 7.09*10\^-4. This calculates to 2,957,472 * 7.09*10\^-4 = <strong>2097 people</strong>. This means that of the 79,833 deaths reported at the 9th of January to be caused from COVID-19 in the UK, 2097 were caused by non-Covid reasons, which is <strong>2.63%</strong>. This is a tiny minority, although an existent amount.</p>

        <p>This is a good way of putting it. Yes, some of the deaths put down as being caused by covid are not actually caused by covid. But more than 97% of the deaths (which is in the tens of thousands) worldwide each day are due to this virus, which is cause for alarm.</p>

        <p>You do know all COVID deaths aren’t elderly people, right? Some people simply had asthma and were only 30 years old. They had so much more life to give.</p>
<p>Your decision to go out without a mask impedes my decision to try to minimize contact with possible COVID positive people if we come across each other. Just like secondhand smoke, you do not have the right to potentially infect someone else and possibly cause their death just to protect your ability to”live your life”. You’re alive in both scenarios; I am only guaranteed a beating heart from one.</p>

        <p>Once again, actually read about this vaccine, it doesn't actually make ANYONE immune to covid, it's not even technically a vaccine. All its claiming to do is prevent people from getting any serious symptoms if they were to get the virus. It's essentially turning everyone into asymptomatic carriers that all you doomers like to constantly refer to as "super spreaders". You know,  the whole reason behind locking everyone down instead of just quarantining the sick. You getting this vaccine is not going to protect your 93 year old grandma from catching the virus from you.</p>

        <p>That brings up another benefit: someone who would have died from severe symptoms instead got the vaccine before being infected and only suffered mild to moderate symptoms. They are alive because the vaccine lessened the symptoms enough that they don’t kill them. (Fun fact: the virus itself isn’t the cause of death. It causes such an extreme immune response in your lungs that you basically drown due to blood in your lungs. Fun.)</p>

        <p>Then "those people" who can't get vaccinated should isolate until everyone has either gotten "it" or the jab, but let the people choose which method they want to use to achieve herd immunity.<br>
It's a strategy promoted by medical professionals, not some random idea. <br>
As infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists we have grave concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies, and recommend an approach we call Focused Protection.<br>

        <p>THE government? You think everything revolves around the US?</p>
<p>Here in Argentina, Brasil and many other third World countries, people are FED UP with this covid nonsense that halted our normal lives and pushed our society into the abyss of economic disaster. It wasnt this stupid pandemic but the endless lockdown (in Argentina schools are closed since March 2020). Millions most their jobs and the stimulus that our government paid to help people was 10.000 pesos (roughly 60 dollars every two or three months).</p>
<p>People disregarded their medical appointments because of this 99,97% survival rate virus and died from other severe diseases. Police brutality has increased in a dangerous way and many people were incarcelated for breaking the quarantine rules. In a little town a 10 year old girl was taken to the Police station for not wearing a mask. Thats pure insanity.</p>
<p>I live in this third World country and believe me we are scared of other things that are more dangerous than a flu. 
And maybe you have to think of obesity is the real enemy. Or is it just a coincidence that the country with the highest obesity rate is so prone to have so many "covid" deaths? 🤔</p>

        <p>The problem isn’t the lockdown; it’s how the economy is run. In a perfect world, we could lockdown and quarantine for a few weeks, everyone gets fed, no one gets fired, then emerge when the virus dies out without hosts to infect. </p>
<p>The survival rate is about 98% but more importantly over 2 million people died from it. The number of people dying due to missed medical appointments is important but also much smaller than 2 million. </p>
<p>You basically have to pick the lesser of two evils.</p>

        <p>A vaccine stimulates the immune system to create antibodies to fight against pathogens. Older people are more sensitive to immune system stimulation which is why they don’t get as many vaccines as other age groups. They are protected due to herd immunity, which can only be achieved if a certain number (let’s say 80% but it changes based on the contagion) of people are immune either from vaccination or previous exposure that did not result in death or chronic infection.</p>

        <p>Welcome. Maybe I can shed some light on this. </p>
<p>Despite what you heard on CNN, the anti-new-normal movement isn't about denying medicine or science. It's an opposition to an overtly authoritarian political climate that is following in the wake of this virus. </p>
<p>The reality is that the science is not complete. No one attempted to measure deaths caused directly and indirectly by the lockdown itself, including suicide, people losing their health insurance, substance abuse, etc. So to claim your lockdown is based on science is kind of bullshit. The cure very well may be worse than the disease. We'll find out in coming years.</p>
<p>Even ignoring that, science is not a basis for morality. Not sure why this is lost on so many people. Science lets us understand the world. It doesn't tell us what is right and what is wrong. Depriving people of their civil liberties is definitely wrong. We are not livestock. Not sure when demanding the right to our constitutionally guaranteed liberties became "ignorant" and "delusional". But history has shown us that if the government can disrespect those rights sometimes, you can't count on the fact that you have any rights at all.</p>

        <p>So in the time like this, when there are lockdown policies ensured all throughout the globe, you see yourself as "livestock"? Do you feel caged? Do you feel like some sort of political prisoner, in other words, do you feel "important"? Violation to your mentioned civil liberties is just because the earth is just that much populated. Just try to imagine what actions are necessary to control such a big population of humanity locally, nationally, globally. It is impossible to do this without breaching your civil liberty rule. The means to counter that have to be absolute and drastic, to give an idea that exploatation of the situation is impossible. If one person would be able to avoid it, he would influence many other to act in the same, for the society, unhealthy way. The idea of "disobedience to system" is very contagious, and especially at these times, disobedience is not an option. We are talking about peoples lives here. 
Yes, suicides, substance abuses, domestic violences etc in this case are unavoidable! What is the choice for humanity? To ensure the drastic policies which ofcourse has their downsides related to the very nature of a human being in 21st century (suicide, substances etc. like mentioned before)? Or maybe, we should just ignore the disease and spare the primitive need of socialisation of the people? And lets have a deadly virus spreading freely between us and our loved ones in hopes that it will dissapear? </p>
<p>For example, can you imagine what is it like to perform an eye surgery? And what does it take to know for all the thousand steps to peform this surgery? I don't, but atleast I can understand the complexity and need of knowledge to be able to do such a thing. Why do people think like they know all about covid? Do they feel like this just because they hear about this shit everyday on tv for the past 9 months and it is their unavoidable reality for this time period? Do you even have hobbies, interests etc besides ur 9-5 job, that could make you realise that things exist, which need years of studying and learning to be able to even begin to understand?</p>
<p>People like you, to me, seem like empty hoover bags who absorb every little thing that surrounds them, without having the choice what to even absorb. Pasionless. I don't mean to blindly insult you lot, it's just a picky methapor. Have you heard the phrase "the more you know-the less you know"? And can you grasp a meaning of it?</p>
<p>Once again, I am not trying to insult there, just stating my point of view. And I have never saw CNN news or channel (whatever it is) even once. I'm European.</p>

        <p>&rt;And lets have a deadly virus spreading freely between us and our loved ones in hopes that it will dissapear? </p>
<p>It's not a deadly virus. It's an extremely low IFR virus which makes it classify as a highly contagious but <em>mild</em> respiratory virus.</p>
<p>It's impossible for a low IFR virus to be classified as dangerous, because such viruses spread extemely fast and the majority of people who contract it only have mild symptoms or none at all (asymptomatics). That's what makes covid-19 a highly contagious but mild respiratory virus (if it was a highly contagious but highly dangerous virus it would have to have a significantly higher infection fatality rate - IFR).</p>
<p>Covid doesn't "kill" people because it is especially harmful of a virus. Covid "kills" by being too much for someone with a very weak immune system to handle...just like any mild virus can and does do. 
People who are "vulnerable" to covid, are also vulnerable to other causes of natural death that no one ever claimed to want to protect them from. The idea that covid is anything remotely like a death sentence for everyone who is elderly is also completely false. It's a complete misunderstanding of the nature of this virus and the facts of how elderly people, who have reached the end of their natural lifespan die.</p>

        <p>A couple things.</p>
<p>&rt; We are talking about peoples lives here</p>
<p>This is stonewalling. You really don't actually know for certain that we are saving lives. I could say the same thing about the lockdown. I'll give you a thought experiment to illustrate why our measurements make no sense. Imagine two viruses. One with a 100% kill rate, but it only activates 1 minute before you were going to die of other causes. And a second virus with a 0.01% kill rate that kills you in your 30s. Both highly infectious. Which virus is more "deadly"? No one would give a shit about the first virus because despite the high kill rate, the average loss of life expectancy for humanity is negligent. Same applies to COVID 19. Everyone touting the raw death numbers out of context. An average 80 year old has a 5% probability of death after contracting COVID 19, but also has a 5.6% chance of dying of other causes within one year. A 30 year old who has lost everything and kills himself has lost an average of 50 years. No one has even attempted to measure damage in terms of loss of life expectancy, and frankly, the data does not exist to make that prediction. </p>
<p>Second, for all the science that is said to support the lockdown, they have not considered the most important statistic of all: human behavior. Humans are not robots with a predefined behavior that can be predicted with mathematical models. Humans act. Unemployed people protest and riot, causing damages and spreading the virus. People frustrated with the lockdowns are now hosting "superspreader" events. You are absolutely correct when you say that humans can't be controlled. But we can lose our freedoms. Now we have the worst of both worlds. We've lost our freedoms and the virus continues to run rampant. I'd rather have the virus.</p>
<p>And again, I'm not a science denier. I have a background in STEM myself. What I am seeing right now is masses of non-STEM people and idiot politicians who don't even know what the scientific method is supporting the use science as a tool to give the state more power and shame the unbelievers. This isn't a fucking religion. No one has measured the concerns that I've laid out - not to mention economic and political effects which we know historically have ended entire societies. There are very valid philosophical reasons to be skeptical of the public policy that is being imposed.</p>

        <p>All of your points are valid. However, I feel like all the detriments of a lockdown are based on the fact that the way our economy functions is not optimal for protecting citizens from a pandemic. People are in trouble when they can’t work, therefore they are not making money. Until we move to a society that does not use money in the traditional sense, this will keep happening. Our construct of our economy is not more important than keeping people alive. More than 2,000,000 people have died worldwide, and not all of them were old people about to die anyway. This problem is a lot more complex than “the government is trying to control us”; the government has been controlling us this whole time by making us think we need to work 40 hours a week in order to be a good citizen.</p>

<p>The graph shows 2020 to be the highest, which goes against the "0 excess deaths mantra". A graph posted on Jan 11th.  Which is dumb when it comes to Sweden as they have a 3 week delay on death data.  Meaning numbers for a previous dates go up as time goes on.</p>
<p>Sweden ran out of ICU beds in Dec forcing patients to go without by being forced into lower inpatient care. And they still are currently well above the March/April peak as for Covid inpatient care.  https://www.svt.se/datajournalistik/corona-i-intensivvarden/</p>

        <p>Ok. I’m not saying covid didn’t cause any excess mortality. But if it’s such a deadly virus, why did Sweden do so well in terms of a percent increase in excess deaths compared to the US when Sweden had no masks, little distancing, and almost no lockdowns for most of 2020?</p>

        <p>I already told you they ran out of ICU units weeks ago, as they thought this was all over and so did not keep their temporary ICU units from March/April open. They are just now coming down off their worst Covid patient peak ever, a week ago.  And were looking for support from Norway and Finland to take in their ICU patients.  It's now a political scandal in Sweden for the Prime Minister and his hands off approach to Covid, and the top people in charge of managing Covid taking heat for being completely wrong on their herd immunity prediction.  Now even one of the young Swedish Princesses tested positive while pregnant.  And then you have the Swedish King calling Sweden's response a failure.</p>
