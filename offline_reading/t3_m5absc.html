        <p>With that logic you could likely claim that viruses themselves don't exist. Have you ever personally seen one? Sometimes you do have to trust in the science. There are limits, but you have to do it sometimes. </p>
<p>I've seen a number of Covid sufferers come into my hospital over the last year. There's definitely something different about this. It's been blown way out of proportion, but there is a new strain of something out there.</p>

        <p>how you can even get a single upvote is beyond me.</p>
<p>I had it.<br>
it is real. and the way it manifests is so easily distinguishable from any other sickness I had so far and so mind boggling its astounding that some people still claim its not real.</p>
<p>have you ever lost your sense of smell during a cold?<br>
imagine this happens to you without a runny nose.<br>
1 day just like that, boom, sense of smell entirely gone. like someone flipped a switch on you.<br>
not just lessened, gone. completely none existant. one of your senses suddenly stops working entirely.<br>
you don't feel different otherwise, just that 1 symptom.<br>
thats how it went for me.<br>
never in my life had I experienced something like that before.</p>
<p>its real, alright.<br>
its overblown as fuck, but its real.</p>
<p>don't be an idiot.</p>

        <p>I agree. Even despite my lack of denial of covid, I am open that I have had it, people at work look at my like I’m an idiot for not wanting to continue with the lockdowns and that I feel 0 need to take a vaccine. I’m sure that people like this are contributing to that heavily but even without them I think our views are still considered “dangerous”.</p>

        <p>the problem with these anecdotes is that they are anecdotes.  Loss of smell and taste and other ongoing symptoms are well known to happen with other illnesses.  Hell I had my joints blow up for a year, I thought I had an inflammatory disease for 2 years after a bad sinus infection.  Sense of smell and taste were affected.   Way pre-covid.</p>

        <p>Ok but I have had the flu several many times throughout my 30 years on the planet and I have never had that happen before, so it’s safe to me to assume that this was different. Now let’s expand that out to my friends who are of similar age and similarly have had a few flus themselves and had the same experience...now I’m pretty sure that there’s something slightly different about this flu.</p>

        <p>okay.<br>
its not like I never had any other desease that causes a lack of smell or taste. so trust me when I say that this was very, very, very different.</p>
<p>my nose was 100% open. I could breathe freely.<br>
no other symptoms. I felt 100% healthy.<br>
in the morning I could smell the deodorant I was using perfectly fine.<br>
3h later I was unable to smell BURNT MILK.  </p>
<p>nothing has changed. didn't feel different. nose was still clear.<br>
smell was simply gone.<br>
for my wife smell and taste were gone.<br>
should could drink vinegar and not be the wiser except for the stinging sensation in her nose.  </p>
<p>its bizarre and hard to discribe, but definitely easy to distinguish from any other desease I had so far that was causing a lack or reduction of smell and taste.<br>
very easy.</p>
<p>also, at which amount do anecdotes become medical evidence?<br>
before experiencing it myself I would not have thought the symptome of "lack of smell and taste" to be THIS acute. it was fascinating.</p>

        <p>first of all, is there any proof I can deliver that you would even accept?</p>
<p>fil and mil went sick.<br>
wife caught it with typical symptoms.<br>
I caught it from wife a few days later.<br>
kids got it from us a few days later still.  </p>
<p>like it normally goes for illnesses.<br>
also had my usual 2 days of back ache that I get with just about any virus infection.</p>
<p>the other symptoms me and my wife had were very distinguishable to anything else we ever had in our lives.<br>
most prominently the SUDDEN loss of smell and taste.<br>
this was different to the flu. no doubt about it.<br>
it was also way less intense. like the mildest cold I ever had.</p>
<p>do tell, what are these other possibilities you speak of?<br>
what else would it be than a virus?</p>

        <p>Of course I would accept proof if it was scientifically sound. There is no gray area here. </p>
<p>Epidemiological observations aka you, and your family’s symptoms, are not proof of a virus. Especially a virus that hasn’t been proven to be contagious, or cause disease
I’m not telling you that you are an idiot, or somehow less than myself, or anyone else. That is not the case. We’ve all been conned into believing in the false germ theory of disease. Covid made me realize that it’s all bs. So much of this makes absolutely no sense. I have no agenda here, other than to get  people to ask questions. </p>
<p>As far as other possibilities go, there are many things that could, and do cause illness. Toxic/poisonous chemicals in our air, food, and water.p Being poisoned could possibly cause all the same symptoms. Kinda funny how the word virus comes from the Latin virulent, which means poisonous. Radiation, both ionizing, and non-ionizing can also make you sick. They didn’t include these possibilities in their studies. </p>
<p>Look man, I have reason to lie. I’m just following what my heart is compelling me to do, because I feel that it’s the right thing to do. Question everything.</p>

        <p>theres questioning and theres being unreasonable stubborn.  </p>
<p>its contagious alright. scarily so.<br>
its harmless. or at least it was for us. 
I did not have contact with the person my wife got it from. neither had my kids.<br>
we all got sick aswell approximately 5days after she got sick.<br>
the other person 7 days before that.</p>
<p>enough anecdotes BECOME medical evidence. if enough people have similar experience then you can consider this scientifically sound.</p>
<p>if you don't believe someone whos on your side of the argument then I don't know if you will believe anyone.</p>

        <p>I dont think it's real tbh I think the figures come from statistical manipulation of regular illnesses and the more extreme symptoms like loss of taste and smell are caused by increased electromagnetic radiation frequencies as a result of 5G technology roll out. Before you flame me to death, the number of people showing those symtoms is ridiculously small, even as a fraction of people who test positive for the virus and loss of taste and smell and radiation induced pneumonia were hypothesised as symptoms of radiation poisoning even before covid. (read the Invisible Rainbow, about illnesses caused by electromagnetic radiation written before covid, it lists loss of taste and smell as a possible symptom)</p>
