    <strong>Love conquers all</strong>
    <p><p>Don't you see? The elite WANT us to fight amongst ourselves. Vaccinated against unvaccinated, black against white, man against woman, Christian against Muslim, it's ALL the same game to the criminal psychopath elites. They're doing this <em>intentionally</em> so you and I don't figure out the true source of the problem. Love yourself and each other! Love is the most powerful weapon against manufactured hatred in history! It’s difficult in such extreme circumstances, but we truly must. Humanity's future literally depends on it.</p></p>

        <p>I understand that, OP. I understand that divide-and-rule is literally the oldest trick in the politician's book, and I think what you're saying has a lot of truth to it.</p>
<p>With that said, if I'm in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, I don't even have to have anything against them. There's a very good chance that they'll want me dead pretty soon anyway, so it's not stopping me from defending myself if need be.</p>

        <p>I understand your point and even agree with you OP, but, it's easier said than done.</p>
<p>"It’s Easier to Fool People Than to Convince Them That They Have Been Fooled"</p>
<p>I literally live in a place where everyone is just so crazy about this virus shit, and my whole family, god, have been indoctrinated at birth basically, decades and decades of indoctrination from centralized mainstream media following the flow of society without questioning or asking, at this point nothing that say or show can convince them otherwise, and many others are exactly this way too.</p>

        <p>&rt;nothing that say or show can convince them otherwise</p>
<p>Now you've caught on to the biggest problem in our lifetimes. What could be the solution, other than love? There's no hiding humanity's ability to communicate with each other. Language is an extension of that ability, but how could two share in love, were it not for some subconscious medium of communication? True love cannot be expressed through language. </p>
<p>Now because love requires kindling, it can easily be ignored. It is not obvious that dry wood can be set ablaze, but you create a spark, and it sustains a fire. As someone who has witnessed holiness, it is impossible for me to explain how it starts. Yet I can explain how it works. When I follow the words of Jesus Christ, and apply God's subtle touch, my heart beats fuller and my thoughts grow wiser. When I am filled with anger and wickedness, I feel alone, and my mind becomes chaotic. </p>
<p>This is how I see the God: He who guides concious beings to unity through righteousness. For humanity, this starts with guiding the mind to unite with the body, the brain to unite with the gut, the heart to unite with its blood, and for the soul to unite with the person. All of these must occur under the guidance of a righteous and concious actor- I'll leave that to you to explore why that is.</p>
<p>So you can lead a horse to water, but what could make them drink? If something occurs in you that causes you to reflect, that may also occur in them as well. So if one human wishes for something to occur in another, what greater and more righteousness deliverance could be met other than by God the Father? If your wishes are not righteous, that righteousness actor will spite them. So let your wishes occur out of love, and have you plead your case in faith. Your heart is the beacon of your body, so <strong>take heart</strong> in goodness, and you will cause others to be lead with you!</p>

        <p>No. Your family does not want to listen to you, not because of indoctrination, but because when using their brains, they do not agree with your PoV on this subject.</p>

        <p>To everyone asking themselves why all of these things are happening, I truly believe this is the reason. Divide and conquer. Misdirection. They want to continue controlling the money supply, politicians, countries, narratives etc. When they can sense the populace is not happy then they set things into motion.</p>

        <p>I'm a black Muslim man. I stand with both good men and women, any race including white people, Christians as well as any other religion, and anyone I may have missed. And yes, I stand with the left wing, right wing, and independent constituents.</p>
<p>Don't fall for their divisive tactics and allow them to subsume your heart with hate. Love your fellow man as if they're family.</p>
<p>I don't care if you're a crackhead living in a trailer park or a hugely successful professional. You're worthy of basic human decencies and respect.</p>
<p>Afford others what you'd like to have afforded to you. No one has ever gone wrong in this world by doing so.</p>
<p>Authoritarianism relies on centralization of beliefs, political power, economics, and much more.  A decentralized world, where every person's God given rights are respected and upheld by every other person, is the right way forward.</p>
<p>Here's a little game you can make out of this: The next time you see someone with a diametrically opposing viewpoint to yours, ask them about it. Express genuine interest in your fellow man. Genuinely consider their points and see if you can understand them. Give some of your own viewpoints in a respectful manner and get a conversation going. You'll quickly notice going about life in this manner will grant you more respect and admiration from your peers, regardless of the topic at hand.</p>
<p>Again, I'm a Muslim. It is the biggest belief I have in my life. However, I've read the Bible, spoken to Christians, and I have plenty of really good non-Muslim friends. </p>
<p>I've even got friends that I wouldn't have expected to attract. A good friend of mine is Russian and had a very distorted view of Muslims before I talked to him. I also know a lot more about Russian culture as a result and I enjoy speaking to him about his experiences back home.</p>
<p>Some of my friends and family members were staunchly against having the right to refuse the vaccine. I've since changed some of their minds on this. I've also realized that many people are simply afraid and are trying to protect themselves and their loved ones. Other than in radicalized echo chambers like Twitter, most people are genuinely not trying to be malicious.  It's a give and take.</p>
<p>Take prejudice and bias as a challenge. Enjoy changing people's minds about who you are. Enjoy having your mind changed about the biases you've accrued over the course of your life.</p>
<p>My life is better because of this, without a doubt.</p>
