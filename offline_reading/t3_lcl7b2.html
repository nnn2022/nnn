    <strong>Why are people being crucified for "not wearing a mask" despite everything these same people passing judgement AREN'T doing?</strong>
    <p><p>So someone please explain the logic to me...</p>
<p>Let us assume that EVERYONE who chooses to not wear a mask is 100% doing it because they are completely self-absorbed and sociopaths (completely lacking empathy). So? You think SHAMING a sociopath is going to make them care? That's literally what a sociopath is...someone who doesn't care what you think or feel. </p>
<p>Also, since when did it become a crime to care more about yourself than others? If you subscribe to this point of view, then tell me, do you also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give to every homeless person you see on the street corner holding a sign that says "homeless and out of work"?</li>
<li>Please note, this is a number that has skyrocketed since the government shut down businesses. By your logic, you are ignoring them and are literally saying "I don't care about your misfortunes" or "talking to you is too uncomfortable and I value my own comfort more than yours".</li>
<li>Donate to the local food pantry as often as you can?</li>
<li>By your logic, not giving to a food panty is like saying, "you can starve for all I care." There are people who depend on these types of charities just to survive from week to week, a number that I once again assume has risen in recent times.</li>
<li>Wear a mask in past years during every flu/sick season?</li>
<li>Keep in mind, the flu is an ever mutating disease that no one is immune to. Excluding this past year where the flu has mysteriously killed next to no one, it was one of the most common killers of the elderly and compromised. Were you thinking about those people all those past years? Keep in mind (per a quick Google search) the flu can have up to a <strong>10 DAY</strong> asymptomatic period where you can spread the disease without having any outward symptoms, and potentially even longer via shedding? </li>
<li>*You can technically shed for even longer than the 10 days above. You also are capable of shedding the "flu vaccine" as well, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/background/safety-vaccines.htm">per the CDC.</a></li>
<li>This is also assuming the flu is the ONLY spreadable asymptomatic disease that you should have been "masking up" for in previous years. MOST respiratory diseases (including even the common cold) can have asymptomatic periods.</li>
<li>If you answered no to this, does this also make you a sociopath with no regards to the health and well being of the elderly/immunocompromised with this being the first year where you actually cared?</li>
<li>Donate blood as often as it is medically advised?</li>
<li>Trauma patients need blood and it is one of the most renewable resources that you can freely give. All it takes is \~an hour of your time. By not doing this, are you saying "eh, those people can die. They probably shouldn't have gotten hurt" or "my own time and discomfort is more valuable than your life"?</li>
<li>Volunteer for charities</li>
<li>Although the ethics and giveback of charities can vary, everyone no doubt has some cause that is very dear to them and a charitable organization associated with it. Do you volunteer your time for that charity? Do you give money to it? By not doing these things, are you saying "eh, it's not really THAT important to me"? Or, we could take it a step further; since you aren't volunteering for ALL these charities (included among these are: soup kitchens/food banks/homeless shelters/animal shelters/libraries/Red Cross/Habitat for Humanity/etc) does that mean all of these things means nothing to you and you hope they go under??? </li>
<li>Keep in mind that, while giving money is great and always appreciated, volunteering your time can be just as, if not, more valuable and is another resource that monetarily costs you very little, especially when factoring in how much you can help people who desperately need it!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many more examples of things an empathetic person SHOULD do if they truly care about people not dying or suffering. Many of these things are even less invasive on your everyday life and yet arguably so much more impactful than "wearing a facial covering". </p>
<p><strong>Does that make you a bad person who wants people to die if you don't do ALL of these things??? How are you better than someone who refuses to wear a mask due to their own discomfort or contempt towards them?</strong></p>
<p>I'll let the responses answer that question, because I genuinely want to hear the logic. </p>
<p>Apart from heavy pressure by the media and society at large, why are masks the topic that people are being crucified over and not (for lack of a better term) omission? Because let's face it, just "wearing a mask" is literally doing nothing. We could ACTUALLY be improving people's lives and not just virtue signaling.</p>
<p><strong>When did it become the most atrocious act in history to not do something that makes you uncomfortable???</strong></p></p>
