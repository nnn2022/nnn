    <strong>What are you not anti- other vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I know that the focus/goal of this subreddit is COVID 19 and how we should have the freedom of what we put in our body. This isn’t a vaccine debate subreddit. </p>
<p>But I see a lot of posts comments prefaced with “btw I’m not anti vax but… #{something about COVID vaccine}” 
And I can’t help but wonder….</p>
<p>We can see from the behavior of the government the past year, they could care less about our health. In fact one could argue they want us to be sick. So my question is, all the other vaccines that the government has pushed citizens to take in our history (flu, polio, measles etc) why did you think in that time they were doing it for our well-being? And we’ve seen this year how the media/government is willing to manipulate and lie about numbers. So doesn’t that put a question mark on all the numbers of individuals who have died from other  viruses in the past and the on the number of individuals who have been “saved” by the vaccine for that virus.</p></p>

        <p>As far as past vaccinations, they showed actual results and people weren't getting fear mongered into taking them? Polio-results were seen..Measles mumps and rubella...results seen...this shit..they act like it doesn't work! They promote continued social distancing if you get it! Why am I getting a shot when it's not effective?</p>

<p>Did you see these? Or is it something you read in a textbook? You missed the point OP is making, that now that we see how shamelessly they lie to us about our health, why would you trust any of the other disease stats?</p>

        <p>Outside of my generation I suppose. But at the same time when a disease is eradicated and no longer prevalent I would expect that means something was working. And in this case it was probably the vaccination for polio or smallpox measles mumps rubella..</p>

        <p>Do you understand just how many other factors changed in that time? Humanity literally went from cleaning chimneys, eating preserved month old food sprayed with DDT from cans, and walking in shit filled streets to an actual quality of life since some of these diseases were eradicated.</p>

        <p>Nope. These a actually declined not in correlation with  the vaccine and a instead with improved nutrition and sanitation and a decrease in poisoning the people with pesticides they were spraying in fruit. Read moth in the Iron lung and virus mania. Also read "What really makes you ill" . Your life will be changed. You were sold a lie by the wrong man why was a fraud. Pasteur won the day however bechamp was correct. you can start here. https://whatreallymakesyouill.com/germ-theory-html/</p>

<p>Some people just can't understand this. When my dad was a baby, there was an outbreak of polio in the town. I believe 6 children died. One being his brother (my uncle). The source of the outbreak? The water.  The local water supply was contaminated.  This was early 50's. And yes, I have news articles  about this incident.</p>

        <p>I can introduce you to some hillbillies that think God protects them from everything..they don't have teeth and Lyme disease almost killed the dad...but they believe in your shit too.</p>
<p>Bottom line, this covid-19 vaccination was rushed, it's not proven and the government is acting like it doesn't work when they demand further social distancing after being vaccinated and are discussing needing a third stab now.....why would any rational adult be getting stabbed with something that doesn't work and has proven side effects? </p>
<p>People die from vaccines everyday, but they have clinical trials for 10 years  typically and the side effects are well known before administering to the general public..this covid vax is tiring the general public into the guinea pigs...</p>
<p>In any cas3, I've decided I'm not qualified to be a guinea pig. My immune system is strong and I won't get the fucking shot. If I die of covid that's fine...it was my choice...</p>
<p>Back to the OP post....babies are helpless people. They are defenseless in the womb....what do you think they'd say if they had a voice? Do you actually think they'd forfeit their life?</p>
<p>My body my choice is more applicable now with this covid vaccine than any woman getting an abortion where an unborn child just get to be killed...without a voice or opinion...</p>
<p>I guess if you can't communicate we can kill you?? Let's apply this logic to any age...you're a mute? How about Helen Keller? Let's just kill them...it's the logic right?? </p>
<p>Life is beautiful ...who are you or a yone else to decide who lives and dies? Abortion clinics commit murder. And any asshole will say..."what about women who are raped?" I'll say ok, fair point, but that's something that should go to court...not a walk-in clinic on a Friday...</p>

        <p>No...some vaccines have changed the world...western medicine is to blame for the over population we see today..look at China with 1.7 billion people.

        <p>&rt;What are you not anti- other vaccines?</p>
<p>Because they're not being used as virtuous bargaining tools to "get your life back" and "be a good person".</p>
<p>Because I'm much more afraid of all the other things I've been vaccinated for, as opposed to this generally mild illness.</p>
<p>Because this vaccine is different than any other that's been developed.</p>
<p>Because I'm young, healthy, and unafraid of a virus with a stupidly high survival rate. Particularly since if someone is so terrified and paranoid, they can simply just take their own personal precautions (including taking the vaccine and staying home).</p>

        <p>COVID doesn't have the case fatality rate of a disease like Ebola. If there's an Ebola outbreak here in the U.S. (50% mortality rate), I think most of us would quickly get an Ebola vaccine.  With COVID, which 99% of people will survive from, I think it's pretty clear that the media has overblown this dramatically.  I got the Moderna vaccine the day after Christmas, and the rest of my family did, too. But I respect the choice of others who don't get it, too.</p>

        <p>I think in theory vaccines do work. I also know they can have side effects even though the medical establishment vehemently denies this, just like they are doing now. I also wonder… when I think about how the vaccine schedule increased from 8 doses to 72 doses (estimated; not sure of the actual numbers) over a 30 year period with no real testing… why is that?  Is that really about health? Or just profits?</p>

        <p>This vaccine is different then traditional ones, we still don’t know the long term effects. And as for short term effects almost every day there’s another case of someone developing some terrible condition. Then there’s the fact that this whole pandemic is being used for politic reasons. Also, the diseases that we’ve been vaccinated in the past were actually dangerous, covid is not, to the vast majority.</p>

        <p>Honestly if the covid vaccine was studied and tested as much as the standard required ones I wouldn't be nearly as suspicious. That combined with covid being a non issue in the vast majority of who it would be required for arouses suspicion. A week long head cold is not the same as a child dying or becoming permanently crippled.</p>

        <p>I am not really very strongly anti-vax. But what I AM is anti-coercion. I am against vaccine-status discrimination and the creation of a 2-tier society. I am against vaccine passports becoming ID-cards by stealth in a 'papers please' society. I am <em>broadly</em> pro vaccination. I accepted the AZ jabs because they are a new product of a mature technology - this seemed to me to be an acceptable risk. The mRNA jabs are not just a new product of an existing technology they a new product of a whole new technology. We have literally NO DATA on what happens if you give someone yearly boosters of these things. Perhaps that risk-benefit profile might be acceptable in the old and vulnerable for whom covid IS a scourge, but for younger people the risk-benefit profile could be different. But even if there were 50 years of data to prove these jabs make you live to 500 and shit magic rainbows and fairy dust that still wouldnt make all the coercion acceptable.</p>

        <p>Because they go trough much tougher 8-10 year testing where the majority get rejected instead of being rushed through in a fraction of the time. Also due to the potential RNA/DNA effects that are not fully understood.</p>
