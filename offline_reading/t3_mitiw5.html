    <strong>I took X vaccine, it really fu*ked me up... but I would do it again...</strong>
    <p><p>I am surprised by how many people in some of these covid subreddits are complaining about severe side effects, and asking questions which will inevitably be heavily monitored. Just got banned on the subreddit for letting a pregnant woman know that the drug manufacturers have zero liability if something were to occur to her healthwise.
You would think that someone who was in alot of pain after the first shot would be like... hmm let me really think about taking the second one...</p></p>

        <p>one of the biggest mind twists in our society is the concept of "side" effects. these are EFFECTS of poisons and toxins entering your blood stream, organs, muscle, tissue, etc. and your BRLLIANT body is screaming at you to tell you it's fighting for your life to heal and purge itself of these toxins. If we had all adopted terrain theory of medicine instead of the germ, we wouldn't be here and we would understand this is the body trying to clean its terrain. Instead we have this big lie in western medicine that is making people think the shot is "working" if i get sick... Psychopaths... Do not buy the cure from those who create the poision and make the profit.</p>

        <p>Interesting, I've never heard of the term "terrain theory", but I am likely a proponent and practitioner.   Your immune system only works if it is constantly exposed to the real world.  It works well if it is fighting foreign invaders it understands.  For new viruses and bacteria it has to learn their nuances, for others it has to adopt whole new tactics in order to fight them.  Regardless, your immune system needs target practice, and once it learns a new tactic it keeps it in mind.</p>
<p>I'm worried more about people who don't go outside, who won't shake hands anymore, who won't want to share food or take a sip of someone else's drink.  Those things are not gross, they keep us HEALTHY.  Play sports, have sex, go for a hike among the grass and pollen....heck get a bug bite once in awhile.  Life is good, we cannot live it in a vacuum.</p>

        <p>From John Blair....This is my current understanding based on all the research I've done into health, take it as such.</p>
<p>So lets start with what people call "infections"(illnesses caused by microorganisms), they are actually outfections where the body try to expel toxins that have been absorbed(air, food, water, medicines, vaccines etc) or created in the body by negative thinking(nocebo) and stress. The breakdown of these toxins creates symptoms but the symptoms have been mistaken for different illnesses when they're signs of detoxification and healing. The four methods of elimination are respiration, perspiration, defecation, urination where our body choose one or more to expel these toxins. </p>
<p>Our symptoms wrongfully called "diseases" like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer etc are all strategies that our body utilize to keep you alive. You can also look upon them as notifications sent by the body to you that says "listen, you need to correct your behavior and environment because things got out of balance". Once you corrected your behavior and environment these symptoms may disappear entirely dependent on how much damage you have caused to yourself.</p>
<p>Lets go a bit deeper and look at the two ideas that are at odds with each other and which one makes more sense to you.</p>
<p>The germ theory</p>
<p>This theory makes everyone victims of circumstance where everyone are ruled by their genes and their bad luck of having an illness(cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Polio, measles, covid). From this perspective the only thing you can do is to hand over your body and life to men and women in white coats who manage symptoms and prescribe toxic drugs but that know nothing about preventing and reversing health conditions. This perspective also chooses a chemical warfare program to deal with all symptoms wrongfully called "diseases" and it includes weapons of mass destruction such as antibiotics(against life), vaccines(toxins and foreign genetic material that kills people), chemotherapy(causes cancer and kills people), radiation(causes cancer and kills people) and various medicine(for each side effect there is a medicine and for every medicine there is a side effect that also kills people). This theory also treats everyone the same, there is no difference between you and I.</p>
<p>The terrain model </p>
<p>This model teaches people that everyone got full control over their own health that require no men and women in white coats or medicine to get healthy. It also teaches everyone that nobody is a victim of circumstance where nutrition and a healthy lifestyle(incl environment) is not only the key of preventing various health conditions but also a way to get back to health if one happens to venture too far out from what is considered healthy. Under this model it's well understood that our genes are the blueprint where our internal/external environment is the trigger meaning that how we choose to live our lives determines the outcome regardless(few exceptions) of what genes we are born with. This model treats everyone as unique individuals where there are multiple differences between you and I.</p>
<p>TL;DR 
The germ theory creates victims who feel powerless to do anything where their fate in life is decided by strangers in white coats and everyone becomes dependent on medical staff to "fix" their own mistakes. This promotes a health industry that cost trillions of dollars where the economic incentive is to make people ill, every new customer is a new revenue for big pharma.</p>
<p>The terrain model empowers people with knowledge of how to prevent and reverse most if not all health conditions on their own that promotes independence. This reduces the size and economic cost of healthcare and if done properly it would eventually lead to healthcare only taking care of people being in accidents. </p>
<p>Which sounds better to you and what makes more sense?</p>

        <p>philosophically is sound. but me as a person who works for their health a shit ton for YEARS.. am young and fit. covid came and i never in my life experienced such symptoms. how would you explain that? 1 of course there are still toxins or whatnot, radiations 2 why it targeted me alone .. initially, then it got to my girlfriend with the same symptoms .. and not her sister (that has a shit lifestyle)</p>

        <p>Each of us has a differently way our bodies purge toxins. Breathe, skin, bowel, urine. Depending on the health of your liver and kidney and the way you eliminate toxins, will determine how sick you get. Some of us have really strong elimination systems. Some of us don't.</p>

        <p>Because everyone responds  differently to emf or stress or poisons. Just like we all experience a constellation of symptoms when our body is healing- migraine, diarrhea, stomach ache. We each have different symptoms- while you may only have slight ringing in your ears, I may develop respiratory distress. Read  the invisible rainbow or what really makes you ill.</p>

        <p>They are useless.  There is no such thing as a pathogenic virus, no need to help the body fight off anything. We have been lied to. Think. If our own body creates pleomorphic cells that morph from bacteria to fungal forms to spores to phages to RNA packets that repair cells and then back again to a dormant state depending on the state of our own bodily terrain, than  what in the hell are people injecting themselves with and why? The whole germ theory crumbles away when we understand the truth of the natural biology of life.</p>
<p>This is why they need people to fear the germ. This is why they make cartoon viruses and falsify the evidence, to sell their snake oil and make trillions off the religious, cult-like lower mentality of the vaxxine believers.</p>

        <p>If you don't have any evidence then you are just talking about pseudoscience. Many scientists independently agree that the germ theory exists, and have agreed on this since the late 1800s.</p>
<p>If you had any of the routine vaccinations as a child and didn't suffer from chickenpox, measles, mumps, etc., then that is proof vaccines work.</p>
