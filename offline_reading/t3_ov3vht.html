    <strong>Plague years survival guide discussion</strong>
    <p><p>Since it seems we are gon get stuck in a loop of disease-&rt; vaccine-&rt; variants and the occasional natural disaster I just wanted to create a kind of list for stuff to have that might be useful. Basically doomsday prepping but only limited to realistic pandemics and people shit.</p>
<p>All this is based on the disease being legit dangerous but assuming that you cannot rely on or trust the government to help. Comment what should be added
List is organized by columns for diseases in general(D) airborne(A) and government shit and panicky hoarders(P)</p>
<p>(A) p100 respirator, don't wager with the plague using a thin ass mask. Use the good stuff for genuine protection and you can probably breathe through it better as well</p>
<p>(P) a spare tank of gas for your car. One of the most effective ways of enforcing lockdowns and quarantines will be to shut off access to gas needed to fly or drive long haul trucks. Not as important if you have an electric car. </p>
<p>(P) emergency food, water, medical supplies, and depending on location heating. People will panick if another plague happens, especially if the new one cooked up is even worse. Try not to be left out to dry if people hoard. </p>
<p>(D) for diseases in general you want to minimize touching stuff with your bare hands, gloves are advised.</p></p>

        <p>I think an electric car + battery pack + solar panel is a killer combo, and tesla sells all of them. However with all of it being “smart” and connected they could remote shut it off so maybe buy a “dumb” electric car (something cheaper like an e-golf) and dont connect the other parts to wifi or anything</p>

        <p>This. Don't trust anything "smart" to still work in case of a cataclysm or tyranny. Work for you as you want them anyway.</p>

        <p>Building solid local relationships with people in your community that you can work together/trade/provide security with. </p>
<p>Gaining knowledge and experience in at least one valuable area like gardening, mechanical repairs, medicine, water purification, childcare/education, cooking, etc. Have something of value to offer, ie, be worth a shit ;)</p>
<p>A deep supply (whatever is reasonably affordable for you) of things you use daily- non perishable food, clean water (better yet, the ability to make water clean), consumables, toiletries, medicines, etc. </p>
<p>Back up power, whatever might work best in your environment/what you can afford. Some places solar with power banks is the obvious choice, other places, not so much. You may not be able to afford a large system but maybe you can get some small battery banks so when you do have power, you can store enough to run at least your electronics when you don’t. Try to have some redundancies if possible (like a back up generator with stored gas and a few solar panels and power banks).</p>
<p>A good test is to shut off your power and don’t use the water for 24 hours and see how you do. You can find the holes in your plans and address them before a real emergency strikes. We lose power frequently and every time I learn something new.</p>
<p>Remember, even a little bit prepared is better than not prepared at all. I think sometimes we get hung up because we can’t afford 3 months of stored food all at once or don’t have the knowledge to build an off grid solar system, or can’t move to the country side. But every small action you take is worthwhile. An extra thick blanket and a lantern with batteries feels like nothing in the grand scheme of things, but being warm and having some light on a dark cold night is everything in that moment.</p>
<p>Edit: this is more general prepping advice applicable to most emergencies. For things like lockdowns and actually deadly disease outbreaks, the ability to stay home and lay low long term is important and the “deep supply” category will become number 1. But during such times I would expect frequent supply chain issues, problems with utilities, etc so all categories are should be considered.</p>
