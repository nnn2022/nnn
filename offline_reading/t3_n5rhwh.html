        <p>My take: I listened to the whole speech.  It's pure cringe.  Nothing but empty slogans and fake talking points.  Crist is one of the most synthetic candidates I've seen in a long time.  You have to be damn stupid to fall for Crist's shtick.</p>
<p>And although I feel fairly confident that De Santis will defeat this mannequin, it's on us to make sure Ronnie D smashes Crist into oblivion. This race is probably going to be the first real referendum on COVID policies, so it is IMPERATIVE that Crist be overwhelmingly defeated and humiliated.</p>
<p>Things you can do:</p>
<p>Follow De Santis official pages on social media.  Like and/or upvote his social media content.  Costs nothing, but still helps De Santis.</p>
<p>Donate to De Santis.  Even if you can only donate $1, you should still do it.  It's always good when a candidate has lots of small donations, because it shows real grassroots support.</p>
<p>Volunteer for his campaign.  Lots of ways to do this.  From as little as mailing campaign literature to as much as knocking on doors and registering people to vote.  Again, every little bit helps.</p>
<p>Make and share pro-Ronnie memes.  If nothing else, this should be done for the pure lulz.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>So let's make sure the giant poser, Crist, goes down in flames, and that our boy, Ronnie D, emerges victorious.</p>
<p>KEEP FLORIDA FREE!</p>

        <p>Crist is on Crack if he thinks he can topple DeSantis. Ronnie D has become the most popular Governor in Florida since Bob Graham, which was a LONG time ago.</p>
<p>Floridians are on pins and needles, understanding that DeSantis has a legitimate look at 2024 for President, at this point. That would leave quite a hole. My vote would be for Adam Putnam for Governor at that point, but it's still way too early to make calls like that. Either way, Ron has definitely surprised me. Didn't think much of the guy when he first got elected, but he has blown me away with his willingness to act like an American. </p>
<p>God Bless Florida! He can do what He wants with the rest.</p>
