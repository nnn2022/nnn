    <strong>"Today in Russia, Tomorrow in America"</strong>
    <p><p>This a modern saying among Russian Orthodox Christians. I won't go into deep detail about the Bolshevik Revolution, but I will say this - it was funded by western powers. Particularly the banking establishment. It was not an organic grassroots revolution of regular, fed up Russian citizens. There is no such thing as a "grassroots revolution", whenever you hear about a "grassroots revolution" or "revolution of the people" you should always look into who funded them, armed them, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tofMFjuTH0A&amp;list=PLCFiE3qfVkDiVAOrCRe6JpYDMnlRSWxE-">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tofMFjuTH0A&amp;list=PLCFiE3qfVkDiVAOrCRe6JpYDMnlRSWxE-</a></p>
<p>This is a playlist of talks done by Fr Peter Heers, a Greek Orthodox priest, about the tribulations of the Russian Orthodox faithful during the Soviet days - the so-called "New Martyrs". It focuses on the early decades of the Soviet Union when the greatest mass murders were perpetrated against the Russian people by the banker-funded regime.</p>
<p>I'm posting this because America, and perhaps the western world in general - America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Western Europe - are undergoing their own equivalent of a Bolshevik Revolution. Not exactly the same as what happened in Russia, but there are striking similarities. The global banking cabal behind this is not committed to marxist ideology.</p>
<p>Marxism is just an experiment of theirs, and so is capitalism and fascism. They do whatever works, whatever aids them the most in degrading ordinary people. Degrading our physical, mental, and spiritual health. Making us as vulnerable, as dependent, as bestial and infantile as they possibly can, so that we can be controlled more easily. </p>
<p>If you're hoping for a political savior who will rise to power out of nowhere, and magically undo all of this and create a utopia, you are fooling yourself. Ultimately our problems are spiritual in nature. These tyrants are powerful because the average person has become degenerate, and willingly gives themselves over to the tyrants. They outsource their free will to people who despise them, and in fact, despise of all of humanity. </p>
<p>The true leaders of the world, international billionaire businessmen like the Rothschild and Rockefeller families, see us as nothing but animals who exist to serve them, and be discarded when we are no longer useful.</p>
<p>The only way to defeat these tyrants is to make the average person strong again. Make them less dependent for goods and services, make them more disciplined and ascetic, make them more informed and discerning. It's not enough to simply elect a person like Trump and wait for them to fix everything.</p>
<p>I hope that at least a few of the people reading this will take the time to listen to Fr Peter. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.</p></p>
