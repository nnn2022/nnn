    <strong>There’s a war going on right now, and almost nobody knows that they’re in it.</strong>
    <p><p>The powers-that-be (PTB) were able to con us into killing our brothers and sisters for thousands of years before this crisis happened. Most of us went along with it then, in some way — even if we weren’t the ones holding the swords — and many of us are still going along with it now. However, it was easy to recognize: It was loud. People got shot. Things got blown up.</p>
<p>However, this new war in which we are being sacrificed — knowingly or not — is unlike anything most of us imagine it to be. It is not fought with bullets or bombs, tanks or airplanes, and, for the most part, it doesn’t even make any noise. It is a silent war, using <a href="http://www.stopthecrime.net/docs/SILENT%20WEAPONS%20for%20QUIET%20WARS.pdf">silent weapons</a>, that is being fought against (supposed) invisible enemies.</p>
<p>&rt; “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.” – H.L. Mencken</p>
<p>To an untrained eye, the fact that this silent war even <strong>exists</strong> might very likely go unnoticed. How, then, is anyone supposed to strategize and mount an effective resistance when they don't even know the nature of their enemy? When they believe that it's all happening by chance? When they believe that the tentacles of the establishment — the government, the media, the drug companies, the multinational corporations — have their best interests at heart?</p>
<p>This new vaccine (a silent weapon), claimed to fight invisible enemies (viruses) is one of the most powerful weapons in the tool kit of the establishment. Not because of the amount of damage that it does (which varies between individuals), but because of the fact that <strong>we believe it will save us</strong>. It is this belief that is the core deception of the silent war. Ever wondered why it is that vaccines are so cheap?</p>
<p>&rt; "The money isn't really to be made in the vaccine industry. The money is made by Big Pharma with all of the drugs that are given to treat and address all the illnesses that are subsequent to the side effects of the vaccines." – Dr. Sherri Tenpenny</p>

<p>Viruses, germs and disease (in general) are not what we think they are. The masses have become hopelessly brainwashed, and perpetually fearful, all over a threat that has <strong>never been proven to exist</strong>.</p>

<p>The masses, like cattle being led to the slaughterhouse, will, for the most part, never see their prison, or its guards, for what they are. Not until it is too late, anyway, and there is little that any one person can do to stop it. My relationships with my family and friends have all suffered as I tried, seemingly in vain, to warn them about the reality of this “pandemic” and the Hell on Earth that the PTB are creating for us. In almost every instance, I am met with skepticism, hostility and/or silence, and I’m sure that many of you can relate to this in some way.</p>
<p>I really want to be wrong about all of this – more so than anything else in my entire life. However, based on what I've learned so far, I don't think that I am. At this point, all I am left with is (1) channelling my anger constructively – taking concrete steps in the here and now to ensure the health and safety of myself and my loved ones – and (2) prayer, because it seems like nothing short of a miracle will open their eyes.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks for being here. While you may be struggling, and asking yourself why you're even trying, always remember that you're not alone and that your voice matters, even though it doesn't seem so. If you want to know what happens next, as I do, then just being here is enough. Believe in yourself, and your ability to change things, and you just might see it happen.</p></p>

        <p>The police state and surveillance apparatus now in place in most countries around the world exists primarily to detect, neutralize and prevent such plots from materializing and being executed.</p>
<p>We're all angry. We all want someone to blame. We all want to lash out. I'm not completely immune from any of this, nor do I pretend to be. However, it's important to realize that anger is a trap, one into which the PTB want us to fall.</p>
<p>What do we do instead? Whatever we can to ensure our own health, safety, sanity and survival. If you can take care of yourself, you can take care of others, and, when the time comes, they will be looking to you for a leader.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, the one thing – the silver bullet – that stops this agenda dead in its tracks is mass non-compliance. There won't be enough cops to arrest everyone if that happens. Is it likely? I don't know. Is it possible? You'd better believe it.</p>

        <p>It's a good story, and all, and I'd certainly like it to be true. However, by your own admission, it's not one that can be easily proven unless one is an active participant or has the ability to see reality in a way that most cannot. Until then, what choice do I really have but to stick to the path I'm on?</p>

        <p>This sub is filled with people who are skeptical of all the public "health" mandates being imposed on us, and the lies and contradictions built into them, which is definitely a good thing. However, one of the hard lessons I've learned about people in general is that they tend to stick to the path of least resistance. They want the easy answers, and not the hard questions. They want people to tell them what they want to hear, and not what they need to know.</p>
<p>I haven't received much encouragement at any point along this journey, nor did I expect as much, but it's always nice to hear. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I'm not really on board with the exosome theory proposed by Dr. Kaufman and others.  The world is full of organisms invading or eating other organisms, with parasites of all sizes and variety in existence looking for a host.</p>
<p>They would also have to explain how viral challenge studies would work if a virus could not be a disease causing vector. </p>
<p>But nevertheless well said.</p>

        <p>That's not what I said. Just so nobody is confused, I'll restate the relevant passage of my post to which this is referring:</p>
<p>&rt; Viruses, germs and disease (in general) are not what we think they are. The masses have become hopelessly brainwashed, and perpetually fearful, all over a threat that has <strong>never been proven to exist</strong>.</p>
<p>To claim that viruses don't exist is misleading. We've taken images of them using electron microscopy, so we know for a fact that <em>something</em> is there. However, what is even more misleading, and dangerous, is for health "authorities" to claim that they are pathogenic (disease-causing), despite the fact that the mechanisms by which this occurs have never been demonstrated.</p>

        <p>As others have stated, whether it exists or not isn't as much the issues as the/your governments response to the perception of its existence. It's the governments that are killing high street, taking/removing the jobs, locking you under house arrest, etc.. not a virus. A virus isn't doing any of this. The people you believe you voted for are.</p>
