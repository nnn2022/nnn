    <strong>The New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanted to make it crystal clear to the Corona crew and doom-squad vigilantly patrolling our subreddit exactly what it is they're defending when they downvote us and wish death on us, our families, and friends whilst massaging their grubby, dusty little chodes like some sort of neckbearded, obese, asthmatic Aladdin furiously rubbing the Genie's lamp for three wishes. So here's a vision of the future, our "new normal", as it were.</p>
<p>First off, Gram and Gramps are fucking dead. Congratulations. Game over. No more bimonthly zoom calls. Your quest has failed, and you've spent the last few years denying them human contact to rescue them from a "deadly virus" with a 99.7% survival rate, entombing them in care homes to be worshipped from afar and die in isolation like pharaohs buried in their pyramids. Oh, and it wasn't COVID that killed them. It was one of the other million viruses, diseases, or sicknesses that float around this putrid planet, or, you know, died from old age or their body deciding to crap out. Life comes with risk and death is inevitable, to deny that is to deny reality.</p>
<p>The government can now lock down whenever they like. All they have to do is announce a new strain or virus and dangle a vaccine in front of you like a rotten, worm-filled carrot and you'll happily hand over whatever meagre freedoms you have left to have them stick that saline carrot up your puckered arse. The instinct will be so ingrained by this point that you'll feel your chocolate starfish excitedly yawning open into a desperate gaping maw the moment the news of COVID-34 reaches you via your fucking jittery, hypochondriac aunt's Facebook post.</p>
<p>By the way, I hope you had a partner before all this, because dating will either be a thing of the past, the "old normal", or some weird fucking match-making service where you're assigned a suitable mate through a fucking algorithm, meet up for a socially distanced date, and then have socially distanced sex with your four government-mandated face-masks on. I'm not sure exactly what "socially distanced sex" entails, perhaps a glory hole and a fuck load of condoms wrapped round your suffocating member, but I'm fucking sure they're working it out right now.</p>
<p>Free speech and freedom of any kind will be a thing of the old normal, too. Books will be burnt, films and TV shows will be altered, and people will disappear for expressing thought-crimes, cancelled from life itself. This is a concept infinitely more terrifying than this pAnDeMiC. Right now this subreddit is under threat of being taken down, for - wait for it, I'm actually gonna be sick... - WANTING THINGS TO GO BACK TO NORMAL!? The horror... what a bunch of sick sociopaths we all are. Shame on us, guys.</p>
<p>Fuck sake, if you think we're the villains you need to take a good look in the mirror. Either you assholes have been huffing in too much of the bullshit and carbon dioxide you expell because it just bounces right back in when it hits the sweaty fabric mesh wall of your face-diaper and it's somehow eroded your brain beyond rational thought, or you are just seriously delusional. When was the last time you saw the hero of a film or book DEMAND the villain to wear something or stay inside, or outright tell them to go kill themselves just for wanting to see their family and friends? Even the term "plague-rat" sounds like something a villain would say. You don't see us forcibly ejecting people from stores or ganging up on the elderly for wanting to live their lives.</p>
<p>You will never see your family or friends again if we allow this bullshit to continue, but unfortunately I think we are beyond the point of no return. You have told the government you are okay with being cucked into submission, content to peek out through the closet door as it aggressively rails your livelihood, mental health and freedom on the bed and shits all over it. Well, you made that bed: now fucking lie in it. Even if this shit ends, these pussies need to be held accountable and answerable to the moral and life standards they have set for themselves and everyone else during this whole charade. They should wear a mask for the rest of their life and stay locked away from the rest of society by their logic: YOU COULD UNKNOWINGLY PASS SOMETHING ONTO SOMEONE AND KILL THEM, YOU KNOW! SELFISH! </p>
<p>I could go on but this post would be longer than the fucking lockdown they intend to keep us in right now. Point is, why the fuck would you defend something so horrible and dystopian? You defend that, and you defend the impact this horse-shit has had on our mental health, economy and the very way we fucking live our lives. You have snuffed out thousands of years of progress to protect a few old people who were probably one foot in the grave anyway and denied them the respect, companionship and humanity they deserve in their final moments. But fuck it, gotta virtue-signal, gotta look like you care, right? Wrong. Do us all a favour and grow a sack.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope this community continues to thrive. We are the last bastion of sanity and reason here. But they are coming for us, subreddits dedicated to tearing this place down for "hate speech" (frankly haven't seen any of that, unless you count doomers and Branch Covidians), and before long they'll probably get their wish. What a sad state of affairs. Can't imagine it'll be too long before the thought-police come to take me away, or just sneak into my house while I'm at my computer and outright plant a bullet in my skull midsentenhuwshbdsbhduen</p>
<p>DISREGARD THE ABOVE MISINFORMATION, COMRADES. WEAR A MASK. REMAIN INDOORS. PROTECT GRANDMOTHER. FLATTEN THE CURVE. SOCIALLY DISTANCE. I, COMRADE SICK MAN, WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME.</p></p>
