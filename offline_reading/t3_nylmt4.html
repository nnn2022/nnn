        <p>There are a number of treatments that "prevent you from dying"</p>
<p>Some of which is not being a diabetic fatass over the age of 60</p>
<p>If ivermectin/hydroxychloriquine are effective treatments for reducing the severity and duration of symptoms,  then any reasonable person would find the vaccine pointless.   </p>
<p>Hospitalisation usually occurs when the infected person has existing comorbidities which in themselves are already a risk to life - and in those cases ivermectin has been shown to reduce the severity of covid-19 symptoms to the point that hospitalisation is not required. Again, negating the utility of a vaccine.  </p>
<p>If there are treatments with decades of use in humans and a large dataset showing human use is safe what is the point in forcing a new, untested (by comparison to <em>any</em> other vaccine) medical treatment that has literally <strong>no long term data for efficacy or risk</strong>?</p>
<p>Oh that's right, we have to "follow the science" by first throwing out anything that invalidates the usefulness of the vaccine</p>

        <p>We now have people who have been vaccinated for nearly 15 months (the phase trial testers), and it seems like the only result coming out of it is that the vaccines provide long lasting immunity to covid19 and its variants. What else would you even be worried about, the injections are like what, 100 microliters? If you think whatever is in the shot stays in your body for more than a week you are a fool plain and simple. It just primes your immune system and gets peed out afterwards.</p>
<p>And yes the original studies were to see if the vaccines could limit the life endangering severity of infection, but guess what, bonus! Not only does being vaccinated reduce the severity of the disease if you do get sick, it also significantly reduces your ability to infect others if you do get infected.</p>

        <p>How would you have immunity without the shot? Unless you mean natural immunity but that comes with a chance of death so why risk it.</p>
<p>Heres a basic reason: get vaccinated so you a much lower chance of getting infected. The more we limit total infections (yes even the asymptotic and less severe infections) the less chances the virus has to mutate to form new variants that may very well one day overcome the current vaccine derived immunity</p>

        <p>&rt;How would you have immunity without the shot? </p>
<p>The mere fact that you asked that question means you know absolutely NOTHING about how the immune system works.  Go read a book and learn something.  You have the entire internet at your disposal which contains everything there is to know on how the immune system works all the way down to the molecular level.</p>
<p>I went to college and learned all about how it works.  You can do it for free.</p>

        <p>I’m actually in a microbiology phd program at the moment. Its pretty clear you do not know what youre talking about. Although micro and immuno arent the same field, i have taken multiple human immunology classes the past year. If you message me a gmail account, id be happy to give you the janeway 9th edition Immunology textbook that the field currently uses in pdf format.  </p>
<p>However i will warn you, it does not at all support whatever misguided misconceptions you currently are toting, you cant be immune to something without having had the illness or being primed by a vaccine at some point. I mean, i guess you could look at the chapter on antibodies in breastfeeding newborns that they acquire from their mothers milk, but thats mostly to help them establish their gut microbial populations for efficient digestion as their diets change.</p>
<p>You truly dont know what your talking about, if you claim you learned this in your college, nice self burn because its either evident you slept through class or were a econ major that took intro bio and thought you were better than the premed students already</p>

        <p>Wait...</p>
<p>You're a microbiologist and you have no idea how someone could possibly become immune to a virus without a vaccine?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>So.... before vaccines, human beings just all died out over and over from viruses?</p>
<p>You actually believe that?  Is that what they're teaching in college now?  Because I took some medical courses too for my career and we learned something WAY different.</p>
<p>Seriously- you really think immunity is impossible without vaccines....  That's what you believe...</p>
<p>Okay!</p>

        <p>It looks like you are confused about what immunity means... When people talk about vaccination and becoming immune to particular viruses/bacterial infection, they are usually talking about your adaptive immune system. These are the B and T cells that can specifically recognize/create antibodies for specifically binding components of the virus particle (or whatever antigen) itself to inhibit subsequent infection cascades. You might be thinking of innate immunity, which is like your phagocytes (dendritic cells, neutrophils etc) that are capable of recognizing any virus/bacteria nonspecifically (and killing them by their way of digestion), but their main use is to break down the virus into smaller antigenic components, and to shuttle these pieces to your lymph nodes to allow B and T cells sample the antigens until one of them with the correct B and T cell receptor that can actually bind strongly to the antigen are found, and the particular lineage of adaptive immune cells can proliferate to be used for the infection. </p>
<p>Your adaptive immune system will not in any way be inertly immune to anything unless you at some point have gotten infected by said pathogen beforehand. It is not magic. Even with vaccination it takes several days for the correct b and t cell receptors to be identified for priming of the antigen that is seen in the virus. Your innate system is nonspecific meaning it will go after every virus/ bacteria in your body, but your innate immune system is usually not sufficient to overcome something as serious as covid19. </p>
<p>Again, dm me your gmail and I can send you Janeway's 9th edition immunology textbook through google drive. Its usually a couple hundred bucks but Ill give it to you for free if you actually want to learn about immunology so you can stop preaching these misconceptions.   </p>
<p>Also, I really suggest reading "Gun Germs and Steel" by Jared Diamond, great read. It actually talks about one of the things you mentioned:</p>
<p>\&rt;So.... before vaccines, human beings just all died out over and over from viruses?</p>
<p>Uh yes, absolutely, nearly all history textbooks talk about this extensively. Humans died at incredibly high rates before vaccination and modern medicine. Thats why people had like 10 kids in the past, because 6 of them were going to die before they reached 18. I think like 50% of all of europe died from the bubonic plague during the dark ages. The book I referenced above shows that nearly 96% of all native americans (north, central and south america) died to smallpox after it was brought from europe (usually only a 33% mortality rate but since they had 0 exposure to smallpox beforehand they had nearly no immune individuals in their population). Considering that they had a population of 112 million native americans total before europeans arrived, 107 million people died to the disease. Those that were left over mostly interbred with their colonialist, whose offspring were better primed for old world diseases. Hey but smallpox isn't around anymore, so the mass deaths led to that right? NOPE, it wasnt until the first vaccines that smallpox was eradicated from the world at large.</p>

        <p>Modern medicine is not magic. Doctors starting to washing their hands between patient births greatly decreased infant deaths due to infection (which is practically common sense now). </p>
<p>You realize vaccination is also part of modern medicine right? Its not like we eradicated smallpox or polio with medicine. It was all vaccination, 100% (and yes quarantining as well). We vaccinated in mass for multiple years in a row, until the cases dropped to 0. We eradicated smallpox worldwide. Polio is still out there in the less developed world but it looks like its heading out the door too. </p>
<p>Vaccines for Covid19 have the huge benefit of being 90% effective and higher, meaning we could definitely eradicate it off the planet if everyone got vaccinated (comparison of the original smallpox vaccine that was basically smearing pus from cow pox into open wounds of children which was still seen to be 30-40% effective and STILL helped eradicate it from the world). </p>
<p>The only argument for not getting vaccinated is if you actually want it constantly in circulation, giving it more opportunities to mutate to new strains that our vaccines cant protect against. Do you actually want it to become like a epidemic flu strain that pops up every 5-10 years and starts this headache all over again?</p>

        <p>I never said it was magic, did I?</p>
<p>Also, you're completely wrong about vaccines.  They are not needed for immunity and never have been.  The vaccines before this one (as in we're NOT talking about the mRNA) simply provide the body with a template and the immune system responds as it would against the real thing.  </p>
<p>In the wild, if the virus doesn't kill you, your immune system will fight it off.  And it will do so again and again and again from that point on.  You don't need a vaccine.   The vaccine just makes that very first time easier on the body. </p>
<p>Yes, I know about B cells and T cells I've taken the medical courses too.</p>
<p>I seriously do not know how you made it through your classes though unless you do know the truth and you're just lying about everything now in order to push people to get that damned mRNA vaccine.  It's not going to work.  I got exposed to covid a year and a half ago and I've been fine ever since.  It made me exhausted for a day.   Big fucking deal.   And I worked in a hospital that entire time so it's not like I was hiding from it.  Covid failed to kill me the first time so there is zero chance of it doing so now. </p>
<p>One of the benefits of being a world traveler in the military is a strong immune system.  I've been exposed to way scarier viruses than covid and I wasn't even vaxxed against most of them. </p>
<p>You seem to think that the world only has a few viruses out there and we have a vaccine against everyone of them or we'd die.  That's not the case and if you were REALLY a microbiologist, you'd know that.   There are more viruses out there than we can count and that will never change.</p>

        <p>You might want to reread my comments, i never said vaccines are the only source of immunity, but its a way to become immune without danger of an actual infection. If you look at your own comments above, people were arguing because you kept repeating that nearly everyone was already immune without the vaccine, and in fact, you meant everyone that has had covid is now immune. This is true to an extent, although we have seen people getting reinfected a second time in some occasions. But surely you must realize the mentality of the 70s and 80s, where parents would invite kids over for chickenpox parties was absolutely ridiculous. Why put loved ones at risk when you can get something just as effective, without the added risks? </p>
<p>I guess i wont be able to change your mind, so ill leave you with this, the reason most people get upset that a minority proportion of the population does not want to get vaccinated is because 
1. Immunocompromised individuals who cant get vaccinated still have to go about their lives just like everyone else. Now that we know vaccinated individuals have decreased chances of transmission of the virus as well, its important to get vaccinated to protect these members of our society. Its basic human empathy. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Coronaviruses have a low mutation rate, but every subsequent infection gives its chance to gain mutations. This is why there are the south african, brazilian, and indian variants out there. The brazilian in particular came about because the nation essentially chose the “herd immunity”strategy and the sheer number if corona cases led to the variant popping. Vaccines work now, but it could just take one person to start us back at square one, and that includes everyone with “natural” immunity that youve mentioned too, their immunity is not guaranteed for these newer variants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines have been seen to work since 1798. It isnt a new idea, its not a radical practice. The pushback we are seeing in 2021 is antiquated and in all honesty disheartening for a lot of people who are taking care of loved ones out there</p>

        <p>No, immunocompromised people are not the responsibility of the rest of society.</p>
<p>They never have been and they never will be.</p>
<p>Animals will eat or abandon their young if they are defective.  I'm not saying we should eat our young, but I'm not going to get an unproven vaccine just because there are a few people on the planet without a working immune system.</p>
<p>Is that too complicated for you?  Is there a way I can simplify that for you?  </p>
<p>No one but me is going to be responsible for me.  That's just how it is.  I am responsible for me.  That's human nature. </p>
<p>And no- the vaccine does NOT protect against future mutations so that entire argument for the vaccine is moot.   And it's been said over and over by multiple doctors that the vaccine WILL NOT GRANT IMMUNITY to the virus.  They have come out again and again and stated that you can still catch and spread the virus even with the vaccine.  Stop ignoring those reports.</p>
<p>Vaccines have been proven to work since 1798.... I'm sorry- the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine is brand new and the first of its kind to be mass distributed because the FDA has refused to approve them because they have not passed trials.   This one was only authorized under the EUA which means that if the president ever lifted the state of emergency, the vaccine you love so much would be ILLEGAL to give to people.</p>
<p>Didn't know that, did you?  The vaccine would be illegal to take outside of an emergency because it hasn't been proven to be safe.</p>
<p>Or maybe you did know that and you were simply hoping that I didn't.</p>

<p>Nice to see your compliance, getting vaccinated for a disease you already had. </p>

        <p>Afaik the official advice is that having had it only gets you immunity for like 6 months and even less for less serious cases, right? If you believe the official stance it seems perfectly reasonable to get the vaccine even after having been sick. If even just to not take a few more days if work later.</p>

        <p>Haha did you just cite an article written DURING the original phase trials last year? Like youre not even proving your point…</p>
<p>The trials were trying to see if they could limit the development of symptoms, yes, but guess what, half of america is vaccinated and suddenly we are seeing infection rates, transmission rates (especially of ppl that actually got vaccinated), and most importantly death rates dropping like sacks of potatoes in the sky. This can be seen in literally every country in the world that was lucky enough to receive sufficient vaccines (and smart enough to actually make a real distribution plan with an appropriate follow through). </p>
<p>If there was some sort of conspiracy that these vaccines were not legit somebody would have flipped on them and become bajillionaires by now. Why would every nation on the planet, left and right winged, all see the same mass infections and deaths at the same time, and then see sharp declines as soon as their populations started getting vaccinated?</p>

        <p>Nobody can prove "0 long term safety data" because this is a universal negative proposition. But it can be disproven with a single long term safety study. So, let's see that long term safety study ...</p>

        <p>We already have done this though? We have people that have been vaccinated for nearly 15 months now without side effects, and confirmed immunity lasts for at least 9 months so far earlier this year.</p>
<p>The shot is like 100 microliters, so like a raindrops volume. Its not like it stays in your body for more than a couple days before just peeing it out. You think something would happen to you in like 30 years by growing hair on your eyes or something? </p>
<p>By the way guess what also doesnt have a long term safety study? Covid19!! We know that the virus was seen to infect the lungs primarily, which causes the more quick deaths. But did you know it was seen to infect multiple organ systems to varying degrees? The heart and brains of patients can also be affected by the infection. This could lead to serious effects in the future for these patients once they reach later stages in life in the next decades: heart attack, Alzheimer’s, could they happen at more frequent rates for those that got covid? Who knows? We wont know for at least a decade or two, but they definitely are more likely than some sort of conspiracy vaccine reaction that just doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>So really, if given the option of taking a preventative for an infection or possibly getting an infection we have never seen that may have long lasting effects on your health, why take that chance at all unless you are just a fool?</p>

        <p>Long term safety data is impossible because it hasn't existed for a sufficiently long period of time. So this is true, unless you are going to dispute the nature of causality and the flow of time. Which is actually a conversation I'm more into than "vaccines are tested bro."</p>
<p>The next two bullet points are taken from the trials directly. He is simply regurgitating pharma's own justifications for the vaccines  because they are insufficient. If you don't believe the pharma companies'own words, why do you want the vaccine?</p>
<p>The last two are public record. Court documents can be searched usually at the website of the Office of Prothonotary for the relevant court. CDC funding isn't secret. If you dispute these, feel free to take your concerns to Blueanon, where you can explain why you think pharma would fabricate records, the government would comply, and they would do so against their own self interest.</p>
