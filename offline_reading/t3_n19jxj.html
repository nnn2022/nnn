    <strong>Covid is contagious, being fat isn't!!!</strong>
    <p><p>But being fat, as well as other unhealthy behaviors like drinking or staying sedentary, can be socially influenced. </p>
<p>And what's worse, you can influence people to be unhealthy while being social distant. </p>
<p>Which is healthier?
- The group of friends who tossed a frisbee in the park or went for a hike every weekend (not distancing) or the group of friends who hung out on zoom with 2 bottles of wine each every weekend (distancing)
- The gym that completely shut down and when they started to open, made it really obnoxious for their clients to workout, or the gym that stayed open and even helped out clients who wanted to get healthier or had trouble affording it because they lost their job
-The group of gamers that gathers together to play and orders one pizza to share, or the group of gamers that stayed in their own homes and ordered their own pizza that they ate all by themselves</p>
<p>If you have fat friends or family, you might have a tendency to eat more. If your friends are all alcoholics, you probably have a drinking problem as well. Sure it's not "contagious" in the classic sense, but the people around you influence you more than you might think.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, being fat is a social contagion.  If you are fat you are more likely to make your friends fat over time, and you and your fat friends with spiral down into mega fat.  They did a study on it recently.</p>

        <p>Make sense. As the saying goes, "you are who you hang around."</p>
<p>I drink once or twice a week but then also walk several miles and lift weights during the week. All things in moderation, exercise included.</p>
