    <strong>I think the CDC will finally give us a "date to lift all restrictions" but not because they want to</strong>
    <p><p>They are liking the control now but down the road especially with what has happened with the J&amp;J. Since their goal seems to be vaccinating almost everyone I am sure they will get desperate. There will come a time where they "need" folks who won't get the vaccine claiming at that time we "haven't reached herd immunity to go back to normal".  </p>
<p>People will bitch and complain because a lot of folks at that time will be vaccinated. They will claim it's unfair that things haven't yet AND THEN BLAME US FOR IT. The most recent argument brought to Fauci was "When do we get our liberty back?" By back I am sure he means for us to be able to live life the way we want to. I am certain they will give us a date in order to "tempt us" to get the vaccine. They will say something like "IF YOU WANT LIFE TO GET BACK TO NORMAL BY JULY 4TH GET VACCINATED" or something like that.  </p>
<p>So we will get our lives back. It's only a matter of time before the CDC makes a last ditch effort and finally give us a date so that even more people will be convinced to get the shot.</p></p>

        <p>The Depopulation shot is what I am calling it. It's not a vaccine. It does nothing to stop CoVid. There are even some doctors now saying that it does NOT diminish symptoms for ANYONE.</p>
<p>Sorry: Never getting this gene therapy ever.</p>

        <p>I doubt that, honestly. I just don't buy the corpos deciding to make less money to advance an ideology. Living, scared patients generate more revenue than all the people who would have bought your product being dead and everyone else not trusting you. </p>
<p>I think everything was just rushed out to get a piece of the panic money, and predictably had massive side effects. That would explain why J&amp;J and AZ got pulled, whereas if their goal actually was depopulation, it would have been all the others that got pulled.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s ironic to me how Fauci and the rest of the government and MSM goons keep using July 4th as a carrot on a string to try and push the vaccine and the idea of getting our liberty back.</p>

<p>I agree, they will give us a end date soon.  I don't understand how the CDC will ever get their respect back though. The director comes across as a hysterical doomer and the previous CDC director appeared homeless.</p>
