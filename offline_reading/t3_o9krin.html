<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Aspergillosis is thought to have gone undetected in India and possibly caused tens of thousands of deaths according to Professor David Denning, Chief Executive of the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections</p>
<h1>Yes, the ExPeRt is absolutely right because NO-ONE would have noticed their body decomposing and turning black/green whilst they were still alive.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;A green fungus that has been detected in a rising number of Covid sufferers could triple the risk of death in some high-risk patients, experts have said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The first case of Aspergillosis was recorded in India last week in a man recovering from a Covid infection who subsequently had to be airlifted into hospital.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;After fighting off the bug the 34-year-old began suffering nosebleeds and a high fever and was diagnosed with the second illness.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus, a common mould that can be found both indoors and out.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Most people can inhale Aspergillus spores without becoming unwell but it can cause health problems like allergic reactions, lung infections and infections in other organs.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Scientists at the Woon Chong of Albany Medical Center (WCAMC) in New York State have now discovered that the condition has occurred in 13.5 percent of patients hospitalised with Covid.</p></p>
