    <strong>List of the most delusional tenets of the covidian faith</strong>
    <p><p>There are many silly, incoherent things that the sheep believe.  Let's start a nice list of them, including quotes and links where possible to create a real resource as the truth slowly trickles out.  I get to go first so I'm taking a really easy one.</p>
<ol>
<li>There were and are so many cases of covid because so many people weren't wearing masks and social distancing.</li>
<li>There were zero cases of flu recorded by the CDC once covid was declared a pandemic.</li>
<li>That's because everyone was wearing masks and social distancing!</li>
</ol></p>

        <p>The notion that the unvaccinated are the reason we can’t get back to normal. This belief persists despite the fact that:</p>
<p>1) the countries with the highest vaccination rates in the world are seeing surges in cases and hospitalizations</p>
<p>2) Iceland’s chief epidemiologist just conceded that herd immunity cannot be achieved via vaccination</p>
<p>3) the head of the CDC proclaimed that the vaccines are no longer capable of preventing transmission</p>
<p>Yet the Covidians still insist—in complete contradiction with the sources that they themselves rely on—that the unvaccinated are at fault.</p>

        <p>1.If we all work together we can end this- we can STOP the spread!
2. A healthy person could just as easily die of COVID as a morbidly obese one. Everyone should be scared and never talk about living healthier lifestyles. That's just fat shaming. 
3. Get vaccinated(mRNA gene therapy)to protect those who can't protect themselves even though mRNA gene therapy doesn't work that way. 
4. Healthy kids should wear masks for years because they can't receive the experimental jab yet. Kids have a .0067% chance of death from COVID, yet should donate their bodies to a science experiment in order to attend school.</p>

        <p>Let's not forget the most delusionally dangerous one of all and my personal most hated: The government, their little corporate bitches, and the elite puppet masters behind both care about you and only want what's best for you in spite of decades, if not centuries of evidence to the contrary.</p>
