    <strong>The comedic nature behind being called a "Science Denier".</strong>
    <p><p>The very nature of science seems to be constant questioning. The same thing with climate change, whether or not you believe it to be man made or long cyclical patterns of our earth, you'll often hear the term "And the SCIENCE IS SETTLED".  </p>
<p>Is the science really ever settled on anything? I just can't think of anything that could possibly more antithetical to real science than what we are seeing today. This blind acceptance and intake of information that is endlessly contradicting itself for the purpose of a political narrative.</p></p>

        <p>There was a video of some African attempt at a science class where the students started shitting on the teacher for not accepting shamanistic magic as the greater reality.  Therefore, science is racist because it does not give equal footing to the magical beliefs of tribal communities.  It's viewed as a white construct now, along with math, even though math was a very multi-cultural discovery.</p>

        <p>&rt;There was a video of some African attempt at a science class where the students started shitting on the teacher for not accepting shamanistic magic as the greater reality.</p>
<p>This is a very specific case of one teacher disrespecting the beliefs of others. I think this is tangentially related to science. The teacher believed that shamanistic magic did not exist, and used whatever resources he/she had in an attempt to deny the belief of the African students.</p>
<p>&rt;It's viewed as a white construct now, along with math, even though math was a very multi-cultural discovery.</p>
<p>As an Asian student who has spent most of her life studying in Asia, I have not ever thought of science or math as tied to a specific race.</p>
<p>If science were viewed as a white construct, I do not think this is relevant to science being racist. Although the humans conducting science may be filled with misogyny and racism, the scientific process is objective.</p>

        <p>Ask any of these morons who scream "science denier!" if they can explain what the scientific method is without googling it. Watch them have a meltdown as they either realize they have no idea what they are talking about or have to admit their conclusions are not based in science whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Questioning everything means getting out of your circlejerk subreddit from time to time and actually looking into all sides of an argument, but I assume this is too complicated for you. Yes, science is never settled, but most people in this sub just want to sit in their antivax echochamber and have their opinion validated.</p>

        <p>You're probably too dimwitted to have noticed but every other subreddit and basically all mainstream media outlets are pro-vax echo chambers so I think most of us are pretty well exposed to that point of view.</p>

        <p>The difference between me and a science denier is that, with good evidence, I would change my mind. Meanwhile you could get all the information and evidence in the world, and you would just deny it because you think the entire world is lying to you. Did the fact this opinion is held by so little people never rise any red flag for you?</p>
<p>If your evidence is that good, if your arguments are well researched, then wouldnt they stand true outside of this community? Why dont you go debate with some medical professionals, or educated people? I have looked into the "evidence" that the people in here provide. Screenshots with no links. Links to papers or articles that are either outdated, debunked, or made in bad faith. Anecdotal evidence.</p>

        <p>Oh sure you looked at the "evidence." Talk about bad faith arguments. Go put on a fresh mask and get yourself a nice experimental jab and that should make you nice and content so you won't have to bother us with your bullshit.</p>

        <p>Once you start seeing all the people on the outside as enemies, you will never engage with their sources in good faith. I am sorry, but I dont think there is much hope for you. At least take your own advice; question everything, including the thing you find here. Dont take things for granted just because they align with your preexisting worldview.</p>

        <p>I don’t see them as enemies. I don’t advocate for their sub Reddit‘s to be banned, wish death on them because they don’t have the same beliefs as me, nor do I try to restrict travel for them because they don’t believe in the same medication that I take.  I also don’t harass them or chase them out of stores because they’re not as fearful as myself. </p>
<p>Honestly, I think I’ve been quite tolerant considering the circumstances.</p>

        <p>Restricting travel and entrance into shops is a matter of safety for the workers in those shops. Your freedom ends when the safety of others starts. Noone wishes for anyones death, or at least I do not wish for that. </p>
<p>When I say you see people as enemies, I mean that you dont engage in good faith with the sources that they provide. Most people would agree that lockdown puts a lot of strain on peoples mental health and that it affects small bussinesses. Most people would agree that the goverment is not handling this well. But when you start linking "data" about the vaccines being more dangerous then the virus itself, or theories about the virus being a hoax, you have to be open to being contradicted.</p>
