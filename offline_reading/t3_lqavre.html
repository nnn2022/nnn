    <strong>2003 SARS Vaccine???</strong>
    <p><p>I'm kinda young so 2003 SARS was before my time. But I've had multiple people tell me that the vaccine that they made for that virus increased the likelihood you'd die from it. (Although the vaccine was never mas distributed because the virus went away). Keep in mind that 2003 SARS shares like 70% of its DNA with COVID.</p>
<p>I can't find any articles on this. I'm assuming that they were taken down so people couldn't bring this up.</p>
<p>Can you guys please confirm if this vaccine did actually kill people and what happened with it. Thanks</p></p>

        <p>Wish I screen captured it but I remember back in April I easily found a document from the CDC saying basically that the attempted SARS vaccine killed alot of the subjects and failed animal testing.</p>
<p>Tried to find it a few months ago and it was gone. I think it was from 2007...</p>

        <p>The vaccine they were working on at that time was never tested on humans because when the animals they tested it on were exposed to the actual virus, the died due to a cytokine storm.  This is why a vaccine for SARS never emerged.</p>

        <p>Use duckduckgo to research ADE (antibody dependent enhancement). They don't even know yet if Covid can cause that. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/potential-for-antibodydependent-enhancement-of-sarscov2-infection-translational-implications-for-vaccine-development/504FE38E2475590EFE93872BC6D67D3D">Here</a> is a source. While looking for you I found out that some ferrets injected with the 2003 vaccine developed liver problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/antibody-dependent-enhancement-and-vaccines">Here</a> is another good one. They don't mention SARS for whatever reason.</p>
