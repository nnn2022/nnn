    <strong>What is your response to "You are not at risk but you could be spreading it to others, who then spread it to granny at home"?</strong>
    <p><p>This is the ultimate Karen sledgehammer at this point, as most arguments are just dusted this far into the debate. I keep getting virtue signal trolled like this and they always end up with something along the lines of "oh, so you do not care".  My logical response, but of course they do not care, is that even if you do spread it to old people, the IFR is still pretty low and the treatment is just getting better. Also, there is still weak evidence for the asymptomatic spread and people who are symptomatic would be paranoid enough to isolate in this climate.</p></p>

        <p>I tell them to fuck right off. Individuals are responsible and can control only their own actions. Those people that complain, honestly should live in a bubble themselves and collect the government welfare for life and never come into contact with people again.</p>

<p>Actually, nope, not at all. I truly and honestly do not give a shit. I have my own shit to worry about than to start thinking about the health of some random hack's grandparents whom I've never even met. Now I'm not gonna go out and just purposefully try to infect senior citizens, but you or your family's health is not my responsibility.</p>
<p>If you're afraid of infecting your loved ones, YOU need to be the one taking precautions. I am not gonna shut my life off so that you or your family can feel safe. Ultimately, if you pass the virus to your grandparents, that's your own goddamn fault.</p>

        <p>I say where the fuck was your mask when my grandma died of flu complications a few years ago? why do they only care about masks when the media tells them too? Then I call them grandma killers and that they never really cared, they just obviously enjoy the time off with pay sitting their fat asses on their moral high ground, judging everyone who dares exist and wants to question the official narratives of the pedophiles at the top who govern over us.</p>

        <p>My granpa died of pneumonia that was probably passed to him from his caretaker that had a bad cold and went to work anyway. It was kind of maddening but he was a 85 very sick man that had a very limited life expectancy and a very low quality life. Yeah this is just another way old people pass to the after life. Nothing crazy</p>

        <p>I always wonder what these grannies and people who live with grannies are doing at restaurants or the beach with me. I'll wear a mask at the grocery store and social distance because vulnerable people have no choice but to go there, but if someone wants to risk their life doing something non-essential like going to the beach why is it my responsibility to protect them?</p>

        <p>This has always been true. Every person who ever had the flu, chicken pox, tuberculosis, etc got it from someone else. Yet no one was held responsible like some kind of murderer unless they knowingly spread something like AIDS, which is way less common than the previously mentioned afflictions.</p>
<p>If we change the standard to "we can never be allowed to spread an illness to anyone" then we will forever be in a lockdown.</p>
<p>And if anyone asks me, no I do not care if I spread something to a stranger. I do care about my father and would take precautions around him, but everyone else is not my responsibility.</p>

        <p>I would tell them its more likely a vulnerable person is able to transmit than its the other way around. What they are doing is virtue signaling at its worst. Aren't most of them going to turn around and tell you to die in a fire if you disagree with them, meaning it was never about saving lives?</p>
<p>Also, even nursing home patients are saying they'd rather die rather than being totally isolated from society and their families.</p>

<p>Because I don't care. I mean obviously I'd like to not get people sick but if I'm not sick then I can't do that. If I'm not showing symptoms of illness I'm not going to assumed I'm a walking Grandma Killer Machine. I'm not fucking doing it because it's illogical.</p>

        <p>I don't spend time with elderly or immunocompromised people. During my weekly outing to the grocery store everyone wears masks and I don't stop and talk to people. Briefly passing someone isn't likely to transmit the virus. And if someone is super worried they can stay home and have groceries delivered or have someone else shop for them.</p>
<p>We can't live worrying about some long chain of infections that might eventually kill someone. We've all been part of such a chain in the past, as colds and flus have always killed vulnerable people. This is no different.</p>

        <p>&rt; the fact that you are putting your elderly and weaker family at risk with this mindset. </p>
<p>I guess we’re assuming everyone lives with everyone they care about, and therefore the elderly and weaker family is a victim of your actions with no control themselves - they can’t simply <em>not see you.</em> </p>
<p>But the real point: what’s the actual risk? </p>
<p>There’s risk inherent in being alive. There’s risk in running down the stairs, driving a car, etc. It is never sufficient to say “there’s a risk” because there is always a risk. The real question is “does the risk warrant any action to mitigate it?” </p>
<p>You want to argue that the answer is yes, I expect an evidence based estimate of how big the risk is ... because, of course, if the risk is 0.0000000000000001%, then I think most humans would agree it doesn’t matter. So what’s your estimate? </p>
<p>The risk here needs to account for: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the likelihood of your actually being infected at a given time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the likelihood of your being asymptomatic or presymptomatic (I’m assuming decent people will stay  home/isolated when symptomatic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the likelihood of your actually transmitting it, while asymptomatic/presymptomatic, to someone who is elderly or weak </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the likelihood of that person getting infected from you and in fact having severe or otherwise dangerous symptoms (because if they handle it with no problem, then it doesn’t matter whether they get it) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s the actual risk? How big is it?</p>

        <p>Yo I'm using my porn account bc I got banned, that's what I get for using a source. There is a fucking risk, that's why 15 percent of cases were from asymptomatic people. Last time I checked people don't like dying from a global pandemic, one million people have died from this virus wdym what's the actual risk</p>
<p>With the attitude of 'lol it's like no one who died why should I care' is the exact attitude that kills people, look at america, 200k people are dead, last time I checked that's more than 3 people</p>
<p>Australia had 700 cases per day and immediately went into lockdown, today we have 7 cases. Ignoring it won't go away</p>
<p>Edit: got the case numbers wrong lol</p>

        <p>200k in America out of it's population of 330 million plus is 0.6% of the population. Sure by itself 200k is most definitely a lot but percentage wise it is tiny. No one on this sub is ignoring anything because well, this sub is entirely devoted to covid and our opposition to restrictive mandates. Now less than 7k have been people 44 yrs or younger out of that 200k.</p>
<p>Edit: 85% of deaths had 2.3 underlying conditions meaning they were going to die of one thing or another, covid included. What is amazing is people believing they can put off death. Death comes when it comes as hard as that is to hear, and yes I'm speaking from experience. I won't drive myself insane thinking I could protect someone by convincing someone else to do what I was told.</p>
<p>Btw your lockdown will continue indefinitely. No government gives up this kind of power. Before you point to New Zealand I would like to see what sends them into a panic to demand harsher measures. You probably don't care, I imagine you have one of those black dystopian banners with the phrase "I Stand With Dan" over your porch....</p>

        <p>You really can't say lockdown will be indefinite. If in a few months or a year when cases have nosedived and we are still in a lockdown then you will have a point, until then it is nothing more than a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>Even in australia where it is the most critical lockdown has a roadmap. There is talk on Sunday the premier is going to announce ease of restrictions, mostly because the opposition is banging on about it. It is nothing more than a thinly veiled smear campaign however. Look up how much a monopoly the murdock press has on australia, it's pretty fucked</p>
<p>Why do all you people not like the elderly? If I shot you in the back of the head right now you would probably like to complain, saying that it's only shortening peoples lifespan is not exactly the most moral thing to say, I thought we would try to help our fellow man, live a healthy and happy life and not have it cut short by a deadly virus because someone doesn't want to stay indoors, I'm not sure how long my father has. If he were to die early by this virus I would only further disagree with you, these are people after all</p>
<p>Don't assume an identity of me btw, it's really dumb to believe that people like me are the enemy when really I'm just trying to figure out what going on as much as you are. Appreciate the lengthy response thou</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? Cases have already nosed dive. You went from 700 cases to 12 and you don't consider that a drastic reduction? Either you're not aware of statistics or you are being willfully ignorant. Also if you were to shoot me in the back of the head I don't think I would be able to do much complaining. Kinda sick you'd think that is legitimate comparison but whatever. </p>
<p>Where in my post did I say I do not like the elderly? Lets take into consideration the suicides that have increased because of the lockdowns. For every elderly person that was "saved" who's life we may have extended say 5 to 10 years comes at the cost of 3 young people who kill themselves.</p>
<p>Is the cost worth it to you? Is it beneficial to society? Who knows what these people would have accomplished. What we do know is most of the people who we're trying to protect are more than likely in nursing homes. Their life is over for the most part, those lost to suicide had their whole lives ahead of them. Now it's gone with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Have you considered the elderly who's child committed suicide over this? Do you think they like the fact that they out lived their child all because an unnecessary lockdown and the fact that it was all done in their name? That would be a torturous mind fuck for me being a parent myself. Also claiming you care about the elderly while isolating them from friends and family sounds more inhumane than letting them see their loved ones and taking their chance with the virus.</p>

        <p>Oh great! I'm glad that since suicides didn't happen in Victoria on the scale they're happening here, that their lives are irrelevant . I guess for me that calls to question your earlier statement:</p>
<p>"  <em>saying that it's only shortening peoples lifespan is not exactly the most moral thing to say, I thought we would try to help our fellow man, live a healthy and happy life and not have it cut short by a deadly virus because someone doesn't want to stay indoors"</em></p>
<p>So preventing a covid infection is moral but preventing suicide isn't? We only help those at risk of infection because they're considered our "fellow man" but people prone to suicide aren't considered the same? Or people who are at risk of dying from <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/research/coronavirus-hunger-research">starvation</a>? A life cut short by suicide isn't as tragic as one who's cut short by Covid? Interesting you call bullshit when <a href="https://chapterland.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/11/US_FactsFigures_Flyer.pdf">suicide</a> in the States is ranked higher than death by covid but whatever. Remember, to you no death is more important than a covid death....</p>

        <p>Has death increase directly because of suicide? That's the million dollar question, I feel like starvation is a consequence of governments not giving enough support to people in need than lockdown, in australia we get a decent sum of money every week however in america you got like 1200 and that was it</p>

        <p>Well considering that at this moment you have to do extensive research just to get the overall death count in America, which in pre covid era was one google search and click away from that tally, is pretty telling in of itself. I didn't even get my 1200 dollar check, salary was cut in half and now my family is one paycheck away from oblivion. The million dollar question is are you yourself contributing to the secondary effects of lockdowns by supporting them? For someone like me who is watching in real time these mega corporations receiving their bailout within hours of legislation and use that money to install invasive technology in combination with government institutions is sobering to say the least. Especially being aware of this years in advance and seeing them use covid as an excuse to implement it. You're not trying to figure it out like me. There is nothing to figure out. You guys are the beta test for what they want to do to us all. Our media never says shit about Australia because you are allies and the general population would be horrified at the measures you have taken. It's sad that even you admit your governments response has been "brutal" (your words not mine) yet you still support it....that is insane. Luckily we weren't stupid enough to give up our guns, but if they ever pull some shit over here in my home state of Texas best believe I'm taking a couple of those thugs out. Real talk.</p>

        <p>Maybe the media doesn't want to say anything about australia because people will get ideas about what actually works. The difference between my country and yours is that we have 6 cases in my state today while you would have it in the hundreds at least. You can talk about the secondary implications all you want, but I'll sleep soundly knowing that today in Victoria no one died of the varus</p>
<p>Secondary implications are thing if you can prove them, can you provide evidence? I won't take you seriously if you are talking out your ass</p>

        <p>Dude, that's more reflective of your broken american system than anything else tbh, if you doubled the suicide rates and starvation you still won't come close to the 220 thousand people. Keep in mind your lockdown has reported to have <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/us/coronavirus-distancing-deaths.amp.html">saved alot of lives anyway.</a> Everything has a push and pull remember, and as it turns out I can do basic math and one google search</p>
<p>Get destroyed libtard imagine not being supported by your government while billionaires only get richer. No wonder suicides and starvation is so high in America, you only got 1200 to live off of damn</p>

        <p>Quote where I specifically implied I don't like old people. What I said was the majority of deaths came from people who had MULTIPLE ILLNESSES. Dying at 60 or older isn't an early death.  They also lived fuller lives as opposed to someone dying in their 20's from starvation or suicide. What we do know from the data available is people below the age of 60 are at extremely low risk so all these precautions are of no need.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why do all you people not like the elderly? </p>
<h1>FUCK YOU.</h1>
<p>You are not acting out of love or care for the elderly. </p>
<p>If you were, you’d give a damn that they are being tortured with indefinite isolation. I’m not exaggerating: prolonged enforced isolation is a globally recognized method of <strong>torture.</strong> The impact of such isolation on the victim is not dependent in any way whatsoever on anyone’s motivation or good intentions: a person forced into indefinite isolation is being tortured. </p>
<p>If you cared <em>at all</em> about the elderly, you’d treat them as humans who deserve respect and control over their own decisions and lives. You’d fucking LISTEN when they tell you they’re miserable and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nextavenue.org/families-unite-to-open-up-nursing-homes/amp/">don’t want to be isolated.</a></p>
<p>If you cared AT ALL about the elderly, you’d fucking care about the fact that isolation <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nextavenue.org/families-unite-to-open-up-nursing-homes/amp/">is a severe health threat that can independently kill them just as effectively as covid can.</a> </p>
<p>If you cared AT ALL about the elderly, you’d care about the 30,000 excess deaths amongst Alzheimer’s and dementia patients this year in the US alone. </p>
<p>Congratulations! You saved them from covid by literally torturing them to death! If you were an evil villain and your <em>only</em> goal were to slowly torture the elderly to death, you couldn’t pick a better fucking plan than indefinite social isolation. Good job, killer! </p>
<p>&rt; it’s really dumb to believe that people like me are the enemy when I’m really just trying to figure out what’s going on as much as you are. </p>
<p>You will rarely find <em>anyone</em> as open to discussion with opposing viewpoints as I am. If you’d like to confirm that, feel free to scroll through my comments - you’ll see that I <strong>often</strong> attempt to have friendly, substantive discussions with people who hold different views. You’ll also see that I openly advocate for people in these subs to <em>welcome</em> those with opposing views, provided they are civil and sincere - and call them out when they don’t. </p>
<p>But you are NOT here to “figure out” stuff. You’re here to accuse people of hating Grandma, because that’s exactly what you did. </p>
<p>So let’s play that game!</p>
<h3>Why do you hate children so much that you want to cut their life earning AND life spans short by depriving them of education?</h3>
<h3>Why do you hate black people so much that you want to literally starve them to death?</h3>
<h3>Why do you want little girls in Africa to be ripped out of schools, forced into marriages, and genitally mutilated? Does it get you off?</h3>
<h3>Why do you want victims of domestic abuse to be locked at home with their abusers 24/7?</h3>
<h3>Why do you want people to needlessly die of cancer that they would have survived if they’d been diagnosed and treated properly?</h3>
<p>I could go on but I trust you understand the point. </p>
<p>Don’t bother answering, I know the answer: you don’t want any of those things, you simply <strong>don’t fucking care about them</strong> at all. </p>
<p>You care about your fear, and you care - or don’t care - about everything else depending exclusively on whether it makes you feel less afraid. You don’t give the tiniest fuck about the elderly; to the contrary, you’ll happily sacrifice their well-being and their lives just to make you feel safer. </p>
<p>As someone who cares very deeply about the elderly, FUCK YOU.</p>

        <p>Well that's the thing about this varus, it is very counter intuitive. On one hand you need support for children and elderly for their various needs, however that comes at a cost of risking infection and death, that's why no one likes this year. The only thing anyone can do is a brutal lockdown that sucks, but rids the varus quicker than any other method </p>
<p>No one said it was the most fun option, situations where people die usually require a little sacrifice. It's  never the most optimally moral but there is no other option really. And no matter how much you use caps lock, the varus won't go away, something something 1mil people</p>

        <p>Exactly: you just don’t care about it. </p>
<p>You care about the virus solely because you personally fear it. Everything else? Necessary, someone else’s problem, literally any excuse possible to avoid even thinking about it. </p>
<p>But you say we want to save lives!</p>
<p>Where’s your concern for the very strong likelihood that our lockdowns are estimated to cause MANY more deaths than Covid will? Do 8-12 million deaths from starvation not count to you because they’re mostly deaths of black people? </p>
<p>If you honestly cared about anything other than yourself, you’d spend time and effort fully understanding all the costs - and deaths - that we are choosing with lockdowns. </p>
<p>If you honestly cared at all about saving lives, then you’d put in the effort to make sure <em>that lockdowns are, in aggregate, saving more lives than they cost.</em></p>
<p>But you don’t care about anything other than yourself, so you don’t bother to do these things - why would you? You’re the only one who matters! </p>
<p>You are selfish to the point of intentional cruelty, and you’re proud of yourself for it. Shameful.</p>

        <p>I mean I don't exactly fear it, there is a fine line between bravery and stupidity and I'm trying not to cross it. You know it literally said that it was the only option that would mean less rona and therefore the better option. Can you prove that lockdown is costing more lives?</p>

        <p>&rt; There is a fucking risk</p>
<p>Pretty sure I openly stated that there is a risk. Why are you arguing against an imaginary statement? That’s silly. </p>
<p>I want to know the size of that risk, which is necessary to make informed decisions on how to handle it. I assume, if you advocate for lockdowns, you have a strong estimate of the size of that risk - note here that I’m assuming that you are an intelligent person who makes informed decisions. By the way, there’s not a scientist on the planet who would disagree that understanding the size of a risk - beyond just noting that “there is a risk” - is absolutely necessary in order to determine how to address it. </p>
<p>But your response seems like a verbose way of saying, “I have no clue what the risk is beyond the fact that it exists.”</p>

        <p>Whoops must of missed that my bad, I feel like you are sticking to this for no reason. You keep saying that the risk is undetermined of <em>checks notes</em> asymptomatic people transmitting the varus to family who is at danger. I mean correct me if I am wrong but if that is the point you are making, than that is way too specific to be a gotcha moment like you think it is</p>
<p>Really the take away from that study was that you need to be weary when interacting with your family. The specific number how much you should be worried is a reflection on the varus' unpredictability, what it didn't say is that since the risk is undetermined and is varied depending on who you ask, (which is thing that happens when a study is in its infancy) that there is no worry at all and it's fine</p>

        <p>I have never, ever suggested that anyone should NOT be cautious when around vulnerable people - to the contrary, I strongly advocate caution. </p>
<p>And I have no intention of getting anyone sick. My partner had a mild fever for literally just a few hours, and woke up the next day feeling great. Nonetheless, we both went to get tested and I have cancelled all my appointments for the week pending the test results - not a huge deal, but still an expensive and inconvenient response. I took it precisely because I’m not interested in getting anyone sick and am willing to take reasonable steps to prevent it. </p>
<p>My point is that the risk of an asymptomatic person without a mask actually being infected, infecting a random person during the course of the day, and then that person infecting another vulnerable person who develops severe symptoms (the hypothetical of OP) is just ludicrously low - you’re in “getting struck by lightning” or “winning the lottery” territory. </p>
<p>When you’re dealing with such outrageously low risks, risk management is properly left to the individual - including the person who lives with grandma, and grandma herself.</p>

        <p>I mean sure however you say that the risk is lower but by how much lower is it? As studies come in we will find out, but currently it's a schrodinger's cat of how bad it could be, make a proper judgement when it's clear, but for now just keep that in mind</p>
<p>If you are feeling ok from this varus then more power to you, just don't do anything completely stupid then I really do not see a reason to complain</p>

<p>Exactly. </p>
<p><strong>You</strong> are the one supporting a massive deviation from normal life and individual freedoms. <strong>You</strong> should know the answer that question before you tell other people how to live. </p>
<p>But you don’t because this isn’t about other people or saving lives - it’s purely about making <em>you</em> feel safe, and therefore you don’t see any need to think beyond your selfish feelings.</p>

        <p>A massive deviation is this year's motto, the key is adapting to the situation and looking at the facts, and the fact that it is not clear is bad, because that means we don't really don't understand the varus as much as we would want to. Just because a few experts are saying different things doesn't mean there is literally no reason for concen and we are all fine, despite how specific this really is and it makes the minority of cases</p>

        <p>Oh god another doomer who doesn't understand context. From your source above:</p>
<p><em>'I used the phrase “very rare” and I think that it’s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare …</em> <strong><em>we don’t actually have that answer yet</em></strong><em>,’ she said.</em></p>
<p><em>‘I wasn’t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that … what I was referring to was a subset of studies. These are</em> <strong><em>estimates</em></strong>*, and there’s a* <strong><em>big range</em></strong> <em>from the different</em> <strong><em>models</em></strong>*.*</p>
<p>Getting estimates from models and NOT real world data means absolutely NOTHING. We need real unmolested data without the interference of political agendas. From the article:</p>
<p><em>‘Some</em> <strong><em>estimates</em></strong> <em>of around 40% of transmission</em> <strong><em>may</em></strong> <em>be due to asymptomatic, but those are from</em> <strong><em>models</em></strong> <em>and so I didn’t include that in my answer yesterday.'</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.10.20097543v2"><em>A recent review</em></a> <em>analysing data from nine international studies, led by Australian general practice researcher Professor Paul Glasziou,</em> <strong><em>suggests</em></strong> <em>asymptomatic coronavirus cases account for</em> <strong><em>around</em></strong> <strong><em>15%</em></strong> <em>of COVID-19 infection, but that these people spread the disease at a ‘considerably lower rate’.</em></p>
<p>It would be nice to get a definitive answer instead of these general estimates. What pisses me off is the fact they can claim "asymptomatic coronavirus cases account for <strong><em>around</em></strong> <strong>15%"</strong> but state initially "we don’t actually have that answer yet..."</p>
<p>Jesus Christ doomers carefully read these things before posting this as "evidence".</p>

        <p>You know considerably less does not mean absolutely zero right? Even if asymptomatic people never transmit cases it still would not be a risk worth taking. Because there is also the likely risk that you could actually be affected by it</p>
<p>I really don't get the point you are making, at the end of the day asymptomatic people are a minority. You can claim the best case scenario all you want but it won't change much since being affect by rona is still very likely</p>
