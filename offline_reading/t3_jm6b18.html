    <strong>I'm so frustrated that it was immediately taboo to talk about the human cost of lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so frustrated that it is taboo to talk about the human cost of lockdown. Not only is it frowned upon, it is actually forbidden in many places. <em>This post has been deleted... community guidelines.</em></p>
<p>Very early on, any politician who opposed lockdown was instantly labeled a fascist, or greedy, or just plain evil. Instead of a rational discussion we immediately had a false dichotomy shoved down our throats: <em>either you love lockdown or you hate the elderly.</em></p>
<p>When a threat arises I want to see smart, logical, level headed people discussing and arguing over what to do. I want to see roundtable discussions on the news. I want to read about different countries trying different strategies (go Sweden!). I want to hear philosophers and ethics professors having debates about what quality of life means, and how we ought to balance safety with freedom.</p>
<p>But no. We instantly landed on Groupthink-False-Dichotomy<em>. This is the only answer, you are either with us or against us.</em></p></p>

        <p>&rt;either you love lockdown or you hate the elderly.</p>
<p>It's even worse than that. There never was any room for discussion. Not giving a shit about the elderly makes you an asshole but it's a legitimate point of view. It's a kind of decision that's been done countless times in history. Women and children first, don't we say?</p>

        <p>Like triage, trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number. But those decisions need to be weighed and discussed and argued. We need to allow for arguments to happen.</p>
<p>Instead we just get censorship and oversimplified answers. And political games.</p>

        <p>Oversimplified answers really bother me. When people say “grandma killer” or “if you go out, you might be fine catching it, but you could spread it to a more vulnerable person,” I cringe. Like people don’t already know they could spread it if they catch it? That’s literally what the word “contagious” means lol. It’s not profound in any way to bring that up.</p>

<p>They never said it about BLM,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there were never reporters confronting the tens of thousands that gathered at some points (google black trans lives matter nyc) and saying "you could spread it to someone who could die!!!! What would you say to their family!!!"  </p>
<p>But whenever anyone opposes lockdown they say (and I still see it on twitter) " how many people do you want to <em>let die" (Implying lockdowns are infallible and people were immortal before lockdowns)</em>  </p>
<p>It's so exhausting.  </p>
<p>I honestly give up at this point, my country is finished. It's only going to end when the people standing up and screaming for more lockdowns become jobless themselves and we have a collapse of social programs and the government starts to "balance the books"  </p>
<p>Suddenly all the people that were shouting for infinite lockdowns will be silent, but it will be too late.</p>

        <p>Yep, exactly how I feel. I’ve unfollowed my city’s subreddit because any mention of the economic impact of all of this gets me downvoted and insulted. I was literally told that I “don’t care if my grandmother dies.” </p>
<p>There’s no rational discussion, it’s just dogpiling, insults and frothing-at-the-mouth hatred from these morons.</p>
<p>This whole thing is very much perpetuating a “good vs. evil” mentality and people can’t wait to show others just how good they are!!! I saw a thread and people were talking about how they “forced” family members to cancel Halloween parties and shit like that. It was like the COVID-awareness olympics. Disgusting.</p>

        <p>I excused myself from the childfree sub (I've been getting tired of the constant negativity anyway) and there were 2 posts saying if you took your kids trick or treating you were the worst, selfish, you are going to cause your kids to DIE. The other one was screeching about how no one was wearing masks, <em>how shameful</em>.</p>
<p>Ah yes, kids. The lowest risk factor group. You are 100% condemning your children to death if you allow them to go out for a few hours and have some normalcy for the first time in months.</p>
<p>They thrive on the fear and compliance so much that it's becoming a cult.</p>

<p>The sub is also super liberal, so as someone who falls in the middle/right, a lot of the stuff they freak out over, I don't. </p>
<p>A thing I've noticed with my entire left leaning friends is they absolutely thrive on hysteria and fear mongering. </p>
<p>Trump gets elected? Prepare for a Nazi state. Trump is going to start WWIII. Now it's the virus. Honestly the most destruction we've seen are from the riots- which they condone so it doesn't even make sense.</p>

        <p>Exactly!</p>
<p>Especially with how no one cared about the Swine Flu. Someone tried to argue with me that it wasn't considered a pandemic and was only around for a couple of months.</p>
<p>...no. It was declared a pandemic in June of 2009 and ended in August 2010. It was over a year long and the death toll globally was anywhere from 250K-550K. Where was the panic? Shops running out of supplies? The lockdowns? The masks?</p>
<p>I'm only 26 but I've even noticed the trend.</p>

        <p>Dude like I dislike entitled parents and badly behaved kids just as much as the next person, but I don't feel the need to constantly whine about it.</p>
<p>It does get annoying that some older folk tell me I'll change my mind but my boyfriend and family support me so that's good enough for me.</p>
<p>I don't mind the people who are venting about relationships ending because their SO changed their mind, or expressing regret as a parent, or some personal discussion type things. Hell I posted a picture of the shirt my Secret Santa got me that said "Cats Not Kids" because I found it cute. It's the rants and raves that are ridiculous. The raves are often super condescending and off putting. For a group that claims to be so happy because they don't have kids, they're quite a miserable lot.</p>

How many MORE people are going to die of cancer and heart disease because they couldn't get proper screening or treatment for half a year?

        <p>&rt;<em>you hate the elderly</em> </p>
<p>And the worst part is that these pro-lockdowners do not really give a damn the elderly. So many of them with dementia have deteriorated, and many died or loneliness or preventable diseases. They don't care about anything anymore, even when these lockdowns are over. All they care is the domphime hit they get from being a communal narcissist.</p>

        <p>They don’t give a shit about the elderly. If they did, something would be done about the mental health issues that are plaguing the elderly population due to forced isolation. Some of these poor bastards haven’t seen their kids or grandkids since February.</p>

        <p>Yeah, nobody gave a damn about the elderly before now. Everyone knew there were HUGE problems with long term care facilities. The big root cause is chronic understaffing because of a lack of public will to fund them. You would have to take money away from someone else, or just raise taxes. </p>
<p>Anyways suddenly Covid comes and now all the politicians care and now we close down the economy. If funding was a problem before how are we ever going to afford proper healthcare now?</p>

        <p>I'd like to encourage you to consider where ideas of "tinfoil hats" and term "conspiracy theory" come from.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of knowledge in the public domain and it is reasonable to try to piece it together in a way that makes sense.  Yes, it's possible to get things wrong.  In the words of George Box, "all models are wrong, some are useful".  If a "conspiracy theory" not only allows you to make sense of data but also <em>allows you to issue accurate predictions</em>, then it is more useful than not.  </p>
<p>In my time exploring "conspiracy theories" -- some of them quite nutty, some of them quite plausible -- I have found that as I discerned the likely true from the likely false I have been better able to predict the trajectories of national and global events.</p>

        <p>This is the main reason I oppose everything, as well as the bogus science that was used to justify all the wild claims surrounding this virus. Studies that normally take years or decades to properly perform were suddenly available within a month of the virus spreading in Europe. Before any country had a mandatory mask law "studies" were already popping up how masks were effective in stopping the spread of the virus, even though up to that point scientific consensus was that they barely work, only in controlled settings when properly handled and for short periods of time. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1292">One such study</a></p>

        <p>Also the idea that "even one death is too many" is absolutely ridiculous. Imagine if we took that stance with everything. We wouldn't have cars, planes, buildings, roads, pretty much everything has killed something. Hell, bathrooms are the most deadly room in a home. A certain number of deaths will always be required for progress and for life to go on. Were all going to die some day</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing that but also... fuuuck.</p>
<p>From that account: "Lockdown deaths can also be laundered into Covid deaths". That's just great. People are going to be killing themselves at home from desperation and even THAT will count as a Covid death.</p>

        <p>His stuff is so good, but so hard to
Grasp because it is so detailed. Basically he found just how many people are literally not dead from covid—and he meticulously charts it w/ CDC numbers. </p>
<p>I couldn’t believe the lockdown deaths things being counted as covid, either. Ridiculous</p>

        <p>Same. I wish I paid more attention in school. The people applying the data and uncovering truths are out there...their voices are just censored and repressed. That is why it is so important for people like us to try to get the wheels turning in people’s minds. Just a kind, but thought provoking comment or question. It generally falls on deaf ears, but yesterday I shit you not I got 2 doomers to start realizing things aren’t quite what they seem...I even got one to join lockdown skepticism, because they were truly starting to ask the right questions. Slowly but surely...most will see thru this illusion</p>

<p>We can't just say "Fuck you, you're wrong!" and then go back to our own tribes. We need to be talking and arguing and discussing with people who disagree with us. On all issues. </p>
