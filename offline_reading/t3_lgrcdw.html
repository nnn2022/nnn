<p><strong>Opinion</strong></p>
<p>There are some pretty disgusting offences in this list, a lot of them are sexual offences which will cause real, long-term damage to their victims. I want to know how Government ministers think it is "appropriate" to be sending people to prison for the same amount of time as a paedophile, for putting a false name on a bit of paper.</p>
<p>Notice there is no offence here for lying on immigration/customs documents (which is the closest thing I can think of to this offence), since they would <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-301-civil-penalties-for-contraventions-of-customs-law/excise-notice-301-civil-penalties-for-contraventions-of-customs-law">normally be punished via civil proceedings</a> and consist of a range of fines. There is absolutely no reason to be sending people to prison for this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/22/part/2A/crossheading/power-to-make-regulations">The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, Section 45F, Paragraph (5)(a)</a> explicitly states that "Health protection regulations may not create an offence triable on indictment or punishable with imprisonment", yet here we are.</p>
<p>This over-zealous use of the Act has happened before, with the £10000 fines. Paragraph (5A) of the same section of the same Act states "Health protection regulations that create an offence punishable with a fine and a further fine for each day on which the default continues after conviction may not provide for the further fine to exceed an amount equal to 2% of the greater of £5,000 or level 4 on the standard scale."</p>
<p>£5000 + 2% = £5100</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_scale#United_Kingdom">Level 4 of the standard scale = £2500</a></p>
<p>So £5400 is the largest fine able to be issued under regulations introduced under the Act, yet we see fines of £10000 being issued regualrly.</p>
<p>I'd love to know everyone else's opinion on this, what do you think of the 10 year prison sentences etc.?</p></p>

        <p>Somehow I am getting the impression that some governments are doing stuff like this on purpose to piss people off and get themselves into trouble. Maybe they are masochistic  or suicidal or even more insane than I had ever imagined.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I feel like their arguments for lockdown are wearing incredibly thin ("case" numbers are similar where they were at the end of lockdown 2, despite the massive increase in testing since then, 1/4 of the adult population is vaccinated, etc.)</p>
<p>I think they're doing this because the only way they can get people to comply is to have a massive power show, to scare them into compliance. It's kinda like "if you don't obey the domestic restrictions, we _can_ send you to prison for it, even though we're not there yet".</p>
<p>It's all psychological games and it's disgusting, so I absolutely agree with you, they're a bunch of masochists.</p>

        <p>That is true, I was thinking that while I was making the list.</p>
<p>Either way, it's always good to have the comparisons. Both for comparing coronavirus breaches to literal paedophilia, and for comparing other stupid punishments.</p>
<p>It's just so stupid, a man who does(?) incest with a girl under 13 has a lesser maximum sentence than someone who puts a wrong name on a form.</p>
