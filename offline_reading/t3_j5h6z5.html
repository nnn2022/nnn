    <strong>Civil Discussion.</strong>
    <p><p>Hiya, using a throwaway for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I am an individual who has had family members badly effected by COVID-19. I am just asking for a civil discussion about why some people may want to avoid wearing masks for doing quick and mundane tasks, such as going out for groceries, or even wondering why some people are calling everything a hoax.</p>
<p>I hope this won't get deleted, and I hope nobody gets upset at me here.</p>
<p>EDIT: Cheers for the discussion guys! Was interesting to hear from all of you. Stay safe, wash your hands and stay in lockdown if you're told :)</p>
<p>Cya.</p></p>

        <p>Masks don't do anything to stop the spread.</p>
<p>It is heart-breaking and scary that people have SO easily fallen for the propaganda about them and have been SO easily willing to abandon ALL common sense about them. The public health campaign of FEAR has been very successful, sadly.</p>
<p>Research now is questioning the ethics of this public health fear campaign for Covid-19, given the devastation the lockdowns have caused, the low, low mortality of the virus, and the violation of civil liberties.</p>

        <p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>The moronic shutdowns are causing way way more issues than the disease.</p>
<p>People are committing suicide, marriages are falling apart, drug and alcohol use is through the roof.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we are facing massive starvation issues in 3rd world countries because trade is largely discontinued.  </p>
<p>COVID is slightly worse than a bad flu.  Potentially deadly for elderly.</p>
<p>Masks do nothing.  In Canada the cases have actually risen since the masks became mandatory.  We have squandered billions of dollars for NOTHING.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed since March.  We are no further ahead.  Just wasting time and money.  Spreading lies and encouraging laziness.</p>
<p>GET. BACK. TO. WORK.  </p>
<p>Burn your masks and start standing up for yourself and your children.</p>

        <p>Hang on - where IS everyone from this thread..?</p>
<p>Where I am, there's nothing to do with fear, because that would confuse people. It's simply things like "Please wear a mask", or "Wash your hands thoroughly".</p>
<p>Also, "violation of civil liberties"? It's a piece of fabric you wear on your face. It's not that big of a deal - and if you're locked down, it's because there are severly increacing rates of infection around you.</p>
<p>Seriously, this thing is NOT nice. I've seen it first hand. I'd rather people not experience it, man, even if it has "low mortality". It's a quickly spreading global pandemic.</p>

        <p>Dude pay attention. If you face legal consequences for not wearing a piece of cloth, it violates your rights. </p>
<p>It’s like saying, if the government forces me to say a prayer to not get arrested, what’s the harm? I can just say the prayer. It’s just words.</p>

        <p>"You people" I mean you authoritarian germophobes that completely ignore actual science and cheer the government on as they systematically destroy each and every one of your god given rights. There is no evidence that masks or social distancing do anything to prevent the spread of a virus that is less lethal than the flu. Do you bot understand? 99.99 percent of people will not get infected, and 99.999 percent of people will not doe from it. People with pre existing conditions should take care of themselves, while the rest of us go on about our daily life. Keep living in fear of the cooties. Keep acting like you're trying to save peoples lives, when you are in fact destroying peoples entire life. "Stop worrying about your life, goals, dreams, and everything you've ever worked for! We're doing this for your own good!"</p>

        <p>My source is called "basic mathematics". Take any county in the USA. Search for the population. Then search for covid deaths in that county. Divide. </p>
<p>Do the same for covid cases. Just positive tests, not deaths. </p>
<p>If you're really feeling like you need a fresh snack of reality, look up the ages of the deaths in one of those counties. Then only use the deaths of people under 60 in your division. Survivability of an average age and health is insanely high. Probably somewhere in the ballpark of 99.999999999999999%. Just saying. </p>
<p>If you're auntie and grandma both died from corona, which I highly doubt, that is an insane statistical anomaly and in no way should alter your opinion of cooties. </p>
<p>Now, when I say I doubt your claims, it's not just doubting you. You may actually believe they died from cooties. Some people take longer to learn than others, and even more people are very easily manipulated. </p>
<p>Did you know there is no guidelines for listing someone as a cootie death? There is exactly zero safe guard to ensure accurate data? And, unsurprisingly, hospitals are handed a fat stack of cash for listing cause of death as covid. </p>
<p>Isn't that suspicious? Don't you find that weird? The government, who cares SO much about the health of it's citizens, doesn't seem to be taking the super cooties seriously. They are incentivizing people to falsely report data, and why wouldn't they? They cant get in trouble. </p>
<h1>All they have to do is check a box to receive federal stacks. Nothing else is required.</h1>
<p>Imagine if I came up to you and said "Hey, I'll give you 40k to check this box admitting you're a faggot. Don't worry, there will be zero negative consequences and we will censor and shout down anyone that questions your faggotry" </p>
<p>If they were actually concerned with your well being they would have accurate data. If this shit were actually deadly enough to destroy the country, they wouldnt have had to do it themselves through illegal rEcOmMeNdAtIoNs and mAnDaTeS. </p>
<p>The economic and societal destruction caused by a statistical nothingburger will take a century to repair. Likely even longer. But guess what? The world won't make it that far. We have idiots like yourself cheering on the destruction of every non-corporate business. You are choosing to side with the government, the media, and the billionaires. There are millions of people like you. You trust the CIA talking heads on the TV more than your own neighbor. </p>
<p>And you more than likely call anyone that suggests sinister plans of these whack jobs 'conspiracy theorists'. </p>
<p>It's really amazing that I havent been able to inform a single redditor enough to make them at least question their beliefs. It's almost as if it's all astroturfed lies and garbage. Which brings us all the way back to point A, your dEad auntie and nana. Full circle. Open your fucking eyes and stop cheering for the villains.</p>

        <p>...what? Do you think people who have asthma and copd should have to wear masks? Even if there is negative health effects? How about people with compromised immune systems? Should they have to walk around with a petri dish on their face, increasing their chances of getting sick? Is a 99.99 percent survival rate enough to reduce government restrictions? Clearly not, so when do you think they should be lifted? 99.999%? 99.9999%?</p>

        <p>If we were discussing just wearing it for groceries for a few months, then we could have a reasonable discussion. I’m not totally opposed to some temporary measures to flatten the curve. That being said, cloth masking has minimal impacts but au would agree it’s better than nothing. That is why rules should be adopted that achieve benefits without giving too much freedom up.</p>
<p>However, the goalposts now keep moving moving. Where I live the temporary mandate while we shop suddenly looks like it will be place for a few years and I’m required to wear one as soon a I leave my home. Ours isnt even as bad as other cities.</p>
<p>Re: your family that died of COVID 19, what about people who have family die in car crashes? Can they demand that the speed limit be reduced to 10 MPH?</p>

        <p>1) The area in which you shop - was there a reasoning for the sudden change of pace? I would presume that this behaviour would occur after some statistic suddenly spiked or something along those lines. Even if it's not 'as bad' as other cities, it can still be bad, right? </p>
<p>2) I don't think the car comparison is quite the same, but I do see where you're coming from - but...</p>
<p>a) Car companies are constantly looking at how to improve safety, which can't compare to COVID because we don't know exactly how it works yet.</p>
<p>b) Are the amount of crashes fluctuating or are they relatively stable? Because of the nature of COVID, infection or death rates are kind of volatile as we try to find a vaccine.</p>
<p>I feel like I've missed something in your explaination, so please just let me know what you think.</p>

        <p>The sudden change of pace where we need to wear one as soon as we leave our apartments was so the mayor could score points with suburban mask stans by making us poor people who live in buildings know our role. It wasn’t due to outbreaks or anything “scientific”.</p>

        <p>I’m in Canada, there’s nothing scientific about it. It’s virtue signalling. </p>
<p>Demanding people wear masks to exist outside (what most mask stans want) is equivalent to asking drivers to drive 10 MPH. That’s the point. I know you probably drive everywhere so you don’t get how much mask laws are an attempt to urban culture uncomfortable for us poor people and basically turn everything into a giant American suburb.</p>

        <p>When surgical masks were first designed and made, they were made with the sole purpose of blocking phlegm from infecting other people if you were to cough or sneeze on them. Why anyone would cough or sneeze on another person is beyond me. </p>
<p>Surgeons and nurses in the operating room have their hands busy so it made sense that they would wear them and they do for that reason. </p>
<p>When SARS came out, the CDC guidelines stated very clearly that unless you are actively coughing and sneezing, surgical masks served no purpose.  The one and only mask in the entire universe, according to that same paper, that offered any protection was an N-95 respirator that was properly fitted each time by a professional. And you had to throw it away each day you used it and put on a fresh one. </p>
<p>Covid-19 is a very close relative to SARS. They are actually called SARS-COV-1 and SARS-COV-2. </p>
<p>So if you genuinely feel that this virus is deadly and since your family has been so affected, wouldn’t you want to use masks that actually work?</p>

<p>Surgical masks are designed to 'catch' anything (that's larger than air) from coming out of you to anyone else from exhaling or anything else out of your nose or mouth.</p>
<p>I wear a mask as a procaution in the event in which I have asymptomatic COVID-19, because I haven't been tested.</p>
<p>Doctors and nurses wear masks in order to not breath on the patient they're operating on as to not inadvertently cause any infection or other complication. </p>
<p>And YES. As a matter of fact, I DO believe that this virus can be VERY deadly indeed. I would like to take EVERY precaution nessasary in order to prevent anyone else from going through what I have - and because I have no medical diploma or anything I want to trust the people that do in order to protect anyone and everyone around me.</p>
<p>Here's a question for you, now - for what reason may people want to wear masks, or even lock down? Does anyone want to? Of course not. It is, when implemented, a nessasary procaution given out by professionals who know what they're doing.</p>
<p>Sorry for sounding aggressive.</p>

        <p>Catching stuff that comes out of your mouth- that’s what I said. Phlegm is an example of that. Please don’t ask me to list every single example. And no, people don’t normally spew shit out of their mouths like a fire hose under normal exhalation.  If you honestly thought that masks catch shit each and every time you breath out, why the hell would you put that thing back on your face?  It would be soaked in slime after each use.

        <p>Yes. All masks. Masks lose effectiveness after each use. Surgical masks are to be tossed after no more than 8 hours. N-95 masks too. </p>
<p>But if they were really soaked in shit, no one would ever be reusing them.</p>
<p>Sneeze inside your mask just once. And then wear it the rest of the day.  I work in a hospital. Masks are free for me.</p>

        <p>At the present time, the widespread use of masks everywhere is not supported by high-quality scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Hence, if you want to protect your family, choose other methods. Universal masking is not the answer.</p>

<p>Masks doesn't work when the majority of people are using them wrong. They forget hand washing, touch their face etc. They've not same training as medical professionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk of short supply for medical staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication is harder. E.g. for deaf, autistic, auditory processing disorder, claustrophobic, anxious and PTSD affected. But also harder to read facial expressions for most people.</p>

<p>Mental health conditions and disabilities. I mentioned them on number 3.</p>

<p>Yes, the COVID19 is a real virus and the most vulnerable may die. But it doesn't mean the majority dies or that masks are effective.</p>

<p>I understand what's going on here now, thank you guys for your comments. I guess I was just at a unlucky end of life.</p>
<p>I'm willing to do my best to reduce the spread of COVID, so lockdowns, to me, seem nessasary in some areas which are badly effected. I trust the scientists where I am.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't know why. I personally think the virus is real, but blown out of proportions and aren't as bad that's worth the lockdown now. It's not as dangerous as Ebola. Not much bigger danger than the flu either.</p>

        <p>Ebola didn't reach the scale that COVID has, and we don't have a vaccine for it yet unlike the flu. I think that the precautions taken (lockdowns) were nessasary because we don't know much about COVID, and there are severe cases of it too (which require ventalators and such).</p>
<p>Your point before of 'stress for hospital workers' (sorry I can't say exactly what you said, I'm on mobile), to me, says that it's worse than the flu as well.</p>

        <p>It's only higher than flu at all for populations over 50. It's <em>less</em> lethal than flu for children and teenagers, and for adults up to 50 both illnesses are about the same. It's hard to separate that from general co-morbidities, older people have more, so healthy, fit people in roughly the 50-65 range might be at near flu-equivalent risk too. But that's less clear.</p>

<p>I also need to look up what happened to people on ventalators in hospitals. I'll get back to you, but thinking about it, if people are in hospitals on ventilators could people still be alive but just permanently on ventalators?</p>

        <p>I also am an individual who has family members badly affected by Covid-1984. They live in New York City, where I believe the virus did things that will never be replicated. They did get symptoms and the level of fear in New York was enough to kill a healthy person with Corona. Imagine police driving around on loudspeakers telling people to keep 6 feet apart and your neighborhood reduced to a ghost town. With the only frame of reference being information coming out of China, people only knew that a crazy government was locking people inside their homes and the free world declined to denounce the strategy. People were afraid to admit they had it. My own family members were separated by mandate from a hospitalized child, and when their quarantine was over they found that the child had suffered an injury while they were ordered to stay away. The correct strategy would have been to celebrate overcoming the virus when the hospital ship sailed empty out of NYC. But, instead the narrative switched to testing and masking. My family members were put through hell and visitation to their child was restricted in the ways of social distancing that made no sense. That is when I 'woke' to the virus. My family members were the vulnerable. Weren't we sacrificing to protect the vulnerable? They were thrown under the bus, there was no nuanced response to the virus, just Dick Cheney telling us all to wear masks.</p>
<p>When you analyze a government policy, it's critical to ask, "Does this exasperate inequality? Will this result in harm to children?" Covid policy does both those things therefore can only be characterized as completely incompetent and rejected and rebuffed.</p>
<p>To pretend like we're all vulnerable to what happened in NYC in March and April is to ignore the reality of what unfolded there. This was no bullshit 80% asymptomatic, the poor people of NYC have been under siege. We've not prevented it from happening in other places by wearing masks and social distancing and testing because when people were fleeing the city those practices weren't in place and yet we did not see spread of the same caliber of illness outside of New York.</p>
<p>Covid was a New York phenomenon just like 9/11, sure there was the pentagon and Pennsylvania crash, but the scale is on a different level. Just like the rest of America was not in danger of terrorist attacks of that magnitude after 9/11 same now, we are not in danger of repeating NYC. When America and the 'coalition' invaded the middle east, that was the wrong response based on outright lies, similarly, lockdowns and social distancing across the world are the wrong response here. We must protect our liberty because there is always a global conspiracy to take it away. Always.</p>
<p>God Bless NYC and I hope the liars there don't get away with the second wave false positive fraud. It's over, and it has been since April.</p>
