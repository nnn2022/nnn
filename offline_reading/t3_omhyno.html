    <strong>RSV and the Covid jab. Is there a possible link here?</strong>
    <p><p>RSV or Respiratory syncytial virus is currently making its rounds in New Zealand which doesn't surprise me as we are currently experiencing winter so of course we are going to have flu and viral outbreaks like every other winter. Our children wards in hospitals are completely over run due to this virus. It's been blamed on our lockdowns and self isolation that we unfortunately very willingly took part in last year. Some people but a very small number did experience the flu last year including myself and even after receiving the influenza jab.</p>
<p>Then I hear from Americans and other countries who are currently having summer, that they are having these same outbreaks and it too is been said to be occurring due to lockdowns and isolation. But in summer? </p>
<p>Is it possible that this has something to do with the jab or is it just a coincidence that everywhere just happens to be experiencing this right now?</p></p>

        <p>I've been wondering this too, I think it might have to be due to the vaccine reprogramming the innate and acquired immune system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256520v1">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.03.21256520v1</a></p>
<p>I think the vaccinated might have to retrain their immune system to handle old viruses. The high number of shingles outbreaks in young healthy post-vaccination might also suggest something like this is happening.</p>

        <p>I think my kid is just getting over it but I don’t see any way that vax would be responsible.  It is weird, though, that it’s everywhere. I wonder if it’s .. Covid?  Weird.</p>

        <p>Personally I had never heard of it until this year. Everyone who presents with it is covid tested to make sure it's not that but so far no one has got covid</p>
