    <strong>Want To "Red Pill" Someone? Show Them These Videos</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCe1hc8GaJs">Dancing nurses.</a> </p>
<p>This video, in my opinion, is the most damning one of all and needs to be seen by everyone. Common arguments and rationalizations against this one will be: "tHeY wERe dOInG iT oN tHeIr bReAk! tHeYrE aLlOwEd tO bLoW oFf StEaM AnD hAvE fUn! iTs NoT eVeN A cOvID wArD!"</p>
<p>Tell that to all the people who have missed hospital appointments over the past year and missed vital cancer treatments. These fools have been dancing in empty hospital hallways all year long whilst we've had to endure this shit. This comment from some random below the video says it all:  </p>
<p>"It's even worse, actually. All science was replaced with pseudoscience so that the propaganda machine can do its thing. You're now considered crazy if you don't have faith in pseudoscience like some kind of cultist. "The science" says that the most deadly pandemic in history has a 99.99% survival rate and is so rarely lethal that the death counts have to be padded with car crashes and cancer deaths. You're insane if you question this. <strong>Masks prevent the spread but also aren't in any way treated as biohazards when thrown on the ground everywhere.</strong> Scientists, governmen, medical professionals, academics, and the media are all working towards your extinction."</p>

<p>Battering down a door to drag someone away for "breaking Covid protocol". Totally normal and not at all terrifying.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nbbtdw/elderly_woman_kidnapped_for_her_own_good_ireland/">This woman</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n3q6jc/police_take_revenge_on_guy_who_stood_up_committed/">this man</a> were woken up in the middle of the night in their homes and taken away for daring to speak out against the rules/film the police in Ireland. The man's kids were taken away.</p>
<p>I've seen countless other videos of police clubbing people over the head for no reason other than not wearing a mask and in one case literally dragging a guy out of a wheelchair just for being at an anti-lockdown protest. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n0szjh/this_is_normal/">The absolute stupidity of the past year summed up in one video.</a></p>
<p>If anyone can watch that without being in total awe at the absolute madness and virtue-signalling going on then they're too far gone. The end of the video is a good illustration of where things are headed if we carry on down this path.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n59ync/93_yearold_holocaust_survivor_says_covid19/">A Holocaust survivor says the lockdowns were worse than Nazi Germany.</a></p>
<p>What more do you need to know that this shit is wrong and evil?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n67vpe/for_when_you_feel_alone_timelapsed_antilockdown/">And finally, this video proves that we are not a small minority.</a></p>
<p>Something a bit uplifting to end with; we are not as alone as it may seem. The media likes to portray us as a small fringe group of "anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist alt-right weirdos" but the truth of the matter is most normal people are fed up with this shit. You only need to look at the like/dislike ratio on YouTube videos from the BBC and the like to figure that one out. If you have any other "red pill" videos please post them below. People need to start waking up to the madness.</p></p>

        <p>The nurses dancing TikTok has to be one of the strangest things about this entire pandemic.</p>
<p>Don't you think if you were a nurse you would feel just a <em>little</em> bit of shame?  Wouldn't you say to your colleagues, "Gee, maybe this is a bad look."?  </p>
<p>And why are there so many of them??  I can maybe understand one or two, or even a few hospitals with some immature nurses who don't really understand what they are doing.  </p>
<p>But there are hundreds of these videos.  </p>
<p>Who gave the idea to these nurses this would be a good idea?  Out of a group of 30 of them, nobody even once said, "hey guys...  You know, this might look bad."</p>
<p>Crazy stuff.</p>

        <p>I'm studying to be a nurse at the minute, and my whole class of NPCs kept being like:</p>
<p>"yeah it's so amazing how they keep so positive and dancing #goodvibes" </p>
<p>whereas I was like:</p>
<p>"this makes me embarrassed and weird feeling, why do this during what is allegedly a meltdown of our hospital and health systems? Why are all the corridors fucking empty? What happening? Does anyone feel like we are being mocked right to our faces?"</p>

        <p>Mate they just saw it on BBC breakfast and uncritically parrotted it right back at each other. Honestly I have a lot of respect for nurses that have worked through the pandemic, i have as a carer/nursing assistant and it's been hard, not even just on COVID wards. But I honestly don't know how the fuck these tik tok nurses (and other nurses generally) didnt see how bad it looks.</p>

        <p>I am an icu nurse and I hate them so much that I want to smack the hero out of them.  I will be honest in saying that where iI work got busy for a while in the beginning but nothing unmanageable bc the organization brought in nurses and CRNAs from other areas so we had plenty of support. They are vile.  That sanctimonious bullshit they present makes me ashamed to be a nurse. If one more asshole tells me happy nurses week I might vomit.  They gave us a plastic bag with a Jimmy deans biscuit and a muffin and that was too much for me. I spend  my my down time on r/NoNewNormal.</p>
