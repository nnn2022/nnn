    <strong>The Homeless Industrial Complex Is Booming In The "New Normal"</strong>
    <p><p>Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that California’s 2020-21 budget includes $1.25 billion for combating homelessness, including $600 million for a new program called Project Homekey.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsom-press-conference-budget-homelessness-123">https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsom-press-conference-budget-homelessness-123</a> </p>

<p>Seattle spends more then 1 billion a year on homelessness, it seems that really left controlled cities and states have seen a dramatic increase in homelessness, as well as funding for homelessness over the past few years but the lockdowns amplified homelessness and funding.</p>
<p>If they solved the problem, they wouldn’t be able to hire all the people they do in homeless services.  Wouldn’t be able to hire counselors to provide the same services that seem to get people nowhere, researchers who do studies that can’t seem to come to the obvious conclusions or public works crews  to clean up the same camps day in and day out, pick up the same needles from the sidewalks all over again, scoop up the human poop every day from the streets. Without a homeless problem to thrive on, so much of the homeless industrial complex that the democrats created would fail, so they created a solution in search of a problem with a need to maintain that problem in order to survive...</p></p>

<p>The problem of the homeless could be completely solved in a few months if there were the political and judicial will to get it done. The national guard could be deployed, working with city and county law enforcement. The homeless could be sorted into groups; criminals, substance abusers, mentally ill, undocumented aliens, and all the rest. For each of these groups, separate facilities could be built on vacant or underutilized government land in or near urban centers but away from downtowns and residential areas. They could consist of tents, porta-potties, and mobile modules providing food and medical services.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/legislature/homeless-spending-in-ca-where-is-the-money-going/">plenty of money</a> available to do this. Just in Los Angeles, in 2016 voters approved <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2016/11/9/13574446/homelessness-ballot-measure-hhh-housing-bond-pass">Measure HHH</a>, allocating $1.2 billion in bonds to build 10,000 units to house the  homeless. Since then, Los Angeles voters approved a quarter cent <a href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/02/08/just-a-few-months-in-la-countys-measure-h-has-generated-millions-to-help-the-homeless/">sales tax increase</a>, also to help the homeless. Additional hundreds of millions are coming <a href="https://kfiam640.iheart.com/content/2019-05-09-gavin-newsom-wants-to-double-the-spending-on-homelessness/">from the state</a> to help the homeless.</p>
<p>Every major city in California is spending <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/legislature/homeless-spending-in-ca-where-is-the-money-going/">tens of millions</a> or more on programs for the homeless. But most of the money is being wasted. Why? Because there is a Homeless Industrial Complex that is getting filthy rich, wasting the money, while the homeless population swells.</p>

        <p>In 1978 there were 22m people in CA and 270k housing starts. In 2019 there were 39m people in CA and 110k housing starts. A supply and demand imbalance is the cause of the homelessness problem.</p>

        <p>Honestly a good half (at least) of the homeless don’t want to be housed. The drug addicts don’t want to get clean, and the mentally ill either don’t want to get help or don’t like how the medications make them feel. You can’t force people into treatment (for better or for worse).</p>
<p>That’s part of the issue with Operation Homekey. You can give them a hotel room to stay in, but a good number of them will just trash it</p>

        <p>It seems to be the new business racket of the far left... It gives them excuse for way more government employees, bigger salaries and bigger pensions in the name of "fighting" homelessness. </p>
<p>Without a homeless problem to thrive on, so much of the homeless industrial complex that the democrats created would fail, so they created a solution in search of a problem with a need to maintain that problem in order to survive... The crazy part is they HAVE to keep it a problem, in order to keep receiving/increasing the insane funding they already weasel out of the state's controlled by them.</p>

        <p>It's making everything so gross though.  At a certain point people have to realize this approach is actually part of the problem.</p>
