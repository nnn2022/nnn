    <strong>Do most testing centers call the positive patients before the negatives?</strong>
    <p><p>Both my parents tested positive for the virus last week (very mild symptoms), so needless to say, I needed a negative test in order to go back to my office.   I took the rapid test as soon as I found out I was exposed (negative) and then I took a PCR test Monday morning to confirm the results for my boss.  My mom got a call with her positive results 2 days after she was tested, and my dad’s positive results came in 3.  I figured today was a reasonable timeframe to call them and check since I hadn’t heard anything yet, so I called and they pulled up my results, and they were negative.  I’m certainly glad I called them and checked instead of waiting!</p>
<p>I was never asked for my email address or given a patient portal, so I’m not sure why they didn’t call me.  I’m assuming they go by positive vs. negative results for their calling list, rather than calling as soon as the lab sends them in.  They told me as I drove off that they’d call me either way, so I knew they’d call no matter what.  Has anyone else who tested negative not heard back right away, or seen the results online before they got a call?  Note that I agree with everyone here that testing is generally hit or miss, I’m just asking about people’s experiences who had to get tested for school, work or something else.</p></p>
