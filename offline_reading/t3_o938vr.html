    <strong>The economics and second order effects are my main concern.</strong>
    <p><p>So many people are going to be harmed by the economic backlash that is coming from covid spending. With how global the economy is the lockdowns and supply chain interruptions are going to ripple. People lost their jobs and are not supplying into the taxation system. They are now taking. There already were many supporters upholding those who do not work for whatever reason. There are now many less people working to supply the needs of even more people. That is just the basic part of it. </p>
<p>With all the lost jobs people are now on unemployment or other taxpayer funded assistance. The section of the economy that they filled is now sitting in lockdown limbo or permanently lost. </p>
<p>They passed legislation several times in the us to take taxpayer funds and give it out to everyone. Money did not just go to taxpaying citizens of the nation collecting the taxes. Funds were sent overseas. They were used to fund all sorts of non covid related issues. Even if it were all used without fraud it would cause a massive economic bounce back. </p>
<p>Most dollars ever minted were minted since the lockdowns. That is massive inflation. We have seen several nation states do that and the disastrous results. (Venezuela, Zimbabwe etc.) </p>
<p>Small business was killed to hold up big business. The thing is those people now don't have the same spending power to use at the big box stores that got to stay open. So even the businesses that the government forced to success will not have the same customer base.</p>
<p>We saw the rush on toilet paper. Now fuel and meat production are being threatened. We are seeing articles about people having to switch away from meat for the economy.</p></p>

        <p>And China is subsidizing the products they are selling the US and other currency printing nations while supplying more and more of the products, since Amazon became so much more active during the virus.</p>
<p>Which is perfect, since they don't have carbon pricing which will further eliminate small, local business in the near future. And if we just kill more business steadily over the coming decade, and get more production from China, we might meet our Paris targets which are not even intended to have an impact on the climate but will bankrupt us.</p>
