    <strong>Can someone provide me some legit studies?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m looking for any studies showing how long antibodies remain in people who’ve had covid-19.</p>
<p>Also any information on reinfections. </p>
<p>I’m being told that this vaccine is far more effective against fighting covid over my natural immune system which honestly has me in tears laughing that someone could actually believe that.</p>
<p>I had covid back in March and it sucked but it didn’t kill me. I’ve got no intention on getting this vaccine but am just curious of my chances of getting it again and if it will be as bad as the first?</p></p>

        <p>Well there’s this: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32668444/</p>
<p>It looks like those who had SARS still have T cell memory 17 years later which is also reacting to the N protein in Covid. Which is exactly what the censored scientist Dr Yeadon said- many already had immunity to covid due to cross immunization from SARS. The claim that natural immunity is short lived is a lie and they know it but they can push for the jab and jab boosters by keeping that lie going.</p>

        <p>Dr. Rand Paul, (one of the few legitimate doctors in our government,) just said in an interview that unless someone shows him the same proof, he too will deny the vaccine. </p>
<p>Due to his position and fame, if such a study existed it would be on news non stop to show how stupid those who deny the vaccine are.  Since this is not happening, you can reasonably guess that there is no such data proving vaccines are recommender for those who have had COVID.</p>

        <p>\&rt;antibodies remain in people who’ve had covid-19</p>
<p>That's not how antibodies work. Antibodies are produced when needed and then fade. What is important is the bodies ability to recognize an infection and fight it. </p>
<p>As you can see <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770758">here</a>:</p>
<p>CD4+ and CD8+ memory T are the first line of defence against covid. These are what recognize the virus as a virus and start to fight it. If they can't, they work with B-cells to create specific antibodies against the virus. Most people can create suitable antibodies to defeat covid, but many people already have a strong enough T-cell response to kill covid without antibodies.</p>
<p>What you want is for T-cells to recognize covid as an infection and have the tools to defeat it. There have been extremely few reinfections with covid or a variant til now, which suggests the T-cells are becoming reactive enough to covid to kill it soon after recognizing it.</p>

        <p>Antibodies are not what protect you after having covid, your T cells are what protect you moving forward. Antibodies just give a way to show if you've been infected during a specific period of time. Theres a video of the old guy with white hair thats a scientist speaking out against how everything's being handled, and he said that T cell immunity will last anywhere from 10 years to a lifetime. If you've been infected by any Sars virus previously you will also have immunity to Sars cov2. You also don't have to worry about the mutated strains if you've already had covid.</p>

        <p>Good on you for looking for legit studies.  A couple tips:
1) focus on the peer reviewed stuff, but don’t automatically discount the preprints; they are a good place to find concepts that you can search and see what other studies have been done
2) ALWAYS check competing/conflict of interest/funding statements. I always check for funding from pharma corps and pending vaccine patents(these studies invariably conclude that vaccination is a must and is far better than infection induced immunity).</p>
<p>That said, here are 3:

Money quote: </p>
<p>“The immune systems of more than 95% of people who recovered from COVID-19 had durable memories of the virus up to eight months after infection.
The results provide hope that people receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will develop similar lasting immune memories after vaccination.”</p>

        <p>Here are a couple more, one recent the other from march of this year:</p>
<p>I got COVID over a year ago, before vaccines were available and with little to no work began incessantly reading studies about my infection-induced immunity.  Discussing it and what numerous studies were finding, namely that infection induced immunity was long-lasting and robust(meaning they had a good chance of protecting against variants, which has now been studied and demonstrated) has gotten me banned from several subs.  But, here are a couple of good ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777898?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=content-shareicons&amp;utm_content=article_engagement&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=032021#.YFYY0Aj3zck.facebook">JAMA</a> (from a letter published 03.21.21)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2">MedRXiv</a> can’t find a date on this one, and mind that it is a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed but the institution that conducted the study is not one to snuff at.  </p>
<p>Many many studies have shown that it infected immunity, antibodies in the short-term and t/b-cells in the long term, are proving to offer not significantly different levels of protection than vaccines, and as the Cleveland Clinic study suggests, vaccination won’t offer you much added protection if at all.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2103916">This study</a> shows that six months after the second Moderna injection, antibodies remain in the body and are still effective. They did not test past six months, but further research on that will be on the go as time goes on. Moderna was shown to be 94% effective at preventing infection.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/91682">Here</a> there's some summary/discussion of research that showed that having been infected is 80.5% effective at preventing re-infection, or 47.1% if you're 65 or older.</p>
<p>There's of course still much more research to be done on both vaccines and the virus, but for a cursory look it seems that both the vaccine and previous infection do reduce your risk of getting infected substantially, though if you're in an older age bracket you'd be less inclined to trust the protection from a previous infection.</p>
<p>From what I've read, the worse the first infection was the less likely you are you are to get it again, and the milder it was the first time the higher the risk of it being bad the second time. People have died from re-infections, though it's less common. Again though, much more research needs to be done on this.</p>
