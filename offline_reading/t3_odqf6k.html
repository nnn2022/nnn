    <strong>What happened to “work from home forever?”</strong>
    <p><p>I’m reading in the paper today how working from home is going to be dropped from restrictions. I lurk over on Mumsnet (already been banned) and I remember last year how there were hundreds of posts smugly saying their company told them they could work from home FOREVER and that they would never go back to the office. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now, hundreds of posts bemoaning the fact that office workers are being told to return to work. That makes me smile to myself. </p>
<p>https://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/_chat/4247844-No-more-WFH-or-flexible-working</p>
<p>It’s like these people just want to stay in their homes and not interact with colleagues until they die. I say this as somebody who worked from home before I went on maternity leave and who will be able to work from home a couple of days per week when I return to work. I’m looking forward to going to the office and interacting with adults like a fully functioning human being.</p></p>

        <p>Lol the slaves thought this was going to be a free ride</p>
<p>Plenty of people out there were like "ok this is awesome" cause they thought this was going to be a permanent change. Yeah, it's a permanent change - regarding everything else. Back to commuting you go, slave.</p>

        <p>Why would anyone believe they were going to be able to work from home forever? I suspect that is going to be the case for some, but the excuse for work from home is fading. People should expect to return to the office, at least hybrid.</p>
<p>If people moved based on the expectation that the office is optional, they can deal with the consequences of that short-sighted decision. Nice spin by the OP. No longer can they pretend that they're working from home to save people from the pandemic. Now they want to work from home to save the planet.</p>

        <p>Its equally happening in Canada, where the same have been enjoying covid19 benefits, in whole or in part, or who have enjoyed near 12 months of no commuting, etc.</p>
<p>At the start of this, after my initial shock, I even settled in to work on projects since we were in lockdown March-&rt;April, but that enthusiasm quickly faded away when I realized this was going to drag on and on and on.</p>

        <p>From my perspective, I actually hoped work from home was going to be permanent because it would quickly become work from anywhere and I’d just do tons of traveling. I personally get zero from going into the office and I have a better setup here at home already. Plus there’s no commute with crazy Florida drivers to deal with.</p>
