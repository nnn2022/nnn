        <p>What is wrong with people who can't see through this yet?!</p>
<p>Is it just desperation and fear on their part? They don't want us to be right to the point they are in hostile denial?</p>
<p>Every day it appears, more and more, that this vax rollout is sinister. I know a lot of people here don't want to go that far, but really... How else can you explain what is happening?</p>
<p>Rules like this. Censorship of side effects and death. Coercive vaccination. The obsession with children getting vaxxed...</p>
<p>By the way, according to CDC's own figures there were only 721 Covid-19 deaths under age 25 in 2020. 721.</p>
<p>We are a nation of over 330 million.</p>

        <p>Yeah 99% of them</p>
<p>So few people under 30 and healthy have died of covid it’s not even statistically possible to say any have </p>
<p>Like the error of recording covid deaths is vastly greater than the number of healthy young people that have died </p>
<p>Quite literally lower risk of covid than walking around town for a week and getting hit by a car</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>Yeah. Exactly.</p>
<p>For example -- people don't realize that as production increased, working people were completely cut out from the gains over the last several decades.</p>
<p>Just for fun I did some math... Elon Musk's portfolio gained by 140 BILLION last year.</p>
<p>So... If he worked 40 hours a week for 48 weeks then he made 70 MILLION PER HOUR.</p>
<p>I understand the average person erring on the side of "Well, he worked hard. He deserves that."</p>
<p>However, it doesn't take into account the absolute corrupting power of that kind of wealth. So that's great, we respect the freedom of these individuals to hoard limitless wealth...</p>
<p>However, people with that kind of wealth use that money to take control over our government. Next thing you know, we have no actual representation in government. Politicians turn into salesmen, whose job it is to sell the agenda of concentrated wealth to the public. (And after they leave office, they get million dollar speaking engagements to pay them for the legislation passed.)</p>
<p>At this point the gap between rich and poor is so great -- and global -- that the people that actually rule over us are so far removed from us that they see us like cattle. Or worse -- insects with colonies that need to be destroyed if the infestation exceeds ideal production.</p>
<p>And... With automation, the human need is diminished so ---</p>
<p>Now we have god knows what being injected into every man, woman, and child... And if we don't protect our rights, we will have no say in it.</p>
<p>This is doomsday scenario for freedom. An absolute biosecurity control grid is being forced upon us, just like the loudest conspiracy theorists have warned about for years.</p>
<p>But about 75% of people think if they just put their head in the sand and go along with it, and target their anger at us -- then everything will be fine.</p>
<p>It won't be.</p>
<p>PS. I mentioned Musk because I happened to see his wealth gain headline. But Gates is an even better example, and more importantly --- all the hidden names we don't know about, who quietly pull strings from behind the scenes... While we have leaders that take the fall when people get upset, and then they're swapped in and nothing changes. Election cycle after election cycle.</p>
<p>The whole damn thing is a sham. American dream was about setting a goal with a belief in freedom, to trick slaves into working harder than they would if they knew they were caged.</p>
<p>But now they need us less, and they feel there are too many of us. So they're making the cage smaller and it appears that they are starting to get rid of us.</p>

        <p>I listened to Catherine Austin Fitts's take on it last night. She refers to what's happening as "The Great Poisoning."</p>
<p>It sounds like she thinks most people will be accepting a return to some semblance of normality in exchange for a reduced lifespan.</p>
<p>These shots are bad. It's incredibly obvious at this point, and I think some people are militantly defending their belief otherwise because the horror of admitting what's happening is just too dark for them to accept.</p>
<p>The problem with reality is --- it is what it <em>is</em>. It's not "what we <em>think</em> it is" or "what we <em>want</em> it to be."</p>

        <p>That's strange. I was just pondering the idea of writing something titled the invisible virus; or something of the sort. The worst virus is meaning attached to language. Fear and pain conveyed through nothing more than either sound waves or text that's interpreted by your brain. Hence why people haven't learned how to grieve, become communal, or have any semblance of self thought. Just going with the flow of comfortable ignorance.</p>
<p>We live in the age where words speak louder than actions!</p>

        <p>I have been trying to explain to everyone since the beginning. </p>
<p>The idea is to keep you in fear. It literally makes you dumber. When your anxious/stressed/scared all the time, your brain will shut off the higher parts associated with cognitive reasoning and emotions. </p>
<p>It does this in an effort to divert resources to heightening your physical abilities, like awareness, strength, speed. It's part of the flight or fight mechanic that is still very much ingrained into our dna. Politicians, leaders, have known this for a very long time and its sad that after decades of dumbing people down with a under funded education system and bombarding them with billions of advertisements over a lifetime that they are literally to stupid to understand what is happening to them. </p>
<p>It really feels like mankind is not progressing, but regressing instead.</p>

        <p>Once the constraints become too tight many will wake up. Problem is when someone is feeling cornered they do the irrational. Over time people have forgotten the meaning of life and it's been hijacked by our social nature combined with the social drama to which we grow up within and except. That's why the societal hierarchy or ladder is rather narcissistic. Because they don't care about circumstances or learned traits or even life passions. It's about conformity and respect for authority.</p>
<p>Over time the internet has changed us very dramatically. Sending people lost into the world to which people become intoxicated by the addictive nature of the feel good aspects of life. Changing ones perception of sex and the meaning of it. Sex is honestly the key to understanding this all because we're equal insofar as we're human but we live life in very opposite lives based upon what's expected of us and our actual human nature. One gives birth while the other is the cause. Sex is honestly the most dramatized aspects of human life and it's changing us. Allowing people to run free into the abyss with no concept of the future.</p>
