    <strong>Imagine suffering an adverse side effect or death in the family due to the "vaccine" and being shunned and swept under the rug for it.</strong>
    <p><p>Your pain doesn't matter if it hurts the narrative. It must be kept under wraps or else dangerous anti-vaxxers will use it as ammunition against the heckin' jabberino! No, I don't care that your Dad suffered a heart attack immediately after the vaccine, CORRELATION DOES NOT EQUAL CAUSATION. You're probably just a Russian bot spreading misinformation anyway REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!</p>
<p>I don't know about you but I'd be so fucking pissed off. You NEVER see the pro-vax crowd show genuine sympathy towards those who have been left disabled or dead by the clot-shot. It's always "are you sure it was the vax??", "well they were old anyway, it was just their time", and "yeah but it's such a small amount of people that are being affected by it." Absolute hypocrites, the same could be said for the fucking virus.</p>
<p>Also imagine being someone who had the AstraZeneca version: how gutted must you be that your technocratic overlords have turned on you and left you hanging out to dry. No EU vaccine passport for you! I bet they're walking around with a permanent Surprised Pikachu Face; could be the Bell's Palsy though, who knows.</p></p>

        <p>Oh I stand my ground my dr has already told me not to take the second one. After I got out of the hospital I've been back n fourth from family dr n neurologist. My family dr saw me coming in barely able to weight bare bp through the roof and tremors like crazy all I got was I dunno what to do kiddo. All my tesrs came back good mri ct bloodwork emg ncv, evp showed optic neuritis seen specialist they say its not its deeper than that and my eeg came up slightly abnormal. Seems like no one has a clue I've been like this since may 24. Can't work any.ore can't play with my kids the way I use too. Basically everything sucks. But we're all in this together tho right? Thats what they say anyways. I'm scared about what my future looks like but I'm fighting like hell.</p>

        <p>If you need someone to talk to lmk. I had both phyzer and two weeks after the second my legs swelled and became very painful to walk. 2 months later, still the same. Chasing a toddler and every step "ouch ouch ouch ouch" and omg the swelling. Not a single moment without pain since it started. Wondering if anyone else has had a similar reaction.</p>

        <p>There are many ways. Doctors are but one subset of care in this world. And I do not trust the medical system anymore, at all, having had greater success with other methods.</p>
<p>I would start by reading a bit more about your body and finding out what small things you can do to treat yourself right. If your body is your temple, you certainly wouldn't want people poking around the foundations all the time, or injecting things into the walls. There are many good types of teas that can counteract some of the effects of the shot, pine needle tea for instance contains suramin which reacts with the spike proteins of the shot, but really it all comes down to a sort of balance you need to have between your mind, body, and soul.</p>
<p>Yoga, meditation, exercise, change of diet, nature walks, reading, these will have much more of an effect on your person than another blood draw or another doctors opinion. </p>
<p>You need to start over and not rely on the medical industry, just in case there is more than meets the eye. </p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

        <p>That's what I said! Next thing you know I'm feeling great, my businesses are thriving, my family is healthy. I haven't been sick in years (knock on wood).</p>
<p>The thing that really did it for me was (as cheesy as it sounds) the reconnection with my higher self, the person I know I could be. Realizing I am NOT a sick leper, realizing I CAN learn the jargon and stats the doctors use, knowing it IS okay to disagree with the pharma industry (morally or otherwise), empowered me to really explore my options with confidence rather than the mentality of "oh well I am not a doctor so I don't know xyz", it's just not true. You are capable of so much more than people tell you, you CAN learn how to self diagnose, you CAN take your health into your own hands, you are NOT at risk of dying from the next big disease the media pushes, you are NOT a leper, and you should categorically reject those who try to trap you into a self loathing cycle where medications and drugs are your only salvation. </p>
<p>Your body has the best immune system on the planet and it would function just fine if we weren't constantly bombarding it with different tests, strange chemicals made in labs, chemicals in our food, water, air, cleaning supplies, and drugs from pharma pushers.</p>

        <p>I've always been a bit wary of vaccines, having looked at the actual research which shows they haven't really done that much for us.</p>
<p>Most of the improvements in health and eradication of disease has been from cleaner water and better sanitation, not vaccines. Vaccines have helped here and there, and also harmed here and there; they're not the Great Saviors they're made out to be and never have been. However try discussing any of this and you're an "anti-vaxxer" who much be relentlessly attacked.</p>
<p>And that was the case for at least 10 years before covid, so I knew it would be an uphill battle to even question these clot-shots.</p>
<p>But yeah, what I've found in the past is once you force them into a corner and they have to admit the vaccines DO HURT PEOPLE? Then they just shrug and say "It's a small price to pay, it's just a tiny percentage."</p>
<p>So meh, fuck dem peoples huh? Fukem. They don't count.</p>
<p>That's the attitude you can expect if you're harmed. They'll deny and deny until absolutely forced to accept it, where they'll admit they don't give a shit anyway.</p>

        <p>Glad to see another well-researched 'anti-vaxxer.' I agree with you that virtually all the improvement in health is because of better sanitation, better ventilation, better nutrition, access to clean water and the reclassification of diseases.</p>

        <p>Almost lost a family member (sister in law). I saw her with burst blood vessels covering her body, getting the diagnosis that her platelet count was almost at zero, watching those burst blood vessels become an almost full-body bruise, and everyone having to treat her like a fragile porcelain doll, since she could literally bleed out from a small cut. Weeks of treatments at a cancer center receiving platelets, and she's finally getting back to normal. </p>
<p>But I can't fucking even talk about it, because it "fear mongering". Motherfuckers, seeing someone almost die IS terrifying.</p>

        <p>Right there with you. I currently work in a community fitness center with people who have physical disabilities and they don’t require vaccines at the moment. I’m thinking I will do that on the side (at least volunteer when I can) and maybe pursue a trade. Gotta pay off these loans somehow lol</p>

        <p>It’s so not right. I can only imagine the amount of great nursing prospects that are being turned away for their medical choices. I obviously encourage you to look at alternatives to getting the shot but I realize you’re in a tough position. In the end you gotta do what’s best for you and only you can decide that</p>

        <p>I don’t really see what alternative I can do. I emailed the people in charge of finding a placement asking if I have any chance of getting a placement and they did not even have the decency to reply. It’s obvious they think I’m scum and aren’t warranted a reply (they have replied to every email in the past about other things)</p>

It IS unrelated because mRNA vaccines can't possibly travel to your cranial nerves within an hour AND make it dysfunctional. Y'all just stupid</p>
