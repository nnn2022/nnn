    <p><p>Fuck all the Branch Covidians who told me "wear a mask and this'll be over!"; "lockdown and this'll be over!"; "take the jab and this'll be over!" These brain-dead cretins can't comprehend that it's not <em>supposed</em> to be over. It's about control. I want to see them suffer now. I want to hear their complaints, their bitching, because them suffering only just begins to make up for the bullshit they've put us all through.</p>
<p>I truly hate Branch Covidians now. If I saw one dying on the side of the street, I'd pass them by. They're a danger to society with their Nazi way of thinking, demanding "passports" to just live your life. If you took the vaccine because you wanted to "do your part" or so you could "get back to normal" - fuck you.</p>
<p>Masks are just the beginning. I want people to be completely crushed now. I want their spirits destroyed, their happiness destroyed, because they deserve it. They brought this on themselves, and have no one to blame but themselves.</p></p>

<p>Ha. Most of them are not suffering. There's some who are mad, and did truly dislike masks, yes. But most people in support of them seem to love wearing them or they feel they must wear them for "protection". When the mask mandates went away in my state (which was pretty recent compared to other states...so much fucking hate...), it was still 75% voluntary masking. In the last week and a half, now it's about 90%. I went to three different Targets yesterday (trying to find something I wanted), and the majority of people were masked. I saw maybe ten or so others without masks on in each store I went to.</p>

        <p>Honestly, that's one of the things that frustrates me most. These people <em>love</em> this shit. They love the virtue-signaling. It makes me hate them even more.</p>

        <p>Well, yeah. That's why your "I want to see them suffer now" thing isn't going to work. They won't suffer. The ones suffering are us, man.</p>

        <p>I know, that's why I labeled this "rant". I'm just so tired of it all. I've kept these feelings to myself for months, because I know of only one other person in my life who thinks like I do.</p>
<p>I just so tired of it all. I'm tired of people just willingly being ignorant.</p>

        <p>I'm tired too. At this point, I'm trying to work on just accepting the dystopia that's coming. I'd love to believe that the masses will just flip on the government, and fight back, and yadda yadda yadda... I just don't see it. I feel like the best time to fight back before massive damage (financially, psychologically, etc) was April or May 2020. Now it's too late. As I said in another recent comment (check my post history if you care), it feels like it's too late, and the pre-2020 lives we had are gone. Even if we somehow succeed, the damage done to society is just too much, and a "new normal" is going to happen due to everything that's transpired.</p>

        <p>Don't escalate like this. It's what the technocracy wants. To turn regular people against one another while private equity firms buy up all the land and houses the middle class and small businesses can't afford anymore. We only beat them if we work together.</p>
