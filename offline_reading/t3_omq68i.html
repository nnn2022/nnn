        <p>What’s hilarious if this person is an actual person and not a bot or paid propagandist is that these idiots think the mutated variants are MORE DANGEROUS. They don’t even know that viruses get LESS dangerous as they mutate. They also truly believe covid is going to actually literally kill us all. It’s insanity. Covid and Trump turned about half the country into mentally ill goldfish incapable of doing any sort of research themselves. Completely reliant on the TV and their Facebook for all information.</p>

        <p>Not only do they think it's more dangerous, or at least that's how they act, but they think that the only way these variants become a thing is because the evil non vaccinated people are manipulating their DNA through ignorance, hate, and idiocy in an effort to make these variants and to spread them like wildfire.  We're now over 18 months in to this.  I still don't know one person who has had the coof.  I don't know one person who's had it, let alone died from it.  Not one friend, not one family member, not one friend of a friend, or a coworkers friend.  OK, I know of ONE, who was a 95 year old lady who was a heavy smoker and on an oxygen machine who apparently got it at a vineyard and died 2 days later, at least that's the story I was told from one of the other parishioners.  I call bullshit.  The woman was in her mid 90's, in horrible health, and was a ticking clock.  Other than that, not one person.  Not even my dad who's on chemo and is a smoker and is around strangers all day at his shop for 18 months.  Hell, I've practically never worn a mask except once or twice, been around plenty of people, made no effort to try and social distance or even wash my hands every 5 seconds while using hand sanitizer the other 4.  We've been on float trips, to concerts, and around neighbors with strangers.  Hell, I went hunting with my father-in-law last November and there were 50 people in camp.  None of us vaccinated, none of us gave a shit.  Not ONE of us got sick.  And we all were from different areas and around different people.  But yet, not one person that I know in my long line of people.  But it's the most infectious and deadliest thing ever.</p>

        <p>my mom is a nurse and she has seen people die before. Though since the rollout of the injections, she has seen an uptick in deaths that are being labeled "Natural causes" One woman organs liquified! Many with tumors weeks after injection. many with blood clots weeks after injections. And her nurse friend who worked fulltime, can no longer work fulltime due to breathing issues and weakness, weeks after the injection.</p>

        <p>Plus how exactly does it mutate in a non vaxed person to become immune to the vax? Literally the only way it could become resistant to the vax is by being exposed to it. That's why herd immunity is better so we all develop different ways to fight it and it can't spread easily. But if everyone has the same immunity to it then the first mutation to be resistant is going to spread like wild fire. Same with bacteria becoming immune to antibiotics. Or why all the bananas died off in the 60s because they were clones of each other. It's bullshit.</p>

        <p>They don't get less deadly they randomly mutate. Could more more or less deadly. Generally they can't get too deadly because they kill the host before they spread. However what if you had a leaky vaccine that surpresses symptoms but not spread? That's how you create a killer virus in 4/5 years.</p>

        <p>The mask becoming a symbol of empathy and how much you "care about others" is a direct reaction to the media brainwashing them that the Trump presidency was the worst time in human history because he was a Heckin' Dictator and Literally Hitler, so they had to swing the pendulum the other way and extremely show how kind they are to offset the terribleness of the Trump years.</p>

        <p>I mean I just can't see how this would be any different than the flu vax.  It constantly mutates some years even comes back worse and kills more.<br>
Mutations will happen.  It's not going away and boosters will be needed or other option is natural immunity.
I just can't fathom vaccinating myself for a coronavirus.  They have existed for years.<br>
I will also never flu shot.<br>

        <p>The unvaccinated population acts as a reservoir the virus can use to replenish itself as it stages attacks against the vaccinated frontlines (to use a war metaphor). Without that reservoir it wouldn't be able to sustain itself as it continues to launch attacks, finding a way to mutate in the process.</p>

        <p>I see the logic, but it's the same logic that was used for lock downs. Lock down so cases drop.. Okay, but you'll never have all humans locked down which means there will always be community spread, and as soon as you open up it runs rampant anyways. </p>
<p>Especially with how politicized this is now, we'll never have anywhere near 100% of the population vaccinated. Some states are stuck at 30% with an average of what, 50-60% now? Pushing for violence or coercion is going to do far more damage than just accepting that the virus will have a yearly strain like the flu and numerous other coronaviruses, as they said is likely to happen anyways.</p>

        <p>the virus doesn’t wait for chances to vaccinated, it will continue spreading thru both vaxed and unvaxed. that’s fact.</p>
<p>plus the vaxed supposedly have no/minimal symptoms so they’ll be unaware and spread it even more throughout the community.</p>

        <p>All shots are detrimental as symptoms are actually how the body regulates homeostasis via the lymphatic system - this can not be passed on to another organsism--this includes cold and flu.</p>
<p>You can not inject health.</p>
<p>It is our internal environment which creates all dis-ease--we call these symptoms; in actuality, the only thing our body can do is remove morbid matter. Cough, sneeze, sweat, urination, feces, skin eruptions--the body can do no more than this.</p>
<p>All cells must detox as we recycle millions of cells daily, or else the organism would die. There is no catching an illness other than one's own habits.</p>
<p>The immune system does not stop any invader--this idea is to make us think there is always a war going on. When in fact, our immune system's job is to remove trash from our body; when this can not happen--cancer and other conditions arise.</p>
<p>To have the idea of contagion, you must first ask where the first of each infectious organism came from.</p>
<p>You then realize you do not catch sickness--it is from what you eat (nutritional deficiency, toxicity), toxins (emf, injections, modern medicine), drink, think, and feel.</p>
<p>Germs are our clean up crew--they feed on our morbid matter in attempts to heal us.</p>

        <p>This is why any sort of government collective healthcare is a terrible idea, among MANY other reasons. People begin to dictate how you can live your life.</p>

        <p>I'll make a deal with you.  I'll continue to not go to the doctor, or the hospital when I don't need to, and continue to live my life in a healthy normal way, without experimental vaccines.  You can go to the doctor and get tested every time you get an occasional sniffle from allergies and fear that it's the new Allegra Variant, and rush to the hospital when you stood up a little too fast and got a head rush and think it's a symptom.  Get the vaccines and then the boosters which will be coming soon enough, all while wearing masks and hiding away from society in your locked down home.  Feel free to go and do that as much as you want.  In fact, why don't you take my 2 jabs for me?  That way you'll be protected two fold?!  Yeah, that's what we'll do.  You get 4 shots, and you feel free to go to the doctor and hospital for the slightest little thing, all on your dime.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile I'll continue to tend my garden, enjoy the fresh air, sunshine, and spending time with my neighbors and loved ones while we don't live in fear of the boogeyman.</p>

        <p>First. That logic is pure evil.</p>
<p>Second. The logic is faulty because it is running under the assumption that anyone who doesn't get vaccinated will automatically catch COVID, and that they will suffer from it to the point that they'll need to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>They probably are hopping it happens that way so that they can be like "Told you so!"</p>
<p>But it isn't happening, people are catching COVID, staying home and taking care of themselves, and going back to their life while still choosing not to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>And that <strong>pisses them off!</strong> They want everyone to be vaccinated for multiple reasons, yes some are even honest a good ones, but we aren't following the narrative, we aren't folding, and we aren't dying off. </p>
<p>And for some of them it scares the crap out of them because it means we might know something they do not, and we blatantly, if indirectly, question their reasoning.</p>
<p>Making an individual question their own choice, especially when from their point of view "everybody" told them it is the right thing to do causes anger and hatred.</p>

        <p>This person’s argument is that unvaccinated people are getting sick and taking up medical care that they don’t deserve, but what about the unvaccinated who have sought precisely zero medical attention? Perhaps they should be given some recognition for allowing others to receive more attention from nurses and doctors.</p>

<p>I am unvaxxed but I am in shape and healthy. Other than routine checkups, I have not used a doctor since I caught a bad flu in 2015. If we are going to vax-shame, then I am going to fat shame. Heck, let's bring back slut-shaming as well. Sluts are the ones spreading STDs.</p>

        <p>If these people actually listened to what real scientists say about why and now viruses mutate they’ll realise that the opposite is likely true. </p>
<p>Geert Vanden Bossche and Robert Malone have explained that the vaccines are the more likely cause of mutations becoming more deadly since the virus is fighting to survive. While mutation under normal circumstances would produce a weaker but more infectious virus, vaccinating during a pandemic is the only way a virus has the potential to mutate to become MORE deadly. This is rare and doesn’t seem to be happening, thankfully (yet?), but is a possibility. </p>
<p>So yeah, if variants become more deadly, it’s more likely caused by mass vaccination. So the non-vaxxed could actually be helping to make this virus as harmless as a common cold.</p>

        <p>By remaining unvaccinated, and then getting Covid-19 (was like a strong 3-day flu, with a long tailing cough), I gained natural immunity not just to the specific spike protein those pinheads decided to use as a prosthetic antigen, but to multiple parts of the virus, probably rendering me <em>more immune</em> to the Delta variant than vaccinated people.  </p>
<p>This explains why low vaccination rates are tracking with low Delta variant infection rates.</p>

        <p>It blows my mind that people can't conceive of not being control of nature. Disease is something humanity has learned to mitigate, it's not like the government is some magic healing entity that will 100% protect you from all ill if you just comply. But somehow people are afraid enough to credit other humans they disagree with- with the power of God and nature itself</p>

        <p>I have yet to feel persecuted or threatened with physical violence in the real world, but I'm also 6’3” and reasonably physically fit, and I've been told I have a “don't fuck with me” look. </p>
<p>Most of the people making threats on the internet wouldn't dare confront anyone in real life. They think they're reasonably safe sitting behind their computer in their mother's basement talking trash.</p>
<p>I've had people ask me if I'm vaccinated, and I politely tell them no and that I’m not interested in being part of an experimental vaccine study. It usually ends there. I haven't been actually asked in about a month, so I'm not sure what to make of that. I live in a blue state, so maybe they're just assuming I am now. Apparently, we've achieved herd mentality here.</p>

        <p>Awesome! Since the vaccine does not prevent spread anyway, which means it doesn't really matter for you as a vaccinated person if I get the vaccine or not - can we sign a contract that says "I forfeit any right to medical care in case of COVID in exchange for my complete and absolute immunity to COVID restrictions?"</p>

        <p>If someone is in danger for their life, I'll ask them if they are vaccinated. If they aren't I'll immediately help them. If they are, I'll say to get tested first, because a person can still spread virus onto others, as well as will help from the distance, as I 'care' about their own health and 'safety' from this 99% non-dangerous virus, and I do not want to infect the sick mainstream-media-cultured member of this society, as well as catch a felony for saving a life, but a possibility of infecting a sick person in the head, told by mainstream media. Seeing a person like on the picture post, I might even walk away and act like the person doesn't exist. I'm done being a kind person towards everyone, time to take care of my own awss, health and life now.</p>

        <p>Why are they so upset? They took the "vaccine" which should prevent them from being infected? RIGHT?! Wrong. Because the very definition of vaccine is to fully protect from something. This is not a vaccine, rather some experimental shit they want me to inject in my body.</p>
<p>My country was considered to have one of the most deaths per citizen and those numbers rounded up to 0.2% for 2020. Yes, ~4000 deaths out of 2 million "due to COVID". But of course they compared the death numbers to the infected cases and they rounded some ridiculously high number. Whatever gives the highest percentage.</p>

        <p>Except 99.4 percent of them WON'T die!!!  That's why people are like "fuck this vaccine".  It doesn't stop someone from contracting Covid.  It won't stop that person from transmitting it to someone else.  It "might" keep you out of the hospital.   What is the incentive for taking it?  I'm dead serious.  Convince me.  Hell, I want to be convinced.   I've had ALL the other vaccines I'm supposed to.  I read earlier today 60 percent of the new cases here in TN were in VACCINATED people!!</p>

        <p>Probably posted on unpopular opinion but was well received by Reddit and of course the bots. </p>
<p>I wouldn't discount the fact that there are a fair number of people who sympathise with this argument. I had a girl tell me in real life the other day that she believed the unvaccinated should be denied medical treatment (or it should invalidate their health insurance l). </p>
<p>I played along and said "Oh good idea. We should apply the same logic to smokers and the obese, right? They're also endangering their health and those around them. Why should we pay for those guys?"</p>
<p>At that point she suddenly went quiet.</p>

<p>“As COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed throughout the U.S., what does this mean for blood donors? Great news: if you receive the vaccine, you can still donate blood, platelets and AB Elite plasma! Donating blood is essential to help save lives and support the efforts of those on the frontlines of the pandemic.” ….</p>

<p>Theres also just many people in the antivax community that are just major assholes to hospital staff. Only the covid vax is sus but this sub is home to plenty of full on vax deniers(although overdosing yourself on vaccines has its own dangers that doesn't mean not getting the essential shots would do you any good) and flat earthers.</p>

        <p>They’re definitely being over dramatic but I think the jist of it, without the hyperbole, is that if you refuse to take “””preventative”””  measures you should be pushed back in the queue for medical treatment. Honestly that kind of makes sense lol</p>

<p>Sure, let's apply that logic to the other side of the same coin!</p>
<p>If you didn't use """preventative""" measures before having sex, or wait to get married before doing so, your abortion should be legally mandated to be pushed back in the queue for medical treatment. Possibly denied in its entirety on the merits of your "uninformed decision"!</p>
<p>Doesn't sound too great right? Ah but wait, that's abortion! That's different right? Sure, it's another kind of insanely private, personal medical decision that no one has any business asking about, but let's use another metaphor.</p>
<p>Would you drive on a bridge that was rushed to production, made by engineers that have paid billions in fines for making faulty, sometimes fatal bridges, and if this current bridge that everyone is telling you to drive on fails + hurts or even kills you, you nor your family can sue them.... <em>would you drive on that bridge?</em></p>

        <p>Why do we have a queue in the first place? We don't have it for most other things. If my computer (not under warranty) has a problem I can't fix myself, I take it to a repair tech and pay them to fix it. Whether it's my fault, accident, or someone else's fault has no impact on whether it gets fixed or when, only <em>possibly</em> whether or not I can get reimbursed for it later, if I can prove in small claims court someone else did it on purpose or through serious negligence.</p>

        <p>nah, I pay a lot for the queue, unlike some others, so my place there is solid.</p>
<p>if you want to rework the queue, let’s better push back those who are on a social welfare</p>
