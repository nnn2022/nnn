    <strong>Company now discriminating based on vaccination status</strong>
    <p><p>I was recently notified by my employer that our masking policy will be changed based on people taking a survey to disclose their vaccination status.</p>
<p>For the last 15 months, everyone has been required to wear a mask in the workplace. I hate wearing a mask, but at least the same rules applied to everyone. </p>
<p>Now everyone is required to fill out a form detailing their vaccination status. People can refuse to fill out the form, but will then be assumed to be unvaccinated. </p>
<p>People who are 'fully vaccinated' will be able to remove their masks at work, while those without a vaccine will be required to continue masking. </p>
<p>There are so many logical fallacies with this policy.<br>
- Asymptomatic people (vaccinated or unvaccinated) are very unlikely to spread the virus<br>
- Vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic carriers and spread the virus<br>
- If vaccines are effective, they work on an individual level and do not require everyone to be vaccinated<br>
- By requiring only unvaccinated people to mask, you are making it very clear who is vaccinated and who is not -- a HIPAA violation and recipe for workplace discrimination<br>
- Generally people who get vaccinated are also the most eager to wear a mask </p>
<p>Does anyone have ideas or tips on how to fight this? Basically, I am not planning on getting vaccinated, but I also don't want to be singled out as someone who has to wear a mask. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></p>

        <p>Your vaccination status is, at least the way I see it, a part of your medical history which is considered privileged information and as such it is protected by law in most jurisdictions. If it is the case where you are, chances are it is illegal for your employer to even ask you about those things. If I were you, I'd probably consult a lawyer.</p>

        <p>Same. These companies are all talking to each other and following the same playbook. Some are more restrictive than others, but the basic blueprint is the same.</p>
