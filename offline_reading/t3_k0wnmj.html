    <strong>I am annoying myself and others constantly reading/talking about this. But I can't stop. Anyone else?</strong>
    <p><p>I try to not bring it up, but literally everything comes back to it.. I can tell my friends are annoyed as I'm constantly talking about what is going on.</p>
<p>I also can't even go and explore other things on the internet as I am so concerned with all of this, I am constantly refreshing this sub and lockdown skepticism.</p>
<p>Maybe I need a break but at the same time if I'm not the one to bring this up to my peers- who is?</p>
<p>Anyone dealing with this?</p>
<p>EDITS/THOUGHTS:</p>
<p>I think the censorship not being on our side urges me to speak up more as well. It's like the classic what are you scared of if you're doing nothing wrong.</p>
<p>When they're like THE SCIENCE I'm like trust me. I am constantly reading about this. more than you. The SCIENCE is what lead me to draw the conclusion I am today. I can't stop reading "the science."</p></p>

        <p>All the time, I annoy my wife and friends all the time. But you know what, how can you not. It's like I can see the 500ft tidal wave of the NWO coming my way, and I try to close my eyes and plug my ears, but doesn't seem to be working. It's still there, and getting closer.</p>

        <p>Not to mention, every political-theater point everyone else wants to mention, brings me back to it as well. Don't let them discourage you. Keep thinking about it and talking about it. Just try to keep a hopeful mindset, rather than all doom and gloom, and don't feel bad about it.</p>

        <p>I don't feel guilty about it if that's what you mean.  Feeling bad at my own demise is unavoidable. It's pretty difficult to stay optimistic when they're declaring that the military will be in charge of vaccine distribution.</p>

        <p>Why wouldn't you be concerned? For the first time in our lives, our inalienable human rights are under direct assault. And it doesn't seem like there's no end in sight.

<p>this is the first time they have been 'assaulted' all at once by dictate, though.</p>
<p>the previous s.o.p. was to chip away at them incrementally by legislation and regulation</p>

        <p>&rt; But I don't try to convert the sheep anymore</p>
<p>Don't try to convert anybody - there's no need for that, and that's exactly what we're fighting - they want to COERCE people to believe and act the way they do, and crush anybody who dares step out of line.</p>
<p>What we're fighting is the idea that everybody has to believe and act the same way, when there's so little agreement about the values we formerly held in common. Why can't we agree to disagree? If they want to live in fear and give their lives away in exchange for "security", they are welcome to it. But it's not for us, and we're not going to passively accept being coerced.</p>
<p>But what we should not do, is back down from our own personal, bodily sovereignty. We should express our own opinions and values, without force or anger (unless under physical threat).</p>
<p>For a long time, up until this year, I kept most of my eccentric personal opinions to myself because I didn't want to rock the boat, didn't want to upset anybody in polite company. I never imagined the world would go so completely batshit insane, that I would be forced to drop being polite and passive, and actually start expressing my disagreement publicly and confidently. But politeness has to end when they start trying to dictate my very existence, and the existence of everybody else who does not consent to "the new normal".</p>

        <p>So late in the game, but happy to hear there's progress.</p>
<p>I came across a pair of old ladies in their 70s on a walk this morning. Neither of them wore a mask and when I made a joke about them not social distancing it prompted a conversation about Agenda 2030 and the Council of 13. I couldn't believe they knew about that stuff. Ended up exchanging numbers. Maybe they'll bake me cookies.</p>

        <p>Once you're awake it's hard to turn away from it. By the same token, 'you can't wake someone who is pretending to be asleep.' The pro maskers and pro lockdowners know in their gut that it makes no sense, but choose to stay asleep because it's easier.</p>

        <p>Ive been vocally against lockdowns after the 3 week mark. At first my friends and family didn’t take me seriously (I live in the bay area) but slowly but surely they’re coming around, and most of my friends thought the most recent curfew order was ridiculous. What Im saying is keep it up, just know your audience and don’t be a dick and it very well might pay off.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. It’s inescapable. I can’t watch or listen to anything else. It feels so pointless. I want to disconnect so bad but I can’t.</p>

        <p>Why not? They are pushing their propaganda across all outlets, in our faces 24/7. Our friends and relatives have become de facto agents of this technocratic global coup.</p>
<p>As the left is so fond of saying: "silence is violence". If people are under the impression there is NO skepticism or resistance to this tidal wave of madness, they will be even more ruthless in suppressing the few people who won't stay silent, even in the face of threats and ridicule and fines. There is at least some strength in numbers, when they realize they don't have the universal support of everybody around them - whether online or in a supermarket.</p>
<p>If they want to muzzle every last one of us, make them earn it. Make them dread attempting to push their doomer hysteria on everybody else. They'll start to think twice when every 5th person or so pushes back.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who hate all of this, but who have been cowed into submission, such seems the strength of the doomers. When they start to see they aren't alone, they will be emboldened as well.</p>

        <p>Uhg, i'm with you. It's hard to turn it off. But i deleted my facebook and instagram recently and it has definitely helped. I don't feel the need to be constantly posting news articles or sending clips to my friends. And I limit my time spent online. So now i'm not being bombarded with all these different opinions, and i feel much better and more in control now. And it leaves me time to do things I enjoy and find other things to talk about because i'm experience things besides covid news.</p>

        <p>You don't need the science to know its bad for the government to lock everyone in their houses. Its like saying well i read some studies that said it was actually beneficial for society as a whole for some people to own slaves and keep them on a plantation.  </p>
<p>Also, if you wanna be in the fight not just this but truth in general you need to make a decision that this is what you are about and you are going to be about it regardless of the social cost.</p>

        <p>All the people acting like wearing a little mask for 15 mins to shop is the end of the world. Everyone here is the real  sheep holy shit. Sick people not doing what they can to avoid spread is why were still here. So many crybabies acting like a piece of fabric infringes on human rights. How soft are you all holy shit</p>

        <p>How can you still believe this is only about masks? The middle class economy is being fucked for the good of a few ultra rich. Kids are being taught to stay away from other kids. People are encouraged to snitch on each other. The media are pushing the same bogus narrative for almost 9 months now and just blatantly ignore dissenting voices. Covid deaths are counted with extremely questionable methods. World hunger is probably going to have doubled by the end of this year. The government is trying to tell us how to spend our holidays. Old people are being left to die alone. </p>
<p>It's an enormous power grab and blatant media manipulation. And yes, under those circumstances, putting on a mask feels like a defeat. That's why we have a problem with it. </p>
<p>Jesus Christ dude, at least read up on some shit before you try to argue here</p>

        <p>Oh dear.</p>
<p>First off, the lockdowns are the biggest problem. We can sort out masks after, but lockdown is causing the most damage.</p>
<p>Second, we don't all get to stay at home. People have to wear masks for 9 hour shifts because they actually have to go out and work.</p>
