    <strong>I'm so sick and tired if it all.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm tired of being told I'm uneducated - I majored in biology. Took pharmacology, microbiology, genetics, and others. I know how to do research and collect facts from genuine respectable sources. I'm not uneducated. </p>
<p>I'm tired of being told I'm selfish - I do not care if someome gets a vaccine or not. I do not care if they stay home or not. I do not do anything to tell people how to live. I volunteer, I chose to serve, I help those in need whenever I can. I donated blood with every possible opportunity I ever could. I'm not selfish.</p>
<p>I'm tired of being told I'm afraid - I'm not afraid of covid. I live my life without the fear of something I already contracted killing me. I dont live in fear of breathing the same air as someone else. What I do see when I live my life is I see false propaganda plastered everywhere I currently am with false facts. The number "zero severe cases for x number of vaccines for the military" I personally have seen one of our own medevaced out of deployment due to vaccine reaction. Its a bold faced lie. I worry for our country and rights being taken away but I am not afraid. Covid will pass. I know nobody who has died of covid. Not a single person and I interact with close to 100 people every day. </p>
<p>I'm tired being called names like grandma killer, fanatic, uneducated, selfish, stupid, etc. </p>
<p>And I'm tired of people who can't site a single source of anything try to tell me that they know what they're talking about. I'll tell you I worry for our country. Our leadership does not seem to value the principles of the constitution nor the people they serve. Masks only matter when a camera is out. The hypocrisy is ridiculous and still it seems like the majority of America either doesn't care or  is too stupid to see it.</p>
<p>Edit: I see autobanning from various subs has started for me now. A bit ridiculous how differing thoughts and experiences can get you banned on totally unrelated subs.</p>
<p>Edit (again): This blew up so much more than I thought it would. Thank you to everyone who has been kind and encouraging. It is nice to see that there are others that view things the same way and that I am not alone. Also since some people are curious about my background and I don't see an issue with being forthcoming, as stated in a comment below I used to be a nursing major. I did fail out of nursing school. I failed out due to having a 79% in two classes, which were Fs in the nursing department. I'm sure most students who attended college earned at least two "traditional" Cs throughout their time. I wish I studied more at 19, but unfortunately I didn't and that is what caused me to change to Biology. I graduated from my university never again earning anything less than an 80%, Bs in the science department. I'm know to some of you this matters very much. I'm not a doctor, scientist, or claim to be. Simply I studied certain subjects and know how to do research. I'm sure anyone who actually majored in a hard science knows that they aren't as simple as other degrees. I'm not going to continue on in explaining myself. I don't ask anyone else to. Thank you all for being kind and for showing me I'm not alone out there. If this changes anyone's mind about whether or not it's okay to harass me now that's fine and says much more about others than me.</p></p>

        <p>you are educated and you are a free thinker and that's the problem that they have because people like us are disrupting their narrative. they prey on people who don't think for themselves and are easily brainwashed. i mean, so many people founded cults and got people to do wild ass shit. this is no different. these people are brainwashed fanatics and they're the uneducated ones. they're threatened by us because they're told that they need to be. the elite are threatened by us because we know the fucking truth and we're not dumb asses that are just going to bend over - we're going to expose them and continue to do so on a daily basis. problem is, things just keep getting mass scrubbed and they're more powerful than us and will probably always be until there is some mass uprising.</p>

        <p>I have a stepsister who I partied with on the 4th of July who won't get her vax.  We had a cookout, fireworks, and fun.  No one wore a mask, and I was able to forget about life for a while.</p>
<p>Also, I got mine last March because my employer was recommending it to staff, and now there is news about a leaked document from the CDC stating that vaccinated can catch COVID and spread it as well.  That defeats the purpose of the vaccine.  It is still a personal choice.  I don't believe in forced medical care.  I was depressed in Middle School, and instead of support groups for teens, my mom dragged me to get meds that caused nothing but miserable side effects.  That is one thing I will never forgive her for.  I know what forced medical care is like. It should be up to you.</p>

        <p>I voted for Trump twice.  I contacted my sister in between jobs today, and she found out that the election clerks in Georgia may have committed fraud by running the same ballots thru the machine twice or more for Biden.  Time will tell.  If that is true, heads are going to roll!  Now they are doing another recount in Wisconsin, my state.  We will see what happens.</p>

        <p>This has to be a huge wake-up call that no, the vaccine is NOT the end of this. This ends when we quit complying en masse.</p>
<p>On the other hand, remember the "double-masking" craze? It was so egregious and stupid that people mostly tuned it out, outside of the most dedicated (at least in my area). It wasn't long after that when Texas basically went full DeSantis in early March and the dominos started falling. I really hope this is another one of those egregious moments where they overstepped, and people know it.</p>

        <p>because they believe the authorities that claim that when, and only if, everyone gets vaxxed we will return to our pre pandemic way of life. part of the lie is that only the unvaccinated can pass it on, and that they will breed new variants that then will necessitate vaccinating every human once again.</p>

        <p>I deleted facebook about 6 months before Covid hit.  It is a cesspool and was a great decision.  I deleted instagram off of my phone.  The one I struggle with is twitter, but it's my favorite resource for sports.  Also reddit, but it's the only place I can find communities like this one to help me stay sane.</p>

        <p>It's completely okay to vent to me, fellow juice brother.  But you must remember that reddit is a cesspool hivemind and owned by nefarious individuals including Chinese investors.  Nothing here is real life, but it is still a useful tool.  It is essentially useless to try to debate anyone on here without being singled out by basement dwellers, shills, and bots.  Just continue to walk the walk</p>

        <p>It is a vector vaccine, which is also new technology. Basically they took a specific adenovirus, altered it's genetic code to include the spike protein, and then use this virus to insert the information into your cells so they build the spikes.</p>
<p>The closest to a established vaccine platform we will see is novavax, but they also use a new nano adjuvans in that one.</p>

        <p>How much longer for Novavax? I just called Wake Research who was doing the trials and they aren’t accepting any new participants. I’d take Novavax, if the military forces me to take a vaccine. Otherwise, it’s time to walk away.</p>

        <p>The thing for me was when there was no vaccine and covid was so dangerous yet they allowed ppl to go to restaurants and sit down in a room full of ppl without masks and repeatedly open there mouth to eat. Somehow covid isn’t a danger when eating in a closed area with up to 50 ppl. That was it for me, that’s when I new they were all full of shit.</p>

<p>Sure, pushback is finally getting traction, but my lord it should have been from day 1.   We are not children.  We take risks we choose to take.   If youre scared of the present risk, stay home or do something to prevent you from getting it.   Expecting everyone in the world change for you is insane.  Its not possible.</p>

Even the doomers will chuckle and admit is bullshit.

        <p>If they can just suspend your rights and enforce this tyranny for a flu with a 99.8% survival rate, they can do it for any "health" reasons.  And they will.</p>
<p>Look for all kinds of inventive justifications for restrictions and "passports" and surveillance, for the flu, speeding, eating junk food, exercising, guns, suntanning, etc., anything that can be somehow labeled a "health" issue.</p>

<p>They are totally convinced the information they read on some other uneducated imbecile's blog is correct and you are the one just making things up.</p>

        <p>Well, I certainly don't trust the GOVT now.  Especially this administration and the CDC.  Can't make up their mind.  I am not looking forward to tax time next April.  Also, has anyone been to a gas station lately?  Three years ago, the price in my state (Wisconsin) was $1.49 a gallon.  Now it is $2.99 a gallon, and I have a Pontiac.  I had an SUV 3 years ago, and it was cheaper to fill even that than it is my current vehicle these days.</p>

<p>but they will ask YOU for sources. and then ignore them when you present them, or jump to the next ridiculous argument without addressing any research or stats you've provided. it's exhausting, like this shit isn't my job. I care about informing people but why can't the other side just do a little bit of research themselves?? so many people seem happy to let news outlets or governments think for them.</p>

        <p>Agree. I’m really sick of this shit. Don’t ask me for sources— stop being lazy, actually look up information from credible sources yourselves, don’t just reiterate what pops up on your insta feed. Don’t accuse me of not knowing what’s up when I refuse to give you the exact page number from the peer reviewed article I read when you only watch CNN and Tiktok.</p>

        <p>Or even worse, when they can't refute your sources, they just go completely crazy.  I had one of these nutjobs have a full on meltdown.  They just completely abandoned even trying to appear reasonable and started talking about Star Wars and randomly quoted movies.  And not even relevant quotes.  These people are nuts.</p>

        <p>This whole thread is interesting to read because it’s EXACTLY the same thing on the other side. People (like me) who believe in the vaccine and masks feel like all the things we hear from the other side are so obviously wrong and obtained straight from Fox News etc. I think it’s mostly because the most outspoken are the ones that simply get their info from Facebook or fox and never look anything up. I have given up (like you) on anyone changing their minds after time and again simply looking up the source material and finding things were wrong/misquoted/misconstrued.  For example, just yesterday my mom told me this administration shipped 2 million Covid positive immigrants to all red states just to disrupt elections and that is also why we are getting mask mandates back. Now, she heard that from somewhere. Who knows where but she ran with it. Thing is, the source material for those claims proves it out actually in the other direction. Only one state was considered an actual red state, there were four blue states and the remaining six were neutral. So they actually sent more to blue states. But what did her headline say? “Biden admin shipping many illegals to red states” which is true, as long as you don’t say that “many” in this case is only a fraction of what was sent elsewhere. So, like you, I’ve quit worrying about disproving anything because the other side simply seems to not care about where the info came from. Many of these comments are fascinating to see typed out because sometimes I can’t tell which side they support. It reads exactly like I feel except simply opposite sides.</p>

        <p>You are never alone. ALL of us genuine people on here, people like you that stay informed and use critical thinking, feel alone too. We cannot let this situation get the better of us, because it IS temporary, and people like us are the most dangerous and useful! People have been conditioned into a specific way of thinking, just like back in the 1930s. If we read our history, we will know what to do. Gotta put an end to this before we are already on the trains and it's too late.</p>

<p>You're never alone, you're not crazy, stupid, uneducated, irrational, a conspiracy nut, or whatever else those sheep call you. Shake it off, stay focused, and find comfort in knowing that there are millions and millions of people out there who are not conforming either! We are with you :)</p>

        <p>Is it possible to start a private group that is by invite only? One where no one will berate or belittle those of us who feel our natural immunity is better than a vaccine that has not been through all the rigorous testing that most vaccines go through prior to being released en masse? One where we won’t be disconnected from each other (barring the entire internet being shut down), and we can continue to stand together?</p>

        <p>I see two scenarios. </p>
<ol>
<li>The vax deaths and side effects will be like 1-5% which is just enough for them to censor and not care, as their ultimate goal is a total digital surveillance and social credit score type ubi. </li>
</ol>
<p>Or </p>
<ol>
<li>They realized the spike protein/ADE stuff is way worse than they thought, and will literally kill tens of millions of the vaxed within the next couple years, probably start to hit hard this winter. 
So they're trying to force everyone to vax to cover their tracks so they can blame a variant and not the poison they gave everyone. </li>

        <p>Biochemistry degree here - doing a Masters in data science. Love it when everyone says I'm anti-science whenever I question anything. No actually I understand both healthcare and statistics very well, likely better than most. Questioning isn't anti-science. It is science.</p>

        <p>I have a bachelors in biology and dental hygiene. My job is NUMBER ONE for aerosol disease, so guess what the majority of my education centered around. I get called stupid, and uneducated all. the. time. </p>
<p>Probably because I dip out of heated convos on Reddit after I start them, though. Lol. I don’t like sitting and typing, and I’m always on mobile so I don’t sit and link sources like I should. But I just know they don’t care anyway.</p>

        <p>They must have some reason for pushing the fear again. </p>
<p>My opinion is the vaccine is going to kill a decent amount of them and the only way to cover their tracks is to force everyone to get it so they can blame a "variant" and not the mRNA poison they gave out. 
If 50% of the population is fine while the other is dropping dead it'd just become too obvious. </p>
<p>I really see no other reason why for this new hysterical push.</p>
<p>My question now is, will the vaccine kill like 5% of them or did they somehow underestimate the spike protein shit and it will literally kill tens of millions of them and this winter will be like an apocalypse. </p>
<p>They're clearly afraid of something.</p>

        <p>I feel like it’s mainly just to stop all the protesting. Notice how much protesting was picking up steam before Covid? The internet was finally starting to get used as a tool to unite people against those who oppress them. People were standing together globally. Around the world they were getting tired of being idle while shit went down. Real convenient that now everyone is required to be indoors again, not to gather in public and to keep a mask over their mouth. Except when they’re funding big businesses like casinos and sports lol.</p>
<p>And then oh look, it starts to fade away and people start to gather and protest new injustices, and then boom new wave and delta and this and that. All while big pharma cashes out, Pfizer posts its best quarter ever and the government turns citizen against citizen with easy misdirects instead of letting them stand together against the real enemies. You even see it here with misguided people wishing ill on people who got the vaccine after being bombarded with lies and acting on what they believed to be the best choice to help others. They aren’t the enemy, they’re your friends and neighbors and co-workers just trying to survive and do right by their friends and families just like you. They just fell victim to the constant noise and propaganda.</p>
<p>That’s the thing with large organizations, when you go high enough up you see it’s just a bunch of humans like you and I desperately jockeying for position and self-service. They aren’t special, they’re just doing everything they can to cling to a life built on privilege and wealth. There’s no reason the government would be any different.</p>

        <p>That's a little too wild for me ha. I think they're probably just milking this mild spike from the scary Delta variant to have an excuse to print more money and push more big Government agenda items like the quadrillion dollar infrastructure bill and whatever else they've got planned. </p>
<p>Probably need one more push to get student loan forgiveness through, rental forgiveness, who knows what they're after.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm lucky to have moved to red state a few years back. Everyone here is fairly chill too. I am concerned about federal vaccine mandates or indirect mandates to bully people into taking it, like not allowing air travel without it etc. </p>
<p>Pretty fucked up that they can mandate and push an entire population to take an emergency approved medication that is based on brand new tech that has never seen full approval before and that the inventor himself is voicing concerns over. Like, what the actual fuck? If you're going to mandate it, you better be 100% certain it's safe.</p>
<p>...or you know at least be willing to let the companies be able to get sued for false claims if it's not. But thanks to Operation Warpspeed even that can't happen. It's absolute clown world out there.</p>

        <p>I hear you! My mother was on me again today. "Your uncle is so worried about you, he's afraid you'll die of Covid" Seriously people. I have a Masters degree in microbiology. I have taken a ton of immunology. I am an excellent researcher, and I enjoy doing research. I am far more educated about Covid and the vaccine than you yahoos (the ones in my family) who are getting your info from MSM. I am almost certain I have already had Covid. I have done the risk benefit analysis and I'm not getting the vaccine. Tired of the people in my family thinking I don't know what I'm talking about.</p>

        <p>it's kind of difficult because so much of the data around covid has been horribly mangled. from the false positives in PCR tests to the CDC no longer counting infection rates in vaccinated people, to the fact that research papers will be withdrawn and go through peer review AGAIN if they are critical of vaccines or their efficacy and they start to get a lot of attention. it  makes it difficult for people who consider themselves to have a good handle on how to distinguish fact from fiction when so many 'official' looking sources have fallen prey to corruption. personally I like to show the data around ivermectin and ask why that's not being used when it's more effective than any vaccine, and also ask why it's been so heavily suppressed while experimental drugs are forced on us. </p>
<p>I also like to listen to scientists and physicians who have an even keeled approach about them and can see the merits and downsides of a variety of topics, instead of just being 'VACCINE GOOD' or even 'VACCINE BAD'. Robert Malone and Peter McCullough have been my go-tos, but there are many others, unfortunately many who have also been censored heavily.</p>

        <p>I am also the part of the experiment that is unvaccinated... and I've been bullyed and threatened too.   The best thing you can do is to be happy. Since everything is vibration and energy, we raise the vibe of the entire planet when we find reasons to laugh, appreciate and smile. So please remember to do what it takes to be as happy as possible no matter what they threaten us with, we must stand together and fight for our rights..... I'm vaccine free and couldn't be more happy and healthy.   </p>
<p>P.S.  I have 2 vaccinated friends that all of a sudden have heart problems, one of them is in the hospital now...   I am so worried about my fully-vaccinated friends and family, way more than them getting COVID.</p>

        <p>it’s really hard to grasp for me because i have adhd so i’ve been told i was stupid (my shit dad but i ditched his ass long time ago lol) my whole life. then i get diagnosed at thirty &amp; i can actually prioritize my thoughts haha. what’s scary is i’m relatively smart i would even say but i look at the world &amp; always assume people are more intelligent than they actually are. i’m like no way i could be smarter than most people, i struggled in school but i guess i was just overestimating everyone else’s intelligence. still hard to accept that the average person is stupid &amp; that half of them are even worse. it’s like why can’t i be living in ignorant bliss hahaha. good luck &amp; stay safe 😇</p>

<p>Take that as a good thing. It means you can discount what the person is saying. If they can make completely untrue assumptions about you based on no information, then what makes you think they put any more thought into their other views?</p>

        <p>You’re not alone. I work for NYC. They just announced vaccine mandates and mandatory tested for unvaccinated. That’ll probably change soon to a total vaccine mandate only. I’m a software engineer. I’m a well educated individual. Probably going to lose my job over it when vaccines are inevitably mandated entirely. You’re not alone my friend. I promise.

        <p>We had every chance prior to the vaccines to handle covid much earlier and more efficiently. Develop herd immunity. Pharmacological options like hcq to treat covid symptoms. Better news coverage to stop the hysteria (I NEVER imagined the reaction to this virus to be as bad as it has become). But no. It was an opportunity for powerful people to get even more control. Shut people’s lives down and actually be willing to do so. And it’s working. </p>
<p>I’m a nurse and I loathe some nurses blaming their constant change in work environment on people who view covid differently.</p>

        <p>I don't buy the news but kinda had some fear. I followed some covid subs and somehow reddit recommended me this sub. I almost got the vax due to pressure. Later I found FLCCC. I'm more confident now than before. Sadly I couldn't convince everyone I know not to take the vax. Thanks to this sub and notice that there are people eyeing against this sub if it grows big.</p>

        <p>You can find it from their own words Google agenda 21 and world economic forum. I really can't see how anyone paying attention could not know about it.  No conspiracy fanatics here it's their words and their plans.</p>

        <p>it seems like they aren’t very good at enacting their plan if it’s been 29 years and they still haven’t succeeded.  Why are you worried about the “elites” if they’re so incompetent that they can’t even accomplish their own goals?  </p>
<p>I was hoping you could help elucidate just what their end game is instead of telling me to use Google.  All the top hits on Google just dismissed any resistance to Agenda 21 as a conspiracy theory and I would really like to learn</p>

        <p>Hang in there &amp; continue to RESIST!  There are many (including myself), who feel the same.  But it’s incredibly important to resist tyranny.  It’s sad and tragic that we must do this.  That we must fight just to have a CHOICE, for a VOLUNTARY society.  But it’s reality.  Many in history did not resist as they should’ve and many millions died because of it.  Again, hang in there.  Anything that involves force or coercion shouldn’t be tolerated by a logical and moral minded person.</p>

        <p>&rt;I donated blood with every possible opportunity I ever could. I'm not selfish.</p>
<p>I think about this one all the time too. The reality is that the supply for blood is always much lower than the demand for blood and 90% of people who don't donate are just lazy. They don't do it because there is no incentive for them and they couldn't be bothered. It's not political so they can't virtue signal about it or get karma for it. So they don't care.</p>
<p>And yet if literally every other achievement of my life was discounted, according to the numbers from the donor centre 3 lives are saved for every donation, and you can donate up to once every 3 months (whole blood) or once every 2 weeks (plasma), I've saved at least a hundred lives from my lifetime donations.</p>
<p>But no, totally, I'm evil scum and I'm a burden on society because I value freedom and human rights.</p>
<p>Ugh, I feel you brother. It's frustrating.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have a doctorate. I’m pretty familiar with research. I tried to explain to someone what experimental research was, versus correlation. I got so frustrated trying to argue with someone until I realize that he was just repeating what he heard on the news.

        <p>I feel the same way. I’m tired of being discriminated against. I’m tired of being told that I’m the problem, when in fact, the vaccinated ppl contract covid. I’m tired of the narrative being changed to fit; I.e. natural immunity only lasts 3-6 months, um since when? History tells us differently, yet they don’t question it, they just point the finger at me because it’s easier, it’s laziness. Vaccines aren’t made overnight, and don’t require 2 doses with boosters. Even if it was a true vaccine, at this point, I would still choose freedom over safety, always.</p>

        <p>I have a biology degree and agree it is extremely painful watching the very fundamentals of scientific theory be tossed out the window like this. Even just trying to explain why testing for antibodies would be more effective and useful than PCR is a waste of time. I honestly feel a certain responsibility to put it out there because it is clear as day to me what is going on but nobody wants to believe they've been fooled.</p>

        <p>I got the J&amp;J vaccine last March because my other job recommended it, and so did my landlord.  At work today (main job) and a few days back, there have been rumors about the Delta Virus infecting vaccinated as well, and the vaccinated can spread it as well.  Well, what is the point of getting the vaccine in the first place if this is the case?  Why didn't Biden ban travel to and from India when Delta was rapid in that country?  Why didn't he close our borders? I blame Biden for this mess!  He got us into this!  Now the CDC can't make up its mind.  I don't trust many anymore.  Anyone else feel this way?</p>

        <p>Yes, I told him I was nervous about it, eventhough one of the office managers at my apartment complex had a vomiting spell after taking pfizer.  The actual apartment manager did recommend, and practically begged me to get it.  A resident had COVID last January, but I never got it.  </p>
<p>What I don't like is the fact that the CDC is now saying that vaccinated can also spread the Delta and catch it as well.  What was the point on getting the vaccine in the first place?  I just got off my second job.  My first job at a bakery, I had to wear a mask,  I didn't at the night job at the office supply store.  I worked warehouse maskless. It is hard to talk with a mask on, and your face sweats in the summertime.  I am sick of this whole thing as well.  Also, there better not be another lockdown!!!!!</p>

I've been told this by a couple superiors, yesterday being called a fanatic for telling someone there were no long term studies for the vaccines made me very upset and spurred my post here. I only talked about it because I was asked about why I don't have the vaccine as it is reported to higher ups for unit vaccination percentage and I don't help with those numbers despite being in a leadership position.</p>

        <p>The phrase "you're uneducated" is really just a bludgeon for dissenters from perceived lower social classes. Informal education has never been easier, and formal education has never been more expensive. But beyond that, it doesn't matter how many advanced degrees you have if your opinions are in any way heterodox. "Uneducated" is really just code for "poor person who needs to shut the fuck up and stop questioning their betters".</p>

        <p>Welcome to the land of autoban!</p>
<p>Those who cannot argue their points properly, due to them being incorrect from their premise, have decided that no discourse will be their solution.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that their only choice of winning an argument, is to not argue with their opponents at all.</p>

        <p>I just start telling these people right to their fucking faces that I'm sorry they've been fooled into having such a low sense of self-esteem that they actually believe following rules will absolve that lack of personal work.</p>
<p>These people only want normal so they can simply exist and coast through a homogenized daily routine that offers no fulfillment or self-actualization, and that's the root of their fucking attitude problems.</p>
<p>Most of these morons do not exercise daily, do not monitor food quality, drink tons of artificially sweet drinks, already have chronic designer diseases from listening to corrupt medicine for decades. The food pyramid is a slow cull tool under the guise of nutritional guidance. It's all bullshit. Fuck the low IQ and stand your ground do not let them set and maintain frame exploit their lack of self-esteem just like the media.</p>

        <p>I've done enough research on covid and the vaccines to be considered an expert. Many hours spent making sure I'm making the right decision. Most vaccinated dony even know what vaccine they got, why they got it or if they need it. </p>
<p>They have been told to get it, and then got it. That's ignorance. Even if you get the vaccine, at least research it first. I'm not actually against the vaccine. I personally just don't want it. I'm happy for everyone else to have it. It's a choice, and should stay a choice.</p>

        <p>I knew someone who allegedly died of covid. He was an old black man, and I have no knowledge of his state of health. My mom had someone she worked with who died from it. Most likely it was an old lady. Again, I have no knowledge of her health condition.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, you have a self post where you literally failed out of your nursing program because of lack of studying. So you switched to biology and graduated with a 2.9. I’m not gonna say you have no idea what you’re talking about, but I will say a failed nurse who fell back on a different major as an undergrad because you didn’t know how to do homework prooobably doesn’t have the expertise required to weigh in on a worldwide viral pandemic that even the top PhDs in the field are still learning about. But don’t let me stop the circlejerk here lol.</p>

        <p>I did fail out of my schools nursing program. I'm not a PhD or claimed to be one. Not that it matters but my school's nursing program counted anything below an 80% as an F. Though not normal for most of the university it didn't matter as I had taken the classes. Two 79%s later I changed majors. I don't exaggerate the fact they were 79%. I'm sure many people who graduated from college had earned two traditional Cs over their time. These were my ownly 2 classes that I earned below a B in and  it tanked my GPA. Homework isn't thing in all classes. Hard science courses rarely had homework at my university. Purely tests, quizzes, and labs and I absolutely should've studied more when I was 19 years old. I did and still graduated on time with a biology degree. I'm not a doctor or claim to be one. I'm purely tired of being harassed, bullied, and mistreated by people. I'm sure as anyone would be.</p>

        <p>Additionally plenty of people of varying degrees are on both sides. People with no degrees are on both sides. People of varying GPAs are on both sides. I assure you my opinion, experience, and personal ability to lookup information is just as valid as someone with a 4.0 in childhood education, psychology, history, etc. GPA doesn't matter much in the real world which I assume you already know.</p>

You can say you don’t <em>care</em> how your decisions effect others, but stop acting like they don’t. </p>

        <p>I actually want to see the long term side effects of the vaccine. If it had some I'd be much more inclined to take it. Currently I think it could be a help to those that are high risk like the elderly, obese, and those with underlying conditions but for perfectly healthy individuals covid presents little risk. The vaccine has risks as well and to ignore the current risks with no long term studies currently isn't what I want to do. I already contracted covid as stated. So i already contribute to herd immunity.</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines have been in development since the 70s. There is absolutely no reason to doubt their safety at this point other than ignorance and unwillingness to learn. And you don’t use a <em>lack</em> of documented dangers as evidence against something, especially when it prevents the <em>known</em> dangers of something else. I’m starting to doubt you even have the tenuous education you claimed to have.</p>

        <p>In development is not the same thing as being safe. I'd be interested if you could provide me a reputable source saying mRNA vaccines have had long term studies conducted and were proven safe for humans. I have not been able to find something on the subject. If you look at anthrax when it first came out people were told it was safe and the issues of it only were addressed later. Known dangers of contracting covid is less than a 1% chance of dying for a healthy individual. That's a fact. The vaccines on the market today for combating covid have zero long term studies. That is also a fact. It is why they arent fully approved vaccines. Continue to live in fear if that's what you want to do but I'm not afraid of the virus.</p>

        <p>Learn that other people's priorities don't have to align with yours. Also nice to see you don't want to talk when you can't present things to support your side. You ignore the side effects and unknown factor of the vaccines. Which is fine. I hope they don't have long term effects and that everything is fine with them on a large scale. The flu also mutates each year or rather it used to when it still mattered to society and I doubt you ever worried about everyones vaccination status with it. You're just another person who can't accept that people can have other opinions than you and not go out of your way to be rude to others for having other opinions. I'm sure you're a real joy to be around.</p>

        <p>I dont know you personaly so im sorry if im assuming stuff about you. I would just like to say that Im sure your reasons to not get vaccinated are reasonable and researched. However the “other side” of the conversation are also tired of this life (atleast i know i am) and eager to get our lives back. So seeing posts saying that covid is a big conspiracy and other blatant misinformation that could set us back months is a little demoralizing. And while you probably dont hold those views i think the frustration might be why people are so eager to attack you.
Sorry if comment is offensive or just seems pointless.</p>

        <p>If you are vaccinated and believe in the vaccine working I am unsure why you wouldn't just take your life back. Covid isn't a conspiracy. It exists. But the media and government reaction to many seem ridiculous. The frustration on my side for many I believe is that covid isn't just sweeping through killing people like the spanish flu. Proportionately its much lower. The likelihood of dying of covid is extremely small percentage wise for healthy people in general and the average age of death is pretty high. I also want my life back and I had it with the exeption of wearing a mask where forced and some businesses closed earlier. I'm not waiting for the government to tell me its okay to go back to living, I'm just going to live. Those afraid of the virus can and should stay home but they can't force those unafraid to stop living normal lives.</p>

        <p>I understand your point and agree to some extent. However i also think comparing covid to the spanish flu is a little unfair. Nowadays we are way more advanced in terms of technology which makes the covid mortality rate considerably smaller than it would have been otherwise ( I dont know enough to say if it is more or less deadly than the spanish flu on its own though i hope it is). The infection Numbers were also undoubtedly lower than they would have been had we not changed our lives the way we did. What i fear is that if infections start rising again and the hospitals overload like they did for instance in italy at the start we are all going to be way worse again. I dont know where the solution is and am also tired of living like this. 
When i get the second dose ill take my life back (as much as possible). I just think there is a portion of the population who fear that wont be possible even with the vaccine. Given 20% of the population is a part of that higher risk group.
I realise that now i  am just debating you so sorry if you werent looking for a discussion.</p>

        <p>Even people like me who hold more moderate views are tired no one enjoys this. Our freedom wont be taken away this easily and openly there will come a time where countries will have to open. Im more worried about freedom being taken away by extremism creeping in through elections propeled by fear and hate. 
By the way, im sorry if my comment was ofensive to you some way but downvoting something just because you disagree with it is discourages discussion at all unless thats what you want. But wouldn that be taking away freedom of speech?</p>

        <p>I actually didn’t downvote you :) 
Unfortunately people don’t see that even the word conspiracy has been weaponized- a conspiracy is just a plan. Labeling alternative info as a conspiracy is a way to dismiss it as ridiculous when really, most conspiracies actually are rooted in fact. 
Any narrative that doesn’t fit gets labeled that way and weak minded people think that’s the green light to ignore, when really, it should mean to dig deeper.</p>

        <p>Aren't blood clots a potential complication of Covid-19? If you don't want blood clots, seems like most of the vaccines are your best bet. I even think the J&amp;J vaccine has a significantly less chance of blood clots than an infection as far as I am aware.</p>

        <p>Nope. Covid 19 is mostly asymptomatic. Mild symptoms are the majority among symptomatic people. It's far less dangerous than the flu for people that aren't very old, sick, or morbidly obese. I've had the flu twice and both times were worse than anyone I know that had Covid. And none of them got blood clots. My wife works with a 23 year old woman that now has them after her first shot. 
I know a guy that had a seizure immediately after his first shot.  There's really nothing you can say that will change my mind or make me ignore the world around me. r/covidvaccinated is full of horror stories that more resemble what I'm seeing. I'll never take that vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'm not vaccinated. I have already contracted covid and gotten over it with minimum reaction. Since I already got it I can't justify getting a vaccine with no long term studies as I would imagine I have immunity already. Looking at the side effects for the covid vaccines, though serious side effects aren't more prevelant than not, they are significantly higher than any other vaccine on the market. We don't know how long natural immunity lasts or how long vaccine immunity lasts. If the vaccine is proven safe in about 3 years time I would consider getting it if I was a high risk individual but with my current age, weight, and fitness level the odds of me dying from the virus isn't anything to worry about.</p>

        <p>Lol, no. They were not pulled because they can't tell the difference between covid and the flu. They weren't pulled at all, actually. The CDC sent a letter to the FDA withdrawing their request for emergency use authorization, not because they weren't accurate, but because the CDC wants labs to switch to using a test that can detect both covid and the flu (it's able to tell the difference between the two). Their reason for doing this is because with flu season coming up, they want to be able to distinguish covid cases from flu cases, since their symptoms can be similar. That's it. No nefarious ulterior motives. No conspiracies. They want to switch to a more efficient test.

        <p>The 40 cycle PCR test was full of shit and they are now using a 22 cycle test on people who are vaccinated. The 40 cycle test could not differentiate between active covid cases or dead viral particles.</p>

        <p>600k deaths are over inflated to fuck. You cant have an accurate covid death count when the guidelines for counting the deaths are those who tested positive for covid in the last 28 days. If you tested positive for covid, during that month, if you died from anything youd be counted as a covid death. </p>
<p>Also the covid cases in general are over inflated too. The PCR tests dont even know the difference between other sicknesses and covid. Since these tests are being held at above 35 cycle threshold, which is far too sensitive. So over inflated false postives which add fuel to the already over inflated covid death count. The CDC confirmed that the actual covid death count is a little over 30k, which is 6% of all people dying with covid.</p>
<p>Also the rate for unvaccinated people being in hospitals is so high because, well <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/risk-of-delta-variant-cdc-stopped-tracking-cases-vaccinated-2021-7">this</a>. Unvaccinated people hospital and case counts are so high because vaccinated people are no longer being recorded much.</p>
<p>One last thing. Everyone getting the vaccine wont have shit go back to normal, look at iceland. 90% of the eligible population are vaccinated, yet iceland is being hit with the hardest covid wave and are going back in lockdown. As you can see <a href="https://www.icelandreview.com/society/breaking-domestic-restrictions-reimposed-in-iceland/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Youre so painfully unimformed and you come in here acting like you know more than us. However its us that knows more than you since all you read is literal fearmongering propaganda. Fucking wake up.</p>

        <p>The issue of no long term data is what I personally am concerned about. As someone who already has natural immunity from contracting the virus there is no need for me to take the vaccine. I already contribute to herd immunity.</p>
