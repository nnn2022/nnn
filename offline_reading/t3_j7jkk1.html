        <p>I am not antivax. In fact I myself and my family have had all of the ones we are supposed to. With that said do not allow someone to tell you “vaccines are 100% safe.” I repeat “nothing is 100% safe.” If they were there would not be a government backed program, nearly 40 years old now, to compensate individuals for injury due to a vaccine!!</p>
<p>The truth is even aspirin kills people every year. And yes vaccines can too! </p>
<p>With that said, I personally believe vaccines offer more reward than risk, however that is my PERSONAL opinion. </p>
<p>Again, I am merely wishing to highlight that it is in fact untrue to claim 100% safety. On anything. Furthermore it is a bit unsettling that a possible Covid vaccine may be excluded from such programs as this. </p>
<p>This link should be shared with people. I imagine most people do no realize that injuries from vaccines are at the very least common enough for a government backed compensation fund to exist.</p>
