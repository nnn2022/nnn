        <p>In my experience, the research is a lot more sane than what is reported in the media and by politicians.  You will just end up with a warped perspective if you don't look up the facts and just read headlines (the vast majority of reddit).</p>
<p>For example, I remember when the headline was: "The vaccine doesn't stop the person from spreading to others." Actually, the real story (if you read it) said that the vaccine hasn't yet been proven to prevent spread which is just because they hadn't had time but everyone just ran with the worst-case scenario even though it seems much less likely given it not making much sense for an uninfected host to be able to transmit.</p>
<p>I ended up just googling population statistics myself, often using CDC data itself and that gave me a much better perspective than mainstream media.</p>

        <p>I mean, I have seen the logical fallacies the media and government has put out about covid, like wearing a mask and social distancing  even if you're vaccinated, governments literally invading your privacy through authorities, of course bill gates and his vaccine fetish, and faucci loving masks so much he takes his off the second the camera stops rolling. Otherwise, the information I try to research is mainly filled with one sided with ''muh conspiracy'' theory msn articles. But I am still pretty skeptical about both sides of the argument.</p>

        <p>We all are using the same data. In the US is the CDC is the CDC, thats what we have an we have to use than info, both us the anti- and them the pro- . The difference is media and government twists, hypes, misrepresets  everything, and makes sure its out of context. The CDC trys to misrepresent a bit too, but if you read it very carefully ypu can see whats actually going on. The US is really strange, we have a lot of deaths and on weird places, but the government sites of European countries give you better and more consistant data. </p>
<p>Older (by which I mean before last year) resources about all these things are good to read.
I've read about this stuff for years, so flu, epidemics, mitigation tactics, masks, are not completely new to me, and that gives me the confidence to know I am making the right choices, because I'm not seeing this for the forst time in a state of panic and hype.</p>
