    <strong>Eugenics</strong>
    <p><p>I got myself into a thought hole the other night. I’ve been reading a book called ‘The Gene: An Intimate History’ by Siddhartha Mukherjee and it got me thinking about eugenics and whether or not this vaccine seems kinda sinister. You know, those people who got sterilised back in the day probably were also convinced that it was in their own best interest etc etc. </p>
<p>ANYWAY THEN I was like nah nah how could it be, how could they be selecting for ‘good’ genes vs ‘bad’ genes when they are giving the drug to EVERYONE? </p>
<p>AND THEN I noticed they aren’t giving the drug to everyone. They aren’t giving it to people who are skeptical of it. Now, I myself have a very scientific background. I am autistic and biology is my obsession, my ‘hyper-focus’. I am aware of human bias and I try my hardest to always look at data with an open mind. </p>
<p>I have been vaccinated in the past. I do not disagree with vaccines. I would take the flu vaccine. I think it’s a very smart way of gaining immunity albeit not naturally. </p>
<p>I will not take this vaccine. Genetics is a complicated area, one that we do not yet fully understand. I do not believe that we should tamper with it (unless necessary, I do believe that this drug has lessened symptoms in the elderly, more vulnerable members of our species). It is about weighing up the risks, right? </p>
<p>The most common reason for eugenic sterilisation back in its time was ‘feeble-mindedness’. In other words, these individuals were ‘stupid’. </p>
<p>Perhaps this vaccine is selective of certain genetic types. Those who are smart enough to see through the bullshit don’t get vaccinated and can pass their genes on. The others are sterilised. </p>
<p>Perhaps WE are the experiment. Ha ha ha </p>
<p>Just a thought that I felt like sharing.</p></p>

        <p>I'm on the ASD/ADD spectrum so have always been hyper focused on the extensive info surrounding biology, psychology, physiology, politics, etc</p>
<p>There's alot going on around covid and the vaccine that I could spend all day talking about it (which I sometimes do)</p>
<p>The main points are that Covid-19 was bio-engineered through gain of function research. The reason for its release is to reduce the population of people that are close to death anyway (which is why elderly/comobidies make up most deaths) simply due to overpopulation.</p>
<p>The vaccine was also planned alongside the virus to also be used as a tool of control in terms of increasing infertility (again due to overpopulation) and also as a social weapon to subjugate and control the global population by making them follow government orders more easily (masks, lockdowns) and this was because the population was starting to rebel and protest alot of things governments were doing.  Yes the covid vaccine may reduce symptoms but they could have easily used ivermectin/hydroxychloroquine/vitamin D+C and Zinc to do this better with next to no side effects.</p>
<p>I'm quite an introverted person so I'll simply continue to sit back and monitor the developments as they come and make decisions that ensure that I protect me and my family as much as possible.</p>

        <p>Some of that I was thinking last year. America had one third of a billion people. Read that sentence again. From the very start I thought America had a hand in the creation/release of this virus. Turns out I was right the whole time.</p>
<p>Fuck america. More &amp; more people saying that these days.</p>
