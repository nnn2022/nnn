    <strong>r/Canada: banning people for civilly discussing or showing any general concern new/revised laws.</strong>
    <p><p>Here I was, thinking civil discussions can be had (as in not name calling, or even stating being skeptical of mandatory lockdowns, masks  etc) regarding concerns MANY of us Canadian citizens have about some of the new and/or revised laws such as the Quarantine Act.</p>
<p>I'm not even talking about discussing being against any of the lockdowns or mandates etc, just showing ANY concern about our freedoms, speech, movement etc, gets you either deleted or banned. It's a shame when people try to actually act civil in discussion and they get banned. I know, this isn't new, it's reddit, but it's further headed down the shitter for censorship if people cannot even try to have a conversation or share concerns.</p>
<p>Might I ad that they do not ban people who wish literal covid death upon non compliers, they allow feverish hate and beration upon any people shown to be non compliant in the mandates and laws regarding this virus, again, i know it's reddit and every sub has mod biases.</p>
<p>I do notice, more and more, in public, people of all standings that were once all for every law and mandate possible regarding covid, now speak very openly about their concerns (or even outright being against) over lockdowns and the economy and health of our citizens as a result of lockdowns. It brings me hope that people will not take it lying down.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, what you see portrayed of Canadians is often only a loud minority, the same for what people see of Americans. As well, often larger city/urban representation can skew what the majority of us Canadians really think, many of us are spread out in rural areas and do not have the same views as large city populations. It's just how it is, what works for densly populated, high cost of living areas does not work for us spread out rural people, they often think they know whats best for us, like they understand what it is to live more independently and what that entails, like when large city dwellers think there's no need for guns and how awful responsible hunting or livestock rearing/butchering is.</p>
<p>It's a mistake for anyone to judge an entire people off of the loud few, but we all know that. I think it's done on purpose to skew what people think the rest of the country supports or doesn't support.</p>
<p>But I do agree, there are plenty of people that turn on the same news station and read the same paper everyday and lap it up like it is the only facet in the world and parrot it back like it makes it more true. All news should be seen as entertainment tabloids with specks of truth, not purveyors of the only truth. CBC, a government funded shit show radio station here, plays segments that make you want to throw it into the depths of the ocean, because the misinformation is so skewed and so unseemingly harmful, to those that take it as gospel(under guise of being good and politically correct)</p>

        <p>That sub is EXTREMELY censored. I don't read the comments there any more.</p>
<p>I got banned for posting government statistics that show that more young people have died last year than normal due to lockdown caused overdose, suicide, parroting an article that I was commenting on. They put words in my mouth that I never said when I tried to appeal. </p>

        <p>I think interaction is good, when it can be had in a manner that doesn't digress to both sides slinging mud. </p>
<p>I was rather surprised i was banned as there are quite a gathering amount of people there discussing concerns over lockdowns, the economy and our rights, and by gathering amount i mean surprisingly well supported with upvotes, though that doesn't always matter. 
The support and/or discussion i've seen there over the past months has rather disappeared, in terms of mass comment deletion. Doesn't follow the narrative of everyone nodding their heads in mass approval and taking their directions from the government. It's almost like they don't want people to know that large amounts of people are getting fed up, that would lead to organization of communities and cities petitioning to open up.</p>
