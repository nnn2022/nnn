<p>Here is a much simpler explanation: We are still dealing with this virus because you goofy dip shits won't wear masks, and won't get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Cute. My loved ones all either had covid or refuse to take the vaccine or wear a mask.</p>
<p>Infuriating for you I'm sure. My parents are both over 70. My mom had covid before I did, and they are both refusing the vaccine. Good thing I was able to get them on ivermectin.</p>
<p>People who leave the house and or visit me put themselves in danger. Not me.</p>
<p>I worked in a hotel last week. 600 sheep wearing a mask, except for me. When those 600 sheep sat at their tables though, the masks came off. You are the kind of idiot who thinks transmission doesn't occur when seated, or you just blindly follow ridiculous and illogical guidelines... like these sheep do.</p>
<p>Shame you're too fucking stupid and pathetic to understand these things. Here, have some pity. I know you thrive on it you spineless excuse for a human.</p>

<p>You mean you wouldn't wear a mask in a hotel at my event, while every guest does? Somehow I doubt that. You lemmings all love to participate in theatre known as covid guidelines.</p>
<p>My family didn't play russian roulette jackass, they were all sick prior to the 'pandemic' - Nov '19 to Feb '20.</p>
<p>Your father should have taken better steps to look after his health. I bet he had low vitamin D which allowed his immune system to be compromised. Also quite amazing that you blame his coworker. Did you trace the infection back to him?</p>
<p>What a wonderful imagination you have.</p>

<p>Ah, yep, its my fathers fault for dying. got it. Yes, we didn't get lucky enough to work from home. Work-home-quarantine that's it. They where literally the only people he came into contact with on a daily basis that did not wear a mask.</p>

        <p>You really do spout off a lot of nonsense.</p>
<p>Firstly, since when are coronaviruses not airborne? This would be the first one.</p>

<p>After some idiot tried to claim they knew 3 teenagers that died of this in the US, which is as statistically likely as winning the lottery multiple times, I'm afraid I just don't believe you.</p>
<p>Even if you're not lying, you are deluding yourself if you think a mask would have saved your father from infection. Yet you fight so vehemently against us when we are employing effective measures to prevent infection such as regular vitamin D3 and ivermectin once per week.</p>
<p>If you really care about anyone in your life, you would be wise to do the same, but alas, I don't think much of what you have said is true. This is the curse of reddit.</p>

        <p>You don't seem to understand, humans are not gods, we are not eradicating this virus. Its already mutated to bypass the current vaccines. </p>
<p>The only way out of this "pandemic" is to accept the reality that we have to live with it.</p>
<p>It is arrogant to think we could control the resolution. Nature is going to do what it does. </p>
<p>I concede NPIs could have potentially helped contain it, if implemented early on. Once significant community spread took place worldwide it became uncontrollable. It is endemic, learn to live with it.</p>

        <p>The goal of masks/vaccines isn't to eradicate the virus. Anyone claiming otherwise, is missing the Forrest for the trees.</p>
<p>More masks/more vaccines = less spread = less mutation = less likely a mutation comes a long resistant to the vaccine.</p>
<p>And besides, humans have historically wiped out diseases and viruses with vaccines/controlled measures. Hell, we even extinct species of animals. Just because something is part of nature doesn't mean it's immutable by humans. We are nature too.</p>

        <p>The problem with silliness here is that you think we can control microscopic airborne viruses with a mask and distancing, and then using a bear analogy.</p>

        <p>Well the flu vaccine has been around for quite a few decades, not sure your point. Some times we win. Some times we lose. How long are you willing to wage war on a virus? Your just prolonging the inevitable.</p>

        <p>Ok those are some 3 dumb reasons. </p>
<p>Humility: You aren't humble for wearing a mask and then virtue signalling about it on social media. That's, like, the opposite of humility. </p>
<p>Kindness: You aren't kind for wearing a mask either. Masks are ineffective. It's like giving Monopoly money to someone and then congratulating yourself for being kind. Doesn't work like that. </p>
<p>Community: Covering half your face is not community minded. It's the opposite. This entire virus response has been the absolute worst parts of collectivism and individualism combined into one huge mess.</p>

        <p>Nature is going to do what it does, exactly. At any point an asteroid could also come and wipe us out. Does that mean we spend the short amount of time we have on earth hiding away waiting for dooms day? If some people prefer to live their lives that way, then that is their right, however forcing people into confinement and forcing vaccinations (which can also cause premature deaths, and an even wider array of health problems because of the 75% of spike proteins that migrate to unwanted parts of the body) for a population that most likely at some point have already caught the virus and have natural immunity to it, is ridiculous. Oh and then censoring the voices of many intelligent specialists who are genuinely concerned and risking their entire reputation and careers to voice very valid concerns, is completely counter-intuitive because it’s more important to come to the truth and sometimes the truth changes based on new information and research being presented. This censorship shows how at this point, they care more about being right than being in truth and that’s why these discussions whether you like it or not are important.</p>
