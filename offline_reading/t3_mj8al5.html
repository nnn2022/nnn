    <strong>I don't buy that a new technology came in right at the nick of time to save us from a pandemic. I think its far more likely, and realistic, that a crisis caused a developing technology to be rushed into mass-production before it was ready.</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it. When the pandemic broke out, companies developing mRNA tech had a <em>monopoly</em> on long-term solutions to the pandemic. Not to mention a financial incentive to get the vaccine in mass production and being deployed ASAP. These two facts in mind, how the <em>hell</em> am I supposed to trust that due diligence was done in the testing of the vaccine?</p>
<p>I don't need to cite any studies, any statistics, any papers to make this argument. This is pure reasoning, based off the lived human experience so widespread and fundamental it gave rise to the idiom "money is the root of all evil." I don't see any big corporations stepping in to make a great contribution to public health here, I see a bunch of oligarchs seizing a once-in-a-lifetime to make one <em>hell</em> of a quick buck. </p>
<p>There use to be a phrase that was fairly common on reddit, that came up whenever anyone remarked that using social media is free. "If you're not paying for it, it means you're the product." And it rang true in that context; reddit, instagram, twitter, etc. are all free because the product being sold is not the use of the site, but the user analytics and the ad space. And how much does the vaccine cost? Well, in the U.S. at least, the CARES act made it free. Hmmm...</p></p>

        <p>Ooh, nice use of effect as a verb, nobody ever gets that one right.</p>
<p>Not personally a believer that the addition of the pandemic to the narrative was pre-planned, but it seems obvious the narrative very quickly made plans for the pandemic, so I have an open mind. What was the turning point for you beginning to believe the whole pandemic was planned from the start? How long do you think the plan for the pandemic was in the works?</p>

        <p>I cannot "prove" definitively one way or another.</p>
<p>The early indication of "this doesn't smell right" was with ALL the measures orienting toward keeping people locked up and distanced (later masked) with ZERO guidance on common sense contact considerations with things like doors, handrails, keypads (ATMS, for instance), or anything else that would be a product of any intention to try mitigating the destructive effects on personal livelihoods.</p>
<p>Plus, within two weeks of the initial lockdowns ("two weeks to flatten the curve") my work managed to acquire got very slickly designed, professional looking floor decals bearing the "social distance" and "6 feet" protocols at a time when we were supposedly being caught off guard by the mess and with shipping, travel, and other means of distribution being shut down.</p>

        <p>It's extremely eerie to me how quickly people just accepted this "new normal" being pushed on everyone, famous statues suddenly wearing masks, big box stores repeating "we're all in this together" on a loop over the intercom, well-made signs explaining social distancing at parks, similar to after 9/11 but even after like a week or two after that, people went about their business again. It's the biggest global propaganda campaign ever advised to have people believing we're in a pandemic, that's for sure.</p>

        <p>Very observant of you.</p>
<p>9/11 could be compartmentalized as targeting "someone else" but a pandemic would put everyone in peril.  We're all directed to cower and await the next protocol nugget handed on down by the "experts".</p>
<p>The cult leader Fauci and his team of lackeys <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/28/fauci-warns-parents-about-children-playing-together-without-masks/">want us to worry</a> and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/people-worried-covid-19-variants-000632009.html">worry</a> and <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/the-new-coronavirus-what-is-it-and-should-you-worry/">worry some more</a></p>
<p>Think about that.  How useful is "worrying" in solving problems?  How does worrying work as a coping skill?  Does it empower or does it magnify victim staus and condition demand for rescue? Does it further stress people, increasing the likelihood of the more borderline personalities among us to make life more "interesting?</p>
<p>And who's really thinking of "the children"?  What exactly are they thinking?</p>

<p>I had the same feeling too.  I’ll never forget walking into the grocery store in late March-early April of last year and seeing these professionally made, manufactured decals and signs everywhere and thinking “how the hell did they get these things so fast?”.</p>

<p>Aaron Russo and other whistleblowers were talking about a forced vaccination being tied to a digital currency ten years ago.  </p>
<p>It certainly does appear that this was planned.  As for the "vaccine" (it's not a vaccine because it does not confer immunity) itself, my own personal sense is that it has been on the shelf for years, and "they" know exactly what it does.  </p>

        <p>Unsolicited Grammar advice, apologies in advance:</p>
<p>"Ooh, nice use of effect as a verb, nobody ever gets that one right"</p>
<p>Using effect (a noun) as a verb is a misnomer. </p>
<p>"Affect" is what is used. </p>
<p>ex:</p>
<p>"It was done to <strong>affect</strong> change"
"It was done and change was its <strong>effect</strong> "</p>
<p>Like when someone is putting on airs (acting insincere, posturing, bad faith, feigning) it's said that their behaviour is an <strong>Affectation</strong> and not, say - an "Effectation".</p>
<p>Overusing the differences to illustrate: The Kardashians promote products they don't actually use to <em>affect</em> a false narrative in order to gain wealth. Their bodies and personalities are warped to have this <em>effect</em>; in short they are walking <em>affectations</em>. 
The <em>effect</em> is people believing the ruse, which further perpetuates their false personas and cause people to erroneously <em>affect</em> this behaviour as a virtue and norm.</p>
<p>(Again, apologies. They sound similar when spoken but when written they are very different - and Affect is <em>very</em> useful.)</p>

        <p>Everything I have ever learned about vaccines was that they take 10-15 years to be properly tested and vetted for long term effects.  The “experts” were repeating this line all the way through September-October of last year.  So why am I supposed to trust that something that has been rushed through in a few months is going to be safe?  Never mind, I just need to start accepting The Science^TM .</p>

        <p>In a sense that's exactly what happened. The mRNA technology has existed for several years. It was attempted to be deployed when the original SARS virus but that fizzled out quickly because it killed its victims too quickly for them to spread it much. Also it didn't spread as much because it didn't initially appear in a place where the government was willing and able to cover it up for long enough that there were too many cases to contain.</p>

        <p>Yes.  From what I've read, interest and funding faded.  And then there was a virus that had all of the right factors to spread easily and quickly and kill enough people to be a significant threat.  The virus was isolated and the genome was sequenced in early January.  BioNTech, which partners with Pfizer, was already working on using mRNA technology.  They started working on their vaccine in January, because the scientist who was a founder of the company read a medical journal article suggesting that Covid might become a pandemic.  Politicians on both sides were minimizing the virus in January and February, I think because a virus actually becoming a serious problem was outside our modern experience, but some scientists knew better.</p>

<p>1990, to be precise.  First used in mice (not the vaccine, but the technology).  As far as I'm aware, the rabies and zika vaccines were used in limited human trials but abandoned due to side effects.</p>

<p>Not sure what you're arguing here.  This vaccine technology has been around for a long time, and throughout that entire time, it has <em>never</em> been approved for use on humans.  Ever.  These facts are undeniable.</p>
<p>Whether the side effects showed up immediately or ten years down the line doesn't matter. The fact that they abandoned the attempt before they even got around to worrying about long-term effects is telling, don't you think?</p>

<p>No not really. Maybe they didn't work or in the case of those two diseases maybe it was decided that they weren't a widespread enough danger to continue developing vaccines.  There's a ton of possibilities as to why those were stopped that have nothing to do with the safety of the underlying mRNA technology.</p>

<p>lol, you really should look into the history of Moderna.  They give exactly zero shits about helping people, they're into this research to make a gazillion dollars. They're an investment firm that's trying to make drugs.</p>
<p>A one-time rabies vaccine would make its developer richer than God. A cancer vaccine, which is another attempt that failed due to side effects, would basically be the infinity money cheat code.  The <em>only</em> reason to abandon them would be that you couldn't market them.</p>
<p>The fact that none of this concerns you tells me a lot.</p>

<p>For a disease that only causes 60,000 deaths a year worldwide? Not likely.  All vaccines carry a risk reward equation, and for the huge majority of the population their risk of getting rabies is low enough that they're not going to risk getting a vaccine for it.</p>

<p>If by this country you mean the US I disagree strongly. There's little to no concern in the general public in the US about rabies. It's a terrible way to die for sure but since it doesn't spread from person to person,it will never be a pandemic sort of thing.</p>

        <p>Dude, there is no such thing as covid-19 and therefor no pandemic so this vaccine was years in the making and planning. The vaccine was the plan the whole time, the covid-19/lock downs/ masks / fabricated numbers etc were all just to get the sheep conditioned to embrace it when they decided it was time. I don't know what this "vaccine" is, but it has NOTHING to do with "covid-19"</p>

        <p>As flawed as this system of counting the deaths is, that doesn’t mean every death from COVID isn’t from an alternate cause. Even if ALL deaths are counted, the number of deaths is still wayyyy higher than normal:</p>

        <p>The death rates for all the top 10 killers are dramatically down heart disease,  heart attacks,  cancers, kidney disease etc. ALL dramatically down almost to the exact degree of covid deaths when you ploy across the board. Why do you think that is?. Seasonal flu deaths were virtually non existent last year, why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Are you aware " covid-19" has never been isolated and verified using Koch's postulate,  which is THE method virologists use to prove the existence of a virus?.</p>
<p>Are you aware they have been trying for over 40 years to develop a vaccine for ANY coronavirus and have never been able to? Yet somehow in 18 months they were somehow miraculously able to do it now?</p>
<p>Are you aware the definition of "vaccine" had to be changed to include this experimental MRNA concoction? Because it did not fit the  existing definition of a vaccine that has been used and accepted since the first vaccines were produced?</p>
<p>Don't Google any of this, Google is complicit in suppressing this information, use an alternate search engine.
 But please stop watching the mainstream news and thinking you're educated on any of this. Regurgitating erroneous "facts" does not make one educated it makes them a mindless robot. I have spent hours and hours and hours independently researching and trying to prove the alternative narrative wrong and the more I looked the more I realized I couldn't.  I was like you, I bought this shit hook line and sinker in the beginning.</p>

Happy Easter.
I'm just so surprised at how many people are suddenly trusting their governments.</p>

        <p>I still find it extremely hard to believe this whole thing was planned. Way too many people would have to be in on something like this- numerous world governments and international corporations- literally thousands of people, would have to know about this “plan.” This would be (by far) the biggest conspiracy of all time. It seems very very unlikely to me that so many people could plan something like this and pull it off successfully, without any “whistleblowers.”</p>
<p>Much more likely a bunch of companies and politicians just saw the situation, took advantage of it, and they aren’t admitting to and are actively covering up all the destruction they caused. </p>
<p>That’s the conspiracy to me. Still a big deal. Just not planned ahead of time.</p>

<p>This needs to be thesis statement of the sub. If people saw that in a big banner every time we visited, I think Doomers would have a harder time making us out as crazies.</p>
<p>Seriously, since fucking when did "I think a corporation did a shitty thing" become such a controversial opinion?</p>

        <p>"I think a corporation acted unethically in order to maximize profits" is tinfoil hat territory now? Amazon, Nestlé, Comcast, Facebook, airlines, insurance, the list goes on and on. Fucking over people to make money is what corporations <em>do</em>. Why should I believe the companies making vaccines are any exception?</p>
