    <strong>The only people still scared of the virus are those who have had the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>It's a mental illness at this point. If you are fully vaccinated and you're still spraying every surface you come across with disinfectant, wearing multiple masks whenever you step outside, and socially distancing from your friends and family then I'm afraid you need fucking therapy. You're a severe hypochondriac and germaphobe. If you truly trust the Science and the vaccine then you should be more than comfortable returning to normal. If not, why? </p>
<p>Everyone who needs the vaccine has had it by now or opted out and that's their choice. They're as protected as you are. Not wanting to be mistaken as a Republican or whatever other moronic shit you have flowing through your sick little brainwashed mind is not a valid excuse to carry on masking up. Your refusal to return to normal only strengthens our resolve to not get vaccinated as it's quite clear <em>nothing</em> will change your mind now. You'll still be scared. You'll still follow all the rules, no matter how intrusive or insane. You'll still hate us for some other contrived reason so fuck you.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you harp on about it: I'm sure there are one or two people who literally <em>can't</em> get vaccinated that could benefit from it but literally anything could kill them if they're that immunocomprised and we shouldn't have to reshape society and decimate the economy just to accomodate them. It's impossible to make everyone happy so you've resolved to make everyone miserable.</p>
<p>Stop treating this like it's the most important thing in the World whilst simultaneously acting like it's no big deal you disingenuous pricks. I happen to think that taking an untested, experimental, rushed vaccine is quite a big deal and I think being bullied, coerced, shamed and threatened into taking it is an even bigger deal. I wouldn't force you to do anything at the end of the day yet you're eager to thrust a needle and squirt a foreign substance into my arm against my will. No means no. My body, my choice. You all need lessons on consent.</p></p>

        <p>If you have had the vaccine the only thing you need to worry about harming you is your own body. You just injected a brand new gene therapy that currently has no cures and I don’t think any are even being researched right now. Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>Oh I was far too smart for that, clever guy me, I saw the mRNA vax closing in on me from every direction, hopped on the Sinovac train to escape.</p>
<p>Sinovac is a traditional old-timey vaccine with a deactivated virus, so none of that gene therapy nonsense for me! Ha!</p>

        <p>I'm admittedly no expert on vaccines, but worst case for you would be the virus not being deactivated and actually getting covid right? Best case is your immune system does it's job and you get that sweet natural immunity? </p>
<p>Considering that the majority of people who get covid barely notice it, those are probably dice worth rolling unless I'm missing something?</p>

<p>My research since, it's clear I, and another lady with identical symptoms I met at the hospital, had "transient" strokes and now blood clots in our lungs.</p>
<p>As for the covid, I didn't get a sore arm or any signs of covid other than breathlessness, but that's probably the fucking blood clots.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry you went through that. What I am seeing (for women at least) is MS-like symptoms-trouble walking when their ambulation was fine before, delayed verbal responses when asked a question, neuropathy and pain in extremities and stomach. To me, this immunization side effects are terrifying bc everyones are so different. I wish it was just soreness at the injection site and slight tiredness the next day.</p>

        <p>I've had some stinging in my fingertips, and a 'restless' feeling in my arms, which I can't really describe and have never had before. </p>
<p>My blood pressure and pulse have returned to normal, almost 2 weeks later, but still a weird aching feeling in my chest, still some palpitations and getting out of breath easily sometimes, other times fine.</p>
<p>The lady I met is having a harder time; while I seem to be getting better she seems to be getting worse. Having to lay down and rest multiple times a day, and yawning a lot with low oxygen. I had the yawning thing a day or two, so I know what she means.</p>
<p>We both agreed today that finding each other has been a great help.</p>

        <p>Cheers. I definitely seem to be on the mend now, not 100% but quite a good improvement over the last few days</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Edit: Can I ask if you were able to report the effects, and if you were taken seriously? I just found out a friend of mine spent last night in the ER after the same vaccine as mine with raging blood pressure and pulse. Doctors are saying there's "no proof" it is connected to the vaccine he just took  *rolls eyes</p>

<p>Get the good, local stuff (not made in China). Chop 1-2 cloves finely. Let it sit out for 10mins or so after chopping to allow the allicin to activate, then shoot it down with some water, just like a shot of liquor. </p>
<p>Do that every single day and you will find you never get sick.</p>

        <p>I am seriously wondering if they really gave me Sinovac, since I met another lady with identical symptom at the same hospital waiting room, but she had Astrazeneca. </p>
<p>But yeah, all vaccines are known for paralysis and stuff. It can be nasty stuff.</p>

        <p>I live on a Malaysian island. Which I generally love.</p>
<p>To the East I have the Philippines, where the president is threatening jail for unvaxed and to the West I have Indonesia, which has made the vax mandatory. Then I heard Malaysia working on their own mRNA type... in the meantime, as the Sinovac stocks ran out we were importing lots of Pfizer...</p>
<p>So I went for the Sinovac, as it's a traditional dead-virus vaccine. Seems they put a lot of other toxic shit in there with it, such as aluminium. Within 35 mins had a shedload of various nasty side effects, some of which I still have.</p>

Everyone just keeps shouting crazy nonsense like "I wear 2 mask even though I'm vaccinated, because you can't trust these evil desease spreaders" or " I can't wait for all these q-anon trump retards die off, our country would be so much better" or "what's so hard about getting a vaccine, it's safe, science says so".

        <p>You won't find it in journals, you can't prove a negative so they didn't really need to fund such studies. Tobacco paid off (mostly with cigarettes ironically) doctors to recommend one brand over another, tacitly recommending smoking to the general public. And also to suppress studies that showed the risk of smoking.</p>

        <p>I don't think that there was a coordinated effort to cover up the dangers of cigarette smoke and the dangers of lead in gasoline.   Investigative journalists have uncovered mountains of information that proves these things happened.  Court decisions have come down.  Millions in fines paid.  Do you have realistic expectations that in the future, we will come to the same conclusion with COVID?  If so, what are you basing that on?  Like, we always knew that lead was dangerous, we just didn't know how dangerous, or how it went through the gas to the air to our lungs.  We had a pretty good idea that inhaling smoke wasn't necessarily good for us, and that it was sure as hell addictive.  We just didn't have the medical proof that came out later.  We have dozens of safe and effective vaccines in use pre-2020, and millions of flu vaccines administered safely every year.  I don't blame the people in the 20s-60s who were lied to.  They operated under the best information available to them.  That information today clearly says, get vaccinated.</p>

<p>Are you aware the C19 V is not a traditional V? It’s an entirely new genetically modified mRNA V. Webster had update their definition of V to include it. It’s being distributed by emergency authorization, it’s not FDA approved. </p>

<p>Much of what people eat in the USA, isn’t allowed to be sold in other countries, and somehow those countries are healthier. </p>
<p>Remember the food guide pyramid? After years of teaching it to children, the authorities had to admit they were very wrong. </p>

        <p>1 - this is a tangent but I'll bite. There's nothing wrong with GMOs. Every domestic crop in use today was "genetically modified" through hundreds of generations of selections. GMOs are probably the biggest reason there isn't rampant global starvation. </p>
<p>2 - FDA has had problems in the past and is woefully underfunded and weak. I don't live my life based on what the FDA says is and isn't good to do. </p>
<p>3 - that being said, I do trust the scientists who have been working on mRNA vaccine technology for about a decade. That's how we got a vaccine out in under 2 years. I help get the thousands of tiny biotech patents get approved by the USPTO. All of those go through rigorous research and review processes by the smartest people on the planet. Those are the people I trust. The ones that the government got out of the way to do their job as fast as possible. You don't have bio PhD. They do. That's what I put my faith in when a pandemic hits and there's no blueprint.</p>

        <p>Selective breeding and GMOs are completely different. GMOs are the reason there isn’t rampant global starvation? GMOs only started being sold in 1994. </p>
<p>The USA is by far the largest GM crop producer, all other counties, whom haven’t banned or prohibited it, produce a very tiny amount: </p>

        <p>It’s actually about 2 decades and it’s the fact that in that time they could never could never get past animal trials until they were given an emergency approval that makes me likely to wait a good 10 years and see what happens before I start volunteering for a jab.</p>

        <p>There are also no long term studies on this mrna vaccine that shows its safe or taking it and having children will not affect them 10 years down the road either. </p>
<p>You can't just choose your side that has no scientific data at the same time as pointing at us and saying we have no data to prove otherwise. You either believe in science and question everything waiting for proper trials and testing or you don't and just believe the media when they say its safe.</p>

        <p>On one side, there's concern about a vaccine's long-term effects.  On the other side, there's concern about a virus's long-term effects.  Both understandable.  So look at past vaccines and viruses.  Vaccines help people stay healthy and stop them from dying.  Very very very rarely are there any side-effects.  Well worth the risk.  Viruses make people sick, if not kill or cripple people.  We've seen the short-term effects of COVID.  Hundreds of thousands of deaths.  People with respiratory issues months and months later. We've seen long-term effects of past viruses.  Lots of kids in wheelchairs.  With no other information on either side, wouldn't you rather take your chances with the side effects of a vaccine over the side effects of a virus?  You point and laugh at people afraid of a deadly virus, but you're afraid of a vaccine that could save your life.  That's just some next level double-think.  It's not the media that says the vaccine is safe.  They just report what medical experts have concluded.   Look at how many doctors and doctors' kids are vaccinated.  All of them.</p>

        <p>For one, my doctor got the first dose because he was told he either gets the first dose or his medical practice gets closed. He has told my family not to get it until it's proven safe, especially considering we are all young and healthy so the virus is not an issue. This has happened all over canada, that is why doctors are all vaccinated, not because they believe in the safety. It was actually very split among medical professionals before our government cracked down and forced the vaccine.</p>
<p>Looking at data for young healthy people in their early to mid 20s, there are almost no deaths or long term effects from the virus, but there are "lots" from the vaccine. I say "lots" not because I think there are a large number of people dying from the vaccine but because if you compare numbers from this vaccine vs any other one that has made it through the strict testing schedules this one has exponentially more adverse effects and deaths even if those numbers are still fairly small. It shows how rushed this was.</p>
<p>I have already gone through covid and to be entirely honest I didn't even realize I had it, and would not have known if it weren't for the positive test. Same goes for nearly everyone I know that tested positive which is a fairly decent amount of people (a couple hundred that I know personally).</p>
<p>If this vaccine had gone through the proper tests and wait times I would have absolutely no problems with it, but the fact that they are now resorting to forcing people into getting it just doesn't sit well with me. This has never happened on this scale in the past, especially with a vaccine as untested as this one for long term effects.</p>

        <p>It wasn't as rushed as it seems. They've been working on similar vaccines for a while which helped get this one out so fast. I'm sorry you got COVID and I hope you don't experience any long term effects to your heart or lungs. I'm curious where you are seeing any deaths from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Vaers reporting shows these vaccines have a lot more complications than any other vaccine ever rolled out. Both deaths <em>and</em> side effects.</p>
<p>Anecdotal but, my next door neighbor died the day after her second jab alone in her basement literally just after telling me how rough it felt when she got home. Cause of death? Natural causes. I feel like these side effects are massively underreported because they don't want anyone to question getting this vaccine. She was 35 years old, that is not normal.</p>

        <p>I love that people look at "science" like it's  a monolithic entity that can do no wrong and speaks only truth.  Ignoring the reality that "science" only exists where funding is present,  and the entities providing said funding will get the results  they wanted... or they will take their funding somewhere that will provide them with what they want.</p>
<p>You know, just like everyone else does.</p>
<p>If you see any particular bit of "science" without doing your own footwork, it's because someone is promoting it for public consumption. You need to ask why.  Why are they (whoever is pushing this) promoting it?  What do they get out of it?</p>
<p>Just because someone has a pretty piece of paper on the wall, doesn't mean that they don't have bills to pay.</p>

        <p>Exactly this, couldn't have worded it better, the thing is that some people seem to be treating "science" as a religion instead of a loose general agreement between researchers on a respective field from what they current know, "obey science!", "the scientists agree this or that and they know better than you!".</p>
<p>Sure many scientists really know more than i do in their respective fields but in the moment that it envolves my life i have a say in it cause i'm not a slave to blindly obey and that's not even taking into consideration the agendas those funding and backing them may have in place just like you said.</p>

        <p>Here in NNN, people does see science as a monolithic entity that is deeply corrupted by the government. This is such a simplistic point of view, science can be funded by so many different actors with different and contradictory interests. The scientific method cannot be perfect but accusing every scientists to hold the same corrupted point of view is deeply idiotic.</p>

        <p>The internet offers platforms for insane people. In the past they would just be ignored or lightly ridiculed then ignored by the majority of society, but they’ve been co-opted in this case as the useful idiots they are by corporate media to push this experimental drug. </p>
<p>Corporate media is more dangerous right now than our corrupt government because these people refuse to see how corrupt the corporate media has become. The corrupt corporate media reinforces their fear, justifies their fear, makes their fear fee virtuous, and these emotionally manipulated useful idiots are the reason Nazi’s were able to rise in the 1930’s. They would turn you in to the brown shirts without hesitation.</p>

<p>Yep, which is exactly why i am not lining up to get god knows what injected into me and why I am terrified that come this fall or whatever when they approve this shit for babies that he or some other well-meaning relative will have my son vaccinated without my consent (or call CPS on me for not doing so,) and whatever medical professional will just go along with it, because literally everybody is drinking the koolaid.

Well if you had doomer parents, it would be a life filled with fear, masks, no meaningful contact, and lots of toilet paper.

        <p>What "principle"? That people shouldn't make personal choices?  When masks were required I often left it on between stops so I wouldn't forget it at the next stop. Why would this bother anyone? </p>
<p>I honestly cannot think of any rational reason that this bothers some people so much. I am guessing it reminds them they might be wrong about all this denial and maybe they really have spread this  deadly illness.</p>

        <p>You are free to be a weirdo if you so choose. Wearing a mask alone in your car is the epitome of weird. If you forgot you had it on or something that is one thing but to be so filled with fear that you are purposely sitting alone in your car with a mask and gloves on, sorry you probably need some help.</p>

        <p>I mean for the most part I agree with you. It’s not like it infuriates me, I just notice it often. Best I can say is that I compare it to wearing a condom 24/7–I don’t go around trying to find people wearing condoms, but if I learned about someone doing it then I’d be confused as to why they’re doing it and probably make note of it in my mind. It’s not like it really affects my life, and it’s not like I go up to these people and bother them. I just notice and note it, and wonder why they do it. I think it’s safe to assume some people are like you (doing it for convenience/general forgetfulness) and some people are just extremely paranoid of the virus and they think it’s floating around them trying to infect them at every moment.</p>

It's like that scene from Monty Python, city officials are out with their wagons yelling at people to "Bring out your dead!".

Some people don’t read the information related to Covid deaths that are really not Covid deaths, but rather people who have the antibodies and died of other preexisting conditions.

<p>And how do you explain that somehow we all survived without masks before covid. Do you think contagious viruses didn’t exist? Do you honestly think covid is the MOST IMPORTANT DEADLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS that ever existed and now all of humanity must change and wear masks forever if you’re unvaccinated?</p>

<p>Today, Covid is the #1 cause of death in the US. Hopefully we somehow get to herd immunity and move in. We may need annual booster vaccines. We have the means to get out of this mess fairly quickly, or we can drag it out for years.  </p>

<p>Covid is NOT the number one killer in America.  Show me your source on that.  Even the CDC says the numbers were intentionally inflated by counting all deaths where the deceased had tested positive for ANTIBODIES.</p>

        <p>Some of us masked up and it was apparently very effective in stopping the flu. But even before that, CDC estimates 24K to 60 k, flu deaths, vs over 600k to date Covid deaths. How is his lie is still circulating?</p>

        <p>Do you know any people who want mandate the vax in real life? I don’t. So I wonder how many of these authoritarian control freaks are bots or trolls, &amp; obviously the media wants us to believe that’s the general consensus. Anything MSM pushes strongly, I’m inclined to believe the opposite is true, I.e. most vaxxed people are okay with our choice to remain unvaxxed.</p>

        <p>I wonder why they don't just let the super deadly grandma murdering virus just run it's course and wipe out everyone who doesn't get the vax?  I mean it's so super deadly isn't not getting vaccinated essentially suicide? And of course they got the vax so they are protected, right? I mean what would be the point in getting a vaccine if it didn't offer protection! That would just be silly!</p>

        <p>I don't have a history of heart disease, so not too worried about that.  I'm pretty sure everyone in my house already had covid anyway.  December 2019 all 5 of us (Myself, wife and three kids) all had a month long weird cold/flu hybrid, mostly coughing really but generally just didn't feel well.  We have all had colds and flu before, it wasn't quite like them.  A few months later covid was getting serious and we all figured that's what we had.  It actually makes sense, my wife works in a medical building and my job has me in several different houses every day and neither of us ever got sick after that, when really we would have been the most likely to get it.  Both of us were tested several times, always negative.  Assuming that's the case, our immune systems are working as advertised so no need to get a vaccination for something my body already figured out how to deal with.</p>

        <p>Be careful, the last I heard the vaccine provided longer immunity. But you've made your decision and that's your right and it's not up to me to judge. I am only here because there is some real dangerous BS being pedeled here (only vaccinated people get sick,  no one dies of Covid except fat, ,old,and sick people so why should we care., Vaccinations cause varients, and on  and on)  People need to decide for themselves, but based in real information, not BS.</p>

        <p>That is absolutely the right attitude to have, it's up to the individual and that's about it.  To be honest, up until both my stepfather and father in law were hospitalized with heart issues within a week of the second shot, I was leaning towards getting it.  They did both have preexisting heart issues, but it just made me step back and think about the risk vs reward, and I'm just going to wait it out. If it means there are things I can't do then so be it, I'm just not willing to roll the dice until more long term data is out there.</p>

<p>Any company that mandates vaccinations is not a company that cares about your husband's health. After all, if he gets the vaccine and then has major health problems because of it, they have no liability. They would probably fire him too, due to his inability to do his job.</p>

        <p>We are in the same boat! Majority of the people at his job are vaccinated. A few months ago his company put out a survey asking people if they are vaccinated, will they be getting the vaccine, or wont be getting the vaccine. It was an anonymous survey and they sent the results of the survey to all employees. Only 38 people said they would not get vaccinated, out of hundreds of employees.</p>

        <p>My kids school board wants it to be mandatory. Their board meeting the president said parents need to “do the right thing” so it doesn’t negatively impact their students grades when they have to be quarantined for 2 weeks every time they come in contact with someone with covid. They have the choice to offer Elearning for kids quarantining since they will have it set up anyways for kids who cannot get the shot, but they decided against it just to pressure parents</p>

        <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but a vaccination doesn't do anything to prevent that you may still contract the virus and be able to spread it? From  my understanding, the only benefit to taking the vaccine is that it introduces covid into your system at a level that you can safely immunize against it. Is there another benefit to the vaccine that I'm  missing?</p>

        <p>I have a 2 year old. She can't get the vaccine yet because they haven't done enough research in it to deem it safe for children under 12. You seem to be afraid of unknown side effects of the vaccine. I am more concerned about the unknown side effects of the virus. I see the virus as a more concrete threat than the vaccine, seeing how it's killed hundreds of thousands of people already.</p>

        <p>If you get the vaccine, you're safe.  You won't be hospitalized and you won't die from COVID.  You are also much much less likely to spread COVID, and you won't be a petri  dish for any mutations that COVID could take to become even more deadly.  That's the biggest one that I don't get how people are opposed to.  Sure,  you might be young and healthy, but a virus just needs time to mutate.  Why give it that time in your body?  I'm not saying everyone who is unvaccinated will get COVID (although, anecdotally, just about everyone I know who hasn't been vaccinated did get sick), but you run the risk of getting sick and getting others sick who may not be lucky.</p>

<p>I agree we don’t know all the side effects of the virus, &amp; they can be bad, but not as bad as the vax has been established to be. So the risk/benefit analysis is clear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, anything being pushed so aggressively by the govt &amp; globalist orgs especially in light of the above should set off major alarm bells.</p>

        <p>Well said.</p>
<p>And honestly, I just don't understand it.</p>
<p>I have had zero fear of getting Covid from March last year when all this insanity kicked off. Don't wear masks, will never get vaccinated. </p>
<p>I am under 60, have very good health, never get sick and, if I did contract Covid, would expect minimal or no symptoms. Just like when I got the flu about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, half the people I know that did get vaccinated are still scuttling around in masks, obsessively washing their hands, social distancing 10 feet away from me and furious that people like me won't be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe it's the news media and social media stirring up the shit that is the most to blame for this. Governments are just reacting to their idiot citizens' panic and hysteria.</p>

        <p>That's funny, the first 2 of my co-workers who got vaccinated both tested positive for Covid 2 weeks later and spread it around. But of course my employer demands we wear masks and social distance if we are not vaccinated. So I just identify as vaxxed now.</p>

        <p>This. Everyone around me, all the people I know, myself and family etc all mysteriously got sick this month (unheard of as it is summer rn), which coincides with when all these people have been getting their jabs. And all the jabbed were sick too with the flu, which is what they spread to others who hadn't got the jab. Bastards.</p>

        <p>It’s really about everyone and not just you.  I know this will fall on deaf ears in this fucking sub, but it’s really about heard immunity so others don’t get really sick as well.  Most icu departments of hospitals would not be able to supply everyone with oxygen and healthcare professionals would essentially decide if your parents or grandparents die.</p>

        <p>But do you have family or friends or even colleagues that aren't perfectly healthy, are obese, or are elderly? Because with the vaccine you'd be protecting them as well. I know you're beyond being rational, but come on. Just because you believe it won't affect you, first of all doesn't mean you won't get it (and even healthy people have died from it), and second of all it doesn't mean you won't spread it to other people.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say it’s not easily transmissible. But I’m young and healthy and Covid does not pose a serious threat to me. This data is easy to find. When presented with data that contradicts your fearmongering, you doomers always refuse to accept it, so do your own homework. It’s been a year and a half - it’s time to stop blindly trusting the TV man and do a little research on your own.</p>
<p>Some <em>physically</em> healthy people wear masks to virtue signal and/or show their obedience. Whether or not they’re <em>mentally</em> healthy is up for debate. </p>
<p>But you’re not preventing the spread with your cloth/surgical mask. Just read the box… it literally says it doesn’t protect against Covid. </p>

        <p>Okay chief, let’s break this down to a level that even your elementary school level comprehension can understand. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7">Here</a> is a scholarly article, resources and funding being publicly available at the bottom for sourcing so your goofy ass can see it’s not paid for by some big corporation, that shows how wearing even a surgical mask prevents the transmission of airborne particles to a decent degree. More than enough to conclude that the reduction of these airborn particles equates to a tangible reduction in transmission of virus laden aerosols and droplets. </p>
<p>Now a non-insane human then wears this mask, even if healthy, to prevent the spread of not just COVID but any virus that relies in airborne transmission; the flu and the common cold are easy examples of this both with proven and unbiased data showcasing a decrease in cases among subjects that wore a surgical or N95 mask (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0248099">here again is a resource regarding this, broken down to easily digestible pieces of info</a>) While you and I can fight this off easily, the 67 year old who has to stop at CVS for their meds and touches the same door handle as you cannot. You’re not wearing it to save yourself, you’re wearing it to prevent becoming a spreader to others. Difficult concept but try to stay on track here. </p>
<p>The fact that the only lame excuse you can come up with is “I won’t source my data and this is about obedience” shows you have the intellectual level of a toddler with Down syndrome, but at least they can comprehend simple facts when presented to them so even that may be a bit generous. Keep this mantra going though, I’m sure I’d need an echo chamber too if i were coping with my daily mental gymnastics of realizing 99% of the world thinks I’m a knuckle dragging clown. </p>
<p>Have a good one chief.</p>

        <p>No.  The statistics clearly and obviously show that the human species does <em>not</em> expect a bad outcome from an infection of SARS-COV-2.  So it's obviously <em>not</em> a "safety" issue.</p>
<p>For the few people that seek hospitalization, or smaller still portion of those that die, it's a personal, individual health issue.</p>
<p>Please stop spreading dangerous and potentially deadly misinformation.</p>
<p>Since you're so confused about something so basic and simple as the distinction between a "safety" issue and a health issue, you could start to think about what other simple basic things you're wrong about, and what things that are more complex that you are also wrong about.</p>

<p>You can try using semantics to confuse yourself into believing that we all didn't just go through a pandemic, but it won't change reality.  Hundreds of thousands of people died from COVID 19.  Millions got sick.  We now have a vaccine.  Get it.</p>

        <p>So your bottom line is that you don't care if you toss words around as if words have no meaning or implications.</p>
<p>All you really care about is people shooting up a few hits of some shit that there's absolutely no scientific evidence of a necessity for.</p>
<p>&rt;There's nothing dangerous or deadly about getting the vaccine. If you get the vaccine, you're safe from hospitalization and death from COVID 19.</p>
<p>That's what you say, but that's not what happens out here in the real world.</p>

        <p>Understand that all the normal traditional ways of living (family, strong community, religion etc...) that moored people since forever have been on the wane for quite sometime, so it's best to think of this as like a new religion than anything else.

        <p>Yep. People like to think that religion is antiquated, and that they’re better than past peoples. When in reality, if you participate in society at all you have faith. </p>
<p>What I hate seeing nowadays is people conflating ideas with institutions. Don’t agree with the Catholic Church preying on boys? That means that you need to hate all Christians forever. 
Do you believe in the scientific method? Better start worshipping our medical institutions and bureaucrat-spokesmen like heroes or you hate science.</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm sure there are one or two people who literally can't get vaccinated that could benefit from it but literally anything could kill them if they're that immunocomprised and we shouldn't have to reshape society and decimate the economy just to accomodate them.</p>
<p>I feel this is an important point. It was never the case before that we shaped our entire society around the very weakest and frail, nor should it be now. Nothing has really changed in that regard that warrants a different level of precaution and consideration. Some support facilities, for sure, but <em>definitely not at the expense of absolutely everybody else</em>.</p>

        <p>Yep, totally insane to me. Millions of people die of tuberculosis every year, and that has a safe and well understood vaccine. If you're concerned about human life, you should be lobbying governments to support programs for TB vaccination as you would save exponentially more lives per dollar spent. But those people are brown so the typical pro-lockdown left wing nut won't care about them. All they want is to virtue signal and pretend to have some power for the first time in their lives</p>

You think it's some game, or survival of the fittest neo-nazi bullshit. If the virus had clear symptoms right away and only affected those who chose to live their life carelessly, then I wouldn't care. It's your life. But it affects so many people around you without you knowing it. Taking basic precautions to help your fellow man, I had thought we were evolved enough as a species to do this right. But I was wrong. We are awful to each other.</p>

        <p>It's true today a fully vaccinated co worker told me he's super excited to go around un masked now that he's been "double vaxxed" he said with much glee. I said I've been doing that the whole time. He then said I'm why covid has lasted so long and that if people like me don't get vaccines then we will wear masks forever. To which I said I repeated I haven't been wearing masks at all... he call me an idiot.</p>

        <p>It's like my vaxxed co-worker who asked me a few weeks ago when I was getting vaccinated. I said I had covid last year, I'm naturally vaccinated so I'm good. He said "well you should still get vaccinated, they don't know how long the immunity is good for". I told him I'm going to roll the dice with my natural antibodies.</p>

        <p>Maybe more generally than not. But...I do want to gently remind folks that all is not as it appears to be sometimes. </p>
<p>For instance, neither hubby or I are vaccinated. This past weekend we both got sick. Tested for Covid - negative. Got something else going on. Common cold? RSV?  Not sure. But I am coughing so when I step into the grocery store, I mask up so I won't infect others with whatever bug I caught.</p>

        <p>I got banned from only one - r/CovidVaccinated.  And I thought I handled myself very well. But then I found out, that doesn't matter. If you are a member of r/NoNewNornal, you automatically get banned from certain other communities.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's hypochondria, I hate to nitpick but hypochondria usually involves having psychosomatic symptoms (aka my brain makes me feel sick when I'm not because it fucking hates me or something IDK) and you assume the worst, that your stomach cramp is a sign of cancer that's about to metastasize or something.</p>
<p>Being a hypochondriac is great. I get sick extremely frequently, but I'm never ACTUALLY sick so I don't get to miss work or school. It's the best of both worlds!</p>

        <p>I got the J&amp;J jab and I'm not scared of the virus. But I wasn't in the first place. I also don't give two shits if the person next to me gets the vaccination or not, nor do I think the case has been remotely made that it should be injected into anyone under 30 (much less children). </p>
<p>The scariest thing to me is authoritarian insanity, even accounting for potential side effects of the vaccine. The latter will be a temporary social health issue. The former will be a long term social disaster.</p>

        <p>Its classic buyers remorse, you see buyers remorse ends when you take delivery of a product, you only have this feeling up to the point you take ownership because at that point you justify to yourself why it was the right decision. They were just as nervous as the rest of us but once they have taken "delivery" human nature will force them into believing they made the right choice unless mass failure happens. See now they are afraid someone WILL convince them it was  bad idea.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't be opposed to keeping these losers on the margins of society. After all, they had a huge hand in enabling the government to act like this, and are part of why most countries still haven't gotten over their fear yet. Fuck em.</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity today, I watched an MSNBC report on vaccines, on youtube.  The report turned into a real rant about how anti-vaxxers are endangering people.</p>
<p>The youtube comments were filled with many people suggesting that if the bad republicans don't want the vaccine then it is OK for them to die from COVID19.  The comments were not necessarily meanly written, really seemed calm in expressing a desire for people to be killed.</p>
<p>And I'm scratching my head as I understand there aren't so many deaths anymore as doctor's have learned how to properly treat the infection early with generally good outcomes.</p>
<p>I know people are still becoming sick from COVID19, I saw a facebook post to our neighborhood group yesterday, a whole family sick with it.  She was asking for advice on food delivery that isn't junk food.</p>

        <p>I got the jab x2. Either case I’m not afraid of covid and it’s astounding how many people that got vaccinated still want to wear a mask for “safety”. At one point will they realize that the world is a dangerous place and people just have to take risks little or big and move on, it’s ridiculous.</p>

        <p>South Floridan here. it's been awhile since we all took our masks off down here. I can finally go to stores without people looking at you. I work on south beach for a hotel right on the beach and no one here has a mask. either most are vaccinated but mainly no one really cares who is or who isn't down here. I'm working the front desk right now breathing freely hoping the rest of the country can be like this. I'm sure the people traveling down here are okay with us not wearing masks.  I'm not vaccinated, shit I haven't even taken a covid test.</p>

In my state, the masked are obvious and unique, but not harassed or ostracized, don’t know how they feel personally, but I don’t judge.

        <p>Wife is a nurse, made the appointment, and away I went, we did it together. I really didn’t give it much thought, still don’t, and I don’t walk around with a sticker or card or anything, nor do I announce it. I’ve had no adverse reactions, and it’s been 2 months. I don’t care if you take it or not, I don’t care if you wear a mask or not, and I defend the right to choose. I do like this sub for the information and news.</p>

        <p>Simple answer is heavy overlap between non-elderly rushing for the vaccines and hypochondriacs/hyper-political types. I think this is one of those things where there’s a really loud crazy minority that wants to be afraid despite taking the most prevention measures. Most people are either indifferent to the vaccine or completely ditched the mask/distancing rules once they got it.</p>

        <p>I’m vaccinated but only because I’m in the health field. I absolutely think that people should have the choice to get vaccinated or not. That is up to the individual. That stated, the mask mandate is ridiculous. I truly feel that COVID is going to go the way of the Flu. Vaccines will become available yearly for the variants. Recommended for immuno-compromised and elderly.  </p>
<p>Edit: Just want to say….I love living a normal life while other people are hidden and afraid. The shopping is better, less crowded.</p>

        <p>Strains of the cold died out and became extinct while COVID-19 still spread under strict social distancing and sanitary measures. Scientists and doctors talk openly about how wildly and rapidly Covid-19 mutates (their specific concern are the large pockets of unvaccinated). I'm def no germaphobe, but I'm also not a reddit soapbox trying to belittle someone for being overly careful.<br>
Maybe before blaming someone for making it political, one should look in the mirror first.</p>

        <p>Idk I regularly clean and am vaccinated. Not scared really of a wave of death. Of the economic turbulence sure, but wiping out an era-reversing amount of western civilization? Highly doubtful, undoubtedly efforts should be taken to avoid it like enhancing or regulating one's hygiene better. If people weren't so dirty and careless in general, it wouldn't be alarming to hear "Hey, wash your hands a tad harder for awhile and maintain some vigilance of those showing symptoms."</p>

        <p>As a fully vaccinated person, I'm not scared. I'm maskless now, but I never was scared of getting sick. I'm scared of not being able to work. Now, with the Delta Variant, I'm hearing vaxxed people are not only catching it but dying from it again. I'm putting my mask back on. A lot of people likely will never take them off. "Normal" will never be what it was before. It will always be a little different.</p>

        <p>I get your point. I’m vaccinated but I really understand your point - now is the time we should be able to return to normalcy, as it seems quite safe at this point. </p>
<p>But there was a lot of trauma this past year. I had 2 neighbors die from covid, my uncle was hospitalized on a respirator for 8 days. The fear was real for many people. Trauma doesn’t just go away immediately, and people may take longer to get back to normal.</p>

        <p>One obvious reason, and I don’t disagree with therapy but I wouldn’t put it as dickishly as you did, could be that, like me, they lost a loved one to the disease. Unresolved grief, etc. another reason could be that the variants concern them, they don’t for me, but it’s not an unreasonable concern. Personally I have demasked, I do still sanitizer after, for example, using gas pump because I don’t think it’s a bad practice at all. Something that’s an embraced new normal for me. </p>
<p>I know I won’t convince you but this vaccine was not experimental, untested, and yes it came quick but that’s because it had to but that does not equate “rushed”. </p>
<p>I never found myself getting angry at people who didn’t mask, and I don’t know why anyone would get mad at people who do. It’s not a bad practice to get into doing if you feel unwell, obviously people may take that a bit far but in general it’s not bad</p>

        <p>I respect you not wanting to get the vaccine. You’re hardly the minority there. I will tell you though, I’m not a fan of name calling. I think that’s a low blow regardless if you’re ranting.</p>
<p>That being said I’m genuinely curious. Who is trying to force you to get the vaccine against your will? Are you being detained at a facility where the condition for release is you must get vaccinated? Are armed security guards holding you hostage at your home until you receive it? Is it now mandatory or you will lose your job? Your verbiage doesn’t name a specific person/organization that “needs a lesson in consent” so I’m confused as to who this rant is really directed at.</p>

        <p>&rt;opted out and that's their choice. </p>
<p>The problem with this is that "their choice" carries detrimental effects for others. It is a choice that extends beyond the individual making it. Being unvaccinated allows the virus to spread to where it can mutate. That is bad.</p>
<p>&rt;They're as protected as you are</p>
<p>No they are not. Unvaccinated, otherwise healthy people are dying due to variant strands of COVID, whereas vaccinated individuals are not. That is bad for those who are unvaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt;you've resolved to make everyone miserable</p>
<p>Everyone's misery comes from unvaccinated people prolonging the reopening process by refusing to get a safe, sensible vaccine and being walking variant factories. I hope they are not surprised if mask mandates and lockdowns come back because of the Delta spread they are contributing towards.</p>
<p>&rt;I happen to think that taking an untested, experimental, rushed vaccine is quite a big deal </p>
<p>The vaccine is none of of those things. Maybe one could get away saying this in spring 2020, but not anymore. Millions of shots have been given with barely a blip of an issue. </p>
<p>&rt;I wouldn't force you to do anything at the end of the day</p>
<p>Not so fast. By refusing the vaccine you are indirectly forcing others to potentially get infected by asymptomatic carriers. That's why it is a <em>public</em> health crisis and not a <em>private</em> health crisis. Refusing the vaccine has an objective, detrimental effect on others. </p>
<p>&rt;thrust a needle and squirt a foreign substance into my arm against my will... My body, my choice. You all need lessons on consent.</p>
<p>Again, your choice has detrimental effects on others. People have a right to go out into public without fear of a potentially lethal virus. An individual's selfishness does not override this. Refusing to get vaccinated prolongs our collective recovery and helps no one.</p>
<p>If you are tired of hearing about and dealing with COVID, welcome to the club. The best thing we all can do to finally put this all behind us is get vaccinated. It's that simple.</p>

        <p>The vaccine makes you immune to the symptoms, but you can still potentially carry the virus and be contagious. The point is that it would die out if enough people are vaccinated. And even so, with the amount of unvaccinated people, it's still mutating, and not every vaccine will protect as well against every variation. </p>
<p>Why do you care if people still wear masks or use hand sanitizer? It just means you're less likely to catch a cold.</p>

        <p>Well, being vaccinated does not mean you won't get sick and it also does not mean you won't make other people sick (specially those who have not been vaccinated, like some young kids). The vaccine also may last only a few months or more (it depends on the vaccine of course, and I don't know if it has been officially determined how long the inmunity lasts for each one, but mine was said to be about 6 months more or les).  </p>
<p>Being vaccinated only means that your body will be more effective at targeting the virus, making you have less symptoms, but won't prevent it from ever entering your body</p>

        <p>That's understandable, but I guess it's the best option to avoid dying because of it. The idea behind vaccinating + protecting yourself is to fulfill the last guard that's needed, and it's to avoid getting the virus into your system in the first place. Using a mask will prevent the most it can from the airborne virus, but cleaning stuff is understandably a bit unnecessary, because it has been proven that once it sticks to a surface, it's very unlikely to come up again into the air. Washing your hands, using a mask and vaccinating is the best alternative to avoid getting covid (the vaccine is the most useful)</p>

        <p>that's fine if you think that, and honestly I understand your feeling of not caring if you ever get or not covid, but there is a slight issue that may come up if you get sick (which is likely to kill you or permanently damage your lungs and other organs, unless you are vaccinated or is asymptomatic) that is making other people sick and possibly getting them killed. I have an immunodeficiency disease, which means that if I ever get covid, it's very likely I will have a very hard time recovering. So another important factor is the people around you, like your family (and strangers if you care enough).</p>
<p>edit: 
may I ask which risks are involved with the vaccine? i'm pretty sure those are hundreds of times less likely to happen and even less severe in comparison to the risks of getting covid</p>

        <p>You got an untested, experimental drug injected into you that the makers would only give you if they were absolved from any consciences if you have any adverse side effects, for maybe six months of protection from a virus with less than a 1% lethality rate that you could catch and spread? Seems pretty fucking stupid.</p>

        <p>I dont know from where you took that percentage, but I agree it's generally small right now.</p>
<p>It's not an untested nor experimental drug, even considering Pfizer which is treated like a new drug when it's not. mRNA vaccines have existed for a long time (soon they might release an HIV vaccine that has been made a long time ago), but only because of the pandemic have health organizations agreed to allowed them, because they are considered unethical for intercepting with our dna (which it doesn't really, it's not permanent either) or organic proceses.</p>
<p>Also, the effects of the vaccine are proportionally zero in comparison to the virus, both in quantity and severity.</p>
<p>Maybe 6 months, maybe more, it doesn't matter. Like I said earlier, I agree that mortality rate is small, but that doesn't include secondary effects after recovery. </p>
<p>In the end, it's ok if some people don't vaccinate for a variety of reasons, eventually we'll all happen to become better at attacking the virus</p>

        <p>So this is just gonna get flamed and downvoted to oblivion but i cant help myself. No matter what you believe about the source or cause of the virus 15% more people died in 2020 than the previous year. If that wasnt the covid virus than what was it? Id like to know so i can avoid whatever it was. Note that the vaccine wasn't widely available during 2020 so it wasnt that either.</p>
<p>In 2020, approximately 3,358,814 deaths occurred in the United States (Table). The age-adjusted rate was 828.7 deaths per 100,000 population, an increase of 15.9% from 715.2 in 2019.Apr 9, 2021</p>

        <p>And what was the source of this graph? Because anyone can make a graph. All i require is actual numbers and sources. Im 100% open to changing my mind as long as data is provided. My data comes from reputable sources and is backed up by information that you can find and corroborate yourself if you put in the effort. Deaths jumped 15% last year. What changed between 2019 and 2020? The only major factor is covid-19. As covid-19 was a new virus that had no history of infecting humans we had no basis to determine how bad it would be. Would it be like SARS and not become a  pandemic? Or would it be like the Influenza pandemic of 1918(Spanish Flu)? The only safe way to handle not knowing is to assume the worst. It turned out to be somewhere in the middle but i repeat WE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER IT WOULD KILL THE ENTIRE WORLD OR NOT!!!!!!!! We know how bad flu tends to be because we have literal centuries of it infecting humans and as a result only people who survived influenza had descendants. This leads to modern humans having an inbuilt resistance to influenza. We as a species have no inbuilt resistance to COVID</p>

        <p>First off COVID isn’t new. We’ve known all about it since the 60s. And deaths haven’t changed much. It’s still hovering around 7.5, just like it has been for the past decade.</p>

        <p>You are semi-correct. We knew about coronaviruses which covid is a type of. <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/a-brief-history-of-human-coronaviruses-67600">https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/a-brief-history-of-human-coronaviruses-67600</a>. The issue is that covid19 was much more transmissible and infected the whole world. The spanish flu was just a variant of influenza and it killed millions. If covid19 had been as deadly as spanish flu, with the spread that it had , modern society would have been in real trouble. The point is that we couldn't know how bad it would be and we should err on the side of preventing millions of deaths. I totally agree that once the death rate was determined and vaccines were developed that we can open up. I'm in Florida and vaccinated and we don't wear masks anymore. The key thing is VACCINATED.</p>

        <p>Where did you get those stats from, and has there ever been a time previously where deaths were higher than the previous year?</p>
<p>Pretty sure it's normal to have higher deaths each year as the population also rises.... more aged people = more possible deaths.</p>

        <p>Its per capita death rate. It automatically takes increased population into account. And you are right the death rate changes each year. The issue is by how much. As you can see its usually smaller than a percent.</p>
<p>Key findings. Life expectancy for the U.S. population declined to 78.6 years in <strong>2017</strong>. The age-adjusted death rate increased by <strong>0.4% from 728.8 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2016 to 731.9 in 2017.Nov 29,</strong> 2018https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db328.htm#:\~:text=Key%20findings,-Data%20from%20the&amp;text=Life%20expectancy%20for%20the%20U.S.,2016%20to%20731.9%20in%202017.</p>
<p>Life expectancy for the U.S. population in 2016 was 78.6 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2015. The age-adjusted death rate decreased by 0.6% from 733.1 deaths per 100,000 standard population in 2015 to 728.8 in 2016.</p>

        <p>fearmongering ?<br>
placebo/nocebo.<br>
everyone wearing masks.<br>
hospitals not treating people and canceling stuff for cancer patients.<br>
depression and bad health resulting from the lockdowns.<br>
there is even a study that shows that over 2/3 of excess mortality isn't covid related, besides, the excess mortality was only for a few months, the year overall don't have any unusual excess and is even under what is normal in many countries.</p>
<p>for every country that had excess mortality you can find one that had sub mortality.</p>
<p>but don't underhestimate how keeping to tell people that they are gonna die and trying to put them in a constent state of fear, will increase the amount of people that die.</p>
<p>anyway, there is covid, but even if there wasn't an actual virus you could explain that "excess" mortality which is in the error margins for the year overal anyway.</p>
<p>also, we had lower mortality than usual over the last few years, and if you look the graph, there was low mortality after the spike too, so at best it killed off people that were already gonna die later in the year.</p>

        <p>That’s likely true. I don’t even have an opinion on the vaccine, it’s just hilarious that OP is claiming that others need therapy when they so clearly need it.</p>

        <p>“If you truly trust the Science and the vaccine then you should be more than comfortable returning to normal. If not, why?“</p>
<p>Well that is true unless you understand that the vaccine was never designed to eliminate the virus. It was designed for people to less severe symptoms, to the point where most people won’t even recognize them as symptoms.</p>

        <p>And if you take the shot because you want less severe symptoms then that's your prerogative.  I personally, would rather not get the shot since most people don't have any symptoms at all.</p>

        <p>Equally though, that level of fear displays a level of paranoia above anything pre-2020. I don't know anyone willing to give up their rights and freedoms because they might get Measles post-vaccination, for instance.</p>
