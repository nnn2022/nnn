        <p>Science is not a body of knowledge. Science is a set of tools and practices used to discover or update a body of knowledge.</p>
<p>These tools and practices have been continuously refined and tested over the centuries. If you want to question the validity of those tools and practices, you can't, not because you're not allowed to, but because you're arguing with centuries worth of examples of how effective science is. Everything from the synthesis of plastic to the development of the internet was discovered and developed using scientific methods, and unless you're being disingenuous you can't argue with results. </p>
<p>If you're questioning the results you're more than welcome to. Questioning is one of the key practices that allows scientifically acquired knowledge to advance and be refined. But if you're not using the scientific method in your investigation, you're not going to be taken seriously, because again, you can't argue with such a means tested method.</p>
<p>And if you're questioning the results regarding COVID, using science, and not engaging in deceit, you'll find that masks are advisable, lockdowns can be handled poorly but are better than nothing, and the end of these precautions will come once enough people are vaccinated against COVID.</p>

        <p>Of course, there are always people who go against the majority, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a scientific consensus about Covid being real and masks being useful in stopping it.</p>

<p>It's been a year I don't know anyone who had died of covid or had to be hospitalised except my aunt that is a doomer like you, she took all precautions and still ended up in the hospital. Notice that I live between north Italy and France and I know lots of people since Ive been in +25 countries. </p>
<p>Actually this is the year that I've heard the least people being ill. Maybe I heard 10 coughs total in the last year.</p>

<p>Significant burden of micro and macrovascular clot: PE, acute renal failure, hepatic injury.</p>
<p>Cytokine storm and severe inflammatory cascades: hence dex use and trials for tociluzimab. </p>
<p>Unusually high burden of myo and pericarditis.</p>

<p>Yes and your point is?</p>
<p>Just claiming you’re a doctor doesn’t suddenly invalidate someone’s else argument.</p>
<p>In fact, that’s become the problem. A lot of discussion gets shut down because people default to <em>argument from/to authority</em>, which is a fallacy.</p>
<p>That’s not to say expertise isn’t useful, but using it as way to door slam debate is foul play.</p>

        <p>The full quote is "I'm not a doomer, I'm a doctor" adressing the "my aunt was a doomer like you." Context is important. They weren't door-slamming, they were stating how they have their information. I agree that using authority to door-slam is bad, but that's not what I saw in their statement.</p>

        <p>I normally dont want to be offensive with people, but I'm feed up with with this shit. </p>
<p>Guess what, when this thing started I was in Paris, I had a dream job that involved travelling around the world and being surrounded of beautiful women. At the beginning of this I was scared I won't lie to you. I heard the French President saying that "we are at war" to get ready to see people death everywhere. I was going to the supermarket and I was forcing my girlfriend to desinfect every product beacuse I heard that in some surfaces the virus could survive two weeks. As time passed and I start talking to people around the whole world and I never saw any proof  of this war going on. I haven't seen a dead body I haven't heard any ambulance, I've been in hospitals in Paris and Chambéry (center of the epidemic) and I waited 5' minutes before they gave me assistance (I thought hospitals would be war zones but actually I saw less people than never and I've never ever waited for so little. </p>
<p>The fact that you defend the mask use makes me sick, you're a doctor and you can't see that wearing mask for extended periods of time is harmful? You ok with children wearing masks at school for +6 hours while there's no proof whatsoever of anything going on? You're depriving people from fresh air and you see nothing wrong? </p>
<p>If there would be a pandemic why are we even discussing about if there is one or not? If I would see that this is all around me I would be the first in wanting to get a vaccine, but guess what, you're new virus only exist in the TV and the believe of the brainwashed.</p>
<p>Masks work? So what about Sweden or Florida that has less cases than LA?</p>
<p>The only thing that covid has killed is common sense or whatever was left of it. </p>
<p>I don't know why you're in this group? Do you want people to believe in you beacuse your a doctor? Sorry but I still trust in common sense. </p>
<p>How do explain that there no more flu, pneumonia, bronquitis, colds etc? How comes that has been erradicated? How comes there's only vivid now even if you die in a motorcycle accident?</p>

        <p>First, you responded to the wrong person, I was defending the doctor but I am not one myself. Second, my dad has had pneumonia recently so I'm not sure where your source is for that, and people get colds and the flu pretty commonly, that's why there's "flu season" and "the common cold."</p>

        <p>They're low because of the precautions we're taking for covid. To stop the spread of the flu you wash your hands, cover your cough, and stay home when you're sick. Notice how we're doing all of those things for Covid-19?</p>

<p>Would mind actually to mention your concerns? So far to me you seem like a full on Doomer. I'm not a doctor and I don't deny the existence of covid 19 I say is the flu and other respiratorie illnessses rebranded. </p>
<p>&rt;Elective and planned activity is reduced, meaning outpatient and front of houses services will be quiet. You are not medical, you are not privy to inpatient activities and your perception from outside is basically meaningless. Our ITU doubled and we expanded our bed base by a third, but outpatients are empty and the ED not necessarily crammed.</p>
<p>Your patients have double it because before people wouldn't go to the doctor for a flu or something flu like. They know that you'll feel like shit for 3 days and eventually would pass. Now they hear In the TV that if they have a flu like symptoms they might die and that's why so have more people.</p>
<p>&rt;Why would you see any? People are dropping in the street, doesn't mean there are no deaths in hospital or at home. What an absurd basis for your beliefs</p>
<p>There are deaths every year, and I don't know anyone dying of covid out of the hundreds people I know all around the world almost anyone I speak als don't know anyone, all I hear is 80+ years old people dying from this, guess what before 2020 if you died after 80 you would even ask why people would die, you would say they died beacuse old, did you know that in England the media of covid deaths is 83 years old? While the life expectancy is 82?  Let alone laws of dying for other cause and goin as covid. </p>
<p>&rt;I actually haven't mentioned it at all. The is you projecting.</p>
<p>So what is your position with masks? </p>
<p>&rt;Because of the combination of extreme delusion and self-centredness of ppl like you. Also your absolute belief that only what you tangibly experience is real, even though you have limited experience and having nothing to do with healthcare and pandemic management. </p>
<p>I'm not celf centered you Doomer fuck, if I would have hear anyone affected from this I would be the first in being ok with the Nazi measurements and lives fuck up because of them. but since I know people all around the world and I live between Milan (neighbor of where the pandemic "started") and Chambéry France epicenter of the virus in France and besides from the TV and Dr doomers like you the virus is nowhere to be found. </p>
<p>&rt;Common sense is only really a thing if you have a basic grasp of conceptual knowledge, as you are fixated that your 'beliefs' are correct that subverts any notion of common sense. </p>
<p>So because your a doctor you have a basic grasp of conceptual knowledge? Or studied that somewhere else, why don't you do some choreography dances with your nurces in state of accusing me of not having grasp of conceptual knowledge? You don't know anything about me Dr Doomer.</p>
<p>&rt;There are all those things, the fact they are communicable infections but also less infective and or milder than COVID means that they either overshadowed by the more severe infection or relatively greater cut in spread. </p>
<p>Milder than covid? Allegedly 80% of covid are asymptomatic how can something be milder than that? Please I invite to google 0 cases of influenza recorded during 2020.</p>
<p>&rt;Well we have done plenty of death certificates for other things....</p>
<p>We? We who? Would you mind stating your name, country, city and name of the hospital you work? This way I can stop calling you Dr Doomer.</p>

        <p>Sure thing. Before 2020 if you would get flu symptoms you wouldn't go to hospital, you know that you would feel like shit for 3 to 5 days in general but not limited. Since the media now is portraying a killer new illness with flu symptoms, the sheep that gets the mildest symptoms now goes to the hospital. </p>

        <p>It's true that masks don't guarantee that you won't catch Covid, but it decreases the odds of it happening. If it was an 100% prevention rate, you literally wouldn't be able to breathe at all.</p>
<p>Masks also help prevent Covid from spreading to others if you have it. It's not just about protecting yourself.</p>

        <p>Any gases other than oxygen that the body inhales is usually expelled afterwards anyways. You do realize the atmosphere is mostly gases other than oxygen, one of which is carbon dioxide, right?  If the body never expelled any of that, we would, by your logic, get sick. Except we don't. There is no evidence to support that clean air is toxic, as far as I know.</p>

        <p>&rt; Denying reality</p>
<p>Like denying that people under 70 have a 99.9_% chance of surviving covid?</p>
<p>Like denying that masks haven't done shit?</p>
<p>Like denying that lockdowns have caused massive spikes in suicide, substance abuse, domestic abuse, undiagnosed/untreated illness?</p>
<p>Also the whole point of science is that you never take any claim as a certainty, which you pro mask, pro lockdowns crowd seem to do every time Lord Fauci speaks. You are supposed to question the hypothesis, and conduct research to prove/disprove it. You people don't question shit.</p>

        <p>&rt; refuse to accept the answers that people who studied science</p>
<p>Carl Sagan and many other scientists insisted that the burning oil wells in Kuwait during the 90's Gulf War would cause a mini-nuclear winter, so to speak.</p>
<p>He said dramatic action was needed to stem what was an oncoming pollution and starvation the worst the world had ever seen.</p>
<p>Years later, when it was more than obvious his predictions were flat out wrong, he wrote,</p>
<p>“Arguments from authority carry little weight – authorities have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.”</p>
<p>It's entirely possible for a non-lawyer to represent themselves. Will they suck at it? Almost certainly. Do they occasionally win out against experts? Yes, e.g., Robert Kearns, inventor of the windshield wiper always represented himself in court.</p>
