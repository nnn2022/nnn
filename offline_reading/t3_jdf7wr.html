    <strong>Covid and religion and it pisses me off</strong>
    <p><p>Bit of a religious ranting</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not very religious but I always enjoyed going to church.  I've not been going much recently because I normally went with other people from my choir, but since singing is still "evil" I've not seen the point. Singing in church is important to me. I don't like the digital zoom church. For me church means  community, and currently there is very little of that, so it's not a priority for me. </p>
<p>My mom went today though. There's like 30 people allowed in the church. She said that in order to go to communion you have to put on your mask to walk tot he priest. Receive the host, walk back and then once in your seat you take of your mask and eat the host. It sounded so bizarre. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My mom was like "well it's fine" but it really isnt and she doesnt get it. I'm not a super religious person, i'm not a religious scholar, I have faith and that's about it, but that just sounds like the wrong way to go to communion.  Isn't the whole point of church that you have faith in God and that he will provide for you and that he loves and cares for you? The whole shtick with "he will raise you up on eagles wings and you shall not bash your foot against a stone" because he looks after you? </p>
<p>This whole covid-mask panic seems like the opposite of "trust in god". If you trust God so little that you think he cannot protect you from basically a hopped-up coldvirus, then your faith in God is so tiny that you probably shouldnt even be in church. </p>
<p>No that I necessarily believe that "god is looking out for me and thats why i'm not worried about the scary virus" it's more that the virus is already not scary to me. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean what is this nonsense? It's encroaching on every detail of my life! </p>
<p>For fudge's sake there's a church in my country  that has seating for 2000 parishioners.  Over 200 people ( like way over 200, i think i heard 400 but i'm not sure) could sit there with 2 meters distance, which is more than the required 1,5 meters here. But churches are limited to 30 people now, no exceptions. And when they had mass with  distancing and masks but with around 300 people everyone freaked. And now the media is full on attacking that church. </p>
<p>It's all so arbitrary. I may not agree with the particular denomination that church follows, but in a building for 2000 people it's a whole different ballgame and they should not be held to these idiotic "30 people" rules. They should get to do their thing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm just pissed off about this, sorry if it's a bit too ranty</p></p>

        <p>I’m religious and am extremely close to leaving my church entirely over this. They’ve allowed one group to meet in person (the African American congregants, who go to a smaller building in an urban area). We have several campuses and they are only letting the one predominantly black campus meet in the main building, and the rest of us get zoom church. </p>
<p>In my opinion the church should be the last place to cower in fear. At this point, nearly eight months in, we know enough to bring back some semblance of normalcy. Church is also about fellowship, and seeing each other in person cannot be replaced by zoom calls and virtual sermons. In my opinion it’s the work of Satan trying to undermine the church, and they’re falling for it.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I wasn't raised a christian, I'm not a hard-core catholic. But I do believe and trust in god. And I'm seeing the way things are going right now and I don't like them. The way things like the communion are treated right now are outside anything even I could consider reasonable.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't particularly like ascribing just anything to "this is Satan omg" but in this case it does look a bit like it. It may not be the work of satan, but if we can no longer trust that god is keeping us safe from what is pretty much a virus without teeth, then how are we supposed to believe god can keep us safe from satan? Everyone is cowering in fear and submitting. What happened to standing proud in your faith? </p>
<p>I just get tired of this nonsense day in day out.</p>

        <p>I’m always hesitant to say something is the work of Satan as well, and in the past have had trouble truly  believing that part of Christian doctrine, since it seemed so...superstitious?  But now it seems very clear to me that someone or something is attacking our foundations and one of those is organized religion. It’s happening before our eyes and one only needs to look at the Hasidic community in nyc to see proof.</p>

        <p>It's odd that sects of Protestant Christianity that emphasize Revelation would be so placid about what's going on.  If anything in world events ever screamed Revelation 13:15-17, this would be it.</p>

        <p>I can relate. Local churches here are doing some ridiculous things, things they decided on their own, not mandates from the government. They have meetings only every other Sunday. At a baptism service, everyone is required to wear a mask but, at the luncheon afterward in the multi purpose room instead of the chapel, everyone is allowed to be mask free. 🤷‍♀️🤪 And nobody seems to see or care how ironic that is!</p>
<p>That said, I’m especially angry about the government making mandates for religious services. Religion is supposed to be an area more so than others, where the government has no business dictating.</p>

        <p>Truth be told if we hadn't kicked God out of America we wouldn't be in this mess.</p>
<p>When the government kicked God out of schools, people screeched "separation of church and state." Hypocritically, the State then wants to force churches to marry Sodomites and now restrict services over a phantom disease.</p>
<p>What the government wants is not church and state separation, but rather God and man separation, so as to fill the void and make themselves a god.</p>

        <p>I've been an atheist since I was six years old, but I feel your pain - a great source of community and fellowship has been taken from you.</p>
<p>It's just so wrong. I know we can't fix it right now, but how do we ensure this doesn't happen again when the next global panic kicks off?</p>
<p>I'm in the UK and thought no way would our society be taken over like this, with fear mongering and authoritarianism, but it was.</p>
<p>Even in the USA where many / most of this sub are from - a bastion of freedom, with an armed citizenry that is practically rabid about preventing government overreach - has ended up with similar restrictions. (No offence btw, I agree with you)</p>
<p>How do we stop the next generation suffering the same fate?</p>

        <p>Atheists like you give me some faith in humanity. Thank you for being so polite. </p>
<p>It is indeed mostly a sense of community I miss. Everyone, religious or not, is probably missing some sort of "community" right now, be it your friends, colleagues or whoever. I was hoping the community of my church would be strong enough to get me through, but even they are caving and cowering before the madness. </p>
<p>I'm in no way are zealot or a biblical scholar, but something about this is not the way Jesus would have wanted it. Something here is fishy. And I may not know my bible back to front or be able to recite whole verses, but i thought there were quite a few clues in the bible that would tell anyone who has even read it a little that the way things are not are not the way God intended. </p>

<p>Even my country of Then Netherlands, which was strong against masks until this month is now going to try and implement a mask mandate. I'm sorely disappointed in my country and will be paying much more attention this election cycle than i did 4 years ago and voting according to how i really feel, not what my family wants me to vote.</p>

        <p>There's a very solid reason that totalitarian governments are so gung-ho to crack down on the devout, from the Uighur Muslims to the Sudanese Christians, from the Catholics in British Ireland to the pretty much everybody in Northern Ireland, and basically all Manicheans absolutely everywhere: a person who's willing to acknowledge an authority higher than the government (or the Party) is a person you may not able to control with fear.  I personally don't attribute the current mess to grand conspiracies either profane or secular, but there's definitely a lot of small-scale conspiring going on around it.</p>

        <p>I haven't been to church since this mess began. But all this talk about "following the science" almost makes me think about where the Bible talks about "a science falsely so-called." I'm no religious scholar and honestly haven't felt much faith since this COVID mess, but that did come to my mind this week.</p>
<p>Also I'm confused as to how the Catholic church has handled this especially. They seem especially faithless in regard to how they're doing things. Of course that may have to do with where the church is. I live in Florida and the restrictions on churches were debated really early on and DeSantis put no restrictions on them. I can't believe places like CA won't even allow singing in a church or allow them to hold services indoors. It's really almost anti-Christ to me, seems like they're getting to be like China. And they KNOW it's bull crap, but they're doing this so their constituents will be happy.</p>

        <p>A true God wouldn't let any of this happen. Look around, there are many things to be grateful for on this wonderful earth, but the ways humans live and treat others is proof God is dead or never existed. Looking to the sky has never saved anyone from anything, being present on earth and fighting back physically will.</p>

        <p>Do not be afraid of that which can kill the body, but fear God who can kill your body and then throw you into hell.</p>
<p>God is going to reveal Himself soon. He is testing us to see who is faithful to Him and who is not. This life is merely a blip, and to be persecuted and tortured and even killed is to be counted worthy. The apostles cheered when they were flogged in Acts. </p>
<p>It's going to get much worse and God will save those who are His. Don't doubt too quickly now.</p>
