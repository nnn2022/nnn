    <strong>I am desperate to move-I need advice</strong>
    <p><p>I am 19 years old living in Southern California, the lockdown has destroyed my life entirely, and I am going to move out of the state.  I posted a while ago on how the lockdown was making me suicidal, and I got the idea to move from that post.</p>
<p>I was planning on moving to Rapid City, South Dakota with a close friend.  However, this would require my doomer parents allowing me to use “my” car to go there.  I use “my” in quotes because they pay for the insurance and I would not be surprised if they formally own it.  Last night, I had a mental breakdown, and I ended up telling my mother that I almost had a suicide attempt due to the lockdown policies in California and was planning on moving to South Dakota, and she stated she was very supportive.  I thought I was in the clear.</p>
<p>However, later that night she was expressing major reservations about the move, and I realized she likely just said she was supportive in my vulnerable mental state to make me feel better.  Her and my dad are going to talk about it, and my dad is incredibly strict and controlling, meaning it is very likely they will crack down, forbid me from moving and will threaten to not pay for my college and/or car, thus preventing the original move plan.  In addition, me telling my mother I was suicidal in order to try and help her understand why I was moving may end up with them trying to send me to some kind of mental hospital, which will unquestionably make the situation much, much worse.</p>
<p>If they decide to try and prevent me from moving at all costs, I have already decided to run away from home and live entirely independently.  I got to this line of thinking after weighing my options last night.  I considered committing suicide and leaving a note if my parents do not support the move, but then I remembered a simple but very profound comment on my earlier post.  If I am at the point where I am going to choose death over life and feel like I have nothing to live for, then I am basically free to do anything I want, with no reservations since I am free to do anything I want in my own life if the option of maintaining my current situation is death.  I then decided against harming myself at all, deciding that if my parents do decide to try and prevent me from living life as I please, then I am going to book a flight to a city far away and manage without a car.  Nothing will stop me from moving out of this state.  Nothing.  If my parents decide to cut off college funding and take away my car, then I will declare an extended leave of absence from college and I will take a flight to someplace and manage without a car.  I am leaving, and nobody and nothing will ever, ever stop that.</p>
<p>However, people of reddit, I need your help on deciding where in the United States to move to.  I was originally planning on moving to Rapid City, South Dakota, but it looks like it will be difficult and/or very inconvenient to manage here without a car.  I then looked into various parts of Florida and into Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  Sioux Falls looked good until I saw their recent mask mandate; in addition, I don’t know if I’d be able to get around with no car.  I looked into Miami, Florida, as if I were to run away I would highly likely be alone, and a large city would be ideal to meet new people and not feel incredibly isolated, as well as being great to live in without a car.  However, Miami is going to get a new mayor who is a far-leftist, and I read that it is arguably the strictest city in all of Florida for coronavirus restrictions.  I am unsure of where to move to, so I will list the 4 places I have narrowed it down to, with details on all of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rapid City, South Dakota
-This is where I was initially planning to move.  However, if my parents decide to crack down tremendously and take away the car I use, then it looks like moving here will likely not happen, as it seems to be difficult to manage here with no car at all.  In addition, I’ve heard recently that there will likely be a mask mandate with Sioux Falls passing one recently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sioux Falls, South Dakota
-This seemed like an ideal option as it is a relatively large city in a state with no lockdowns.  However, I don’t know if I could manage without a car, and the mask mandate here is also not a good thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miami/Miami-Dade County, Florida
-I was seriously considering running away to here the most, as it is a very large city in a state with a very anti-lockdown governor.  I could definitely manage without a car if I moved here, and the very large city was appealing to me as it’s what I’d prefer.  However, I’ve heard Miami is the absolute worst place for restrictions in Florida, and the far-leftist incoming mayor is definitely not going to help things.  This would be my ideal option if it weren’t for the mandates and strict government in this city.  If anybody living in Miami has info on how strict the government here actually is and how normal it is, please let me know.  Miami is still a big contender of where to run off to in spite of the problems, and I’d like to know how pro-lockdown/pro-covid restrictions this place really is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Florida Panhandle
-I was also considering running away to here as people say it is the area of Florida where life is entirely normal with absolutely no restrictions.  However, the main issue is I don’t know if I could manage without a car here, and I don’t know of any very large cities here that I am super enthusiastic about moving to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Florida and South Dakota look to be the only options, but where in Florida should I go to?  I’ve heard about some rich kids moving to Florida to party and go to clubs; I’m not interested in this sort of lifestyle, but which parts of Florida do these people move to?  I simply want to know where in the state there are few restrictions.</p>
<p>Again, all of these are contingency plans; the preferred course of action is to just stick with the original Rapid City plan, but if my parents decide to tighten their grip on me and threaten to take away my assets that they pay for(namely my car), then the original plan of road-tripping with my close friend to Rapid City is out the window.</p>
<p>Which place would offer a good contingency plan to move to in the event my original plan does not work out?</p></p>

        <p>You're an adult. Just fucking go in the middle of the night and figure the rest out later. I'd chose Florida bc the economy is good, plenty of jobs and it's warm. Check out Pensacola or Tampa. Stay away from the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Also, if you don't want to take the car, look into Amtrak one way tickets. </p>
<p>Keep in mind though, that your destination might be fun at first, but if you start having those thoughts again, please seek medical help.</p>

        <p>I also advocating dropping college for right now. You DO need a plan and a direction in life, but you do NOT need college. </p>
<p>Consider the trades - hvac, electrician especially. Or real estate... they require licensing and a bit of school (with electrician being the longest schooling I believe) but it’s nothing compared to a university. A lot of people you’ll meet in those industries are self starters and could be good for potential friendships as well. Network, network, network. It’s not what you know, it’s who you know. Feel free to PM me as well, especially once you decide where to land. I may know people :)</p>

        <p>The trades or the army. Lol. Both will make a man out of you and give you a skill set for later in life. </p>
<p>Personally, I say get into framing or concrete first. Then move to where you wanna be. As for the army, infantry for sure.</p>

        <p>Do you have any savings at all?  Find a used corolla for $3000 and that will get you by for a while.  You'll need another $1500 or $2000 for first month rent and deposit on an apartment.  Then once you find a job you'll be set.  SD is much cheaper than LA so what money you do have will go farther.</p>

        <p>Just a note about your usage of the expression "run away" (which suggests you might be stuck in an old mode of thinking): You're 19, so you're legally an adult.  If your parents call the police to try to bring you home, the response will be "Tough shit, you shouldn't have pissed your kid off so much that he left."  </p>
<p>Finances are the only leverage they have now so, as others have said, as long as you're able to provide for yourself or lean on your friend long enough to get going under your own power, you're golden.  Might not be glamorous, might not be the most fun, but there'll be a feeling of freedom and self-determination that's unlike anything else in the world.</p>

        <p>First things first: discover if the car is yours or not. This should be on the title of the car in the glovebox. Car insurance is $100-200/month and is doable if the car is yours. YOU have every right to insure your own property. Call up any insurance agent and tell them you want insurance. </p>
<p>Second, don’t have your parents pay for your college. Especially if they are controlling. It’s not worth it. It’s time to be your own person. </p>
<p>Beware that Miami is partially walkable, but it’s expensive. Very few American cities make it easy without a car and you will want one to maximize your agency. Does your friend have a car? Can you share for awhile till you can afford a beater? I would hit the ground working till you can afford a car and then regroup.</p>

        <p>And very much recommend Florida over SD. This is going to be harder than you think, but will likely be worth it. But you don’t need to launch into this adventure headlong into a -20 degree winter. People will be out and about in Florida in the winter and you can make connections faster. You can also head to SD this summer if Florida doesn’t suit you, but i would not start there if you can help it. </p>
<p>Going with a friend would be awesome - are they down with Florida instead? Don’t underestimate how much you will need a friend - either to take with you or to make once you land in your new spot. It will be lonely. Don’t give in to the darkness. Keep chugging, keep looking for quality people. </p>
<p>You can do this. Just look a little before you leap, then leap.</p>

        <p>One of the best advices I got was “the only independence is financial independence”. You said you’re in college, did you have a side job? Any savings? Could you sell your stuff? From those places I would choose Florida, but Tampa. Why exactly are your parents against the moving? What is their precise reason to be against it?</p>

        <p>What are your parents reservations about the move? Are they all covid related?</p>
<p>What kind of job would you be looking for? Is there anything you have learned in college so far that you could leverage to get a job that’s higher than minimum wage?</p>
<p>Is your friend moving to Rapid City or is your friend willing to move anywhere else with you?</p>

        <p>Sioux falls sucks, it is a major city however </p>
<p>Rapid city is meh, the only upside is it's proximity to the black hills - spearfish is where it's at </p>
<p>Florida - Miami is expensive, crowded and can be rough  , i just left that area and now in the Panhandle area, much cheaper and laid back</p>
