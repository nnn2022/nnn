    <strong>Get ready for the revisionist history where everyone claims to have been against Lockdowns from day one despite supporting them</strong>
    <p><p>Don’t let them forget how they advocated for the policies that destroyed the economy. How they made the snarky remarks about oh you just want the stock market open so millionaires or your greedy self can make more money. How they called you and others in similar scenarios selfish for being concerned about their own survival, how they dismissed the prospect of you going homeless as a trivial and silly matter. How they felt just fine with the idea of you and millions in the working class being forced to sacrifice everything so that they could be safe.</p>
<p>Don’t let them use that cop out of “Oh well I agreeed that the government should be paying you more but even though I knew they weren’t I still advocated for your business to shutdown.</p>
<p>I’ve been saving receipts because there will massive mental gymnastics and revisionist history that will pretend like everyone was anti lockdown the whole time and had the same concerns that we were vilified for. It goes beyond “just wanting an I told you so” these people are sheeple who will gladly trample on you and your rights the moment someone puts enough fear in their hearts. They believe that their fears gives them the right to govern and control others. </p>
<p>They’re content with the idea of fucking you over for their own comfort and safety. Never forget that and never let them forget it. Sure they “changed” their outlook on it now when it started to either inconvenience them or it’s not popular opinion anymore. If we forget then those same people will just turn around and act the same when the next unknown virus or bad flu season drops.  They need to understand that they were wrong why they were wrong not just slip by parroting and following the wave because it’s just more convienent because when that wave shifts they’ll be back to supporting that side. </p>
<p>It’s okay if you were pro lockdown before I know much of this group is converted  doomers that woke up but in your defense you guys own that it was wrong and your judgment was skewed rather than trying to hide it and pretend it wasn’t</p></p>

        <p>This whole thing was all about the control and the psychological warfare.  This 180 they will take will all be part of the gaslighting where they look you straight in the face and say </p>
<p>"what lockdowns, I think you are misremembering". </p>
<p>And you'll say no, I'll prove it it's right here on your Twitter feed, they will nod at Jack who will hit the delete button and look you in the face again and say </p>

        <p>This is literally already happening, the other day I had someone tell me the lockdown that just got announced here (in Ontario, Canada) was the first one we had here. Meanwhile we've been on and off lockdowns since fucking April. There's no limit to how much these people will try to gaslight you.</p>

        <p>A LOT of them do.</p>
<p>I was looking at the petitions website yesterday - where the public can petition the government to look into certain issues. There's a petition to remove all restrictions which has ~20,000 signatures. That was heartening until I realised there's a petition for more stringent lockdowns with ~200,000 signatures.</p>

        <p>This matters far more for politicians and other "thought leaders." They might say they were in favor of "smart lockdowns" or something else that implying that noncompliant constituents or people on the "other side" were to blame for the lockdown failure.</p>
<p>I'm willing to give a pass to friends and family who eventually come around. Also, I'll likely be able to talk to them enough about it to realize that they actually did change their minds!</p>

        <p>They’ll only sway it to follow popular opinion and sentiment. When everyone including the MSM starts to shit on the decision making of the lockdowns and the consequences of them they’ll ride the wagon.

        <p>I'm willing to re-negotiate friendships with people who were into lockdowns for a short period of time, but anyone who said they didn't care that I can't breathe in a real mask, nope. That means that anytime some other crisis comes along, they won't care if I can't breathe or am otherwise encumbered by asthma then, either. I might feel differently about the lockdowns if I had actually lost my job, but I was already working from home before the pandemic (self-employed). I feel for the people who have lost their jobs and businesses. I think about how bad I feel sometimes, and I have to think that those people would feel 10x worse.</p>

        <p>I've been called a liar, or selfish for wanting to leave my house bc I can't breathe in masks either. Last time I lost a friend over this stuff they were insisting women deliver babies in masks, then called me a liar ect. It's almost nice to know who my real friends are but there are so few left. Several websites have been ruined as well. It's scary knowing people literally don't care if I can breathe, and their opinion is considered what's politically correct somehow. It's crazy.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I can totally relate to all that. The people who don't care that others can't breathe seem to be the people who claim to be highly empathetic protectors of mental health, too, but that's obviously just a crock of crap to get attention on Bell Let's Talk Day or whatever. I literally just got called a selfish ignoramus by a guy on another sub because I prefer to wear a bandanna.</p>
