    <strong>Road changes to 'accommodate (anti)social distancing'</strong>
    <p><p>It's been obvious for a while that their intention is to normalise and make all of these dystopian measures permanent. Here we have evidence of them changing roads to 'help with social distancing.'  Why on earth would they change roads if this is meant to be temporary. </p>
<p>The cruelty of these people who are trying to force humans to live like this indefinitely is unbelievable. </p>

        <p>They’re treating us like emotionless androids. This next generation of young people has been thoroughly fucked over. </p>
<p>I want one of these government officials to read a documentary on serial killers. The one common denominator is that they all had fucked up isolated childhoods. If they keep normalizing this (anti)social distancing bullshit, the blood is on their hands.</p>

<p>I believe you've disagreed with me on this in the past, but this is all intentional. They are curating people to become docile, and emotionless, because it's easier to control people that way.</p>

        <p>I feel very sorry for anyone young now. I'm glad in some ways that I'm not super young, and that I did a lot of interesting and varied things in my youth. I sometimes wish I was older and at the end of my life, because those people lived through so many great eras where jobs were plentiful, you could buy a house on one salary, there wasn't as much overcrowding everywhere and life was, from my understanding anyway, mostly better. Whereas we have to suffer in this nightmarish dystopia. I really hope we can defeat them and get our freedom back. I cannot believe we are yet again in a fight for our freedom.</p>

        <p>Not surprising, the pro-lockdown people tend to be anti-car. Their anti-car proposals (more pedestrian space, dedicated bus lanes, etc. at the expense of parking spaces and traffic lanes) would not receive much traction outside the pandemic. </p>
<p>Their post-pandemic goal is to force people out of cars and onto the existing bus service. They have no plans to expand or otherwise make bus service more appealing.</p>

        <p>Yes, and electric self driving cars which have pre determined destinations too. I'm really not a fan of public transport, here they are often slow, dirty, overcrowded and they never go directly to where you want so you have to get say two buses to get to where you want, and it takes ages compared to a relatively short car journey. I love having a car for the freedom it gives me.</p>

        <p>Madness! </p>
<p>As I’ve been getting out and about IRL, I’ve been amazed to learn just how many people no longer support (or never supported) this insanity but aren’t sure what to do from here onward. I’m at a loss with that next step myself. Simply talking to people and sharing likeminded rants isn’t enough. :/</p>
