    <strong>Here's what I think will happen...</strong>
    <p><p>So we all heard what the clowns at the CDC said today, so there's no need to repeat the obvious. </p>
<p>Now here's my theory of how this is going to play out. They just lost their primary incentive for people to get vaccinated. If people still have to wear masks, then what's the point of getting vaccinated? There is none, so this little "backtrack" is going to come back and bite them in the ass.</p>
<p>Secondly, civil disobedience and free will are still a thing. The internet is in no way a reflection of real life whatsoever. Most people are fed up with wearing masks and simply won't wear them anymore, regardless of what the guidance is. In my opinion, the mandates won't be so heavily enforced since people really don't seem to care. No amount of propaganda, emotional appeal, or mandating is going to stop reasonable people from choosing for themselves. Compliance and enforcement are definitely going to plunge.</p>
<p>If governors reinstate mask mandates they'd be committing political suicide. I'm from NJ, and Murphy is up for reelection. He already has blood on his hands for saying the Bill of Rights is above his pay grade, and for all the nursing home deaths. If he pulls a stunt like this, it's going to be a lot harder for him to be reelected. </p>
<p>Lastly, the CDC has no authority to make something law. They are recommendations, simple as that. Recommendations are not laws. The CDC says you shouldn't eat raw cookie dough, but I bet all the mask lovers have eaten a shit ton of the stuff during lockdown. </p>
<p>I really think this nonsense is asinine and they're all shooting themselves in the foot. If they truly want people to get vaccinated then don't force vaccinated people to wear masks. I'm vaccinated myself and I could give less of a shit as to whether someone has their vaccine or not. It’s their life. Let the people choose.</p></p>

        <p>No. People sadly will still get them because of all the jobs that are beginning to require them. People will also wear masks if they are told to. I have never worn one, never will but I was always the only one without one. Everyone complies out of fear.</p>

        <p>I hope you are right, but I think there is money involved.  Money going to corrupt politicians from companies that profited heavily from lockdowns and masks.  These interests may want to eke out a bit more profit from this bullshit with one more round of COVID hysteria.  Add to that the possibility of another "Pandemic Relief Act" with plenty of pork.  If the "Public Health Emergency" goes away, they can't pass another bloated bill to bilk the taxpayer.</p>
<p>I agree it may come at a political cost, but if you are lame duck anyway, you will be wanting to get rich while you are still in office.</p>

        <p>I thought that about many things these past 2 years, now I'm just not expecting anything out of an average human. And they usually live up to the expectation. Now I'm just focused on moving out of the city and leaving the whole fiesta behind</p>

<p>That's why mayors and county supervisors will be mandating instead.</p>

        <p>I'm not concerned about any of that, its the mandated vaccines or else no job that gets me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not getting paid enough to die.  Its going to be rough.</p>
