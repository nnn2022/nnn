    <strong>Yesterday's protest against health pass in Lithuania — failed due to government-organized discreditation campaign</strong>
    <p><p>We had a massive protest against the health pass in Lithuania yesterday. People were trying to stop the government from enacting laws that would ban the unvaccinated from going to any stores larger than 1500 sq. meters, going in for non-urgent healthcare, no beauty salons, pools, movies, events, no home repair/construction services that take longer than 15 minutes, enact payment for tests.</p>
<p>The protest was peaceful until dark, and then we were suddenly overrun by strange individuals who were very aggressive. The police did nothing to stop these individuals, using them as an excuse to tear gas and smoke bomb everyone there (including women and children). </p>
<p>The mass media journalists all arrived together at the same time with the unknown actors and did everything to capture these bad apples on camera, using this to paint the protest as "violent" and "unreasonable". They also made no effort to film the police provoking and abusing people with excessive force, ignoring the dangerous individuals - even when the peaceful protestors were actively helping in arrest them and handing them over to the police.</p>
<p>The protest was disbanded using tear gas, force and mass arrests.</p>
<p>Today, the restriction bill was passed without any changes. </p>
<p>We are currently at a loss on what to do next - our only idea is to make the protest a lot more massive next time. </p>
<p>What can we do to protect ourselves from the government? Any thoughts on what has worked for protestors in other countries?</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to everyone in the world currently fighting the good fight - stay strong!</p></p>

<p>Some protests have appointed special "marshalls" to prevent disruption by agents provocateurs.</p>

        <p>The problem is, the policemen are brainless. There are hundreds of them and they don't have individual thinking - just loads of dangerous idiots with guns. Convince them to join your side and it's over for the mass murderers in the government.</p>
