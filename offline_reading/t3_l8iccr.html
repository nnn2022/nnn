    <strong>How to convince people of the reality of covid?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I have been trying to explain the reality of covid to my friends and family, but they outright dismiss it, and call me a "conspiracy theorist". I provide evidence of the great reset, plans for global communism, and explain how the government won't give up their new powers. In response I get meaningless phrases such as "trust the government" and "if you disobey, people will die". I even send them videos, such as the ones by Computing forever, which I personally found to be very informative. How can I get people to realise that they have been tricked, and how do I convince people of the government's plans? Thanks.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, if they still believe in that shit after they roll out Anal testing and triple masks… they are a lost cause buddy. The type Darwinism should’ve taken out a long time ago.</p>

        <p>I think the issue is that they simply don't know about this stuff. I tell them about it and they just don't believe me. They say "don't be rediculous" and "that won't happen". If they knew about it then they might be more open to the reality of it.</p>

        <p>If you’re still that brainwashed at this point, I no longer blame the media but I blame the public’s lack of common sense to begin with. Really? Anal swabs?</p>
<p>To try to convince them now is pretty moot, you’re shooting yourself in the foot and committing social suicide because you’ll just be labeled as a grandma killer. Even though the people perpetuating this bullshit have killed thousands of jobs, contributed to a mass increase in suicide and drug overdose deaths.</p>

        <p>Hey, props to you man, wish I could do the same. All my friends are unfortunately hardcore leftists that are even trying to put libertarians’ heads on a stake, so I have to shut my mouth if I don’t want to be a social pariah. Sucks but most of my gen has normalized the hivemind. They’ll learn the hard way.</p>
<p>And honestly, if this is the elite’s way of killing off all the idiots, I can’t really argue with their agenda. Even if that includes some friends and family.</p>

        <p>Most of my friends and family are the same, except my mum and dad, who are centre-left, and one of my friends, who is a mild conservative. One thing I am very confused about with my friend though, is that he doesn't believe in climate change, meaning he obviously thinks for himself and doesn't believe the government all the time, but he 100% trusts the government when it comes to covid. Maybe I could use that to convince him although he may be reluctant because his grandma died from covid, or should I say he was told that she died from covid.</p>

        <p>One tactic I have used with great success was asking how they felt about "weapons of mass destruction" and "The War On Terror".</p>
<p>Nearly everyone will say that was a sham, and a travesty.  Our government lied to us about weapons of mass destruction, most people will agree.</p>
<p>So why should we believe them now?</p>
<p>What did they gain from WMD?  Well, the military industrial complex of the US made literally billions.  Military companies lobbied the government to push legislation which translated into billions in profit.  News Media complied in lock step to maintain the delusion.  </p>
<p>Nearly everyone agrees this happened.  We all remember it.  Most people you speak to will be outraged by this.</p>
<p>So why do you believe them now?</p>
<p>Introduce the possibility of the Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry is the single biggest lobby group in the United States.  They out lobby the military by more than double.  On average, they spend over $400,000/year <em>per Congress member</em> lobbying the government.</p>
<p>Many of the politicians have ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Many of them have ties to Wall Street.</p>
<p>Amid all of this chaos, the stock market keeps going up?  You don't find that strange?  Nothing is going on here??</p>
<p>All these small businesses are closed.  But Walmart and Costco are open and operating with impunity.  You don't find anything strange about that?</p>
<p>I've found it's very difficult to turn someone in just one conversation.  It's more like drops in the bucket.  At some point they will realize the deception.  </p>
<p>I hope.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the incoming wall of text.</p>
<p>I think you're basically dealing with two groups. One group is comprised of fence sitters who may be buying into some of the rhetoric but not all. The other group is the one that has wholely accepted the rhetoric in it's entirety.</p>
<p>For the first group, you can have some form of rational discussion with them. I have found that it's best to find some sort of common ground, such as an extreme position that both of you would disagree with, and then work backwards from there to show how what we're dealing with now could lead us there. Keep it simple and step by step. I've noticed that if you throw a ton of facts and statistics, people are likely to discount those or focus on one specific one they can disprove. if anyone is interested in specific examples, let me know and I'll be happy to elaborate. </p>
<p>For the second group, you should read into how cults are formed and how they fall apart. </p>
<p>My own understanding is that if somebody is thoroughly indoctrinated into a cult, the only thing that can really break them out of it is some sort of tragedy that affects them personally. Let's say two siblings are in a cult together, and one of them dies. A shock like that would get them to start questioning things enough to possibly break free long enough to find mental help. But no amount of logic, reasoning, or convincing will likely help someone who is deep into the indoctrination. This is basically the kind of people we are dealing with. Until something about this affects them personally, I'm afraid not you nor I nor anyone else will be able to help. </p>
<p>So that's about it. <strong>Tldr:</strong> focus your energy on people who are on the fence at least about some of the measures, and don't waste your time on those who wholeheartedly believe the entire story.</p>

        <p>ultimately this is a spiritual battle we are fighting. if they aren't conscious / awake enough to understand the truth of whats going on, they will lose the battle and there's nothing we can do for them. the reality of covid is meant to lead people to understand the reality of our existence. the realm we are in is not what we believe at all, and is more of a power-generating prison system for human souls than anything. your job is not to convince these people you are right. your job is to trust that you have found the truth and make the best decision you can make whilst in your living body with the time you have left. if that means preparing for whats coming, leaving them all, or changing what you believe so you can remain friends with them...ultimately you have to decide where to go as right now you are in limbo. you already know what is the right thing, it is just hard to do the right thing because belief systems and confusion and fear get in the way. these are all programs meant to stop you from becoming your full potential, and they can/must be released from your matrix/field by you then you can move on freely as was always intended by the cosmos.</p>

        <p>The splitting of 2 Earths. People will choose either to vibrate at a level of fear, or a level of love and liberation. I’ve made a post or two about it. People here need to remember not to slip into fear, as that’s exactly what all this is about. The collective consciousness is fighting against the tide of the planetary ego death as we rise back towards the solar Christ consciousness and back towards integration of unity.</p>

        <p>The ceo of moderna literally said this virus can’t be cured. So this vax isn’t a vax in the best sense. It can’t stop the spread. It can’t stop you from getting it. It just lessens the symptoms if you get it. So if the person making who wants to make billions of it says this.. and the masses still think it’s a polio vaccine.. you can’t help them.</p>

        <p>The populace is easily gaslit and duped. Now I’m not downplaying police brutality but we had a guy with 3 times the lethal dose of fentanyl shoved up his ass and die in the hospital 90 minutes later and even gave a urine sample .. turned into a national movement with a gold casket and white dudes crying at his altar. Meanwhile no one knows who Elijah McClain is mostly. It’s not organic. Floyd was a tragedy but the response was controlled by the people who run this place. Covid is a virus but in Asian nations it was handled easily. Singapore and Vietnam are laughing at us. This isn’t synthetic. Cuomo killed people and got a best seller. It’s all bullshit.</p>

        <p>I wonder if we would. Right now Keith Gill a normal man and a few others have hedge funds by the balls. I’m rooting for him but if they seize and arrest him under whatever hidden law they choose.. what could I actually do? Now the exchanges are limiting crypto so people can’t make money. So we get no helpful stimulus so people learned to trade stocks and now that’s gonna get taken. They will use that to remove shareholders and replace with stakeholder just like they want at Davos.</p>

        <p>I'd start off slow.</p>
<p>If you jump right into the great reset you're going to lose them. Start off with the small inconsistencies in the narrative... Like the world health organization covering for China... The media in January of 2020 more concerned about xenophobia. Masks don't work..... Yes they do. Ask them why it's safe to go to Costco and not the beach. Point out how the media demonized the anti lockdown protesters while praising the BLM riots, show them that ridiculous statement by over 1000 scientists claiming that the BLM protests are more important than stopping covid. Point out the governor's that don't seem to be worried about disobeying their own lockdown orders.</p>
<p>Shit... I just rattled those of the top of my head. And I haven't even mentioned the vaccine yet. Those are real tangible things that can easily be verified by the same media that these people take as gospel.</p>
<p>Not that the more "conspiratorial" angles aren't important too, because they are. But if you want to win people over, let them get their toes wet before you throw them in the pool.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>"Why not lockdown the airports so new mutant strains stop coming in from other countries? </p>
<p>What about all the big businesses that remain open as well. "Super spreaders" like walmart, malls, best buy, costco, target, etc, etc?</p>

        <p>Many ways, but they have to be at least slightly receptive to the idea. Start with how the PCR test works (or doesn't). Or with how the deaths are counted (deaths with COVID = deaths FROM COVID). Show them the lack of correlations between masks and COVID cases, or lockdowns and COVID cases. https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/l8igrj/if_you_dont_think_the_way_we_think_you_are_less/gld3qsh/</p>

        <p>Me too. I'm very happy to say that i just managed to convince two people! I'm not sure if they agree with everything yet but they definitely understand some of the dangers. I think I'll still need to convince them of the great reset plot for global communism and the issue with the vaccines. But I don't think they disagree with me because they have better evidence, I think it is because they haven't been exposed to evidence.</p>

        <p>No, tencent is a Chinese company which basic owns shares in every company you can think of. From game developers, to engineering companies. They are essentially china's grip on the outside world and force companies to censor anything which opposes the goals of the CCP. They even own shares in reddit and other social media platforms.</p>
