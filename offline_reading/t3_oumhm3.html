    <strong>Potential censorship? Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix unexpectedly cancelled from one of the most popular French TV channels</strong>
    <p><p>So this might be a coincidence, but I thought it was worth mentioning with things going crazy in France lately.</p>
<p>For the past month or so, one of the main TV channels in France TF1 has been broadcasting Harry Potter every Thursday evening. They've done that many times in the past, (last time being in Spring 2020) and they have usually, as far as I can remember, broadcasted all 8 movies, once a week for 8 weeks.</p>
<p>After the fourth movie was aired last week, I thought of the fifth one, Order of the Phoenix, which deals with themes that are strangely reminiscent of what we're living through right now. Harry and Dumbledore are torn down (they're essentially treated as bad conspiracy theorists by the media, which everyone believes) because the Ministry refuses to admit the return of Voldemort. A tyranny is then put into place in Hogwarts with the government taking total control of the school.</p>
<p>So I wondered if this movie, which was supposed to air yesterday, was going to trigger some more people to think of the similarities between this story and all the craziness going on lately. And then I found out TF1 was not going to keep broadcasting the series. The Order of the Phoenix was cancelled without warning or an explanation, despite being in the lead over every other program in France every Thursday evening, with an audience of over 3 million viewers. (Link to an article: https://www.mouv.fr/cine-series/harry-potter-tf1-arrete-la-diffusion-en-plein-milieu-de-la-saga)</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm overthinking it and it was only a financial decision or something along those lines. But perhaps it's more. I don't have the answer. But I thought it was worth mentioning.</p></p>
