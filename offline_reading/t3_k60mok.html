    <strong>Censorship at /r/LockdownSkepticism is getting ridiculous</strong>
    <p><p>I just had a submission declined on /r/LockdownSkepticism, even though I folowed the rules one of the moderators explained to me today.</p>
<p><strong>The link I posted :</strong><a href="https://www.portugalresident.com/portuguese-judges-wont-be-disciplined-over-controversial-ruling-highlighting-doubts-over-covid-test-reliability/">https://www.portugalresident.com/portuguese-judges-wont-be-disciplined-over-controversial-ruling-highlighting-doubts-over-covid-test-reliability/</a></p>
<p><strong>Title of the article :</strong>"Portuguese judges “won’t be disciplined” over controversial ruling highlighting doubts over Covid test reliability"</p>
<p><strong>First paragraph of the article :</strong>"The two Portuguese judges whose 34-page ruling over a case of illegal confinement of German tourists in the Azores created ‘ructions’ for authorities’ ‘official narrative’ will not be ‘disciplined’ by their regulatory body."</p>
<p><strong>Title of the topic I submitted :</strong>"Two appeal court judges in Lisbon are at risk of being ‘disciplined’ for a 34-page ruling in which they queried the reliability of PCR tests"</p>
<p><strong>Reason my topic was declined :</strong>"Thank you for your submission. We will not be posting it in its current form because the verdict has already been reached. They weren't "disciplined"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, the reason the content was rejected was because I tried to stick close to the original title by using the term "disciplined". Note that no reason was given for why this term was considered inaccurate or how to correct this.</p>
<p>THIS kind of nonsense is why I usually don't post there.</p>
<p>FYI, here's a link to the topic itself : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/k5vpoj/two_appeal_court_judges_in_lisbon_are_at_risk_of/gehwgmd/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/k5vpoj/two_appeal_court_judges_in_lisbon_are_at_risk_of/gehwgmd/?context=3</a></p></p>

        <p>As I said, the reason the content was rejected was because I tried to stick close to the original title by using the term "disciplined"... even though sticking as close as possible to the original content was precisely what a moderator told me to do.</p>
<p>Also, note that no reason was given for why this term was considered inaccurate or how to correct this. The least thing they could have done, is suggest one or more possible ways to correct my submission.</p>

        <p>I don't know what you're on about. You posted an outdated news topic. The portugal court hearing is over. The mod pointed this out to you.</p>
<p>I don't know if you missed it or are making a show for nothing.</p>
