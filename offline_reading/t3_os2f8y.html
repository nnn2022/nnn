    <strong>A brief history of why college is expensive and we have a "student loan crisis."</strong>
    <p><p>I wasn't sure where to post this, but I was hoping to make sure that more people understand the root of the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Higher education existed - it was reasonably priced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best schools in the country were more expensive than others because that's how the free market works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People complained to the government that everybody deserved to be able to afford higher education - told the government to "invest in their future."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government decided to secure student loans so that anyone could apply for and attend college with the idea that this would be good for the country and its people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colleges saw that suddenly everybody wanted to go to college and could afford it, so they raised the price of tuition. Government just gave a big green checkbox for pretty much any loan anybody wanted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a nearly unlimited demand of people able to afford any price, the cost of tuition went up and up as expected by anyone who knows basic economics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As expected, not every investment paid off - in fact, many, many didn't. Students graduated in majors that weren't profitable or struggled to turn their $100,000 degree into a job offer that garnered a reasonable return on their investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People complained to the government about the situation that they directly created by interfering with the free market.</p>
</li>
</ol></p>

<li>Government … just like what healthcare and housing is so expensive. </li>
<li>everything is dumbed down in America.  No, going to college if you can’t count how many sides are in a triangle with your 450 math score isn’t for you </li>
<li>being a loser is worshipped and there’s no shame anymore in America.</li>

        <p>In short, the government needs to stop giving out loans. Especially since the country as a whole is in so much debt. </p>
<p>But also, many universities have gotten to a point where they have spent so much money they need to pay back that they would have to close down if that happened. They wouldn’t be able to afford their upgrades they’ve given themselves. it would cause a huge uproar but honestly I think it’d be worth it. Prices would go down and people wouldn’t be expected to go to college as much as they are now. Boom. Jobs open up, citizens and the government are in less debt, and higher education is reasonably priced and not basically required to live.</p>

        <p>But the socialists would argue they never wanted loans...they wanted the government to pay with tax money.</p>
