        <p>What's going on right now is a lot closer to reading tea leaves than being scientific. It'll be a while before we can get high quality answers from the current pandemic and it's virus. That's why I think the studies from before this pandemic are important and they were all ignored.</p>

        <p>I would like to point out how annoying masks with ear loops are.</p>
<p>I suspect that people would do better with "surgeon" style masks -- as shown in the right frame. This is what I use at work all of the time because I don't have to constantly touch my face hole region in order to manipulate my mask.</p>
<p>And, in all honestly, the ear loop thing makes it impossible to fit a mask correctly.</p>

        <p>Alright. How stupid are you guys. How do you believe that wearing masks are bad and that this pandemic is a scam the government has been working on for years? How? This is rivaling stupidity of medivial times. ThE mAsK wOnT lEt Me BrEaTe. I bet that you could wear a mask that fully encases you mouth and head for 4 hours on a halloween and not care, but god forbid that the world wants to fucking live, and you cant wear your mask outside for 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES. What do you fucking want from the world. Your not some fucking princess who gets whatever you fucking want, and this isnt a fucking game. This global pandemic could basically wipe out humanity, but i guess you're too fucking prissy to wear a fucking mask for two seconds to go buy something, and you want humanity to be wiped out? America is the land of freedom but there won't be a goddamn America cause the economy will collapse because theres a virus on the loose, because you motherfucking people are so fucking paranoid about losing your freedom which will never happen. Also, how do you think this is a joke? I bet if you got transported to the time of the black death you wouldn't fucking think this is a joke. "Oh, but so little people have died, its probably nothing." NO!!!! You know why its nothing? Because ever other county except America is fucking smart. You, you shit-for-brains IMBICILES think your google lookups and conspircy theorys are worth more than research done by people who actually know shit about this? Fuck America and fuck all of you piece of shits.</p>

        <p>Like Wikipedia you are supposed to look at the references from the video where you can read the scientific evidence about mask effectiveness from before everyone started panicking about the current pandemic and a pro-mask doctor explaining how to use the mask correctly which almost no one does.</p>
<p>I suspect though that educating yourself is not your strong point.</p>

        <p>But you can't just blindly trust that a source is correct, just because someone linked it as their source.
https://archive.vn/mK9db looks really shady, and when searching if it is credible, i couldn't find anything, so don't believe what is said in that website.
The other website also looks shady, but not as much as the first one, and most of the results that appeared when searching about it said that it shouldn't be trusted.
And the youtuber that made the video has 5 subscribers, therefore you shouldn't trust anything he says, as you shouldn't with any other youtuber, no matter the amount of subscribers.</p>

        <p>Ask yourself this question: are you trying to usefully engage in discussion or are you trying to discredit things you don't agree with? If you are trying to do the latter you are spot on. If you are trying to do the former you have work to do.</p>
<p>First you are asserting that the Oral Health Group is shady. Why? Take a look at https://www.oralhealthgroup.com/ and then go ahead and explain the shady part. Now you have to pick though: are they shady because they don't agree with you or because they do agree with you? https://www.oralhealthgroup.com/features/face-masks-dont-work-revealing-review/</p>
<p>I suspect also that you decided that "Do Masks Work?" https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/ is shady based on nothing but the title of the article because you certainly did not read it.</p>
<p>It seems that you make judgements based on assumptions about the way things look not the actual content or utility. Gee I wonder why you are pro mask.</p>

        <p>You are right I did not read any of them, and i am not saying that they are shady because i dont agree with them.
I am tired since it is late here, and i thought the websites name was archive, that is defiently on my part.
After looking at it again, the article the yt video linked got removed by oralhealthgroup, and the update to that article you linked only says that the mask isn't completely sealed, so air can still come in.
We already know that a mask isn't 100% protection from the virus, but it does help alot. If there is anything i missed in that article, please tell me.</p>

        <p>Oh I see. Do you routinely come at people with such conviction and call others idiots based on nothing more than reading the URL? I think you've proven no one should take you seriously since you demonstrated you are absolutely happy to do exactly that. "I am not saying that they are shady because i dont agree with them."

<p>I guess you could keep trying to save face here if you want to. It is somewhat amusing to watch you dig the hole deeper. Here's another shovel for you: https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1279750/retrieve</p>
<p>&rt; At  the  present  time,  the  widespread  use  of  masks  by  healthy  people  in  the  community  setting  is  not  yet  supported  by  high  quality  or  direct scientific evidence and there are potential benefits and harms to consider.</p>

        <p>Ok, first off, i am not downloading that.
And i did not call you an idiot, i am trying to act civilized.
I didn't just look at the link, i just didn't notice the very top of the site.
And how do you know i wouldn't think it looked shady if i agreed with it?
And this is a genuine question:
Why would the government and many studies say that we should wear masks, if they didn't help? And i know many think it has something to do with control, but how does wearing a mask make us more controlable?</p>
<p>And if this really is all about control, how did nearly all countries leaders agree on using masks as a form of suppresion, if all the leaders have very diffrent ideologies, and mindsets? Im just curious, this isn't a "got'cha" moment, im just wondering.</p>
<p>But im going to bed now, I will try to respond to your answer (if you make one) in about 10 hours or so</p>

<p>Why won't you download that PDF? Do you think the World Health Organization is trying to attack your computer through their publication of "Advice on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19" available from https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks - navigate down to the bottom of the page to find the exact same hyperlink I just gave you.</p>
<p>&rt; And i did not call you an idiot</p>
<p>Is your memory so faulty that you can not remember what you wrote at the start of this very thread? "Oh, you have convinced me, 1 youtube video is of course more trust worthy than countless proffesional [sic] scientist [sic], yall [sic] are stupid." </p>
<p>&rt; Why would the government and many studies say that we should wear masks, if they didn't help?</p>
<p>I believe this perversion of science can be attributed to the following things: panic induced mass delusion, wishful thinking, desperation, and calculated lying involving emotional support masks to get people comfortable with going out so the economy can get going again.</p>
<p>I personally don't believe the masks will help prevent the spread of the virus but I consider that an opinion that I have reached through synthesis of many available sources I've read. Aside from my opinion the consensus is absolutely that the masks are only effective when they are worn correctly and my observations as well the observations of other even pro-mask physicians says that the vast majority of the public wears either the wrong type of mask, wears the mask incorrectly, and when wearing the masks break contamination protocol in a way that makes using the mask more dangerous than not wearing one.</p>
<p>"Why Masks Don't Work" includes the general public being so incompetent at wearing them that they in fact don't work.</p>

        <p>The dude in the video verifies what most health professionals are saying.</p>
<p>Reality:  masks are not 100% effective.  No one is saying they are.  They likely offer some protection, especially with decreasing the droplets that the wearer spews into the air.  That’s the true benefit, and the same reason why the tradition in operating rooms has always been for everyone in the room to wear a mask, except the patient, for the sole purpose of protecting the patient.</p>
<p>Simple masks don’t do much to protect you, they do more to protect others.  This of course, assuming appropriate hand hygiene and wearing, not below the nose or around the chin.</p>

        <p>If you ask a doctor around here in person, such as when they are seeing you as a patient, they tell you take the masks off unless you have symptoms and they want people to wear masks as little as possible. If you ask the county legislature it's "masks are 100% proven to stop the virus." Telling everyone to wear a mask just to wear the mask is making this worse: <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/</a> </p>
<p>Yes people are saying that masks 100% stop the virus, why are you saying that no one says that? Have you seen anyone get the nuance right?</p>

        <p>Poor choice of words (in my part).  Most doctors worth their salt wouldn’t dismiss masks.  It’s a simple risk/benefit analysis we do every day in medicine.  They do not harm, and probably offer some protection and mitigation of spread.  It’s a no brainer.</p>
<p>But doctors are just as susceptible to this political football as the public is.  I’ve heard anesthesiologists, surgeons, dismiss this.  Epidemiologists, other surgeons, etc take a more sober approach.</p>
<p>I work at a tertiary center that’s in the top 50 of the country.  Almost everyone here acknowledges that the science is not perfect, but masks provide benefit.  We saw this in our covid units, no one caught it.</p>

        <p>What do you mean masks do not do any harm? That is only true if they are worn correctly which almost no one does; when worn incorrectly they are a bigger threat to the wearer than not wearing one. Part of the reason why is the mask advocates set very poor examples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KU8nHVs6EM</p>

        <p>I’m not arguing inappropriate use.  When any tool is used incorrectly the outcomes will be poor.</p>
<p>Masks themselves, when used in the correct manner (it’s not difficult to appropriately wear a mask), are more benefit than harm.</p>

        <p>It apparently is difficult to use a mask correctly especially the part where humans touch their face nearly non-stop and the general public isn't being instructed on how to do this correctly and is routinely being shown examples of how to do it wrong. This is literally making the situation worse. This is the difference between mask studies in a lab, your observations of the general public using masks under the guidance of trained professionals, and the general public being left to run around in the wild on their own.</p>
<p>The actual real world effectiveness of masking the general public must be nearly zero. You are advocating for theater. Are you even reading the links and such? <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-masks-work/</a></p>
<p>&rt;But I think perhaps the biggest factor in terms of the general public use of face masks is the intention to treat consideration – how are people actually using their face masks. The data shows that the modest decrease in risk of spread is only there if people use their masks consistently and properly. When they don’t, what little protection there is vanishes.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Now I am going to introduce some personal anecdotal information, through my observations over the last two months. I am still seeing patients, with maximal precautions, which includes everyone who comes into the clinic wearing a face mask. I have also been deliberately observant when I am out in the public (for essential services). What I have observed is most people not using their masks properly. Many people have the mask below their nose, which is essentially useless. Or the mask is on loosely. But far and away the greatest violation of protocol is that people touch their mask or temporarily remove their mask, and frequently adjust their mask. This is understandable. Non health-care providers are not used to wearing masks. They were not trained how to use them. The masks can be uncomfortable, and whenever you cannot touch your face, it itches. So people are constantly fidgeting with their masks.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This may be worse than useless. We now have data of virus deposition on the outside of face masks, so touching your mask is a good way to spread the virus. Also, there is the “false sense of security” issue. People may feel they don’t have to be a rigorous with social distancing because they are wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’m at work, so arguing over what I’ve read thus far.  Usually I need to sit down and look at the data presented before weighing it.</p>
<p>But reading the excerpt, hand hygiene I’ll reiterate from my previous post.</p>
<p>Logical arguments only go so far.  There’s a plethora of data from our Asian counterparts (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Etc) that suggest masks are a positive.  And consider, there’s a factor here that we haven’t spoken of, not just infection, but viral load.</p>
<p>To me, it’s cut and dry, good to air on the side of caution.  And as an example, I adjust my mask all the time also, it’s par for the course, but I also wash my hands a LOT, throughout the day.</p>

        <p>As I've stated before, when being diligent not to contaminate surfaces, after touching your masks, hand hygiene is king.  There's been a serious, critical lack in central leadership in regards to this.  With public health, there needs to be a clear, consistent, simple message for the public.  That obviously has not happened.  Conspiracy or not, I try not to waste time on things I can't control.  What I try to do is use the time I have to make these situations a little better.</p>

        <p>I’ll look at the numbers.  A lot at play with the analysis, test rates, changes in test rates, positivity rates, date of mask mandates as it relates to incubation periods, etc.</p>
<p>We can be wrong, but as I said, airing in caution has little downside when looking at the mountain of evidence that masks do work.</p>

        <p>What cracks me up is the massive selection bias going on for the pro-mask people. You cite your own anecdotal evidence as masks working because as you said people wear them around you at work and no one got sick. That is also all the proof the CDC needs too because of the widely cited hair stylist case study which has some pretty serious limitations in it.</p>
<p>As long as this low quality anecdotal evidence agrees with you it's fine. But when observations of the real world are indicating across the board the public is using masks incorrectly such that they are either not effective or worse, dangerous to the mask wearer, that information is thrown out the window.</p>

        <p>Well, remember I said the people that I work with, the ones in the units.  Taking care of patients that have HFNCs, exposed to huge viral loads.  The fact no one got sick with those patients coughing on you I thought was impressive and a little beyond anecdote.  That’s what I was saying, and I did mention it was anecdote.</p>
<p>Going to the store?  I use Asian models, Japan, Etc.  It seems to work.</p>

        <p>Have you read the WHO guidance on masking the general population? It's pretty good and it not only covers the general public but also specifically health care settings. If there is mountains of evidence that proves that masks work someone should really tell the WHO because they have an entire team of people eagerly waiting to see it and then publish updates to their guidance once it is available.</p>
<p>Their current position is that there is no high quality conclusive evidence proving that masking works for the general public and I think they explain why pretty well. They also warn heavily about extrapolating from health care results to the general public and explain the risks associated with wearing masks incorrectly and the need to balance those risks against the ability of the population to wear them correctly.</p>
<p>They offer the advice that people with symptoms should definitely wear a mask but also stay home and then see a doctor. I would say this is a reasonable way to approach the abundance of caution technique for wearing a mask. They also say that if the general public is to wear masks it should be done in specific settings such as when distancing can't be achieved. They do not ever say that everyone should slap a mask on their face every time one goes out.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 or 20 minutes to read their guidance top to bottom and it's quite interesting. Direct link to the paper is https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1279750/retrieve and it's referenced from https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks so you know I'm not trying to pull some trick like directing you at outdated guidance.</p>
