        <p>Haha, they are totally missing the point in that comment section. It's not just that people <em>litter</em> supposedly "biohazardous" masks, but there isn't even a designated biohazard <em>receptacle</em> for face diapers. You're expected to just toss them in the waste bin by your office desk or whatever, along with granola bar wrappers and junk mail. It's a joke.</p>

        <p>What a load of rubbish. Go to a hospital. We have at least 3 kinds of trash in a regular hospital. Regular, yellow and sharps. </p>
<p>The yellow bins are used for your generic hazardous waste, they are collected separately and the contents are incinerated. In these bins general PPE is placed. There's no reason governments could not have instigated proper bins across countries for collection of used PPE like masks and gloves. Given the sheer amount of money spent elsewhere. You don't even need special training to collect such waste just some simple extra precautions like wearing gloves yourself and sealing the bags with proper ties.</p>

        <p>No because they don't contain a deadly biohazard. Unlike masks that contain COVID... Unless, is COVID is not as bad as you believe it to be? Or I guess you don't care about those who deal with your trash, very caring of you, I guess we aren't all in this together after all...</p>

        <p>Ha you're like a child who can't think of a comeback, it's sad and a little pathetic.<br>
Try to think for a moment: coronavirus is this deadly thing that you need to wear a mask for to prevent it's spread in normal social interactions since anyone could be spreading it. It's something you need to wash your groceries for, maybe even leave them out overnight. Yet it's perfectly A-okay to discard these masks, that are potentially teaming with said pathogen anyway you want to.</p>
<p>Does this not strike you as odd? Does it not seem like a worthwhile measure to ensure safe disposal of the masks the public are using?</p>
<p>In a medical environment PPE is disposed of properly. Gloves go in the biohazard bin along with masks. In our current environment masks are tossed in general waste, littered on the ground or even reused.</p>
<p>Or maybe I should resort to your level and ask; do you lick windows?</p>

        <p>Funny how the same type of people who use a mask in their own car are suddenly fine with eating with friends in a full restaurant or cafeteria. I've seen it with my own eyes.</p>

        <p>A woman on Sam Seder's majority report was virtue signalling and complaining saying "I went to a restaurant with my mother who is vulnerable and has immune issues, I had to keep complaining to the manager because they were seating other people too close to us, I was like seriously she's at risk why are you doing this blah blah"  </p>
<p>I was just like? Really? If you believe masks are so powerful why would you voluntarily go out to eat in a restaurant where you have to remove your mask to eat? Why didn't you get it to go?  </p>
<p>If your mother is so in fear of your life and you are too, even if it wasn't your responsibility to <em>JUST STAY HOME</em> in the first place, why would you remain there and just complain as if it's a nuisance that your loved one's life is supposedly at risk?  </p>
<p>If an Ebola infected man came into a restaurant I would literally run from there, if ebola was spreading in the community I wouldn't be going to a swimming pool and "taking off and putting on my biohazard suit in between laps in the pool" while crowding around many strangers, like "putting on mask between bites".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's because these people are so wrapped up in acting superior and virtue signalling they act hypocritical with no self awareness, because in their head they're always right.  </p>
<p>Subconsciously they know this is nothing, but the narrative is good people "take it seriously" so they make sure to follow through the theater, even when it makes no sense.  </p>
<p>They don't care that it makes no sense to be fearful and shut down a lot of society based on risk but then go out and expose yourself to risk, it doesn't matter.  </p>
<p>All they care is that they get to do what they want but also don't have to drop the moral high ground as a result of assuming risk, they just rationalise that the safety theater  (whatever the state governor/ mayor mandates) makes the risk zero and also they can still wag the finger at others based on holding a devout obsession with being self appointed morality/pandemic police.</p>

        <p>If corona virus was as deadly as they want us to believe, a mask would be useless. But since the mask is in theory a shield for germs, tp is a shield for our hands. Would underwear be a better analogy? You don’t want to wear your ball sweat 2 days in a row so you’d change out your mask after each use. But you see expensive masks that people just reuse.</p>

        <p>If everyone had worn their masks and followed the rules correctly we would have been out of this shitty mess in 3-4 months at worst. But here comes the problem: the only thing that protects from what you listed is education, which obviously lacks in many people. Not their fault, don't get me wrong, schools suck all over the world and fail all the time.</p>

        <p>See there's one of those moving goal posts right there.</p>
<p>They told us TWO WEEKS to begin with "if everybody just obeyed." Not 3 to 4 months.</p>
<p>Many people who DID wear a mask for an entire year have stopped recently, because collectively, we are done with this. </p>
<p>The government can keep "warning" us with their fear porn. It makes no difference.</p>
<p>Until otherwise healthy people start dying left and right, there is nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>This should be good news. Many predictions for how this virus would play out turned out to be huge overestimations. The year has passed, and we've all lived through it. People are not dying. We can go outside and live our lives. It's that simple.</p>

        <p>Two weeks is unrealistic, if not stupid. The virus' incubation time ranges from 2 to 14 days, which virtually means that someone who contracted it on the day before the lockdown might have manifested the first symptoms on the last days or even on the first day out. Now, I don't remember what my government told us (I'm Italian), but since they decided to basically give up economy to try and save lives and hospitals, if they said two weeks back in march, they were telling a lie to keep everyone, or most, calm. Now, I don't know what your aimed at, but I guess they wanted to keep the economy alive (I honestly don't know what's better, won't argue against this choice) so I really don't know what those two weeks were for</p>

        <p>Well, as others have pointed out ad nauseum at this point... I'm not convinced we need any measures at all for any "virus" that's around currently. Maybe if I knew someone who knew someone who died of this, but even then... that would be ONE person. I haven't heard of anyone I know knowing anyone who's died of this, and I've heard a TON of people say the same thing. 6 degrees of connection or whatever, right?</p>

<p>And yeah, way to bring up to old people who died. Which I already excluded IN ALL CAPS  at the end of my last comment. </p>
<p><em>Was</em> it before their "time?" Or would a good old case of the flu have had the same affect on ol grandpa?</p>
<p>Edit: also, if you're going to bring up TWO whole people... what about all the suicides? I mean YOUNG people killing themselves, because they feel they have nothing to love for if this is what society is going to be? Those lives aren't as important as grandpa's? Or are you the hypocrite here, only caring about covid lives and deaths, no other deaths (or lives) matter.</p>

        <p>Again, masks are for other people's safety. If you want to be fully protected, go on and buy a bio hazard suit. Want an easy example that masks work better than nothing? Some weeks ago my aunt visited us I don't know what for, and wore a mask for the whole time because her job has a decent risk of corona exposure. Less than a week later she developed covid symptoms and tested positive, while my family is completely fine</p>

        <p>&rt; 1/ your assumption is every one is a disease vector walking around.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the point. You could be walking around shedding virus everywhere and not have a clue so it's best to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>&rt;2/ it prevents droplets but not aerosol.</p>
<p>True, but some reduction is better than no reduction at all. Perfect is the enemy of good. Droplets are also larger and probably contain a proportionally larger amount of virus particles. </p>
<p>&rt;3/ if it really did in fact stop virus on its track then the wearer would be protected from external aerosols. double or triple the mask to double or triple the protection.</p>
<p>Masks were never supposed to stop the virus in its tracks, I don't know how you got that impression. It's a % defense buff that makes a better outcome more likely than without it. It's not black and white between either no protection or perfect protection, it's a numbers game. </p>
<p>&rt;4/ https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/world/coronavirus-who-masks-recommendation-trnd/index.html</p>
<p>&rt;either who/fauci lied and didnt care back in march 202, or they were speaking truth and now they're lying.</p>
<p>"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit" - that just means "nobody has done a study yet to intentionally test for this specific thing." It doesn't mean "nobody needs to or should wear a mask" it just means we don't know either way. Like "hey Bob is the dog in the yard?" "I don't know Lisa, I haven't had a chance to look outside." </p>
<p>At the time it seemed to make sense to prioritize the mask supply for frontline medical workers, and it was right at the beginning of it all when nobody really knew much of anything for sure. </p>
<p>Then as time passed and more information was collected and analyzed the evidence began to suggest it could be transmitted without showing symptoms, and that discovery specifically is basically the whole reason for universal masking. </p>
<p>&rt;5/ empirical evidence from states that never have mask mandate (south dakota, georgia) or 3rd world countries, the homeless population etc proves that mask isnt effective.</p>
<p>It may be evidence worth taking into account but it's not proof by a long shot. There are way too many variables to take into account to really know for sure. </p>
<p>Here's some evidence supporting masking being effective:</p>
<p>"Kansas counties with a mask mandate saw a 6% drop while counties without one saw 100% increase."
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e2.htm  </p>
<p>"When it came to masks, an analysis of 29 unadjusted and 10 adjusted studies demonstrated that the use of masks was also associated with a large decrease in transmission, both for N95 masks and for disposable surgical masks or similar reusable 12- to 16-layer cotton masks. "
https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/do-face-masks-decrease-the-risk-of-covid-19-transmission/?fbclid=IwAR3ZfnVr9Q3Dd8eqoipb3QhZB_-47a2Iqy8A4-nBm3sKblYvvsZGQysWpsk  </p>
<p>"Assessing the credibility of the various estimates, we conclude that face masks reduce the daily growth rate of reported infections by around 40%."<br>
http://ftp.iza.org/dp13319.pdf</p>
<p>"Universal masking at MGB was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among HCWs [healthcare workers]."
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768533  </p>
<p>&rt;6/ https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a5.htm#contribAff</p>
<p>&rt;also proves no difference between mask wearers or non mask wearers in term of infection.</p>
<p>I glanced through that study and either I'm missing something or it really doesn't prove anything like that at all. It's a really weak, very broad study overall, and the data is self-reported which is inherently unreliable. </p>
<p>The only thing it concludes is: "close contact with persons with known COVID-19 or going to locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options were associated with COVID-19 positivity. Adults with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant than were those with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results."</p>
<p>Soooo yeah, super broad, super unspecific, doesn't even make a comparison between mask and no mask. </p>
<p>&rt;7/ its a "disease" with 99.9+% chance of survival for most ages below 60, non overweight, with no comorbidity, not a pandemic.</p>
<p>Why put quotes around disease? Are you insinuating it doesn't exist or is government nanites or something? </p>
<p>2/3rds of all Americans are overweight or obese. Some 37 million Americans have lung conditions. "Below 60, non overweight, no comorbidity" is a minority group. edit: also survival isn't the only thing to thing about, something like 10% of people have <a href="https://abc7.com/covid-long-haulers-symptoms/9632046/">long term symptoms</a> and it attacks the vascular system so <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2021/01/21/1-in-8-covid-death/">things like heart attack and stroke go way up</a> after recovering from it. Even asymptomatic lung scans look worse than smokers'. </p>
<p>pan·dem·ic: (of a disease) prevalent over a whole country or the world.</p>
<p>Is a pandemic by definition.</p>

        <p>ill discuss the kansas city cdc study in point 3/ below, but first let me address a few things:</p>
<p>1/ asymptomatic does not spread.</p>
<p>2/ assuming someone is diseased til proven otherwise is similar to assume men are rapist or black people are violent til proven otherwise. it is gross and a violation of rights.</p>
<hr>
<p>3a/ <em>according</em> to that study then yes the cases in mask mandated counties dropped from 330/day (pre-mandate) to 310/day (a month post-mandate)</p>
<p>wonderful right?? would you agree that if mask mandate be kept in place over a longer period of time we would see a similar figures or gradual decrease in cases?</p>
<p>WRONG lmao. i dont have data for mandated kansas counties so look at kansas city missouri, next to the mandated city/county kansas city kansas but bigger population, which itself has its own mandate.</p>
<p>case spiked in july, dropped in august, then spiked in sept, oct, nov etc.</p>
<p>https://kcmo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/a9cb1fa166aa44de99dab0b946b08799</p>
<p><strong>care to explain?</strong> lol</p>
<p>3b/ just as the cdc and its people manipulated the data to fit their agenda, i could do same too.</p>
<p>according to the same study, 2/3rd of population of kansas state lives in mandated counties, and non surprisingly, the number of daily cases in mandated counties accounted for 72% of daily cases, offering absolutely no statistical difference between mask vs non-mask usage.</p>
<hr>
<p>yes its a fake disease, flu-rebranded.</p>
<p>u dont see dead people strewn on the street in the slums of 3rd world countries do you? or dead homeless people??</p>
<p>they don't have the health infrastructure like us, no if little means and ways to test, social distance, work from home, to order takeout.</p>
<p>im not even discussing the highly inflated ifr and case, just things you can observe hopefully wake something up in you.</p>
<p>think about that.</p>

        <p>I'm not american, so there's no risk of ever coming in contact with "the rest of you", but I kind of care for my folks, you know? Even if it's just a flu as you probably think, why take it? You like flu? Cause I'm not a fan of feeling absolutely shit for a week or more. And btw, the community kind of depends on not getting it. What if all supermarkets workers just sneeze on each other because they can't get over being mildly annoyed and "muh body muh choice", they all have to stay home/be hospitalised and the whole supermarket system just goes down?</p>

        <p>Masks are not <em>always</em> better than nothing - people wear them wrong all the time, and are constantly adjusting them, which means more touching of the face than normal, which is one of the main things you're <em>not</em> supposed to do.</p>
<p>Good on you for washing yours and changing it daily, but not everyone is like you. People are idiots. Forcing them to wear a mask assumes that everyone will do so as correctly as you - <em>they will not</em>.</p>

<p>Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite. These shifting guidelines may have sowed confusion among the public about the utility of masks.</p>
<p>But health experts say the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wearing masks, the better.</p>
<p>But please I bet there’s a better sources from not experts in the subject to cater to your ideology, literally hundreds of thousands of people died but it’s not real, I don’t get your logic why lie about a disease the government has shifted it’s not about left or right it’s bout people’s own life’s to care about outside of yours(everyone who fits themselves in this category)</p>

        <p>And most of the fossils - the genuinely elderly in their 70s or older - would probably be glad to go if it wasn't for their children guilting and shaming them into sticking around for those 2 more years. It's the folks in their 40s through 60s who can't seemingly can't come to terms with mortality.</p>

        <p>I just want a better point of conversation of why to not wear a mask, like the amount of spit that is caught in a mask when sneezing and when coughing is proven, it’s literally a small line of defense for people who are most at risk I don’t get the harm it would do to you(the individual). Show me something where a mask is harmful to you( a reliable source please) and I can change my view but no one ever has an article to show it causes damage vs the obvious help, just sounds like the decent thing to do, it’s not new, countries around the world have been doing this with great outcome.  Show me a reason not to, besides “it’s my right not to.” Please</p>

        <p>It’s dehumanizing. I’m not OK with giving up up facial expressions for the slim protection a mask is believed to provide. Masks have served to keep the virus top of mind, and to divide the population, making pro-free breathing people targets of the fearful and virtue signallers. That’s their real benefit (from the politicians’ perspective). Forget mask studies. Try to find a jurisdiction where mask mandates have curbed the spread, even with near total compliance. You won’t be able to.</p>

        <p>What facial expressions to random people do you have to make?? Seriously, if you around buddies you don’t wear mask it’s literally strictly a public matter, people can see your smile in your eyes my guy, it doesn’t really stop you making expressions unless your mouth is open and tongue is out which is the bests reason to wear a mask cuz you don’t got to give a fuck how you look lol, all I’m saying is you’re helping people if you don’t you put them more at risk as my article has shown but please show me one to prove you right. I’ve already proved myself right, but show me a study where everyone wearing mask didn’t help the population 🤙🏽 </p>
<p>Also if your think it’s to divide the population you are wrong just wear a damn mask it’s not dehumanizing it’s meant to help people but if the “slim chance” of helping someone is too much for you I really can’t convince otherwise you are just selfish, I’ve never felt infringed wearing one I only hope I don’t accidentally make some older folk sick </p>
<p>But fuck me for caring about old people right? I mean cumeo or whatever his name is fucked up with the elderly it obviously effects older people, I don’t get how you don’t want to harm these people.</p>
<p>I’m done, hopefully someone takes this to heart in this sub, I feel yall wanting freedom but at what cost to your fellow community? What’s the worst from probably helping vs absolutely not helping? I hope I can actually gain insight instead of another roast of how im wrong, educate me.</p>

<p>I don't speak for everyone here, but my comfort is more important than some hypothetical stranger's safety. Almost everyone I know who would actually be at risk is already dead from those risk factors, and who are still alive and at risk don't particularly care. That said, I'd wear 10 masks before I take the vaccine. You can take a mask off, but you can't take a vaccine out.</p>

        <p>That's why you cycle through multiple masks and wash them. Clean mask every day and lowering the transmission rate. This disease is real I know people that have died and have autoimmune family members so I wear a mask cause it's common sense during a pandemic</p>

        <p>Same. I have so far picked them up on a mountain, in my front yard, in plenty of parking lots, and out of the ocean from my kayak. I hate litter, it's so depressing.</p>

        <p>Good man!  I've always hiked, biked, and kayaked around in the nearby and far off naturescapes and litter is so fucking depressing.  There was a time when I could go to a state park and hike a trail and not see one person or one piece of trash on the forest floor.  Those days are gone.  </p>
<p>Now the parks are packed, which is GREAT! I love to see people out and about doing stuff that is not shopping related, lol.  But god, the increase in hikers and stuff has driven the litter to a level I haven't seen since I was a kid in the 70's.  Back then people would just chuck their trash out the car window.  And people are starting to do that again.</p>

        <p>My neighbors' masks sometimes land in my yard. I use a stick to fling them back into the neighbors' yard. They also have the bass on their car speakers way too loud. And they smoke meth. Like Wendy from Breaking Bad. Yet fatso with the loud bass - who, now that I think about it, maybe doesn't smoke quite as much meth as his mother - is actually worried about getting the rona. That's a masker for you: fat rotting "health nut" who thinks tofu makes up for all the booze and meth.</p>

        <p>I disagree.</p>
<p>Even if it were a real pandemic, the water, changing weather, sunlight, fresh open air, and all of that jazz would kill the virus before it could reach anyone else.  Even if someone stepped on this mask and then later touched their shoes, the virus would very very likely be dead by then.  Even if the virus got onto that person's hands, if that person washed them, or didn't touch their face for long enough, that virus would die on their hands.</p>
<p>Still with me?</p>
<p>Even if the virus then got into the person's mouth, if it gets caught in saliva and mucus and never gets inhaled into the lungs, it still won't make the person sick.  If the virus made it into the person's stomach, their stomach acid would destroy it.</p>
<p>Then, if it finally somehow did manage to get from that mask on the ground and into a person's lungs, its still a matter of how much of the virus actually gets in, and how quickly antibodies are formed to fight it.  So if the person gets a lot of sun, and eats a decent diet, they will likely be fine.</p>
<p>Then after they get sick, it's a matter of whether they get a severe enough case to actually notice they are sick.  Even then, they might only have such mild symptoms that it barely matters.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh and lets not forget that if the person who was wearing the mask didn't have it, nothing I said matters.</p>
