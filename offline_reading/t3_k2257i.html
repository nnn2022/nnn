    <strong>Therapy and the New Normal seems impossible</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, this year has been rough for me &amp; for anyone of you I believe!!<br>
I hope someone could give advice or share their story about it.</p>
<p>I'm in therapy since September and I know I have a lot of personal issues but one of the main aspects why I'm feeling depressed is the world state we're currently in. I just simply can't generate hope that everything will be better due to the facts we all know. I know I wouldn't be as depressed as I am, back in 2019 only with my personal issues.<br>
I have problems swallowing this forced pill but I don't know how to open up to my therapist about this, without being seen as a crazy conspiracy theorist and a possible wrong diagnosis (paranoid???schizophrenic??which I'm not!!! I'm most of the time normal, i just battle depression)</p>
<p>My therapist is very kind, but also one of the people who are accepting the laws &amp; always saying "lockdowns are going to end &amp; everything will be normal" but I simply can't believe it.  She, as a professional, doesn't see the affects &amp; manipulations going around and that makes me even harder to open up. I know, no therapist should say "yap the world we're living in is a lie, everything's crap blabla" but denying my concerns, just make me feel even more depressed/crazy looking.</p>
<p>Is anyone in a similiar situation or has any tips how to NOT feel crazy even though I asked for help &amp; do everything to make me feel better. I don't want meds for THE WRONG CAUSE. I want help, someone who takes me serious, but I don't think it's possible right now.<br>
Has anyone had similiar experiences? Please share if so, this sub has helped me in so many ways (THANK YOU ALL FOR THAT ♥ Y'ALL GOLDEN) </p>
<p>I just have this question and maybe you sharing your insights/thoughts/experience could lift me up a little bit.</p>
<p>Lots of love to y'all</p></p>

        <p>When it comes to what's happening, counsellors and therapists are no different from most. They have no idea of the future, nor an idea of what they are going to do. Imagine it's like trying to discuss particle physics with them, they could only say something mundane like "particles go brr." Therapy is the time to focus on your emotional responses so you can deal with <em>your</em> stuff. What the therapist believes or knows doesn't matter. Obviously it's difficult to separate your feeling from what's happening, but how you feel is the part you can change most effectively right now.  Maybe consider humanistic or client-centered therapy to keep it focused on <em>you.</em></p>
<p>First thing, fill up the tank so much as you can. You already know the answer; better diet and exercise, less screens and other addictions.</p>
<p>Find the meaning beyond, or because of, all of this. Great time for you to be working on your stuff for sure, I wonder what else you really care about that could give you a sense of purpose and control throughout the day?</p>
<p>The fight is important, but unless we take care of ourselves, we aren't as strong as we can be. You know there's strength in you, just waiting to get out. How can you channel that energy? Projects, spirituality, discipline, you tell me?</p>

        <p>Hmmmm this is such good food for thought. Sincerly thank you, I was maybe too emotional while typing this and didn't think of it in a way you described. It's Tru, we cant fight a battle when we arent strong enough. I appreciate your Response so much!!!</p>

        <p>I wish I knew what to tell you but this is the exact reason I’ve avoided therapy. If your therapist doesn’t seem like a doomer, you could try bringing it up and see how they react. If they get weird or try to shame you, fire them and look for a different therapist.</p>
