    <strong>Is M-ercola bending over to the deep state?</strong>
    <p><p>I recently heard that M-ercola was deleting all his articles, and I was kind of taken back at hearing that. I checked his website hoping to scrape as many articles as I could before they were gone, but I was already too late. I'm kind of shocked he actually did this. I can understand him taking down the articles, but to remove everything from public access almost seems wrong. If he could have at least provided one final download with all his articles in some format, it would have helped many people.</p>

<p>I know personally several articles from M-ercola helped me in the past, and it seems like he is bending over to the deep state by deleting everything like this. From hearing his response, it is to protect himself and his employees, which I completely understand, but it almost seems like he is recanting everything that he ever wrote. I know it has been said before, but we are literally living in N-azi Germany.</p>

<p>It seems like this would be the most important time to release all of his articles instead of removing them from public access. I just wish I would have known earlier, and had a chance to scrape everything. More valuable data has just been swept down the memory hole forever.</p>
<p>For some reason this post kept getting auto removed every time I tried to post it, so I tried putting dashes through the names. This is my third time trying to post it, not sure what is going on.</p></p>

        <p>Looks like the dashes worked... I wonder if one of the mods can explain why this kept getting immediately removed?</p>
