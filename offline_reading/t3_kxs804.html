        <p>I don't know about that, aren't they now super supportive of all this lockdown-bullshit?</p>
<p>It's been spoiled, listening to RATM now feels like listening to a juvenile teenager stringing together some anti-establishment words, without understanding what he's actually saying.</p>
<p>...and through this all, we learn that actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DirL4RI1448">Eric Clapton and Van Morrison</a> are the real anti-establishment heroes we deserve. Huh, who'da thunk?</p>

        <p>Well, that <em>is</em> (or <em>was</em>, or is <em>supposed</em> to be) their politics. Anarchism.</p>
<p>Which is cool by me, but that would also mean, fuck the state, fuck them telling me when or where I can go or whom or how many I can meet, which shops can be open, which need to close, and so on, and so forth, because they inherently believe in people's ability to self-govern.</p>
<p>You can't support lockdowns and claim to be an Anarchist, those are two fundamentally opposed concepts.</p>

        <p>I agree. There are Facebook groups full of old punks and travellers and they all seem to be pro lockdown and pro mask. I just cant get my head round why. These same people used to ram police cars out of the way with their trucks to put on illegal parties and festivals</p>

        <p>I see this so much in real life. I’m 39 and the old punk crowd is 95% suddenly in love with following the rules and falling in line and it’s just not what I would have expected. Is it just because they’ve been so conditioned to hate Trump above all else, and tricked into loving the lockdowns/ masks because Trump at least pretends to be against those things? Or partly because musicians who haven’t made it a career tend to grow up and get jobs in IT and they’ve been working from home and WFH ppl tend to be more scared of Covid? Does it have to do with smoking weed? My husband’s bandmates who are younger than us have been afraid to practice and he’s been afraid to ask anyone else because the other musicians we know are super doomers. I have a few friends who will hang out with me but definitely not from the crowd I used to see at shows. Why do old punks love the state so much?</p>

        <p>&rt;I got into a conversation online with a guy and he asked me out for a date to a bar. I agreed under specific terms: it had to be a bar that was following social distancing, outdoor seating with spread out tables, and I wanted to be as far away from anyone else as humanly possible. All seemed fine, he chose the bar as I'm not familiar to the area, I checked online and saw they had a huge outdoor area (think backyard sized) with picnic tables far apart from each other. </p>
<p>&rt;Cue to date night, I get to the bar masked up and he approaches me and goes in for a hug. I backup a few steps and remind him I wanted distance. He seemed disappointed but listened (a little begrudgingly). His mask wasn't all the way over his nose and any attraction I'd had for him basically died right away. We go around the side of the bar to the back and the back area is PACKED. At least 50 people, all in large groups, no one wearing masks. I immediately stop and ask him if he knows somewhere else we can go because I'm not comfortable going anywhere near that cesspool of virus potential. </p>
<p>&rt;He tells me I'm being paranoid and I need to loosen up, it's not cute to guys for a girl to be so uptight. COVID isn't a big deal anyway blah blah blah. I immediately went off (respectfully, wasn't trying to get murdered) and told him about how I had gotten the virus back in March, how painful it was, how scared I had been, how depressing and mentally taxing quarantine had been. I then told him if I couldn't trust him to protect myself, himself, and others from the virus, how could I trust being around him in general? How do I know if we decided to have sex at some point he wouldn't just slip the condom off because there's 'only x chance of getting this STI/STD and it's treatable so what's the big deal'.</p>
<p>&rt;Long story short I left and went home and had ice cream. People, being an idiot during a pandemic isn't hot. Of anything it's probably one of my biggest turn offs now. Happily single for the duration of this pandemic it seems.</p>
<p>&rt;Edit; holy shit this blew up overnight. To the people offering support thank you, I really appreciate it. To the people saying I'm virtue signalling, or talking about how I shouldn't have even left my house in the first place, the only reason I ever even agreed to go was because </p>
<p>&rt;A. At that time in the area we were living in our cases were at a record low, this was not recent during a spike</p>
<p>&rt;B. It is possible to safely interact with new people following CDC guidelines. The reason I agreed to go to the place was because the tables were large, and spaced out by at least 10 feet, and there was supposedly contactless ordering (order and pay on your phone, pick up your order at a drop off window also outside so no need to be indoors at all, and no seeing or interacting with staff members. Whether this was actually what they were doing I don't know because I didn't step foot in the yard area). This place was meant to be safe for a socially distanced meetup which was the intention, and when that turned out to not be the case, I left. </p>
<p>&rt;C. He seemed to have no issues when I told him I wanted to keep my distance and that I had requirements as I haven't been or gone near a restaurant or bar since the pandemic took off back in February-ish. I was explicitly clear that I wouldn't be going near him, or any other person at this time as I had been isolated working from home, and having my groceries delivered so I hadn't even really left my house in months. He seemed okay with all these terms, I'm guessing because he assumed I would just give in and be walked all over cause I was so mentally drained and exhausted from isolating so long. That was not the case sadly for him lmao</p>
