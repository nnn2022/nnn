        <p>“Gainesville, FL (June 16, 2021) – A group of parents in Gainesville, FL, concerned about potential harms from masks, submitted six face masks to a lab for analysis. The resulting report found that five masks were contaminated with bacteria, parasites, and fungi, including three with dangerous pathogenic and pneumonia-causing bacteria. No viruses were detected on the masks, although the test is capable of detecting viruses.</p>
<p>The analysis detected the following 11 alarmingly dangerous pathogens on the masks:</p>
<p>• Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumonia) </p>
<p>• Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis) </p>
<p>• Neisseria meningitidis (meningitis, sepsis) </p>
<p>• Acanthamoeba polyphaga (keratitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis) </p>
<p>• Acinetobacter baumanni (pneumonia, blood stream infections, meningitis, UTIs— resistant to antibiotics) </p>
<p>• Escherichia coli (food poisoning)</p>
<p>• Borrelia burgdorferi (causes Lyme disease)</p>
<p>• Corynebacterium diphtheriae (diphtheria)</p>
<p>• Legionella pneumophila (Legionnaires' disease) </p>
<p>• Staphylococcus pyogenes serotype M3 (severe infections—high morbidity rates) </p>
<p>• Staphylococcus aureus (meningitis, sepsis)</p>
<p>Half of the masks were contaminated with one or more strains of pneumonia-causing bacteria. One-third were contaminated with one or more strains of meningitis-causing bacteria. One-third were contaminated with dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. In addition, less dangerous pathogens were identified, including pathogens that can cause fever, ulcers, acne, yeast infections, strep throat, periodontal disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and more.</p>
<p>The face masks studied were new or freshly-laundered before wearing and had been worn for 5 to 8 hours, most during in-person schooling by children aged 6 through 11. One was worn by an adult. A t-shirt worn by one of the children at school and unworn masks were tested as controls. No pathogens were found on the controls. Proteins found on the t-shirt, for example, are not pathogenic to humans and are commonly found in hair, skin, and soil.</p>
<p>A parent who participated in the study, Ms. Amanda Donoho, commented that this small sample points to a need for more research: “We need to know what we are putting on the faces of our children each day. Masks provide a warm, moist environment for bacteria to grow.”</p>
<p>These local parents contracted with the lab because they were concerned about the potential of contaminants on masks that their children were forced to wear all day at school, taking them on and off, setting them on various surfaces, wearing them in the bathroom, etc. This prompted them to send the masks to the University of Florida’s Mass Spectrometry Research and Education Center for analysis.”</p>

        <p>This is a strange graph. Why would a surgical mask for an 8 year old be so wildly different than a surgical mask for a 9 year old?</p>

        <p>It is a study with a low sample size (6 masks). Remind me to link to a study with a larger sample size later.</p>
