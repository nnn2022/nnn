    <strong>The Struggle (Session) is Real! ( a play in 4 acts)</strong>
    <p><p>I think one of the huge drivers of all of this nonsense is this subculture of broken, defective people that want EVERYONE else to be just as defective and broken as them all the time and a complementary subculture that is more than happy to appease them.</p>
<p>Before all this I worked in the dreaded, yet ubiquitous, open office floor plan and, as a result, typically wore headphones all day to drown out the constant noise. Over the past year I've noticed a massive, massive reduction in tinnitus (presumably thanks to not wearing headphones all day). That's been a huge relief to me and I was thinking maybe one of the rare positive side effect of all this might just be saving the hearing of a generation of people that have had to live in open office land for the past decade. Then I started to think, "Hey, I bet this is totally a thing on Twitter!" I checked and it's really not! I basically found one other person who had this experience and, oddly enough, it was 90s musician Juliana Hatfield and expressing it didn't go well! </p>
<p>We go from "my tinnitus is gone"  and "amazing how the body can heal itself" to an apology within a few hours of hysterical response Tweets. And, after a month of this shit to, "my tinnitus is back". I guess because you can never get well from anything and if you try it's an act of aggression against the chronically unwell.</p>

<p>Her Twitter feed is mostly a carbon copy of any number of lame, mainstream neo-lib talking points. Yet, she's just put out a new song called "Mouthful of Blood" (which is that way from having to bite her tongue sooooo much):</p>

<p>You'd think maybe it's about craziness like this, but no! It's about "the last four years" where I guess it was extremely unsafe to use the social medias to parrot opinions that totally consensus opinions on those platforms.</p></p>
