        <p>You would think an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù in public health would know that Asians don‚Äôt wear masks everywhere just because. They may be right now, but stop pretending that before this, they grocery shopped, went to gyms and went to the mall while wearing masks when they had no symptoms of anything.</p>
<p>I think that more Americans are eager to go to sports events and concerts and other such things than they think. When the government tells them it‚Äôs safe to go, they‚Äôll go because a lot of Americans are small minded. </p>
<p>Where did they get these experts, /r/coronavirus?</p>

        <p>The majority of mask wearing as far as I‚Äôm aware was due to high levels of pollution and smog in dense Chinese (and other South/East Asian) cities it had very little to nothing to do with any kind of virus.</p>

        <p>For the curious:</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Expect the United States to change to a mask-wearing culture</strong></p>
<p>&rt; A year from now, and even beyond that, Godwin expects to still see people wearing masks in public ‚Äî especially people who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúI think a big part of the future will be greater expectations around masks. Mask-wearing has not been part of the culture in the United States for infectious disease control other than in clinical settings,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúMask-wearing will become more normal, the way it has been in many Asian countries in recent years,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see a shift toward that.‚Äù</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Count on fewer business trips and more remote work opportunities</strong></p>
<p>&rt; With the increase in digital technologies and the realization that some industries can easily continue without sending staff across the county or across the globe, Godwin said she expects business trips will be reduced for people in most industries. </p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúMy guess is there will probably be fewer business trips. We now don‚Äôt have to be physically in the same room to accomplish many things,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>&rt; She added that work-from-home routines have accelerated the adoption of technologies like Zoom in a way that would not have happened otherwise. She expects corporations to be more flexible with remote work policies ‚Äï especially if work is still getting accomplished at home while keeping people from getting sick and helping the company with operations costs.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Don‚Äôt plan to attend a concert or sporting event just yet</strong></p>
<p>&rt; Unfortunately, as the vaccine is rolling out and determinations about its efficacy are being made, crowded sporting events and packed concerts won‚Äôt become part of our new normal.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be hard to convince people to go back to large gatherings that are simply for entertainment or recreational purposes,‚Äù Moody said. ‚ÄúI think what you‚Äôll see is clusters of people at smaller gatherings. I doubt we‚Äôre going to have big events with tens of thousands of people coming together.‚Äù </p>
<p>&rt; He voiced concerns regarding crowds inside of performing arts and sporting venues, in particular. He questioned how to safely welcome groups of people into an enclosed space and what that means for the venue.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúHow quickly are we going to be able to get people back into venues? Is it going to be a situation where venues have to charge twice as much because they can only fill half as many seats? Which then makes so many of these things out of reach for people ‚Äî I think that‚Äôs going to be really challenging,‚Äù Moody said.</p>
<p>&rt; And since fresh air circulation helps mitigate the risk of the virus, he added that outdoor social gatherings will become even more of the norm.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Expect significant psychological, societal and cultural impacts</strong></p>
<p>&rt; There is no question that people are profoundly affected by the major events that occur in their lifetime. People who lived through the Great Depression have different tendencies than those who did not; those who grew up during the Vietnam War have a different outlook than those born postwar. It is to be expected that modern-day society will be shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>
<p>&rt; Edwin Fisher, a professor of health behavior at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, noted that the psychological after-effects of disasters typically emerge six months after the event ends. He anticipates long-term mental health effects and societal changes as a result of the pandemic, which has kept millions of Americans isolated socially and physically for months.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs ubiquitous, because it‚Äôs everywhere, because it hits us 24/7, we tend to lose track of the effects of COVID on our daily lives, mood and consciousness,‚Äù Fisher said. ‚ÄúWell, what will the similar effect be of having lived through the greatest global pandemic in over 100 years? There are going to be many, many long-term effects.‚Äù</p>
<p>&rt; He worries about depression, suicide rates and marital problems ‚Äî things that are currently at heightened rates because of the pandemic. </p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Look forward to a public health system that is more prepared to handle epidemics and pandemics</strong></p>
<p>&rt; Kumar pointed out that our health system will only be more prepared for any future health crisis or future coronavirus outbreaks after what we‚Äôve experienced with the pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned a lot about our own public health systems and structures in this pandemic, and those things can only get better,‚Äù Kumar said. ‚ÄúAs we continue to move on, we‚Äôre more prepared for potential future outbreaks. Having these structures and systems in place, we can just reactivate them when we need to.‚Äù </p>
<p>&rt; Most of the general public now also understands pandemic-fighting behaviors like social distancing and mask-wearing, two things that were virtually unheard of in the U.S. before this year.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Anticipate certain levels of discord throughout communities</strong></p>
<p>&rt; While the vast majority of people are counting down the days, Fisher warned that any unrealistic and premature hyping of the vaccine could lead people to believe that all troubles will be over as soon as the needle pricks their body. </p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúI think there is a tremendous likelihood of conflict, social discord and unanticipated consequences with the arrival of the vaccine,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>&rt; Communities, co-workers, friends and families will be faced with tough decisions regarding everything from the topic of how to safely socialize after months and months of isolation to sending their child to school where there may be unvaccinated students. </p>
<p>&rt; He also stressed that there are likely going to be issues regarding vaccine distribution and the potential for inequalities around race that the illness has already highlighted and exacerbated.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>The virus won‚Äôt go away completely</strong></p>
<p>&rt; Sadly, COVID-19 won‚Äôt disappear when the vaccine is deployed. Godwin noted that the U.S. has a long history of people being opposed to vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>‚ÄúWe are already seeing people saying they wouldn‚Äôt want to get the vaccine and that limits our ability to create herd immunity, which provides protection for those who can‚Äôt get the vaccine or haven‚Äôt gotten the vaccine,‚Äù Godwin said.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>She cautioned that the virus will still be circulating even after an effective vaccine is widely available as a result of those who choose not to get the vaccine.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúWe are going to be living with COVID for a while,‚Äù she stressed.</p>
<p>There's one part I bolded that I'd like to point out. Note how they villify people who won't vaccinate along with the rest of the populace, and imply they will be at fault for the virus continuing to circulate. Just make note of this, because it's already been popping up, and will continue to do so in order to pressure people into getting the vaccine when it comes out.</p>

<h3>Expect the United States to change to a mask-wearing culture</h3>
<p>A year from now, and even beyond that, Godwin expects to still see people wearing masks in public ‚Äî especially people who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI think a big part of the future will be greater expectations around masks. Mask-wearing has not been part of the culture in the United States for infectious disease control other than in clinical settings,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMask-wearing will become more normal, the way it has been in many Asian countries in recent years,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see a shift toward that.‚Äù"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>See this is what all the maskers need to be confronted with every day... They need to realize this isn't a situation where if we all wear our masks we will be done and return to normal... the opposite is true. The more people comply and accept masks the more they will be pushed and further into the future will they be required and mandated.</p>
