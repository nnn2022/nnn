        <p>Why isn't anyone pointing fingers at the people pushing the masks mandates. The survival rate is over 99%. Make them explain why they are so happy about people fighting each other. This whole thing is slight of hand. Look at each other, instead of us. What isn't the news reporting, while everyone is satisfied with this garbage for a year now? Ignore that man behind the curtain!</p>

        <p>Because wearing a piece of cloth is obviously a government tool to control the population and not at all a  functional pice of clothing that provides some basic barrier against pathogens and/or shields your face from cold. I mean sane people never use scarves or face coverings when out in extreme temperatures such as a arctic or freezing ass Texans during a windmill storm.</p>

        <p>Well more exact, 99.996% survival rate. Also check your census numbers. 300,000,000 people? Huge liberal cities have inflated their numbers for many years to get increased funding and allow for election adjustments. IE thousands of dead people voting. People who don't live there being registered voters.</p>

        <p>The issue with the 1% fatality statistic is that 1% of according to different sources and average of around 100million people so far, that means 1million will die. But that doesn’t take into account other permanent effects. Permanent heart damage, lung damage, and brain damage just to name a few. So the issue is that if we stopped wearing masks and let the virus run rampant then millions if not billions will have permanent damage from COVID</p>

        <p>I would think an influx of older people to the state not counted in the census since they only live there for a few months out of the year would mean that in peak flu season, there is an influx of eldery people in Florida that is not documented. The ones in the census are permanent residents, and those numbers are probably under reported. </p>
<p>So, you're saying an influx of elderly people going to Florida during flu season makes the number of elderly in Florida less that what is on the census? Because that also seems to make no sense.</p>

        <p>Actually, Florida still had a ton of visitors.</p>
<p>Look, Cali is a lot larger than Florida. Florida, given the size, has less older people than California. However, there are still a lot of old people in Florida, and there are more old than there are young. Given that FL has kept everything open, their death rate, especially in the elderly, should be far greater than Cali. And yes 20k more deaths is a lot more in FL, but how is it not more? How is California only 20k elderly deaths behind FL when Cali enforced strict lockdowns and Florida remained open?</p>
<p>The elderly don't go to Cali to escape the snow. They don't retire in Cali because its expensive af. They retire in AZ and FL. Two affordable and warm states.</p>

        <p>Did you read that? There is absolutely nothing in the article that says anything about how often this happens. Without any data on how often this happens the default should be to not panic because  the most likely scenario is that it's very rare like it is with other respiratory viruses like the flu</p>

        <p>The issue is this-we all should be able to decide for ourselves how we want to proceed. If I want to wear a mask and limit social contact with others, I should be allowed to do that. If someone else does not want to wear a mask and  has frequent contact with other people that should be allowed too. The freedom to choose is what is important to me.</p>

        <p>This is why I'm so against masks. Aside from all the confusion about what they actually do, they're causing divide and hostility in our population, bringing down our communication and morale since facial expressions are important to understand each other and not understanding each other brings hate. All this senseless arguing for a disease with a 99.6% survival rate for the majority of the population.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Which is why it makes me so angry that where I live (Bay Area) we are all forced to wear one whether we agree with this stuff or not because of the ridiculous mandate. It makes it seem like everyone here is a stupid sheep who believes the bullshit and is basically forced virtue signaling.</p>

<p>it's also a story you're telling others. It says, "people around you agree with this stuff"</p>

        <p>They already confirmed that the masks were a sham. The new narrative is that obviously a single mask never worked, you need double masking or FFP2/KN95 mask. And doomers all accepted it as gospel. Even though for the whole year they said cloth masks are enough to stop the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Is it really gospel though? Is it that much of an inconvenience to wear one? Listen, I get the concern over the lockdowns and a lot of the other stuff, but not the masks. The fact that we are a year into this.and people are STILL whining about this is insane. It's such a minor inconvenience. </p>
<p>The peer- reviewed research overwhelmingly supports the idea that masks help. We've known that for a really long time. You guys are putting so much effort into fighting this. The entitlement and selfishness is beyond concerning but certainly not surprising.</p>

        <p>You're damn right I'm American. Our revolution is the reason you're capable of even using this website. </p>
<p>Living my life normally <em>does not</em> harm others. This butterfly effect narrative you people drive has no logical end.</p>
<p>I believe in self ownership as an absolute. You seem to think that society owns you. I call that slavery, not shared values.</p>
<p>I love my neighbors, which is why I feel bad for them when the go to suckle at the tits of authority as soon as the media tells them to be afraid.</p>
<p>Just think, if people will comply with shutting down the economy, locking down, and not showing their faces in public for a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate, what do you think they can be manipulated to do when a virus with a 95% survival rate is unleashed?</p>
<p>“The best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed."  -Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf</p>

        <p>Buddy shut the fuck up. Our founders were pro vaccine and even quarantine people who were infected. You guys take everything for granted. I honestly feel sorry for how fragile you babies are. That you can't even wear a fucking mask. You're living proof why the American education system is so shit and why it's so behind other countries like Germany,Sweden, S Korea and Japan.  You think people are being manipulated by mask. When I think its clearly you being manipulated. You think you're some sorta of special snowflakes. You're triggered to wear a mask and need your little safe space. It really bothers me howbhard it is for a grown adult to wear a mask. Reminds me of how conservative, or was before ,he was anti mask until he got it and got both his grandparents killed.  He now regrets how selfish. I hope you don't realize it until it's too late that's if your selfishness , bitterness and pride.</p>

        <p>I don't take anything for granted. That's why when I see the economy collapsing, homlessness skyrocketing, and so many other bad things happening, I don't hop online and go "DURRRR PEOPLE JUST NEED TO WEAR A MASK DURRR!" </p>
<p>It is you who takes things for granted. You take for granted what the media tells you, and never question whether the mainstream could be disinformation. You go out marching like a good little boy, scolding others for not doing what the government tells you.</p>
<p>You take for granted freedom and economy, the ONLY two things that keep us from being a 3rd world country.</p>

<p>The only disease these articles reference is smallpox.</p>
<p>Smallpox <strong>had a 25% lethality rate</strong> at the time.</p>
<p>&rt;Please show me any evidence that the founding fathers gave enough of a <em>flying fuck</em> to do anything about a virus that has a <strong>&lt;1%</strong> <strong>death rate</strong> </p>
<p>This is what I asked. This is what you would be asking yourself too if you thought critically. </p>
<p>I never said vaccines and quarantine (when you separate <strong>sick people</strong> from non-sick people) don't work.</p>
<p>What I did insinuate is that the founding fathers wouldn't have given up <strong>essential liberty</strong> for a virus that has a less than 1% survival rate. There is 0% evidence of this. </p>
<p>They were however willing to fight in <strong>an</strong> <strong>actual war</strong> for the right to run businesses, avoid high taxes, say what they thought, and bear arms.</p>
<p>Something tells me they wouldn't have given up half these things for something mildly more dangerous than the flu. They certainly wouldn't take what the government is telling them at face value. You would likely be a redcoat.</p>

<p>A Brit being totally ok with the degradation of freedom. Why am I not surprised?</p>
<p>You said I sound American. I am. The ones who shot at your countrymen in 1776 until you went back home <em>were also American</em>. Hence "our". Are you really this dense?</p>
<p>I also missed the part where <em>The British</em> had a people's revolution for freedom that inspired other revolutions for freedom around the world.</p>
<p>Can you point out where &amp; when that happened? Americans are the reason free speech is mainstream.  In fact, we're one of the countries you can count on a hand that actually <em>still allows free speech.</em> We're the reason you have a democracy. You're welcome.</p>
<p>&rt;Living your life normally when there’s a deadly virus prevalent does have the potential to harm others lol, it’s literally cause and effect. A butterfly effect would suggest that link is much less clear. It quite clearly is not the case...</p>
<p>Please point out the exact person(s) I've personally infected from not wearing a mask. I'll wait. Oh, you can't? Just as the butterfly effect, there <strong>is no clear link</strong>, any claim you have of me harming others involves several steps between me and the person(s) I've allegedly harmed.</p>
<p>&rt;You talk about using phones and being proud of it, and then believe in self ownership. I can’t believe you don’t see the irony.</p>
<p>I never mentioned phones. Are you ok? I do use a phone, however, and I also believe in self-ownership. The two are not mutually exclusive. Yes I am aware apps and manufacturers use my personal data for a profit, but I make the <em>consentual choice</em> to use a phone anyways. The operative word here is <em>consent.</em></p>
<p>&rt;Your love thy neighbours paragraph doesn’t even make sense. Is your point you feel bad for people for being afraid? And that’s your version of loving thy neighbours... cool.</p>
<p>Would I feel bad for someone who I loathed? I care about people, I'm not a sociopath. So of course I feel bad for them when I see that their very survival instinct is being manipulated so that others may benefit from it. <strong>Mass hysteria</strong> is a precursor to literally any tyrannical government in history.</p>
<p>&rt;You then use an adolf hitler quote on slowly taking freedoms away. Whilst it carries weight in certain arguments it doesn’t in this case. The freedoms taken away were very noticeable, but accepted because the majority of the population believes in protecting the health of others.</p>
<p>The quote is extremely relevant and you are actively demonstrating this. <em>Freedoms don't need to be taken away to combat a threat.</em> In fact, this makes things worse.</p>
<p>However, this is the 1st thing your own government did, seizing emergency powers under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_Act_2020">Corona Virus Act Of 2020</a>, literally using the rule of law to keep people from gathering together, detain "individuals suspected of being infected with Covid-19" (whatever that means), etc.</p>
<p>You let me know when you're free to gather publically and no longer are subject to be imprisoned for having a sniffle. I'm sure we'll all be a good deal older <em>if</em> that ever happens.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you ever wonder why America is basically the only country that has such a large proportion of people not wanting to wear masks?</p>
<p>Egypt, Sweden, Tanzania, the list goes on. We're not the only country not wanting to wear masks. And newsflash; the authoritarian UK isn't doing any better than the countries actively not masking up or mandating anyone to do anything surrounding Covid-19. How is this not relevant?</p>

        <p>Have you seen society? Even before covid19, we hate our neighbors. Every man for himself. Everyone is a threat. We all must get married by 24, have four kids, then be miserable for the rest of our lives. Then we judge and insult others for not ruining their lives for some bullshit ideal preached by Hollywood to keep the masses buying shit, reproducing, sending their kids to work for them so that they can buy more useless shit.</p>
<p>Society never cared about anyone but themselves. You must have never been bullied at any point in life  or you would have noticed how terrible we are to each other.</p>
<p>All this virtue signaling of care about your neighbor is because yall scared that it could come for you. If a majority of the population was naturally immune and these mask mandates only applied to those at risk, this whole mask conversation wouldn't even happen. Yall the selfish ones.</p>

        <p>Lol you obviously have lived the most sheltered of lives. No one is telling you to get married by 24 where I’m from. No one is making you have kids. If people around you hate you for that, that’s something wrong with your narrow minded community (I expect with ‘strong Christian values’)</p>
<p>I have been bullied, by children. When I was a child. People grow up. Did you not?</p>
<p>Some people in society don’t care for others and I’m replying to one, but that doesn’t mean I go into every interaction not trusting someone. I care for the population as a whole, and many people do too. Otherwise all these ‘sheep’ wouldn’t be making sacrifices for others like they are now.</p>

        <p>So where you're from? And you think my world view is selfish? You just accused me of being a sheltered Christian. Have you heard a song on the radio? Have you ever seen a movie?</p>
<p>You're telling me, someone who has been bullied, had friends with heroin problems, lost at least 15 people to suicides, survived a school shooting, survived a waffle house shooting, survived rape, have gotten out of other potential rapes, have gotten beaten by male classmates because they "thought I was cute", and am from a half hispanic half poor white neighborhood, that I am the sheltered one?</p>
<p>Gtfo. Just because YOU didn't have to go through that doesn't mean others don't. And im not a Christian, so way to assume wrong on all fronts.</p>

        <p>I didn’t call you Christian, I was talking about American rural society, which wrongfully claims to have Christian values. Your life does sound hard, and probably explains why you don’t trust anyone. Sorry you had to go through that.</p>
<p>I’m from London UK but don’t plan on sharing my hardships on the internet. Still, back to the original point - wearing a mask helps to save lives. I’m not sure why you want to suggest otherwise. And with all the hardships you’ve had to go through, I’m quite surprised wearing a mask is the thing you’re so angry about...</p>

        <p>I never said anything pro mask or anti mask. I said all this virtue signaling is a cover up for fear because when it comes to anything else, we don't care.</p>
<p>We don't care when people kill themselves. We don't care about those suffering from drug addiction. We don't care about heart disease. We don't care about violence against women. We don't care about people who die in car accidents. We have the "if it doesn't bother me then why should I care" approach.</p>
<p>So when all of a sudden, people "care about their fellow neighbors " after ignoring them for decades and berating them for being different, I see it as a bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p>Also, government has never done anything for the good of the people. You should know that better than anyone ving from England, one of the most ruthless governments to other countries throughout the entire world.</p>

        <p>We do care about those things. At least here in the UK we do. The US is far behind on social progression compared to us in Europe. The majority of the people taking Covid seriously are also the people to take those issues seriously too. It’s the selfish ones, who don’t care about rape, mental health etc. that seem to be the ones not caring about Covid. That’s my experience anyway.</p>
<p>And again, well done for reading a history book on our colonial past - but to say we are one of the most ruthless governments to other countries is a stretch these days. Other than following the US into wars in the Middle East, what does England do to other countries? We have one of the highest International Aid budgets as a proportion of our GDP of any major country.</p>

        <p>Well I did more than read a history book. I agve a degree in Medieval Studies. I am sure native South Africans are super grateful for the British presence there. They love the racism, I am certain. Im sure the native tribes of New Zealand and Australia are beyond grateful for losing their culture and way of life to the Brits, who removed healthy organic food, made the tribes destitute, then gave them junk food and sodas to survive on for the rest of their lives. I know Ireland loves England the most, given that they just got their liberation not too long ago.</p>
<p>Maybe in the UK, your people care about all things, but those that preach "listen to the science" here are also quick to deny women rights. They say that vaccine injury is an impossibility, even though multiple lawsuits against Pfizer Moderna and Merck prove that wrong. They say "well at least they didn't die of covid" when someone hangs themselves.</p>
<p>You say those in the UK all are agreeable to whats happening there, but I know several living in London and the surrounding areas that absolutely hate the police and government for arresting them in their own homes. </p>
<p>You trust yulour government. Congratulations. Now go watch Pink Floyd The Wall and see if you notice any similarities to today.</p>

        <p>The research doesn't back it up at all, hence why masks have not resulted in significant impact on Covid spread anywhere and why the WHO in 2019 did not recommend masks on healthy people for a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>In terms of real world negative effects, estimates are that 194 billion disposable masks and gloves (the majority of them being masks) are used every month. This is leading to an environmental catastrophe in terms of excess plastic consumption and ocean pollution.</p>
<p>If you are autistic, disabled, or suffer another physical or mental issue that mean masks cause huge distress or are not suitable then I'm sure you'd also disagree that "It's such a minor inconvenience". And oh, sure, most places have "exemption" criteria, but we all know the social ostracisation that people who don't wear masks face in a lot of places.</p>
<p>And on a personal level, wearing masks massively inflames my chronic sinusitis which makes my breathing incredibly uncomfortable and - ironically - causes me to have symptoms associated with Covid.</p>
<p>Wear a mask if they make you feel comfortable, sure. But don't use "Is it that much of an inconvenience to wear one?" to justify forcing others.</p>
<p>Edit: Before I inevitably get asked for sources for my studies from someone who didn't post their own: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lolmz7/anyone_who_says_there_were_no_studies_on_mask/</p>

        <p>A simple google search will turn up dozens of peer- reviewed articles that say otherwise. Again, this isn't a new thing. That idea long predates covid-19. The majority of the scientific community disagrees. </p>
<p>Bringing up the environment is the majority of people who hold those views are so anti- environment it isn't funny. These are people who praised Trump for gutting the EPA and other environmental protections repeatedly in the name of business interests. I recognize that's not necessarily you but masks haven't caused environmental catastrophe, we've been in the midst of it for decades. That is a symptom of a much larger problem.</p>
<p>Point taken on the health and mental afflictions some face but sometimes rules are designed for the greater good. Most claiming that are full of shit anyway, I've seen it repeatedly. I personally find that to be be a poor argument, as I can apply that logic to almost any public law or safety mandate. </p>
<p>It makes me really uncomfortable to drive the speed limit you know, it really aggravates my anxiety. If driving at that speed makes you feel safe, you go ahead but don't force me too.</p>

        <p>Well given I linked to my sources, I feel you should do the same. I am aware of studies being conducted using computer models and manikins, but none that show any real-world impact and many for other viruses that show no impact or even a negative impact (admittedly only one study).</p>
<p>So it's fine to contribute to the destruction of the environment because it's already going on? Cool!</p>
<p>I don't actually agree with the road safety hysteria we have going on - certainly in my country - so you picked a poor analogy. Much of it is of limited efficacy or is counter productive - much like masks! However, speed limits do not interfere with one of the most fundamental systems in the human body, whereas masks do restrict the respiratory system so masks are a much greater imposition than speed limits.</p>

        <p>Every single time that I've been confronted about not wearing a mask it's been a white female who looks just like that - maybe a little bit heavier, but nevertheless.   I shut it down immediately because I'm not masking up for anybody.   It would be nice to see more people without masks on but I'm usually the only one.</p>

        <p>I’m with you friend, I try to not wear it as much as possible but unfortunately in my area they literally have security guards enforcing it in all stores, malls, and even metro stations. </p>
<p>Funny story, a couple months ago I’m at the gym and confronted by a female staff member for having the mask under my chin when I was doing deadlifts. She starts telling me they’ve been watching me on camera and warning me they will kick me out if I don’t comply. When I tried to explain to her it’s hard to breathe with the mask, a swarm of muzzled Chad’s started to form and circle around me. One of them shouted some bullshit like “dude just put it on for fucks sake” and I just snapped, looked at him and said “come put it on my face bitch”. LOL the look on all those snowflakes faces when I said that and his only response was silence. Regardless I immediately terminated my membership then and there. The fact that we can’t even to go the gym without some social justice warrior nagging at you over a piece of cloth is unreal. Was everyone always deep down a Karen? Or did the new normal make them into one......</p>

        <p>One of the by-products of low O2/high Co2 to the brain is aggression.   People are mean. <br>
 I've been cursed at for not wearing a mask in a Walgreens but I'm still not going to wear one.  My employer (a gym) now demands a mask <em>plus</em> a filter for everyone - they refuse to acknowledge medical exemptions -   not gonna do it, so I'm not working there for now.   Over the summer,  I began to work on becoming self-employed and am now building my business.  There are so many people who don't have that option and it's a shame because the masks ruin the body's natural mechanism to stave off sickness.</p>

        <p>No it wasn’t. I saw where that meme and subsequent phrase originated. Suburban American soccer moms who ask to see the manager, with a specific bleach blonde undercut hairstyle. It’s a lucky coincidence that middle aged anti-vax women chose to exhibit that attitude. The name Karen stuck with it as every minimum wage worker has had an experience dealing with one. The popularity of names like Karen, Jennifer, Lisa, and Cheryl have plummeted since the last generation.</p>
<p>Memes aren’t a conspiracy, it’s the culture of the internet and often the voice of the proletariat.</p>

        <p>ironic that the fuckyoukaren sub has top posts all day long about people not wearing a mask. how is it that they turned into karens, not one post a week or day, multiple. they've become the very thing they sought to destroy. i take it the meme is a child hanging from the tree. meanwhile teachers across america ban together to keep inperson schools closed, so that they can continue to work from home. while suicide rates soar for children. come on man, they don't want to be your babbysitters. taken from oakley school teachers hot mic incident.</p>

        <p>Typically it’s “Karen’s” not wanting to wear masks. People in the sub are all over the place and have a very misconstrued view on reality. How is it that people can be so dense? God for fucking bid you have to wear a mask in a store. People like the ones in this sub are the reason we’re still dealing with all of this nonsense. Grow the fuck up.</p>

        <p>Honestly get fucked. I lost my job and stayed home. I did the 2 weeks which eventually turned into 300+ days without complaint.</p>
<p>I didn’t riot and scream BLM while burning down minority communities. I didn’t storm the capital. I like most, am just the average American. </p>

        <p>What does this have to do with BLM or the capitol riots? It seems your frustrations lie somewhere else, I’d suggest seeking some help from a professional instead of complaining on Reddit. Also not entirely sure where boot licking comes into play here, boot licking refers to an overt support for the military which I had mentioned nothing about. But again you and people like you are out of touch with reality, but go off I guess pal.</p>

        <p>The people who share similar ideologies to you such as not wanting change (which is the entire purpose of this subreddit) have time and time again refused to wear masks or do the things necessary to get covid over with have caused people to lose their lives. Maybe you haven’t directly or even indirectly killed anyone. But people who think like you certainly have.</p>

        <p>Ah yes it’s almost like those lockdowns did nothing to prevent any deaths, all they did was make the rich richer by forcing small business to close, and hurting average Americans by making us lose our jobs something you clearly can’t relate too</p>

        <p>Ah yes it’s almost as if the many countries across the world who had better procedures and more educated people who actually followed the things they needed to do were far better off than the US. But that’s right lockdowns don’t work and “NO NEW NORMAL!!” Kick rocks buddy, if the government telling you to wear a mask and stay home when possible is considered to far out of line for you, you should educate yourself on abortion rights and get outraged about that instead and then I’ll respect your insight on “government overreach”</p>

<p>Except they didn’t do that, they forced millions of small businesses to close, but again you wouldn’t know or care about that </p>

        <p>The trouble is you guys this kind of example only works going on the assumption that the coronavirus isn't as big a deal as as we are being told.
Now I know that is exactly what most of you believe and I do honestly respect that but you use derogatory and exaggerated examples of what 'the other side' are saying (sorry I'm not sure how groups with different opinions are labelling each other.) 
Actually what you're doing by using these over exaggerated examples is exactly what you're accusing the other side of doing ie being overly aggressive and morally questionable.
This is just my opinion for what It's worth.</p>
<p>I will say I think anyone that aggressively berates another person for not wearing a mask needs to wind their neck in and just walk around that person and carry on, tbh honest where I live most people are wearing masks in the supermarket for example with the odd person not wearing a mask I've seen nobody confront the non mask wearers.</p>
<p>Personally most people I know that go along with the government guidelines  would agree that it's not because we love the government  but it seems the most likely version of events to be true and if we saw something else that made more sense we would go with that.
I've had a few interactions with people on this sub I've yet to see any strong examples of  why I shouldn't listen to the government.
I hope you see this comment for what it is, it's not an attack on on anyone's beliefs.</p>
<p>Edit...As expected just get down votes, apparently memes are deemed more worthy than discussion on this sub.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply, It shows that we can agree on the fact that the fatality rate is low,I think most people knew this fairly soon into the pandemic.
The problem is that you and many others are missing the point, it's not just about death numbers, though I'd find it hard to say they don't matter,but the point is its very infectious and has the ability to make a large number of people sick to varying degrees,which shouldn't be played down considering what many have to go through before they recover and some left with scarred lungs etc.
My local hospital was using general wards as ICU facilities when the UK had a big peak just into the new year,so obvious implications there.</p>
<p>People like yourself look at the situation and say the restrictive measures are over the top because you don't see dead people everywhere, statistically there's a good chance you won't know anyone who's died.
But the way I see it is that means the restrictions are doing what they supposed to you i.e. keep the numbers down.
What if was left unchecked and 70% the world had it all at the same time? We would be fucked!
That's how myself and most people I know see it.</p>
<p>Edit ..I'm not saying you are wrong,I'm saying our definition of what's important are different.</p>

<p>I mean yes, when a virus has a low IFR it has a high R0.
The fact that for every case that gets recorded, there are ten more is actually a great thing because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It shows how mild this virus is that the vast majority of people don't even really get sick from contracting it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shows the IFR is extremely low...and along the lines of the annual flu. If a billion people get a respiratory virus and only 1 or 2 million of them die...that shows what it is...a highly contagious but mild virus, like any other mild respiratory virus humans have dealt with since our existence. </p>
</li>

<p>I'm not saying nothing should have been done. What has happened though, has been insane, in my own words. The nefarious media and its quacks have done nothing but feed misinformation and distort everything while playing dumb. Basic knowledge about respiratory viruses that they knew prior to March 2020, they suddenly pretend that they are baffled by or are only just now discovering. They've made the narrative that this is a magical alien supervirus that no one knows anything about (even after one year), as if this virus wasn't a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus... hardly anything enigmatic.</p>
<p>What has happened this year has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this one before?</p>
<p>What should have been done, was to simply advocate for handwashing and try to get as many people to boost their immune system (via regular exercise, healthy diets, limited substance use). </p>
<p>What they did was a complete reversal of that. They experimented with lockdowns (which have never been done before even for diseases far deadlier) that only caused collosal damage to every facet society by robbing children of education and social development and  collapsing the economy which contributed to even more deaths from starvation, suicides and overdoses. Please research the increases of all these deaths to see what I mean. It will then become undeniable that the response is magnidutes more deadly than the virus itself. </p>
<p>They also mandated masks even though numerous studies prior to March 2020 even from the CDC and the WHO themselves have shown masks to never be significantly effective at reducing transmission of respiratory viruses and asymptomatic transmission is virtually non-existent. It was also known that the small areas they showed any sort of effectiveness was when worn by people who were actually sick and symptomatic, though the level of effectiveness was not highly significant. These studies were all correct as we know have enough real time data to see that even though mask mandates were everywhere, cases were still surging for months non-stop.</p>
<p>They had healthy people stay inside and have them limit their sunlight and fresh air exposure (Vitamin D - which is vital in maintaining a healthy immune system so you can actually fight off viruses easily).</p>
<p>They even encouraged fastfood takeouts and home deliveries. Which is again, the opposite of boosting your immune system and staying healthy.</p>
<p>Everything concerning this virus is such a massive break from all protocol and sanity.</p>
<p>&rt;What if was left unchecked and 70% the world had it all at the same time?</p>
<p>This is actually impossible, because herd immunity kicks in long before that. Not even half the human population will get covid, (most likely only a fourth of the human population actually will).</p>
<p>By the time you even notice a highly contagious respiratory virus is there, it's already far too late to do anything to stop it even if you could...because by that time the virus has already taken hold and will at that point keep spreading until herd immunity is reached.</p>

        <p>So people who are suffering in the pandemic shouldn't have to wear protective gear to make the pandemic move along quicker?? Like wtf is the rationale to not wearing the mask?? You think you're making a statement?? Sticking it to the man?? Fighting the power?? Then what?? What's the end game?? Is the pandemic gonna just poof?? What are the moves that will offer solutions to the spread of the virus and make masks obsolete. What is better than a mask?? Why shouldn't I wear one??

<p>To continue living our lives. Take multivitamins, don't let yourself get overly fat. (Vitamin C &amp; D deficiency along with obesity are the biggest risk factors).</p>
<p>When we panicked at the beginning of last year, we had no idea that the virus had a survival rate comparable to the flu. </p>
<p>The media was getting clicks on anything covid-19 related though, so they kept making click bait headlines. </p>
<p>People kept buying into it, while at the same time politicians had a hayday with their new "emergency authority".</p>
<p>There's other factors that I'll go into as well if you're interested. To summarize though, <em>the virus just isn't that bad</em>.</p>

        <p>My uncle has it and it is THAT BAD. He's not even hooked up to a ventilator yet and he says nothing feels like how COVID is. It is NOT just a flu. Advice like this should be disqualified just as quickly as masks as well then cos it has no factual evidence backing its veracity and I can give first hand information backing that. Living life like we always did does nothing but offer you up to a lottery of not how but when cos it offers zero preventative solutions.</p>

<p>Haha awesome how if the advice doesn't work, the natural rebuttal is maybe you're just weak. Real nice. Neither of those statements are in the affirmative. He was a healthy 43 year old man with no underlying health conditions. Now he's a 43 year old man with COVID, which might leave him with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Doing nothing about it doesn't work. We need better solutions. Everything on new normal literally boils down to take this or do that, then wait and see. Literally everything. Which is as baffling as that mask shit</p>

<p>Every virus affects everyone differently. This isn't unique to some new variant of Covid, Flu, or anything else.</p>
<p>No matter how bad a virus gets, we shouldn't intrude on personal liberty. If someone knows they're sick, stay home, wear masks, sure. But <em>everyone?</em> It's a silly idea born of panic.</p>

        <p>Dr fauci said mask don't work they just make people "feel" safe.  The particles are flying out of your mask in all direction especially upwards to keep it in the air longer.  If anything they spread disease.  Since it causes you to touch your face more and traps falling particles from other dispshits wearing mask in it. Also lockdowns don't do shit.   And in general fearing mongering by making people wear mask and social distance is murderous.  Millions will die from missed cancer checks, obesity, diabetes, heart attacks from lack of immobility.  ODs, rising homicide and suicide.  People just aren't trying to stay healthy since what's the point?  That alone will kill wayyyy more than covid.  It's fucking common sense.</p>

        <p>Lol that isn't common sense. That's you, spinning a lot of bullshit around to fit what you want to believe. So Dr. Fauci says this, then he says that, and then the guy on Fox News says this, and this YouTuber says that... who are we supposed to listen to?!? See, THAT is where your own common sense is supposed to come into play. Does Covid-19 exist? Seems like it. Does Covid-19 kill people? Not everyone, but above 1%. Do we want those people to die? I mean, I don't know any of them, but not really. Are diseases commonly spread through particles exhaled from the mouth? Well, studies from the 1910's would show that. Would wearing a small peice of fabric across your mouth stop random spit and detritis from flying out of it? Well duh. If particles of spit contaminated with Covid-19 are coming out of my mouth into the air, is there a lesser chance of me spreading it to other people? Well that makes sense. Have epidemics, endemics, and pandemics happened all over the world for thousands of years throughout human civilization and we've figured out how and why they happen and we should be better prepared to handle it? Yes. But half of us don't want to handle it because human beings are stubborn children apparently. Have I missed anything? If somebody would have asked little me 20 years ago how to handle a situation like this, I would have most likely suggested something very similar. Wear masks, gloves, and stay the fuck away from each other for a little bit. But it couldn't just be that easy, could it? People had to kick and scream and cry about it. New Zealand handled that shit great because they did exactly what they should have. They used their brains. There's some little islands floating around in the middle of the ocean whose population is ivy leagues smarter than "the most powerful nation in the world" and that is so fucking sad and embarrassing.</p>

        <p>When you talk about New Zealand your argument is totally invalidated. Besides the fact that you fail to understand the United States is in no way comparable to that country for a multitude of reasons, and therefore would not have the same outcome, you also fail to realize they still have cases despite all of those measures. So they’ve ruined their economy for nothing.</p>

        <p>Imagine spending 10 years in getting a masters degree, then earning a PHd, then spending your life to become a leading authority in virology, just to have some Karen that barely squeaked by community college to become a receptionist at State Farm for $10/hr tell you that your a moron, and a liar, and your a shill for the government, and you have no idea what your talking about because she spent a few evenings watching conspiracy videos on youtube and she's in a Facebook group where they all watched the same video and they all agree with each other... I'd probably just retire.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’m sure wearing a mask causes people to commit suicide. This is a stupid post, and if wearing cloth covering your mouth and nose causes you to have suicidal feelings you should go see a therapist. This is making a mockery of anybody with genuine suicidal feelings.</p>

        <p>That isn't what this picture is about at all. It's satire, obviously. But it's depicting someone killing themselves because they lost everything due to lockdowns and forced closures of business and instead of being horrified by what she sees, some Karen is yelling at him about a mask. The picture is about people's crazy obsession with masks to the point where someone could be dead in front of them and they are mad about a mask.</p>

        <p>You’re right, it’s not all about wearing a mask, it’s about being a good fucking person and trying to keep others safe. I find it ironic that somebody who’s vocal against wearing masks, and presumably social distancing and lockdowns as well, is lecturing <em>me</em> on compassion. I’m not a saint, but there’s no way that a person such as you who willingly endangers other’s lives cares more than me about people in general.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I’m unsure if you’re playing dumb or you just don’t understand. Your own post <em>only</em> references wearing masks, thus, my sarcastic comment only references wearing masks as well. I am in no way privileged - I’m not Middle or Upper class - so I don’t know why you felt to bring that into your response despite it being wholly incorrect.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s not only about the masks, you always have to social distance and occasionally participate in lockdowns. Those, in turn, can cause stress or mental issues, obviously. However that doesn’t give you the right to be a selfish prick and not wear masks, and not heed social distancing requirements. <em>Everyone</em> hates these lockdowns, but unlike the majority of the people in these subs, we at least have the common decency to wear a fucking mask, the intellect to realize that the government isn’t trying to sabotage us and kill us all (so we should probably follow what they say, generally), and the understanding that not complying can cause illness and death.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should look for other things to help you in this trying time. People who wear masks are not your enemy, nor should they be, they simply wish for you to not reckless endanger yourself and others. Look for other alternatives. Your therapist isn’t seeing someone? Find an online one. Call your friends everyday, FaceTime with your family members. Join local communities (preferably ones that don’t incite people to not wear safety devices). There are alternatives, and maybe if you stopped crying about wearing a mask you can find some.</p>

        <p>I know, thank you! My word, it feels like I lose intelligence every time I go on this subreddit. Notice how nobody has responded back to my arguments? They don’t have any ground to stand on, whether moral or scientific. Some of them even had the gall - as anti-maskers - to tell me I lacked empathy. Nice to see friendly people on here every now and again.</p>
