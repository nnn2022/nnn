    <strong>Worried about another lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>Hi (21M) I moved into student rooms the other day to get away from toxic family. I'm strongly anti lockdown and very sceptical of the whole global situation. I don't want to take this vaccine either, I have taken vaccines for the flu because it was recommended by doctors for my heart condition when I was younger.</p>
<p>I'm really worried when there's another lockdown or when the government impose laws as such when you don't take the vaccine I can't stay in my accomodation or go to uni physically. Like a two-tier society.  I've nowhere else to live :( - my mental state due to toxic family is so so low right now I had to talk to a support line yesterday</p>
<p>Any advice?</p></p>
