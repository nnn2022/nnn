        <p>The fact that they can say the vaccines are “safe and effective” without being able to prove it is maddening. Meanwhile any info on Ivermectin is strictly prohibited. </p>
<p>You simply can’t say the vaccines are safe with no long term data to back it up. Why is that not labeled “medical misinformation”?</p>

        <p>They've published the safety data for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. For the Pfizer one, the phase II/III safety data was evaluated in over 43,000 people before it was approved for emergency use by the FDA.</p>
<p>In general, vaccines don't have adverse events after more than a couple of months, so based on current scientific knowledge this vaccine is safe. So it's not 'medical misinformation'.</p>

        <p>It's new technology in regards to production and deployment. But the nature of the vaccines themselves, the fact that they're mRNA vaccines, remains established safe vaccine tech. The end result of these vaccines are not much different from prior mRNA vaccines: the vaccine triggers your body to make spike proteins that your body can then use to detect and destroy this particular virus early on in the infection process so that you don't actually become "infected", and hence: 95% immunity. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We know that spike proteins don't persist indefinitely in the body and we know that spike proteins don't spontaneously change and warp into something dangerous or harmful after some time. So to say "what are the long term effects" is to imply that somehow, after 5-10 years, whatever your designation of "long-term" is, these spike proteins will still somehow persist in the body AND that they're going to spontaneously change into something dangerous (which has never happened, ever). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For one to claim that this is different and unsafe compared to other vaccines, one would also have to make the claim that everything we know about vaccines in general, spike proteins, virology, immunology, epidemiology, and cell biology is wrong, and that's a lofty claim to make; a claim that a scientific, free-thinking, knowledgeable, well-researched individual would NOT make unless they had an larger mountain of evidence than the one the science community currently has.</p>

        <p>They've been working on this type of vaccine for 15 or so years. So it's new for mass use, but has been used experimentally for quite a while.</p>
<p>I'm curious why you think there would be unknown effects from the mRNA vaccines?  Our bodies already make mRNA all the time as part of normal cellular functions, and as part of replication process for several types of viruses.  They've just figured out how to direct that for something useful. And they've figured out how to manufacture and transport the mRNA.... RNA is notoriously difficult to keep intact because they are lots of enzymes that will degrade it.  There's nothing here that suggests there would be any adverse events due to the use of mRNA. Scientists have estimated the half life of mRNA in human cells, and it's something like 10-12 hours, so relatively short, supporting that mRNA is not likely to hang around for a long time, so it's not available to cause problems.</p>

        <p>How "long" is your requirement for "long" term data? 1 year? 5 years? 10? 20? Are you this skeptical about other drugs/treatments brought to market? There are PLENTY of studies and trials that have shown the efficacy and safety of these vaccines, you just choose not to look at the science because you're setting some impossible goalpost. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Think about this: take your special requirements for this particular vaccine and apply it to any number of other vaccines/medications that have been brought to market in the past 10 years, are any of them capable of passing your arbitrary goalpost?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We're now 1 year out from the widespread release and use of the vaccines, would it not be reasonable to say now, since millions have gotten it and it's been more than a year, that we can say that they're "Safe and effective"?</p>

        <p>This is such a low effort reply. Lol. Guess what? The “Often” in your quoted text means not always. So yes this vaccine’s timeframe is different than others because the infectious ness and nature of the disease necessitated an accelerated timeframe. </p>
<p>I dunno why you quoted that like it’s some sort of “gotcha”. other vaccines don’t warrant having the resources of hundreds of countries, hundreds of thousands of people, billions of dollars thrown at its research and thus takes a longer time. </p>
<p>Just because they achieved this in unprecedented time doesn’t mean that it’s not safe or that it’s ineffective. The data would show that. The data shows that it is safe and effective so the timeframe doesn’t matter.</p>

        <p>mrna vaccines have been studied for other diseases since the 90s, so scientists have some understanding of long term side effects. The truth is, there are far more unknowns with the long term side effects in covid survivors than there are with the vaccine. We're still discovering the extent of the damage to the lungs, heart, and brain that could be permanent due to covid, and that's being discovered in asymptomatic people as well. Scientists understand the technology of the vaccine and feel extremely confident that there is a very small chance that there would be long term side effects, and if there are they are likely to be minor issues. But we certainly don't have the medical technology to reverse permanent damage to our vital organs in the 1.6million (and counting) covid survivors in the world.</p>

        <p>A sheep is someone who believes without doing due research. Most of us here have researched and read reports and listened to scientists on both sides. That makes us free thinkers. I'm perfectly willing to change my mind, but first you need to disprove the beneficial effects of the immune system, vitamin D, fasting, exercise, healthy eating, etc.</p>

<p>So many here claim there are other drugs which are effective in treating COVID 19. These pharmaceutical companies spent many millions researching, developing and manufacturing the vaccines that are now in circulation. If HCQ was already an effective treatment, why not just manufacture and sell that by the truckload? Why bother creating an entirely new treatment when they could just sell already established drugs and make even greater profit (as it would have cut out the research costs)?</p>

        <p>They don’t own the rights to ivermectin or HCQ those are off brand drugs anyone in the world can acquire these without a prescription. </p>
<p>Here are the reasons why companies didn’t use Alternatives.  off the top of my head</p>
<p>1 they wouldn’t be able to charge other countries for the use of off brand drugs.  </p>
<p>2 the supply would force them to sell these drugs at market cost. If USA was selling ivermectin for $100 but every other country in the world had it for $2 then no one would get treated in he USA.</p>
<p>3 it’s not there own manufactured drug so pharmaceutical companies wouldn’t get the no liability and they wouldn’t be able to be sole proprietors of a cure for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Exactly. With a functioning immune system thanks to those things you don't need a shot for a glorified flu virus.</p>
<p>&rt;But let me ask you this...what do you believe is the reason behind all of this? Lockdowns, the vaccine, everything?</p>
<p>Money, control, and in rare instances where this is not the case, the (small) government is just following the other (big) governments so they don't look bad.</p>

<p>As for control and power, there are plenty here who say governments don't care about us. I agree completely.</p>
<p>In fact, they care so little, they have no need to control us. As long as we're paying taxes, they're happy.</p>

        <p>Prove your point. </p>
<p>All it would take is any proof of your claims. As it stands, 309 million in the us alone have been vaccinated. Of those vaccinated, .00017% have still gotten covid and died. Of those 309 million, 3 have died as a direct result of the vaccine, a number smaller than the daily likelihood of dying while slipping in the shower, being attacked by a cow, or driving. </p>
<p>So, please provide your data indicating the danger of the vaccine vs the danger of covid. </p>
<p>We know many of the short and long term dangers about covid. We know many of the short and long term data about the various types of vaccines. It’s called scientific inference.</p>

<p>They're tools to help the immune system, dummy, don't need to busy the immune system with fighting a sickness if the sickness never makes it inside you.</p>
<p>Immunocompromised people don't even leave the house because no amount of gloves or masks will make you truly immune.</p>
<p>Vaccines are meant to instruct the immune system to fight a new type of sickness so that the immune system is prepared and knows what to do if you catch it. It's basically a seminar and training camp to prepare for new hostile technology so that your troops know what to do when they run into it in the field. If you had no immune system at all, vaccines wouldn't work, because there's nothing to instruct.</p>

        <p>You’re ignoring the last part of the sentence: “with zero mid to long term safety studies”. 
Which is true, there aren’t any of these studies on the covid vaccines because they’re new. Why anyone thinks it’s a bad thing to want to wait and see the long term effects of a new medical injection is beyond logic to me.</p>

        <p>The covid vaccines are based on preexisting coronaviral vaccines with mountains of testing and research to back them up, of course we can't have waterproof long term studies specifically for this, but vaccine safety is something taken extremely seriously. For proof, consider astrazeneca, which was recalled and stopped after only a handful of people experienced clotting as a side effect so that they could do further testing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then there's the question of motivation, even from a purely monetary perspective it makes zero sense to roll out a potentially fatal vaccine worldwide where you skimped out on the proper safety tests. For example, imagine you own a pharmaceutical company, you just developed a vaccine for covid-19 and decide to roll it out immediately without being sure of the side effects. It turns out, your vaccine is dogshit and has a really, really high chance of giving people narcolepsy. What happens to your business in the slightly longer term? You tarnish your name, you get sued, you lose the trust of your consumers, you bleed money.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense for anyone to roll out potentially fatal vaccines on a massive, world-spanning scale. Thus, it's more likely that they have passed the rigorous safety checks involved.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Besides, the point of the post isn't that last part of the sentence; it's the "replacing your immune system" mantra, which is possibly the single dumbest shit antivaxxers peddle.</p>

        <p>It's a bad thing to wait because waiting another week, month, year, or decade isn't going to suddenly change this vaccine from "safe and effective" to "unsafe and ineffective".  We have mountains of data on the efficacy and safety of this vaccine, that's unlikely to change. The fact remains that the mid to long term effects of catching this virus is significantly more studied and worse than any potential for "mid to long term safety concerns". </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>By waiting, you're still at risk of being infected, of passing on that infection to others who are at risk (some young child with cancer or some grandmother on immunosuppressants or any number of other immunocompromised people). Not only do you risk your health and the lives of others, you risk the virus mutating in your body (since you didn't successfully prevent infection and eradication via the vaccine), and becoming a slightly different virus with a slightly different spike protein for which the current mRNA vaccines do not work. Guess what that means? By waiting, you risk becoming patient zero and the start of an entirely new, preventable pandemic. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm young and healthy and don't have any comorbidities, I couldn't care less about being infected because the chance of me suffering from the virus are slim to none. I'm vaccinated and still wear masks in indoor public spaces...why? because i don't want the one in a million chance that i'm somehow infected, presymptomatic, and spread it to some poor old grandma doing her weekly grocery trip and killing her. Herd immunity will only be achieved if everyone has a "be your brother's keeper" mentality.</p>

        <p>I disagree. It’s bad to tell someone to take a drug they aren’t comfortable taking because they are selfish if they don’t. It’s not bad for someone to say they aren’t comfortable with current data and they want to wait for more data or an alternative. I understand your argument, but I disagree with the premise. The minute you start vilifying someone based on their own bodily autonomy is the minute you become the baddie.</p>

        <p>Do you believe in mandatory vaccinations for schools? DTAP, MMR, those vaccines? This isn't much different than that. </p>
<p>In order to participate in a free and functioning society, one has to accept certain tenets and conditions that are set forth for the greater good of society. I believe in the right to free speech, but even that has its limits. You can't yell out "fire!" in a crowded theater because it can incite harm from the ensuing panic. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Similarly, there are situations in which your bodily autonomy is limited when it comes to the possibility of harming someone else, in the name of the greater good of society. We have laws against drunk driving even if you can frame a "bodily autonomy" counter argument:  "well it's my body, and my car, I get to dictate whether I can drive drunk or not".  </p>
<p>I never vilified those unwilling to vaccinate. If you're steadfastly arguing against the mountain of scientific evidence, it's perfectly within your right to express yourself and be wrong. But then you have to accept that while you're walking around unvaccinated you ARE a potential vector for spread of a deadly disease, much more so than your vaccinated neighbors. If you choose to get the vaccine and are somehow harmed by it, against the mountain of evidence, the most you can hurt is 1 person, yourself. If you choose not to get the vaccine and disregard the mountain of evidence in doing so, you can spread the disease to countless others, and they themselves to countless others. That is the definition of selfish, "arising from concern with one's own welfare or advantage in disregard of others". You're worried about harm to yourself from the vaccine whilst not being worried about the potential spread and harm to others if you don't vaccinate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If antivaccers would voluntarily agree to:</p>
<ol>
<li>not be treated for COVID in a hospital setting should they happen to catch it (because they then would take up a respirator, ventilator, hospital man hours and resources that could have otherwise gone to someone who DID follow all the recommendations and still caught it )</li>
<li>not be out in public unmasked</li>
<li>maintain strict social distancing at all times whilst in public</li>
<li>be liable if they're found to be patient zero for a local covid hotspot</li>
</ol>
<p>Then by all means, go ahead and stay unvaccinated, as is your right. But if you're going to spit in the face of science and medicine and disregard the mountains of evidence in lieu of "well, there's simply not enough evidence for me to be sure", you better be damn sure to come up with a mountain of evidence to support your skepticism. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, this whole "you're the villains for telling me to do something I don't wanna do" argument doesn't pass muster, like at all. We're not telling cancer patients they HAVE to do chemotherapy or radiation. If they opt not to do so, it's perfectly within their rights to not do so...because it doesn't harm anyone but themselves if they do. Once your "choice" can harm countless others, it becomes much more than just a "personal choice". If you "choose" not to do something as simple as getting a couple of needle sticks and you get sick and say infect your family or friends or even some random person you don't know, whatever happens to them is ABSOLUTELY on you and your choices and your conscience (if you have one).</p>
