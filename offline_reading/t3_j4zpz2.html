    <strong>Life is for the living</strong>
    <p><p>I was in my senior year of college when cooties hit. At the time, I went along with the lockdown because I believed this would just temporary, only for a few weeks while we learned more about the disease. Boy was I wrong! Now here we are 6 months after the lockdowns were started and the numbers do not justify the restrictions. Now, the media only brings up daily new cases and sometimes the overall death count (especially to blame it on Trump). For the sake of argument, let's assume the numbers are not inflated. It still doesn't change the fact for anyone that isn't elderly and relatively healthy, this disease has over a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>So why are these restrictions still in place? Because it's about control. And it's worked, so many people fell in line with it and now cheer for this crap. I feel so alone, many people I know follow these rules to a T and I know how they would treat me if I said this is BS. The restrictions don't even make sense. 2020 was supposed to be the year that I became self-sustaining and start my career. Now I'm still living at home and working at a car dealership so I can still make some money while trying to figure out how I get a job in my field in this economy with zero experience.</p>
<p>My main point is I'm angry and upset by how I'm a bad guy for questioning these restriction, for not being able to start my career, and the absolute loneliness I feel everyday knowing how I would be treated by people I thought cared about me if I bring up my concerns.</p></p>

        <p>I love that you call it cooties lol. I hope you don’t mind if I steal that.</p>
<p>But yes, I’m in total agreement with you. People have absolutely lost their minds. In my provinces subreddit, I was blamed for someone else not seeing their family because I’m choosing to go out and see mine. And I’m the one insane? </p>
<p>I wonder what it’s like to live in perpetual fear.</p>

        <p>I know. I think it's such bullshit that this stuff is still going on. Personally, at this point, I believe that this is all political. I could be wrong, but I think (at least in the US), the tide is going to be turning over the next three months. People have lost enough, I don't think they're going to sit idly by, and just miss out on the holidays. People will gather with loved ones, just like they always do, and this crap will crumble!</p>
