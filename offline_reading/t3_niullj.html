    <strong>Unpopular Opinion: On average, most people don't care about this pandemic, they just want it over with.</strong>
    <p><p>I think the worst part of this entire pandemic has been having yet another polarizing issue to divide society over. Its frustrating to say the least. While I know some people will never take off their masks, I truly feel that they're in the minority. All of the conspiracy theories out now is exhausting to think about.</p>
<p>Granted, my experience will differ than what others have experienced across the US (and rest of the world) but I've watched most people just go about their business doing the best they can.</p>
<p>I think the greatest example of this is the corporations/ businesses implementing masks at establishments... they want people to feel they're doing something and not alienate any customers. And while I am sure some will say "Fuck masks and those pussies!" That doesn't help said business stay afloat. And thats the only thing a business owner cares about... its bottom line..</p>
<p>I work in a climbing gym in the US in an industrial park. We implemented masks and required people sign a waiver. My boss admittedly was worried about one thing: his business and his customers. He couldn't be bothered by what else is going on.</p>
<p>Our business is booming like the pandemic never happened. The demographics of our patrons is large, most people want to just come in and climb and escape the craziness of the world. </p>
<p>I'm pro do whatever you want. I think most (but obviously not all) Americans are the same. There is a lot of blame being levied toward different groups but the reality is poor leadership at every level got us where we are. If you think vaccine passports are going to be a thing, take off your tin foil hat, go outside, get some maskless fresh air, and wait for the next crisis the 24-hour new cycle stirs up.</p></p>

        <p>The climbing gyms here enforce mask wearing while climbing. Place has never been so empty- everyone’s just going up rock faces and trees here now.</p>
<p>But yeah most people just don’t want to be that guy and want an easy life</p>

        <p>Excellent take! I think you’re right on the money. In my state, masks are optional everywhere you go and nobody is verifying anybody’s vaccine status. It’s 50/50 or so regarding people wearing masks and I believe that more and more will take off their masks as cases continue to decline during the summer. I couldn’t care less about anybody’s vaccination status and if I happen to go into a store that requires a mask, I’ll wait until an employee asks me to put one on, and I’ll do so because they have every right to require it. Things are trending in the right direction in the US (with the exception of Oregon) and I am optimistic for the future. Now we just need states to limit governor’s powers for things like this in the future and we’ll be more prepared if something like this comes along.</p>
