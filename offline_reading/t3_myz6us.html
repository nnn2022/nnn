    <strong>I'm still troubled by the official flu and coronavirus numbers.</strong>
    <p><p>How is it possible that two diseases, both spread by aerosolized droplets, had such radically different responses to the interventions of masking, distancing, and lockdowns? Have you ever heard of two diseases having radically different responses to hand washing?</p>
<p>Even if we allow for differences in the minimum infectious virions per droplet, and biological factors like cell adhesion and infiltration, the numbers aren't lining up.</p>
<p>So the most conservative estimate of flu cases for 2019-2020 flu season is 31,000,000 (largest is 50 million). Reducing that to 5000 means masks, social distancing, and lockdowns reduced influenza by 99.98%</p>
<p>There were supposedly 30 million coronavirus cases in the same timeframe as the 5000 flu cases. Since we don't have past data for coronavirus, let's use our most generous estimate, and say that without those same interventions, every one of the 330,000,000 people in the US would have been infected. The most effective masks, distancing, and lockdowns could have been was roughly 90% reduction in coronavirus transmission (masks are likely much less effective, but we're going with the most forgiving estimate)</p>
<p>So, same method of transmission, same interventions, and influenza gets reduced by 99.98%, and coronavirus gets reduced by AT MOST 90%.</p>
<p>So.... Is coronavirus 500x more transmissible than influenza? That doesn't agree with the official estimates of influenza having an r naught close to 1 and coronavirus being 2-4 times more transmissible with an r naught of 2-4.</p>
<p>The CDC numbers aren't even internally consistent.</p>
<p>Doomers, make it make sense.</p></p>

        <p>I think about this alot too.  There are two theories that make things make sense.</p>
<p>1) Simultaneous co-infection of COVID and influenza.  Early data out of Wuhan showed that most of the COVID deaths had simultaneous co-infection of COVID and influenza.  But current protocols in the west are to test for COVID first and if positive then tests for other viruses stop.  </p>
<p>2) Viral interference.  This one is much hyped as a reason, but I'm not sure about it. </p>
<p>Of course, simply rebranding the flu as COVID is the most likely cause of this.  But admitting that our entire health system has become corrupt is hard to do.</p>

        <p>The simplest answer, for me, is that the PCR test was bad for most of 2020 and dramatically inflated the number of false positives. Technicians let the thermocycler run until it came up positive. Ask any undergraduate lab assistant about letting a thermocycler run for 40 cycles.</p>
<p>"In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.
On Thursday, the United States recorded 45,604 new coronavirus cases, according to a database maintained by The Times. If the rates of contagiousness in Massachusetts and New York were to apply nationwide, then perhaps only 4,500 of those people may actually need to isolate and submit to contact tracing."</p>

        <p>As you should be. Low flu numbers does not confirm mask and distancing works. It confirms we are being lied to.</p>

        <p>Its called viral interference.  Doomers will say OMG our holy masks and washing of the hands ended the flu. But no google viral interference or viral competition.  Basically if you are infected with one virus certain others can't infect you.  Since COVID has a higher R0 than the flu it's going to outcompete it spreading to others.</p>

        <p>As far as I can tell, Viral interference has only been shown in prokaryotes where the viral DNA literally crowds out other competing viral DNAs in the host genome.</p>
<p>I see that there is an theory in multicellular organisms that interferon is responsible, but I find that hard to believe that was the case for Rona. I don't think you could have simultaneously asymptomatic transmission AND interferon response. Interferon is pretty intense stuff. They though it was a miracle cure back when it was first identified, and then when they started injecting it into people, their immune systems went into overdrive (i.e. inflammation) and nearly killed them. It's likely that interferon is what gives you the symptoms of being sick in the first place. You're definitely NOT asymptomatic, but also experiencing interferon-based viral interference.</p>

<p>Rhinovirus limited infection of COVID in human bronchial cells.  Obviously just an in vitro study but if true Covid could have the same effect on the flu.</p>

        <p>It doesnt have anything to do with mitigation, its viral interference and cross immunity.  When they are circulating at the same time it can make it difficult for both to be successful. The more deadly flus use some of the same receptors and cleaving enzymes that Covid does.</p>

        <p>I haven't checked the numbers in awhile, but my understanding was that some percentage of flu each year is Influenza Like Illnesses (ILIs) that are untested cases of symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat etc. Those are all coded to covid now.</p>
<p>So I'd expect to see basically no ILIs on FluView but the same-ish humber of positive, tested flu cases.</p>
<p>Are your numbers definite positive flu only or does it include ILIs?</p>

        <p>I don't know, they're the CDC's numbers, which I think are a variety of methods like positive tests and waste monitoring.</p>

        <p>I don't think those numbers are from the ILI database.  The WHOs statistics of near zero is the same in nearly every country too.</p>
