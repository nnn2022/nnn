    <strong>The American public's obsession with masking and vaccination to stay safe from COVID mostly boils down to laziness and a need for instant gratification</strong>
    <p><p>The public obsession with masks and vaccination makes perfect sense, and not even from a conspiratorial standpoint.</p>
<p>Americans want "fast-food" everything - they believe that if it can't be done in under ten minutes with minimal effort, it's not worth doing.</p>
<p>That is what masks and these vaccines promise - health in under ten minutes with minimal effort.</p>
<p>Rather than use lockdown time to exercise, learn to cook/eat healthy, and lose weight over a period of several months (which would greatly lower their risk from COVID and pretty much everything else as well,) most Americans decided to do fuck-all besides lay on their couches and pray that a mask or a vaccine would keep them safe.</p>
<p>While there definitely is a highly-suspicious pushing of these anti-COVID measures, the widespread public support for them cannot be denied. </p>
<p>(As a side note, I believe that there is something majorly wrong with the often coercive promotion of these measures. Before anyone calls me a shill, they should read my post and comment history.)</p>
<p>It would appear that over 60% of Americans have been vaccinated at least once, and many who have been vaccinated continue to mask. The rather strong public support here is not surprising. </p>
<p>Most Americans are incredibly short-sighted and lazy, and the only way they will ever care about their health is if those in power promise them an improvement that requires no long-term personal involvement. </p>
<p>That is why masking and vaccination were such easy sells in America; many of us can't be bothered to do anything more to maintain our health.</p></p>

        <p>It's not an American Public issue. The MSM headlines are very misleading. The majority of the US is unvaccinated and clearly don't want it. </p>
<p>The obsession is due to the majority getting all of the media, but presented very skewed.</p>

        <p>There are treatments that could have gotten us out of this the "fast food" way as well.  Ivermectin, Zinc+HCQ, etc.  So there had to be a coordinated effort to diss and bury these treatments in order to create a perceived need for masks, lockdowns, and eventually the kill shot.</p>

        <p>To be fair, I think lockdowns made a lot of people depressed and that had more to do with the laying on the couch thing than pure laziness. Depression sucks.</p>
