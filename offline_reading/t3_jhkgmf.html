    <p><p>Really, that’s it.  I appreciate not being banned for voicing opinions that go against this sub’s ostensible set of beliefs.  Either the mods are asleep entirely or they are decent mods.  I hope it’s the latter.</p></p>

        <p>It would be awesome if you could post this compliment on r/coronavirus and ask if the mods would consider getting some treatment for their censorship addiction.</p>
<p>People on that sub have been banned for posting articles from peer reviewed journals, CDC stats from the govt’s own website, WHO statements, etc. Alll because it doesn’t fit a pre-determined narrative. </p>
<p>I’m sure you’re a member of that sub. How do you feel about their censorship of civil, thoughtful, science-based posts?</p>

        <p>Man.  I’ve thought pretty long and hard about to answer this.  The thing is that I don’t want to put myself in the position of defending anything but the moderation of this sub.  Frankly, I don’t want to come across as well-disguised propaganda meant to popularize this sub.  </p>
<p>I’m subscribed to this sub because I am firmly against it.  I do not want to elevate it, I just wanted to thank the mods and I feel like trying to post this over there will backfire on me.  I don’t know.  Does that make sense?</p>
<p>I feel bad though because yeah it would be nice if people saw your sub in a more positive light in terms of the honest dialog that goes on.  Because the mods facilitate it.  But apart from that I am firmly r/ProNewNormal until there is a vaccine.</p>
<p>Edit: ok that inspired me to make that sub.  r/ProNewNormal is a thing.  And for its first submission, I shall cross post this post.</p>
<p>Edit2: I can’t cross post?</p>

        <p>You misunderstand me. I don’t care what you think of this sub. But if you admire that the mods don’t censor you just for not fitting the narrative, you should tell the r/coronavirus sub that blunt censorship of even thoughtful and WELL-SOURCED posts is bullshit and it’s anti-intellectual and anti-science.</p>
<p>You don’t even have to mention this sub. Just tell them to quit calling information “low quality” and worthy of censorship when it’s merely information that doesn’t fit their narrative.</p>

I don’t have the time or mental energy to verify what you say, that the posts in question were actually thoughtful and well sourced.  And I am not going to act as an ambassador for your cause.</p>

        <p>From my comment above (this is why I  worry you struggle with comprehension): </p>
<p>“You don’t even have to mention this sub. Just tell them to quit calling information “low quality” and worthy of censorship when it’s merely information that doesn’t fit their narrative.” </p>
<p>Or simply start a conversation about what they censor, and why. </p>
<p>At any rate. I find you self righteous and self congratulating, and not intellectually honest or particularly interesting. It would be terrific if you moved your efforts to your shiny new sub. Head on over there, bro. Make it happen!</p>

        <p>I do not think we will be going back to any form of old normal after the vaccine even though I hope for it so what is your position on that? Do you feel like if we don’t get some sort of normalcy back by that time they’ve gone too far? Or would you still be content with the decision to remain in”new normal”?</p>

        <p>I have a FB friend -- a colleague in larger professional circles, we both have similar training which includes some epidemiology -- and he has fairly different views from mine on quarantine/lockdown.  However, I generally "like" his posts because they acknowledge the great socioeconomic and psychological harm caused by the lockdowns, while still advocating for masks and social distancing.</p>
<p>His assumption, different from mine but still based on data, is that the potential harm from the coronavirus justify the harm caused by lockdown, that the tradeoffs are worth it.  I disagree with his assumptions because I weight the existing data differently than he does, plus I have a worldview that frames things somewhat differently than his does.  However, I respect the nuance he brings and the acknowledgment that different views are possible.</p>
<p>I can respect people that disagree with me, even on really important issues, as long as the respect is returned and we can acknowledge the nuance and grey area that exists in discussions about complicated subjects.</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar situation, some of my colleagues have taken a pro-lockdown attitude although we agree on most of the data. The major difference is that they are over optimistic about the efficacy of preventive measures while at the same time being overly optimistic about the chances of getting and distributing a working vaccine. I would have agreed if two conditions were met: 1. lockdowns had worked within the promised two weeks, and 2. there was already a vaccine (it's been 10 months).</p>

        <p>there is no "type of person" idk how or when COVID became so political but im guessing your an American.</p>
<p>Remeber at the start of COVID right wingers were the ones for the lockdown closing borders, probably fueled by xenophobia. as it progressed left wingers became the ones that were all for lockdowns and closing borders, fueled by the media's fear mongering and the communal thinking  of "for our safety" "keep grandmam safe"</p>
<p>i was on this since january reading the news daily r/coronavirus and all that shit when no one gave a flying fuck and i was terrified, wanted to buy a gas mask i thought the movie "contagion" would become non-fiction. but i have totally flipped since then and hopefully you will too.</p>

        <p>Covid became political in the US after Trump wasn't impeached by the Senate. Remember that a Coronavirus didn't ruin the economy, lockdowns and grinding everything to a halt destroyed the economy. If trump was removed from office I don't think they're would ever have been such a push to lockdown the entire country. If the economy was still booming right now, it would have been impossible to even pretend to believe you could beat him at the polls.</p>

        <p>I think here in the US it sure did because there were plenty of articles, Dr. Fauci included writing them in the NEJM, etc saying this is not a problem, don't worry about it, worry more about influenza, then the impeachment faltered and things started going a bit nuts. That timing, along with the CCP propaganda online, pushed the cart on wheels hard and fast. (No. I am no Trump supporter.)</p>

        <p>But the entire world is dealing with COVID.  If this were merely some plot to fuck with Trump it certainly got out of control rather quickly, and if it somehow was then it wasn’t a very good plan.  If anything it was handing Trump re-election on a silver platter if he had actually even tried at all to beat the virus, like the PM of NZ who just rode her success into re-election.</p>

        <p>Covid is definitely a thing and could have been taken seriously without locking down at all. Quarantine and containment are not effective for mitigation after a virus has already spread everywhere. It's alarming how the world is lockstep in blatant authoritarianism, it is only deemed acceptable because they say everyone else is also taking these measures as well.

<p>It sure could have been.  However, the public failed to take this virus seriously.  How exactly does one “take a virus seriously” without attempting to quarantine and contain it?</p>
<p>&rt;It's alarming how the world is lockstep in blatant authoritarianism, it is only deemed acceptable because they say everyone else is also taking these measures as well. </p>
<p>Well when there is a novel virus spreading throughout the world and killing an inordinate amount of people and we all have no idea how to stop it or about it’s long-term consequences, authoritarian measures are necessary if you actually want to stop the virus from infecting everyone.  The entire world is at war with this virus and the smart countries are taking authoritarian war-time measures to keep their people safe.</p>
<p>&rt;Why didn't the world lockdown for swine flu? CDC estimated that we had 60 million cases in the US alone in the first year of that outbreak.</p>
<p>Swine flu really was “just another flu.”  It’s literally a strain of the flu.  H1N1.  It may have been slightly more deadly than the average flu, but it’s not like it killed more people than other bad seasons of the flu.  It is literally “swine influenza.”</p>
<p>We’re talking about ~10k deaths over a year’s time, and that was with no locking down, no mask mandates, etc.  Meanwhile, with covid we are nearing 250k deaths and we will certainly exceed that by the end of the year, <strong>WITH LOCKDOWNS AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES IN PLACE</strong>.  I haven’t socialized since fucking march, and neither have a whole lot of other people.  We didn’t lock down for swine flu because it would be like locking down for a new strain of the flu.  </p>
<p>We don’t do that because we can handle a new strain of the flu.  It doesn’t overwhelm our healthcare system.  We monitor its strains and we target vaccines at the strains that we predict will be the most prevalent.  Best we had for the coronavirus when it popped up was some SARS research that got shoved into a filing cabinet somewhere a few years back.  No known treatment.  No vaccine.  Our hospitals being overwhelmed (do you ever recall the flu overwhelming any of our hospitals?).  And a lot of people dying, people of all ages and even people who we believed were perfectly healthy before contracting the virus.  Yes it’s killing mostly the weakest among us but it’s killing a lot more of them than other viruses and it is also even killing some of our strongest, and we have no vaccine or effective treatment apart from your own individual immune system.</p>

        <p>I love this sub. Its my life line. One thing I like is it is not dogmatic like others. You do see differing viewpoints. There is so much "You disagree with me, you worship satan" mentality on Reddit in general that it makes it hard to have any faith left in humanity. There are other subs too that are good  but on speaking out against Covid measures to many is like saying you hate Jesus and enjoy killing puppies for fun. Suddenly you are worse than Hitler and they wish death on you. Its nuts out there. This sub is a place of sanity and civility. Even when its been attacked so badly.</p>

<p>I don't like the use of the word "ostensible" as that insinuates that your narrative is correct and the views in this sub are completely wrong which isn't the case. There is no right or wrong way to approach this pandemic. There are viewpoints from both sides of the argument that are viable.</p>

        <p>Ostensible means “stated or appearing to be true, but not necessarily so.”  I actually looked it up after using it just to make sure I was using it as I intended to.  It fits.  The sub’s name is “NoNewNormal.”  That doesn’t really say anything about what it is though.  You have to look deeper into it to discern what it is “ostensibly” about.  I wasn’t trying to paint this sub as something it wasn’t, so sorry if I did that.</p>
<p>“Covid denialism,” sure, that term presumes I am right and you’re wrong.  But “ostensible,” I would argue does not.  All I was saying was “what I perceive this sub to be all about.”</p>

        <p>I posted about this in r/cringetopia. We welcome open discussion and thought, even if we disagree. They insist we ban everyone. </p>
<p>I dont see that. Maybe they got banned for getting triggered by our views and then posted hateful comments? Idk but this is the only place on the internet where you can converse about things related to the virus besides masks and cases. And I find it refreshing, even if I disagree.</p>

        <p>Huh.  I honestly feel like I’ve said quite a few things on this sub where I pressed the button thinking “oh well, guess I’m gonna get the ban hammer for this but I just don’t care,” but it has never come.  I got banned from r/conservative literally for just posting trump quotes verbatim.  I didn’t editorialize, I didn’t add anything to them, I just quoted him word for word.  Got permanently banned for “spamming” because I used the same quote twice.</p>
