    <strong>When is the dam going to break? I can't stand it any longer, watching culture and society fall apart to protect the politicians' favorite interest groups.</strong>
    <p><p>(I know there is an aversion to reading long things, but I worked on this over a few days. Thought I wouldn't bother posting it, but did!)</p>
<p>COVID has shown what a dysfunctional society we live in by presenting us with a crisis. The crisis is that there is a virus that <em>mostly</em> causes the death of death-age people. That's a shame, but it's not the end of the world. Yet "our" leaders have decided that it IS the end of the world. They have decided that the human rights of the many are literally meaningless because seniors, average age 82, are dying.</p>
<p>I cannot wrap my head around it. "Our" leaders clearly have a desire to control others, and to inflict punishment on "rule breakers" for doing nothing but living according to the laws that have allowed us as much success as we had until now. Those laws mostly worked for the individual, and for society. But our society has for decades failed to attract competent leaders – preferring grift, double-speak, preferential treatment for "interest groups", and corruption – and failed to maintain a rational culture that allows difficult conversations to be had in public. </p>
<p>Instead, we have vending-machine politics: politicians at the podium dispense the same old shit. You know that certain buttons will be pressed, the same old mechanisms engaged, and predictable junk will come out. We have a situation where politicians are completely incapable of appealing to their own humanity, and to our humanity. There is no honesty and no nuance. The politicians are instead consumed by their obsession with modern "public relations", in which any of the following human things are disqualifying: being imperfect and admitting mistakes; giving offense to people; and not putting the needs of the elite above the rest of us. I cannot name a politician who I would say cares about the quality of <em>my</em> life, and that's because I am not in any of the demographics they care about: I am not a corporate lobbyist or large-business mogul, a baby boomer/senior citizen, or a public-sector employee. Those groups are roughly all they care about. Since I am none of those, I don't exist to them, and the loss of my, and your, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year">quality-adjusted life years</a> to their covid policies is <em>completely meaningless</em> to them.</p>
<p>When will the dam break? When will politicians lose the nerve to tell me I'm evil if I leave the house because my fundamental right to move, and gather, <em>supposedly</em> correlates with more 82 year olds dying?  The politicians are so void of guiding values that they have chosen mere life over <em>life worth living</em>. We are losing millions of <em>quality-adjusted person years</em> to extend the lives of death-age people by a few months or years. On this path, they are going to destroy many of us - those of us who they do not care about because we are not in one of their "special" demographics. </p>
<p>I already feel destroyed, to be honest. Nothing much has happened to me, yet, <strong>but I have felt an infinite number of future doors being closed. This has caused me immense grief.</strong> Multiply this fate by hundreds of millions of people in supposedly "free societies", below age 60, who are also not in the politicians' favored groups.</p>
<p>The real culture of death is the one the politicians have created in response to this pandemic. They could let the rest of us live our lives, and ramp up hospital capacity, protect seniors, and come up with frameworks for managing large numbers of low-resource covid patients in hospital. (I am <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/l16p28/im_a_junior_doctor_who_has_been_working_on_the/">citing a doctor who posted to /LockdownSkepticism and mentioned how low-resource most covid patients are</a>.) They can also, as logic and nature would have it, let the frailest elderly die as comfortably as possible.</p>
<p>Instead, I see behind me endless escalations in the failed "fight" against COVID, and I see more of them in front of me too. They aren't going to stop, because ... I truly don't know the reason, though I have plenty of guesses. I don't even want to talk about my guesses.</p>
<p>Let the rest of us live our lives without shame. If deaths go up by 20% among the elderly for a couple of years, folks, that's nature. It's nature returning to the soil a lot of frail people who have lived to, or beyond, their normal lifespan already, because of advanced medicine. That's not <em>anyone's fault</em>. Stop fucking blaming <em>anyone</em> for nature's cruelty, from which none of us will ultimately escape. For the love of god, stop <em>adding more cruelty</em>, you misguided/incompetent/corrupt politicians.</p></p>

        <p>James Corbett made video on this subject, if you haven't seen it I advise watching it.  https://www.corbettreport.com/how-do-i-wake-up-my-friends-and-family-qfc-065/</p>
<p>You can't force someone to wake up. It's incredibly frustrating, especially when it's someone you really care about. In general it's a numbers game. You have to try to reach as many people as possible, and if someone just refuses to listen to logic move on to the next person. You don't have to give up on them, just give them time.</p>
<p>As for tips on waking people up, I'd say don't try too hard. You're going up against organizations that spend millions, if not billions, to keep people asleep. Waking up can be a  painful experience. If I was in your shoes, I would just drop a fact or two every so often.  Nothing too hard to believe, I'm just trying to plant a seed in their mind. Something that is supported by a mainstream media source will have a better chance at sprouting than alternative media sources, or even scientific sources.  </p>
<p>I would also try to point out all the flip-flopping from mainstream/official sources to plant seeds of doubt.  Like no masks/masks, no asymptomatic spread/mostly symptomatic spread, etc....  There are lots of these but those two are the first that came to mind.</p>
<p>If there's any detail of the mainstream narrative they have shown any sign of not fully believing I would think about how I can expand on that...</p>
<p>I have something I've been working on I can send you later that's about the vaccine specifically. It's not yet finished so I don't want to make it public yet...</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps, it's just what I was able to put together on my lunch break...</p>

        <p>Such a good comment.</p>
<p>When you are awake, it is damn near impossible to understand the asleep, or fall back yourself.</p>
<p>But for the asleep, waking up is scary AF. First, there’s cognitive dissonance. </p>
<p>Then there’s the entire construct of your worldview being shattered and because most people’s egos (in the psychological definition) are so intricately tied to their worldview, their ego will very effectively block any threat it detects to its potential demise. It’s a self-protection mechanism and some people, upon the edge of waking up, do go damn near mad.</p>
<p>There’s also pragmatic concerns: social circles. Fear of isolation. Fear of insecurity. Fear of having to go it “alone.”</p>
<p>So yes, the human psyche will do all it can to protect its own beliefs. It is a rare few who are willing to think critically and frequently turn the mirror inward.</p>

        <p>This is beautifully written and I agree with you completely. What has happened to society is Inversion - we are 'protecting the old' whilst harming the young, which is the opposite of what all sane societies do, mostly because the young are the future and society would die out without them. We are harming immune systems by forcing people to mask up and avoid each other and calling it 'for safety' and 'for the greater good.' The economy is being destroyed for a virus with a 99.74% survival rate. We are calling people pointing out that the vaccine could be harmful, 'dangerous.' Truth is labelled as 'misinformation' whilst genuine 'misinformation' is spewed out  24/7 of the news, and spread across the radio, social media, youtube - it's everywhere and hard to escape. These are just a few examples of the inversion. Once you see it you see it everywhere.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you're feeling so low. I am too. I'm not sure what the answer is to be honest. I think focusing on what you're losing will just keep you feeling down though, so if you can, find something you can channel your energy into, like starting up a business from home or adopting a shelter dog, plant a garden to grow your own food, anything positive basically. Exercise what little freedom you still have left. That's what I'm doing and it helps. Also, you could consider moving to a less tyrannical location (see recent thread which talks about how some countries are open as usual). </p>
<p>Think of the quotation:</p>
<p>"As you wander on through life, friend</p>
<p>Whatever be your goal</p>
<p>Keep your eye upon the donut</p>
<p>and not upon the hole."</p>
<p>Focus on the light, not the darkness. The way I see it, we are living under a dark and tyrannical regime. Lots of people in the past lived through and survived dark and tyrannical regimes so I try to learn from them. They were often very creative in finding ways around the restrictions. I read that in communist places they'd often live normally 'underground' whilst pretending to be abiding by the rules. In Kerala alcohol was banned, but bars just served it in teapots. The police knew and turned a blind eye. I think sometimes what makes everything feel worse is that we look too far ahead. If you can try to bring yourself back to the present moment it helps.</p>
<p>It's very, very tough. But we must never give up. The truth will out and the light always wins in the end.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the compliment &amp; thoughtful reply. (Sometimes I feel there is probably a slightly better place to post my essays on this subject. I've had a lot of them, many aborted, under two accounts since April 2020! I am afraid of /LS these days. I get the sense that only important people are allowed to post to it. Maybe that's why /NNN has lapped it in subscribers now!)</p>
<p>You are right about focusing on what is still possible. For me, that would mean making one of the biggest decisions of my life (better place to live in) -- and then I could adopt a dog (itself no small decision for a person who lives alone). I don't even take for granted that people will be allowed to move freely, with respect to real estate and renting etc in the future. There is no curtailment of democracy/free society that I don't see being in our future now, just because everything smells so funny these days. (And to your point: none of this pandemic response could have happened if society hadn't already been "sick" in a lot of ways. It has always quietly valued baby boomers over the rest, for example, as Eric Weinstein points out a lot in his podcast. E.g. why are 65+ year olds still leading most institutions and still at the center of US government? It's basically a  roundabout proof that they have fixed the entire system in their favor, and intend to keep it that way, so we'll soon see 99-year-old presidents and congressional leaders, lol.)</p>
<p>Anyway, best to you!</p>

        <p>Thank you, and I love your idea of moving if that is what you gut is telling you to do, and getting a dog sounds fantastic. I would like to move somewhere and adopt a dog too. I think we should both keep working on that. I agree that there's no longer any guarantees for what we will be banned from doing in future, our society has been taken over by tyrants now, so we may as well exercise all of our freedom while we can, and maybe we can escape the tyranny by moving too.</p>

        <p>To wake others up start with something small. Something obvious that was a lie and can be easily proven. The gulf war with the “soldiers throwing babies out of incubators”. </p>
<p>The gulf of Tonkin incident never happened</p>
<p>“War by deception” documentary about 9/11</p>
