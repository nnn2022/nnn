    <strong>Vaccine Pressure</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m a young guy, covid stands absolutely no risk to me. I also believe that the data shows that the virus does not show a severe risk to a vast, significant amount of the population, and I believe the numbers to have been all manipulated constantly, mainly thru misattributed deaths and fundamentally faulty testing.</p>
<p>Besides the point, based on all this, I had already decided I am not going to take the vaccine. I work in health care (admn) so it’s been offered to me, but I passed. </p>
<p>Now my family is planning a trip across country, and my grandparents will be there. My family is all giving me a hard time for not just getting the vaccine. I respond that I don’t think it’s fair that I should be injected with the first ever m-rna vaccine, that skipped clinical trials, where the manufacturers can not be held liable if something were to happen to me, just for their perceived sense of security (as I don’t think it’s even a threat to any of them, but I’m not going to win that argument).</p>
<p>I feel slight guilt, even though I know I am in the right. I also know that the vaccines have just started, and the pressure, from govt, employment, schools, and yes even family and friends, is only going to get worse and worse. Soon the govt will be saying, we can’t go back to normal until everyone is vaccinated, which is tyranny any way you chop it.</p>
<p>I’m just writing to vent a little, let everyone know I am experiencing this too, and you’re not alone. I think allowing people to be pressured into medical shots like this, is an extremely, extremely dangerous precedent to set. While those around me may be upset now, I truly believe i am doing the right thing, not only for myself, but for their futures, and their kids futures.</p>
<p>In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.</p>
<p>Peace and Love</p></p>

        <p>In the same boat as you. Young woman, not at risk, and more worried abt long term effects from the vaccine. </p>
<p>I’ve been speaking out that I won’t get the vaccine, and that I think people should make their own choice based on the risk they perceive. Some of the responses have been awful- but there are a few who see where I’m  coming from and just disagree, and a few people who feel the same way and just don’t say anything probably out of fear. </p>
<p>We cannot let this slide. The ability to make your own health choices is one of the most important rights a person has, and I won’t relinquish mine.</p>

        <p>Same here. I work as a cna caregiver in an assisted living facility. My residents are such extrem sheep they openly call anyone who dosent want the covid gene therapy shot crazy and stupid. I dont even feel guilty about lieing to them saying I took it. This drug hasn't even existed long enough to know the long term side effects. In five or ten years I might take it depending on how peoples health reacts but no way am I taking it now.</p>

        <p>Lol, if they all get vaccinated, then you can't infect them, (edit: and they can't infect you,) so what's the problem? You are the only one at risk here, and you should be free to make that choice.</p>
<p>I'm lucky, my entire family has always been anti-vaxx so they all agree with me not to get it. My mother does feel pressured to get it, but so far she hasn't.</p>

        <p>For the United States there were 8,138 deaths per million in 2010, growing at 0.90 to 1.290% a year to test at 8,782 deaths per million in 2019.</p>
<p>In 2020 there was supposed to be 8,880 deaths per million, but it ended up being 10,127 deaths per million for both the largest year over year gain, and the highest death rate period for the past 70 years.</p>

        <p>Macrotrends.net for the historical death rates, the 2020 estimate, and the 2020 population.</p>
<p>It’s a commonly cited page from this sub, typically to say that death rates hadn’t increased but that’s because people seem to ignore the prominent header that says the death rate was a projection and hasn’t been updated.</p>
<p>Luckily we have the total number of deaths back from the CDC, and as we are just a day shy of the eight week reporting delay in compiling the death certificates I can safely assume that the 2020 total death toll in the US isn’t likely to increase appreciably in the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>3,354,216 official deaths in the US in 2020, per the CDC that’s 18% more than should have occurred.</p>

<p>I’m definitely down to see your UK data if you’re willing to post a source.</p>

        <p>I'm fourty-freakin-five and I'm not getting it either. Not until this 'trial' run is concluded. I'm also a nurse that works for a state facility. We wear masks and face shields. The state is giving those vaccinated a distinguishing name badge so they can be excused from wearing the face shield as an incentive to get vaccinated. So the rest of us will be targeted, pressured, and segregated. Plus my health care choices should not be public knowledge. Should I be able to color my badge pink the next time I go to the gynoncologist? I want everyone to know this girl is clean!</p>
