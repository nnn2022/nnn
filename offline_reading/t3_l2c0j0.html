    <strong>Do you see yourself as born in the wrong era because of Covid and Clown World?</strong>
    <p><p>We were born into an age and generation of sheep. Why? Is there any purpose to us being born into a world we don't get?</p></p>

        <p>I got to enjoy normal life for all of my teens and 20s. I would rather have been born in the mid 70s  - early 80s to have experienced even more of it, but too long before that and women didnâ€™t have as many rights which would have also sucked.</p>

        <p>I was born in the mid 70s. The 80s was a fantastic time to be a kid and the 90s was a great time to be a teen. It was not all great, though. We worried about things like nuclear war with the USSR.</p>

        <p>I feel like this 100%. Totally wish I was never born. Thatâ€™s my true sentiment.. I realize that they say each generation deals with different challenges but this one is truly baffling.. I just wish I was born in a time before technology maybe ..  idk but yes to answer the question in short.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I wouldnâ€™t want to wish all years away, the way i wished for 2020 to go fuck itself.  But, I wish I could have been in my 20â€™s during the mid 70â€™s to mid 80â€™s.  People <em>seemed</em> happier and more vibrant, until HIV began to run its course in the early 80â€™s.  Fair enough that it was a contagious disease, and at that time, nearly a death sentence.  And while it wasnâ€™t an airborne contagion, it was wrong to assume it was only for the high risk or alternative lifestyles.  HIV was scary shit, and it ended the party that had been going on for quite some time, in the early mid 80â€™s.</p>
<p>But I think of that time as being relatively care free.  I was born in 75, so I have no recollection of the era, until maybe the early 80â€™s, but watching video from that time of the great discos and nights out people were having, makes me long for it.  We had tremendous economic expansion in the 80â€™s, following a nasty bout of inflation in the early 70â€™s.</p>
<p>But, people were free to do as they pleased.  There was relative social harmony, even though injustices did exist.  I think the key difference between now and then is how everything NOW is broadcast and videoed.  Someone is always looking over you shoulder now.</p>
<p>I went to college in the mid 90â€™s until the end of the 90â€™s.  Some of the things I got up to, I would never want videoed.  Nothing illegal, and Iâ€™m a pretty straight laced guy, always have been.  Raised by strict-ish parents. And thatâ€™s the kind of parent I am now.  But I want my kids to understand what discipline is while they are young, so they can practice self-discipline when they are older, without the need for a fucking nanny state.</p>

<p>Well honestly, that was me.  And yes, it kicked ass.  But to get there you had to get through assasinations, cuban missiles, Mumps, measles, chicken pox, duck and cover, inner city riots, garbage strikes, Vietnam and draft evasion, Nixon, I can go on.  Every time has it's good and bad points.  Even AIDs wasn't that big a deal unless you were sleeping with a gay, Haitian IV drug user. </p>
<p>IMHO as an old grumpy guy, the current world is less imposed on the current population than created by them.  We asked government to take care of us, protect us and not ask us to take care of ourselves. We didn't want the responsibility.  That's what we got.</p>

        <p>100% no and if you think you are go do a deep dive into world history. This is more the norm than the exception. </p>
<p>Look at how Russian society was torn apart during the revolution. Millions were executed or sent to slave camps for questioning the government. </p>
<p>In China the government killed tens of millions. Anyone questioning the party was shot. </p>
<p>The world nearly went into a hot nuclear war because of our fear, hatred and hysteria of "the other". </p>
<p>World war II razed most of Europe and led to 50 million dead. </p>
<p>World War 1 razed most of Europe because a guy got shot in a carriage. </p>
<p>The Rwandan genocide happened because people had the wrong shaped nose... boom hundreds of thousands butchered with machetes. People told stories about a river flowing with an unbroken stream of corpses. </p>
<p>The Balkan war was based purely on ethnic hatred and a craving for power and the UN literally sat on a hill and watched with binoculars as Serbian soldiers genocided thousands. </p>
<p>Governments have weaponized and brainwashed crowds of people into doing their bidding as long as we have had civilization. </p>
<p>This is nothing new.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, it's all random bullshit. Some get the long straw, the majority get the short straw and get fucked. Every era/generation is shit and always will be shit. You wanna know why? Because the majority of humans are shit and shit trickles down.</p>
