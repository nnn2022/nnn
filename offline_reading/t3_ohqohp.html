        <p>It may not be true but if you go back 130 years allopathic medicine was not very well like, the idea of putting a poison into your body to cure an illness just seemed so counter-intuitive</p>
<p>Most people preferred holistic medicine, that was until a certain Mr Rockerfeller decided to get involved with his friend Mr Carnegie and together they took over the "medicine" industry primarily by demonising homeopathic Doctors, calling them quacks, having their licenses taken off them etc -  have a look at the Flexner report...</p>
<p>He then gave more than Â£100 million to hospitals and colleges who were all too willing to follow his line and then gave huge Grants to "scientists" to study cures from plants and then recreate them in the lab so they could be patented and sold</p>
<p>doesnt that seem a little familiar given whats being going on with Ivermectin and HCQ</p>

        <p>Not sure.</p>
<p>But I would stick to eating healthy and making sure like your vitamin d, b12 and iron levels were good.</p>

        <p>No, not really. </p>
<p>AFAIK herbal tinctures and such are under traditional medicine. </p>
<p>I actually don't know much about this despite being pretty knowledgeable on the medical front. Note we stopped using traditional medicine more or less when we moved on to modern medicine and pharmaceuticals. </p>
<p>Seems like it's mostly a placebo. I wouldn't bother even trying these types of "cures" for much considering some can actually be harmful.</p>
<p>I will bring up though that honey or maple syrup can help with a sore throat, but that's about it.</p>
