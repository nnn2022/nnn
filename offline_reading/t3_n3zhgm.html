<p>Amazing piece about how they monopolized the H1N1 virus, how WHO just wanted to sound the bells and whistles, and how they gave zero shits of the economic and societal impact it had on people, DESPITE it being a false alarm. They have been prepping to manipulate people like this for decades.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I guess people are just dumbed down enough with their social media, drugs, caffeine, porn, entertainment, work, fast food, and soda that false alarms just sound like alarms. Its sad a bunch of hedonistic pigs are what the "herd" is nowadays. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My favorite paragraph, "The publicity and resulting panic surrounding the WHO's announcement of Phase 5 and 6 alerts--especially since the vaccine was not widely available until December--also brought out the fraudulent peddling of all sorts of ineffective and possibly dangerous protective gear and nostrums, including gloves, masks, dietary supplements, shampoo, a nasal sanitizer and a spray that supposedly coats the hands with a layer of anti-microbial "ionic silver." </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>See how masks were considered fraudulent peddling during the H1N1 "pandemic" yet they are life saving devices now? All it takes is suffocating all the information provided before 2019 and people will believe a completely different narrative. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why are we trusting the same organization with global domination now, that ten years ago we were calling incompetent frauds with a complete lack of realistic decision making? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Because people filled their brains with so much other garbage, all the knowledge has been lost. They do not dare read articles before 2019 because it shatters the illusion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Quick duckduckgo searches will prove it all otherwise though.</p></p>

        <p>Just a quick note, the media was still completely corrupt 10 years ago, they just had a different agenda.  Don't assume that ANY media, politician, "expert", celebrity, whatever isn't corrupt or is "based" or whatever just because they happen to agree with you at that moment.</p>
<p>edit: otherwise it's a good reminder that the media pushes the public agenda and no matter how quickly it changes most people will still swallow it as gospel</p>

        <p>Hence why in my title I specifically said "wasn't completely bought out" aka part of it was and part of it wasn't, because I knew someone would immediately comment with what you are saying. Didn't help I guess lol</p>
