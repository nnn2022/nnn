    <strong>Nothing feels fun anymore</strong>
    <p><p>My county has been “reopened” for a month. Meaning we still have to wear masks everywhere, have 25% capacity restaurants and 50% capacity other businesses, salons by appointment only...basically it’s like not being open at all except for the scraps Tom Wolf gave us. A local news reporter showed a graph today that indicates our county is holding steady in case growth and has seen no major spikes, yet we still have all these restrictions. </p>
<p>Anyway, even when I go out and do things, the things I enjoyed pre-COVID seem like the life and energy has been wiped out of them. Go shopping but follow these arrows and stand here in line and cram together with everyone else so we can have fewer registers for “social distancing.” Go to Starbucks but get in and get out because you can’t even sit down inside for your “safety.” Go to a restaurant that might have rules such as “no visiting other tables.” So if my friend walks into a restaurant when I’m eating with my family, she can’t come over to me and say hi and I can’t walk over to her. Want to go to a gym? Now you may have to wear a mask when working out! Amusement park? Masks all day long. </p>
<p>My sport of ice skating is even less fun. Must skate in a mask and wear one while changing into your skates OUTSIDE when it’s 90 degrees. Must get your temperature checked. Must fill out a questionnaire and account for your health and where you’ve traveled to to some non-medical professional. My club also complained to the rink about hockey players not wearing masks under the tent and demanded better enforcement. (This is the only thing I hate about figure skating...skating moms can get bitchy.) </p>
<p>Sports are gone and/or fans aren’t allowed in. Can’t go to a fair, see a movie or go to a concert. No cruises. Masks are required at church while they preach to not live in fear and they discourage everyone from singing. </p>
<p>And the worst part is that most of my friends and family don’t seem to mind living like this! No one seems to care that they’re missing out on what makes life worth living. They’re just fine with living life behind a screen and saying to me “just change your mindset.” They cancel a vacation and express no disappointment and just shrug. Well I certainly have tried to be positive, but this is how I feel. This is no way to live the days and years we’ve been given. And if you even want to bend the “rules,” everyone just complains about you being “selfish” and not “doing your part” and says how terrible Americans are for not stopping something they can’t control. I just wish life had joy in it again.</p></p>

        <p>We've turned life into bare minimum existing. Nothing worthwhile is allowed. People want to claim that nobody is doing anything because they are afraid of the virus. Bullshit. Nobody wants to be subjected to all of these silly rules, especially when a "fun" activity is taking place.</p>

        <p>I definitely agree with that. The most I'll do is take my toddler to parent/child classes at her gym but even that is annoying because I have to wear a mask the entire time. At least my toddler doesn't have to though so win? </p>
<p>I don't want to do anything outside because you have to wear a mask. I am shocked people are going to Disney World..it sounds miserable. I'm glad theme parks are opening but I don't want to go because what's the point in going when you have to sweat in a mask the entire day??</p>

        <p>Same. I also can't interact with the other parents when I'm in a mask. I mean...I CAN but it's hard. I can't see their face so I have no idea if they are smiling or if they actually want to talk.</p>

        <p>I was at a bar patio holding my drink in my hand, when the fucking douchebag server who's patrolling around walks up and says "Put your mask on!" I told him I was about to take a sip and he literally said unless the straw is in my mouth I needed to have my mask on. I was like fuck this bullshit asked for my tab and got the fuck out of there. Seriously, what is the point of going out with friends if we're subjected to these asinine, arbitrary fucking rules. Im going out less now than I was during full lockdown in March/April. It's fucking depressing.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I can't stand going anywhere anymore. What's the point if everyone is wearing masks and there little to no social interaction allowed anymore. This is all soul crushing, which leads me to believe most of the doomers and the apathetic are soulless. The NPC meme is very real.</p>

        <p>i'm gonna start making it fun. i'm going to go out wearing a ridiculous costume, silly rubber gloves, a p100 construction respirator, a neon orange life jacket, sunglasses under construction goggles, i wish i had a helmet to go with it. or one of those snazzy white plastic jumpers that you wear when you work with auto paint or spray foam.

        <p>It's sad. I posted the same thing recently on Facebook and had 12 friends delete me as a friend, multiple people call me selfish and another friend say that she's sick of people complaining about lockdown and that we should all think of the kids with cancer. So I basically felt like a piece of shit. I don't care what anyone says though. This way of living SUCKS and no amount of "you're selfish" is going to change my mindset. It blows my mind that people are fine living this way.</p>

        <p>I’ve only seen it reported once by the MSM. It was one story about a woman who died due to missed treatments. Seems any disadvantage or bad effects of the lockdowns are quickly brushed off or blamed on the virus and not the draconian lockdowns</p>

        <p>I dont think most people are fine with it . Do not let social media doomers convince you that most are okay with it. At best, I would say people are tolerating it because what are you going to do? Police is enforcing it. They are willing to send the National Guard to enforce it. Most people aren't going to stand up to the government when they think their life is at stake or they will get thrown in prison. Media is pushing fear 24/7. But this country can't take this level of economic destruction for much longer and when it finally collapses for good people are going to realize starvation and suicide is much bigger threat than Covid with a much higher death rate. All in due time.</p>

        <p>This is my biggest issue as well. I'm in my 20s supposed to having the "time of my life". I finally got my stuff together last year. This year decided I was going to focus on my health and finances. Make some major new years strides from Jan 1st to Mid March and then this bullshit happened. Now the only young years we have are being taken away living in this dystopian garbage pile of a fearmongering country. No concerts, no museums, no bars, no clubs, no fun. I'm not even a MASSIVE extroverted person who does stuff all the time. But I liked the ability to do stuff when I COULD it's part of what made the country free. </p>
<p>I have 3 years until I'm 30 and my 20s are up and I basically spent half of them in fucking college being broke in a post 08 recession economy, got in tons of expensive student loan debt, house and apartment prices soared and became unaffordable(what used to be a 600-700$ a month apartment became 1500$ after 2008) and decided to try to have a good mentality about it and just work myself out of the hole and can't even do that now because the job market is collapsing along with the economy. This self imposed collapse is going to go down as the dumbest decision in human history without a doubt. I'm not suicidal but I don't really care anymore. They want to take our youth away from us let it fucking collapse. I can survive in the woods I was trained to do it, but many people can't and FAR more will die of starvation than of Covid.</p>

        <p>I graduated in 2008. I definitely feel your pain. I finally found my way back to my original career field last year after four years of not being able to find work in it, and now I’m looking at a career with more promise. I still have my regular job but lost out on a part time job that I love and was looking forward to doing again this summer. And the response I got for expressing my disappointment was “It’s for the best” and “If it saves a life, isn’t it worth it?” </p>
<p>I honestly never expected us to be doing this nearly five months later, yet we have to hear constantly how it’s all our fault because we didn’t “obey” or “behave” or “follow the rules.” We keep hearing “If we stayed home/wore masks/whatever, this would be over.” But humans can only do so much about a virus no matter how “perfect” they behave.</p>

        <p>In the US, the Republican party was proposing cutting the unemployment bonus to $200 a week, but Nancy Pelosi (the House speaker) said the $600 is really needed and the deal has already been shot down to be reworked. </p>
<p>At least $200 a week might incentivize people a little more to go back to work. I want to be more active outside the home enough that I’m considering taking a side gig. If all these assholes expect to get free money for nothing,
they’re going to be in for a shock when they actually have to go back to work and can’t scream “I don’t wanna because SAFETY!!” anymore.</p>

        <p>The big question is what the Republicans do. I think they'll have to come to a compromise number on that unemployment bonus, but is still significant enough of a cut to get people to go back to work (and subsequently, protest to their governors that "we want our jobs back").</p>

<p>Going to the local community pool with my family is great. You have to wear a mask to walk through the lobby, but you can take it off when you get inside and everything is basically 100% normal in there. Kids playing, no distancing, no masks, no arrows. </p>
<p>Also have had a lot of small get togethers with friends to play board games, and even been at a couple bigger backyard bbqs in which everything is totally normal.</p>

        <p>I can relate to the last part. My mom used to be hardcore "please stay at home" however just about 3 weeks ago she told me that she was becoming sick of lockdowns and wanted to go out. She also realized the media trap and has stopped watching news.</p>
<p>Here's hoping your friends and family switch sides and realize the media trap. Even if they never do you still got a lot of people on your side</p>

        <p>I’ve been doing more hikes and long walks recently. It’s a pain when people insist on passing in a six foot radius on a narrow trail, but otherwise I can enjoy myself without worrying about health guidelines. I don’t know where you are in Pennsylvania, but there are lots of great hiking areas in state, especially if you can drive.</p>

        <p>I went to harbor freight yesterday and the guy said “you can’t come in without a mask”. So i has said “fuck it I’ll go somewhere else.”  I went a big hardware store, I won’t name so the fucking mask wearing nazi assholes don’t try to report them to the SS, which I doubt they care about.  I’d say 50% of customers didn’t have masks.  No one stops you at the door. Most Employees have them on, but under their nose. Some didn’t have them.  One lady came in wearing a mask, looked at me without a mask, crinkled her eyebrows and tore the mask off.  Some people are just afraid to not wear a mask but when they see other defying it, they get the courage to do it.  That’s why I don’t wear a mask.  Harbor freight is the only place here that has refused me this entire time.  No one else seems to care.  Everyday less people wear masks.</p>

        <p>I live near Reading. Moved out here a year ago from Maryland. Everyday feels like I'm in the Twilight Zone. Scary to think we still have two more years of Wolf to go. The capacity % for restaurants and bars? I don't see that changing until he leaves office. I agree nothing much feels fun anymore. It sounds funny saying that as a guy in his earlier 30s but yea. Kinda hard to get lost in anything. And I'm done trying to distract myself. Luckily I'm still working I suppose.</p>

        <p>If that doesn’t change until 2022 or 2023, PA won’t have many restaurants left. Especially as places can’t offer outdoor seating in the winter...</p>
<p>It amazes me that Wolf still has so many supporters. </p>
<p>I have family down in Reading. So many good areas not far from there like Bethlehem, Lancaster, etc.</p>

        <p>&rt;My sport of ice skating is even less fun. Must skate in a mask and wear one while changing into your skates OUTSIDE when it’s 90 degrees. Must get your temperature checked. Must fill out a questionnaire and account for your health and where you’ve traveled to to some non-medical professional. My club also complained to the rink about hockey players not wearing masks under the tent and demanded better enforcement. (This is the only thing I hate about figure skating...skating moms can get bitchy.) </p>
<p>I'm a hockey player in a small local league and all my games have been cancelled, and if I just want to go skate at the very least I have to put up with all the bullshit.</p>
<p>So I picked up rollerblading because I'm really dying to get out and do something that resembles skating. Luckily I was able to get a pair, but guess what, because everything is closed people are picking up all outdoor hobbies. This means that rollerblades and all their associated parts are bought out just about everywhere due to a huge sudden surge in demand. </p>
<p>Like I said, I was lucky to be able to swipe a reasonably priced pair in my size early on, but my friends are having no such luck.</p>
<p>And I completely agree with you on the going out has no spark. Any place that is following all the rules is really no fun, it's like they expect to you go in shut up eat and get out, even in previously rowdy bars. My advice would be to look for a small bar on the outskirts of town, you're likely to find a little hole in the wall that doesn't give a shit about the rules and is packed to the brim.</p>

        <p>Figure skaters were having the same problem getting pic skates/inline skates. I didn’t even try because of the price, and I’m a beginner anyway, so I picked up where I left off.</p>
