        <p>I probably would.  I've been red pilled for a very long time, since I was a kid.  Maybe some of us are wired that way.  It hasn't brought much more to my life than an "outsider" feeling.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I wouldn't want to be a hive minded ninny and I've learned so much.</p>
<p>That's a great discussion topic, OP.</p>

        <p>Probably not, because then I'd be choosing to be scared all the time, and would uncritically hate and ridicule the very kind of people I think this world needs to keep from turning into a pure dystopian nightmare - the troublemakers, the people who question what they are told, etc. (You know, the exact kind of people leftists celebrate when they're not fully in power)</p>
<p>As much as all this sucks, to be on the 'wrong' side of this (relative to the masses) ... the innately free human spirit needs all the help it can get on Earth right now. It's in danger of being exterminated, and even if we don't succeed in any great numbers, we can plant the seeds for the next generation to resume from. Let them know it wasn't always like whatever horrible Borg-like machine they inherit from the present day.</p>
<p>Also, the leftists that I see all around, who are winning the PR war, are generally unhappy people. They tend to be proudly mentally ill, lonely within 'hookup culture', nothing to live for (except hedonism and crushing their enemies), self-medicated with legal and illegal drugs, and - the best part - even though they are winning everywhere, are terribly paranoid of losing at any moment. A single red hat somewhere in a crowd is enough to trigger them to their bones. They can't feel safe until they get FULL compliance. That's a pretty deep insecurity, and not one I'm in any hurry to claim for myself.</p>

        <p>I absolutely wouldn't, I don't want to be one with the sheeple honestly... I've been red pilled for a long while quite honestly and have just been brought up to question everything... from watching William Cooper to reading Behold a pale horse and even watching David Icke and reading his books, it just kept my eyes open to read more and research on the true meaning and agenda on everything going on... once you have your eyes open to the real truth, I feel like blue pilling isn't possible!</p>

        <p>No. If someone's trying to make my life worse, I want to know about it. Maybe I can't completely prevent them from doing it. I can make it harder, and take steps to minimize the damage. I can't do that if I have my head in the sand and believe that nasty liars are being nice, helpful, and honest.</p>

        <p>No.</p>
<p>Like  u/MeanieMem0 , I've always been an outsider and never really fitted in. I hung with every group (jocks, nerds, goths, artsies, metalheads, dopers, etc)  but never nailed my flag to the mast of any of them. My group of friends and I spent most of our time mocking everyone else for their conformity.</p>
<p>We weren't paragons of high-school popularity, but we weren't ostracized either; I think a lot of guys and gals respected our refusal to play the social status game.</p>
<p>My experiences insulated me against groupthink, I guess. I was also very lucky to have parents who taught me to think critically, stand up for my beliefs, and encouraged me to look beyond the surface of things.</p>
<p>I am also a big history buff. If you know history, it helps to make sense of what you see in present-day life.</p>
<p>At least when I am dragged to the boxcar, I will have the inner satisfaction of knowing they never managed to make me believe the lies. The NPC's, however, will have their entire worldview shattered.</p>

        <p>Huh, amazingly I can relate to all of that except some of my groups were into social status too because that was expected of them. Even the history buff part and family who encouraged critical and individual thought.</p>
<p>I decided I should be me and not try to fit in.  Allowed me to enjoy spending time by myself, doing things I like, good or bad, and being comfortable with that.  So many people aren't comfortable being by themselves and that makes <em>me</em> uncomfortable if they try to glom on. </p>
<p>Might sound selfish, but I try to encourage those who ask to do the same: live your life for you, not for anyone else. Most people can't do that.  That's what I was encouraged to do at a young age.</p>

        <p>Yup. Being comfortable in solitude and quiet is a quality lost in most people. Right from kindergarten we are taught that to be reticent and solitary is a character flaw.</p>
<p>They don't like it if you won't give yourself wholeheartedly to the collectivist "village" - because they realize they can't ever really control you.</p>

        <p>No they do not like it one bit.  But that's their problem and I wouldn't make it mine.  Tried once or twice but it just was not me. Of course the counselors and psychologists have any number of negative terms for that but essentially it's "won't conform."</p>

        <p>No. They come off as extremely angry and irrational and tightly wound. I wouldn’t want to be like that. My lack of blue pill is why I’m going to exercise classes &amp; working hard to get healthier. I wouldn’t want to be someone that wasted 10 months and more of their life on self imposed house arrest. So much time wasted.</p>

        <p>After swallowing the Red Pill, I'm tired. I'm emotionally done, quite often. I'm losing hope for my children's futures.
I won't do it but a Lead Pill sounds like a good plan at times...</p>

        <p>Sometimes I wish I could really truely believe all this was for the greater good. Sometimes I wonder what it would feel like putting on the mask and legitimayely believing I am protecting peoples lives from a deadly virus.</p>
<p>I almost envy them for how blissful sheer ignorance seems. Then I remember. Theyre trying to enslave us all and they are the dumb ones who will die first. Who will be completely blindsided when it all comes crashing down and big daddy government is not there to care for them and protect them. </p>
<p>God help us all.</p>

        <p>Definitely not, i don't want to be someone who feels that much hate towards other people. It would probably feel like poison coursing through your veins. Yes, there are people who aren't so aggressive about it, but i prefer to keep logic and reason over blind fear</p>

        <p>Certainly not. It's hard at times, and things are getting a bit scary right now, but I'd much rather know what's actually going on. </p>
<p>I called the Covid hoax from the very beginning. Almost everyone I knew was freaking out, but I wasn't worried at all, not until I lost my job. It was then that I began to realize that this new public health scare was going to be used to further the globalization agenda in a pretty substantial way. Destroyed economy, small businesses ruined, forced vaccination, parks closed down (Agenda 21), loss of civil liberties, etc.</p>
<p>After a dose of the red pill, it's all fairly predictable, and the situation offers few surprises. And I prefer it that way. I would not be better off with my head in the sand, not at all.</p>
