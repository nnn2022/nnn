        <p>Do you have a favourite quote to share? Lazy on my part, I admit, but there's so much information to process these days that few of us can find the time to read an 80 page text written in 1979. A great quote might convince the hesitant otherwise, and seduce us into reading the whole thing...:)</p>

        <p>Here is a quote about a greengrocer putting a "workers unite" sign in his shop in the USSR:  </p>
<p>We have seen that the real meaning of the greengrocers slogan has</p>
<p>nothing to do with what the text of the slogan actually says. Even</p>
<p>so, this real meaning is quite clear and generally comprehensible</p>
<p>because the code is so familiar: the greengrocer declares his loyalty</p>
<p>(and he can do no other if his declaration is to be accepted) in the</p>
<p>only way the regime is capable of hearing; that is, by accepting the</p>
<p>prescribed ritual, by accepting appearances as reality, by accepting</p>
<p>the given rules of the game. In doing so, however, he has himself</p>
<p>become a player in the game, thus making it possible for the game</p>
<p>to go on, for it to exist in the first place.</p>

        <p>Good one - it speaks to the subtle issue of indirectly legitimizing mask mandates by claiming when asked "where is your mask", that you have a medical condition. The implication is: the mandate is legitimate, I agree with it, and if I didn't have this medical condition I would enthusiastically wear a mask. It does not tell explicitly to the person asking the question that you are opposed to mask mandates as a moral and political stance, as a matter of principle, as a matter of refusing to be part of a charade (although that person might be able to guess or read between the lines...).</p>
