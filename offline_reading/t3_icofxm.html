    <strong>Genuine question: What can I do to resist the social engineering?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm fed up with having to tolerate the delusions of doomers who enforce these mask and "social distancing" rules. I already don't wear the mask in public when walking between businesses or walking around my neighborhood, nor do I wear one at work, but I've felt like when it comes to businesses like grocery stores there's nothing I can really do about it. I was telling myself to just suck it up, but after a miserable experience I had nearly asphyxiating while wearing a mask at an amusement park I decided I just had had enough. Is there anything I can reasonably do to tell them to get bent? I still need to go get groceries but I hate that I have to acknowledge their stupid delusions to do so.</p></p>

        <p>People here are probably going to tell you to just throw your mask on the ground the next time you go to a grocery store, and stomp on it in front of everyone there, and things like that. Malicious compliance.</p>
<p>My beef with doing things like that is that, in the end, our side is still made out to be the bad guys. Most people seem content to obey these mandates, at least in the places with most compliance/mandates like NY, NJ, CA, etc. I went to a restaurant a few days ago, and an old lady got pissed off because her grandkids wanted a booth but most of them were closed for "social distancing", and she threw a fit over it to the wait staff. Everyone there, save for my spouse and I, sided with the restaurant, and basically told the lady to "shut the fuck up and leave".  </p>
<p>I think a lot of people here think that doing this sort of thing will end up having people break into an applause, and throw their own masks down to stomp on in protest. But...I just don't see that happening as of yet, except maybe somewhere like South Dakota, though they don't even have mandates there to begin with.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am in the same boat as you. I try my very best to not comply. I never wear masks outdoors, and take mine off when I leave businesses. It's virtually impossible to go into a store here without a mask, even with medical exemptions, because they just tell you to shop online instead, which I don't want to do. So I'm stuck. The best I've done is just get a mesh mask on Etsy, and it's been much more comfortable, though I am seeing more aggression against these masks as well because they "don't work", and I fear those will be banned eventually. </p>
<p>There just isn't an easy answer here. Shit's really bad right now.</p>

<p>We’re playing with semantics here, but I myself have been jumped on by randoms who literally dictate to me that I should “just take the mask off” without asking why I might be wearing it under certain circumstances. Do you expect me to stop buying food from the grocery store? Or do you expect me to take the Doomer route and allow Amazon to deliver me their sustenance? Sorry but I am big on nutrition and I’m not going to buy any food products unless I can see it directly in front of me. </p>
<p>Just saying.</p>

        <p>Of course not, if anyone expects you to just stop going to the grocery store they're being ridiculous and are disconnected from reality. And I say that as a person that has most of their groceries delivered.</p>
<p>A huge part of the problem here is this tone deaf collectivist tendency to ignore the undeniable fact that there's a diverse range of people, lifestyles, and <em>needs</em>, instituting blanket solutions and policies with no consideration to what outcomes it will actually result with in actual fact or any fallout. </p>
<p>In a similar sense to how we have to take care to not have a doomer-ism of our own, we need to refrain from reacting in a similar fashion that we are criticizing, otherwise we're just being hypocrites. So I agree, not everyone can necessarily "just take off the mask".</p>
<p>Rather than pushing individual people towards potential confrontations and fueling more animosity among us, we need to come together with solutions that target things that can make a real difference. Like organizing something more coherent than random outbursts that will be turned against you.</p>

<p>Their logic is that making a huge scene will embarrass the doomers, and "show them". Even though, I think it will have the opposite effect.</p>

<p>I haven't seen this at all, in my experience. The very vast majority of people seem to disapprove of such actions. Whenever I take my mask off outdoors, I usually get glares or people will briskly walk or jump further away from me. My actions never seem to inspire anybody at all. In fact, matters have worsened in my area. Lately, my neighbors keep having masked gatherings and doing stuff around their homes with masks on, and they yell at me or call the police when they see me without one on (people here and at LDS have told me that walking around unmasked will inspire more people to discard theirs...yeah, that hasn't happened at all).</p>

<p>That is stupid, if people really were saying that unironically / unjokingly, 100% with you there. It won't help.</p>

<p>i guess that's where we really disagree, i don't care if people disapprove and they can scowl all they want. if a confrontation is initiated it will be by them, and i'll handle it accordingly. i won't conform out of fear for reprisal because blind obedience / mass compliance is such a big part of the problem. not that i blame you or am saying you should put yourself at risk of getting into a confrontation or anything, but that's just my stance on it personally. i agree that it's hard to feel inspired about more people getting on board, especially when I go outside and see a lot of masked faces and it's depressing. it's probably difficult to measure, but i won't let that make me give up.</p>
<p>i reached out to city councillors about the mandate in my area, it still passed, but i noticed the person i wrote to actually voted against it. i don't know if i made the difference but i have to believe i wasn't the only one reaching out.  someone else posted a thread about how the canmore mask mandate inspired them to speak up and their own city put off instituting a mandate likely due to however many people started speaking up there.</p>
<p>it isn't hopeless is what i'm getting at. it's bad, and maybe it'll get worse before it gets better, but all hope is not lost</p>

        <p>I agree with you, just don't wear a mask... without making a big fuss about it. This is really about strength of character. Deal with the social shaming, accept it, without getting emotional.</p>
<p>Glares and tut-tutting won't kill you. If anybody asks, the correct answer is "I don't wear a mask". You don't owe them an explanation. If they physically grab you or assault you, then they have broken the law in a more serious way than you have. This is extremely unlikely to happen though.</p>

        <p>That's exactly it. I don't want to encourage people towards an altercation though. No one knows yourself better than you do, so for anyone reading, you do you. I'm confident enough that I can avoid a dangerous altercation but who knows what can happen? It's a crazy time. If you're a person that's likely to get baited into escalating the situation then maybe it's better not to take the chance in those instances. I guess I didn't really think about that. There's been too much tension and actual bloodshed already, I don't want to add more to it. But we have to find the right way to go about it while also not capitulating to an endless series of concessions i think.</p>

        <p>Sure, though I think that will attract confrontational pro-maskers. If you're okay with that, go for it. I, for one, am exhausted after fighting this for months. <strong>Months</strong>. I've had the police called on me several times (in my own neighborhood), had people get in my face to fight me, had cars aggressively rev at me while crossing the street, people scream "wear a fucking mask", etc etc <strong>etc</strong>.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat. Protesting against masks (by noncompliance, etc.) just causes more social agitation. But social agitation is exactly what I hate most about this regime and what causes me the most physiological distress.</p>

        <p>dont wear your mask but remain polite and courteous to the employees. if they ask you to leave even though you have a ''medical condition'' leave politely and never shop at that store again. that will create cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>the women probably got judged more harshly beause she pulled a fit but if she stayed polite it might have been different. remaining calm is the right thing to do or else the doomers will film and try to shame. and like i said if a private buisness asks you to leave simply bring your money elsewhere dont give fuel to the doomers by pulling a fit </p>

<p>trust me there are many people irl that are against the masks but dont do anything because of social pressure. dont fall into the trap of believing reddit with its insane amount of anti social basement dwellers  represents the majority</p>

        <p>If you just start walking into stores without a mask, you'll be surprised how often you get away with it.  I started doing it a few days ago.  I still get a little nervous, but so far no one has said or done anything besides dirty looks.  It gets a little easier each time.  If anyone does say anything I will just pretend they aren't there.  If I'm asked by an employee to leave, I will leave without protest.  But they have to ask me - I'm not going to volunteer.</p>

        <p>Try smaller chains and not mega global corporations. Giant foods near me was hardcore with mask police. My local grocery chain that is family owned has never said anything and it is less crowded than the bigger stores so win win. Gas stations don't care either, even the larger chains.</p>

        <p>I live in a mostly mask free rural area, but Walmart requires them. I went there after that started and only two people in the store had no mask. Today, I saw more than ten. No one bothered them or asked them to leave. I know it's very different in other areas, though.</p>

        <p>I was at Target yesterday and walked in with a coffee, had my mask around my chin and no one said a word or looked at me badly. Most employees actually smiled and said hello. But then again I smiled first. These people probably miss the social interaction of smiling so I don’t think the employees care. Also saw a few people walk in with no masks at all. So I just don’t think people really care all that much.</p>

        <p>the thing is if one person doesnt wear his mask, it can give courage to people who see you and are antimask to not wear either which is why its very important imo</p>
<p>you not wearing a mask does have an impact trust me its not just abut peaceful protests</p>

        <p><em>This</em> is the answer.</p>
<p>The mass protests have already been happening all around the world. Groups <em>are</em> organizing, not just for protests, but for legal challenges. Obviously CNN won't blast the world with that inconvenient tidbit and dismantle the official narrative for us.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean every little bit doesn't count, cause it does. Don't give up, friends.</p>

        <p>Just don't wear a mask... without making a big fuss about it. This is really about strength of character. Deal with the social shaming, accept it, without getting emotional. If they see that they have got to you, they won: that's the entire point of shaming, to get you to change your behaviour.</p>
<p>Glares and tut-tutting won't kill you. If anybody asks, the correct answer is "I don't wear a mask". You don't owe them an explanation. If a shopkeeper/business asks you to leave, then they are doing you a favour - you don't want to give that person your business anyway. About the only way they can "force" you to wear a mask is if they get confrontational. In this case, you just ignore them. Words must bounce off you. If you retaliate, they win. If anybody physically grabs you or assaults you, then they have broken the law in a more serious way than you have. This is extremely unlikely to happen though.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure where you live, but here in the UK, it is illegal to enter a grocery store or any store without a mask. However, I have never worn a mask, and I have never been turned away by a store. I do my daily shop just fine. I think you are imagining worse-case scenarios that are very unlikely to happen ("all grocery stores turn me away").</p>
<p>If anybody asks, the answer is "I don't wear a mask". You don't owe them an explanation. For all they know, you could have a medical condition that stops you from wearing masks. Medical conditions are confidential.</p>

        <p>A cloth mask really like any other you can buy online. It's normally comfortable enough, but the problem was that around noon when the day was at its hottest, the sweat from my face mixing with the reused air under the mask made it difficult to breathe. I would remove my mask to get some fresh air, only to have some park employee order me back into compliance.</p>

        <p>Ah. Okay. My state doesn't require mask use outdoors because... it's retarded so I didn't even think of that being an issue. I wear the cloth surgical type masks when I have to go into stores like Wal-Mart (state compliance, not Wal-Marts fault) because they have massive gaping holes next to your mouth and dont really affect breathing all that much.</p>

        <p>It depends on the person, and on the mask. </p>
<p>I used to have a cloth mask, and it was very uncomfortable. It was 90+ degrees just a few days ago in my state, and I'd find it very difficult to breathe wearing that mask. I eventually got another mask, of the mesh variety, that has eliminated the problem but people do not favor that mask because it is, allegedly, less effective (even though cloth masks have mixed results on their effectiveness in studies but people are okay with others wearing those).</p>

        <p>Just get a different mask.... nearly asphyxiating? What were you wearing a plastic bag? Masks really aren’t difficult to breathe though and if you save even just one life because of it surely it’s worth it?
