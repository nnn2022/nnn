    <strong>Do any of you have loved ones or significant others with opposing values? Do you work through it or are these crazy times dividing you?</strong>
    <p><p>When you’re conflicting with someone you are close to like family, friends and especially significant others, it can be hard to simply tolerate opposing values especially when these times make opposition increasingly more obvious. </p>
<p>To not be on the same page with those close to you is a tough battle. I’ve seen some households and families make it work although most of the time I’ve seen division like this separate people. One person says they are going this way, the other person goes another way. </p>
<p>I personally hate labels and don’t want to tie myself down to any. I will admit I lean a certain way although I can generally get along with anybody. I can also oppose people who seem to be very close to my views points and values due to other conflicting view points. Its like I don’t fit in anywhere so its hard to imagine that I’d find anything perfect.</p></p>

        <p>Its hard though to just sweep things under the rug when its someone like your significant other that your supposed to make mutual decisions with and potentially have kid with. I can do that with my mom and dad but with my bf it’s a different kind of difficult. </p>
<p>Its almost like before all this chaos people thought their vaules aligned and now more and more is starting to come to the surface and I have to really analyze and ask myself if my significant other having opposing values and opinions I didn’t really see or think about as in depth before the pandemic is really someone I want as a potential life partner. It becomes a tough choice.</p>
<p>I did of course make sure we had basic values in common. Although the divide with differing opinion on politics, what freedom means and the vaccination is really putting us at odds. I have to decipher if this is an environment I’d want to raise a kid in for the future especially if the chaos got worse.</p>

        <p>Different thresholds depending on whether it's family or just friends/acquaintances.  Political differences alone are not enough for me, but intransigence and closed minded intolerance will get me to cut off friends.  Family is family but the scope of relationship even in that case will be severely limited.</p>

        <p>I hold different values than most of my closest friends.  Thats fine.  I respect that and were still close.  Sadly the times we live in and my unwillingness to back down from my beliefs has gotten my family uninvited to a very special event of a brother from another. Never in my life did i think this would happen. It saddens me greatly.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to here it has come down to that for you. </p>
<p>What I’m really afraid of is when it comes to if I decide to have children with my significant other, there may be conflict more on our mutual decisions opposed to if I had found someone more like minded and thats where the real issues will arise.</p>

        <p>My spouse and i have some different views. But were cool about compromise most of the time. Been together for years and just had our first child. I was worried about this also and still am. But its turned out pretty good so far. Communication is key. </p>

        <p>A few worries of mine would be him wanting to vax the children if we have them. Or him wanting to teach them to over value education system even if it turns out to be a corrupt system someday. </p>
<p>I’m antivax and I was also brought up to fight for and stand up for my rights in the school system when instructors abused their power. Its not that I believe every teacher was bad and walked around all high and mighty by no means. However, I also believed it was my right to call it out when things were not right and that the instructors worked for the students as we were to be tax paying citizens someday. </p>
<p>I believe in the value of education although I don’t believe in bending over backwards to when the education system is potentially abusing power especially against the young and vulnerable which has happened in many other societies and is happening even today in our school system. I also don’t want to be teaching things that are false to my children and expect my kids to see it as truth and not question it just because their school said it was true. </p>
<p>I’m afraid my bf, if we do get married with kids, will encourage our children to over value submitting to education even if and when and if it falls corrupt. </p>
<p>He also believes in support of big businesses for an extra couple thousand a year he makes off the market and I’m personally opposed to this. I think if everyone did this our small business and economy would suffer; we’d be giving more power to the elites as we would become dependent on big government and business. I am more supportive of not putting all our eggs into one basket as a society and economy. I believe in supporting other small businesses even if it mean paying a little extra or not gaining as much money from stock to support our freedom for the future as a whole. </p>
<p>I am also a believer in allowing my children to grow up and really make their own decisions instead of being forced/ brainwash or coerced to believe a certain way especially at a young age. </p>
<p>I would like them to grow up, decide and think  for themselves at an appropriate age as to whether or not they would like to do something or not. </p>
<p>I would hope for my kids to of course make the decision I see best fit for them, but I am also want to allow them to think for themselves at a certain age even if I don’t agree with that and I’m not sure my bf is on the same boat about that on certain things like allowing them to choose to vax and think for themselves in regards to education for instance to name a few. </p>
<p>On a side note he has an issue with setting boundaries with his mom, who is pro vax and very hard headed. I am somewhat afraid he will also allow her unwanted interference into our relationship and family we raise as we’ve already had issues with her in the past. </p>
<p>These are mainly issues that have came up since the chaos has erupted over these past few years. We do both value other similar things like family, financial conservatism, organization, etc.</p>
<p>I’m worried that his or my comprising will turn resentment in the end because we are so at odds with many things.</p>

        <p>My girlfriend and I have opposing viewpoints. When we started dating I was all for Trump and she was a Hillary fan. Sure we clashed on a lot of things but we worked through it. After all this craziness we’ve both gone more libertarian than anything else. She’s vaccinated and I’m not, we respect each others view on the matter and she even jokes about waking me up in the morning screaming “you don’t love me if you don’t take the vaccine” and then we both laugh. 
But yeah we have opposing viewpoints and I think it’s a good and healthy thing because we can debate rationally, it also keeps things spicy lol</p>

        <p>My family are all with opposite views to me, but they respect my views and decisions, as I do theirs. We don't agree with each other, but that's fine. </p>
<p>Sometimes if things get brought up from either view, it usually just results in eyerolls  or a "well, I dont agree with thar" and thats that.</p>

        <p>Yeh see thats usually what its like with my grandma and the rest of my family but with my bf its a bit more worrisome to me that its been coming increasingly more obvious progressing into these chaotic times that we have some opposing views. </p>
<p>Before the pandemic I didn’t think our views were that skewed although now I am beginning reconsider if this is something I want to stay in long term or not. Idk that I want to raise kid in an environment where opposing views are tearing apart a family. I’m afraid we will not grow together but apart. Its not that I want this but I have to be realistic about the reality.</p>

        <p>My aunt was into QAnon. She was big on the covid is a hoax thing and a major Trump supporter. We had a total falling out. A few months ago my mind did a 180 flip on the covid situation and I reached out to her and now we message each other about this stuff almost every day. My cousin (her daughter) and her husband both got the vaxx… my cousins husband messaged me out of the blue one day after finding out I messaged my auntie and berated me for not taking the vaccine… told me being on “her side” was just going to embolden her and make her feel like she was right. I told him I’m not on anybody’s “side”… I make up my own mind. </p>
<p>He just had a baby with my cousin. He’s been randomly bringing up Satanism and how he respects it for the past year or so because of how it’s all “symbolic” and the whole “we are putting an idol of Baphomet or whatever up because it is hypocritical of the secular state to put up Christian symbols etc and discriminate against satanism… then he tells me about how it’s so great because it’s all about the individual and “not anything like what people think it is”, and they have their own commandments that are supposedly much better than the Christian ones.</p>
<p>So I’m talking to my auntie and she tells me that the last time she went over there, he blew up at her (they have been totally against each other over all of this kind of differing ideologies), told her he is a satanist and that he is going to teach my cousin’s/his daughter about it.</p>
<p>So that’s my life and the world I live in. How’s it going for everyone else?</p>
