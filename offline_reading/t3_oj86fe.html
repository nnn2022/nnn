    <strong>Family member who has been living overseas on and off for the past decade now will not remove mask from her or her children upon returning to the US</strong>
    <p><p>So a cousin has lived in a <em>very</em> mask-friendly country overseas for the better part of 10 years (with a few lengthy breaks) has just returned to the US for a few months. Whenever we have Skyped over the past year and a half, she has expressed her suspicion that she thinks most of the first worlds‚Äô response to Covid has been ridiculously overblown , and that 90% of the media information is manipulative fear mongering.  We were always on the same page with how insane the government overreach had become in both countries. </p>
<p>Well imagine my surprise when she returns to the states after a year and a half and refuses to remove her mask 
<em>and</em> will also force her 2 young kids to keep wearing theirs when out in public.  The mandates were lifted in my state over a month ago, and our city is not a particularly crowded one.  95% of people stopped wearing them.  I‚Äôm only mildly annoyed that she still feels the need to wear one , but I find it pretty irksome that she forces them on her very young children.  It also gets under my skin because I know that she does it for image more than anything.  </p>
<p>Mask-wearing has always been a normal thing in the country that she is an expat in , with many people even wearing them just to feel anonymous or as a fashion statement.  I know she is not truly that afraid of covid, as she has confided that she thinks she might have already had it.  I wonder if there‚Äôs a way to convince her to atleast drop the masks from her kids, as I can tell that the oldest one at least does not want to wear his when he‚Äôs out in public here seeing other young kids not wearing them.   (and I know it‚Äôs performative because when me and other friends/family members are visiting her small condo and hugging and kissing, she doesn‚Äôt bother with the masks - it‚Äôs only when out in public in the fresh air with the closest person several feet away. ü§¨)</p>
<p>Just for some more background info, The far-away country that she spends most of her time in is in no way culturally similar to ours or her family background, which kind of just adds to the annoyance and peculiarity of the situation now that she is back in her home city and can let her hair down for once.</p></p>

        <p>The worst thing about all of this is that people got used to the idea that ‚Äúmandates‚Äù are to be respected and followed. </p>
<p>That‚Äôs not American at all. That‚Äôs dictatorial.</p>

        <p>But the mask doesn't protect the wearer from the virus it protects others from the wearer ...  </p>
<p>It's got that ancient aliens uni-directional air filtration technologies virus can go in but not out. ü§î</p>

        <p>Some people wear masks in other countries because of pollutants everywhere.  Is she just used to doing something like this, since she only wears it outside?</p>
<p>If I visited one of the more populated and industrial cities in China, I‚Äôd probably mask up with a filter myself. It‚Äôs definitely not fresh air you‚Äôd be breathing while walking around.</p>
