    <strong>Covid Vaccine Passports UK</strong>
    <p><p>So I have just found out the news that vaccine passports in the uk are real now. It means that anyone who is not vaccinated can't go to nightclubs, pubs and music venues. This is targeting the younger generations and bribing them to get their jab in fear of losing their social lives and general freedom. </p>
<p>I honestly knew this was going to happen but it doesn't make it any easier to deal with. How are you all going to deal with this?</p>
<p>We are now in an authoritarian country. It feels as though we are heading towards a dictatorship involving old rich men who play games with our lives. </p>
<p>What do we do? It's especially worse being in London. How on earth do we deal with people who are so oblivious to the propaganda and manipulation. The adverts on tele make me sick to my stomach. </p>
<p>There is so much hidden knowledge and its not accessible. I am pro choice but the government have not given anyone the chance to have a choice.</p>
<p>They blame the young because its their easiest claim coming from perverted old men. We need young people in power.</p>
<p>Let there be another 60s/70s revolution. I want to arrange a 'festival' for us to all embrace our knowledge and individuality. Anyone interested in building a team of freedom fighters?</p></p>

        <p>What seems to be the tactic at the moment is that the government says something (like this) but doesn’t make it law. Then the media make it sound like it’s law and people then do what they’re told. This is actually quite simple and efficient of them. The government can’t be blamed if anything goes wrong in the future because by law you were free to do what you want. And the media are ‘only reporting what they think is true’ so they are covered by free speech. </p>
<p>Add to that the big pharma company’s are exempt from any prosecution if things go terribly wrong, they have it all sewn up. The responsibility rests with YOU. Resist the FEAR. ‘Fear is the mind killer, the little bit of death that brings total obliteration……….’</p>

        <p>It won't stop at clubs and pubs... it will probably be extended to many other venues. As a church minister, myself and many others wrote a letter to parliament several months ago. In the letter we stated in no uncertain terms, that if churches were forced to use Passports for entry, we would commit civil disobedience.</p>

        <p>As the vax percentage goes up, the extremes against those of us who say no will get worse and worse.</p>
<p>There is something bad in these vaccines and it is critical to them that they get them into every person.</p>
<p>My advice is to hold out long enough that the long term side effects become well known, and we may have more support then.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the dehumanization against us may solidify a permanent and subconscious hate and rage against us that common sense, logic, and reason can never undo.</p>

        <p>I can see that occurring.  People have been manipulated into fearing normal life. Group think is surprisingly powerful.</p>

        <p>I don't need the jab, I've had Covid and I have the immunity from that.</p>
<p>But I feel like I'm going to be forced into taking the experimental drug either way, because I want to be able to travel. I doubt the UK vaccine passports will get very far in this country but the whole of Europe is refusing access to the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your reply but around late November there was a petition with over 300,000 signatures. Me and my partner looked at the data and most signatures came from London. They 'debated' it in a video which was uploaded and it was just full of mockery and carelessness. Then a few days later they announced total lockdown only on London once again. I feel its just supplying them with our location and ideologies. We are handing over ourselves as easy targets by signing. I will however sign only hoping for change.</p>

        <p>Which is what a "vaccine" passport will do, it will just give them more control and more information</p>
<p>Hopelessness is one of their biggest weapons, they created an atmosphere of fear and hopelessness and then give you hope only to withdraw it, its a classic psyop technique to wear you down - dont let them win ....</p>
