        <p>When you start digging into AIDS/HIV you will find an incredible rabbit hole of controversy which has largely been hidden from us.</p>
<p>You'll find that knowingly transmitting HIV to someone is being decriminalized around the country:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/09/knowingly-infecting-others-with-hiv-is-no-longer-a-felony-in-california-advocates-say-it-targeted-sex-workers/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/10/09/knowingly-infecting-others-with-hiv-is-no-longer-a-felony-in-california-advocates-say-it-targeted-sex-workers/</a></p>
<p>You'll also find our own CDC advising that HIV transmission be decriminalized:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html</a></p>
<p>Then you'll find the average cost of lifetime treatment for someone becoming infected with HIV is \~$325,000:</p>
<p>HIV drugs cost \~$15k to $40k per year.</p>
<p>And if you look up Kary Mullis (novel prize winner) you'll find out he was incredibly critical of Dr. Fauci -- and was also critical of how the PCR test which he invented was being used incorrectly.</p>
<p>Sadly, he died shortly before all of the Covid-19 stuff began so we can't hear his input today -- but given his lifelong battle with Fauci and skepticism around how his test was used for HIV, he would surely be critical.</p>

        <p>I'm not directly affected by the HIV issue so I haven't fully explored it (although I'm sure Google thinks I have it based on my searches, lol)</p>
<p>But that said -- like everything, I'm sure there are many issues at play here:</p>
<p>1) HIV / AIDS may have been exaggerated somehow, to begin with. Looking back, the HIV fear campaign is awfully similar to the "War on Terror" and Covid-19</p>
<p>2) Big Pharma certainly wants to profit, and surely puts money toward thinktanks &amp; casual dating websites which encourage behaviors that lead to the spread</p>
<p>3) HIV treatment has advanced, supposedly, and given that it isn't a death sentence anymore (?) maybe that's why our government, who cares so much about us, wants to decriminalize transmission.</p>
<p>HOWEVER... Consider this.</p>
<p>If you steal something from someone for around \~$750 or so (depending on the state) you will have committed a felony. That's a one-time cost to the victim.</p>
<p>Yet somehow, deliberate transmission of HIV -- which leads a person to $10k to $40k per year in treatments... is a misdemeanor?!</p>
<p>I try not to be a "conspiracy theorist" but what am I supposed to do with that knowledge? </p>
<p>Really compare those two crimes and tell me which is worse...?</p>
<p>Nothing makes sense anymore -- most likely because we're deep into late stage capitalism and everyone is grabbing money while they can so they can be in a good place when it all collapses.</p>
<p>After all, collapse it will. Those business shutdowns? The cyberhack cutting gas off to the east coast?</p>
<p>Those are real world tests, to see how people &amp; the economy responds to these issues because "the big one" -- the big financial crisis -- is coming.</p>
<p>But it won't be what they say it is. "The end of the dollar." Skyrocketing inflation. No... It's looking more and more like they will actually raise interest rates to protect the dollar, which will set off a chain reaction of events that lead to the kind of business closures and lockdowns we lived through for the last year.</p>
<p>And... I'm sure they'll blame it on a virus. Maybe an "alien virus." (Have you noticed the surge in silly "UFO" reports in the media? They must be planning something with that...)</p>

        <p>Curious as to your thoughts on why they would rather raise interest rates and directly contribute to the resultant crash, rather than continue inflation? At least with inflation they can blame others (supply chain hacks, hoarders, etc) for the result?</p>

        <p>Until yesterday I thought the same way as you. Everything has been telling us to expect endless inflation, zero interest rates long term, even negative interest rates. At the same time, we see the stock market skyrocketing and everyone wants to get in on it. We see cryptos rising, and we get FOMO. Apps like Robinhood emerge. Yay! An opportunity for normal people to get into trading, so finally they can invest and make gains like the wealthy have been doing forever!</p>
<p>But... I realized this may very well all be a setup. Remember, "real life" often goes in the opposite direction they tell us.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it could be that normal people are getting into the markets as concentrated wealth are pulling out. That way, normal people are left holding overpriced assets when the correction happens -- and people of wealth do what they've always done, profited with inside knowledge about what is actually happening.</p>
<p>Regarding the Fed --- it could certainly go the way you're saying. That is one possibility. It's what everyone thinks is going to happen. We've been not subtly warned that this is the direction.</p>
<p>And THAT'S why I'm skeptical.</p>
<p>With the gas shortage on east coast -- it reminded me of what was happening around the time I was born.  Very high interest rates.</p>
<p>And suddenly it dawned on me:</p>
<p>Concentrated wealth have increased their holding of dollars, by selling as middle class people buy in.</p>
<p>If interest rates rise, their dollar value increases and the assets will fall in value. Now they can exercise the incredible purchase power of currency which is gaining in value.</p>
<p>It means they can buy houses, businesses, assets.</p>
<p>I thought -- why did we have forced business closures? It wasn't about the virus. It was preparing for what's to come.</p>
<p>What would cause widespread business closures in the future? The chain reaction that will occur when they raise interest rates to slow inflation and save the dollar.</p>
<p>So yes, I think there's at LEAST a 50% chance that the Fed will go in this direction, polar opposite from what we've been told they will do.</p>
<p>Their preparation would suggest that. The business closures. The gas shortages. The experiments with UBI. The bolstered police force and lockdowns to deal with protesters and economic unrest.</p>

        <p>That's a nice thing to say, but realistically it's an echo chamber. I don't believe we change opinions with our activities on the internet...</p>
<p>HOWEVER... Likeminded people do trade insight with one another that helps them gain a greater understanding of what is happening.</p>
<p>Arguing with the army of strange people who advocate the Covid-19 response online? It's an incredible waste of time. I have to downvote and move on. They have nothing to contribute but noise and free spread of the propaganda machine. They're like NPCs. You argue with them and get the same talking points - never EVER any unique or original contribution - and then it just ends with "Wear your @#@$ing mask"</p>

        <p>I can’t get the links to work but what he said in that red box is such garbage.   ... or persons with risks for AIDS. What does that even mean? If it’s spread thru sexual contact why are children getting it outside of having been born to a +mother. This is definitely worth a 2nd look.</p>
