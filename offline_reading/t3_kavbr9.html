        <p>as you say vaccine studies in general i can share a few interesting ones to look at, in case you haven't  come across them yet:</p>

<p>aluminium specific papers:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X19304201?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X19304201?via%3Dihub</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0946672X17308763</a> </p>
<p>also when reading garbage and trying to find out what studies are garbage, i can suggest to not fall for the title or the abstract and always look at methods of course.</p>
<p>lots of garbage "studies" will claim to have used a placebo, but when you actually read the study you will find out, that it was another poisonous vaccine or it was everything in the vaccine, except for the antigens, or it was just neurotoxic aluminium.</p>
<p>as you are probably aware using poison in the control group means, that you can hide any effects from the vaccines, because they can happen at roughly the same amount in the control group and vaccine group, because both are getting poison and no one is getting an inert-placebo like saline.</p>
<p>also be aware of healthy use bias for NON randomized studies:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ektfe1/healthy_user_bias_explains_why_the_mmrautism/">https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/ektfe1/healthy_user_bias_explains_why_the_mmrautism/</a> </p>
<p>and be aware of the importance of using fully unvaccinated children in control groups. this would be REQUIRED if one would actually want to know overall health outcomes from vaccines.</p>
<p>if this isn't done, then you could be comparing one child getting 40 vaccines and the other child getting 39 vaccines and claim, that the difference isn't much if noticeable at all.</p>
<p>the 666 homeschooled children pilot study used fully unvaccinted children as control group. this makes it very unique and important, despite being a small pilot study.</p>
<p>if you are not aware of it yet, there has been a refusal to do any RCTs using inert placebos and using fully unvaccinated children as control groups for decades now actually.</p>
<p>they will NOT do these gold standard studies, because they already know the result, that would come out of them and all the smaller studies shown of course already paint a pretty sad picture.</p>
<p>i hope this added some interesting studies to go over in your deep dive :)</p>

        <p>I think you beat me to it! Wow thanks man. Where I’m at right now is working out this specious reasoning “loop” as I’d call it around SAEs, or more specifically, how and why they always seem to magically be either “statistically insignificant” or “unrelated.” Again though wow thank you!</p>

        <p>&rt;  how and why they always seem to magically be either “statistically insignificant” or “unrelated."</p>
<p>i can suggest to look at the pharma connections between governments and the pharma industry as one of the explanations for this.</p>
<p>i would also suggest to look at a 2nd explanation for it, which is, that the people behind the vaccines and mass vaccination campaigns like bill gates want people sick or dead or sterilized and they of course will do everything to prevent serious adverse events being brought to the awareness of the public.</p>
<p>to better understand this part i can highly suggest this documentary:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/">https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/</a> </p>
<p>it also has a fully references transcript to go over.</p>
<p>on a lower level like smaller researchers or doctors and nurses i can hypothesize here and say, that it is the religious believe in vaccines.</p>
<p>most doctors and nurses only have half a day on vaccines if that and they never learn about the serious adverse events. they never learn about any of this.</p>
<p>mots don't even know vaers exist! (usa vaccine adverse event reporting system)</p>
<p>vaers is a deliberate dumpster fire btw to avoid adverse events getting properly recorded.</p>
<p>and doctors and nurses and the public get told, that "vaccines saved humanity from smallpox and polio"</p>
<p>and they will religiously defend vaccines as a great defender of humanity, because that is the believe, that they got pushed into.</p>
<p>if a child dies dies within 1 day of the vaccines, then to those religious people it CAN'T be the vaccines. it is impossible to them in their mind.</p>
<p>tons of doctors and nurses aren't even aware of what is in vaccines. they think, that there is a tiny bit of harmless antigen and the rest is saline.</p>
<p>they don't  even know, that they injected neurotoxins into the child, that died  within 1 day or a few days after the vaccine.</p>
<p>some real researchers even  said, that</p>
<p>"even if a child dies with the vaccine needle still in their arm, the doctor would still not call it a vaccine death"</p>
<p>also tons of doctors and nurses have vaccinated children for many many years. this makes it less likely for them to wake up to the harm, that they caused through them.</p>
<p>and there is also the fear of losing their job, their careers and reputation.</p>
<p>big examples were done to get doctors and nurses into fear about researching and speaking out about vaccines. for example the famous dr. andrew wakefield case and the lancet paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QStVUlKT34&amp;feature=emb_logo</a> </p>
<p>and as i mentioned smallpox and polio as the old saviors, that can't be questioned and makes the current vaccines perfect miracles too, in the eyes of the blind believers, i'd like to share  2 presentation on those.</p>
<p>smallpox presentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oot0HUqMcs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oot0HUqMcs</a> </p>
<p>polio presentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns&amp;t=3121s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns</a></p>
<p>both are fully references, but the polio one has really bad quality, so it might be hard to read some of the references.</p>
<p>and one last important study, that i should have put into my first comment, but fits into here now:</p>
<p>&rt;Correlation between Non-Polio Acute Flaccid Paralysis Rates with Pulse Polio Frequency in India:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/</a> </p>
<p>&rt;  A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional <strong>491,000 paralyzed children</strong> above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP. </p>
<p>( non-polio acute flaccid paralysis  = NPAFP)</p>
<p>&rt; The response to the reduction in OPV rounds (de-challenging) adds credence to the assumption that OPV was responsible for the change in the NPAFP rate. </p>
<p>basically bill gates ran a huge polio vaccination program in india and paralyzed 490000 children!</p>
<p>if the old definition of polio would be used, then it would actually read:</p>
<p>"polio vaccinations in india caused 490000 cases of polio", but with the introduction of the polio vaccines they changed the definition of what polio is, so that they can fake the polio vaccines to appear successful.</p>
<p>also if you are bored or know anyone who is pregnant or wants to get a baby, then you can also watch this 6 part presentation on infant immunity as part of your research:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4co1kNVKU&amp;list=PLgH2vCx5TOgWuQtnPkwtwgrn5D-2pjhgc&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4co1kNVKU&amp;list=PLgH2vCx5TOgWuQtnPkwtwgrn5D-2pjhgc&amp;index=1</a> </p>
<p>while it seems a bit unrelated.</p>
<p>i would argue it isn't. understanding, that babies are wonderfully protected early on in life  through breastmilk and that vaccines massively interfere with their development and DELIBERATELY lowered immune system responses is important to understand, to understand how insane vaccinations in babies truly are. (mother is providing the immune system to babies during this development period)</p>
<p>i mean i could straight up say, that they want to neurologically damage babies (SAEs like you say), because then there is little to no way to prove, that it was the vaccines, that harmed them.</p>
<p>doing the same on teenagers or adults  through the HPV vaccines for example is kind of an issue, because they can already talk, so when they die or get their life destroyed, then you could be dealing with a kind of PR issue for your injections full of poison.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hpv-yakugai.net/english/">https://www.hpv-yakugai.net/english/</a> </p>
<p>so doing vaccines as early as possible means no one will know about the damages. doing them during pregnancy is of course an option too, if your goal would be to harm babies and mothers.</p>
<p>however i feel like this is to much speculation on motives at this point by me i guess :)</p>
<p>but yeah  i hope i gave you some perspective on the deliberately ignoring of SAEs from vaccines and go over the presentations if you want. they are great and extremely well researched.</p>

        <p>Kary Mullis is a so-called "aids denier", which means that he doesn't believe that the HIV virus is the cause of Aids... a claim that became popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Duesberg">Peter Duesberg</a> during the late '90s.</p>
<p>The notion that AIDS is caused by the HIv virus is largely based on questionable research associated with Fauci, and the statements Mullis made in the fragment shown is from an interview Mullis made on HIV not causing AIDS.</p>

        <p>FYI here is his obituary. He seems like a really cool guy. I’d have loved to sit and chat with him:</p>
<p>Kary B. Mullis, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, died Aug. 7 of pneumonia at the age of 74. He won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for copying and amplifying DNA. Mullis invented the PCR method in 1983 as a chemist at Cetus Corporation.</p>
<p>The original version of PCR that Mullis developed uses repeated cycles of elevated temperatures to separate DNA strands, which are then copied by a heat-stable DNA polymerase. Repeating the cycle many times leads to an exponential increase in the quantity of DNA. In this way, even traces of DNA can be amplified into amounts that can be easily sequenced or quantified.</p>
<p>PCR amplification played a key role in the Human Genome Project, in which most of the DNA blueprint of one person was sequenced.</p>
<p>“The initial scientific goals of the Human Genome Project were actually established before PCR had become a routine laboratory method,” says Eric D. Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health and participant in the Human Genome Project. “In retrospect, the widespread development of PCR-based methods ultimately turned out to be critical—in many ways essential—for the Project’s success.”</p>
<p>PCR also made its mark in forensic science. “Prior to the development of the PCR, forensic scientists utilized very awkward and insensitive techniques” to identify people from DNA samples, says Bruce McCord, a professor of forensic chemistry at Florida International University. “The development of the PCR revolutionized forensic DNA testing. Suddenly there was no need for radioactivity or chemiluminescence-based detection, as the PCR could produce millions of copies of DNA from only a few cells.”</p>
<p>Beyond his work on PCR, Mullis was also known for his controversial views disputing humans’ role in climate change and HIV’s role in AIDS. He also was open about taking hallucinogenic drugs like LSD and synthesizing some when in graduate school.</p>
<p>Mullis was born in Lenoir, North Carolina, in 1944. He received a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1966 and a PhD in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1972. He joined Cetus in 1979. In 1986, he became the director of molecular biology at Xytronyx. And starting in 1987, he worked as a consultant on nucleic acid chemistry for multiple companies.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, three children, and two grandchildren.</p>
