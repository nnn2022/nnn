    <strong>Just flew in to San Diego, and I expected to see a lot more people wearing masks.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm visiting some family in southern CA (I've been living in the Midwest since before Covid), and I'm extremely surprised by the number of people who aren't wearing any masks at all. </p>
<p>I took a walk around Mission Bay, and I completely expected to be the only one there not wearing a mask, but the mask-wearers were actually the minority.</p>
<p>Anyway, this put me in a pretty good mood, and I just wanted to share this experience with you guys. I'm glad there's still some sanity in Commie-fornia.</p></p>
