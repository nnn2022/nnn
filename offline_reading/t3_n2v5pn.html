    <strong>Fearmongering is Maliciously Targeting the Mentally Fragile</strong>
    <p><p>As the media starts backpedalling a bit on the fear-mongering I'm starting to notice who among my friend group have been permanently damaged by the past year. Most people who were what you would consider "neurotypical" before all this are pretty much fine, and even if they're politically liberal they're eager to get out and enjoy company. But there are two or three who seem like they've been scared to the point that they'll never get over the paranoia, all of whom had some mental trauma or abnormality before 2020. Even if you're strong enough to know what's bullshit, there are people out there who aren't, and that's what pisses me off the most about this. I'll never forgive them for the friends I lost.</p></p>

        <p>I think there's always been a good portion of people who are that way, a lot actually. That's why it's important to have a healthy culture that encourages healthy behaviour. Once culture becomes corrupted and anti-human only people who are confident in their judgments and beliefs can survive. And that's really sad b/c many times fragile people offer a lot of value and creativity in their own way. Sort of feel like it's our duty to protect them.</p>

        <p>Yes but now there's such a de-emphasizing of winning because it victimized people who don't win; the invention of things like microaggressions and the empowerment of victim status.</p>
<p>There are other facets to the social experimentation being conducted on the population- especially the youngest like the normalizing of mental illness.  The aim seems to be producing a population that is unable to cope with life. </p>
<p>Some young folks are in fact pushing back but a significant number seem to be getting effectively programmed by the poison to some extent.</p>

        <p>I had been speaking with my wife about this as early as 2 weeks into the lock down, pontificating on the ramifications of an extended period of this bullshit.</p>
<p>The fact we're more than a year into it at this point is an absolutely terrifying thing to me, largely in part for the consequences that we will see years down the road. The psychological damage that has been wrought is with no doubt immense and has been administered on a nearly world wide basis.</p>
<p>Remain strong, knowing that you see the forest through the trees, friend. Be strong for those around you. Remain a beacon of courage for others to see light in the dark. All these things shall come to pass.</p>
