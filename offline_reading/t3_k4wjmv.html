    <strong>About to get married, worried about the future if we have children...?</strong>
    <p><p>Basically as the title says, I’m planning on getting married when we move back home from where we are in about 6 months. We’d like to maybe have a baby afterwards. All this stuff about kids having to do computer school or having to social distance and wear masks to school is really freaking me out. It’s wrong in so many ways, children need that interaction with their peers and teachers! </p>
<p>So basically I’m wondering what you guys think... will this become a normal thing? Do you think this will continue permanently? Or if not, do you think these things may be implemented in the future if another virus becomes prevalent? I’ve really started to question whether I even want to have children because of all this. Please feel free to discuss what you think, I always wanted to have a kid but this nonsense is truly making me second guess that.</p></p>

        <p>I had a miscarriage in December last year, it was very hard for me and I was so depressed. But honestly? If I gave birth during this whole ordeal and had a child now I don’t think I could sleep at night. I think true evil is running amok in the world now. The consequences of children entering the world without the ability to see humans as they should be (with facial expressions) and entering a world full of tech everywhere and no medical autonomy... sounds like literal hell.</p>

        <p>Fair enough, but that’s easier said than done. Our lives are so short and I always wanted that to be a part of mine. I don’t think it’s really right for my own life and dreams to be determined by the social climate. I don’t want to have a hundred kids, but it’s a natural feeling most of us have that I should have the right to experience :/</p>

<p>A child is not a pet. A child is not an item on a bucket list. A child is a living being that YOU are responsible for a long, long time. </p>
<p>No matter how much money you may have saved up, how secure you think your job is, you cant control the current political environment. We are in the rumblings of a world war where a medical tyranny is taking over. Did you not notice? </p>
<p>You want your life to be pregnant through that? you want a baby to be witness to that? You are not goign to have a happy little ikea life. </p>
<p>Yes you have a right as human to have a child and yes its a natural desire, but please dont have a child because YOU think you are entitled to it because of your dreams. </p>
<p>Based on yoru comments i think you are extremely naive on the current movement going on in the world right now</p>

        <p>For as stupid as things are right now, the world is still an awesome place. I wouldn't hesitate bringing kids into the world. 99.9% of humans who have ever lived would kill to live during our time. By nearly every metric things are better now than they ever have been. Sure, it's far from perfect, and we are dealing with some serious BS at the moment, but I still think children in the past had to deal with way worse stuff than what children are dealing with now. And it will be the upcoming generations that ultimately will change the world, so the more children raised by people who recognize the insanity of what is going on, the better. There is strength in numbers. For me having children through all of this (I have 4 elementary school aged kids) has made this nightmare so much more tolerable. Kids give a new level of purpose to everything you do, and they really help give you perspective. And kids are super resilient. My kids all think masks are stupid and are not at all concerned about covid. And I do feel like there is more momentum for kids going back to school and getting back to normal. Luckily my kids have in person school. They have to wear masks, and there are dumb social distancing policies, but for the most part those things have been minor inconveniences. In the end I would try not to focus on all the negatives. It's easy to fall into the same fear traps that doomers are stuck in. It leads to misery.  Kids are a great way to help ignore all the stupidity that surrounds us and focus on what really matters.</p>

        <p>you also gotta remember it takes about 9 months to have a kid, even longer if she doesn't conceive right away, and they don't go to school until they are 5. You are looking about 5-7 years before they actually go to school</p>

        <p>By this point it should be considered child abuse to send your kid to a US public school. I think anyone considering children should be prepared to homeschool them. Unfortunately even that could become impossible; once the left has complete control in the USA it wouldn't be surprising if they banned homeschooling all together.</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about homeschooling, in fact that’s what I’d like to do. But when I see all this doomsday rhetoric it makes me reconsider the idea of having a kid entirely. Which tbh really sucks for us normal people who just want to experience life and share it with a child.</p>

        <p>I came to a similar conclusion and decided that having children now simply isn't fair to the child. Unless I could provide an environment completely separated from this insanity it just wouldn't be right.</p>

        <p>Enjoy time as a married couple a while before having kids. As you may have heard, it changes things :)</p>
<p>For the first couple years, very little they can do is likely to impact your kids. So you have time to decide if you need to find a freer state or country.</p>
<p>It's too early for you to need to worry about this imho.</p>

        <p>That does make it a more difficult decision.  I was 37 when I had my first and I'm very conscious of my age.  It takes a lot more effort to stay in shape so I can be active with them.</p>
<p>Hopefully the years before school becomes an issue give you enough time to be confident you're in a place you're comfortable raising children.  Who knows, maybe we'll all be in south dakota by then (because florida is just too hot and occasionally quite windy).</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

        <p>I have been married for awhile and we are both really wanting children at the moment. We are holding off specifically because of the current state of the world, and even more so because of where we live and how our state is handling it (California is peak absurdity). </p>
<p>I have younger nephew (pre-k), and I cannot overstate how negatively this has affected him. The older ones are still struggling, but he is doing the worst. He was perfectly fine and happy previously, but the lack of socialization and the masking is really taking a toll. He has tantrums throughout the day and is not the same child. I believe the treatment of children during this time is extreme child abuse, and while they are extremely resilient, I do not think something this unnatural will go without consequences in regards to their development. The older ones seems completely checked out in a way they were not before. The only thing that helps is getting them out in nature with other kids from reasonable families, and letting them run and play like normal children. </p>
<p>I can't answer this very personal question for you, but I do think it's important that intelligent people like you continue to have children and give them a stable and normal life, so we can have some functioning members of society. </p>
<p>For me, I am focusing on three major things: </p>
<p>1) I am stashing away every penny I can to send them to a private school when I do have them. I have seen how the public schools are treating these kids and it is deplorable, I would never send my child there. If I can't save enough I will homeschool them with other local children. </p>
<p>2) I am doing everything I can to relocate to Florida or New Hampshire as soon as possible. A positive of this whole clown show is that we know exactly what locations will and will not tolerate this, and it is attracting like-minded people to those areas, improving them further. If your community is like-minded that's a huge win. </p>
<p>3) I am focusing a lot on the property surrounding homes now. I would buy a shack if it came with a big yard. I live in a very urban area and the kids are visibly upset compared to more country areas. If insanity persists, at least my kids will have a big property to enjoy. </p>
<p>Apologies for the diary entry, I hope it is helpful in some way.</p>

        <p>THANK YOU. seriously your diary entry is helpful. My plan is actually to move to a more rural area where we can have some acres to be free and away from everything. You guys should try to do the same if you really want children (which is a natural feeling when you are with someone you love!). I am originally from Kansas and came to Southern California for my fiancé’s schooling/work, we are planning on going back when he’s done (my family lives there). You see the affect it is having on your nephew, my fiancé’s nephew is experiencing the same. You are totally on the right track looking for a property where you have a yard or land. That’s the best way to assure your children a true childhood of adventure and freedom. Thank you for your thoughts! Maybe we could talk more about it sometime.</p>

<p>I think that's something you and your partner need to discuss together, rather than with us. </p>
<p>But since you asked, while I'm single, I have been thinking a lot about how I would not be ok bringing a child into this world right now because I don't like the trajectory we are on and they are the ones who will suffer for it. I would definitely consider adoption or foster care if I were in the place to.</p>

        <p>No, this will be over soon enough. I wouldn’t plan your family around all of this! I will say that there is a definite fast growing “anti child” sentiment brewing in the US...people no longer wanting to pay for public schools (because they are just childcare! Etc) and other things. So- be prepared to go it a lot more on your own (compared to when we were growing up). If you live near family/friends that is ideal. Good luck!</p>

        <p>There's no good time to have a baby. So have a baby.</p>
<p>Seriously, have babies early and often. The fear of having babies because of tyranny isn't that different from brainiacs who won't have babies because of climate change or racism. Our overlords don't want us to procreate because our children are the only reason to care about the future.</p>

        <p>Remember that kids don’t start school until age 5 so you’d still have a while before they would go back. I don’t believe most people will put up with this much longer. I see the cracks are getting bigger and more open rebellion. You can’t predict the future but I wouldn’t not have one if it’s something you want. You still have six months til the wedding and it can take time to get pregnant.</p>

        <p>If you want to have kids, have them! If you keep waiting "for the right time", that time isn't going to happen.</p>
<p>It is a scary time. Things are such a mess in the world and it seems like kids are bearing the brunt of it. Even with this, we're TTC right now. We live rural; 5 acre "hobby" farm. So glad we got out of the city a few years ago. Grow and raise ~85% of our food. We're still back and forth on whether private or home schooling. There's no way public school is happening.  </p>

        <p>There's a vaccine now so it'll be over soon. This was all just a thing to blame trump and get him out. Now bidem will be a "hero" and save the country. 2 days after biden won they said there's a new vaccine ready. So don't worry. Plus by the time your kids are ready for school it'll be years later.</p>

        <p>I won't tell you what to do or not do, but imo this is just the beginning. I don't know what's coming next, but I feel things are going to get very ugly in the next ten years. The many problems that brought us here are not being solved, and are getting worse. I've never been a doomer, fwiw.</p>

        <p>I have a 1.5 year old son. So far about half of his life has been shadowed by this stuff. If I knew the future back when I conceived him I still would have chosen to do it. I always wanted a family, my son is an absolute light and joy of my life, and he is very happy. You can’t control the world but you can control your life and family. I hate what’s happening in the world but there’s no war on our soil and we are fortunate to have job security with our education and experience. I would feel a lot worse for my son if he was used to a different world and was forced into making changes. I feel bad for kids in school. I personally believe that this shit will be over by the time my son goes to school (and the child you have, if you choose to) so that’s my main concern (as a homeschooled kid who wants nothing more than socialization in my kids educational experience...). </p>
<p>I think it’s a good idea to plan for a child when you’re ready. A tip unrelated to the state of things...maybe give it a few months after marriage. It was advice I ignored, along with “the first year of having a baby is the hardest on your marriage” which is absolutely true. When you do be prepared for the shock and remember that it gets easier at 6 months old and amazing at 1 year plus.</p>

<p>The people that shouldn't be breeding always want to, and the smart ones that realize the philosophical and ethical ramifications of such, are the ones with the genes we need to be propagating.</p>

        <p>Even after covid vaccines become a thing, lockdowns will continue for a number of years in some areas whenever a government thinks that there is an 'excess' of covid cases. It can't be said for certain, but lockdowns or restrictions in every-day life may become the norm for other things deemed as 'emergencies' such as excess CO2 emissions, pollution and garbage waste.</p>
<p>I see the world becoming more anti-social in the future. Virtual learning will first be deemed a temporary measure to deal with lack of social distancing and teaching staff. And then, as we all know, some problems take too long to get solved, and you'll have a lot of students growing up on mostly online school. This lack of socialisation is going to be detrimental to society in the future. And I've already seen how some boomers in high positions are totally ignorant to how people and systems function because school in their day was just about memorization and books. No creativity, no projects, nothing.</p>
<p>And in general, the comfortable life we know in the West will definitely be disrupted in our lifetime. You can't predict where wars will strike, what diseases will surface, how bad recessions will be, what disasters will happen.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of people are thankfully not creating any new lives on an overpopulated earth. I would strongly urge you to adopt.</p>
