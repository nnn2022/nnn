    <strong>What is so bad about wearing a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>Legitimate question. I am not trying to force an opinion, I'd just like to see what people think. If masks work, they save thousands of lives. If they don't, you are just wearing a piece of cloth for no reason. Is the inconvenience really not worth the potential lives saved?</p></p>

        <p>Yes, wearing a mask for hours when you go to the park, in humid December, is a minor incovenience. Being afraid that you are fined for taking it off to breath clean air is also a minor incovenience.</p>
<p>Wearing it 8 hours at work or more? Another minor incovenience. Month after month of this? Minor. Vaccination coming up but masks still mandated? Minor. Weakening your immune system for months, to protect those who should stay home? Incovenience!</p>

        <p>There are lots of people who can't stay home because they are essential workers. If masks weaken your immune system, why have surgeons worn them for years, when they're in contact with sick people every day? Even if masks did weaken your immune system, I would be willing to risk myself a little if it meant saving lives.</p>

        <p>Please understand the dynamics involved instead of trying to tease out one thing and make a splash with it. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask for your job (a surgeon let’s say) a handful of hours a day is not a problem. Wearing it all the time unnecessarily will weaken your immune system.  To function properly, our immune systems must be exposed to pathogens to train the immune response. </p>
<p>COVID has a survival rate &rt;99% for healthy people.  The mask is unnecessary and is not about safety but compliance.  I will never stand for that rhetoric and will defy mask mandates. </p>
<p>Just to clear things up, you’re not saving anyone’s life. Turn off your TV and go live your life.</p>

        <p>A surgeon spends way more time a day wearing a mask than the majority of people. A surgeon spends most of their working hours wearing a mask, where most people only wear one at most two or three hours a day. If you must be exposed to pathogens for your immune system to work, why do you wash your hands? It is true that coronavirus has a very low fatality rate, but it is still a problem. If only 1% of people who get it die, but 10 million people get it, that is still 10,000 people dead, which is a huge problem. Not to mention the many many people who get severe symptoms, such as lung scarring.</p>

        <p>Different masks do different things. Surgical masks reduce droplet emissions, during surgery. They don't interact with what you breathe at all. Surgical masks for the reduction of transmission by aerosolized particles would be a joke. They're not what is being discussed by those who actually consider them for a disease intervention.</p>

        <p>You're welcome to if you want to spend your time, money, and effort that way, but no, since they don't impact the spread of the disease, laws requiring them should not be in place. With its predecessor (you know, sars-cov-1) Australia started fining companies for claiming surgical masks helped protect you!</p>

        <p>The masks don’t actually weaken your immune system. Buddy over here just watches too much conspiracy bs 🤣 but I bet he’s never taken a real health or basic anatomy class much less has been in any anatomy or science classes for college but since some tinfoil hatter on YouTube or bittube (the bs YouTube cause yt isn’t taking their shit anymore and yeeted them off the platform) told you that, you’re all of a sudden a genius on how the human body works. Believe it or not, masks don’t weaken your immune system. Never have never will. Next bs argument.</p>

        <p>I am not against mask wearing, but if everyone is wearing a mask it creates a delussion that this virus is more serious than it is and then this has negative consequences as public opinion shifts and influences politicians, begging for lockdowns etc. and the consequences coming from that. I only wear my mask where required because of this. I don't want to walk around signalling to others that I am afraid, or accept mask wearing as normal behaviour.</p>

        <p>The legit answer is several 1) Masks don't work, they don't block a droplet that is smaller than a mask is capable of filtering... only an N95 mask blocks 95% of particles, 2) Virtue signaling and a sign of submission/identity, 3) the harms that come from extended mask usage such as breathing in the bacteria that one produces and exhales and then inhaling that causing serious oral issues to gums and also to lungs (bacterial pneumonia)</p>

        <p>1)Ok, so wear a N95 mask.</p>
<p>2)Who exactly gains from you showing your submission?</p>
<p>3)If masks are harmful, why have surgeons worn them for years? Also, couldn't most of the bacteria counteracted by having proper dental hygiene (brushing your teeth)? Even if masks caused an increase in bacterial pneumonia, antibiotics are extremely cheap and widely available, compared to coronavirus, which has no cure.</p>

        <p>1) Yes, the only exceptable mask if you needed protection from droplets is an N95 mask</p>
<p>2) Those more powerful than you and I that are in control of it gains from ones submission, if they can get you to wear a mask... guess they can get you to submit to anything for the sake of 'safety' </p>
<p>3) Surgeons do wear masks, yes you are right but wearing a mask with proper usage (clean hands, short-term usage) of medical masks in a medical environment is way different than your average person wearing it out in the real-world with unsanitary hands, improper storage and long-term use. Also, whoever told you that corona has no cure has you fooled... it does have a cure, it is just not marketed because why market a fix when you make more money off the cause</p>

        <p>1)Ok, so we agree on that.</p>
<p>2)I wouldn't submit to anything for the sake of safety. Most scientific organizations support wearing masks, so I do. If the government went against scientific organizations I wouldn't listen to the government.</p>
<p>3)No scientific organization is saying you shouldn't wash your hands. Hand washing is still an important technique for prevent spread of coronavirus. Also, surgeons spend most of their working hours performing surgery, wearing a mask, which I'm pretty sure is categorized as long-term use. I definitely spend way less time a day wearing a mask just going to the store. Drug companies are making more money, but that is nothing compared to the money governments would give them if they found a cure.</p>

<p>Yes, bacteria is dangerous and a real problem. They can be extremely deadly, especially when someone already has another disease. However, coronavirus has caused over 350k deaths, and bacterial infections due to mask-wearing have killed at most a couple thousand.</p>

        <p>We need to tattoo this number on your arm. It will help us track diseases and exposures. No risk to you at all, but we can make sure a sick person doesn't get on a plane and expose you to something potentially deadly. Trust us, we're experts.</p>
<p>If you don't understand that even masks have downsides, do some research. Childhood development requires seeing faces. Masks restrict airflow. Masks harbor disease in that nice moist, warm space. Masks are an environmental nightmare. Masks reduce human interaction, decrease the intimacy of every discussion. There are rumors that some people can't hear well, and use lip movement to help them understand you talk.</p>
<p>Even if masks worked, requiring them is insane.</p>

        <p>Problems such as developmental issues are a valid concern, however that won't become a large problem unless people wear masks for many years on end. Also, even if masks caused bacterial infections there are many antibiotics for those, as opposed to no cure for coronavirus.</p>

        <p>The development issues are everywhere from learning what faces are, to understanding emotion, to learning to talk, to learning how others react to our behaviors. You may not care if your kid is only set back by a few months or years, but good parents do. And yes, many states, including mine, require childcare of all ages to wear masks.</p>

        <p>Lets get past the part where we say they don't work, because they don't. The science behind it doesn't add up and for whatever transmission they do help with, I assure you the number is too small for us to even give a shit about.</p>
<p>The problem most of us have here is the out of control cult of science behind it as well as the social repercussions.</p>
<p>- I cannot see your face or read facial expressions. These are things that you go by when conversing, speaking to others. They are not negligible.</p>
<p>- Filthy. Either you're wearing the same mask over and over, or you're buying a new pack which aren't cheap every week (If you do keep using a new one per store), and if I hear ONE MORE MORON say "Bruh me use bandana! Me was hand reuse!". Yeah, a bandana is not a medical device. BANDANAS DON'T STOP VIRUSES. The same people that freak out in stores for others not wearing masks right are using those RIDICULOUS contraptions that go around your neck up and up to your mouth like this - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=neck+bandana+mask&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwip6--gyIDuAhWyp1kKHaK5AeMQ_AUoAnoECB4QBA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=970">Here</a> - It even says on the back "This is not approved by the FDA AND IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE". </p>
<p>- The social pressure. How many times are these freaks going to attack others for not wearing a mask in a store when they don't work? It's a way for these no lifes to take out their anger on someone not utilizing their life saving medical device the correct way. People don't want to deal with this anymore. Some of these mental cases even wear masks OUTSIDE now and those that don't get shit for it.</p>
<p>If they worked all of these points would be negligible. The biggest part though is that they are dehumanizing. I cannot read expressions, see you speak or react, even hear you well with the muffled piece of cloth, and we all sort of just become masked / faceless entities. It is dehumanizing. And no, I will not "Just suck it up" and rollover for a device that takes away what makes us human.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I trust the "cult of science" because it has given us things like antibiotics. If you don't trust the "cult of science" when it comes to masks, how come you still take antibiotics? </p>
<p>Yes masks make it harder to understand other people, but I'm sure that is worth saving lives over. </p>
<p>Ok. So don't use a bandana. </p>
<p>You have a right to not wear a mask the same way a store has the right to not let you in. So, you don't want to wear a mask because other people are telling you to. It seems like you just don't want to be told what to do.</p>

        <p>Wrong.  </p>
<p>If masks work, they slow the acquisition of herd immunity, lengthening the lockdowns and ENDING lives, as well as crippling the health and future of those who survive.  </p>
<p>If they don't work, you're legitimizing the worship of Fear, and telling the government and the world that you're perfectly okay with surrendering your rights in its name, thus setting the precedent for things that would be a hell of a lot worse.  </p>
<p>You're still free to wear one; no one here will stop you.  But some of us choose not to.  Is the minuscule risk really not worth the potential lives, and rights, and economic strength saved?</p>

        <p>Oouuuu my fav question. And I’m gonna get downvoted to hell for it buttttt here’s the real answer for most of the morons on this subreddit. “It takes away our rights” lol so a lot of people hate it simply cause it’s a VERY MILD inconvenience to their daily lives. These people will bitch about pretty much anything and I myself am no exception because bitching is fun let’s be real but when it’s been like 10 months coming up on 11, the “but my rights” argument is so full of shit. Your rights aren’t being infringed on for being told that masks help with the spread of covid butttttt no one understands that because “doctors aren’t actually smart” according to some loser on the internet. People don’t like wearing it so they’re gonna complain. There’s nothing actually bad about it. Especially rn with the colder months being here I’m kind of a fan cause my face gets really cold. Would I rather not wear one at all? Of course! We all would. But for rn we gotta wear them so we van go to the grocery store. Most people bitching about their rights on this sub have never actually had their rights violated. So I just sit and laugh.</p>
