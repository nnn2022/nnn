        <p>This reminds me of the (very poorly written) book I read as a kid called The Barcode Tattoo. I've been comparing it to the Vax since I heard about it but basically the tattoo is your credit card and I'd and medical insurance but what it actually is is microchips injected into you to weed out the undesirable population and basically the insurance companies decide if you get to be a person or not. Super fun stuff 😬</p>

<p>Revelation 13:16-17 NASB — And he causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, to be given a <em>mark</em> on their right hands or on their foreheads, and he decrees that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the <em>mark</em> , either the name of the beast or the number of his name.</p>

        <p>Predictive programming. We must remember our children are the top target for pushing more extreme measures of control. If the children are subject to it at a young age, they will not question what they have been told is normal later in life. Further forwarding the nwo agenda each generation. This has been going on for years, and is the reason we are where we are today. All of us have been, and still are exposed to predictive programming.</p>

        <p>Desensitization and predictive programming walk hand and hand. Many shows and movies show exactly what the bad guys are doing, which still falls in line with the programming being implemented. It's put in your face "as is" for a reason. A few examples I could use is star wars, and the avengers. Some people see the empire as evil or the bad guys, yet others agree with the empire. Another could be thanos. We've all see the " thanos did nothing wrong" even though his action are monstrous. It seems you are making the case that predictive programming always has to be presented in a positive light to work. I would disagree.</p>

        <p>Oh man here we go. Let's start making crazy personal assumptions. I've actually played Magic myself, along with other card, board, and video games that some people would consider evil or satanic. I'm a very open minded individual. Why is it that when people not unlike yourself can't bring good information, a healthy disagreement, or even your own opinion, which you have every right to have, to the conversation. Individuals not unlike yourself turn to personal assumptions, deflection, threats, and name calling, instead of enjoying a conversation with someone even if that person may disagree with you. Before you put words in my mouth I'm not accusing you personally of all of these.</p>

        <p>Think about what you’re saying about “predictive programming.” You’re saying any portrayal of the mark or other bad things at all is bad. Even if the entire point is that it’s bad, just showing it at all means it’s going to make people in the real world ok with it. So then we shouldn’t portray it in fiction in any way shape or form? And where does it end? Take that out and then you gotta take out the next-worse thing behind it. Then the next-worse thing, then the next-worse thing. If you stop at any point it becomes an arbitrary limit as all fiction is subjective. So in order to be logically consistent you gotta take all of it out in all fiction. Then we’re left with no fiction at all. We’d live in the world of The Invention of Lying. Or at best all fiction is Teletubbies baby-level drivel.</p>

        <p>I disagree with that portrayal of programing being so cut and dry, and that there isn't multiple factors or even levels to how predictive programming works, and how it receives the required outcome. I would make an assumption that there is probably multiple outcomes, which are at least based off the manner it is presented and the state of the viewers. A lot of projects like this, and others based on behavioral conditioning, and some as far as straight up brainwashing has its begings in government projects. We have been privy to the early stages of many projects such as the monarch project through whistle blowers or government information. However much is still unknown about the workings, and even the evolution of things.</p>

        <p>Tough question. I don't watch a lot of TV myself. Let alone enough to see what programs are available, though I will say they are called programs for a reason. However I can recall my own childhood, and even going back and rewatching so cartoon as an adult. I found a lot of the stuff was completely inappropriate and a lot of it extremely sexualized. To answer your question I would probably keep them away from television the best I could, but I know that can be easier said than done, but activities, and practicing skills seem to be healthy forms of entertainment.</p>

        <p>They are not called programs because they program people. They are programmed into the time slot. That’s why. The name stuck even after streaming.</p>
