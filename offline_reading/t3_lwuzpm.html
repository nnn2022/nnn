    <strong>The only way for this to end.</strong>
    <p><p>The only way for this to end is that this gets acknowledge for what it is: a a lie, a scam or a mistake. </p>
<p>Covid does exist, is the cold and the flu that always has been around, just that now has other name and it's sold as much more dangerous (that's what my common sense tells me). </p>
<p>By believing or giving space to the idea that there's this new virus around even if you think is overblown you are giving space to the possibility that the new virus can mutate into more dangerous strains and this can literally push this situation forever and eventually lead to getting at least 2 shots a year and keep the tests, social distance, masks and lockdowns forever. </p>
<p>Even if things go back to normal, like right now in Texas etc which I'm hoping that will happen to other places soon, either anytime or specially during winter when the flu season will start again. They can always say that the virus mutated and bring restrictions back. </p>
<p>Be honest with yourself, if you wouldn't have heard that there's a new virus in the media and by your government you would have never seen it around you, besides masks and lockdowns nothing has changed. People get sick every year and people die.</p></p>

        <p>As a scientist, I can assure you that Covid-19 is not an Influenza-Virus and therefore not the same thing as the flu. If you one day get to visit a lab (maybe you have some friend who could take you there), you could actually see the differences between Sars-CoV-2 and the cold/flu with your own eyes.</p>

        <p>I‘ll try to give an explanation to your question. Also please excuse any mistakes, English is not my first language. Let‘s maybe start with the cold: The cold is not actually just one virus. It can get caused by many different viruses, such as rhinovirus (around 40% of colds), RS-virus (10-15%) but also different forms of corona virus (around 10% of colds). These forms of corona virus are not the same as Sars-CoV-2, but it is the reason why some people do have some sort of cross-immunity against Sars-CoV-2 without ever having had contact with Sars-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Influenza, which causes the flu, is an entirely different virus. While it does have some similarities to Sars-Cov-2 (such as both impacting the respiratory system or both being spread via aerosole as well as smear-infection), they do have some big differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Covid-19 attacks many more different organs. Consequently, long-term damage occurs more often in the case of Covid-19. Furthermore, the mortality of Covid-19 is higher than that of the flu.</li>
<li>⁠Corona virus has a much longer incubation period: 2-14 days as compared to 1-2 days with Influenza. This means that people can carry the virus and infect others for a longer period of time than in case of Influenza.</li>
<li>⁠The symptoms are generally pretty similar. The biggest giveaway is loss of smell and taste, which doesn‘t occur with Influenza</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, the reason why Covid-19 is more serious than the flu is for those 3 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠We didn‘t use to have a lot of immunity against it, because Sars-Cov-2 was new, while Influenza was not</li>
<li>⁠It spreads more easily, because people spread it for a longer period of time without feeling sick</li>
<li>⁠Long-term damage occurs more frequently and the mortality is higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason why there were such few flu-cases is because the flu transmits in the same way as Covid: Both by aerosole and smear-infection. This means that the measures against Covid also help reduce influenza numbers. The reason why they are close to 0 in some places while Covid is not is because of the longer incubation period of Covid, as explained above.</p>
<p>The reason I occasionally post in this group is because I see a lot of misinformation being spread. My hope is that some people in here are still receptive towards scientific facts and are willing to engage in a discussion or ask questions. After all, critical thinking also means listening to the other side, which is why I hope some people might actually consider my opinion.</p>

        <p>&rt;I‘ll try to give an explanation to your question. Also please excuse any mistakes, English is not my first language.</p>
<p>I appreciate the effort, English is not my first language either. And your English much better than good enough.</p>
<p>&rt;1. ⁠Covid-19 attacks many more different organs. Consequently, long-term damage occurs more often in the case of Covid-19. Furthermore, the mortality of Covid-19 is higher than that of the flu.</p>
<p>Many more different different organs? Would you mind to expand?</p>
<p>Some quick search in Google before 2020 talking about possible complications of  influenza:</p>
<p>They include viral or bacterial pneumonia, dehydration, and ear infections and sinus infections, especially in children. The flu can worsen long-term medical conditions, like congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.</p>
<p>You might also have muscle inflammation (myositis), problems with your central nervous system, and heart problems such as heart attacks, inflammation of the organ (myocarditis), and inflammation of the sac around it (pericarditis).</p>
<p>Source: https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/flu-complications</p>
<p>About the mortality rate could you also be more specific?</p>
<p>&rt;2. ⁠Corona virus has a much longer incubation period: 2-14 days as compared to 1-2 days with Influenza. This means that people can carry the virus and infect others for a longer period of time than in case of Influenza.</p>
<p>I give you the benefit of the doubt. However have in mind that for travelling to most places you need a PCR a test negative within 48 hours before departure, the logic behind shows that they are scared that you can spread the virus not longer than 48 hours just as the flu. </p>
<p>&rt;3. ⁠The symptoms are generally pretty similar. The biggest giveaway is loss of smell and taste, which doesn‘t occur with Influenza</p>
<p>"The flu can damage your sense of smell. Fortunately, this is usually not permanent, though it may take it a while to return. Often, whether or not you regain your sense of smell depends upon the underlying cause. If extensive damage is done to your nasal nerves, it is more likely that the condition will be permanent." </p>
<p>Source: https://www.raleighcapitolent.com/blog/lost-sense-of-smell?entryid=109&amp;tabid=89</p>
<p>"Any type of infection of the upper respiratory tract can affect sense of taste. That includes the common cold and influenza, which can cause nasal congestion, coughing, and sneezing. The flu can also cause fever."</p>
<p>Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-get-your-taste-buds-back#treatments</p>
<p>&rt;The reason why there were such few flu-cases is because the flu transmits in the same way as Covid: Both by aerosole and smear-infection. This means that the measures against Covid also help reduce influenza numbers. The reason why they are close to 0 in some places while Covid is not is because of the longer incubation period of Covid, as explained above.</p>
<p>There are places such as Sweden, Texas, Florida that either didn't have lockdowns and masks or had much lighter restrictions and still the flu either disappeared or it went dramatically lower. </p>
<p>&rt;The reason I occasionally post in this group is because I see a lot of misinformation being spread.</p>
<p>As I sourced you all mainstream articles they differ with the information you're spreading. </p>
<p>&rt;My hope is that some people in here are still receptive towards scientific facts and are willing to engage in a discussion or ask questions.</p>
<p>I am receptive about scientific facts when they are irrefutable such like the scientific method applied. The question is that if you're receptive and open to change your mind when presented with the evidence and common sense, like I'm doing right now. </p>
<p>&rt;After all, critical thinking also means listening to the other side, which is why I hope some people might actually consider my opinion.</p>
<p>I consider everyone's opinion and then I make up my mind.</p>
<p>I don't want to come as offensive but really you seem to be very uninformed and unless you still have points to make, you didn't change my mind not even one bit. The fact that you're a scientist in this case make me lose faith in scientists. I don't understand how someone like me who is just someone who uses common sense can be more articulated  and informed than you. </p>
<p>I invite you anytime to do a video call debate to be posted in this group, we might learn something from eachother.</p>

        <p>as a scientist you might be able to answer this once and for all:</p>
<p>has the covid19 virus been fully sequenced?
not just parts of it and someone added the rest of the sequence that looks like it could match? </p>
<p>has it been isolated?</p>
<p>or in other words: is there solid proof there is a covid virus and it is not just a misinterpreted exosome?</p>
<p>just curious. these are talking points by actual covid deniers</p>
<p>looking forward to see some solid facts</p>

        <p>First of all, one small detail: Sars-Cov-2 is the virus causing the disease Covid-19 (which stands for coronavirus disease 2019), so your term „covid19 virus“ is a bit inaccurate, as the „v“ in covid already stands for virus. Just a detail, obviously everyone is going to understand what you mean, so it‘s not that important. </p>
<p>The virus has first been isolated on January 7 2020 and many times after, so the claim that there is no proof for the existence of Covid-19 is false.</p>
<p>Then again, I generally highly advise against using Reddit as your source of information and facts. People are going to make all sort of claims on the internet (this subreddit is a good example, a lot of the information on here is false), and you cannot really trust what anyone is saying because the internet is anonymous and people can spread all sorts of stuff online. So please never forget to do research on your own. I know finding credible sources can be hard, so you should look out for people who have a lot of expertise in their fields (with Covid this would be Virologists, Immunologists and Epidemiologists). Again, not all of them are going to agree on absolutely everything, as in many subjects there‘s still scientific discourse.</p>

        <p>Ok but as a scientist you should know the difference between "genomic sequencing" and "isolating" as they are different things. The person above asked if the virus has been sequenced fully so if the full genomic sequence has been found but your answer to that was the virus was isolated in Jan 20. But it wasn't.</p>

        <p>my question wasnt really answered</p>
<p>sure, saying covid19 in this context is wrong, my mistake</p>
<p>and relying on people on reddit for infos is not the best idea</p>
<p>but i expected more of an answer, maybe links to studies (etc etc) about "it has been isolated on jan 7", which could be just another unfounded claim, how can i know?</p>
