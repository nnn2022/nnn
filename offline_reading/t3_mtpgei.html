        <p>Everyone everywhere keep doing this. </p>
<p>Fuck this lie. </p>
<p>Covid is a cold. </p>
<p>If you're unhealthy, cold becomes worse and will adversely affect your health. Symptoms will accelerate co-morbidities. This has been how reality and viruses have worked since.the beginning of time. Nobody was afraid of the cold before but because it's become politicized and propagandized 24/7 for a year so the hegemony can gain total control, the populace has fallen in line like blind sheep.</p>
<p>Notice how nobody died of flu last year? That doesn't seem suspicious? Also, death tolls have remained consistent to population year after year, so this is literally nothing. Please be humble and realize you've been hoodwinked.</p>
<p>I go out proudly every day not wearing a mask. I wasn't afraid of catching a cold my entire life, and if I do, I'll get over it. And it shifts every year, like it does. This has literally been the reality for my entire life. It has been yours, as well.</p>
<p>Maybe people are so egocentric they can't admit they were wrong. The government certainly is.</p>

        <p>I thought there were more deaths in the US last year than expected. I believe the excess number was around 350-500,000 which is inline with covid “death” numbers. </p>
<p>Now whether we handled Covid correctly is another question. We probably could have saved more lives through herd immunity and focused protection of the elderly and at risk.</p>

        <p>Nope. 2020 saw a 1.2% increase in total deaths.</p>
<p>Same increase as every year back to 2006.</p>
<p>There were in no way 500K extra deaths from the Wuhan Flu.</p>
<p>50K possibly, and even that is probably too high an estimate.</p>

        <p>I mean, everyone working from home = less traffic = less traffic deaths too. In my country this year was the first year where we saw a significant drop in deaths by cars, but I'm not sure how that holds up for america?</p>

        <p>We actually had more traffic deaths, oddly enough. Cops were told to not pull over people for speeding, so lots of people started driving like psychos and some extra got in deadly accidents because of it.</p>

        <p>It's purely anecdotal, but the March before last some buddies of mine who we're able to keep working (plumbers, electricians, ect) were bragging about they and other repairmen were flying from job to job at 100+ mph because there were fewer cars on the road and they knew no one would pull them over. I'm sure it varies by locale, but I can't imagine that reckless behavior like that didn't contribute to the increase in fatal accidents.</p>

        <p>I drove 20k miles in 2020 between Colorado Washington and Montana </p>
<p>The highways were brutal. We had some gnarly winter storms though which made things worse</p>
<p>I can confirm from first lockdown in March to about May there were zero speed traps</p>

        <p>I don't think this is true but am interested in data that suggests otherwise. </p>
<p>Total Resident Deaths 2017-2020</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db328.htm#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20a%20total%20of,at%20birth%20decreased%200.1%20year.">2017: 2,813,503</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">2018:2,839,205</a></p>
<p>And increase of 25,703 from 2017</p>
<p>[2019: 2,854,838] (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm)</p>
<p>An increase of 15,633 from 2018</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm">2020: 3,358,814</a> with 377,883 attributed to Covid. </p>
<p>An increase of 503,976 from 2019</p>
<p>I don't think the number of deaths is easy to fake/manipulate. So while we know that deaths directly attributed to covid may not be entirely accurate, I believe its fair to say that more people died in 2020 than in 2019. </p>
<p>Interestingly the rate of death per 100,000 residents may be lower between 2020 and 2019... which at first glance doesn't make sense unless there was a massive increase in population</p>

        <p>Yeah I mean, not trying to stir anything up but I’d love to see a source on this. It’s either 1. The truth, 2. A shitty report with poor data 3. A boldfaced lie. </p>
<p>I see your belief is that 50k seems high but come on now that just seems exceptionally contrived.</p>

        <p>Texas and Michigan have similar vaccination rates right now (Michigan is actually higher), and yet the difference is stark. In a place like Texas, where restrictions were looser and people were able to get the disease, get better and gain natural immunity, we're seeing NO negative impact from opening up. In places like Michigan, where lockdowns measures were harsh, natural immunity is basically non-existent, and thus they're STILL having cases rise. If I were you, I would be ashamed that I was unable to think critically about the situation.</p>

        <p>&rt; We probably could have saved more lives through herd immunity and focused protection of the elderly and at risk.</p>
<p>This is what I was saying from the get-go. Even before we had a clearly defined vulnerable group, we knew that covid targeted older people much more so than the young. Probably would've been a good idea, say, to not put covid positive people in a nursing home.</p>

        <p>Natural immunity appears to fade, supported by people who got it early getting it a second time.  There are also mutations, which, with a very contagious virus (high r value), is very likely.  We've seen many variants already.  With even a 2% death rate, the cost of herd immunity is massive, and with the fading immunity it's most likely not possible.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have shown the real problem is dunces like the ones in this shithole refusing to comply, and making it impossible to effectively stop the spread.</p>
<p>How have you not read even the most basic information to know what you said is so incredibly wrong?  The data and studies have been damn clear about it.</p>

        <p>It's a combination of both. There is always an increase in deaths every year, because our population has doubled since the 50s, and they need to die at some point. We also had many die from government and media pushed mass hysteria, both intentionally from shoving vents into people who didn't need it and intentionally putting sick people in nursing homes full of the only actually vulnerable population (although even then, it probably only lightly accelerated deaths. Strong healthy elderly with years left to live don't usually get dumped in nursing homes), and second order effects like suicides, overdoses, denied healthcare, and extreme stress. I'm honestly surprised it's not way higher.</p>

        <p>I think some were Boomers (my generation) but more were from the Silent generation. The oldest Boomer would be 75. Older than that is the Silent generation, like my parents who are in their 80's.</p>

        <p>The problem is sussing out what proportion of those excess deaths were unavoidable "Oh, shit, there's some new virus in the world and our aging populations are probably going to take a bit of a hit no matter what" deaths and what proportion were caused by the response itself: delayed medical care, people avoiding getting care when they should have, deaths of despair and anxiety, self-harm, etc.</p>

        <p>I'm not an expert but I assume it takes into account demographics and life expectancy. </p>
<p>The answer may lie in the sources below if you dig through them. But I don't think an aging population explains the massive increase in resident deaths this past year. It should be more of a gradual increase as that large demographic gets over 75. </p>
<p>Total Resident Deaths 2017-2020</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db328.htm#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20a%20total%20of,at%20birth%20decreased%200.1%20year.">2017: 2,813,503</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db355.htm">2018:2,839,205</a></p>
<p>And increase of 25,703 from 2017</p>
<p>[2019: 2,854,838] (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm)</p>
<p>An increase of 15,633 from 2018</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e1.htm">2020: 3,358,814</a> with 377,883 attributed to Covid. </p>
<p>An increase of 503,976 from 2019</p>
<p>I don't think the number of deaths is easy to fake/manipulate. So while we know that deaths directly attributed to covid may not be entirely accurate, I believe its fair to say that more people died in 2020 than in 2019. </p>
<p>Interestingly the rate of death per 100,000 residents may be lower between 2020 and 2019... which at first glance doesn't make sense unless there was a massive increase in population</p>

        <p>About a 1.2% increase. Same increase as every year since 2006.</p>
<p>The wuhan flu hardly made a measurable difference.</p>
<p>They are just counting tons of deaths from common causes as covid deaths.</p>
<p>It's totally dishonest, but very easy. US health authorities even fully admit it.</p>

        <p>The numbers went from \~2.8 million to \~3.2 million. But, I would bet money they are proportionally lower next year. I think COVID mostly killed people who were already about to die (one foot in the grave), co-morbidity speaking.</p>

<p>Even if all the 500k deaths were due to covid (they weren't, lockdown had far reaching effects and undoubtedly caused extra deaths), it's not worth shutting civilization down due to the effects that will have lasting probably for the rest of our lives and longer. Governments and corporations have gained enormous amounts of power and money due to all this, and small businesses have shut left, right, and center.</p>

        <p>Where at in kentucky? Here in Louisville, it seems like anytime I take it off for a brief moment, for example, trying on a shirt some manager gets aggressive and tells me to put it on, being aware of my distance(not that it matters) I usually say hold up but they get on my ass even more thus I just put the damn thing on till they leave. Fuck Louisville at this point.</p>

        <p>Wha? Is this the upside down? Science is definitely in favor of masks. Also you said cult not me 😂</p>
<p>On that note... arguing with a brick wall is very fun and all, but I’ve got a slug that needs help understanding that salt is bad for him. He keeps saying that the paper I placed over the salt he was crawling on was worthless. Something about freedoms? Anyway, long day ahead of me!</p>

        <p>Your stupidity is amazing, studys where the conclusion is "might be" and "may be" are not proof where as the Stanford study amongst others appear far more conclusive that masks do not prevent viral transmission. No one is going to stop you from wearing a mask if you want to but don't try and force your delusion on others.. Unless you wanna do it in person although I doubt you would have the balls for that as you come across as another if those pathetic weasel types</p>

        <p>Just checking in on ya bud. I see you’re out there fighting the good fight. I think we got off on the wrong foot; I’m sure we have more in common than not. Going to “tough guy” when your argument has run aground isn’t a great look. Insults and threats indicate you’re out of ammo, not that it was hard hitting artillery before that, lol. “I’ve found videos that support my opinion and now I’m yelling, so that makes me right!!” 
Get some air. Read a book, maybe 10. Drink a glass of water or something, shit. 
oh, I’m also 6’4” 210, so a REALLY BIG weasel, I guess 😂</p>

        <p>Do do you go up to people and tell them to wear a mask? My point is if  you support mask mandates then go enforce it your self
And yes if you support the theft of our rights then you are indeed a big weasel
No one is telling you what to do so what makes you think you can tell others what to do.
Unless you don't support vaccine Id and lockdowns in which case I'm lost as to the point you were making..</p>

        <p>Sooo you step on a stores rights for... What reason exactly? Why be a complete shit bag to the employees that have to deal with this stuff? Your rights aren't being infringed, you're infringing others rights. </p>
<p>You don't have to go to a store that requires masks. THAT is your right. You can also walk around in public without a mask, that is your right. You can't break stores rules, which they have the right to have and enforce. That just makes you trash.</p>

        <p>Perhaps in your little corner of the world you have been able to operate without lockdowns and just masks in shops. You need to look into what is happening in other places. All across the western world civil liberties are being trampled on, all in the name of covid prevention. Australia and Canada in particular are two countries that have seen significant increases in heavy handed policing but this stuff is going on all across Europe to. (There is a video doing the rounds of a Canadian policeman punching an old man in the face - the policeman was knelt on top of the man when he did it. This shit could not have happened two years ago)</p>

        <p>You do realise that you do not have the resources made available to doctors/ researchers/ scientists to make an informed decision on something that's way out of your job scope or field of study right ? no offence. that's  near exactly same for me. your "own sense" doesn't count at all unless you have proper things to back it up with. which in this case is likely none. </p>
<p>I wouldn't say contradiction. they made updates based on newly avail information. </p>
<p>warned from ? the people where I'm from are handling it well, unlike USA. at least things seems to be better now that biden is taking over.</p>

        <p>why do people keep thinking i live in the states, nope i don't, but i'll enjoy seeing you writhe under the current administration. to know that they have the legal means to put you jail, metaphorical vasectomy if you will. LOL. you'd think you're a brave wolf and all, but you're just a sheep in their eyes, and YOUR covid passport will come, and then you'd have to bend over hard for the new rules. LMAO</p>

        <p>in that case you'd bend over doubly hard and writhe even worse. if it were me i'd just leave it uncorrected. i've no idea why you're making this harder for yourself, i'd think that biden is better.   </p>

        <p>Yes, every single grocery store I've tried in northern NJ has mask bouncers at the entrance and will track you down in the store and kick you out if you aren't wearing.</p>

        <p>I never wear a mask, and a few months ago I was standing in the tram when some old woman approached me and screamed that I should wear a mask to protect her. I said no and told her to go away but if shes so scared. She then saw that someone from the tram company was sitting next to me and wanted him to throw me out. He didnt say anything.</p>

        <p>Yup. total litmus test to gauge our obedience. And now all of these retail stores online are offering masks, along with their clothing items. It is becoming simply a "normal" part of life and that cannot be allowed to happen.</p>

        <p>I already do breath fresh air. I only wear a mask in stores. Life is preeeetty much normal here. During a pandemic, even if it is overblown, stores definitely have the right to require masks. They can set rules just as you can set rules at your house. Want guests to not wear shoes indoors? You're free to require that.</p>
<p>The stress serves no function other than making some moron feel good about harassing people. There are no rights to obtain. You are not fighting for a legitimate cause.</p>

        <p>Cold food is a legitimate complaint. It's more like you're complaining because a cold sandwich shop gave you a cold sandwich. It's their rules. It's how they are running their business.</p>

        <p>I know there is a group of people who get off from wearing the masks and forcing others to wear them, but I have to believe that most people are just going along to get along and are not ideological about it.  If that's the case, as this sham fades away and the ideologues lose their power, fewer and fewer people will be inclined to keep wearing them.</p>

        <p>agreed... Corporations only make their employees mask now so they don't run the risk of losing a nickle.  As soon as people start walking out of stores that require their employees and customers to wear masks this shit will go away fairly quickly.  BUT we have to tell corporate that en masse.</p>

        <p>I agree mostly  if it were up to the business itself I would def never shop at one that mandated them but here in NY the business will get fined by the state/city if they allow customers to not wear masks so they are being forced into it even if they don’t agree with it</p>

        <p>The difference is so insignificant it's not even worth the effort. You'd be better off telling people to wash their hands and avoid touching their faces, you know, like what they did at the beginning of this bullshit. That'd be more effective because clearly the average person now feels 100% safe as long as they got the mask. Face touching is A-Okay as long as you wear your dirty unwashed piece of fabric that lives on your car's dashboard.</p>

        <p>Are u dumb. Almost nothing in life makes a major difference. What does make a difference is stacking up all those little differences and changes. Also u r supposed to wash ur mask after every use. If u don’t wash it that’s just ur fault, so don’t try and use that as a point to argue with</p>

        <p>You missed their point. Most people do not wash their mask on a regular basis. They recommend that you wash your hands in warm water for at least 20 seconds before putting on your mask or touching your face. Almost no one does this. They recommend that you do not touch your mask after it is in place unless you again wash your hands before touching. Reason being is if you got Rona on your hands then you are now compromised. Again almost no one does this. If you want to take off your mask you must again wash your hands, and again no one does this. If you actually think that masks are working when no one is even using them how they recommend then maybe it is you that is dumb.</p>

        <p>You don't need to fear confrontation because it doesn't need to turn into one.  First, almost nowhere will anyone actually say anything. Second, if they do just say "no thanks, I'm fine" and that usually ends it. If they truly insist (and i'm talking about employees now, screw some random shopper) just say "okay then I'll take my business elsewhere".</p>
<p>That's it. There's no need for confrontation. Honestly, if you're losing your cool over it, you're not doing anyone any favors. Kill 'em with kindness.</p>

        <p>A week or so ago the owner of the store I work at said I didn't have to pretend to wear a mask anymore. I never wore it right but the owners were satisfied as long as there was an attempt. They never asked me to enforce it on the customers. We just put a sign on the door. </p>
<p>When the customers realize I'm not wearing a mask they take off theirs too. Since I stopped wearing one I don't think a single customer has kept their mask on the entire time they were in the store. Only about half the people wore masks anyways though. Our city has a mask mandate in effect until July 30th... As of right now. It's changed multiple times.</p>

        <p>never wore a mask since this bullshit started and never will and i am shopping for food and stuff just fine.</p>
<p>never wearing one is certainly the right thing to do, but if you are to afraid to do that, then NOT wearing one, until they physically hinder you from shopping or sth. else is certainly better than blindly accepting it and expecting, that they won't let you shop and do things.</p>
<p>lots of employees already long understand, that this is a scam, so those won't even talk to you about this at all.</p>
<p>again you should completely stop wearing a slave muzzle if you want to stop this slavery system, but not wearing one, until confronted and them refusing to leave you leave you alone is better than walking into the shop with a slave muzzle to begin with, that is for sure.</p>
<p>remember, that this WON'T go away until we make it go away.</p>
<p>if you fear confrontation now, then don't worry, it will come when they ask for ze vaccine paperz! which obviously you won't have, because you are a partially sane person.</p>
<p>so might as well draw the line with the slave muzzles now.</p>

        <p>are you free to do what you want as long as you don't harm another being?</p>
<p>no! well then you are a slave.</p>
<p>open cages slave though,  where the prison is mostly in the mind, rather than physically there, but that changes now too, if it goes according to the pedo monsters from the kakistocracy.</p>
<p>this is a great video for you to start questioning how enslaved we are:</p>

        <p>Good luck with that. The school system is so fucked that they are pretty much teaching kids liberalistic views and ideologies, and they are eating it up. It’s honestly so sad. There are so many teachers that have Biden shit all over their room (which is not allowed at all) but I get harassed by students and some teachers for wearing a Trump mask. I was sent to the office one time to get a paper mask because “controversial masks aren’t allowed.” Our next generation is screwed.</p>

        <p>If you don't believe in this woke/progressive/leftism/whatever that they are teaching in public schools, then STOP SENDING YOUR KIDS TO THOSE PUBLIC SCHOOLS! The fact that so many conservatives, libertarians, and even centrists will sit around an bitch about the indoctrination going on in public schools and then still send their kids to public schools makes them part of the problem. What incentive do these teachers have NOT to indoctrinate your kids with this shit? "Oh no! The person I think is an evil bigot is whining but still leaving their kid with me for 8 hours a day! Whatever will I do?"</p>
<p>I get that it is hard, but fuck... You really can't find some way to restructure your life and finances to make sure your child gets educated in an adequate manner? It is your fucking child. Get a cheaper car, a place with cheaper rent/mortgage, get a costco membership, start a budget, apply for grants. If you truly care about your child, you will MAKE IT work and not just sit around and moan and complain while some public school teacher spends 8 hours a day teaching your kids values in complete opposition to your own.</p>
<p>The breaking point for me was immediately after election night in 2016, a teacher in my Facebook feed made post saying " This is so devastating. I am so ashamed of this nation right now. <strong>What am I going to tell my students tomorrow?</strong>" My first thought was "Well, you are a drama teacher, so you could just teach them drama and keep your politics to yourself" After that, my wife and I decided we would do everything in our power to keep our kids out of public schools. Home school or private school. If cost is an issue, we'll move to a state with robust school choice programs, get a second job, cut back on luxuries, go hard on the budget, dip into 401k. Whatever we have to do for our kids, we will do it rather than sit around and bitch and send them anyway.</p>

        <p>I can see your point, and I can kinda agree to you on a certain level. Instead of moving me to a private school or homeschooling me, I was sent to public school anyway. I would learn politics with my parents and let the school teach me everything else. If the school tried to teach any politics, right or left wing, I would simply report it to the administrators and move on with my day. I was taught to not bitch about stuff too much and to just suck it up. I’m not really the type to be easily offended or have my feelings hurt, so it really wasn’t too much of a problem for me.</p>
<p>If anything, being in public school taught me that while people have opposing opinions on political topics and will try to implement them in anything, so be confident in your opinions no matter how alienated and horrible anybody tries to make them seem. As long as you discipline your kids and make sure that they aren’t butt-hurt about everything and anything, public school can actually be beneficial in a way.</p>

        <p>I love your passion but I think there are a few issues here. Sending your kids to private schools won’t deincentivise these radical left wing “teachers” from brainwashing kids. If anything the echo chamber will only get worse. I think conservative and non insane parents need to start standing up to these bullies and their unions. We can’t be scared anymore, we shouldn’t have to be bullied into running from them. I think there are a lot of people who have kids at these schools who look around and think what the hell is going on... but they don’t say anything because they believe they’re in the minority. Just my two cents and I don’t have children yet so maybe I’m off target</p>

        <p>I have considered this, and would agree to some extent, but am ultimately dissuaded for a few reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Change like this is not immediate or instant. It will take time. Time that your kid is still sitting in these schools being inundated with this garbage. I am willing to fight against something I see as wrong, but if any other option is available, I am not willing to subject my kid to that wrong while I do so. When possible, you pull your child away from danger before you confront the danger and put yourself between your kid and the danger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The echo chamber will not get any better by having my kid there. It isn't like I can sit in a classroom and confront a teacher's biases or indoctrinations as they are going on. Nor can I do anything about what the other kids in the class are hearing. My kids can't do anything to confront either due to the power dynamic. Teacher runs the class, kids shut up and listen. If they speak out too much, they get removed for being a disruption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 2020, it is hard to say how much any kind of speaking out will have any effect. There are school zones where parents of both right and left are vehemently demanding that schools reopen and the teachers and their unions are simply refusing. The CDC, WHO, Fauci, etc have all said that schools can safely reopen and schools are still refusing to open. It took a string of child suicides for Vegas to reopen their schools. LA and San Francisco school systems have also seen a rise in suicides and still refuse to open. If they won't budge in the face of their student literally killing themselves, they likely won't budge because of some bitching from conservative parents that they have already determined are evil misogynist racists anyway.</p>

        <p>Californian here, I spent the weekend doing various activities and most of the time only workers in places were wearing masks. All of the people I was around were tired of it all, and I'm sure the workers would have ditched them if they didn't have to worry about repercussions. I won't say what area I was in because I don't want dear leader' cronies to read this and send goon squads to shut things down, but it was a very back to normal experience.</p>

        <p>Kentucky voted to get rid of our mask mandate, and our governor vetoed it.  Unmasking is going to be a perk for everyone getting vaccinated.  The unvaccinated will be seen as outcasts.</p>

        <p>Minnesota is still Branch Covidian central. Twice in the past 48 hours, had two employees confront me or someone with me for not wearing a mask. I'll laugh while watching this state burn in a few days.</p>

        <p>That's horrible, and I've heard all about Tim Walz. It's such a shame what he's doing to such a beautiful state. I've even thought of moving to Minnesota in the past (before all of this crap, obviously.) I've been a few times and the woods and lakes in the north are amazing. It makes me so sad to hear about what's happening in the state.</p>

        <p>Been doing it for a month.  Only reason I wore one this long is I expected employees to care enough to say something, but they don't.  It's been nice not wearing one at all for weeks at a time.</p>
<p>The only time someone has commented on me not wearing a mask was on reddit.</p>

        <p>Went to a batting cage for a kid's birthday today. A couple parents started with no masks on and we never muzzle our kids anyway. Then it became obvious the one employee there didn't care and eventually the entire party (30 or so of us) was unmasked enjoying life like normal. Even the employee moved his gaiter to his neck. So refreshing to have normalcy again.</p>

        <p>Al it takes is a few people, and suddenly it’s no longer fringe, then the next and then the next, people will follow. All this mask bs just needs a few brave people to be casual about not wearing them and suddenly everyone will.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’ll wear one into a business if that business wants their customers to, that’s their decision to make as a business. If I don’t like I won’t go in. The shit that pisses off is when people are approached by random Karens in public. Like get the fuck away from people? If your concern is genuinely getting sick than why would you approach someone who is unmasked?? Everyone at my work is fully vaccinated and yet still pull their masks up if we’re talking in a “smaller space.” I refuse to and no one has said anything to me. What was even the point of getting the vaccine if you’re still gonna pull your mask up like everyone that approaches you is a fucking leper???</p>

        <p>I recently visited McD, and when walking out, security was barring entrance to a girl that forgot to take a mask from home. So while you can get away with it at some places, apparently not everywhere. Then again, Dutch people are sheep.</p>

        <p>Not wear one? I've never wore one!<br>
Seriously people are just human - they too do not wish to wear nor enforce said mandates/job requirements. But like most of us they too have rent and/or a mortgage to repay.<br>
Mass civil disobedience may be what's required for the rest of us to know we're not alone. Then it becomes easier to reject said mandate.</p>

        <p>I walked around the grocery store with no mask on. Even got to bring my puppy inside. No one said anything to me. Although, some people told me my puppy was cute! (It is not uncommon for people to bring their small dogs inside stores in my town. They have to be held, though. Unless they're seeing eye dogs.)</p>

        <p>Lifelong Michigander here. Before this “pandemic” I would have said you are dead wrong. But since the start of this, and moving from the west side to the east side, I’m beginning to want the f out of here. We still have the natural beauty going for us, and that’s one of the main reasons I loved this state. I will say it’s a lot better if you get out of the more blue counties.</p>

        <p>I’m currently stuck just south of Detroit for work. The regulations here suck, although I quit wearing a mask inside the gas stations and restaurants (gas station is basically empty and mask rules in restaurants are idiotic) </p>
<p>But my issues/ complaints don’t stop there. I’ve been to many areas of the country and this area in Michigan takes the cake for worst experiences by far at least in human interaction. Every single restaurant I’ve been to the CS has been atrocious the general consensus seems to be laziness paired with a false sense of self righteousness; From Texas Roadhouse ignoring my party to my hairstylist not uttering a single word to me as she cuts my hair in a style I, nor anyone on the face of the earth has ever asked for. To the high taxes and inability to invest in cryptocurrency to the drinking water and roads of people honking at me for no reason, the bars closing at 10-11 pm, dance clubs not allowing dancing, etc. this part of Michigan is not the place to be lol. I feel bad for the people to live here tbh. I’m not sure if the lackluster service is a result of the covid regulations or just something thats always existed here but it really makes me want to never visit this place, ever. Some places I’ve visited for work id love to go back to (Virginia, Wyoming, Montana for example) but there is no reason at all for me to come back up here on my own accord. </p>
<p>I’ve been told I’m in a shitty area of Mi, and I believe it lol, I just hope for the sake of Michiganders that the UP and the  western part of the state are better. So far if I want to have a good time I have to go down to Ohio lol.</p>

        <p>I've seen people say that if a business wants it's customers to wear a mask then it's their right.  But remember, "the customer is always right" means that if your customers don't want to wear masks, you don't make them wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Wish this was the case in Canada. Now that this "third variant" is being spewed around, businesses are literally refusing service to customers who don't wear one. I recently went on a road trip across the country and each province was worse than the other with masks. Hell, I got confronted in a small redneck town in Manitoba by a group of people and even the store clerk over not wearing one. This was in small town rural area! Blows my mind.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen two unmasked people in stores in the last 6 months or so. It hardly ever happens in my area of the twin cuties. I always wear a gaiter and pull it down while I’m checking out. I guess I haven’t had enough courage to go completely maskless and deal with the comments/anger from others.</p>

        <p>Depends where you are. I usually am fine not wearing one in my town of under 10,000 (never wear it anywhere, grocery store, gym, etc) or when I’m further north or west, but I usually get asked to wear one in the cities or big suburbs.</p>

        <p>I’ve been in one grocery store where the PA had a repeated message that said the usual covid guidelines, but it also said “be respectful of people with exemptions” I was very surprised to hear this. The small victories</p>

        <p>Isn't it sad that having a bare face just to run errands is now something you have to "get away with?" When people started wearing them of their own accord, that was crazy enough. I mean, it's not like the local Walmart is some uber-dangerous place, and the muzzles are treating it like just going out in public is a threat, of course, I knew they already thought that. But forcing it on people? That's a criminal level of ridiculousness.</p>
<p>But anyway, seriously, don't be scared. Hopefully you'll inspire others to have more courage. I NEVER wear one and I never will, and yes, I get harassed at times (but I live in a more muzzle-crazy place. Nothing like California, but still.) But I've never been thrown out because confidence is really important. It's about how you carry yourself. Don't act like you're doing anything wrong, because you're not. Just act like normal, but not afraid. Have resolve. For lack of a better way to say this, if you come off like you have your life together a lot better than them, they will be less likely to want to confront you over it.</p>
<p>If they do, there are a number of things to try. My go-to is just flat out ignoring them. Treat them like they don't exist, like you can't hear them. Make them talk to a wall. If they ask me if I have an exemption, I automatically say yes and nothing more. I've tried acting like I'm deaf, (I know ASL so I could back that up), acting like I don't speak English, (I speak Swedish which hardly anyone here even knows a word in, so that's pretty safe, too.), or you could make them feel bad for you. Now I'm getting into things that are more of a last resort. Say that you can't wear one, and were just thrown out of three stores. Start crying if you can. If they try pulling the "just order online" say you can't afford a phone or computer. If they say they'll shop for you tell them that's unacceptable because you're buying sensitive things. Or, just show them your rights. One of my favorite things to say (Assuming they've chased me through the store and haven't let me shop in peace) is "I'm in a big hurry, I have a husband/child at home that's recovering from surgery, and I don't have time to play dress-up/doctor."</p>
<p>Tell them how you're just trying to get the things you need in peace, and you'd like to be able to do that without harassment. Tell them that all you're doing is getting what you need and they're the ones accosting you. They're the ones on the offensive, here, after all. If all else fails, tell them you'd be happy to call a lawyer.</p>
<p>Also, I found a really cool guide to responses to give them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/mask-free-response-guide">https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/mask-free-response-guide</a></p>
<p>That website's got lots of other great stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, rant over, hope that helped.</p>

        <p>Today was the first confrontation I've had in months. Some busybody in Tesco started questioning means followed me in to the store saying I wasn't allowed in. I simply turned around, said I'm exempt and would appreciate it if he wouldn't harass me when I just want to buy some food.</p>
<p>That was a one off, I've been dozens upon dozens of times this year alone and absolutely no issues, in fact I usually get a smile and a good morning/evening on my way in. This one today must have been a new guy who wanted to make an impression.</p>

They fuck in their costumes too but people can't wear a small mask when they go into a market?   So when you don't wear a mask, other people think you are weaker than furries.

        <p>In Nashville it's a store-by-store basis. Walmart has "greeters" posted at the entrance that will chase you down through the store if you come in without one. However the regular employees don't seem to care. Most other corporate businesses will turn you away at the door without one, but the smaller places don't care.</p>

        <p>Did it in Michigan yesterday. Walked right by the greeter, they didn't say anything. Walked around, there were other people not wearing masks. At one point, an employee walked up to me. But they were walking over to see if I needed any help finding anything. It was nice.</p>

        <p>Do it! Go without a mask! Was at Meijers the other day and saw a guy, his wife and preteen daughter walking our way. We did not have masks on as usual and saw theirs in hand or hanging from one ear. As they got closer I gave them a big smile and when they noticed us their faces just lit up, the dad gave me a fist bump, and we had a quick acknowledgement that we are not playing along with this shit no more.</p>
<p>We went to other shops that day and they asked us to put them on, we always ask if we can shop without one, if not we put it on and under the chin. That is usually enough.</p>
<p>If you are afraid of confrontation just have you r mask and put it on if someone asks. If no one does, you just free breathed!</p>

        <p>Technically most places say CUSTOMERS need to wear a mask. If someone gives you shit, on a technicality you could just steal from the store (making you a thief not a customer) and that'll erase any mask violation. Hell, in some places, shoplifting less than $600 (IIRC) is now de facto "legal."</p>

<p>That's not just about Covid, it is <em>any</em> risk. You could get sick, you could get shot, you could get run over, you could be attacked by a wild animal, you could be abducted by extraterrestrials.</p>
<p>Everyone must assess the risk vs reward for themselves. To your rebuttal, you could reap the reward of being able to sustain yourself but that comes at the risk of the dangers of being outside. On the other hand, you could reap the reward of not putting yourself at risk when you go outst, but you may also starve to death.</p>
<p><em>Your</em> health and safety is <em>your</em> responsibility, not <em>mine</em>. You make choices that you feel comfortable with.</p>

        <p>The reason humanity has gotten as far as we have in the past 200,000 years, is because of civilisation. The base pillar of civilisation is that people do things that everyone benefits from, you are doing things that only benefit yourself. Even if at the end of this it turns out you were right, i will still defend my actions, because they showed at atleast a tiny bit of compassion.</p>

        <p>The answer is no. Virtue comes from someone making a choice to do something that benefits another. If government mandates I wear a mask, wearing the mask is no longer a virtue, therefore the idea of being compassionate is out the window.</p>
<p>Where I push back, is when the government comes in and tries to <em>make</em> people be "virtuous".</p>
<p>I'm not telling you to not wear the mask. I'm not telling anyone what to do. My original and unmoving opinion is: If you feel it's too dangerous to go out, then you should stay home.</p>
<p>That means you make decisions for yourself and I make decisions for myself. And tacit accusations of how horrible I am for not caring about other people cannot stand in the light of the bigger picture of weakening immune systems, psychological damage, financial and economic damage, and all around nastiness that these lockdowns and mandates have created.</p>

        <p>I mean, it's not that hard to find CDC data on this but I would imagine you would cope by claiming all data on Covid is fake so I'm fully aware this is likely not a legitimately curious inquiry</p>
<p>As an inverse, I suppose I would ask where you found data on a 0.01% death rate for covid, because that would be remarkable if so</p>

        <p>Instead of going through an editorialized proxy (using 8 month old data), I'll go straight to the mouth of the beast</p>
<p>https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days</p>
<p>This is of course taking into account that the major outbreak is already finished, the most at-risk communities basically got culled early/mid 2020, and we have a growing proportion of the US getting vaccinated</p>

        <p>How about don’t be so inconsistent. You can’t proclaim “My body my choice”  over the abortion issue, which is ACTUALLY killing a human, and then obsess over whether other people who aren’t even bothering you are wearing cloth on their face, which is hurting no one. You can’t have it both ways.</p>

        <p>That would be a discussion about when life starts. Is it at childbirth, at inpregnation, for some people semen would be considered life. You just can't wrap your brain about the fact that some things you do might actually affect others. "Which is hurting no one". 560k deaths but still in denial. </p>
<p>Absolute smoothbrain. This sub needs some nuanced people that can actually discuss a matter. Imagine living a life where you don't have to be scared of a pandemic and still try to be the victim.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it is a discussion. Not everyone agrees on the exact moment life begins. But if there is a CHANCE that it’s possible you are murdering a human that wanted to live, don’t you think that matters? Just like you think I should wear a useless and ineffective piece of cloth over my face because somebody might catch a cold. Somebody who is not a helpless baby, but a person who can stay at home or stay 6 feet away or get vaccinated  if they are seriously concerned about catching a flu that has a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>Btw, you realize that number for “COVID deaths” are actually just people who died WITH COVID, not people who died OF COVID? Not the same thing. Somebody who had COVID and died in a car wreck did not die OF COVID. </p>
<p>My point is, you can’t even be consistent. You just like to call people smooth brain because that’s the best argument you have.</p>

        <p>"Useless and ineffective" piece of cloth. Calling it a cold, then going back to a 99% survival rate?</p>
<p>Abortus must really hurt you personally, absolutely not hypocritical to point out how its murder but you're not willing to care about others cause they should just stay away from you. </p>
<p>Maybe one day we will figure out you were right and I was wrong, maybe covid ends up being a huge conspiracy,  it won't change the fact that you are an asshole that doesnt care about other humans, unless apparently its an unborn human (?).</p>

        <p>Apparently it’s still going strong where I am as well. Yet, I where a mask everywhere because I’m required too. How the fuck are cases through the roof if were still wearing them? Oh, because private social gatherings you say? I’ve been to and know many people who get together regularly. No one has gotten sick</p>

        <p>Yet there is a lot of people who have gotten sick so stop being selfish dicks and do the right thing. Wanna know something? We don't wear masks in my country cause we have all but eradicated it due to wearing masks and enforcing lockdowns. Sure it sucked at the time but its over now and we are free to go about our lives. Meanwhile it just keeps dragging on and on for some idiots.</p>
