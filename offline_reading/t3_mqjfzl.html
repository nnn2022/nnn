    <strong>Anyone have any sources on COVID spreading in schools / being hot spots?</strong>
    <p><p>Are schools super spreaders? I work in a school and there’s been no outbreak or cases (that I know of, besides people coming into contact with people who tested positive and had to isolate for a few days). I hear there’s a push to get school staff vaccinated (at least in Canada where I live) and I don’t feel comfortable getting the shot yet. Are schools even places that are considered hot spots?</p></p>

        <p>For some reason, all the doomers, teachers and the teachers unions seem to insist that they essentially can't ever go back to work. It's such a load of shit.</p>
<p>There's been zero proof that any outbreak ever originated in a school, children are the least likely demographic to be harmed by the virus, and least likely demographic to transmit this virus. The ones who worship "teh science", are awfully un-scientific in their approach to re-open schools. Schools most <em>certainly</em> aren't super-spreaders or hot spots.</p>
<p>Schools are and have been open around the world for months now. Everyone's fine. Schools need to be open right now. Teachers do not need the vaccine before the elderly, vulnerable or other "front-line workers", and kids should be the last vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I agree. I work with 7 year olds and they don’t have to wear masks at recess and they’re almost on top of each other (despite school rules and me trying to enforce them) and there hasn’t been a single case. Don’t get why people (doomers) are so scared? Hope they don’t end up pushing the vaccine within the next three months for school employees or I’m quitting.</p>
