    <strong>looking at it from their perspective</strong>
    <p><p>I'm starting to think that doomers actually 100% believe that masks protect them from the virus. i've been following r/covidpositive and theres some posts on there like "i know exactly when i got infected! i was in a store and 1 person wasn't wearing a mask!" I can see why they hate us SO MUCH since they really think that a shitty piece of cloth protects them, and us not wearing one is going to directly infect them. </p>
<p>What I don't understand is where they got this idea from. From the start nobody has ever said that masks were that effective. Cases are still going up in places that have mask mandates. If anybody believed that masks work, then why would they bother closing restaurants/gyms/etc ? So where did doomers get this idea that masks are their saviour? Is it just wishful thinking, or a way to blame other people (us) for getting infected?</p></p>

<p>Go into these grocery stores with the mask wearing dolts and they never adhere to any of the social distance guidelines anyways.

        <p>They are not able to detect gaslighting and conflicting information. Ie at the start even the media and governments said masks don't actually do anything, but then they later on mandated them. The majority then assumed the mandates were because they worked, but nothing had changed - masks still didn't work. Because they aren't able to face the fact that this is about control, they justify every restriction and mandate as being about safety, and assume all of it is to protect them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they do. I was arguing with a guy earlier who thinks that people who don't wear masks are bioterrorists and potential murderers. Some Doomers have at least started to acknowledge that they're not "magic," but they still say that they "help." I think they could help a little, but they could also help spread germs because of people touching them, so those two things might balance each other out.</p>

        <p>I think they might help too - especially surgical masks! But I just don't see them helping in the environment that theyre starting to be used as, which is wearing them everywhere. They weren't designed to be worn while walking around a store, or taking out of someone's pocket, or to be re-used. They were designed for hospitals and health care settings.</p>

        <p>They don’t help at all. You can compare states with mask mandates and states without, what you’ll find is their case counts were almost identical. They make no difference. They’re nothing but a constant reminder to each other that there’s a terrible killer virus on the loose. Without that mask their narrative falls apart immediately. It’s why they fight so hard to keep it going.</p>

        <p>People definitely believe they work and keep them safe. My Mom and I took a day trip to a gorgeous national park like normal people...meaning we don’t believe in the mask bs therefore we don’t wear them. Gorgeous windy day, we were walking along a trail and this couple was walking towards us. Fully masked, protective glasses, the whole 9 yards. They scurried off the trail into the rocks to get away from us as we casually walked past. Insanity. I wanted to say something out of frustration but decided to not be an asshole like the maskers tend to be.</p>
<p>And to be clear you read that right. I was with my mom (64 years old!!!!!) walking in the fresh air with no mask on!!! Hopefully we’re not both dead in a few days.</p>

        <p>You are correct most Doomers are convinced masks are effective. There are a few who are more on the fence, but think that even if there is a chance they will reduce infections, we should all wear masks anyways. </p>
<p>Where did this idea come from? You’ll have to ask Dr. Fauci. I think it’s mostly because we see people overseas wearing them all the time, and their infection and death rates seem to be lower. But it might not be the masks that are making the difference in those places. Our politicians also saw an opportunity to use masks as a scapegoat. Rather than telling people to socially distance all the time, just tell them masks work. </p>
<p>Thus the huge about-face by Tony Fauci, the CDC, Deborah Birx, and the surgeon general. This was all planned out for political reasons. It makes it seem like we are “doing something” about the pandemic. I suspect they are doing more harm than good, since old and at-risk people aren’t practicing social distancing anymore. </p>
<p>They are a great political tool also, because it’s a visual reminder to everyone that there is a pandemic going on. </p>
<p>Also whether they work or not is a nonfalsifiable claim. The burden of proof is on them to show they work. They havent been proven to reduce transmission of disease. The CDC only sites a few handpicked observational lab studies as “evidence” for their usefulness. </p>
<p>And of course, anyone who even questions the utility of masks are demonized for their wrongthink.  For a scientist, speaking out about the lack of evidence will get you ostracized for life.</p>

        <p>Forgive me for getting my always sunny on, but it’s the implication. </p>
<p>The media constantly ducks and dives from actual facts, siding with fear mongering and bullshit talking points where everyone acts like things are more effective than they are. Due to the fact most people don’t actually listen or follow anything up, these people are lead astray from fact and live in a world of pure hear-say hyped up nonsense. Of course they all echo each other because remember that’s all they are doing, repeating others. </p>
<p>There is a disease, but unfortunately it’s one of ignorance and over-assertiveness.</p>

        <p>I believe surgical masks do work in healthcare settings to a certain extent. Sometimes health care professionals will wear a surgical mask when caring for an open wound to avoid getting germs into a sterile area and causing an infection. It's the blanket mask wearing that I'm not sure about - like masks when walking around or just doing normal tasks.</p>
