    <strong>Vaccines and Selfishness</strong>
    <p><p>We're increasingly being told that if you don't get a Covid vaccine, thereby putting others at increased risk (whether this is actually true or not), then you are selfish.   And I've seen tons of posts trying to argue against this notion.  But let me suggest that we're making the wrong argument.</p>
<p>I actually agree that if you don't get a Covid vaccine then technically yes you are "selfish".  But see here's the thing.  We're all selfish.  That's life.  If you don't let random homeless people come live in your house because you prioritize your own peace and tranquility, then you are selfish.  If you ever spend money going out to dinner or on a vacation rather than giving every spare dollar you have to the needy, then you are selfish.  If you don't go out right this second and volunteer to donate one of your kidneys to some random person who needs it, then you are selfish.</p>
<p>"But Covid is a transmissible disease, blah blah blah".  Doesn't matter.  Death is death.  Doesn't matter if someone died from Covid or from cold exposure or from starvation.  In fact, far more people die each year worldwide from starvation than from Covid.  So again, if you EVER do something nice for yourself rather than using that money to fight hunger, then you are selfish.</p>
<p>So spare me the "but muh society" nonsense, while you sip your $7 Starbucks latte as some kid in the inner city a few blocks away from you starves.</p>
<p>We're all selfish.  Welcome to real life.  And you're not going to bully me into doing something I don't want to do, so that you can feel safer and go do the things that you want to do.  I care more about my teenaged kid's small chance of myocarditis from the vax than I do about your kid's small chance of getting hospitalized from Covid.  Sorry, not sorry.</p></p>

        <p>If you don't eat healthy and exercise you're even more selfish.  Your poor state of health is a burden on the healthcare system, and justifies increased costs for everyone.  Plus, becaise those who are so unhealthy, they have at least some level of preventable disability that they expect the rest of society to cater to and compensate for.</p>
<p>But if they get the vax, then magically they're saintly altruists.</p>

        <p>“You are selfish for not getting the vaccine.”</p>
<p>Scene safety is stressed a lot in EMT school. Let police secure the scene (if necessary) and then proceed. Although EMTs and all health and law enforcement professional are there to help others, they want to go home at the end of the night. Individual safety comes first. Yes, you have firefighters and EMTs or Cops who risk their lives saving someone yes, and that is heroic. However, in general, if the health care workers go down, who will help them? </p>
<p>A little study on terrorism in EMT school mentioned scene safety even more. Because a first attack like a shooting or bomb is to cause a lot of casualties. This draws medical response into the scene, and then the real attack goes off targeting those first responders crippling the system. </p>
<p>What I am saying is, you need to make sure you are safe. Watch out for your own skin. That isn’t selfish, that is responsible. I don’t know the long term effects, and do not feel safe without that knowledge so I won’t take it. I am healthy and can handle covid. This vaccine is too unknown for me right now. </p>
<p>The vaccine may be fine and dandy, I hope it is! But I need long term data on that. At the end of the day, if I get screwed by a jab, those same people won’t be there to take care of me, or my family, I am on my own. I have to look out for me first.</p>

        <p>If someone tries and calls me out as being selfish for not having a vaccine my immediate reply would be "and?".</p>
<p>With that said; if you wanted you could easily turn their logic against them.</p>
<p>Had everyone simply behaved how their doctors have been suggesting for the last century- eat well and have regular exercise of at least moderate exertion a few times a week, covid-19 wouldn't have even been sequenced and identified as most would have been healthy enough to fight it off with no more than a sniffle. If you aren't eating healthy and getting regular and frequent exercise, you're being selfish by threatening further lockdowns to protect unhealthy people like you, while having me pay for it through taxes.</p>
<p>There are other arguments to be made but that's the most cutting and effective imo.</p>
