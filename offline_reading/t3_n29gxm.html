        <p>They said it. Canada Health Department said it. Ireland Health said it. London said it. I’m sure more have said it as well but we just haven’t heard it yet. This is the one question I’ve been asking everyone. If they say they count everyone who dies with it regardless of cause, then why are you believing the numbers? And if you can’t believe the death numbers, why the hell would you believe the case numbers? It’s the most glaring, in your face lie and I can not get anyone to simply acknowledge that it exists.</p>

        <p>This has been publicly available information since last April 2020 pretty much anywhere.</p>
<p>When you factor in the 90 percent false positives it’s been clear that there is no pandemic, transparently obvious since last summer at the latest.</p>
<p>Too many people are cultists at this point. Now that it’s religious it doesn’t matter how obvious it is, they will do whatever high pope fauci and other “public health authorities” decree.</p>

        <p>"covid" and sars-cov2 are different. covid is just a list of symptoms that can be caused by the sars cov2 virus. the reason im saying this is because those "covid deaths" do not require a covid test. clinicians are/were allowed to put people down as a covid death without a positive test if they displayed covid symptoms: cough, sore throat, ball tickle. literally anything.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing a video <a href="https://week.com/2020/04/20/idph-director-explains-how-covid-deaths-are-classified/">from over a year ago</a>. They have since <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/05/12/illinois-is-not-inflating-coronavirus-deaths-in-fact-theyre-likely-higher-than-reported-officials-say/">updated their policy</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;For example, a death might be reported to the state and the death certificate might mention coronavirus — but when officials do a further review and see the person died from a shooting or car crash, they exclude that person from the state’s COVID-19 death toll, Ezike said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But if someone had another illness, like heart disease, and they suffered a stroke while battling coronavirus, it is not as easy to separate that and conclude COVID did not play a role in exacerbating an existing illness, Ezike said. That person would not be removed from the count.</p>

<p>Provide evidence that it is a "layer of lies" and maybe I will take you seriously. As of right now I will only see you as a paranoid citizen instead of a concerned citizen.

<p>That video of OP is the evidence, you moron xD What more evidence you need? You want them to dance the macarena or what?  </p>
<p>&rt; Science evolves  </p>
<p>This has nothing to do with science, but how you take note of the data. Someone positive with covid, that gets crushed by a truck and dies flat like a pancake, didn't die from covid. No need for science, to know that. Yet, that guy will be written as a covid victim. So, 0,025% of deaths per year, must be in reality less than half that. Prove me wrong.  </p>
<p>&rt; If you don't support that then you don't support the scientific method. </p>
<p>The scientific method to not get blood splatters in your mouth while doing surgery, is to put a mask on. The scientific method to not protect yourself from virus, is to put an hazmat suit .. :) What science do you believe, the one of the mainstream media, or the real science?</p>

        <p>Your only evidence that this is how deaths are counted is a year-old video of one person. You don't even consider the correction they made (which I linked) or the other health departments which have never counted deaths this way. It has to be a conspiracy for you, doesn't it?</p>

        <p>&rt;is a year-old video of one person</p>
<p>Wrong. I haven't seen that video. I'm not American. This has been done in Belgium also, where i live. And most likely in ALL countries. They even had to lower the number, as they blatantly added some deaths to the covid thing, without even having tested those ppl.<br>
Anyone that died in a senior residences or rest home, had been automatically put as covid victims, even when they were not infected. Some were just double counted. Here is one <a href="https://www.lecho.be/dossiers/coronavirus/le-covid-19-a-fait-moins-de-morts-qu-annonce-en-belgique/10247337.html">article</a> talking about this.<br>
In France, you flue related deaths suddenly are 90% less. From 20K a year, it went to 3K for 2020.<br>
So, this video is not just a 1yo video, but another one that adds among all the articles and video talking about similar problems.  </p>
<p>&rt; It has to be a conspiracy for you </p>
<p>Conspiracies are things done in the shades, where no one sees it. There is no conspiracy, here it's blatantly done in front of your face. Covid, doesn't mean pandemic, but economical reset and implementation of totalitarian rules. Are you blind, to not see it? Maybe you re too much on covid related articles, instead of economical. Inflation, wealth transfers, massive bankruptcies, real estate bubble, crypto's going to the moon, stock market going nuts, all the M1 and M2 money supplies from the big currencies skyrocketing ...<br>
History just repeats itself you know \^\^  </p>
<p>You re like that ignorant German from the 30's, that voted for Hitler, not realizing he was voting for his own destruction ... that's what you are. Some ppl warned back in the days. They were also frowned upon and called out...</p>

        <p>I work at a hospital. I've seen multiple people come in and die from trauma related incidents (car wrecks/falling off ladders/ head injuries) and their deaths ruled as covid because they tested positive for it. </p>
<p>Often times my department let's the mortuary guys in to pick up the body, in every instance like this they say something along the lines of "oh this is my 3rd covid body today".  When I know that the body theyre here to get died from physical trauma. I've seen it happen.</p>

<p><em>Historian, Antony Sutton writes:</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>American Medical Association</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”For the moment we want only to note that the impetus for reorganizing medical education in the United States came from John D. Rockefeller, but <strong>the funds were channeled through a single member of The Order.</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;Briefly, the story is this.  One day in 1912 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Taylor_Gates">Frederick T. Gates</a> of Rockefeller Foundation had lunch with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner">Abraham Flexner</a> of Carnegie Institution. </p>
<p>Said Gates to Flexner:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”What would you do if you had one million dollars with which to make a start in reorganizing medical education in the United States?"</strong></p>
<p>&rt;As reported by Fosdick, this is what happened:</p>
<p>&rt;”The bluntness was characteristic of Mr. Gates, but the question about the million dollars was hardly in accord with his usual indirect and cautious approach to the spending of money.  Flexner's reply, however, to the effect that any funds -- a million dollars or otherwise -- could most profitably be spent in <a href="https://rockfound.rockarch.org/public-health-at-johns-hopkins">developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School,</a> <strong>struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of Dr. William H. Welch, the dean of the institution."</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Welch was President of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1901, and a Trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1906.”</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">William H. Welch</a> was also a member of the Order and had been brought to Johns Hopkins University by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman">Daniel Coit Gilman.”</a></p>
<p>&rt;“The <strong>emphasis on drugs and experimentation</strong> which originated with the German allopathic school of medicine, and which was brought to this hemisphere by <strong>Illuminati initiates such as Daniel Coit Gilman,</strong> was the first step in <strong>transforming the entire medical practice of the United States</strong> from a patient-oriented, healing process to a totally different approach, in which <strong>the patient became an instrument to be manipulated for the benefit of various other programs, mainly experimental science.”</strong> 2:172</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins was sued for $1 billion for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maryland-lawsuit-infections-idUSKCN1OY1N3">infecting Guatemalans with Syphilis,</a> involved in <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/top-news/all-roads-lead-dark-winter/">Dark Winter</a> and knowingly upheld <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/doubts-about-johns-hopkins-research-have-gone-unanswered-scientist-says/2013/03/11/52822cba-7c84-11e2-82e8-61a46c2cde3d_story.html">fraudulent research.</a></p>

<p>Faulty PCR is driving the <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/12/03/ten-fatal-errors-scientists-attack-paper-that-established-global-pcr-driven-lockdown">case-demic.</a></p>
<p>&rt;“It appeared to him (Dr. James DeMeo) that the <strong>reported number of “Covid” deaths were being re-defined and subtracted from other causes of deaths; the people who died of “co-morbidities” were being shifted over into the Covid category.”</strong> ^3</p>
<p>CDC is an outgrowth of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">Rockefeller’s MCWA</a> and helps with cooking the books for the corrupt <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-settlement-history-fact/purdue-oxycontin-settlement-would-rank-among-largest-in-pharma-history-idUSKCN1VW2KL">pharmaceutical industry.</a></p>
<p>&rt;”After World War II, diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria or pneumonia no longer triggered mass fatalities in industrialized nations such as affluent America. This became a huge problem for institutions like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American epidemic authorities, as redundancy threatened. In 1949, a majority voted to eliminate the CDC completely. Instead of bowing out of a potentially very lucrative industry, the CDC went on an arduous search for viruses.” ^4</p>
<p><strong>United Nations of Rockefeller</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”The story of the extreme agitation of the Rockefellers to keep the <strong>UN</strong> in New York under their thumb is graphically related as the climax of the Joe Alex Morris series, The Rockefellers, in the Saturday Evening Post in the issue of January 13, 1951. (p. 121) ^5</p>
<p>&rt;Although the <strong>Rockefellers</strong> preferred not to be openly identified with the UN, they overtly <strong>dominated</strong> every move of its founding.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE ROCKEFELLERS</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Competition became extremely keen in this medical school business. As a consequence the overlords of medicine found that they were not gaining the full advantage which they had hoped from their medical schools. <strong>They thereupon set about establishing a monopoly of the medical school business and wiping out their competitors.</strong> ^6:93</p>
<p>&rt;The merchants-in-medicine, organized in the A.M.A., found allies in their fellow merchants in industry at the beginning of this century. It is peculiarly fitting that <strong>the agency that enabled them to monopolize the field of medicine and its education should be the General Education Board, an outgrowth of Doc William Rockefeller’s quack cancer cure and medicine show.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”The commercial interests and alliances of research institutions are less obvious but are quite as real as those of the drug manufacturers, when they are not identical. <strong>The establishment of the Rockefeller Institute marked the firm saddling of big business and its methods on medical research.</strong> From the start an alliance was formed with the American Medical Association.” ^6:107</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.” ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”The American Medical Association is the front for the Drug Trust.” ^7</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Food and Drug Bandits</strong></p>
<p>&rt;This Bureau — now known as the Food &amp; Drug Administration — is <strong>used primarily for the perversion of justice by "cracking down" on all who endanger the profits of the Drug Trust.”</strong> ^7</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Control of the Food and Drug Administration, health departments and other government agencies have given the Rockefeller Drug Cartel a virtual monopoly of marketing of drugs, especially of new drugs.”</strong> ^5:112</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”One of the officers of Schering Co., an affiliate of the Drug Trust, openly has stated that the maintenance of a drug monopoly is one of the objectives of the Food &amp; Drug Administration.”</strong> ^5:119</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Many so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever. <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable</strong> purposes and have been <strong>exploited commercially and intensively.”</strong> ^5:110</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefeller interests have steadily expanded their holdings in the drug industry to the point at which they control the major drug concerns in the world,</strong> and are rapidly absorbing new ones by the process of merger. They have all been integrated into a <strong>cartel</strong> that maintains an absolute monopolistic control of the drug industry.” ^5:112</p>
<p><strong>2010-Newport West MP Paul Flynn:</strong></p>
<p>"We know <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/10396382">the only people who benefited were pharmaceutical companies.</a> They had a huge influence in defining what a pandemic is."</p>
