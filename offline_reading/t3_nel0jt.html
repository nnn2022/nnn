    <strong>A journal entry of mine from 3/22/20, 2 days after I found empty shelves at every store I went to.</strong>
    <p><p>9 days before I lost my job, 11 days before I moved back to my hometown. I never fell for it, but I always knew it was about something more than what they were saying. </p>
<p>"I just wanna document how this last week has been. I started off rather skeptical. If not disregarding it's plausibility entirely. But now... It's not the sickness that scares me . For all we know it's all being portrayed by celebrities and crisis actors. It would make sense! How many of us know someone personally who has it? Anyway... I started out not believing it all and poking fun. But now I see that the govt is serious. They are testing us all and using this as a guinea pig virus on us all. They're preparing us. Martial law, one world govt. It's coming. I'm on edge. I haven't slept good. I'm Afraid I'll wake up to a message that my whole life has turned upside down. I'm going out every chance I get right now preparing for when I can't go out at all. Just pathetic. But I keep telling myself, if people can survive the many horrors of the past then I can survive this."</p></p>
