    <strong>Update to the subreddit rules</strong>
    <p><p>Just as an FYI, we have updated the rules for /r/NoNewNormal in order to address a few concerning trends that we've noticed.</p>
<p>Here are the revised rules:</p>
<p>&rt; 1) Scope of this subreddit: This subreddit discusses concerns regarding changes in society related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, described by some as a "new normal", and resistance to same.</p>
<p>This rule is unchanged.</p>
<p>&rt; 2) Treat all participants with respect: Please be civil in comments and posts, and treat all participants with respect.</p>
<p>This rule is unchanged.</p>
<p>&rt; 3) This is an inclusive community: Everyone is welcome to participate in this subreddit. Racism and other discriminatory conduct is not permitted.</p>
<p>This rule is completely new, and was envisioned as a corollary to rule #2, i.e. treat all participants with respect.  We had hoped that this sort of conduct's being out of bounds would have gone without saying, but having seen certain comments come through here, it apparently needs to be said.  In other words, no racism, no homophobia, no anti-semitism, and so on.</p>
<p>&rt; 4) No threats of violence: There is zero tolerance for threats of violence, incitement, or insinuation thereof.</p>
<p>We have added "incitement" to the list of banned behaviors covered under this rule.  Incitement, by definition, encourages unlawful behavior, and we cannot condone that in any way.  We typically issue permanent bans for violations of this rule on the first offense, so consider this rule your one and only warning.</p>
<p>&rt; 5) Please flair your posts accordingly: Please add flair to your posts.</p>
<p>This rule is unchanged.</p></p>

        <p>I hear what you are saying but having actually visited those subs, there was a huge percentage of posts talking about how Clinton should be killed and that kind of thing, it was in fact fairly violent fairly often.  Not saying that the dem subs all are paragons of virtue either as they are not but in comparison to many subs, we are are pretty mild here.  We are still mostly stuck in the old school method of just calling people idiots instead of actually calling for their death.  ;-P</p>

        <p>Sorry but I saw it myself. I frequent many subs of diff opinions and i would visit there occasionally just to see what was up and I saw it myself.  I went there before it was ever quarantined or Spez said anything.  There's a lot of vile anger and hatred on both sides of the political camp but I did see many many instances of people calling for killing people on that sub.  A lot of peeps seemed convinced that all dems were deep state baby blood drinkers and deserved jail or death by hanging.  Maybe the mods tried hard to control it, IDK but I know that when I went there, I saw many such posts.  To be fair, there were other subs that were also bad that did not get banned so I won't say politics and optics were not at play as well but that sub was often in violation of basic reddit TOS, I saw it myself many many many times first hand.  I saw it long before Spez had one word to even say about it.</p>

        <p>All I know is I went there and saw a lot of such posts.  I don't even care that much about dems or reps, I was just curious how about various stances on the issues.  I already admitted I don't know what the mods tried to do about it other than they did not get it cleaned up faster than it was easily visible. I make no claims about the rest.  Maybe it just hard for you to admit your sub was anything other than perfect and saintly at all times but that's not my issue, it's yours.</p>

        <p>This right here just shows your ignorance and you openly use it as a defense. Ignorance is not a defense, somehow you were simultaneously able to witness “a huge percentage” of posters reference the slaughter of Hillary Clinton but, somehow not able to see the giant stickied post at the top of the dom. Like seriously do you even hear yourself? Do you even comprehend the idiocy of what you are claiming? What you are saying is fucking dumb, you can’t see stickied posts by the mods but can see post that apparently an avid user just missed. Foh, this is complete and total bullshit, you have no idea what you are talking about. Deporting fedposters is a sport to us. We have people who watch ‘new’ 24/7 to deport shit like that, it absolutely is not something that is discussed, it is always promptly deported. BTFO</p>

        <p>LOL, maybe think about why you got triggered so easily. I don't even care enough about this subject to get insulted.  Somebody witnessed something that went against your preferred narrative and so you need to resort to insults.  Your side is not the perfect paragon of sweetness and light, neither is the other side, that's how the real world is, even if it hurts your emotions and causes you to lash out to protect your assumptions.  Acting irrational and insulting others just hurts your cause even more.  Confident mature people can express their opinions without insulting others.</p>

        <p>When I go to lots of subs, I just read the popular threads to see what the basic concepts and attitudes are. I don't plan to vet the mods or what they are trying to do, I am not trying to run the sub for them.  I just go there and notice the content of popular posts.  What i saw was a lot of hate but I wasn't really surprised because that's pretty common on politics subs.  Now you have asked me to prove what post were on a sub a year ago that was deleted, obviously you know that is impossible so way to go asking for the impossible.  If this concept hurts you that much as to go to such gyrations to protect yourself, maybe think about why you are reacting that way.</p>

        <p>In any case, I'm getting quite tired of the constant discussion about possible banning of the subreddit. Just enjoy it while it's here, and if it disappears one day, then so be it. It's quite demoralizing to constantly hear how the subreddit is going to be banned. So quit ruining the community with such negativity, for all of our sanity.</p>

<p>Okay, when we're talking about unlawful does that include violations of gubernatorial fiat? If my governor says "You can't have more than non-family members over for a visit" am I going to get a paddlin' for saying "Everyone should have a big get together with friends just to spite my idiot governor!"?</p>

        <p>OK so saying you are going to wave a protest sign or go to a restaurant or sit on a bench is not incitement correct?  Maybe clarify a bit. I am not a violent person at all but I was not sure what you meant.  Governments use the word 'incitement' for the tiniest of little activities sometimes and especially these days.  If you mean violence, maybe you should more specifically say that IMO.  I mean you SHOULD have a rule against incitement of violence, it's kind of so common in many subs that the enforce it without even having specific rules about it.  It's that obvious and I think it goes against reddit TOS anyway.  My subs do not allow it for that reason alone.</p>

        <p>I tend to agree. While there are certainly exceptions, the most hardcore COVID hysterics - which frequently just-so-happen to overlap with the middle-aged middle class who are currently driving the future prospects of young poor people further into the ground - seem more histrionic than ever before, and can't be convinced otherwise any more than you could convince those alien demon lizard illuminati conspiracy theorists that our dear leaders are simply dumb little humans like us. This is why I don't really care to "make a stand" or "convert" anyone, only to keep my loved ones as healthy and safe as humanly possible while we ride the waves of the social cycle. Expecting thousands, millions, billions of people to trust and respect each other is absolute folly. If there is any hope at all for peace and freedom, it isn't through convincing each other to see things from our prespective, but from agreeing to disagree. Secession and decentralization of like-minded communities.</p>

        <p>Are you labeling all republicans terrorists now? Like our Media and Democrat Politicians?</p>
<p>If I say "Joe Biden is a puppet of China and The Great Reset and stole the election and is milking the virus for power" for example, is that "Incitement"? Or is it too "Uncivil"? or perhaps considered "Racist"?</p>
<p>I'm very serious about this question. Your subreddit is one of the last few places on reddit that seems to allow free speech, and I'm wondering how free it can remain with these kinds of rules that can be subjectively applied to opinions.</p>

        <p>Running a sub is a tricky balance of steering without excessive force. If lots of memes get posted and get upvoted, that's the will of the sub.  Also what kind of fair rule can you make that limits but does not ban something, are you going to only allow 1 meme per day and delete the rest?  That's hard for mods to keep track of and enforce.  What if you get no memes for 4 days and then 4 in one day?  Too complicated and ultimately upvotes are part of how subs self police.</p>

        <p>Let me quote myself <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/l7k53b/update_to_the_subreddit_rules/glbfjcm/">from above</a>:</p>
<p>&rt; In any case, I'm getting quite tired of the constant discussion about possible banning of the subreddit. Just enjoy it while it's here, and if it disappears one day, then so be it. It's quite demoralizing to constantly hear how the subreddit is going to be banned. So quit ruining the community with such negativity, for all of our sanity.</p>

        <p>That's a cool story and all, but doesn't address what I actually said unless what you mean is that there is no backup. I was under the impression that there was a backup but I guess I had confused this subreddit with somewhere else if that isn't the case.</p>

<p>The rule change is in the context of our rule 4 which is incitement of violence which is directly from Reddit's official <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">content policy</a>.</p>

<p>Specific targeted response is the only workable solution. You don't quarantine healthy people from one another. You don't shut down businesses ability to operate.</p>
