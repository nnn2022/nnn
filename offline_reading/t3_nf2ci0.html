    <strong>The US is moving on and everyone in Canada is still terrified</strong>
    <p><p>As I see states removing mask mandates, opening restaurants and taking down plexi glass, here I sit in Canada, surrounded by people in complete fear.</p>
<p>Here are some conversations I have listened to at work:</p>
<p>"We'll probably have a double-lockdown after Summer. With all the cases in India, we will definitely have different variants, and more than just a few!"</p>
<p>This is someone who claims she hates masks and hates covid, yet she delightfully talks about how horrible everything coming is going to be.</p>
<p>"We'll probably require booster shots soon with how bad things are going in India"</p>
<p>Everyones fussing about India, variants and vaccines. I even had someone mock me by saying his 5g chip is activated since he got his johnson juice.</p>
<p>These people have no idea that USA is going to be done with COVID shortly, one state at a time. Most of my fellow Canadians want the boarder sealed. It's terrifying.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, unfortunately something is terribly wrong with these people.</p>
<p>From the very beginning they refused to see what's going on in Sweden, or simply to admit that nothing that shown on the screen happens in reality.</p>
<p>Like the reality doesn't exist anymore and they only way they can know what's going on is through "trusted" sources.</p>
<p>And don't believe anything else including their own eyes.</p>
<p>And I don't think it happened overnight, they've been demoralized for years of woke propaganda.</p>
<p>And all woke propaganda is about denying the obvious, and if you don't agree, you're a bigot, sexist, etc. etc.</p>

        <p>Man you haven't been to Australia.  Whatever Canada has or is bringing in Australia has done it for the last year. QR codes, 14 day quarantine,  curfews have all been brought in already and has been for a year.</p>
<p>We just had a poll that says 73% of Australians agree with keeping our international borders closed till at least July 2022 at a minimum or until 90% of our population is vaccinated and that includes children.</p>
<p>We are at 3% of our population fully vaccinated.</p>

        <p>We're completely open where I am here in western europe. People back to work. No curfews. Nobody using the face nappies unless entering a shop that is still requesting such, which is then removed upon exiting making a total mockery of the request.<br>
Vac centres and hospitals are empty but media still insists both operating are maximum capacity.<br>

Switch off the TV - Go back to normal.<br>

<p>Wait, which fucking country? Can I visit?</p>
<p>I heard Spain opened some stuff up again.</p>
<p>I am in Switzerland. People are still with the muzzles, they are talking about vaxxing kids, it's still illegal to sing in church or go dancing or anything like that. Never had curfews, and outdoor life has always been pretty relaxed. Currently can dine at restaurants outdoors but not indoors. Still will get kicked off the train if you don't wear the mask. Still are not allowing anti-corona demonstrations without police brutality.</p>

        <p>There are Canadians that do nothing except eat the drivel that our federally funded propaganda machine, I mean the CBC, spits out and constantly recite the same bullshit talking points that the "news" does.</p>
<p>When the AZ vaccine was first getting reports of blood clots, they had a doctor go on TV and say that the chances of you getting a blood clot from the AZ vaccine is "1 in 35 million". My aunt and other family members said "oh what a low risk, that's like only one person in all of Canada getting a clot, what's so bad?" and I had to remind them that's not how odds work, since winning the lottery has odds of 1 in (upwards of) 100 billion and there's less people on the planet than that, yet people still win the lottery. I got ignored and told that there's no risk of taking the vaccine. Now Canada is in a shit position where they have to look at mixing vaccines for second dose because AZ shot was taken off the market (for risk of blood clots, go figure lmao) and thousands of Canadians are now shit out of luck for their second dose. </p>
<p>I've had people tell me that "you have to wear a mask because you don't know if people are sick", and when you tell them that yes, you absolutely can tell when people are sick and asymptomatic transmission is false, they say "well <em>I</em> can't tell if someone is sick so ill just wear my mask". </p>
<p>Fucking clown world.</p>
