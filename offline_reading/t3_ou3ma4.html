        <p>Exactly. Stop complying. Don’t support people or businesses who support this medical apartheid. There are easy ways to start resisting. I feel like people think they have to wait until it turns into combat to do so. If we were smart, we’d stop this before it gets to that point</p>

        <p>Dump Netflix, Facebook and Google -- all who have just mandated vaccines for their employees.</p>
<p>I've just switched from Google Chrome to Epic Privacy Browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epicbrowser.com/">https://www.epicbrowser.com/</a></p>
<p>It's Chrome-based, so just like using Chrome but a) Google makes no money from it and b) Google isn't saving your private data (neither is Epic).</p>
<p>I've also just talked my parents into dumping Netflix (I don't have it).</p>
<p>And I've permanently closed my Facebook account today.</p>
<p>Oh, and I am still watching as much as I want on YouTube (Google-owned), but I now have AdBlock running on every channel I watch. So...it costs Google money for me to watch their videos, but they make zero money from me doing it.</p>
<p>I recommend these as a start, because we have to fight back wherever we can.</p>

        <p>From their FAQ: </p>
<p>Is Epic Open Source?</p>
<p>All of Epic's code is visible and auditable by anyone. We are committed to complete transparency (as you know from reading this page) about how Epic works and doesn't work. We love open source software and Epic is built on open source Chromium. If you would like to audit any files, please let us know. We have released many files to developers who needed help -- so if you need help, just write us. If you would like to contribute to Epic, please write us with your specific background and what you'd like to work on. We'd love your help, but we've gotten many offers but no one has actually followed through with a contribution to date (it's okay, working on Chromium is hard :-). Chromium which Epic is built on is open source software which anyone can immediately download and audit. No one has written us regarding auditing chromium, but we'd love to hear ideas on how as a community we can continue to make sure Chromium is safe and private. If you have any questions, please write us. </p>
<p>That's a lot of words to say "no." Especially since they don't ever come out and say it. Why would I contact them to audit the code? Just include a link. That's two reasons not to trust them in one, they're closed source and misleading about it.</p>

<p>Epic has a built in VPN and built in AdBlock (you just need to activate it). I also go through another VPN for everything I do online, so my data is going thru 2 VPNs and a much safer browser than Google.</p>
<p>Here is also more info on Epic from Nord VPN,  a company that really takes privacy seriously.</p>
<p><a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/best-privacy-browser/">https://nordvpn.com/blog/best-privacy-browser/</a></p>
<p>I don't use Nord, but another VPN, but they recommend using it.</p>
<p>At this point though, for me it's not really about privacy (as believe me, I'm privacy-ed up more than most already :) ) -- it's about not having one second of my time putting more money into Google's pockets, so I'm happy with Epic at the moment.</p>
<p>Feel free to recommend a 'safer' browser tho (as long as it runs similarly to Chrome) and I'm happy to take a look.</p>
<p>I do also se Tor for some of the things I do online, but it's so slow it's not useful for everything.</p>

        <p>They laugh at your peaceful protests. It doesn't do anything besides let them know you don't like the choices they're making for you... which they're already fully aware of. Holding up a sign and marching around outside of a building does not stop the pen from hitting paper and orders going out. The United States was literally founded on the idea that if shit gets too out of control, it's your duty to physically go stop it.</p>

        <p>So what do we do then... molotov parliament? Then we get blasted as terrorists and our movement gets belittled into some viral day long read and becomes just a random thing that happened. No one cares anymore and I dont think protests work for this issue, this thing is bigger the  us and I think it will become a war, if our side survives the first wave of mandates...</p>

        <p>They say Covid is the new 9/11. We should have resisted the creation of a surveillance state then. We must resist the rise of the needle-sticking, bio-sample taking state now. After our bodily autonomy is taken away, there is no barrier left for government to tear down. </p>

        <p>how can it be a way forward when people are still able to contract/spread covid after the experimental gene therapy is injected? and still being asked to wear a mask? at this point the injection was useless</p>

massive wealth transfers to China , pharmaceutical companies, testing kit manufacturers, online product corporations (Amazon, Netflix)</p>
