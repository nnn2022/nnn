    <strong>Evidence vs Proof</strong>
    <p><p>It's becoming frustrating and even a bit concerning the way that people keep using the term "proof" when they actually mean "evidence". Proof and evidence are not the same thing and it's important that you know the difference.</p>
<p>There are generally two kinds of proof: mathematical proofs and <em>all other kinds</em> of proof. But for this post I'm only going to talk about mathematical proofs (which are arguably the only "real" kind of proof) and scientific proof.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A mathematical proof is something that is absolutely true: A series of logical deductions based on axioms that lead to a proposition and assuming the logical deductions and base axioms are free of errors then <em>no evidence can disprove the proposition</em>. The proposition is <em>true and will always remain true</em>. The proposition is <em>irrefutable</em>. The proposition is <strong>proven</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A scientific proof is arguably an oxymoron because science doesn't actually deal with proof like maths does (well, perhaps in physics they do - I'm not sure). As the evidence in favour of the scientific theory mounts, and counter-evidence doesn't, then the theory becomes increasingly likely to the extent that you could <em>casually</em> say the theory is "proven". However, in a strict sense this does NOT mean the theory is proven. There is no reason that some counter-evidence could still be discovered that contradicts the theory. It may be increasingly unlikely, but it's not impossible. Therefore the theory is <em>not actually proven</em>. Instead, it is more accurate to discuss <em>how likely</em> the theory is true: not very likely, possible, probable, very likely etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is far more appropriate to <em>not</em> talk about "proof" when discussing science and to only talk about <em>evidence</em> for a theory. Furthermore, how much evidence there is and how strong that evidence is. If you ever study scientific literature you will notice they always say something like "the results of our experiments <em>suggest</em> that the theory is true". You will almost never - if ever - see scientific literature say "we have <em>proven</em> that the theory is true".</p>
<p>So what is evidence? Here is the <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/evidence">dictionary definition</a>:</p>
<p><em>The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.</em></p>
<p>Of highest importance in this definition is the word <em>indicating</em>, because this is what evidence does. Evidence doesn't absolutely show a theory to be true - that would be proof - and instead evidence only <em>indicates</em> or <em>suggests</em> a theory is true. The key implication is that it is possible that the conclusions drawn from the evidence are wrong. Furthermore, it is possible for there to simultaneously exist evidence in favour of a theory but also against a theory. With proof, this is not possible. There cannot be proof that a proposition is true and simultaneously proof showing the proposition is false. If that were to happen then at least one of the proofs <em>must by definition</em> be erroneous.</p>
<p>In short, proof is conclusive whereas evidence is inconclusive; proof does not leave room for doubt whereas evidence does leave room for doubt.</p>
<p>Another facet of evidence is how <em>strong</em> the evidence is. For example in law if you have a human witness to a crime their testimony may be weak to moderate evidence. If you have video footage of the crime taking place this is much stronger evidence (I expect, although I am not a lawyer). One piece of strong evidence can be worth a hundred pieces of weak evidence. Just because you have some weak evidence in support of a theory in no way means the theory is likely. If you have a lot of strong evidence in support of a theory then you can perhaps say that the theory is likely.</p>
<p>What frustrates me is when a person makes a post saying "here is proof that face masks do/don't work" but then link to some evidence and not proof. Not only that, but <em>weak</em> evidence. The problem is because this means that the "proof" (which isn't actually proof) can be readily contradicted by an opponent with counter-evidence or logical counter-argument, but the person claiming they have proof doesn't realise that their opponent's rebuttal is perfectly valid and decide to die on a hill that their "proof" confirms absolutely their claim and that their opponent cannot possibly be right. This leads to a lot of unproductive and increasingly hostile argument.</p>
<p>So be well aware of the difference between proof and evidence - how science doesn't actually deal with proof, how evidence can be strong or weak, how the amount of evidence is a factor, and if there is counter-evidence for a theory. Because I have definitely seen evidence both in favour and against using face masks so it's not a black and white argument, yet a lot of pro- and anti-mask people treat it as if it is.</p>
<p>My strong advice is to look at all the evidence for a theory - both for and against it - to see which body of evidence is strongest. Don't just ignore evidence that doesn't support your opinions because this is intellectually dishonest. And lastly, <em>never</em> say you have "proof" because you almost certainly don't have proof. Instead say "here is evidence suggesting a theory". I also encourage you call out your opponents when they claim to have "proof" because they almost certainly don't either.</p></p>

        <p>i concur, evidence is not 'proof'</p>
<p>i have pointed this fact out to many and it falls on deaf ears</p>
<p>also the heavy use of use weasel words that when removed reveals the lack of any truth. words such as can, may. might, could, suggests, and 'if'</p>

        <p>Indeed, in many sentences those words can be replaced without loss of validity with the phrases "may not", "might not" etc.</p>
<p>Although "suggests" can be used validly and honestly, and it is often necessary to qualify your conclusions with the word "if" to detail the required assumptions for your conclusion to be valid. Again, this isn't necessarily weasily. But sometimes they definitely are used as weasel words.</p>
