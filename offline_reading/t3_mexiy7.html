        <p>The beauty of it from there end is if they need numbers to skyrocket, adjust the CT higher and then if they need it lower they can reverse it... Insanity how the mandates and every single aspect of the scamdemic is ran with falsified information</p>

        <p>I called an embassy to ask them why they required a negative pcr test if the tests are so reliable. They told me that they are very reliable. So I sent them a link explaining that they're not. No reply.</p>

        <p>Most people don't actively research such things. They simply read it in the newspapers. And this far I don't know about any major one discussing the well known unreliability of PCR-tests, especially when run at higher cycles.</p>

        <p>I got into it with someone the other day about the supposed "greater mortality" of variants, and they linked me a study. I read the study as well as the peer reviews, and pointed out to this person that a few of the peer reviewers themselves raised some issues with the way the data was gathered and even presented alternative explanations for the conclusions. </p>
<p>I also raised an issue with the sample size since the conclusion stated that in their results the variant had a higher mortality rate per 1000 than regular covid, when their sample size was only 54,000. I said that I felt such a small sample size wasn't enough to make a definitive conclusion when dealing with a statistic of x per 1000, it only warranted further study at best. </p>
<p>He didn't bother to address any of that and just said he trusted the "the experts" more than some "crazy Facebook conspiracy group" guy. I basically called him out on the fact that it was clear he never actually read the study and simply linked the first google result that supported his narrative, and accepted it because it seemed to come from an authoritative source. I said said hey bud that's called accepting arguments from authority, which is a logical fallacy as well as being fundamentally unscientific. He then called me "uneducated" lol</p>
<p>I was like "so are the doctors and scientists in the peer reviews that you didn't bother to read uneducated crazy conspiracists too, or is that just your childish way of coping with the fact that your whole 'I fucking love science' veneer got totally demolished by someone who actually bothered to verify the science?"</p>
<p>Still haven't gotten a response.</p>
