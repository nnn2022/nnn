    <strong>Would you agree if you no longer need to wear mask or take the vaccine if you agree not to be saved or treated should you get covid?</strong>
    <p><p>Say one day government came up with a proposal or people not to get vaccinated or wear mask but the condition is they will self decline to be treated for symptoms related to covid, including giving up their spot for an ICU bed, would you agree to this and sign it off so no one can condemn you no more about your antimask and antivax preference?</p></p>

        <p>No, that would be the same as refusing to give an overweight person insulin because they chose an unhealthy lifestyle or to refuse treatment to someone who needs lifesaving treatment who fell off a cliff and survived because they were rock climbing and that's a risk that was unnecessary to take. Refusing treatment for any reason goes against the Hippocratic oath.</p>
<p>Such a proposal has nothing to do with health and everything to do with punishing people you disagree with.</p>

        <p>80% of Covid hospitalizations are obese individuals. I guess we should not treat obese individuals since they “introduced a preventable risk factor” using this kind of logic (notwithstanding that not being vaccinated doesn’t mean you’ve created any kind of meaningful increase in risk if your risk was already negligible).</p>

        <p>For some it can be genetic, for others it can be due to medications, or just illness that affects their metabolism allowing them to get fat even when they eat normal.</p>
<p>So we should only laugh at fat people who they decided themselves to be fat, not fat people that became fat that is not their choice.</p>

        <p>What is “normal person?” Eat your vegetables, learn the actual serving size of meat and carbs, which is actually small, and don’t keep sugary stuff in the pantry. Give yourself an ice cream or something you enjoy once or twice a week. Soak oatmeal overnight in a tupperware for breakfast instead of Lucky Charms. Chicken and green beans on some rice for dinner. Make extra for lunch the next day instead of sandwiches and fast food. Plain greek yogurt with berries for a snack. Go on a walk after dinner or get up an hour early and hit the gym before work.</p>
<p>“Normal” in western society is massively unhealthy and most people couldn’t even tell you what a serving size of anything is or how many calories are in a tablespoon of peanut butter or how much sugar should be the max per day. “Normal” doesn’t mean starving yourself it means taking care of what you put in. You do you though, it’s all individual choice not anyone else’s responsibility. I say this as someone who managed to lose a large amount of weight and keep it off because it wasn’t a diet, it was a lifestyle change and working towards improving my self control. It’s harder for some than others but it’s not impossible and it doesn’t involve starving. Diets don’t work because their is no easy quick fix, it takes a lot of effort.</p>

        <p>No. I struggle with my weight. And I know exactly what to do and how hard it is. And it is 100% on me. I have been very fit and I've been overweight and had to lose a significant amount more than once. It can be done. It can be maintained, but it takes work if you have a sedentary job and access to inexpensive high-calorie foods, like we do these days.</p>

        <p>For some people, their weight remains constant no matter they are eating more or less. So pretty sure genetics have a lot to do with it.</p>
<p>If you have bad metabolism rate, you have to eat less, sometimes much less, that would be a struggle for many people but you cannot out the blame 100% on them.</p>
<p>It is like saying people are poor because they chose to be poor. Try saying it to guys like kids of bill gates. They cant be poor even if they tried. So genetics will make it easier or harder to gain weight for people, for those with bad metabolism they will have to suffer to prevent getting overweight.</p>

        <p>Hi, understand the difference between not eating, vs normal eating, vs over eating...</p>
<p>I already said if the person with genetic disorder slims down and starts eating like a normal person the person will still become fat because they either have bad metabolism or on some medication like steroid related medications.</p>

        <p>We never know what kind of new virus will show up, might not have anything to do with covid but labelled as a variant.</p>
<p>You dont get what you paid for..poor people who pay less tax enjoys the same benefits as people who paid more. This is not what i would call you get what you paid for.</p>
<p>They get priority because they did their part in vaxxing up, something the government and big pharma been pushing for. These are paying customers that would pay for future booster shots, so why would they not get priority even if it doesnt sound fair?</p>
<p>Fauci is the law. Remember the time people said vaccines wouldnt be mandated? Well we are very close to a vaccine mandate.</p>

        <p>Let’s say you get the vaccine but you’re obese, being obese is the number one part of being in hospital period except maybe being super old, fat people are not doing their part in helping society or themselves.</p>
<p>Then let’s take me for example, I’m a 20 year old man who is fit, never smoked, only drank responsibly, never done drugs, I eat well and look after myself, the only thing ‘wrong’ with me in your scenario is I haven’t got vaccinated,</p>
<p>Why should the fat guy who has knowingly zigged when he should have zagged his entire life get a bed over me? I am more responsible than him at every turn except the vaccine, what give vaccination the right to trump every other thing leading up to being hospitalised?</p>

        <p>Who promotes fast food? The government? I’ve never heard them do that they’re always saying don’t eat a MacDonald’s, hospitals then? I’ve never heard a doctor say eat a KFC.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen an advert for fast food that isn’t from said fast food company and over the last few years especially where I’m from they’ve been forced to sell healthy alternatives on their own menu.</p>
<p>Capitalism needs workers, people in hospital don’t work, hospitals will spend more money treating someone than they get for doing so, that’s why governments subsidise them, I don’t think you have a very good understanding on how the world works.</p>

        <p>Yo not everyone in the hospital never worked or have any savings, or have totally broke relatives and family members to pay for the fees and medication, there are still insurance and welfare paying for them too. Those fast food workers will work their whole live and get treated in hospital and rely on medications when they get older, isnt this a wonderful system? You get people working for you when they are young and you get them to pay you for the services provided by your young workers when they are young who will pay you back when they get old.</p>

        <p>I do believe it. And the gain-of-function research, which the US helped fund, is why I believe it was basically a bioweapon. What I don't know is whether it was released accidentally or intentionally.  Are the newest variants developing naturally or not? I have no idea. Is it amazing or suspicious that Pfizer, Moderna, etc had vaccines ready so quickly? Are these companies 'good guys' I can trust, or have they (or their equivalents) killed thousands of people and paid billions in fines previously by falsifying or hiding research about side effects to rush a drug to market?</p>

        <p>I dont believe it is a bioweapon. But you can say it has been used in a global biological warfare. To me it is more of a tool instead of bioweapon.</p>

        <p>Erm most virus are researched in hope they can understand the virus more and come up with a solution. Usually these are done for financial gains. If it was developed as a bioweapon, we would not be seeing any vaccines so quick after the "leaks".</p>
<p>Its like asking if theres any cure for radiation exposures from a nuclear bomb, which is clearly a weapon, even if you are using it to blow up an asteroid to save earth, a nuclear bomb is still a weapon.</p>
<p>It is possible the findings of corona research be used to develop a more lethal virus to be used as a bioweapon, that still doesnt mean corona was created as a bioweapon, at least not at this stage. It might have been developed for multiple goals and one of them maybe related to a bioweapon development plan, but im sure corona is not a bioweapon.</p>

        <p>Some of the first virologists who suspected it did not develop naturally noticed that it contained sequences that could never happen naturally. Figuring out how to make a virus more infectious has no other application.</p>

        <p>Like i said, researching a contagious virus is still financially triggered. The data may be used to develop a more lethal and contagious virus for weapon purpose, but like most weapons of mass destruction, its original intent was for either greater of mankind or financial gains. A virus like corona would help spread a mild virus which would require vaccination that brings lots of profit to companies.</p>
<p>You know, if there is no demand for your product and services (like security), create demands. Military might learn about the research and decided that the development may be useful in weapon development programs like darpa, and we have nuclear studies being utilized to develop nuclear reactors, and also nuclear bombs.</p>
<p>I believe the bombings of labs in Wuhan to destroy evidence. Someone was laid to leak the virus, lab had no control over it and decides to bomb them.</p>
<p>Labs in other regions released their own version of the virus to accelerate the spread and make it harder to tackle with all the "variants". Finally all "evidence" will point towards china and the worlds start claiming trillions of dollars of damage from china. China refuses to pay and admit their fault )which obviously they are framed for their own stupidity), UN goes to war with china, if success, china will split just like ussr.</p>

        <p>To me, what was going on at the Wuhan lab is no different than, lets say, working in a lab to genetically modify mosquitoes to somehow make them harder to kill or make it easier for them to carry malaria. Perhaps modifying a species that don't currently carry malaria (or some other deadly disease). Just to see. Because of science and research and maybe it will be useful somehow. And then crying foul if my mosquitoes escape the lab in some way, and there's a deadly epidemic, perhaps in country that has eradicated malaria. Because everything I was doing was for science and research. Or maybe the epidemic itself isn't all that bad, but there are other effects.</p>
<p>I am aware that the death rate for COVID is not anything to be afraid of, though I do believe it is a real disease. A bioweapon does not have to be used for mass death - what we got instead is actually far worse, in the results of lockdowns, economic issues, deaths for other reasons (delayed treatments or surgeries for other conditions, suicides, etc), and the psychological effect of all of the above.</p>

        <p>If there arent enough beds, and doctors have to make a choice, they will have some biased decisions, so if the person is a hardcore religious person and anti lbgt their decisions may sway and yea the gay guy might not get the bed.and it might just be a subconscious level of decisions.</p>
<p>So naturally when it boils down to you who willingly gets unvaccinated vs a vaccinated person, a medical professional who would most likely be a provaxxer, will probably be biased in making the decision to give the bed to the one who is vaxxed.</p>

        <p>Sure. Most of these treatments were bad in general and chances that I would need those without the vaccine are minimal.</p>
<p>This changes nothing. I prefer to risk the CoVid with all we know it entails rather than risk the vacvine with a huge amount of unknown risks, on top of what is already confirmed.</p>

<p>Either take this experimental injection for a disease you have a 99% probability of being fine with, or choose to be left for dead if you suffer from any symptoms that relate to Covid.  Symptoms like fever and shortness of breath, symptoms that also cover a plethora of other diseases and conditions.  </p>

        <p>LMAO substitute AIDS/HIV with COVID and see if you can answer that question for us. In spite of all the protections granted to people with that diagnosis, it is well-known that the two primary ways it spreads is unprotected anal sex and IV drug use. For that matter, consider any other STD that is treated by medical professionals, that is covered by health insurance, and so on.</p>
<p>Or consider the lifestyle issues for many type 2 diabetics or many cancer patients, that directly contributed to or caused their disease (smoking, poor diet, lack of exercise, etc).</p>
<p>I mean absolutely no disrespect, by the way, to anyone suffering from any of the above. I'm simply pointing out that we treat diseases even if the person suffering from it somehow contributed to it.</p>
<p>I frequently review patient medical records as part of my job. Regardless of why they came to the ER, often their drug abuse, STD, alcoholism, or other condition is treated as well. This inflates their bill and whether they have private insurance or are on a public program, in the end everyone else is contributing to paying for it. I'm not suggesting NOT to do this, just pointing out that it is happening.</p>

        <p>When people smoke, their insurance premium is higher..people who work in high risk jobs like construction have higher job insurance premiums, sports cars generally has higher insurance premiums than normal cars even when they are worth the same price. Young drivers generally pay more insurance premiums than old. Of you refuse to get vaccinated you increase your chance of getting more severe symptoms should you unfortunately get infected, which is a risk magnified if you also refuse to wear a mask, so naturally your decisions will result in you ending up paying more, in what form, we will know soon.</p>
<p>Insurance companies already drawing up new plans for the unvaccinated group. Insurance will soon no longer cover complications due to covid related illness for the unvaccinated. Insurance wont cover complications from emergency approved vaccines, but they will still cover covid related treatment.</p>

        <p>Oh I have no doubt that is true, about refusing to cover the condition, or higher premiums. And I am aware of the higher premiums for smoking. What is amazing is the complete double standard, which is what I am trying to draw attention to and it is for protection of select groups, who we permit to make terrible decisions and protect from consequences.</p>
<p>My company charges higher premiums for tobacco users, but not for the obese and sedentary. And from my observations (when I still worked in an office) it was the obese and sedentary (non-smokers) who were being treated for multiple chronic conditions and having constant doctor's appointments and going out on medical leave, not the handful of smokers we had there. </p>
<p>I also expect that my company and others like it, who now have permanent work-from-home policies and cannot reasonably require us to get vaccinated, will tie the vaccine to insurance premiums to try to coerce us. </p>
<p>And seriously, please just imagine if an company tried to charge gay men higher insurance premiums on that basis alone.</p>

        <p>Dont this just means your company is making more money out of these obese people because they have multiple complications which requires multiple treatment and multiple medications? Someone is paying for it, and it surely aint your company, maybe they pay it out of their pocket, or the insurance, or the government, the key point is everyone except the patients are making money. If public medical expenses rise, just increase the tax, or come up with new taxes, people pay for it, business and governments make more money.</p>
<p>As for smokers who arent obese, their complications are usually more limited to high bp, heart and respiratory issues. Not as lucrative as obese patients.</p>

        <p>How would my company be making more money off them? The healthcare industry certainly is, in the form of deductibles and co-insurance. The point I am making is that the company healthcare plan, which, if we want remotely affordable insurance is the one we have to purchase, is penalizing certain lifestyle choices, but not others. Based on which groups have been chosen as protected (gay, fat, etc). </p>
<p>And that seems to be the point you want to make - that if someone chooses not to get vaccinated for COVID, no matter what their reasons, that they should be penalized and have to forgo treatment, which is simply NOT something that we do to others.</p>
<p>Even smokers, if they have health insurance, and are paying a premium on it, can still be treated should they begin to experience health conditions as a direct result of it. For that matter, even without insurance of any kind, they can and will receive treatment in an ER, as can all of the other groups I mentioned.</p>

        <p>Theres 2 different discussion here. Main title ask if you are willing to forgo treatment to avoid vaccine and masks, since many folks thinks covid is fake, i mean why not? They get left alone nobody gonna knock on their doors to vaccinate them or shame them say if they agreed not to be treated.</p>
<p>The 2nd discussion is that if beds are limited there will be decisions made, the decisions maybe biased or unfair that may probably favor the vaccinated. The authorities would also want to save an vaccinated elderly vs a non vaccinated adult, because they want to avoid any deaths on vaccinated people if they can, news that bring bad image to vaccines are never desired.</p>

        <p>I understand. And some probably do think COVID is fake. I am not one of those people. </p>
<p>And yes, they probably will do exactly what you describe to help limit the bad news for the vaccinated, because there's clear propaganda going on, plus various coercive tactics / manipulation to try to get everyone to take the vaccine. I strongly object to anything falling into that area for the reasons I've laid out.</p>

        <p>I would but, with many terms, am getting close to retirement, so I would put in a paper that they will have to sign, 1. Give me all the money I have pay in taxes, 2. Give me all the money they would pay for Medicare and medicine, (just like a regular retiree person) 3. Allow doctors to talk to me face time and be able to give me distance treatment if I need it and machines if is needed it ( the payment for that will come from the money they have given me) now if they refuse to give me money from Medicare, then treat me at home and continue as regular person receiving Medicare. So far, I don't go to doctors but just regular checkups, I don't have health issues and the ones I have I use natural medicine, I had asthma and I cured it with natural meds and I have talked to my kids that if I get sick from the virus, do not take me to the hospital.</p>
