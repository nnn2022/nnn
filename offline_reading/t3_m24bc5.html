    <strong>Speaking With People About COVID-19, Being Cordial and Agreeing to Disagree and Still Wanting to Come Over for Tea</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>So I just finished talking with a colleague, we'll call him Adam. Like the British would say, he's a good bloke! None the less, he came over to our office to fix a cabinet that went off the hinge because of the cabinet being over stuffed. The cabinet happened to be in the back area, where I am at. I asked him about how, and what caused the hinge to be broken, and we strike up a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p>As he was doing his thing, he asked, hey, you mind if I take off the mask, I said, hey, its all cool. We strike up a conversation about COVID-19, NY governor, and the other governors that killed the elderly in their care, etc. We both exchange brief views on the situation, he claims he had COVID, headache, and cough, a week to recover. For me, I tell him, so far so good, never had it and been doing my thing. The whole time as we are talking we are friendly, openly candid, talking about working with COVID, we're friendly, we disagree, but did I mention we were friendly to one another? </p>
<p>The ending of our talk, went like this, and this was the take away for me. </p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Hey, yeah, we disagree about this COVID thing, but hey, if you ever have any computer problems, swing by and we'll take a look. </p>
<p><strong>Adam</strong>: It was good to get to know you, definitely let me know if you need any other else and hope to see you around! Stay safe!</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: You too, man!</p>
<p><strong>The Take Away</strong>: Being cordial, and nice, even if you disagree will go a long way than being an outright Karen or SS Trooper, screaming and yelling. If we had more dialog rather than animosity, imagine the difference it would make when talking to those you disagree with regarding COVID. Unfortunately, you can not negotiate with some one or people (doomers) who have been convinced that your destruction or imprisonment is necessary for life to go on.</p>
<p>Any ways, I just thought I would relay this to the sub-reddit while it was fresh in my head since it literally just happened moments ago.</p></p>
