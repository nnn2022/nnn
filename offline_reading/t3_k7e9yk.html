    <strong>This false logic has got to stop: “You’re endangering my life by not wearing a mask,” and how to respond.</strong>
    <p><p>This pervasive logic by doomers is false and devilish. It makes zero sense in the context of our societal norms (at least the western world). Unfortunately, few Doomers are actually capable of comprehending such reasoning, evident in their doomerism. Nevertheless, here’s why it’s wrong and how you should respond:</p>
<p>Someone starts by making the idiotic statement “if you’re not wearing a mask, you’re putting my life and the lives of others around you at risk.”</p>
<p>There is only one conceivable case in which you’re putting the lives of others at risk in the context of C19, and that’s <em>if,</em> and <em>only if</em> you are infected with C19 and capable of spreading it. That’s literally the only way you’d be harmful to someone else.</p>
<p>Now, the blatantly false logic of the doomers is on full display. They are assuming <em>everyone</em> and their mother is infected with C19, completely ignoring individuals who are healthy. A perfectly normal guy might walk into a Walmart maskless. Is he putting other’s lives at risk? Absolutely not. The answer is the same as it would be in pre-COVID times. He’s healthy for Christ’s sake. He can’t infect anyone. Yet the doomer will say, without a shred of evidence, that this maskless guy is harmful. You see, their reasoning ultimately boils down to this:</p>
<p>&rt;Not wearing a mask makes you dangerous to others</p>
<p>When the correct logic is:</p>
<p>&rt;Being infected with C19 makes you dangerous to others</p>
<p>Was this logic even in question in 2019? Did you ever once see someone wearing a mask in public? Of course not, because our societal norms allow us to go maskless when we have no reason to believe we are contagious. Heck, our norms even allowed us to go maskless when we <em>were</em> sick with certain diseases, albeit non-severe ones, to be fair. </p>
<p>But in 2019, if someone had just become infected with, let’s say, Leprosy and had not shown symptoms yet, were they chided for showing up somewhere? Of course not, the leper had no reason to believe he was sick. The same is and should be true for Covid. If you have no reason to believe you are sick, you should not be forced nor shamed for not wearing a mask. Did people shame nurses for not wearing masks around immunocompromised old people in long term care facilities during flu seasons past? Of course not, even though they theoretically could have done damage asymptomatically. </p>
<p>The doomer logic is akin to saying everyone should wear a condom when he has sex, regardless if you’ve tested positive for HIV or not, so we can slow the spread of HIV. That’s ridiculous reasoning. The normal, rational individual might reply by saying “shouldn’t only those who have tested HIV+ have to wear condoms!” And you’d be correct in your reasoning. </p>
<p>Hopefully this explanation of my line of reasoning will help some of you respond to doomers and show them the fault in their logic. I suspect many of you already think this way, but hopefully something I said puts it in a new light or phrasing. </p>
<p>Let me know what y’all think.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. That’s another argument about who is responsible for one’s health?</p>
<p>We in this sub clearly accept that an individual is the only one responsible for his health, exception being of someone knows they are dangerous and go around coughing on people or whatever. </p>
<p>It’s up to the individual to shelter in place to avoid illness, not my role to alter my behavior to accommodate your health.</p>

        <p>The truth is that deep deep down, they’re not actually afraid of the virus. Like people who go to restaurants then post a review saying they saw a waiter’s mask slip or some other protocol wasn’t followed and they felt like they were in danger but still ate food there and lingered. </p>
<p>The truth is more that they’re enjoying their easily wielded excuse to lord over others and play health police. </p>
<p>The further truth is that a lot of these people say this shit online but haven’t actually done any of it in public and probably cut rule corners themselves and mentally bury it in cognitive dissonance. These people are assholes just enjoying pretending to be caring and badass online.</p>

        <p>they’re really not afraid of the virus at all. Its now about spreading it to somebody who can spread it to somebody who could die from it. They know that even if they got covid they would most likely be ok. They just “cant live with themselves” if they were patient zero of an outbreak.</p>

        <p>You sound like a conservative with all that self responsibility mumbo jumbo. It's funny how the political spectrum plays such a big part in the mask debate. The same people who think it's the government's responsibility to distribute wealth are the same people who think it's your responsibility to keep them from getting sick.</p>

        <p>What OP wrote has to be the most immature selfish post I have ever seen.
People are getting infected, someone must be infecting them.  You are preaching the trump theory of less testing and we will have less cases. If that was case with condoms and AIDS or other STI's  nobody would wear a condom until they were tested and confirmed positive.  Nobody would wear a seatbelt until the day they knew they were going to be in an car accident. Trump lost put your mask on</p>

        <p>Maybe because you aren't skilled in the fields, you aren't qualified to give a statement, you know, unlike the experts, scientists, and doctors who do this and study this for a living? Or do you magically have answers about a field you're not skilled in that somehow proves them wrong?</p>

        <p>The whole concept of “common sense” is used to try and sway dissenters to conformity. It’s trying to use the idea that “everybody agrees with what I’m saying so just shut up and obey.”</p>

        <p>Ok ok BUT,  common sense is something that everyone should know, don’t punch a beehive, don’t out a fire with oil etc. if you believe that plastic will be breathed in with a mask, why WOULDNT you breathe in covid. Instead of arguing that I’m dumb, Tell me why I’m dumb, show me the research that says that masks are harmful to me, also, condoms have a purpose outside of STDs, birth control, also also, people want to be careful, an STD is incurable, and horrible.</p>
<p>Individual sense, is just thinking by putting your experience into practice while common sense is putting other peoples experience into practice, I genuinely hope that you wear a mask and be safe to those around you!</p>

        <p>This has been a huge mindset change in society over the last 40 years, and it is one that is incredibly dangerous to liberty.</p>
<p>The change I am referring to is the constant expectation that to defend my position or my rights, <em>I am expected to prove a negative.</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>- We have gone from "I will judge you only by your overt actions towards minorities" to "You must prove to me you <em>aren't</em> a racist!!!".</p>
<p>- We have gone from "If you are a quiet, mostly law-abiding citizen we will assume you are OK", to "You are all terrorists until you prove otherwise! Now take off your belt and shoes!!!"</p>
<p>- We have gone from "You are successful. You must be a good businessman", to "You are successful. You must be a money-laundering tax cheat. Now hand over your financial records!!!"</p>
<p>- Now with WuFlu it's "Your are a filthy disease vector! Wear that fucking mask and stay in your pod, slave!!!"</p>

        <p>There are a handful but I don’t think it’s fair to say “too many.” Think of the millions of small businesses and compare that to the number of cheats you actually have seen reports on... pretty small ratio.</p>

        <p>Facemasks form me is equivalent to smoking cigarettes. It limits physical performance that's a given and plastic particles end up in your lungs over time. At the same time whoever tries to claim about disease spreading he has to prove that on a case by case basis. </p>
<p>Because someone can't just accuse you of disease spread without specific evidence. People are different and handle their bodies differently. Just because someone is sick it doesn't mean everyone else is sick.</p>

<p>Exactly my friend! The logic of sweeping mask mandates and shaming is essentially making a wild guess as to who might be harmful, without any evidence. Altering people’s behavior based on a guess is wrong.</p>

        <p>Inflicting a microscopic risk is not a crime, it's a reality of every little human action. I am not going into your personal space, just stay away from me. You can try to bring me to court, have a positive test result for me and still not be able to prove I gave it to you, which wouldn't be a crime anyway. Their logic hurts my brain. It defies hundreds of years of basic logic that children could understand.</p>

        <p>I make a similar argument all the time. What we're doing is akin to banning driving until we can guarantee driving deaths are a thing of the past or under an arbitrary number like "20 per year". It's completely asinine. </p>
<p>Everytime you get in the driver's seat you can kill a large number of people, even young children and babies. Surely we gotta figure this out because "people are dying! It's an epidemic!".</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you. One thing about HIV though (and correct me if I am wrong), is that unlike a respiratory virus like rona, you really aren’t going to show symptoms or know that you are sick for quite some time, sometimes years, right?  So if you think you might have had sex with someone who is HIV+, it’s a good idea to wear a condom even if you haven’t been tested? 
HIV spreads person to person because of actual VERY close intentional physical contact and exchange of bodily fluids, not little bits of spit maybe wisping through the air. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you have the rona (or more likely tested positive for it) because it’s a respiratory virus, the likelihood of spreading it to other people if you don’t have symptoms (aka if you’re not sick) is so low. I mean, despite what people want to believe, those without symptoms are NOT spreading it by simply existing or sometimes opening their mouths. Over and over it’s been said that “asymptomatic spread” is not likely, yet it is the entire reason for the Great Muzzling of 2020. </p>
<p>The thing that gets me about all this is: when I go to the store, I’m usually alone and I go in, I get my stuff, maybe wander a little, check out, and leave. Let’s say I really did test positive and I have virus in my respiratory tract. </p>
<p>Well, for one, I’m not going to go to the store if I feel like shit. </p>
<p>For two, if I don’t have symptoms and I don’t feel like shit, and I go to the store, I’m not going to be coughing all over the place, I’m not licking doorknobs or fruit, and I’m also not ever running around yelling or even talking, really not even opening my mouth ever except maybe to say a little “how’s it going” to the cashier. And even then, I’m probably not even going to see a cashier because I like the self checkout line because it’s usually lots faster! </p>
<p>So what’s the point of covering my mouth if my mouth is going to stay shut the whole time anyway? </p>
<p>And in the off chance I sneeze, I’m not gross and when I sneeze, I don’t slobber openly all over the place. I’m a polite person who was taught manners, much like most of the rest of people? It’s so stupid, all of it.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s the point. They say “you could.” It’s not “you are infected.” It’s “you might be infected.”</p>

<p>You might get in a car wreck! Should I take your license because you <em>might</em> kill someone in a wreck?</p>
<p>The guessing game is the problem. I’m not saying people shouldn’t wear masks if they know they’re infected, in fact I think that’s probably a good thing to do. But if you’re healthy, our social norms have never been to mask up.</p>

        <p>Great read and I agree with pretty much everything.</p>
<p>I would, however like to address the COVID being dangerous at all. It's dangerous to those who are At risk, like a pneumonia would be. I believe these people should be protected, but not at the expense of far more who will become a victim to the collateral damage of measures.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to make is regarding masks. This is going to sound a bit weird when i say it but I would rather contract COVID or any other Flu through someone coughing or sneezing on me..Gross, yes lol, but here's the basic science. Our respiratory tract is comprised of two sections, the upper, and the lower. You may over your life heard that the last thing you want to happen is have a virus get into your lower tract, simply becasue this is what will cause fluid build up and respiratory distress. Our upper tract is the equivalent of our first line of defense you know those pesky head colds that generate all that mucous leaking from every facial orifice lol..Virus's come in both large and small particles, the large particles vehicle is the droplets you hear about spraying everywhere when someone coughs...But when exposed these larger particles are far less likely to get past your upper respiratory tract and will settle in there, either getting expelled again or infecting a local cell. This is like an early warning alarm. The cell becomes infected and triggers the immune system response and before the virus can replicate into the lower tract it is vanquished. BUT...small particles, although less infectious becasue they carry a smaller viral load, still have a higher probability of reaching the lower tract uninhibited and unrecognized. Therefore, is it does infect a host cell in this tract, it begins replication and could cause serious problems before the immune system can respond effectively. The problem is and the argument they are asserting is that masks trap and  / or reduce the spread of these large particles, which is true to some degree, however the small particles get expelled regardless with only minor stoppage and these particles are circulating. This could mean effectually that people's chance of first infection being in the lower tract is increased.. So from my perspective I would rather get the head cold than the chest infection any day of the week. Just something to consider and perhaps research on your own to draw your own conclusions.</p>

<p>no really though. Someone made a post here the other day I think about some interesting parallels between Mary Mallon’s story and the current pandemic. Mary Mallon was born with the disease that causes typhoid fever. She didn’t go around intentionally infecting people, she was just living her life and working until she was forcibly quarantined. By doomer logic she should have been wearing a mask since she was born. She didn’t know she was getting others sick but they demonized her then like they do now. Just like they do to lockdown skeptics and anti-maskers.</p>

        <p>I really don't think any of this matters. You're absolutely right but you're not going to convince anyone who doesn't already agree with your thinking. I personally don't even think masks help at all but to each their own. The thing is we have to wear them to slow the spread so we don't overwhelm the hospitals to give time for a vaccine. That's the mainstream narrative anyways. Once the vaccine is out I doubt they will let us take off the masks and I'm under the impression we will go into more stricter measures. There's just too many people afraid of a .4% chance of dying.</p>

        <p>I still don't understand this "logic". 
I have a small pastry shop and since i've got bad asthma, masks are impossible for me to breath in so I don't use one (aside of the asthma I'm really healthy, take care of my body and have a good immune system) I explain it to my customers and since they know me a lot of them understand.
 But once I had a woman who sat there, ordered and started to eat when after 15 minutes she started yelling "WHY DON'T YOU WEAR A MASK?!!" , so I explained her and she told me "you are putting my life and the life of my baby (she was with her 1 year old kid) in danger!!! I'll call the police and tell everyone not to come here". 
People are changing sides when they encounter me in the streets, or put their masks back on. 
I honestly don't want to live in this society anymore, we really need to take actions or this will be going on for years and years ...</p>

        <p>I agree that it’s a hyperbole statement, but disagree that it’s false logic.</p>
<p>I would say during a pandemic, not wearing a mask increase the chance of spreading the infection. There’s a possibility that you could be infected with asymptomatic symptoms. So with that logical, you could be endangering someone life unknowingly by not wearing a mask. Probably a low chance of endangerment but it’s still there.</p>
<p>For the people actually worried about being killed by the virus by being in public area. Well, if I were them I’d try to avoid people like my life depended on it.</p>

        <p>So your argument would be correct with a disease that showed symptoms prior to making the person contagious to others. </p>
<p>The challenge with Covid is that it’s not deadly enough. A lot of people either have no symptoms or mild symptoms, and don’t ever think of themselves as potentially contagious. This is why you should consider yourself contagious when around others - because you simply don’t know one way or the other. </p>
<p>Your argument basically says “I should be able to do whatever I want, and others around me just have to deal with it”. If you’re self-centered enough to believe this, I am thankful that you are not a part of my life, but I pity those you interact with on a general basis. Hopefully the holidays will warm up your heart.</p>

        <p>Ah so i guess you, being the virtuous saint that you are, considered yourself contagious with the flu during every flu season in your life while you checked out in the grocery store next to old ladies? I mean the flu kills 10s of thousands each year, and 50% of cases are spread asymptomatically, so clearly your excellency took the proper precautions, right? You wore a mask? You social distanced? You <em>obviously</em> considered yourself contagious! Right? You wouldn’t be a fucking hypocrite, now would you?</p>
<p>“Not knowing” if something is harmful is not a good reason to issue government mandated or even socially mandated behavioral changes. I don’t know if the lady in the Burka at Food Lion is a terrorist or not, let’s make her remove her Burka so we can ID her! I don’t know if some guy walking down the street has a gun in his pocket. Let’s make him empty his pockets!</p>
<p>See, your argument is people are guilty until proven innocent, when the reverse is true. If YOU want to be overly careful, that’s on you, you can stay home and sequester yourself. But when you project your fear of the unknown onto other people and strip them of rights to cover their face or not, it is wrong, because ultimately you just don’t know. Doing nothing to infringe liberties in the face of the unknown is better than removing liberty in the same case. </p>
<p>And you’ve completely strawmanned my argument. That’s NOT at all what it says. Perhaps you lost the meaning as your slaves read you the text, your excellency.</p>

        <p>People don't know whether they are infected, and the biggest spreaders have been people who feel completely fine, in other words asymptomatic or presymptomatic people.  By not wearing a mask, you may well be endangering others if you have c19 and haven't had any symptoms.  You would have no way of knowing, and neither would anyone else, and thats why it is a safe bet to wear the mask.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, no one would have to say anything ever, and if I see someone without a mask, I just avoid them.  In an ideal world however, there would be no one who wouldn't put a piece of cloth on thier face to reduce risk to thier neighbors and countrymen.  </p>
<p>Its easy, and effective. I can't understand the logic behind not wearing one.</p>

        <p>Death by auto made up about 37,000 deaths last year.</p>
<p>You're talking about a virus that kills 2% of the people that get it (based on global numbers).  If 10,000 of us were lined up, and there was a dude with a rifle who said he was going to shoot 50 of us but there would only be 1 fatality assuming that no one picked up the free bulletproof vest and helmet made available to everyone.  Would you pick up the gear?  Or not?  Would you want loved ones to pick up the gear? Or not? I mean, what if he shoots you in the face? Is it even worth it?</p>
<p>The fear of the virus doesn't have to be hysteria.  Its more like the fear that your opponent in a game will beat you, so you mount strategies to prevent that.  You now have a much better chance of winning. 
  Masks are a preventative strategy to ward off the results of a disease that about 3/4% of people on earth have experience, that has a 2% chance of killing you.<br>
The odds are in favor of you making it.  You still might not, but you reduce the small chance that you do dramatically by wearing a mask, and by teaching your children to, and encouraging others to.  </p>
<p>Its a survival strategy.</p>
<p>In a car, we stop at red lights, we signal when we change lanes, we wear safetly belts and depend on airbags.  Sometimes we don't do those things, and we're fine.  Sometimes, you or someone else doesn't,  and thats when tragedy steps in.</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of a virus, we wash our hands, we socially distance, we wear masks.  Some people don't,  and are okay, some people do and are not, but the majority of people who follow the rules are safer than those that don't. </p>
<p>Also, the science benind masks is pretty interesting.  Did you know that on N95 masks they charge the filaments with electricity, and that is what causes particles as small as viruses to attach to the fabric and not pass through?  That's no guess, that's observable!</p>
<p>The other masks do about the same thing as covering your mouth when you cough.  Its not really preventing you from getting a disease by itself, but if everyone were wearing them it would decimate the supply of virus in the air.<br>
Less virus=less infection</p>

        <p>My normal response to a two month old article who hasn't even been peer reviewed is to take it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>But since you linked it, I actually read it and here's what the authors claim in the discussion:</p>
<p>&rt; Asymptomatic patients may therefore be contagious but for a shorter duration, limiting the duration they could transmit to their contacts. However, there remain limited data on the shedding  of  infectious  virus  in  asymptomatic  individuals  to  quantify  their  transmission potential (...).</p>
<p>&rt; The  modelling  studies  suggest  that  it  isn’t  possible  to  have  epidemics  of  this  size  without substantial  pre-symptomatic  transmission.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>&rt; In settings such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, cruise ships and meat-packing plants in which many people spend prolong period of time together in the same  environment including sleeping, dining and sharing  common  facilities, and where several outbreaks have been documented,   pre-symptomatic transmission may contribute substantially to transmission.</p>

        <p>The pre-symptomatic phase is defined as the 1-2 days before symptoms where there is enough viral load for transmission*. Asymptomatic transmission is rare, which 9 studies finding occurrence of 0%-2.8% (the above literature review). Pre-symptomatic secondary attack rates were as high as 30%. </p>
