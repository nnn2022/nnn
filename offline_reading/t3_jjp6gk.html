    <strong>The hipocrisy of Latin American elites.</strong>
    <p><p>One thing that creates support for lockdowns in Latin America is that, for the educated elite that makes decisions, being a locked down Latin American is an easy life. </p>
<p>It would be very easy for me to be a hypocrite and put #fiqueemcasa on my facebook like most of my friends in real life. I am one of the very few skepticals that I know.</p>
<p>For everyone else, unemployment is rampant and things are breaking apart, but not for us.     </p>
<p>Not only I can get anything that I want on my fingertips that I can afford (like steak and pinot noir), but also know, as a Latin American, that is easy to cheat the system and have an 80% normal life.</p>
<p>Example: want a haircut? The hairdressers had doors closed, but they have the whatsapp number on the door. You call and, in 15 minutes, they open the door for you.</p>
<p>Want a drink? Get at a gas station and sit on the sidewalk in front. Police doesnÂ´t give a damn. </p>
<p>Gyms closed? After May, you could get a personal trainer.</p>
<p>Speakeasy? The guy who delivered drinks for me opened the bar after getting to know me.</p>
<p>If you work at an office and not a company that has a public front open at all times (shops and drestaurants), no one bats an eye. A lawyer or accountant can go to the office in person or speak with clients on zoom.</p></p>
