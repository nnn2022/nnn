    <strong>Master Plan Theory Discussion: Globalist Push for NWO via Social Manipulation and Digital Lifestyles</strong>
    <p><p>tl/dr: Capitalism requires infinite growth which is a problem on a finite planet. Solution = incentivizing non-physical digital assets via forcing people into digital spaces via mass psychological manipulation, economic dis-empowerment etc.</p>
<p>The following is a postulation of a theory. I hope to receive feedback and hear other theories as well as any potential solutions. I understand that real solutions are significantly complicated. I may attempt formulating one in the future. This short essay simply details my observations on the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>This theory is premised around what appears to be "globalists" attempt at finding a solution for the issue of capitalism requiring infinite growth. Our mostly capitalistic global economy cannot continue to function in a sustainable manner as resources on our planet are not endless. This past year we have been forced inside due to the threat of a dubious boogieman. Without many real world human interactions, many of us have become very much immersed in the "digital world". Things like BTC, which I generally like the basic idea of, but which doesn't exactly have much physically tangible value (like an affiliation with a government or something of the sort), are becoming more and more popular and accepted. Now with all the talk about NFTs and people buying digital plots of land in video games for hundreds of thousands of "real" dollars, paying real money for items in video games, etc. it occurred to me that this may be the goal. It seems that the master plan may be to get everyone so afraid to interact in the physical world that these "digital assets" become more and more accepted and sought after. At the same time taking away peoples livelihoods and making them dependent on the "American Rescue Plan Act" and other monetary schemes. (Which involve printing paper and seemingly endless debt.) A primary function of money is to incentivize work, and if you can incentivize people to work for something that isn't even real (which is already the case due to the manipulable nature of fiat currency), then you can continue to get their labor, for essentially nothing. All this while culling pollution, violence, societal uncertainty, potential uprisings etc. (These being the benevolent goals of the globalists. At the sake of many of our "freedoms" of course.)</p>
<p>Many of the changes that have been happening in recent years have achieved a consolidation of power. Additionally we have seen many divide and conquer tactics successfully employed to make citizens not trust their neighbors or anyone else for that matter. (Two-party politics, "terrorism", BLM, ID politics, and of course Covid, etc). These appear to be distractions to ensure the populace is unable to organize to potentially overthrow a corrupt government. The issue I find with the globalists apparent agenda is that it gives all of the power to the people with the most money and resources instead of a creation of a global system where all groups of people have fair representation and that decisions are made by the most intellectually able voting democratically for the sake of human and environmental well-being. This is the ideal of how the USA may have functioned, to a degree, briefly. This is clearly not the case anymore.</p>
<p>Who is running the show? The Federal Reserve, central banks, IMF, World Bank and their beneficiaries are highly suspect. It seems like governments globally have been undermined over the course of, well, all of history to a point where this "pandemic" can happen and it appears that nearly the entire world fell in line immediately. We have all heard of the NWO and are aware, at least in part, of the many different entities which appear to be operating to further these goals (CDC, World Economic Forum, etc etc). Furthermore, I am sure many of you have noticed that essentially all social media sites, and Google, have been heavily involved in censoring a variety of topics. It is suspect that they have all acted in such a synchronized manner. Additionally it seems that the search results come up with less and less information outside of mainstream news sources. It is clear that much information is being censored.</p>
<p>Many of us are aware the world mostly operates as it always has; instead of cavemen with clubs it has been large groups of people represented by some form of government with nukes/Kalashnikovs. However, it seems something in the typical power dynamics is now shifting. I believe this has to do with the creation of tangible value. For example as we all know most manufacturing has been moved out of the United States/&amp; "western nations". Slavery was not abolished, only outsourced and obscured by economic enticements. People in the USA have slowly seen their wages cut and job opportunities dry up. There is some saying about it being the way to boil a frog: by slowly turning up the heat so it doesn't notice until it is too late. And why would this happen? The answer seems clear: because there is no need to incentivize people in the USA/other nations which have given up tangible value producing industries because hardly anybody has a job that creates something with tangible value. (Things like mining, manufacturing, farming, etc.)</p>
<p>It appears that there are competing "superpowers" (USA, Russia, China). However it seems that even these competing powers may be a facade; that the central banking systems have undermined all of these governments/economies, as well as the rest of the world. (It seems like N. Korea may be an actual wildcard, but then again I am skeptical here also. Additionally it does not appear N. Korea is anywhere near a model for an ideal society.)</p>
<p>In spite of the lock-downs I am grateful that the events in recent history have allowed some of us to attain greater clarity on the state of the world than our ancestors. Finding this group on Reddit has been a relief as I can clearly see I am very much not alone in my sentiments. The "pandemic" made it obvious who will simply fall in line and who is brave/intelligent/fortunate enough to question the narrative.</p>
<p>So what can a person do? Yes, I know, use a local credit union, exercise, eat healthy, try cutting bad habits, meditate &amp; pray, be kind, admit when you're wrong, shop local etc. However these things may not incite a "global awakening of peace and love". Remember the 60's? (Though they might, and it is still advisable to do the aforementioned things.) We can do all of these things and the "powers that be" may still slowly be worming their way into our lives: making us wear masks while we pray/meditate, live in crowded apartments buildings and unable to afford food that wasn't doused in pesticides/hormones, controlling our access to information Etc. Etc. So what can a person really do? The answer may be do nothing. The answer may be to find joy and goodness in spite of it all. To have faith in this miraculous life and try to be a good person, regardless of the outside world, to still communicate honestly, to strive for truth.</p>
<p>I will continue to try my best at enacting the above virtues in spite of what happens. However in the meantime, before what appears to be the impending NWO takeover, I am looking for some more tangible things that I can do that I haven't thought of yet. Things that I could do to position myself to live the rest of my life in the best way and in the best environment possible. I know a lot of people are moving to Texas and Florida because the governors have ended the lock-downs and mask mandates in spite of the federal governments wishes. Sweden is interesting as it seems that they didn't enact lock-downs like much of the rest of the world. Do you know of any places one could network with others in physical (&amp; digital) spaces to help build sustainable and virtue oriented communities? Are there other places that have resisted the globalist agenda in any relevant way? Do you know of any organizations that I might look into that I could possibly network with? Are there any organizations which have a mission to enact meaningful and benevolent change?</p>
<p>Saying all of this, to reiterate, these are just theories. I am trying my best to make sense of the world with the tools at my disposal. I know that no matter what happens we can live with dignity as long as we stand for the good in this world and beyond. Thank you for your time and for any thoughts or critiques you wish to offer.</p></p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong>: <em>novacula Occami</em> or <em>lex parsimoniae</em>, from Latin, meaning the simplest solution is <em>usually</em> the correct one.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong>: There is approx. US $37 trillion in circulation (liquid), and a further US $1.2 quadrillion in non-liquid assets as of 2021: <a href="https://www.rankred.com/how-much-money-is-there-in-the-world/">source</a>.  As the worldwide population increases (both developing and developed) - currently 7.86 billion people (<a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">source</a>), the share of the wealthy gets eroded, as they have to share it (via wages, taxes, etc.) whether they want to or not.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong>: A collapse in the free market trade combined with a disaster (whether natural or man-made), resulting in vast loss of life would reduce or stop the hemorrhage from the wealthy.  Bonus, with fewer people around, less likely to revolt, complain, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: WW2.  Destroyed markets, millions lost their lives and the wealthy became even wealthier.  In the absence of armed conflict, due to the armament of most societies, a pandemic, is the next best thing.  </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The answer to your query can be answered with one word: GREED.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your response. For some reason I didn't see it initially. Maybe since I'm a bit new to posting on Reddit.</p>
<p>I like what you said about simplicity. I suppose you have heard of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor">Occam's razor</a>?</p>
<p>Also thanks for bringing up human nature. Greed is one of those base instincts; based in fear. I wonder if humanity as a whole will transcend that impulse? It appears certain individuals have freed themselves from its sway.</p>

        <p>I do not believe greed is an instinct.  It is often confused with self-preservation, but those are not the same.  Self-preservation motivates you to stay alive; greed is usually  done at the expense of others.</p>
<p>The easiest way to absolve yourself of greed is to visit a cemetery.  No matter, how tall, fat, beautiful, smart, or rich one is, we all end up in the same place: dead.  Sure, we can chose what happens to our bodies, but the end result is the same.  Death is inevitable.</p>
<p>Once you realize that, you realize how pointless and stupid greed truly is and yet, how still so many are blinded by it.</p>
