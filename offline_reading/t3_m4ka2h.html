    <strong>Holocaust and Covid</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/events-in-the-history-of-the-holocaust-1933-to-1939/">https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/events-in-the-history-of-the-holocaust-1933-to-1939/</a></p>
<p>I recommend looking into this article and other organizations dedicated to explaining what happened during the Holocaust and how it happened.</p>
<p>Now that you're back from that informative article (and hopefully doing other research), I want you to take a good look into how the experiences of Jews and the experiences of anti-maskers are similar. Laws were passed and enforced that took the rights of the Jews away. During the Holocaust, Jews were forced from their homes into ghettos where the conditions were abhorrent. First, the elderly were taken to extermination camps, and then their children were taken next. All Jews had their belongings stolen by the Nazis who wished to use them for their selfish desires. Next, they were forced to relocate where they traveled 200 per cattle car where only a few dozen cattle stayed. They were sent to Auschwitz where those who could work were given clothes that did not fit. Those unfit to work were sent to the gas chambers. People's arms were pulled out of their sockets from where they tried to escape, but no escape would be found. The undesirables who were deemed to work had to do so in freezing conditions and were starving. When the laborers became too exhausted to work, they too were sent to the chambers.</p>
<p>No to the modern-day and Covid-19. People are asked to wear a mask and receive the new vaccines that are coming out. How is this similar to the atrocities those deemed unlovely by the Nazis experienced during the Holocaust, you may ask? They are not similar at all. People are asked to take precautions, not to control the populace for the coming of the anti-Christ, but to protect their fellow humans. Wearing a mask does little to protect yourself from others, but instead protects others from illnesses you may carry. Vaccines are only effective when everybody receives one, so everybody is asked to receive one to hopefully end this as soon as possible. Try not to gather in large groups, so that you do not spread the virus anymore. The Holocaust and governments asking you to protect your fellow man have nothing alike. If you do have an example of similarities between the two, please do enlighten me. If not, take a good look into how you act.</p>

        <p>Interesting, I didn't know that I am virtue signaling. I have done everything in my power during this pandemic. I haven't see my friends for more than a year now. I only go out in public when absolutely necessary. I am not virtue signaling, you don't know what that is. Virtue signaling is like the celebrities who say they understand how everyone is feeling during all this, but still live their lives like there is no global pandemic</p>

<p>I'm not trying to say that I'm some perfect person or that you need to follow my lead. I'm simply trying to explain to everyone that what this subreddit believes in is morally wrong. You would rather someone die in a hospital alone, while their lungs no longer work because a virus ravaged them, then give up your "right" to not have to wear a mask. Nice try, you have no real, educated response to my post, so you are trying to call-out what I'm doing</p>

<p>Though, I think we are. I’m preparing for the worst. The energy is so powerful lately. I feel it in my bones. Things are going to get ugly for us non vaccine people. </p>
<p>I’m certain we’ll be viewed the same way the west viewed the muslims in the early 2000s. Question is, where will that take us? How bad do they hate free people? </p>

        <p>Lockdown (in America at least): happened when it first reached American soil because we didn't know much about the virus, and wanted to reduce the number of cases. If lockdowns happen locally it's because people aren't doing anything to stop the spread, and something had to happen immediately</p>
<p>Masks: to protect people from your germs. Honestly, masks should be worn if you're sick with anything, even when this pandemic is over.</p>
<p>Not allowed to protest: the police aren't stopping anti-mask or anti-lockdown protests. Compared to BLM protests which were met with police who were using riot equipment and pepper spray. The Department of Homeland Security even picked people off the streets when they were exercising their right to protest during the BLM protests. If you're talking about the Capitol riot, those involved were trespassing on government property and damaged the building. Some even went in with the intent to harm some senators and even Pence. </p>
<p>Freedom of speech: social media platforms won't ban you unless you use hate speech, and even then, nothing will happen unless you are big. Trump was banned because he incited violence, and spread misinformation since the beginning of his presidency. In addition, freedom of speech only applies to the government preventing you from expressing your opinion, not privately owned businesses and corporations.</p>

        <p>Nothing HAD to happen. Since the pandemic is a media crusade. Take away the media, the narrative, the fear and the fake reality and what do you have? A typical year with a bad flu season. We’ve had many of them before. Nobody batted an eye. </p>
<p>You only care now because you’re told to. You’re a conformist. An ideological apologist. I mean that with respect. </p>
<p>You can debate about masks all you want. It’s silly. Masks for what? A fake pandemic? It’s like wearing a helmet when you drive your car. </p>
<p>With regards to your BLM/anti mask paragraph. That’s fake news. You can not protest masks, lockdowns or PCR tests when BLM protests happen daily. What this means is the ideology is suppressing voices and promoting others. BLM riots are burning private business. There was gun battles in the streets in Illinois. The Capitol “riot” was harmless. Trespassing on government property? You kidding me? What about Habib Muhammad’s gas station burning in a BLM protest? Have you ever seen violence with an anti mask protestor? It’s just a bunch of hippies. </p>
<p>The president of the USA was banned for no reason. If you think he did anything wrong you are brainwashed. Trump was never found guilty. Because he is not guilty. People with much less emotional/identity issues than trump hating net trolls looked at the evidence and voted to not impeach. </p>
<p>What more do you want. Your type of people see only the story that MSM sells. That’s the truth. The rest of us don’t care about your weird ideology campaign you’re taking part in. Worship your government if you like. But you’re just their tool for now. Then they’ll turn on you.</p>

        <p>What? You all really thought it was a coincidence that the doomers kept calling us "plague rats?" "Disgusting?" "Diseased?" That we need to be "dealt with" for everyone's own "safety?"</p>
<p>And some people got so offended when I compared it to the leadup to...basically every genocide ever.</p>

        <p>I do not equate Nazi Germany to the pandemic, because the current context gives the appearance of being characterized entirely by public health and deaths from illness. But this does not adequately describe the fullness of the situation, or justify any and all violation of human rights just because of the word of reddit heroes, corrupt government scientists or institutions. The positions that have been taken are wrong, as is the way they have been pushed by governments and their masked minions.</p>
<p>And there <strong>are</strong> <strong><em>some</em></strong> similarities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nazi: Jews were forced to take experimental vaccines</li>
<li>
<p>Covid: healthy people are coerced into taking experimental vaccines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nazi: Jews were segregated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid: unvaccinated (Jews) are segregated </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nazi: enforced censorship, book burnings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid: big tech enforced censorship, scientific articles retracted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nazi: indoctrination to blame Jews</p>
</li>
<li>Covid: indoctrination to blame dissenters</li>
</ul>
