        <p>This year I lost everything.  My business and my wife.  </p>
<p>I had a 15 year business that we ran together.  After we were forced to close it felt like we were watching our baby die.  I understand what people mean when they say couples who break up after the death of a child.</p>
<p>The industry in which I worked for the past 15, in which I am an expert and have spent most of my life training for, is now destroyed.  </p>
<p>So basically I find myself a young adult, freshly divorced, and I'll have to start everything all over again.</p>
<p>Now, all of this sounds bad.  And it has been hard, but in a weird way it has also been an opportunity.</p>
<p>I'm doing new things now, and actually, this is kind of exciting.</p>
<p>There is something interesting to be said about losing everything, and starting at zero.  In crisis there is opportunity.</p>
<p>So personally, despite having lost everything, this year has been okay.  </p>
<p>My complaint stems from my worry about the rest of the world.  It is simply shameful half the world decided to destroy the other half.</p>

        <p>My mental health has been severely impacted by this, as well as the relationship with my father. Back in April I probably would have killed myself if it wasn't for my boyfriend. I was forced to be in a house with people who did not respect me or the needs of my condition, and every day was a living hell. I used to be able to go out to the grocery store or something at least once a week to feel normal. It's been almost 1 year since I went in to public. Not because I'm scared of the virus, but because I can't deal with having my movement restricted by these bullshit rules and the possibility of some Karen trying to get her Facebook likes for the day. Not to mention my sensory issues make wearing a mask pretty much impossible without a major spike in my mental distress, but I guess I'm just a stupid selfish Covid denier for that.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that good to hear you are staying positive. I also lost my business in the us. I had a grappling gym that was my dream to start for 15 years and after 2 years plus of running was finally making money! ðŸ˜‚ then March came and covid shut me down!</p>

        <p>I wasn't able to finish school on time. Stage is cancelled so it's easier but I want to do stage, so I'll wait. I got a really good job during the pandemic in place of school, met some cool people. 
Lost my best friend to suicide and not being able to go to the funeral because 10 people only but i didn't know until 7 months later when I asked around wondering why she was afk.
My boyfriend is at home all the time and I don't have personal space.
Sometimes my well being suffers every time there are new changes from the government.</p>

        <p>I have PTSD which started with the first Lockdown. At first I thought I was just traumatised by how fast everything changed so quickly and drastically. I lost my job in May and have since lost my friends (my social circle was wiped out when I couldn't volunteer anymore. I, being single, drifted away from everyone who had families to take care of and worries of their own). I found a counsellor when I got so low I planned for suicide. It turns out I have PTSD.  From sexual abuse. </p>
<p>Wearing a mask is not an option and seeing them everywhere terrifies me. I'm now afraid to even look outside. I don't look at media if I can help it so I'm not triggered. If I do go into a shop, it feels like running a gauntlet, trying not to look at anyone and hoping no one confronts me. My hands shake uncontrollably so I hold on to a cart for some sense of stability. It's truly hellish.</p>
<p>I'm essentially trapped in my home, alone. Traumatised. Suicidal. Grieving for a Normal that's not coming back.</p>
