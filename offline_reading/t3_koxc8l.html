        <p>I've been thinking  also if this is why influenza have disappeared this year. I work in a covid lab in Finland,  I analyze the POC PCR Covid samples. We recently started using combo kits that detects Covid and also Influenza A &amp; B and RSV.  </p>
<p>We have been using these combo kits for few days now and so far none of the Covid positive samples was also detected positive for influenza A or B or RSV. I also believe that there is something fishy going on with disappeared flu but so far I haven't noticed any positive flu cases with patients having positive covid.</p>

        <p>Actually very good to know.  Perhaps there is a competing effect between COVID and the flu.  </p>

        <p>Been floating this theory by my nurse friend.</p>
<p>If you simply rename Influenza to Covid and report on daily death statistics + cases like it's the end of the world, the average person has no idea how many people actually die each year from the flu and would completely shit their pants.</p>
<p>Normies would go into a mass panic and anyone trying to bring things back to reality would just be drowned out by the sheer volume of normies freaking out.</p>
<p>In some ways it's a lot like Kony2012 on steroids.</p>

        <p>It's common for people I know to say "I had a bit of the flu" or something similar. Every annoying cold and sniffle is assumed to be the flu. In reality, the flu is very virulent and usually beats the shit out of people of all ages. I suspect that a lot of people ascribe flu symptoms to covid because they don't believe the flu is an intense illness.</p>

        <p>I was reading a while back that it is not really well understood if flu spreads asymptomaticly or not. </p>
<p>In my experience of getting flu the symptoms come on extremely rapidly and as you said knock you out and make you bedridden for 3-5  days before you start to recover. Only the most stubborn of people would stumble to work in that condition.  I suspect a lot of the transmission of flu happens when you are just about able to still stand and walk around and might spread it to a few people at work or your friends/family before you go home sick.  </p>
<p>Now with everyone being paranoid about Covid there is less of a stigma about taking sick leave and a lot of people are still WFH and offices open at reduced capacity.  </p>
<p>Covid seems to be a different beast though but it would be ironic if we manage to get rid of Influenza which has been a big killer for centuries accidentally whilst failing to get rid of Covid.</p>

        <p>Most likely explanation is that coronovirus spreads very easily in confined places, like homes. The people who are likely to catch flu are likely to catch coronovirus instead. It's why coronovirus is spreading during lock-down. It's also why lock-downs are pointless.</p>
<p>Masks only work if they are N95 spec and if you are spending more than 15 mins in arms reach of each someone with symptoms of coronovirus.</p>

        <p>The reason why the flu is down this year is because since the flu is a seasonal disease, it was pretty much nicked in the bud because of the prevalence of mask wearing and social distancing, while covid was already being spread through the community for months. People also have more immunity to the flu from past infections and vaccines, while covid is completely novel to people's immune systems and there is no significant amount of vaccinations for it yet.</p>

        <p>You're a fool if you don't think lockdowns, distancing, masks, and much more diligent washing of hands and surfaces won't lead to a decrease in the flu. Come on.</p>

        <p>Of course it’s going to decrease it. But it’s been pretty much eradicated from the world, while, according to people like you, the covid is still ravaging the planet killing grandmothers left and right. Just think about your logic. There’s no way we have just done away with the flu</p>

        <p>But thats not the issue. The issue is the rona number being padded. Died of rona after crashing his motorcycle is a great example. </p>
<p>The article literally says the Rona count is being supported by flu cases.</p>

        <p>No, there is absolutely no evidence to support that. You can't say masks and social distancing work while the main argument that we're still here is because people aren't wearin masks and distancing. </p>
<p>The CARES act gave hospitals some incentive to label COVID cases, around $40k worth. So if I have a flu patient with the same symptoms, you bet your ass that's labeled COVID. Motorcycle crash with a cough? COVID for sure. It's corruption in plain sight and it's affecting so much more than it helped.</p>

<p>Also the flu doesn’t work like that. Like other commenters pointed out, the flu mutates and that’s why there’s a new strain and new vaccine every year.</p>

        <p>By your logic, wearing masks would never be helpful because if covid is spreading they're not working and if covid isn't spreading then masks are not necessary. 
In reality they are very effective in slowing transmission of the disease but it's not a magic bullet to completely stop the virus.</p>

        <p>I disagree. If you look at states with strict mask mandates like California and New York, their positivity rate is much higher</p>
<p>https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days</p>
<p>That aside, I do agree with the sentiment that proper facial covering can help in disease transmission, but it needs to be an n95 mask that is fitted to the persons face. The weave of the conventional masks you see out and about Do not do anything because the droplets containing the virus are on the order of microns in diameter.</p>

        <p>Surgical masks do help:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7301882/</p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong> new articles suggest mask wearers forego social distancing, or are more lax about their protective measures giving a false sense of security. Measures only work when used in tandem, and even then aren’t perfect, just reduced risk. It’s a problem as wearing a surgical mask doesn’t really protect you, just limit your potential viral spread if you’re asymptomatic at the time (early infection or true asymptomatic). </p>
<p>As to why the flu isn’t an issue this year is 80% travel related. Modelling prior suggests 90% of all seasonal USA flu transmissions come from Mexico &rt; LAX travel. This pairs in with large travel events (UK holiday, American Thanksgiving, NA holiday, pilgrimage to Mecca, Olympics, etc.) being large spreaders of the flu. </p>
<p>Limited air travel has decimated this tropical reservoir movement to seasonal areas. This results in far fewer mutations, due to fewer vectors, and limiting cross-infection/reinfection to seasonal reservoirs. Pair this with current health precautions, and significantly reduced socialization, and the flu virus this year is decimated. </p>
<p>If this theory has legs, we should see less flu cases over the next few years (~3-4 I would guess) unless there’s a zootropic variant like swine or avian than jumps hosts. </p>
<p>I do believe masks, hand hygiene, and social distancing have reduced respiratory infections within our population. I also expect once orders are lifted there will be a huge uptick in acute diseases, of non-COVID origin, due to decreased vitamin D from being indoors, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, alcohol consumption, and other factors that decrease your immune system.</p>

        <p>The video is in some places pretty similar as in norway. I know USA news has completely fkt up and polarised everything about covid, but there are actually some measures which are strict while some have pretty mild compared to the USA. E.g. masks mandates are pretty localised whether there is an outbreak or not. Close contact is a definition where you been close to somebody, e.g. in the same room or under 1 m for about 15 minutes. Close contacts are defined as being high risk of spread if the one has corona during or 2 days before symptoms. Generally reduce the amount of people who you have contact with to reduce the spread if there is any, also makes it easier to put people in quarantine(only in norway).most of these measures are in place in Sweden and in norway. That does not mean you can't go to the store without mask in most places, not unless there is an local outbreak. Even though its not a full lockdown, they do have a severe effect on reducing spread without shutting down the country completely. Masks is the weakest of all the measures so I don't know why its even mentioned, but Sweden do have measures, just not as strict as lost other countries, why wouldn't that affect the flu as well, its perfectly logical since its an airborne viral disease same as covid.</p>

        <p>They have very few measures.  You see no social distancing, people on trains tightly packed without masks, etc.  What measures can counteract people on trains and shopping with no or little social distancing?  I think they lowered groups that can eat together down from 50 to 8 people.  Big deal</p>
<p>This is not even mentioning Brazil. Where if there are any restrictions at all most people ignore them. In India slums have no adherence.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the flu is near everywhere in the world and these measures are not followed in many places.</p>

<p>These are pretty strict, nordic countries just hasn't bandwagon the whole mask thing in USA since its one of the least effective measures. Just because people aren't wearing mask everywhere doesnt mean people arent working from home, or that social activities are cancelled. or that people aren't keeping their distance and disinfecting their hands everything they enter or exit a building, or that they reduce the amount of close contacts. This are thing they do in Sweden, just check the link.</p>

        <p>Right but they are riding trains!  What don't you get about thousands of people centimeters from each other on trains?</p>
<p>Also why is covid.being spread everywhere and the flu does not exist?</p>
<p>You still don't want to touch Brazil and other south American countries where no one adheres to anything yet the flu is gone there too.</p>

        <p>Since sweden mandate the measures, only recommends, I guess there can be an incident with a lot of people on a train, but in general people followed the guidelines since public transportations was reduced in Stockholm by 60%, I doubt the trains where packet all the time... ref https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301536.</p>
<p>corona is a novel virus and spreads faster than flu, reducing measures for viral diseases reducing an already relatively low influenza spread will obviously have an impact. in Sweden there was a study made on the flu where as soon as the measures where put in place, airplanes shutdown and schools closed, the flu numbers went down drastically while they still tested everybody for the flu which came in with symptoms for covid/flu.https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/publicerat-material/publikationsarkiv/i/influenza-in-sweden-2019-2020-season/?pub=80782</p>
<p>I haven't mentioned Brazil since I know more about sweden first hand since its my nabour country. Considering how off and misinformed  you were on sweden I'm not sure I'm gonna waste my looking into Brazil on the off chance you maybe did some proper research.</p>

        <p>Train use dropped 40-60% in Sweden.  That means at least 40% of train use was still happening. <br>
How does that make the flu go to almost 0?  A respiratory virus in a small place is easy to spread.  Those people catch it and take it home. </p>
<p>Of course you will know more about Sweden than me.  But your logic that flu has been stopped almost completely by the few measures taken and the few behavioral changes is flawed.</p>

        <p>Cause there was 0 measures, now there are many measures, public transportation being one of them. reducing the public transportation by half is not little, not sure why you are downplaying it.
Also IM not making the claim that flu almost disappeared. It almost dissappear because the data tells us that. You aren't making a point either actually, you are just saying its flawed. Why is it flawed? and what is wrong about the data? Is the data lying, did it lie before, if not, what changed?</p>

        <p>The data isn't flawed.  And a 50% drop in train use is huge.  But it still leaves 50%.  It doesn't make sense that a 50% drop means that the flu is nearly non existent.  It is still an easily transmissible disease.  Schools are still open. Shops and malls are open.  Restaurants are open. These are all places to breathe in a respiratory virus.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure why you think something as complicated as viral spread is perfectly linear with train usage, to do that is unsubstantiated speculation at best. It might be the case that flu cases drop almost to zero due to the global combined effort to reduce viral spread of covid. Also the fact that similar symptoms as covid, which means flu is also treated seriously just incase it covid. This has never happened before in human history so speculation is pointless, the only thing we can rest on is the data which we got. Also shops open, does not mean business as usual, I'm not sure why you leave out the fact that people do act very differently in shops, e.g. distancing, don't touch everything unless you buy it, disinfecting their hand, shop owner disinfecting the shopping carts. These things matter, and shops are open does not equal that things are the same as before.</p>

        <p>The problem is that it's not just the flu.  Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus have disappeared as well and they have the same R0 as COVID if not higher.  The other coronaviruses are gone as well.  Rhinovirus is still going strong however.</p>

<p>I don't think it has to do with measures.  Perhaps viral interference and misdiagnosis.</p>

        <p>I do not think anything is done wrong, but yeah it could be that there is some form of interference of course, excluding anything without looking into it is not good. I guess time will tell when the dust settles, we probably will learn a lot on viruses. Also a lot on immune response is to be learned, its  still a lot unknown around our immune system. It could also be partly sociological things influencing things, since we live in strange times, people behave differently.</p>
