    <strong>Insult Boris Johnson in Twitter = Instant Suspension.</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen all around twitter, every day almost, people wishing that some politician they dislike will die, and never having any problem with their accounts because of it. Also, in a legal sense, and in the wide society, insulting a public figure is seen as protected speech, while insulting a private figure doesn't always result in this, since context is everything, no to mention that a healthy democracy requires people being able to criticize freely politicians.</p>
<p>Well, I just did a 3 part tweet response on the latest Boris Johnson "Christmas is cancelled" tweet, talking how much of a shit politician he is, and how little he really cares about others, and only cares about himself, and ended with the frase "For the good of the world, I hope you die soon. ", and I got insta-suspended for, get this, "Abusive behavior", and it was automatic, because the instant I posted it the site stopped loading because I was already suspended.</p>
<p>Twitter is protecting some accounts, under who knows what standard, but you now have to watch how you criticize politicians in Twitter, because you can also get insta-suspended, and probably also insta-banned.</p></p>

        <p>But it is also because of the account it is directed at. Just making a quick search of those words, I could find hundreds of people using those words, many targeted toward politicians like Farage.</p>

        <p>Since it’s not a death threat (“I hope you die soon” is very different from “I’m going to kill you”), it would not be arrestable. Bro’s going to be fine, stop trying to spook him.</p>

        <p>You're missing the point.</p>
<p>First off it is protected under free speech, Twitter is a private company but just under the Idea of free speech.</p>
<p>Countries that have free speech don't police speech like that, Whereas countries where self-expression is limited they do such as Canada.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story. My friend once had a terrible gf the way she broke up with him as she called him while with another guy and had him gloat and having sed with her earlier this was in high school and on the phone so tempers flared and my buddy was saying shit like I hope you die etc all out of temper, not actual;ly meaning it but an argument.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>well since the school saw it they called the police and they had cops go to my friend's house and the minute he stepped off his private property to get his mother because they wanted to question him they cuffed him and held him for a day for uttering death threats...</p>
<p>I think that is absolutely ridiculous and further expressing why free speech is important and why i hate that it can be limited in Canad it could b something as little as "fighting words"</p>
<p>I would rather have a society like the US where free speech is protected, not this bullshit of well not if you say this or that that is a slippery slope.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/299"><strong>https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/299</strong></a></p>
<p>Looka t the oral argument 5:13 sec in Melville B. Nimmer when they talk about dissent vs violent dissent</p>
<p>I also suggest you look up cohen vs Califonia nonviolent dissent should never be limited and technically you can not be violent while just typing.... You can encourage violence but that's a whole nothing excuse people mostly LEos use to censor people...</p>
<p>But people like you don't understand when it comes to censorship if you give them an inch they take a mile, Im not even gonna argue about covid with you but anyways have a  nice night and don't take my rant personally!</p>

        <p>Technically what he said "I hope you die soon"</p>
<p>Now it all depends on how he follows this up as to whether it is actually a death threat if he said something like I hope you die soon I don't know when but we all go in our own time that would not be a threat legally speaking. ever watch American dad click next and watch 4 of these</p>

<p>You cant make a distinction about this being a death threat with just that little bit of context.</p>
<p>People like you will cling to things like well that's against Twitter TOs or well that's against subreddits rules. You are internet Jobsworth's that don't realize that most of these rules instate by private social media companies are akin to the security theatre that we have to deal with at airports you forget to put your phone in tat little thing for the Xray and go through he's gonna send you back and literally make you throw your phone into the thing before it goes into the x-ray in a busy airport why because he's a jobsworth and he feels good by enforcing arbitrary policy just like a lot of mods feel good when they censor something they don't agree with and like you feel good defending twitter in this scenario... </p>
<p>I find it staggering your mentality is while lets just all comply to their TOS and really believe its for our own good yeah case that shit worked so well with youtube right remember how great the site was when it started </p>
<p>Like I find it staggering that so many people cant see through bullshit if it is hidden behind logical fallacies such as well that the TOS or its the law.   Those things exist but that does not mean you should not treat every case individually. The way we have it currently social media censor dissenting opinions and that is plain, not right...</p>
<p>If it was really that big of a deal because of the "death threat" twitter could have removed that part or just said to change this that bot is just as easy to make they don't because they don't want the person's opinions on the site=!</p>

        <p>&rt;You agree to the TOS when you sign up. You broke it. You get suspended.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The end.</p>
<p>Do you apply this logic to other things like just the law in general if so that is a really scary mentality to have!</p>
<p>if you really think that every case someone breaks tos or breaks a law they should be punished 100% of the time than you have no objectivity,</p>
<p>I'm curious do you defend things like speeding tickets tooth and nail do you feel that anyone breaking the law in that way should be punished or do you think there should be some lenience depending on the situation if it's the latter(which most people think like cause most people speed a bit) why not extend that same logic to other things.</p>
<p>You are arbitrarily defending twitter of all things like, just cause something is a policy does not mean it's right I hate to be this guy but would you have defended the mentality of the 3rd reich because it was policy.</p>
<p>Now that and censorship because of "death threats" are 2 different things but the mindless obeying of the Policy is the same.</p>
<p>Your need to think to about the comment yourself and the context of the "death threat"</p>
<p>Social media companies are terrible about censorship I was censored on the Ontario government FB page for saying fucking as a describing word ina sentence they banned me for using an insulting word great excuse for censorship!</p>

        <p>That's not what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>In the normal Twitter way that this works is by reporting, and then a human actually takes a look at the report and makes a judgement on what it is.</p>
<p>As I said, there are daily many similar and way worse tweets that never get an insta-suspension. I've received death threats, insults regarding my sexual orientation and many other shit that supposedly is against Twitters TOS, and I've reported these people.</p>
<p>Most of the time, twitter ignore these reports, and people who do really disgusting shit continue in the platform.</p>
<p>But apparently there are "protected accounts", in which people automatically get suspended, even without the need of a report, and Boris Johnson is one of them.</p>
<p>This is what is known as selective enforcement.</p>
<p>Not only that, basically, once again, one of the main reasons you do not inta-suspend someone for writing " I hope you die" is because context is everything. If twitter did that for all accounts, basically people talking about a game, or a quote, or anything would get them suspended, even if it is not a violation of the rules.</p>
<p>But once again, in the case of Boris Johnson, Twitter will suspend anyone if they use certain words, regardless of context.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, you probably have not read the "Abusive behavior" section of Twitter rules, because they are pretty clear that because of the nature of how context in communication works:</p>
<p>" Some Tweets may seem to be abusive when viewed in isolation, but may not be when viewed in the context of a larger conversation. When we review this type of content, it may not be clear whether it is intended to harass an individual, or if it is part of a consensual conversation. To help our teams understand the context of a conversation, we may need to hear directly from the person being targeted, to ensure that we have the information needed prior to taking any enforcement action.</p>
<p>We will review and take action against reports of accounts targeting an individual or group of people with any of the following behavior within Tweets or Direct Messages."</p>
<p>They admit they need to review and ask people of the context of what they wrote. They aren't doing that with Boris Johnson, you get insta-suspended, which means that Twitter do not follow their own TOS.</p>
<p>And let's be honest, you do not really care about Twitter TOS, or you would understand what I was trying to say.</p>

        <p>That's the nature of moderation. More eyes are concentrated on high profile areas. Especially controversial ones.</p>
<p>I'm much more likely to be baneed if I tell someone here to fuck off in the thread at the top of the sub as opposed to this one.</p>
<p>You will get insta banned on any sub during a high profile AMA if you say something ban worthy.</p>

        <p>Insta-suspensions are not moderation, they are automated responses.</p>
<p>Basically in these cases they are just assuming everyone is in violation, violating their own TOS about reviewing reports.</p>
<p>I'm 100% sure my Tweet wasn't reported, as there were milliseconds between the moment I posted and the moment I got suspended, so no one actually saw it.</p>
<p>So once again, they aren't reviewing reports, as their own rules say is done, they are just suspending people without any human interaction.</p>
<p>These protected accounts are protected from Twitter rules.</p>

        <p>Saying I hope you die soon is not a nice thing to say but it's nota death threat...</p>
<p>by labeling it "wishing death upon someone" you are missing the whole point... </p>
<p>Anyway, It was good to see that your comment on the lockdown coming in Ontario saying so dumb actually got upvoted a bit!</p>
<p>maybe people in our province are actually waking up a little...</p>

        <p>Bro said “I hope” and not “I wish”. That means it is cannot be wishing death on someone. Bro has had his Twitter TOS attacked in name of fascism!</p>

        <p>Automatic algorithm suspension in accordance with the stated TOS. Nothing to do with Boris: people insult him on Twitter all day, every day.</p>
<p>Also, don't try to pass off 'I hope you die soon' as 'criticism.' We both know it isn't.</p>

        <p>Once again, it has completely to do with Boris, search the words "I hope you die" in the twitter search, and you will see a shit load of posts with these words every minute, none of them suspended.</p>
<p>Also, if we go about this, his tweet will cause actual harm on people, people who after seeing that they are not allowed to have a christmas diner might just push them over the limit and go and die.</p>
<p>After a long criticism of what he is doing, I used those words, because I believe they are appropriate. It's been almost a year since all this shit started, and Mr. Johnson has caused nothing but suffering, and shows no sign at all that he will change course any time soon.</p>
<p>For the good of not just people in the UK who have suffered irreparable damage to their lives because of this asshole, but of the world that gets influenced by these people with so much power and make the world worse, I just wish to the air he will just die to end so much suffering.</p>
<p>My tweet is one that probably no one will read, and that Boris Johnson will NEVER read, unless it somehow became controversial, but it has to be insta-deleted and my account insta suspended for it.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson can destroy millions of lives, he has the power to do almost whatever the fuck he wants during this shit, but tweeter really needs to protect him from someone ending a long critic note with nasty words.</p>
<p>As I've said before, I've been threatened to death in twitter, and every time I've reported these people Twitter never does anything about it, so yeah, let twitter enforce their TOS with bias, violating their own rules, and be OK with it.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you've had a really long and intense cry over this issue. I'm sure the person at the relevant intelligence agency who browsed your social media history (including this post) after Twitter automatically reported it to them has had a good laugh at you, just like most who have read this.</p>
<p>Enjoy the next 8 years of Conservative government, as Labour won't win the next one when currently so divided.</p>
