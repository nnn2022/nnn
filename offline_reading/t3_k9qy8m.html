    <strong>What's the end game?</strong>
    <p><p>I'd like to pose a question here to see what the general consensus is here on what the end goal is to all the covid hysteria that we've lived with for 9 months now.</p>
<p>I never would imagine we'd be dealing with this for this long, but I do distinctly remember some pundits and experts saying we're looking at a 12-18 month ordeal back in March. </p>
<p>Frankly I don't believe there really is an "end game" other than maybe a big cash grab by big pharma, I just think our government leaders are incompetent fools who overreacted on bad data and are to proud or worried of the consequences to admit they're wrong. None the less, I expect we'll be back to normal by Summer once cases and hospitalizations/deaths drop significantly because of vaccine distribution. </p>
<p>Other people here believe we really are in a "new normal." I see things posted about a Great Reset. They think social distancing restrictions and mask mandates will remain permanently regardless of covid. Maybe you believe like me. Would love to hear your feedback. Or maybe you think something more sinister is going on and a new normal is being pushed on us. And if you do believe that, then what can we do about it?</p></p>

        <p>"Health officials" (like Fauci) have already said that we still have to wear masks and social distance even after the vaccine, but even on some of the more doomy subs I see quite a few people saying that they are not willing to wear the mask once the vaccine comes out, so either the government will have to double down on that and REALLY start enforcing the masks and fines/possible arrest for non-compliance or they will end up just completely dropping it because realistically, people who have no job or money can't pay fines and arresting large swaths of people for something like mask compliance or failure to pay mask fines would probably be extremely unpopular, at least outside of reddit.</p>
<p>As far as the Great Reset.... i think this is a real thing that some governments are definitely going to pursue or are already pursuing. Like everything though, I think it will be a mishmash of countries that get on board with it totally, some will partially implement this and some will avoid it entirely, which does hurt the globalist agenda. How are things supposed to go back to normal when so many businesses are closing permanently and business owners are going bankrupt? Even non-business owners, just regular people whose job has closed or reduced hours so they are making either WAY less on unemployment (without the extra 600 from CARES act) or just working less hours, or not making any money at all. Businesses can't just recover that quickly after losing money for a year.</p>
<p>Once people have accrued enough debt (even via unpaid utility bills or rent) the solution will be offered, which ultimately is the great reset. Just give everything to the government in exchange for debt forgiveness. Desperate people will do desperate things.</p>

        <p>Part of it is to get rid of old folks that they see as in the way.  All this “Ok Boomer,” crap.  Hating older folks.  Blaming every problem in the world on them.  Wanting them to die and get out of the way of “progress.”  Now they have them all isolated, terrified to go out, and are starting to inject who knows what into them.</p>
<p>The last generation to fully support and fight for freedom, and be able to agree to disagree, are effectively eliminated. My folks are a perfect example.  Locked in their house for months.  Didn’t vote.  Scared to leave the house and be part of the system.</p>

        <p>The end game is clear as spelled out by the WHO and UN on their own web pages.  It's all about Agenda 2030, depopulation of the planet and eventually control of everyone through fear tactics.  The UN has been throwing around the word sustainable living for over 30 years now.  What that means is that you don't own property.  The government owns everything. <br>
 They push everyone into centralized living areas (big cities) and they control your food and all that you can do, aka freedom passes, vaccination passports and so on.</p>
