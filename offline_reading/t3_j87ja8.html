        <p>I want to use this opportunity to educate people what this term means in this context. In conspiracy literature, the term "New World Order" has been used to describe a distopian supernational regime, and footage of politicians using the term has been presented as proof that they want to create such a regime. I'm not saying that there are no plans to create distopian systems. But when politicians use the term "New World Order", they actually mean something different. </p>
<p>The term "New World Order" was first prominently used by George Herbert Bush after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the <em>system</em> <em>of</em> <em>international</em> <em>relationships</em> (aka "the international order", or just "world order") had been based on the Cold War. The USA had economically and militarily supported a number of countries in exchange for those countries siding with the US instead of the Soviet Union. This was a good deal for everybody. But when the threat of the Soviet Union vanished, the US government had to reevaluate the international strategy, or in their words, they had to create a new system of international relations - a new world order. </p>
<p>Bush had been director of the CIA and was accutely aware of this need for a new international strategy, that's why he used the term several times, including in a speech at the UN. but he lost the next election, and his successor, Bill Clinton was focused on domestic politics, so he didn't care much about building a new world order. For the next few decades, no new world order was created. The world remained adrift. Then around 2012, the Obama administration announced the "Pivot to Asia", basically a China containment strategy that was a copy of the previous Soviet containment strategy, but for China instead of Russia. Later President Trump intensified the China containment strategy, so now we basically have a "New World Order" that looks very similar to the old order, because it's a copy of the old order, just with a new opponent. </p>
<p>Here's also a video of a guy explaining the American-led order of Bretton Woods and the shift to a new order in a more entertaining way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-1MquvFmUA</p>
