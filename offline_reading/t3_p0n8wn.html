    <strong>Alternative Theory To the Virus</strong>
    <p><p>I’m starting to think this isn’t actually a contagious virus. That’s just not the government’s style. Hear me out. They are all about control. You can’t control a super contagious virus. The elite also NEVER wear masks. Only for photo ops. They are all old and not scared at all. To add to that, statistics say if someone in your household has the virus you only have a 12% chance of catching it too. How does that make sense for a virus that escaped a lab in China which no one has an immunity to? Then they say the vaccines are 90% effective but what does that number even mean if unvaccinated people have an 88% chance of not catching it from someone infected living in their household…. these numbers make no sense.</p>
<p>So…. what if it’s not a virus? What if it’s some kinda of chemical weapon they’re releasing that attacks the respiratory system, and 12% of the time 2 or more people from the same household were together at the time of dispersal? That would give them full control of the virus. They can ramp it up whenever they choose, to push w/e agenda they need. This is how they undermine our constitution and create a police state, by creating emergencies.</p></p>

        <p>Well, Canadian courts are unable to prove this virus really exists.</p>
<p>"Vaccine" efficacy is a bogus number, yes.</p>
<p>As for chemical warfare, it generally doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>If they had that kind of tech, they would not bother with this messy campaign right now.</p>
<p>Obviously, the goal is to inject as many people as possible right now with what is a dangerous gene modification. Why bother with that if they could opt to deploy a covert method of achieving their goals?</p>

        <p>I have no idea what’s in the vaccine. But I’m pretty sure the government has the ability to release chemical agents that attack the respiratory system</p>
<p>If Canada couldn’t produce a sample of the virus to keep Alberta on lockdown, they probably don’t actually have a sample. Just like when Powell holding up a bs vial said there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and they found none</p>

<p>Sure. But how far can these reach? How effective can they be on a global scale? We are already being poisoned with lots of chemicals on a daily basis. Plastics and such. They put fluoride into tap water to atrophy brains, too. This hasn't gone very fast, though.</p>

        <p>I don’t think they are far reaching. I think they could be deployed locally and the areas are planned. I don’t think just the U.S. government is in on this. I think this could involve all major governments.</p>

        <p>Yes but actual people are dying from some type of respiratory illness so something has to be killing them. I personally know too many people that died all in this short period from respiratory illnesses that required them to be on ventilators. So something is definitely killing people and I suspect it isn’t some random flu virus from China</p>

<p>I have seen lots of evidence for mistreatment of patients. Did you follow what was done to them exactly at the hospitals before they died?</p>
<p>There is a lot of evidence for people who were just fine with zinc, vitamin d, ivermectin, etc. Chemical weapons don't behave that way.</p>

        <p>There is a real virus. At the very least, it's the flu (which has somehow disappeared since covid became the only thing tested for). It might have been taken from nature to be gain of function modified in Wuhan. Or not.</p>
<p>Chemical weapons like Sarin behave very differently from a medical perspective. What we are seeing are flu like symptoms in the so called covid patients as well as false positives of random people dying of whatever and being labeled as covid deaths.</p>
<p>Most of these patients were mistreated, yes. Let us not forget that the medical profession is what carries this whole agenda on the frontlines right now.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s the flu bc I have friends who work in hospitals and they were full of people needing care at one point. I don’t think bad care is killing all those patients. I do think the false positives would’ve helped mask a chemical attack though.</p>
<p>You jump to Sarin but we could be dealing with something completely different. They have all the funding and time they need to develop weapons, who knows what they could have come up with.</p>
<p>The 12% number doesn’t add up, the fact that the elite never mask up doesn’t add up, the fact that the CDC hasn’t mandated their own employees to get vaccinated doesn’t add up… so much doesn’t add up for me. I’m not buying that it’s a real virus at this moment</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>So what is the synthesis this time?</p>
<p>If they wanted everyone dead, we would have gotten nuclear war years ago.</p>
<p>Looks like they want the injected dead, at least a portion of them.</p>
<p>Looks like they want all the people dead who could not cope with the pressure and lockdowns.</p>
<p>The proposition of "World government" and total slavery has been getting more and more unrealistic for years. The EU has been failing and was originally designed as the vessel for that NWO purpose. This final push, this final failure will open up a road for people to achieve new freedom by awakening to the truth around them.</p>

        <p>You’ve over complicated something that’s about control, power and mostly money. I like your open mindedness but something is only as complicated as you allow it to be. The government can’t even follow its own rules and the jab will most likely kill the weak by targeting defects in the DNA of the takers. My mates who’s a stress head PT had a heart attack. The jab just brought it forwards a few years. Birth levels are plummeting in most developed counties. Mobile phones and piss poor diets do that. In the U.K, you don’t really hear about teenage pregnancy anymore. They are all too busy on there  phones and games consoles to do that.</p>

        <p>I don’t think I’m over complicating it. I think that way of doing it is quite simple. All they have to do is release the agent when they need to ramp things up. No more unpredictability of a contagious virus. Idk, the way I see it things are just not adding up to a contagion. I’d have to force puzzle pieces that don’t belong to see that picture personally</p>

        <p>I ain’t slating you or saying your wrong as we only know the end game when people start dropping dead. The intelligence of most political people isn’t that great, so I doubt they’d make it very hard for the select few to understand. Borris Johnston isn’t in charge of the U.K as the queen signs off on everything major. Even she may take orders. We sadly will never know. I want a more peaceful world, with a race of people that respect each other and also Mother Nature. I may never get to see that but I can dream it.</p>

        <p>&rt;something is only as complicated as </p>
<p>it needs to be, too.</p>
<p>If the goal is eugenics, then the current modus operandi makes a lot of sense for the powers that be. Honestly, these things are already messy enough as they are.</p>
<p>9/11 was a fairly huge mess, too. And was a much easier operation.</p>

        <p>I don’t exactly get your point. Most likely, 1 of 2 things is going on.</p>
<p>The first being a random flu like virus escaped Wuhan and created a world Pandemic which would be such a convenient golden goose egg to have fall in the government’s lap to capitalize on —</p>
<p>Or the second being that they created this emergency, just like 9/11 and all the other emergencies they’ve created, and are dispersing  something locally that is causing respiratory illnesses within the public.</p>
<p>I’m leaning toward the latter. I think that’s the simplest explanation.</p>

<p>Yes. But why local? This is about the world.</p>

        <p>Not locally like just here, I mean they send people all over the world to different towns and cities so they can release the chemicals locally and not have to do it from far away.</p>

        <p>I have no doubt that a lot of cases are from bacterial pneumonia that the service workers get from wearing a mask non stop for 10 hours a day. Then they receive a positive PCR and bingo bango we have a pandemic.</p>
