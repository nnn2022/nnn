    <strong>It's kind of scary to think about how easily the covid vaccines could end up like most dangerous recalled drugs</strong>
    <p><p>Random thought about the vaccine. I know some folks think the government has an agenda behind wanting to get everyone vaccinated. What if that agenda isn't as complex as we think? What if it is genuinely just about money? </p>
<p>Then think about this....what if ten years from now the world realizes that the vaccine was the greatest mistake mankind ever made? </p>
<p>Look at all the drugs that have been recalled after being on the market for years. I can't remember all their names, but it's easy to find them in Google. Thalidomide comes to mind. Morning sickness drug given to pregnant women that caused babies to be born with horrendous birth defects. What if this vaccine ends up being like that? </p>
<p>Think about it. All those recalled drugs were tested for years on various types of people in various situations. Those drugs still ended up causing brain bleeds, liver failure, heart failure, death, birth defects,and much more. The covid vaccines were rushed as quickly as possible so as many people as possible could start buying them up. There is absolutely no way that these vaccines had proper testing. There's definitely no way they can know what the longterm effects are because the people currently being vaccinated are part of the ongoing testing. There's no way they tested people with all medical conditions, genetic predispositions, taking certain medications, etc. </p>
<p>Imagine if years from now we find out everyone who was taking xanax when vaccinated ends up with heart failure. Or everyone with a particular medical condition ends up dying years later. Or everyone with certain genetic makeup end up sterilized? Everyone in one age group who took a vaccine from a certain company ends up with a terminal cancer. </p>
<p>The possibilities are endless really. It wouldn't end with just tens of thousands being affected like typical recalled drugs. It would be on a global scale with millions affected. </p>
<p>I know I mentioned earlier that all this could be caused by greed. Simply rushing the drug out too fast and causing humanity's worst mistake ever. But it's even worse to imagine what if the powers that be meant for the vaccines to end in horror. Just imagine what it means for our future if a large number of the population dies or ends up sterile because of a rushed vaccine. </p>
<p>I just don't understand why so many are willingly signing up to be Guinea pigs. My 30 year old neighbor died mysteriously 2 weeks after getting her vaccine. Another neighbor around the same age said she felt absolutely terrible after her shots but thought that was fine. No thanks.</p></p>

        <p>I haven’t watched the video but on Sen Johnson’s event featuring people hurt from the shots included a 12 year old who’s mom signed her and brothers (no older than 15) for the clinical trials.</p>
<p>The poor girl seems to have been permanently injured and Mom is pikachu face surprised that the Pfizer doesn’t care is and neither studying her poor daughter further to avoid others suffering the same fate, nor helping her.</p>
<p>The whole thing is criminal.</p>

        <p>It's not as if Pfizer or any other companies pay off doctors to peddle their drugs. Oh, wait...</p>

<p>Synopsis: Pfizer agreed to pay $430 Million in 2004 to settle criminal charges that <strong>it had bribed doctors</strong> to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin for indications for which it was not approved.</p>
<p>and...</p>
<p>Pfizer received the biggest fine in U.S. history as part of a $2.3 Billion plea deal with federal prosecutors for mis-promoting medicines (Bextra, Celebrex) and <strong>paying kickbacks to compliant doctors.</strong> Pfizer pleaded guilty to mis-branding the painkiller Bextra by promoting the drug for uses for which it was not approved.</p>

        <p>They won’t. No one will EVER admit the wrongdoing that’s occurring. They will insist it’s something else (probably climate “change” since they can’t settle on global warming vs cooling).</p>
<p>These jabs may eventually fade out but no one will ever accept responsibility for the damage that has been caused; the result would be a global catastrophe with millions and millions of people furious with their governments for pushing an untested and damaging drug.</p>

        <p>Yeah, people can speculate on different theories or motives but I think it, along with most issues, can be simply boiled down to $$$. </p>
<p>Just to play devils advocate, we know so much more about this mRNA technology now that the world has volunteered itself to test it out. Down the line the insight actual scientists gained from this might be used to fight other diseases once it is polished. If you tell a big pharmaceutical company you’ll give them millions of dollars to test their product on people without liability their answer will be pretty obvious so it is useless to try and grasp at any layers deeper than that.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">Regulatory_capture</a></strong> </p>
<p>&rt;In politics, regulatory capture (also client politics) is a corruption of authority that occurs when a political entity, policymaker, or regulatory agency is co-opted to serve the commercial, ideological, or political interests of a minor constituency, such as a particular geographic area, industry, profession, or ideological group. When regulatory capture occurs, a special interest is prioritized over the general interests of the public, leading to a net loss for society. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".</p>

        <p>Well that was just an example. It could be a bad interaction with any drug, blood type, genes, race, lifestyle,anything. People are already seeing horrible effects. I could see long term effects being dreadful. For your mother's sake, I hope she is okay.</p>

        <p>So I did some reading. Y'all might not even see this because it's been awhile. Anyways, I felt it was important to mention it. I can link the articles if anyone is interested. I have found that reading news from 2020 and 2021 doesn't lead to much truth. I like to read articles from the past. I'm sure they had agendas back then as well but not quite like what's going on today. I think you can find some truth if you go back to the past. Put the pieces of the puzzle together from there. </p>
<p>I found that in 2017 Moderna's mrna vaccines were not doing too well in the trials and there had been like a billion or more dollars invested into the project. The articles seemed hopeful that mrna vaccines would do well in the future but they were not at the time. There was mention of Moderna needing to make that investment money back. </p>
<p>Here we are in 2021 and the mrna vaccines have saved the world. It's amazing how mrna vaccines went from not doing so well in 2017-2018 to saving the world in 2020. Doesn't seem plausible to me but maybe science is that great. </p>
<p>Then you have to look at the money aspect of it as well. What better way to recover a billion plus dollars than to make sure the entire world gets 2 vaccines from the project. </p>
<p>Y'all give it a try. Read articles from 2018 and earlier. You'll see that it is all very odd how the topic has changed so suddenly. Same goes for pharmaceuticals and the FDA in general. Articles used to be written about how the FDA rushes drugs because money and how pharmaceutical companies weren't as cautious as they should be because money. It used to be well known that drugs could end up being very dangerous. Now, all the articles say it is perfectly safe despite being rushed. Money,money, money.</p>
