    <strong>Interesting interview I had last year</strong>
    <p><p>So, some backstory. I'm a starting-out journalist named Joe Romney, and I was trying to do a story on the kind of... fine people that enjoy this sub, for example. Figured a good place to go would be a grocery store. When I got there I saw a guy not wearing a mask, so I figured he'd be a great place to start. I chat him up for a bit and we eventually get down to business. Very insightful interview, quite thought-provoking. I believe at the time I thought, "maybe my next story should be on the lacking education system in the United States." </p>
<p>Anyways, we start wrapping it up, and he says something to the effect of "They're taking away our civil liberties. I'm not going to go along with what the government is telling me to do, and that's my right. If I don't wanna be 'safe' as according to them, I don't have to be. Bottom line. They can take their government statutes and whatnot and shove it up their a**." At that, he closed the door to his Jeep. I observed him putting his seatbelt on as is required by Illinois law. He pulled out of his parking space, stopped at a stop sign, made his turn, and then waited at a traffic light. I was overwhelmed by the irony.</p>
<p>Anyways, what to all you fine folks have to say about this? I thought it was rather interesting.</p></p>

        <p>Wow - this little under achiever comes here and the best he can come with is the seat belt analogy?</p>
<p>Can someone point him to the remedial sub please. This is embarrassing. These are the type of intellects that want to become journalists. He can barely even compose a couple paragraphs and his attempts at wit are clumsy and sophomoric. </p>
<p>Someone else club this seal - he isn’t even worth it.</p>

        <p>Well he has a right (and freedom) to choose to wear his seatbelt, stop at stop signs, obey traffic signals, and get the vaccine. And deal with the consequences of above mentioned CHOICES.</p>

        <p>i think that with seatbelts and traffic lights there is obvious and long term proof that they save and protect lives - also, it thus makes sense looking at it rationally to adhere to these types of rules or laws.</p>
<p>all these things are lacking regarding the mRNA vaccines (specifically!) and most if not all of the covid-related enforced mandates such as masks especially outside, locking down businesses completely, mass pcr testing of people without symptoms and so on</p>
<p>i agree with another commenter here that based on what you wrote you might rather be a biased columnist that a good journalist. if i can know the stance of the writer on a subject when reading an article, then it is not journalism. so if you want you can share your article and we can discuss</p>
