<title>Do you think Floridians who hate what's happening here would move to states that support what they do? Or are they more likely to stay and complain all the time knowing that they're in a great state?</title>

        <p>The people you are referring to don’t know how to live their lives without complaining. It’s a part of every day life for them and it’s their choice of action for everything, as opposed to problem solving. That’s why moving doesn’t even cross their minds; that would be problem solving, and that’s not their MO.</p>

        <p>All over Reddit I see people complaining about this in Florida-related subs.</p>
<p>But I have yet to meet anyone in real life here who hates De Santis for this reason. De Santis isn't my personal hero and I am sure there are others who aren't a fan of him, but everyone I know is glad the state is open and knows covid is relatively not any worse here than anywhere else and that the state is in fact doing well when you consider the median age and population density. In my own personal opinion, there are bad things about De Santis that I don't like and I don't see him as Libertatian hero, but I do think that he managed this relatively well compared to the governors of other large states.</p>
<p>I have not heard a single person complain that the state isn't locked down. Everyone goes out. I hang out with other young Jewish people and other young people in the Miami area, so my friends tend to skew a bit liberal. And yet, we all talk endlessly about how glad we are to be here.</p>

        <p>I live in Florida and I've seen a lot of people complaining about the governor and the lack of enforced restrictions here and thinking he's some sort of murderer.</p>
<p>I also see how people from other states want to move here because of the lack of restrictions, so I was curious if people think that the complainers actually care that strongly to want to leave the state or if they're just blowing hot air because they know they would hate to live in a place like California or New York and the like.</p>
<p>I was also bored so I made a poll</p>
