    <strong>How do you handle the mundane repetitive lockdown imposed life?</strong>
    <p><p>There are days where when I have nothing to do I really don't even want to get up. Of course once I do I feel a lot better, but I can sit there in bed mentally sifting through what's available outside of my home. It's to the point now where I feel that accepting reality and owning it is better than just living in delusion or crying about it. For what it's worth - I work from home so this amplifies the aloneness.</p>
<p>My state does not allow for people to really live. I used to hang out with buddies in any weather, but how can I possibly meet up with someone when they're off work at night and it's windy + 20 degrees out? I suppose I could go out to eat, but that just means that instead of hanging out with a $3 coffee, now it's a $30 meal each time... I can't do that every time I meet up with someone.</p>
<p>I am well aware that I could be doing things more productively. I study history, the stock market, but that can't be my entire life. There are things in between that are called living.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The one thing that has absolutely infuriated me is that if you look at housing prices in Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Idaho - They're sky rocketing. Prices are up big time. My guess is from people moving to freer states. What does that mean for normal people? A. You've probably been outpriced and B. By the time the prices come down (If ever) will the politics have changed so much that it's just another locked down hellhole from the new voters?</p>
<p>I feel trapped.</p></p>

        <p>You can set up a makeshift bar in your garage. My buddy definitely did not do that, because it would be illegal, and a bunch of us definitely don't hang out there. And it's absolutely no fun at all, allegedly ;)</p>

        <p>I have put a lot of miles on my car in the last year, I cannot stand to be locked in my house and if everything is closed then I will just get in the car and drive. </p>
<p>I live in Colorado which was still pretty locked down, but on the Wyoming border and Wyoming gives zero fucks so if you want to live, you just drive a state over and restaurants are open, retail is open, you can see people‚Äôs faces and have a normal human interaction. </p>
<p>I also took up thrift shopping as a hobby. I figure people who are out at the thrift stores know that they‚Äôre in germ central so if grandma took that risk to come to the goodwill, then she knew what she was getting into. You do see a lot of senior citizens out doing ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù shopping because they also don‚Äôt want to be locked in their houses like animals.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve been trying to teach myself new things. And I have a lot of hobbies and side things that in before-times, I was always wishing I had more time for. </p>
<p>But I‚Äôm with you, some days, things feel so bleak and dystopian that even the things that bring me joy and fulfillment like learning new stuff or painting or making things just can‚Äôt cut it. And I‚Äôve spiraled into many a deep hole. The things that bring LIFE to life like laughing and hugging and talking to strangers and music and art and dancing and food and sharing the world with others are so, SO important-dare I say essential?- that to be without them is truly soul-crushing. </p>
<p>But here‚Äôs the thing that I keep trying to remind myself: if we ever get out of this, I don‚Äôt want to look back on this time where I had all this forced free time and I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything, so I try to take advantage of that as much as I can. It does help me get out of bed in the morning. I‚Äôve also decided to not get upset with myself if I DON‚ÄôT accomplish anything, because the world is in fact depressing. But at least I tried. </p>
<p>Also having a handful of people in my life who also think this is all bullshit helps immensely.</p>
<p>As far as the housing thing goes, prices are going up in CA as well, and we‚Äôre imprisoned as fuuuh. I think it has more to do with the fact that people who had money before either kept making the same money and not spending it or made more money. Plus with interest rates being so low, people are enticed into buying.</p>

        <p>Regarding the housing situation we wanted to move last year but covid fucked it up and then I had a really bad motorcycle crash.
Only recently we looked into houses again but the rules have changed now, you are not allowed to view a house for sale unless your house is already sold or you are a cash buyer. Again rich have it easy while the rest of us has to jump through hoops on fire. This is UK btw.</p>

        <p>My life hasn't really changed to be honest.  I was laid off for a little under 3 months starting march 2020 but ever since I went back to work its normal.  Go to work then home. I dont wear a mask at work or anywhere  I go. I dont go many places. But I was an introvert before and didnt really go anywhere.</p>

        <p>I've taken up a new hobby, digital painting. Sometimes it can eat up 6 hours of the day. In fact I'm finding I don't get as much reading or music done as I'd like as a result. Can't have it all I suppose xD</p>

        <p>I have a 6 month old baby so that takes up a lot of my time but it really sucks that I can't do much with her because everything is closed. I really wanted to take her to baby swim classes so bad but all the public pools are closed right now. I wish it was possible to do mommy and me get together type things too so she can have interaction with other babies but that's obviously out of the question too.</p>
