    <strong>The reason masks aren't helping us</strong>
    <p><p>For masks to actually work (and even then they won't cover full protection) you would have to replace them carefully every few hours (like surgeons do), you wouldn't be able to constanly touch it / adjust it without gloves or with your bare hands without washing them and you would absolutely have to wear it properly, covering your nose with it (which the masses aren't doing anyway). I doubt you follow all of these rules (that's actually really understandable) and even if you do, the vast majority doesn't, which makes the masks pretty much useless. When people don't replace masks and when they use the same mask for days/weeks/months, the mask actually does more harm than good as the germs stay on that mask.</p>
<p>As far as I see it, they are just one more problem / inconvenience in this pandemic. I've seen photos with thousands of masks thrown away in the ocean - who doesn't love pollution?</p>
<p>Also, if the government cares so much about us, why do we have to pay for them? If our health was really their concern, they would make sure every single person gets enough masks free of cost.</p></p>

        <p>that’s exactly what I say to everybody who loves the stupid masks. they all are wearing very dirty masks and touching their faces millions of times. plus many of them are with that dirty mask in the chin or with the nose outside. very nasty thing to have such a thing in the face collecting germs all day. many people are wearing the same shit for several days 😑</p>

        <p>Wear one with little air flow for 8 hours straight for days on end, you'll know damn well why and how everyone is going to get sick from them and it's going to blamed on covid using the fake tests to ramp up more restrictions. I went in the grocery store the other day and I could hear the coughs and sniffles from behind all the perpetual mask wearers and thought "oh boy here we go!". Weather just started getting cooler here so people are going to have more mucus with toxins in it to expel from their sinuses and these people are wearing masks all day long made of toxic compounds on top of making them breath stale, recycled air for hours on end. I'll let you predict where that's going but they're all going to be sick very quickly from what is going to look like a viral infection but they really just poisoned themselves to death with the masks and carbon dioxide in an environment that is already putting a strain on the body. What about their diets too, most people I know don't eat too well and eating junk is always going to thicken the mucus creating a disaster that will be blamed on covid. Never thought being able to predict the future would be so easy these days.</p>

        <p>You might be surprised to learn that the science behind the use of masks <em>even in a surgical setting</em> is not robust.</p>
<p>From waaaaay back in 2015:</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/">Examination of the literature revealed much of the published work on the matter to be quite dated and often studies had poorly elucidated methodologies. As a result, we recommend caution in extrapolating their findings to contemporary surgical practice. However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination. More rigorous contemporary research is needed to make a definitive comment on the effectiveness of surgical facemasks.</a></p>

        <p>Exactly. I particularly cringe at those who wear them jn public restrooms and then continue to wear the same mask after!!!! I mean..think about it. Or worse, they use the restroom at a restaurant and then go back to the table, touch dirty mask, place dirty mask on table, eat food with dirty fingers (if finger food). I mean....yeah gross</p>

        <p>The reason masks aren't helping us: Because what we call Covid is not caused by a virus. What we call the virus is a symptom, not a cause. It is not an airborne-communicable illness. We are being lied to at every turn and it is all a game of control and manipulation.</p>

        <p>Could you expand on this? I’ve been skeptical about Covid from day one, but I am growing more and more convinced that this virus isn’t “novel” at all. I mean, half of the time, these tests aren’t even detecting Covid, but rather old viruses that our immune systems recovered from. It’s really not too far fetched in my opinion.</p>

        <p>This is straight up gas lighting. The pressure to wear masks has been absolutely intense. It's unprecedented. People are being fined for not wearing them. People are not allowed into pretty much any building with out them. Children are forced to wear them all day at school. There are million dollar ad campaigns dedicated to push people to wear masks. For months the merits of masks have been screamed in our ears from politicians, celebrities, and average joes. We have been shamed for even questioning it. Debate on the subject has been completely shut down because people think it's too dangerous to disagree with mask wearing. People are being accused of wanting to kill grandmas when they don't wear masks. To now say that masks are just one component is disingenuous and doesn't reflect the reality of how masks have been promoted through out the world. But now that the data is clearly showing that masks really don't have any measurable impact on slowing the spread of this virus, and you guys are all backtracking and changing your tune. It's just one minor part that might help when combined with washing your hands and social distancing. Give me a break.</p>
