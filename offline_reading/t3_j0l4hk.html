<p>NY is what it is, and has always been for as long as anybody can remember: the sort of place where "trendy" is considered to be a compliment. There's no point to trying to fix a place where the locals seldom have minds of their own.</p>
<p>All one can do is leave such a place and let it burn. Sensible people can find better lives elsewhere, while the sheep can stay home and wait for the slaughter. Societal collapses have seldom been gentle affairs.</p>

        <p>Completely agree! It's definitely a waste of energy to try to get them to move though, most people are not brave enough to start new lives elsewhere. I take immense comfort in the fact that I've set up my life so that I can move anywhere I want though!</p>

        <p>Sounds good.</p>
<p>At present, I'm looking into moving out of Chicago, which was a miserable place to live before the Covid madness struck and has only gotten worse. Definitely out of Chicago, probably out of Illinois, given that some of the suburbs now have lockdowns worse than Chicago's.</p>
<p>Avoiding the next three years of Pritzker's domination of this state wouldn't be bad, either.</p>

<p>Go on patting yourself on the back and acting as if the possession of a 212 area code number was an accomplishment. I'm sure that will impress somebody, somewhere, I just can't imagine why.</p>
<p>You're living in the past. u/xyz123-nyc. When anybody can be seen by everybody on the Internet, where a trend begins ceases to matter, because no city comes close to being as large as the virtual communities.</p>
<p>Also, you failed to understand a word I said, which I find to be a fairly typical performance for major city residents.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; When was the last time  North Dakota did anything for anyone? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All rural areas are North Dakota, now? Without rural places, the cities would run out of food and starve within weeks. Without rural people, ore wouldn't get mined and factories would get shut down.</p>
<p>Also, most university campuses are located in college towns, out in the middle of what I used to call "God forsaken nowhere"- something that used to annoy me as I contemplated my future job search, but now brings me pleasure. What have smallish towns, far away places like Manhattan, given us? Most of the science and technology you currently benefit from, for one thing. But yes, the major cities have given us trends.</p>
<p>Like defecation in the streets and twerking. What would we do without those?</p>
<p>While we're at it, the great city of London had a mere 50,000 residents as late as 1500, which means that a lot of what we think of as classical European culture arose in a world that, to our eyes, would have appeared rural. When modern New York comes close to matching the cultural accomplishments of the far smaller cities of Medieval Europe, I might start taking it seriously as a trend setter, but until then, I'm going to remind people like you that trends aren't always good ones.</p>
<p>Not you, just people like you. This is where we part company.</p>

        <p>Now, you are right about the internet - everyone is connected. Whether you are in Uttar-Pradesh or in Stockholm you (more or less) have the same voice.</p>
<p>First, we were talking about culture. You talk about crops and agricultural output... nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>"most university campuses are located in college towns, out in the middle of what I used to call "God forsaken nowhere" Let's take the universities with the biggest influence.<br>
-Harvard is in Cambridge, a suburb of Boston (hardly rural)<br>
-Stanford is next to Palo Alto (hardly rural)
-Yale is in New Haven, CT (hardly rural)<br>
-Oxford is in... well Oxford, UK (hardly rural)<br>
-Columbia is in next to Harlem (Manhattan)<br>
-Sorbonne is in the heart of Paris (again hardly rural).<br>
-McGill is in the middle of Montreal (same for UofT in Toronto)
and I could go on..even major State Universities like U of W is in Madison, albeit a small town but not rural.
You would agree that most of these prestigious universities gave us "Most of the science and technology you currently benefit from, for one thing."
Not Western Dakota Tech in Grand Rapids... universities in cities.</p>
<p>Let's talk about trends that city dwellers brought to the table:
-Democracy
-Labor laws and unions
-Music and musical movement (Jazz in Chicago, classical in Vienna etc... you don't really hear a seminal art movement coming from Little Rock AK, correct?)
-Art in all its form (poetry, sculptures, paintings)
-Litterature.
But of course you have to boil it down to "defecation in the streets and twerking" By this logic should I say that the only thing you brought were Incest, Opoid Addiction and Bestiality ?</p>
<p>Also your anachronistic example is really dumb and shows a lot.
Yes, London had around 50k in 1500, but it was still one of the biggest city in the world.
Fargo, ND has a population of 125k today... apart from the show, give me an honest answer as to what is the cultural influence of the city...</p>
<p>And when I think you guys vote is worth more than urban vote... smh.</p>

<p>Your overconfident ignorance is amusing. Ever hear of the University of Illinois? The flagship campus is nowhere near Chicago. It a land grant university in a town a lot smaller than Madison, surrounded by cornfields.</p>

<p>Special pleading; you tell us that Fargo, ND has a population of 125 K, which it does (approximately), and then lightly skip over the fact that most college towns are smaller than that.  Fargo is an example of what  one should expect from a less urbanized world, but Madison, Urbana, et al are not - why? Apparently, because a New Yorker who is so ignorantly, belligerently loud as to be a stereotype says so.</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin isn't on a farm, but isn't in a major city or near one, either. One should also notice that it many of these towns, the students are, themselves, a large fraction of the total population. To look at a wide spot in the road that grew because a college campus was built in it, and then try to use growth was triggered by the growth of the campus as evidence of the necessity of "large cities " (conveniently redefined from moment to moment) for the development of any sort of scholarship is to disingenuously switch cause and effect, and hope the reader doesn't catch wise.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Oxford is in... well Oxford, UK (hardly rural)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's look that up, shall we? Oxford is listed as having 154,600 , making it slightly larger than Fargo, and a lot smaller than Madison (264 K).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;First, we were talking about culture. You talk about crops and agricultural output... nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Everything to do with it.  Need I remind you of your own ignorantly dismissive comment, above? This was it, in case you've forgotten.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;When was the last time North Dakota did anything for anyone?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When was the last time farmers did anything for anybody? Really? A better question would be "when was the last time yuppies did anything for anybody." The world managed to get by decently well for thousands of years without advertising executives in it. What would happen to us if the farmers suddenly vanished?</p>
<p>Who really does more for the world?</p>

<p>&rt;Also your anachronistic example is really dumb and shows a lot. Yes, London had around 50k in 1500, but it was still one of the biggest city in the world.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Do you even know what the word "anachronistic" means?</p>
<p>One can only guess as to what your argument is supposed to be, as you do little other than posture angrily, but you seem to be trying to argue (however incoherently) that high culture is something that requires huge cities with high population densities.</p>
<p>When you fail to understand that the emergence of culture that is held in such high esteem in our more urban world (in a world of  what to us would seem like small towns) undercuts your theory, the only stupidity on display is your own.</p>
<p>As for London being "one of the biggest city in the world" (sic), your history is a little bit off.  Beijing  already had a population of 672,000, over ten times that of London. Only one city in Western Europe (Paris) found its way into the top ten, that year. As for this year, let's take a look at some of the cities which are bigger than New York:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.citymayors.com/features/largest_cities1.html">http://www.citymayors.com/features/largest_cities1.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Seoul,  São Paulo, Bombay, Jakarta, KarachiMexico City</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Please, without using a search engine - tell me about some of the trends influencing our lives coming out of the largest city in Pakistan, a<em>nd why they are good things</em>. That's the point you seem either unwilling or unable to get - that to sent a trend is not, in and of itself, a valid source of pride.</p>
<p>Yes or no - are you prepared to agree with the idea that the cities I just listed are more important than New York? Your assumptions would seem to compel you to do so, but will you?</p>
<p>You also mention Paris, don't you? Some of the cities larger than Paris are ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Delhi, Cairo, Teheran, Bogota, Bandung, Tianjin, Lima, Lahore, Bogor, Santiago, Shenyang, Calcutta, Sydney, Guangzhou, Madras, Baghdad, Pusan, Yokohama, Dhaka, Malang, Hyderabad, Chongquing, Haerbin, Ankara, Buenos Aires, Chengdu, Ahmedabad, Xian, Surabaya, Pyongyang, Nanjing, Kinshasha, Taipei, Zibo, Dalian, Taegu, Addis Ababa, Jinan, Salvador, Inchon, Semarang, Giza, Changchun,  Havana, Nagoya, Bela Horizonte</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Paris, which you list as a trend setter, comes in at only 79th place in a ranking of cities by population - not a large city by world standards, at all. How do you explain that?</p>
<p>Not that all of the cities larger than Paris are places that most of us will have never heard of, until now, of course. Wuhan is on the list, and they certainly have been setting a trend of sorts, haven't they? But really, when the trend involves killing grandma with a virus, and tearing apart the social fabric of the world, I'm thinking that's a trend we'd all be better off without.</p>
<p>Three cities in the US have more people than Paris (which has 2.152 million people): New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, which is also larger than Rome and Madrid. But even the most crazed local booster I've ever met in Chicago wouldn't dare to suggest that Chicago has culturally given more to the world over the centuries than any of the European cities I just named did.</p>
<p>Florence, Venice ... these names echo through history, but how large are they? 380,000 and 261,000 respectively, Tulsa, Oklahoma is bigger than either. Would you seriously claim that it was more significant?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Let's talk about trends that city dwellers brought to the table: -Democracy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Nice Try.  Democracy arose in Athens. During antiquity, the entire city-state of Athens (not to be confused with what we would today term to be the city) didn't reach 100 thousand people until some time after 500 BC, about 100 years after the "foundations for democracy were laid" by Solon</p>
<p><a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/kapparis/AOC/ATHENS.htm">http://users.clas.ufl.edu/kapparis/AOC/ATHENS.htm</a></p>
<p>There was, of course, a European city that would have been considered a sizable one by present day American standards, back during late antiquity: Rome, the city that went on to found a police state.</p>
<p>When representative government finally re-appeared after a long absence, outside of a few isolated locations like San Marino (present day population 33,785), it did so, not in London, but in an America where the largest city at the time was Philadelphia (with 40,000 people, as I recall).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Not Western Dakota Tech in Grand Rapids</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Grand Rapids used to be located in Michigan, which is well to the east of the Dakotas. Has it moved?  🙂</p>

<p>No, you do not get to set bounds on the debate in such a matter.</p>
<p>You have a theory that large cities are just inherently more influential and culturally productive than smaller ones - maybe. You express yourself in such vague terms that pinning you down on exactly what you are saying is a difficult talk, but certainly you have been hinting this.</p>
<p>Very well, then - under your own theory, Paris would become irrelevant, as would  almost all of Europe. Malang would be one of the real trend setters, Parisians would strive to follow the trends coming out of there, and the West would be a cultural footnote, lost in History, as Europe was culturally assimilated by the non-Western countries with bigger cities. But that hasn't happened, now has it?</p>
<p>How many people in the West have even heard of Malang?</p>
<p>Your theory makes a testable prediction about how people will behave in the real world, that would directly contradict your own assertion that Paris is a trend setter. You've contradicted yourself. Your response to this embarrassing discovery is to tell me that I'm not allowed to notice this, because Malang has been put outside of the limits of what I'm allowed to be aware of, as I put your theory to the test.</p>
<p>My response to that is to tell you to get over yourself. That, and to consider the merits of becoming the next person to block you.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;By the way there’s a city called Grand Rapid in North Dakota</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You didn't say "Grand Rapid" in the comment to which I replied, you said "Grand Rapids." Western Dakota Tech is located in Rapid City, which is located in South Dakota, not North Dakota.</p>
<p>They're different states. As for your childish attempt at oneupsmanship, when a place name that applies to more than one place is given, and none of the places in question are local, the implication is that one is speaking of the place that is well known. Grand Rapids, Michigan has 200,000 people. Grand Rapids, ND has 87. Obviously, the former is more widely known than the latter.</p>
<p>When you pretend otherwise, you're trolling.</p>

<p>&rt;  Music and musical movement (Jazz in Chicago,  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Try again. Chicago did not invent Jazz. Nor did it invent Blues.  New Orleans has a far stronger claim to either, and even that claim is a little shaky; Jazz / Blues did not arise in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Note: the use of the word "Jazz" as the name for a genre of music would have amused its early creators and horrified their mothers - it was a word used to describe the act of procreation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; classical in Vienna etc... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let us note that Vienna, at around the time of Mozart's death, had fewer people than Madison, Wisconsin does today.</p>
<p>Where would you get the idea that Vienna invented classical music, all on its own? Probably the same place where you got the idea that Chicago invented Jazz - you just made it up. You don't do your homework, at all, you just post whatever pops into your head and hope that you will be believed.</p>
<p>Composers would become famous and be invited to come to Vienna, because that was the capital for the Austrian Empire. In order to be composers and get that invitation, they would have had to write music, first, so sorry, no, Classical Music did not arise in that or any other imperial court. It arose all over Europe, not in one place. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Art in all its form (poetry, sculptures, paintings)  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ever notice how many rural landscapes were painted by Monet? The artist's residence was in Giverny, which to this day has only 509 people. You claim to live in New York, but to maintain the ignorance you so confidently push, you would have to have never spent much time in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has a large collection of work by that very artist. I know, because (apparently unlike you), I've seen it.</p>
<p>He was hardly the only artist to go out into the countryside.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; - Litterature </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The fact that you misspelled "literature" made that amusing. Let's see ... grabbing names at random ... Longfellow was from Maine (a thinly populated state to this day), Mark Twain was from Hannibal, Missouri ...</p>
<p>Your claim that literature (that's spelled with one t before the e)  can only be written in cities doesn't seem to have much to do with ... I'm going to introduce you to a new word, now, so brace yourself ... reality.</p>

<p>&rt; you don't really hear a seminal art movement coming from Little Rock AK, correct? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Correct in my case, perhaps, though not really meaningful in the way that you would want it to be. Little Rock currently has 197,881 people, making it larger than any of the college towns mentioned so far, Oxford included.</p>
<p>Also, for all I know, there could be a seminal art movement about to come out of there. If so, I wouldn't be surprised. There are a lot of things I don't know about. "I haven't heard about it" and "it doesn't exist" aren't two different ways of saying the same thing. When you act as if they are, as you did above, you show yourself to not merely be uneducated, but in fact uneducable.</p>
<p>The process of education is a pushing back against the frontiers of one's own ignorance. When one refuses to recognize the existence of those frontiers, as you evidently do, the process never has a real chance to begin. So, let us not read more into my acknowledgement than is actually there to be found. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; And when I think you guys vote is worth more than urban vote... smh. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Let's ponder the fact that both I and u/up_to_a_point are PhD candidates, and that you're the sort of person who would write an attempted at sentence like that one. I'll try to fix that "sentence" for you.</p>
<p><em>"When I think that you rural people have more voting power than do people living in urban areas, I shake my (darned) head."</em></p>
<p>Yes, I know which word in supposed to go there, but I don't want to set off the robotic moderator.</p>

<p>You're probably going to try to salvage your thoroughly demolished argument by doubling down on this silly point</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Yes, London had around 50k in 1500, but it was still one of the biggest city in the world. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but if so, it will get you nowhere. To begin with, aside from being rooted in a historical inaccuracy (the assertion that London was one of the biggest cities in the world), it runs into a trivial point that you seem unable to understand - no matter many people abandon the major cities and head out into the countryside, there will always be a largest town on earth. If people abandon New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, Cheyenne, Wyoming, will still be bigger than the humorously named Metropolis, Illinois.</p>
<p>For your argument to have anything to do with anything other than your own feelings, then, you have to make the case that going forward, a hypothetical "Cheyenne-dominated" (sarcastic quotes), which is to say a relatively rural future, would be a less productive one than one that looked more like our present - a time in which, you might notice, not much of anything is getting done by almost anybody, because we don't the freedom to do much of anything.</p>
<p>You can't achieve this, simply by noticing that Cheyenne would be a tiny replacement and (supposedly) a huge comedown from "the great city of New York" (as we've all heard it called). If being concentrated in one place invariably made people happier and more productive, then why did so many of them find themselves being abandoned and falling into ruin toward the end of the Roman Empire? Why would the individual Roman choose to move away from prosperity and culture, if those were what was waiting for him in those fading cities?</p>
<p>Cities, when they prosper, don't really create the culture that comes out of them. There are some people born in them who contribute, but most importantly, these cities will have enough money to attract some of the people who produce said culture. Had Beethoven stayed in the then small town of Bonn because he lived in a world in which there was no Viennese court, he would still be Beethoven and his work would still be his work.</p>
<p>The major cities, at present, aren't prospering, and haven't prospered for quite a while, so the draw of money isn't there any more. Will this mean the end of art, of literature, of music? No, why would it? The cities have fallen before - consider the state Rome was in during most of the Middle Ages. Art goes on.</p>

<p>I live in Chicago, as I've already told you. Repeatedly. To be exact, I live in a high rise on the near north side, within easy walking distance of the John Hancock Tower on N. Michigan and relatively easy walking distance of the Loop.  If that's your idea of a rural area, then there are nothing but rural areas in France and Italy, given that Chicago is larger than any city in either country.</p>

<p>As for Science ... your ignorant cockiness goes on amusing me.

<p>Los Alamos National Laboratory - Located in a town of 12,000 people in New Mexico.</p>
<p>You might try to come back by mentioning Fermilab and Argonne, but sorry, no. Those aren't located in Chicago, they're located out in some areas that are vaguely associated with the suburbs of Chicago, in places sparsely populated enough that Fermilab can get away with keeping its own herd of buffalo on its grounds. It's far enough out that one can notice the shift in accent. Argonne is closer, but still far enough out to be in the middle of a forest ("Waterfall Glen"). It has deer, another type of animal not really suited to urban life.</p>
<p>Los Alamos came to mind for me immediately, because unlike you, I've been to grad school. When I talk about where the jobs in the Sciences are located, I actually know what I'm talking about, which is to say that I know a lot more about this subject than some semi-literate blowhard from Queens (or wherever you're from) ever will.</p>
<p>Have I managed to get this point through your thick skull, yet?</p>

        <p>I appreciate your long answer (albeit I wish it was with less personal insults... ). 
You have a PhD and i applaud you for that. I have a double master in history and marketing but no PhD. 
Both of you studied longer than i would ever could. 
Good on you. 
I have a double Master’s degree in history and marketing but I am painfully “barely educated” according to you. Fair enough. </p>
<p>Now, I’m sorry my Argument is hollowed by my “constant mangling” of the English language. English is my 3rd language. I would and could have a more argumentative point of view in French or Italian if you wish. 
My main point was about culture. Of course labs are extremely important. And some of them are in rural areas. I admit that. Roche and Sanofi labs aren’t based in major urban areas. That’s true. </p>
<p>Pardon my “ignorant cockiness” stating that culture lives in places where people are “en masse” (that’s French by the way). </p>
<p>Monet did live in Giverny, but he made his “fait d’armes” (French again) in Paris. Also giverny is half way between Rouen (4th or 3rd biggest city in France at that point) and Paris (capital of France). 
Giverny was accessible by a train (it’s only about 70min away from “la petite couronne”) And yes it’s a more of a  rural area but would you say the same about Long Island or Montauk in regards to NYC? </p>
<p>It no mystery that cities are the nest for new/controversial (guess what, thats à French word) ideas. </p>
<p>Apart from Bill Clinton, tell me what happened/exists in Little Rock, AK that will be talked in the history books. 
Giverny is in the books because of Monet. Not because of the city itself. </p>
<p>PS: I don’t come from Queens, nor am I an American. I’m an immigrant living in LES. But wtv.</p>

<p>That's a point against your theory, not one in favor of it. Little Rock is, as I've already told you, larger than the city of Oxford, in the UK. Yet, as you've acknowledged yourself, Oxford (owing to the presence of its university) carries far more weight, culturally, than does the larger Little Rock.</p>
<p>So much for the larger place always being the influential one. Also, so much for any pretense that you're anything but a bad actor in this discussion. I had already made that point before you ever replied, and now you're forcing to repeat myself by misleading the reader about what I had to say in a different branch of the discussion.</p>
<p>This is underhanded, intellectually dishonest behavior for which you absolutely must be condemned.</p>

<p>In other words, you'd like to be as rude and arrogant as you've been throughout, and be greeted with warmth, friendliness and support.</p>

<p>Your main point was debunked by your own acknowledgment, given when you wrote these words</p>
<p><em>"Now, you are right about the internet - everyone is connected. Whether you are in Uttar-Pradesh or in Stockholm you (more or less) have the same voice."</em></p>
<p>If  somebody living in an "influential city" has "the same voice" as somebody who does not, then the entire concept of an influential city has become outdated, leaving you living in the past.</p>

<p>Again, nice try.</p>
<p>France has rough the same land area as the state of Texas and 67 million people. That its cities are closer to each other than American ones are is no surprise and really, to any reasonably well educated person, no secret.</p>
<p>Travel times between French cities are shorter, so the standard for being in a remote area in France aren't going to be the same in France as they will be in the US.</p>
<p>I'd add that nobody considers Long Island to be urban, aside from the end of it on which Brooklyn and Queens are to be found.</p>

<p>&rt; Pardon my “ignorant cockiness” stating that culture lives in places where people are “en masse” (that’s French by the way). </p>

<p>This is where our conversation, and any conversation we might have had in the future, ends. You're a person without intellect or integrity, and I won't pretend to have any use for you.</p>

        <p>I can only speak for DFW, but yeah, most everything is open with some workarounds (though the most popular bars in Denton specifically have not done so to appease UNT students), no travel restrictions, just have to wear a mask indoors. I'll admit we have it pretty easy compared to other states, but it doesn't negate the premise that constitutional rights are not fairweather rights.</p>

        <p>Cover band doing everything from classic rock to 90s-current country, 80s pop and 90's-2000's rock. Kinda just depends on the venue and the crowd. I use a Tradition Jerry Reid artist series Tele, a Schecter C1+ with upgraded pickups and a Taylor 314ce acoustic. Running direct through a Strymon Iridium and ton of other pedals.</p>
