    <p><p>So that means I'M right and you're WRONG. This is just how things are now and if you don't like it get the jab!! PEOPLE ARE DYING, and I don't mean those committing suicide, missing their cancer treatments because of the insane backlog or the RARE few that are suffering after their heckin' jab BUT the PERFECTLY HEALTHY AND NOT AT ALL OLD/OBESE spluttering out their last breaths through a ventilation tube!! Yes, in my mind most of them are unvaccinated SCUM but they're prolonging this  heckin' pandemic and OVERWHELMING the hospitals!!!</p>
<p>We NEED a vaccine passport because otherwise the filthy plague-rats (unvaxxed) will infect the pure superheroes (vaxxed) and END US ALL WITH THEIR HECKIN' MUTATIONS. Scared yet?! You should be!! Jim Crow and Nazi Germany type SEGREGATION is the only way through this and I'm sure this won't backfire on us AT ALL. Of course any comparisons to The Holocaust are BANNED and DISGUSTING if you're the one we're targeting so keep your filthy fucking plague-rat mouths shut!! If you don't like it,  again... GET THE JAB. SCHNELL SCHNELL!!!</p>
<p>Look, things are just BETTER now... mm'kay? Maybe I'm biased but I think I speak for everyone when I say I LIKE working from home... I LIKE being told what to do... I LIKE wearing a mask or two or three or however many they tell me to at a certain time (heck, if they tell me polka dots on my mask stop Covid betterer then I'll polka dot that son of a bitch straight away)... I LIKE living in constant fear of a cold virus with a 99.9% survival rate... I LIKE having headaches and shivering like a shitting dog after my heckin' jab because it means IT'S WORKING... I LIKE having no moral convictions beyond what the government and media tell me I should or shouldn't care about.</p>
<p>I enjoy being a spineless, gutless worm and I think it's absolutely repugnant that you don't join me in the fucking dirt. NO, I don't care if your life has been ruined by the lockdowns, and NO I don't care if  you've got valid reservations for not getting the jibby-jabber or its seven boosters, AND NO I don't care that no one you know has died from or with Covid AND FUCKING NO I don't care that you feel like ending it all sometimes, I'm going to scream at you until you STOP CRYING and GET THAT FUCKING JAB. I'm a GOOD PERSON AND THIS PANDEMIC HASN'T CHANGED A FUCKING THING ABOUT ME!!!!!!!</p></p>
