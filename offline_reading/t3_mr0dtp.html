    <strong>WTF am I supposed to do at this rate as a student?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm 18 and literally being pushed to go get the vaccine. They kept contacting me saying oh you can come get it and I've been saying no..... Anyways: This on top of the Great Reset is really making the idea of fucking off to a farm sound great, except they'll probably figure some way to fuck me over anyway, so the next viable option is probably moving to another planet cause this shit is fucking ridiculous.</p>
<p>And I'm sure within a couple months those unvaccinated people won't be able to go to university or work because.... reasons. Even though those that ARE vaccinated literally can still catch and spread the virus that is ACTIVELY mutating as we speak. I wouldn't be surprised if they start giving out "booster shots" every 3 months making vaccines a normal occurrence.</p>
<p>What options are you guys thinking of? The only thing that's gonna save us at this point is war.</p></p>

        <p>First and foremost: <strong>do not get the vaccine</strong>. You are young and many mistakes you make at this stage of life can be fixed later; permanent DNA alteration is not one of those things. It may be very stressful to resist the social pressure surrounding vaccination: this is by design. But successfully shrugging it off will equip you with the skills you need to get by if and when things get worse. If your college starts requiring vaccination or other medical procedures, consider dropping out and either finding work (ideally in a hands-on industry where you can find mentorship and learn practical skills) or learning a trade. You may take a financial hit and you may have to just accept that. Remember the alternative is experimental genetic modification, possible infertility, etc. from which you may never recover; some tens of thousands of dollars in tuition is nothing compared to that in the long term. If you have to drop out, sue your college on the basis that your tuition payments were never made with the understading that you'd have to undergo a medical procedure: they are changing the contract. I'm sure there are lawyers chomping at the bit to take cases like this.</p>
<p>What country do you live in? If it's the US, I wouldn't worry too much about mandatory vaccination as a general rule. The fact is that US government across federal/state/local levels is too disorganized to effectively implement a far-reaching vaccination requirement. It might be required at certain places; you just need to position yourself to be able to route around it. Plan to rely on driving instead of flying, for instance, and learn skills that align your future with work environments populated by like-minded people. Find a local conservative, libertarian, or anti-lockdown/vax group and try to branch out from there to cultivate friends and business that you can rely on.</p>

        <p>They haven’t pushed it at work, but they did say we’re eligible and that we can take an extra 3 days sick pay if we have adverse reactions to the covid vaccine (lol). Honestly out here in the real world it feels much more normal than it would if I spent most of my time online and inside the house. People get vaccinated or not and don’t really bitch one way or another. Online is a completely different story. </p>
<p>When it comes to your schooling though, a lot of the benefits of the traditional college experience are completely removed by the reaction to covid, vaccine or not. I don’t think I would recommend it at this point, unless you’re gambling that it’s going to go back to normal before too long. Without the open social interaction, going away to college is basically a prison.</p>

        <p>It sounds like for now the vaccine is optional at your school. You are fortunate in that respect. While I wouldn’t get my hopes up as far as it <em>remaining</em> optional, I would see this as an opportunity to buy yourself some time. Keep your head down, don’t tell anyone that you don’t intend to get the vaccine, and above all, <strong>don’t get it</strong>.</p>
<p>If I were in your shoes, I would use this time to look into trade schools, which I would think would be much slower and less likely to adopt mandatory vaccination policies, and start learning a trade.</p>

        <p>I'm not going to suggest you get the vaccine or that you don't.</p>
<p>But consider this.  If there is no overwhelming reason that you need to get it right now, you can always get it later.</p>
<p>You can not un-get it.</p>

        <p>As someone who has a graduate degree: learn a trade instead.  Become an electrician, plumber, carpenter.  You can work up to a solid income, have your own business, and you can do work on your own home.  You can live wherever you want.</p>
<p>College is nothing but a wokefest these days anyway.  A degree can offer professional paths that you otherwise wouldn't have access to, but those don't always work out.  Nothing but frustration and debt when that happens.</p>
<p>Above all of that - buy property.  Own something - a chunk of land, a house, something.  Real estate offers opportunities to either level up financially or have a place that is yours.</p>
