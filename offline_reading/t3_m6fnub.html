    <strong>Obedience</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to give some perspective to those who continue to blame their fellow brothers and sisters for what is happening today. Covid or no covid, mask or no mask, I'm pretty sure we can all agree that the human condition and current state of affairs on this planet is an absolute mess. Frankly, we should be appalled, ashamed and disgusted with ourselves.</p>
<p>Can we please stop blaming each other and pointing the finger at others? When we point a finger there's 3 fingers pointing back at us. It's time to admit our wrongs and begin the healing process. No healing will take place unless we are capable of accepting personal responsibility for what has transpired here on earth.<br>
We need to own it, look in the mirror and face the biggest enemy we've ever faced .  We are all equally to blame for the nonsense and injustice that continues to ruin people's lives.  It's not like we were strumming along living heaven on earth when suddenly we fall into a state of despair. Actually, we've been here for thousands of years. Covid is simply the catalyst that should serve as a wake up call. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>Life on this earth isn't the way it is because 1% of people use their volition and do what they want. It's an absolute shit hole because 99% of people give up their will and do what they're told.</p></p>

        <p>Government is to blame. It’s their hoax and a poorly executed one at that. If it’s real, then it’s a bio weapon they are using against us. Either way they are the problem.</p>

        <p>but how in the world to do it? I try tp be chill but for example a loved one , who had been anti- , flipped on vax, and I tey to just hope for the best after I expressed my opinion, but good lord they have to keep pushing it, almost hysterically, probably because that the only reason they did it was the pressure. I asked to please just stop talkimg about it all the time theres other things to talk about, but I guess not to them. I think they want validation from me, to 'forgive' them by saying it was good they got it, but I just cant go that extra step, I really dont like the coercian they did to get them to do it,  and having seen side effects in others I'm terrified they will have them too. 
I dont know what to do, now they have cut down their talking to me to about 10% of what was previously, I dont know how to make it right. Genuinely looking for advice as to how to deal with it and put things right, they are so important to me</p>

        <p>Really, I loce this person so much I would sacrifice my life for them, I just feel like this would be a ridiculus and false sacrifice, to take the vaccine just to appease them when they know I have problems, or even just to tell them are right when i so strongly disagree. I feel like this has made them a different person in some respects</p>
