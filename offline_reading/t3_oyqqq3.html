<title>Similar to how antibiotics can select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria, I was wondering about this also happening with vaccines. Apparently, there was research into this pre-pandemic that suggests vaxed could be just as responsible for variant spread even though unvaxed are first to be blamed.</title>

        <p>Here's a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/leaky-vaccines-can-produce-stronger-versions-of-viruses-072715">study</a> somebody posted in this sub just yesterday, I believe.</p>
<p>The variants all seemed to show up after we started vaccinating, and reading the study seems to say the vaccines could cause Covid to become much, much deadlier if they react the same as other virusses do to 'leaky' vaccines.</p>
<p>Of course, you'll never hear them admit on MSM media that vaccinating people made covid much deadlier and more dangerous than if we had simply done nothing.  If that turns out to be the case, it will probably only be admitted to 50 years from now.  I think then they will reporting how the mishandling of disease caused a global disaster.</p>
<p>I think it would have been much wiser to hold off on the vaccine and see if the death rate declined after the first year (because the disease had probably spread through out the population and killed off the susceptible by that time and everyone had by now come into contact with it and we had reached herd immunity).  Adding vaccines into play probably changed the game for the worse.</p>
<p>The Spanish Flu was never vaccinated against - it simply went away the next year as the flu virus mutated into a less deadly form.</p>

        <p>blaming unvaxxed is just a stunt they have pulled to try and put more pressure on people to become part of the experiment and get the useful idiots all frothy at the mouth and doing their dirty work for them whilst hiding the fact that the treatments are useless</p>

        <p>If the covid vaccines are leaky(and probably is) and the virus really mutates to something stronger, it'll really force vaccination of infants. But I guess most people genuinely don't care.</p>

        <p>The "vaccine" is not a vaccine. Its instructions to tell your bodys cells how to produce the spike protein, which your body then reacts to with the immune system. It MIGHT reduce your symptoms if you contract covid but it doesnt give you immunity and there is no long term safety data on this type of experimental drug.</p>
