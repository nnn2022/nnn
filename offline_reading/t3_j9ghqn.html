        <p>I view New York as very similar to LA. I feel like a lot of people move there to “follow their dreams” and wind up in the same situation before they arrived.</p>

        <p>New Yorker here- I’m fucking disgusted with everyone wearing masks all the time. I actually started going around without one- I accidentally walked outside and felt amazing, couldn’t figure out why, then realized it was because I was breathing oxygen freely. Never went back.</p>
<p>If my industry (entertainment) was anywhere else I’d go- heading to a shoot in LA next week, where I hear it is even more draconian. Oh well. Rental market’s looking great got a sweet deal on a 2BR way below market.</p>

        <p>So I'm a NYC transplant.  I came here for career reasons.  A majority of the people in NYC are not native New Yorkers.  Why?  Because it's an overpriced shithole.    </p>
<p>To have a reasonable commute and a 1 bedroom apartment that isn't dilapidated, roach infested, etc, you can easily pay $4000 a month or more (cheaper places exist but you have to compromise on something).  And these apartments tend to be very small compared to everywhere else in the USA and also lack amenities that everyone takes for granted (like a garbage disposal, dishwasher, air conditioning, washer &amp; dryer, or a gym).    </p>
<p>The tax rates are outrageous.  I am not a 1%er but I still paid ~43% of my gross salary to the government last year.  In exchange for these taxes I receive generous government services, such as ~~reliable, safe, and clean public transportation~~ ... oh wait no.  The subways are literally shit in by homeless people and haven't been updated in decades.  They rarely run on time and you often are crammed in so tight that you can't even move your arms (let alone read a book or sit or something).    </p>
<p>The reason everyone says New Yorkers are tough is because it's so obnoxious.  If you can manage to land a job in one of the many competitive industries based here and put up with all of the negatives ... then you can probably make it anywhere (as the song goes).

        <p>I’m based in NYC. The city is literally dead, a filth-hole and surreal since the lockdowns with very few exceptions for some neighborhoods. It baffles me how they describe a dead city as “tough”— it’s not even alive. It’s extremely saddening to see the state of the city now, every little detail that makes the city lively is entirely decimated by its inept “leadership”. And above all of that, there’s no light at the end of the tunnel to see it back on its feet. Many NYers are also complacent in the excessive cringeworthy virtue-signaling behavior giving its leadership more reason to keep nullifying the city.</p>

        <p>What a shocking allegation! Have you not noticed all the "heroes" of New York cowering like children and wearing t-shirts on their faces? How dare you not salute their toughness?! These are the men your daughters are going to marry. Lol. /s</p>
<p>Heroes everywhere! In old-fashioned times a hero was willing to lay down their life to save others but today, they sit at home and masturbate heroically. Reddit is full of these people and they are all without a doubt the bravest wankers ever to have walked the face of the planet. How dare you suggest otherwise, sir?</p>

        <p>"Heroes", the word has had all the meaning sucked out of it by government/media propaganda.</p>
<p>I remember, first it was 9/11, all police and firemen were "heroes".  Actually I've got mad respect for firefighters, and those police who are actually heroic.  But writing parking or speeding tickets?  Busting pot smokers? Not a "hero".</p>
<p>Then it was the endless wars... every single soldier was a "hero".  Just putting on a uniform doesn't make you a "hero" - but saying it does cheapens the achievements of those who actually did something heroic.</p>
<p>Now it's the doctors, nurses, and EMTs.  Again, much respect. But they're not automatically "heroes", though it serves the lockdown strategy to say so.  It was such a blatant replay of the wartime propaganda.</p>
<p>Sorry, pet peeve of mine.</p>

        <p>I agree. It's an image they tried to put on, and coast off tough groups like the Mafia and immigrants who came there and worked hard. And the minority businesses that set up food stands working 14 hours a day to provide food to a growing city. But the white virtue signaling liberals who infected that city are the opposite of what the city was built on. </p>
<p>They are the ones who voted in people like De Blasio and Cuomo and they are ones now who are fleeing because of the garbage pile they created. The contrast between who was there say 50 years ago and who is there now is telling. It was flooded with hipsters, artsy fartsy people, and ultra liberals who believe in fascist authoritarianism as long as it fits their agenda.</p>

        <p>A few things,</p>
<p>1) NY is/has long been an arts and entertainment hub.  Those fields have, unfortunately, been taken over by TDS-addled, wannabe-communist, SJW douchebags who love to flock to each other and create toxic echo chambers where they do nothing but jerk each other off, and scream "FUCK TRUMP!" while they cum on each others faces, because pwning le orang man is the only meaningful thing in any of their lives any more.</p>
<p>2) Lots and lots of young people with no marketable skills and no work ethic are moving into "hip" neighborhoods with mommy and daddy's credit card.  For the last 20 years, they've lived in the shadow of garbage helicopter parents, and pushover school administrators who will bend over and spread for anybody with a sob story and a checkbook.  They are suddenly discovering that it takes <em>work</em> to climb the ladder, that real life is expensive, and that when you're on your own, if you shirk your responsibilities, nobody is going to be there to pick up after you.  They crave overbearing micromanagement because they never learned how to manage themselves.  So, when an opportunity comes along for the government to nanny them, hand them free money for doing nothing, and <em>applaud</em> them, claiming that they're being heroes and saving lives by sitting on their couch being a useless sack of shit, of course they're going to jump all over it and want to keep it going forever.</p>
<p>3) NYC <em>did</em> get hit hard and early, by virtue of being an int'l travel hub and densely populated.  Cuomo made it even worse by tossing COVID patients in nursing homes and throwing every jerkoff who walked into the hospital on a murderator, driving up the death rates early on.  A lot of people fell for the panic (which was quite valid if you took all the information you received at face value) back then, but then never bothered keeping up.   They don't realize that now, 7 months later, the whole thing has become nothingburger, symptom treatment has gotten better and the most vulnerable populations have already had the virus and either recovered (with immunity) or, unfortunately, died.</p>
<p>But on the whole, yes, it is hilarious watching these people clutch at straws, trying desperately to justify continuing to pay thousands of dollars per month to live in a run-down, rat-infested 120-year-old studio shithole the size of a milk carton.  Any reason that once existed to live in the city, especially Manhattan, is long gone.  Close to work?  Everyone is WFH or unemployed now.  Arts and entertainment scene? Dead.  Broadway?  Dead.  Dining and drinking?  Slowly being suffocated.  Shopping?  All the interesting stores are closing, but have fun deciding whether you want to go to the Duane Reade on this corner or the one a block away.  Meeting new people, socializing, etc?  Can't do that while everyone is locked up in their apartment cowering in fear at the idea of seeing another human face in public.  The veneer has been scrubbed off and the city is being exposed for the dirty, crowded, noisy, lawless hellscape that it truly is.  </p>
<p>I'm a musician, I'm New York (state) born and raised, everyone kept telling me all through college and after college that I "belong" in the city, I'm so glad I never fell for it.  Life in the country (lake life for me, in fact) is infinitely better and cheaper.</p>

<p>HAHA. You've got me laughing so hard and lord knows we need to laugh. You're a fantastic writer and remind me a bit of my favorite writer David Cole who writes for TakiMag.</p>
<p>I lived in NYC for almost 10 years and agree with you 100%. Most of my friends who still lived in NYC when this thing took off in March left. Most are living on their ranches in California and Colorado, one moved to Puerto Rico and another is living in the Hamptons.</p>
<p>NYC is targeted for a smart city.</p>
<p>They want to bankrupt the entire place and push everyone out so Central Bankers can buy everything up on the cheap and start from scratch to build the 'Brave New World' style city. Check asout the show on Peacock/BBC to understand their fantasy completely.</p>
<p>Before NYC, I lived in the Middle East and in Orange County, but I was born in the Midwest.</p>
<p>I moved out of the city and back to the Midwest and am living on a lake. Life is good here even though we have a psychotic evil Governor, but most people I know ignore the monster and do what they want.</p>
