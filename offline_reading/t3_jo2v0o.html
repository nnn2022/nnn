    <strong>The Future</strong>
    <p><p>December 5, 2027</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'And that is the story of our current world' the man said at his illegal dinner party, his smoking jacket and face dimly visible above the light of the candle lantern, outside it was snowing, but no one could see a thing, for the electricity was off and blackout curtains in the windows, the doors had been barricaded.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'It's easy to forget about the police state' a man said, to which the host replied 'Well at least there's the ocassional escape, haha, my house, after all, the doomers be gone!' </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Suddenly an electronic noise rang out, and a ghostly light appeared in the room, the hosts face changed 'Who Left their phone on!?!' </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There it sat, in the middle of the table</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'COVID-19 EXPOSURE NOTIFICATION' It read, it was silent.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One of the regulars spoke up, 'Well, what's going to happen now?' </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'I think we shou-' but the host was cut-off mid-sentance, as loud sirens suddenly activated outside, and then a window, and then a door, both burst asunder.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'ARMED POLICE WITH A DOG' Shouted a mysterious yet potent force.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'GET TO THE ROOF NOW!' Shouted the host, before he ran, his guests followed, up the stairs, and running down the dark hallways of the mansion, they found the loft hatch but couldn't get it open, 'GET TO THE LOFT NOW' 'TO THE LOFT NOW' at least one guest opened it and ran up, before a light so bright blinded the group.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Loud bangs went off as the host was knocked to the floor, he was handcuffed</p>
<p>'You are currently under arrest for social virus endangerment and for performing a traditional activity' 'Under section REDACTED of the coronavirus bill all tradition activies are prohibited' </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The many people who sat close around the table were forcibly masked, then bundled into seperate police vans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Each a minimum sentance of 4 years, the host was released after five, but his house had mysteriously burnt down, been demolished and replaced with Amazon offices.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Farewell the rich english aristocrat said as he jumped into the river, the last of the true brits, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>His ghost now haunts the same amazon offices, and in 2035, a message appeared on a computer monitor</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>'Never shall what you read be the future, act now, may the new normal be abolished'</p></p>
