    <strong>A Respectful Discussion</strong>
    <p><p>Hello NNN,</p>
<p>I want to share with you all, a conversation that I had with one of my close friends. I realize that sharing this here will likely only yield responses that agree with my opinion, but I would ask for anyone who reads this in its entirety, please point out any flaws in my reasoning. I posed the following question:</p>
<p><em>I want to start a healthy discussion about the idea of vaccine passports. This is something that I thought would take many years to reach the US, but now it seems like it could be just months away. Based on the recent events in other countries (France, Canada, UK, Australia) and the overall tone of our country, it almost seems inevitable at this point. So I ask, what is your honest opinion? Here are some questions to help guide you (no need to answer them):</em></p>
<p><em>Is it something we need in this country? What would be the goal of enforcing a policy like that? Should we consider any unknown (long-term) side effects of the mRNA jab? Do the risks (known and unknown) associated with the mRNA jab outweigh its benefits? What are the benefits of the mRNA jab? Are there other ways to accomplish the goal of a vaccine passport policy?</em></p>
<p>For the sake of organization, I will label my friends responses as K and my responses as ME.</p>
<p><strong>K:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hmmm I mean in terms of just things being closed out to you because of not being vaccinated, you essentially can't go to school if you aren't vaccinated for like polio and such, generally.</em></p>
<p><em>And with the WHO card stuff for like yellow fever vaccinations and what have you when you travel abroad, we already do it. The only thing that's really changing is the level of enforcement.</em></p>
<p><em>But aye health, personal freedoms, public safety</em></p>
<p><em>I'm kinda already decided because I'm vaccinated so it don't make me much difference either way. Although I'm for the way it incentivizes people to vaccinate. Which again we kind of do because you literally can't enroll kids into like 90% of schools without having certain vaccinations.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hey, thanks for taking the time to comment.</em></p>
<p><em>To be clear, I have no issues with any other vaccinations. I was mandated to take a few before I could live on campus at [the college we both attended]. That being said, I think we should avoid comparing those to the gene-based vaccine that is being presented to us now (I think the reasons for not making the comparison are obvious, but LMK if you'd like me to elaborate).</em></p>
<p><em>Now when you say "...because I'm vaccinated so it don't make me much difference anyway", does that mean you don't care what happens to unvaccinated people, since it won't affect you? Please correct me if I'm wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Would you support a vaccine passport if your friends who choose not to receive the vaccine started losing basic freedoms (far beyond travel restrictions)?</em></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong></p>
<p><em>Aye I hear don't know the long term effects. Don't trust the whole immune system creating proteins, I get it.</em></p>
<p><em>I'm gonna compare the vaccines because I believe the stigma is similar and comes from that same place. And the results and outcomes of the antivax ideology is very much the same.</em></p>
<p><em>You can take the "don't make much difference" in it's worse context if you want. We can both do the "do you care about people" game with like contributing to herd immunity and not caring about variants or deaths yada yada yada.</em></p>
<p><em>Basic freedoms is stretch but we can go down the same hypothetical rabbit hole both ways. variants gets strong or some kind of ebola-esque virus happens or even if ebola happened to get on our shores what then? Like we both can do the likely/not likely hypothetical rabbit whole.</em></p>
<p><em>But should someone lose the right to vote (of course they can mail in), bear arms, freedom of speech, the right to due process under the law because they are unvaccinated, No.</em></p>
<p><em>Will you have to wear a mask at a large event or store, maybe not get to work with kids, the infirm or elderly if not vaccinated. You willing to gamble with their lives.</em></p>
<p><em>But I hear you, if the deaths aren't really caused by the virus and it's as bad as they say then it's gambling with your freedoms. getting polio, flu vaccines, is gambling with giving your kids autism.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong></p>
<p><em>I'm not too well informed on the whole antivax ideology so I can't really comment on any association between vaccines and autism, but I digress. I choose not to compare the types vaccines (when discussing formal vaccine passports) because of the unknown side effects (short-term and long term) that gene-based vaccines might produce.</em></p>
<p><em>We already know some of the short-term side effects and this is just from the first round of shots, there will be more from the inevitable "boosters". Say what you will about the number of adverse reactions being minimal, because those numbers aren't really being reported at all and are not minimal enough to dismiss.</em></p>
<p><em>The other main reason I choose not to compare the vaccines is because frankly, this one doesn't seem to be very effective. Mr. Fauci (since he's the main man) just said himself that "breakthrough cases" in vaccinated individuals are still passing this virus on to other people .Hence why even vaccinated individuals are being instructed to wear masks again. I am hoping that this will, at the very least, put an end to the incessant virtue signaling.</em></p>
<p><em>The vaccinated and the unvaccinated are both spreading the virus, there is no virtue in signing up to take this shot. That idea is pure indoctrination through eighteen months of nonstop sensational journalism and fear mongering. You suppose that by doing your part and getting vaccinated, that you are "stopping the spread" and contributing to herd immunity - but Fauci just said that's all wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>The main question we should all really be asking now is how accurate our COVID testing has been. The FDA will be withdrawing their EUA for the PCR tests due to significant risks of false positives and their inability to distinguish between COVID and influenza. The point I'm trying to make is that I choose not to compare this vaccine to others because of the overwhelming amount of contradicting information.</em></p>
<p><em>We can agree to disagree about the safety and efficacy of the gene-based vaccine, but I will never yield to the idea of this cult-like obsession with getting every single person vaccinated nor will I accept any policies that promote said idea.</em></p>
<p><em>Just so we're clear on something, I have never and will never try to stop someone from taking the shot, that's not my aim. I would rather help us understand each other because following a "blame the unvaccinated" narrative is incredibly ignorant and toxic. The laws for these passports are being written and will most likely be passed in other countries this Fall. You say losing basic freedoms is a stretch but like Dan said, I think we've got a lot worse coming. I urge you to investigate what is happening in countries like Canada, France and Australia because it is essentially a spoiler alert for the US.</em></p>
<p><em>When I start to see increasing amounts of headlines and news articles like these:(-Removed Link- "Blame the unvaccinated article")and then watch my good friends and family members adhere to that type of narrative, it motivates me to do something. That's why I started this discussion because I know I am talking amongst a group of good men and I know when push comes to shove, that you guys will do the right thing.</em></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong></p>
<p><em>I hear that. again it's a value system and what you believe is true.</em></p>
<p><em>If we go down the logic of transmission is transmission vaccine or no vaccine it doesn't effect death rates if it's even covid deaths, it could be influenza.</em></p>
<p><em>Like, I get it. the idea you can't go to a restaurant, a return lockdown, individual freedoms. For a vaccine that's not effective to you. Why would I want to do that. I'd definitely want to fight against that.</em></p>
<p><em>I'd say if it's not stopping transmission but at least preventing severe symptoms than we're at, are deaths even covid.</em></p>
<p><em>we go down the train of thought and I see preventing deaths. You see preventing freedoms.</em></p>
<p><em>And I understand you not being familiar with antivax stuff but ideology is similar, don't know what's in there, these unknown effect, I aint seen nobody die from polio. Why are you forcing my kids to get this and it might be making them autistic I have a right to decide what to do with my child. (Forget the fact it's bringing the disease back making other kids sick, and letting the virus adapt because it gets to spread)</em></p>
<p><em>You say do the right thing, I'm like how many deaths until it's real. What's the degrees of separation on death do you need before the health of the community is your primary concern.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong></p>
<p><em>So let me ask a genuine question then, what do you believe is true?</em></p>
<p><em>You say "if we go down the logic of transmission is transmission vaccine or no vaccine"- but why would we not go with that logic when that is literally what Dr. Fauci is saying? Do we selectively choose to believe only certain things that he says?</em></p>
<p><em>You say "if we go down the logic...if it's even COVID deaths, it could be influenza" - why would we not go with that logic when PCR tests are being recalled for their inability to distinguish between COVID and influenza (-Removed Link-). Do we just choose to ignore/forget certain things that the CDC/FDA do?</em></p>
<p><em>You ask me, "how many deaths until it's real?" and I ask you how many of the deaths were real? How many deaths were "mistakenly" classified as COVID simply because the PCR tests were inaccurate. Please don't get me started on the health of the community, because that is the absolute last thing that these people care about. Offering up free donuts, beer, weed and money just to convince them to get the shot? Please.</em></p>
<p><em>The main point I am trying to discuss here (vaccine passports) actually has no relation whatsoever to the antivax ideology that you keep going back to. Comparing Polio to COVID is a moot point because the vaccine for Polio actually works. As I said before, I am not trying to stop anyone and I will support their decision either way. I am simply asking if you will show the same respect and support for individuals who choose not to get the vaccine. Do you blame the unvaccinated? What do you believe is true, brother?</em></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong></p>
<p><em>nahh it is, very similar to antivax ideology.</em></p>
<p><em>and I bring up the line of thinking because I know exactly where it leads nothing is ever going to be enough until you touch the death with your own hands.</em></p>
<p><em>We can go down the transmission stuff ignoring it prevents severe symptoms then it's is it even those symptoms that killing people. It's all influenza. again nothing will ever be enough</em></p>
<p><em>I can for arguments sake take everything you say is true until we get to what to do to prevent deaths, and that just boils down to there are no deaths or not as severe as reported because it's the only way to justify some measure of mitigation. and the degree you feel about the severity of the disease and deaths correlate to how strongly you feel about wearing a mask on the low spectrum to getting vaccinated on the higher level of concern despite side effect misgivings.</em></p>
<p><em>Like I said, i get what you're putting down.</em></p>
<p><em>It all leads to the same impasse of you don't believe Covid is that big of a concern and I do.</em></p>
<p><em>You don't think the death toll is real. I do and I don't think the human lives are worth the risk. and I'll even go with the overblown for arguments sake say 25% of deaths attributed to covid aren't covid that's still alot of deaths what then.</em></p>
<p><em>But we're doing different calculus and I've been pretty clear all the way through with what I believe. It's not hard to figure out. but I'll be more straightforward</em></p>
<p><em>I think unvaccinated people cause more deaths and I don't support not getting the vaccine.</em></p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong></p>
<p><em>Thanks for your input, K!</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I wanted to end it there because any further discussion would probably just be a persuasive battle. He firmly believes that my concerns for vaccine passports are very similar to antivax ideology. I tried to explain to him that I'm not an anti-vaxxer, and I even support people who choose to get the mRNA jab. I am simply asking him for the same support in return, but I finally get his straight-forward opinion that he does not support refusing the vaccine.</p>
<p>I am doing my best to have this conversation with as many people as possible. If we can understand the other side better and help them understand us, that's the first step out of this mess. Thank you for anyone who made it this far and please feel free to leave your thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>All I noticed is K will fall back into circular logic, and hold up "Even one death is too many" as a shield.</p>
<p>Traditional vaccines kill people, not many but it does happen. So that is a moot point. And trying to group people against COVAX into the same group as anti-vaccine supporters makes for a very nice broad target.</p>
<p>Every time you tried to isolate the conversation he brought up the same broad nonsense argument.</p>
<p>And since he is vaccinated he doesn't want to have to question his own decision so consciously or not he will avoid anything that goes there, and fall back to circular logic.</p>
<p>It is the same as when I will push someone saying "You support tyranny by agreeing with the French government's actions", most of the time it will default to "Just get the jab and you wouldn't have a problem" or degenerates to insults.</p>
<p>I commend you for trying, but unless you land on someone who is self-aware enough to question their own choices, and openly admit it, you'll probably get one version or another of K's response, or it will devolve.</p>
<p>We are seeing the "mainstream" narrative start to degenerate already. The mask mandates coming back is ruining the "You'll be free if you get the injection" message, and in the case of France there are plenty of people who were fine with the idea of getting the injection, and got it, but said "No" when the government declared they will use coercion to get "everyone vaccinated".</p>

        <p>Yeah, his main defense seems to be (a) passports are necessary because they save lives and (b) your arguments are invalid because you believe in antivax ideologies.  </p>
<p>I failed to help him recognize the difference between (1) being completely anti-vax (ie: no one should ever get a vaccine) (2) being anti-COVAX specifically and (3) being pro-vax, even pro COVAX but opposed to the idea of vaccine passports.</p>
<p>Still even despite that, I'm astonished by his black/white view towards vaccination. I suppose he does admit that:</p>
<p><em>"...should someone lose the right to vote (of course they can mail in), bear arms, freedom of speech, the right to due process under the law because they are unvaccinated, No."</em></p>
<p>So maybe he is more on the fence than he actually believes to be. I know I didn't sway his opinion but maybe this conversation will make him question things a little more critically. That's all I can hope for!</p>

        <p>Why don't we force everyone to lose weight and jog 5 miles per day?  If it's really about the "health of the community" cardiovascular problems and heart issues are killing millions more people than Covid-19 ever will.  </p>
<p>The real answer is because it's not about healthy living or caring about your fellow man, it's about power and control of the state.  I would support the State forcing people to eat well and exercise daily, before I would support forcing people to take experimental drugs.</p>

        <p>Yes, unfortunately healthy people leading healthy lives is the exact opposite of what pharmaceutical companies want to see happen. If everyone is healthy, then nobody will have the need for any of their drugs. I bet it would be pretty tough to sell anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds when people figure out that consistent healthy diet/exercise will alleviate those issues in most cases.</p>
