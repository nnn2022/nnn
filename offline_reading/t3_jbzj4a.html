        <p>Everywhere you read/hear of hospitals &amp; nursing homes being incentivized (by substantial payments) to classify *any* death as from the "scary virus". There is a concerted effort to massively inflate the death count of this scamdemic. That CDC data as shown is just confirmation of this institutionalized collusion. Everywhere you look there is corruption in the highest places. For some reason, governments are hell bent on destroying their own economies in the name of this "scary virus" <a href="https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-virus">https://soundcloud.com/getout_mc/scary-virus</a>  Like anything, it must be related to money. Who benefits from destroying western economies? And further, why are people SO stupid and trusting in governments and agencies that have proven track records of corruption? Instead of "religion being the opiate of the masses" it is now stark rabid fear which is being used. And most people seem to be falling for this crap (just see all the muzzle wearers). If people will continue to be this stupid, then civilization deserves to fall.</p>

        <p>Excellent post! It is not related to money, although the 4th industrial revolution and the climate change hoax will unleash trillions in spending from pension fund money, the goal of the great reset is depopulation... Socialism/Communism will be used to destroy growth, massive governments with authoritarian features and slowly depopulate, limit the consumption of carbon fuel and finite resources for the majority of the world.</p>
<p>They want to create a system where government dependence dramatically increases, like you are currently witnessing in Canada... Completely obliterate the service industry, tourism industry and a few others in the name of your " safety " for a virus with a survival rate of 99.97 % under 70 years old... They then turn around and offer those same people 1800 a month tax free to stay at home, clean out small-private business owners and slowly kill off the medium ones, make big public companies become oligopolies.</p>
<p>Once oligopolies are formed, create laws enabling that governments can invest and own public or private companies, like klaus schwab just so happens to mention in his great reset article he wrote, and you have governments owning literally everything if you include state owned companies that exist in socialist/communist governments.</p>
<p>Have faith in humans, many are stupid, but they still deserve to live and not be depopulated.</p>

        <p>Seems more like a legal argument that the CDC data is flawed rather than a scientific study. Not saying that’s a bad thing, but that’s what my skimming senses gave me.</p>
<p>Seemed to cite very well, but yeah author definitely sounded like he was making a indictment, rather than a neutral toned scientific paper.</p>

        <p>Just FYI this isn’t a study at all. It’s a poorly written policy paper. Don’t put this kind of crap on here and act like it’s a scientific study. Its disingenuous and doesn’t help our cause. </p>
<p>Authors affiliations are not major universities or medical centers. They are shitty think tanks:</p>
<p>“Metabolic Healing Institute?” “Climate change truth?”</p>
<p>Trust me this paper is a joke and don’t use it as evidence to support your claims. Find data. Actual science. Opinion pieces like this hold no water at all. </p>
<p>It seriously reads like it was written as a high school term paper. And not a good one either.</p>

        <p>Ya but what I’m saying is it wouldn’t even matter if everything they said were true, the paper is an opinion piece. It’s written by nobodies, from institutions no one has ever heard of that no one is going to listen to. It should not be used as “evidence” for anything. </p>
<p>It’s like if a prolockdown guy gave a talk to a bunch of old people on why lockdowns were vital, but his only source was an opinion piece from the New York Times, </p>
<p>Except it wasn’t even an opinion piece from the New York Times this is the like the Fresno town crier free handout written by hippies. No one is ever going to take this seriously. </p>
<p>We need real data. Not opinion pieces- I don’t care if it has linked sources.</p>

        <p>at worst, this paper is pointing to what we already knew in a nicer way with more references than the articles one might use before like this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/08/shock-report-week-cdc-quietly-updated-covid-19-numbers-9210-americans-died-covid-19-alone-rest-serious-illnesses/">https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/08/shock-report-week-cdc-quietly-updated-covid-19-numbers-9210-americans-died-covid-19-alone-rest-serious-illnesses/</a> </p>
<p>this has certainly value and is for us nothing new of course, but expressed this well makes it certainly easier for people to digest, well hopefully actually.</p>

        <p>I disagree this paper is a mess to read. It looks unprofessional and will do nothing positive for our cause. </p>
<p>We need better “evidence” than this. Just my two cents as a medical professional who reads the medical literature every day. </p>
<p>This kind of stuff will never get noticed and more importantly won’t change anyone’s mind. </p>
<p>I’m sick of being us being labeled as conspiracy theorists. It’s because we latch on to crappy non-mainstream articles like this. It’s not necessary because there are tons of mainstream pieces of evidence out there. And opinion pieces by people who’s opinion actually matters. We need to have higher standards.</p>

        <p>i would say, that both need to be targeted, the well read person, who reads tons of studies, doctors, nurses, researchers, etc...</p>
<p>BUT   the broad public, who actually won't understand studies on the first read, because they have never read one i their entire life will be very hard to reach by them.</p>
<p>dr. andrew wakefield actually made the excellent case, that documentaries can be way more powerful than peer reviewed research. (they should of course contain some peer reviewed research though ;)</p>
<p>vaxxed the documentary for example had a  massive impact, way more impact than any peer reviewed study in regards to vaccine safety.</p>
<p>in regards to spreading awareness using emotional bits grounded in facts can be very powerful and should be used.</p>
<p>the one thing, that needs to be avoided at all costs is the use of false information and linking it. an example of easy to prove disinformation would be the video, that gets talked about in this corbettreport video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/fact-check-bill-gates-and-the-god-gene-vaccine/">https://www.corbettreport.com/fact-check-bill-gates-and-the-god-gene-vaccine/</a> </p>
<p>linking this "god gene" easy to prove wrong garbage to friends and colleges will result in people  rightfully dismissing it as easy to prove wrong  bullshit and those people will never trust anything you say again and never look at it again.</p>
<p>in the case of the 6% for the cdc fake death numbers, that can be easily looked at at their own website, although it is quite hidden ;) so that is a wonderful thing to link to people through decently written articles or directly to the CDC website stating it.</p>
<p>so avoiding disinformation,  proper researching ourselves and using the right information for the right people should be our strategy in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Dude, I see you on here alot and I like your posts. I am curious as to why you feel you need to be a dick like this if you disagree with the findings. Be civil at least. A good source I follow on twitter (@Milhouse_Van_Ho - give him a follow if you're Canadian) posted it and I thought it would make for an interesting discussion here. I never said scientific, published or peer reviewed so I don't know why you feel the need to jump on me like this for a post I made in good faith.</p>

        <p>I understand you made the post in good faith. I’m not asking you to take it down. Any discussion is probably better than none- you are right. </p>
<p>My problem is I know exactly what the Doomers think when they see us talking about articles like this that claim the actual death toll is actually 9600 or whatever. They label us as conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>Cause literally every single person at the CDC would have to be in on this. And it goes against everything I have seen in my daily practice. </p>
<p>The truth is, we don’t NEED the numbers to be any lower. They are already ridiculously low.</p>

        <p>I understand what you're saying and I respect your opinion as a medical professional. I also have a limited understanding of these things as a lay person myself so I do really appreciate it when someone with the right knowledge can disseminate a claim such as this. </p>
<p>I guess I just didn't see it as a "only x amount of people died of covid so it's a hoax" kind of way; rather a "because we changed our classification system in a way we've never used before, people who would previously not have been listed as dying from this virus, rather an underlying condition or something else entirely, have been noted as such for the first time ever" kind of way. </p>
<p>Does at least any of the sources they used indicate that accurately?</p>

        <p>This is fucking eye opening. </p>
<p>I (along with everyone else in this subreddit) already KNEW that they were overcounting Covid deaths but I had no idea they were overcounting them by a factor of 16. SIXTEEN. I thought it was a factor of 5 or 6 max. </p>
<p>That means that even if we take the total (current) deaths down to 22,000 (10% of deaths), and we only use lab confirmed cases, that this disease has a 0.3% fatality rate at the absolute highest, when compared to how we NORMALLY count deaths. </p>
<p>Then add in that we are undercounting cases because at least 80% of them are asymptomatic. We're well below 0.1% for true IFR.</p>

        <p>Would that count as someone with a preexisting condition? say diabetes or obesity? diabetes or obesity alone wouldn’t have killed them, but would contracting covid and dying count them as a non covid death? just curious on how to read this</p>

        <p>Well this isn't another one of those "only 6000 really died from covid" things. This is about how if we used the same classification for viral deaths as we have for the previous 17 years, here is how many fewer deaths from covid we'd have listed using that system.</p>
<p>The CDC changed the way things have always been done this past March 2020 just for covid. </p>
<p>For example, if someone has heart failure or a compromised immune system from cancer or it's treatments and they died after succumbing to the flu in previous years, they would have been classified of dying from the primary thing that killed them, not from the flu.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, dying with the viral infection is being noted as dying from the viral infection so there is a big difference there.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is we may have had many more flu deaths in previous years if we had used this system so it doesn't make sense that we're using this new system all of a sudden because then we're no longer comparing apples to apples, we're now comparing apples to oranges.</p>
<p>And we have no way of knowing now if this years deaths from covid are actually considerably more than from the flus because it's not an equal comparison any more.</p>
<p>We may have had 200,000 deaths from the flu last year too if we used this system but we'll never know.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the thoughtful response.</p>
<p>Honestly, I haven't looked in-depth into the topic but I have encountered people who argue these numbers are completely useless by pointing out how we measure deaths.</p>
<p>I do think the CDC needs to be more transparent and honest about why they changed these guidelines. There's no perfect way to measure what caused someone's death. It's often multi-factoral.</p>

        <p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think in usa hospitals get money for Rona patients. Since many elective procedures (elective can mean that elbow surgery that keeps someone from becoming crippled) were/are on hold, hospitals lost a lot of money. Some hospitals are cutting hours or reducing staff bc the work isnt there, hence why some nurses have time to twerk on tiktok.</p>

        <p>I would guess the decisions would be more political and not well thought out. Back in March people were so sure hospitals would be overrun with Cv19 patients. I'd love to head from someone with intimate knowledge of hospitals. The best I can come up with is mass hysteria around cv19.</p>
<p>It seems like if someone had an ailment other than Rona, they were likely put on the back burner.</p>
<p>I agree 100% that all electives should be resumed if they haven't been already. Unfortunately, for some the damage is already done. It's crazy how some young people will be permanently disabled. Rona can have effects, but what about the effects of not having timely hip surgery?</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ, this all holds up. This is what the first cited handbook on cause of death requires:</p>
<p>&rt;A properly completed cause-of-death section provides an etiological explanation of the order, type, and association of events resulting in death. The initial condition that starts the etiological sequence is specific if it does not leave any doubt as to why it developed. For instance, sepsis is not specific because a number of different conditions may have resulted in sepsis, whereas Human immunodeficiency virus infection is specific.</p>

        <p>What about the 280k excess deaths though. Then the argument that covid deaths are overcounted falls kinda flat, or is it just a coincidence 280k people died more than avg</p>

        <p>(That's assuming that there actually are an excess deaths and not another news distortion. )</p>
<p>It's easy to theorize why:</p>
<p>-young people not getting timely medical  interventions to treat ailments like cancer</p>
<p>-Big Rona is killing people who were fat or hardcore smokers before they had a heart attack or stroke and got the medical interventions that would follow. It's a free country, and people can make their own choices. In my opinion these arent good choices, but the person has the right to make them.</p>
