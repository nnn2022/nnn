        <p><strong>MARK OF THE BEAST IS HERE</strong></p>
<p>&rt; He causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, 17 <strong>so that no one may buy or sell, except he who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name.</strong></p>
<p>The issue of how to "motivate" vaccine compliance has generated increasing interest, with commentators such as Mike Cernovich writing: "Government won’t force you to take vaccine. Amazon will. Airlines will. Banks will. <strong>You won’t be able to buy, sell, or trade without the vaccine."</strong></p>
<p>As if underscoring Cernovich's words, Dr. Zimlichman told the committee: "Another thing that will apparently come into our lives, starting in small numbers already in January which is soon, and that's the vaccine.</p>
<p>"If we're discussing how to create motivation for Israeli citizens to vaccinate, I agree, you can't force the population; it won't work. We can talk about it until tomorrow, it won't work.</p>
<p>"What is possible is to create motivation. Whoever is vaccinated will automatically receive 'green status'. Therefore, you may vaccinate, and receive Green Status to go freely in all the green zones: They'll open for you cultural events, they'll open to you the shopping malls, hotels, and restaurants.</p>
<p>"You may decide you're not vaccinating, and if you do want to enter these areas you'll need to submit to a PCR test, and therefore I believe people will understand by themselves that the vaccine will return them to regular life and they'll vaccinate themselves, without our obligating them.</p>
<p>"But the idea we're putting out is actually something that's starting already now, and we're floating an initial pilot we're testing and are ready to start with, based on the PCR and based on antigen, assuming it will be authored by the Health Ministry, we're in the process with the Ministry, and of course serology, and very quickly, already from January to add the vaccines - whoever is vaccinated may enter those green areas, that 'safe zone'.</p>
<p>"Assuming we're discussing a protracted period when part of the population will be vaccinated and part won't, for a year even, we see those areas growing in size, and those people who are vaccinated receive the pass to enter those green areas in the cities from the south to the north of the country."</p>

        <p>Fear not my fellow Americans. This is detestable, sure. </p>
<p>But there is a way to upset this. Become homeless on purpose; or be ready in a moment to be homeless. Why? Because we have become slaves to consumerism and luxuries. It owns us, which is why they dangle these things like candy before us. </p>
<p>Hear me out...</p>
<p>Get a very high quality rucksack or hiking pack. 
Put your basic of food, water, shelter, and security in that bag. </p>
<p>When they’ve taken it all from you, welcome to being a free man. And once this empire of lies falls, you can step right back in and claim your throne as a free man under God. </p>
<p>I know this sounds crazy. But it’s better to be ready for this and have your basic needs met by your own hand than to find yourself without anything just because you couldn’t go without luxuries. </p>
<p>Hard times create strong men. You will find allies. You will find work. You will be free. </p>
<p>I’ve often marveled at the homeless I’ve met and seen. No one is freer than they. They do not fear arrest. They do not fear the weather. They do not fear rejection. </p>
<p>Who is freer than the homeless? Take away the drug abuse or mental illnesses that often cause involuntary homelessness, and what do you have?</p>
<p>A man who belongs only to God. Not to possessions or luxury. Once you have this basic principle, your mind will be free too. </p>
<p>Get what you need now before it’s too late. Don’t gotta be a prepper to appreciate the value of being able to live out of a single bag.</p>
<p>And chances are, you can find land in the country where you can park your car and exchange work for permission to stay. Perhaps you can do chores or act as security against the roving bands of bandits that will likely exist during a depression.</p>

        <p>It’s easy. Make sure you have all the essentials in a backpack. Do not drink. Do not do drugs. This is where people usually fuck up. </p>
<p>Once you have your basic essentials met, it’s all up from there. Because you know deep down that no matter what you lose, you’re good. </p>
<p>We are so consumed with how we are perceived and how comfortable we are. It’s nice to know you can go back to being humble and be good. </p>

        <p>I mean you skipped a lot of details lol..</p>
<p>i think being 'homeless' now is a heck of a lot harder than before. before you could live out of a car, buy a gym membership to take showers, look normal, hang out in a coffee shop or library all day and get free internet and toilet and find some way to scrape by on daily food</p>
<p>but now everything is locked down and its hard to even find a place to take a shit!</p>
<p>living from a bag is nice if you actually have a way to secure it when you sleep out in the cold open. Cooking hot meals is nice if you have enough fuel (and ability to refill since the stores are closed or you dont have money to buy it) for yoru cooker.</p>
<p>Could you address how you would handle the additional burdens these lockdowns have done vs when you had to do this?</p>
