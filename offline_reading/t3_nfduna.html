    <strong>China's Win Win Solution (Covid19) : My Theory</strong>
    <p><p>In China, you can only rent property for 50 years (which was extended to 70), there is no true permanent ownership. There is no such thing as permanent private property especially extending beyond your own life. This is a communist country, of course. (( Individuals cannot privately <strong>own land in China</strong> but may obtain transferrable <strong>land</strong>-use rights for a number of <strong>years</strong> for a fee. Currently, the maximum term for urban <strong>land</strong>-use rights granted for residential purposes <strong>is</strong> seventy <strong>years</strong>. ))</p>
<p>When you think of how squished their population is with the one child policy (China is producing roughly 30 million more men than women every year since the early 2000s.), you see that a majority 95-98% of the market is held by boomers and gen xers leaving the remaining 2-5% of property and real estate to be skyrocketed in price sometimes 2000% to 5000% increases making it impossible for the younger generation to obtain private housing, to save money, to date (which is already hard with the ratio being so skewed in some areas), and there is no guarantee (just like renting from an apartment complex or high rise) they will renew your 'rental' after 70 years and if you know anything about Chinese building materials, they are shit- homes or apartments that should last 100 years are ruins in 15-20 due to poor building materials and techniques, it's generally all surface work. (source: this is just ONE of many, but I've followed this guy's channel for over almost a decade and he's one of a few great american sources of insight into how china actually works and living there from a western perspective) SO \~ IF ALL OF THE REAL ESTATE is being held by people in the 50+ age bracket, we see the youth are squished and have to pay 20-50X the property value to just rent an apartment it's rather impossible, especially with the low pay and crappy working conditions. What would solve all of this in a CLOSED COMMUNIST SYSTEM with very little wiggle room? A specially engineered virus that won't harm the children, teens, or most young adults but is severely agressive when it comes to the elderly, those suffering from comorbidities like asthma, cancer, diabetes (things most chinese boomers suffer from, esp as over 80% of 18 year olds in China smoke, Boomers and Gen Xers are usually 95% or higher when polled as smokers) </p>
<p>So a virus that leaves kids/teens/young adults (20s/30s) well enough alone, but goes after the elderly and is quite lethal with comorbidities again, esp in the elderly. Sounds like that would free up a lot of the market of real estate and allow some breathing room to lower the inflation as that 2-5% of the market that was available maybe becomes a 20%.. 30%.. gap and prices drop to afforable rates for the average communist chinese citizen. Meanwhile, if it runs rampant and fucks up everyone else, who cares? That just makes China  stronger because everyone else is burning their own house down and not paying attention to China's plans and growing dominance /influence in multiple markets (including our own universities, pharmalogical institutes, and more. Over 500 Chinese spies were arrested in 2020 under Trump in multiple fields of the government and private sector.)</p>
<p>TL;DR?</p>
<p>I believe COVID-19 was engineered as a solution to decrease pressure (social, financial) by sacrificing a large chunk of their elderly to ease market tensions and free up funds (eldercare, retirement funds) and as a side benefit causing the rest of the world to go into chaos and lose market value due to panic, chaos, loss, businesses closing, etc. And they used the WHO (which they control) to misdirect and play 'look over here' while allowing it to be released and spread from the Wuhan Lab. And Fauci knew that was a possibility due to lax security for level 4 biothreats as Fauci and congress were warned in 2008, 2015, 2018, and 2019 that the Wuhan Lab who we were funding openly at the time WERE WARNED REPEATEDLY by our ambassadors the lab was NOT UP TO SECURITY STANDARDS for a level 4 biological threat. (Dateline - 19 DECEMBER 2017 The US government has lifted its controversial ban on funding experiments that make certain pathogens more deadly or transmissible. On 19 December, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that scientists can once again use federal money to conduct ‘gain-of-function’ research on pathogens such as influenza viruses. But the agency also said that researchers’ grant applications will undergo greater scrutiny than in the past.)</p></p>

        <p>In April 2020, Rogin published a column about diplomatic cables written by US diplomats in 2018 that reported safety and staffing concerns the diplomats had expressed after three visits in late 2017 and early 2018 to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.[29] The cables reported that the WIV scientists claimed they did not have proper staffing and training to safely operate the Institute's Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) lab. The US diplomats also warned that the Institute was performing risky research on bat coronaviruses in their labs.[30] The cables were seen by some US officials to support a hypothesis that the Wuhan Institute of Virology's research may have resulted in a lab accident that caused the outbreak of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic.[31][32]  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Rogin#Wuhan_lab_theory</p>

        <p>Makes sense &amp; also most other governments have some sort of programs that pay people of a certain age (USA it is Social Security) In USA, for decades they have been looking at the problem of it not being funded &amp; gone broke. Sooo... If all these 'Boomers" were to die... Money back in the bank! </p>
<p>Anyone else remember the 'caring' Millennials naming Covid "Boomer Doomer"?</p>

        <p>Exactly. Imagine how much money you'd save if you didn't have to pay say.... 10, 20, 30% of seniors and they die at the age of 50-60, saving you 20-30+ years of payments. Under communism, the old are a liability and a drain on society.</p>

        <p>I was talking about China, obviously. Although we are under China's thumb in many ways, look at how they affect our movies for example or our research institutions. So I guess you could say we are partially under communist rule, just not directly.</p>

        <p>I know, I was just pointing out U$A has had Social Security longer than China has been Communist. </p>
<p>IMO, too many just scream "Communist" &amp; "Fascist" without knowing what the words mean as a title for 'anything I don't like'.</p>
