    <strong>Forced Testing</strong>
    <p><p>Got an email from my university today detailing the spring covid response plans. The plans are unbelievably restrictive and radical, and they include forced testing twice weekly, constant masking when not in my room, and mandatory contact tracing. However, I am in a tough spot because the only alternatives I have to staying on campus include 1) Staying home and languishing in loneliness like the last 9 months (campus was closed in fall), 2) take a gap semester and risk losing my financial aid, or 3) drop out.</p>
<p>To what extent is being forced to undergo asymptomatic testing unethical? I would say that being forced biweekly to test for a disease I do not have is not a power that a school should have. In the probable chance I end up receiving a false positive, the university holds the right to stick me in "quarantine" dorms for two weeks against my will. God knows how much I'd feel like a prisoner there. I'm shocked that my university's ethics professors are not speaking out against this policy, and it serves as an indictment against their program if they do deem it ethical. Additionally, the universal masking policy that includes the outdoors has me furious. It is one thing to ask me to wear one in the dining hall, which I would do grudgingly. But outdoors, on the sidewalk? Out of the question absurd. What gives a school administration the authority to dictate to me that I comply?</p>
<p>Hopefully my perspective on how being given no good choices on proceeding forward this spring coupled with forced asymptomatic (aka healthy) testing renders the university experience miserable is insightful. I feel as though those in power care not how college students are faring throughout the lockdowns, and we merely serve as convenient scape goats in case of an increase in statewide cases occurs. I for one am prepping myself to resist the totalitarian restrictions forced upon me by my university, and hope that resistance will prove to be more meaningful than the last months of doing Zoom University from my bedroom like too many others are doing these days.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the state of college during lockdowns? Any other college students frustrated with the state of campus policy? Does anyone have any advice on how to resist the school admin and the inevitable wave of students who are happy to follow that admin without complaint or independent thought?</p>
<p>Here's some links to my school's spring 2021 policies. Feel free to peruse the site to get an idea on what my school is forcing upon me. I can also copy the email I received about the new policy in the comments if there's interest.</p>

        <p>I always wondered that if masks supposedly worked, then why get tested? If every student is assuming they're sick 24/7, then what difference does taking a test make? The masks suddenly become ineffective if you get a meaningless positive test result?</p>
<p>Also I don't see the links you mentioned. Not sure if you are just going to post them as a comment.</p>

        <p>That presumes that the typical cloth/surgical mask actually prevents the spread of the virus. I see no reason that they do, and as such don't consider them helpful at all.</p>

        <p>I find this especially odd because I know my friend who works in an elder home has to get twice weekly covid tests. An elder home makes some sense because the whole point has been to "save Gramma". My kid's school seems to be fighting everything and doing the bare minimum expected. They recently proposed twice weekly covid tests on random students. They are saying this means each student would get tested no more than once a month. So to me it makes no sense for college students to be treated like elder care employees. It took me several days to get over my covid test. It was the "to the brain" one. I was honestly surprised how long it kept hurting and how long my nose felt violated. It was stuffy for days. With twice weekly tests you won't get the chance to get over the feeling. I'm not in your personal or financial position, but I know I'd drop out. I'm sorry you're having to make these decisions.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately dropping out is a poor option given I want to go to grad school for law. But yeah I do find it absurd that I'm being treated like a nursing home patient even tho the average age of a covid death in my state is 81 and I'm as healthy as I'll ever be.</p>

        <p>Is it the saliva test or the nose one? You aren’t supposed to eat or drink 20 mins before the saliva one so you can try to just subvert the test by drinking or eating something quickly. </p>
<p>I definitely would not risk losing your aid unless you have someone that can help pay for it.  Since Biden won they are calling for shit to open up anyway and things might be more fun soon at leas you could go out with friends instead of being home.</p>
