        <p>In all honesty, all you really have to do is scroll through this sub. No one is saying that c-19 doesn‚Äôt exist, but that it has been waaaaayyyy overblown in the name of transferring wealth and pushing the narrative on us.</p>

        <p>I think the burden of proof lies with the party making a claim. There's a deadly global pandemic and the best path forward is to crush the economy, implement authoritarianism in the name of safety, require masks, close schools, force vaccines, lockdowns, and quarantines... I shouldn't have to prove why that's a bad or dangerous idea. You need to prove why that's necessary. And I think most people on this sub, after a year of listening to the "doomers", aren't convinced.</p>
<p>I'm not, at least. It's not that i think c19 is fake, it's that I think the reaction is purposely overblown. And if your next question is "why", well we probably have fundamentally different beliefs about the nature of power, money, greed, and the lengths with which people will go to secure those things for themselves.</p>

        <p>So now covid is a question of belief?</p>
<p>Not gonna sway your opinion, bc its sorta obvious it exists (also, coronaviruses exists for a very long time anyway)</p>
<p>but the measures are extremely exaggerated:</p>
<p>lockdowns - closed businesses, schools, events, harming social life, harming non-rich people financially and existentially, mandating masks instead of strongly recommending them, thinking about only letting people into businesses and event if they have a "health app", closing borders, forcing kids to wear masks, prohibiting elderly in care homes to see their family, only allowing minimum amounts of people at funerals and weddings, forcing mothers to wear a mask during giving birth, traumatizing people with fearmongering on media day in day out etc etc</p>
<p>also, covid camps for quarantine deniers in germany</p>
<p>do you think the measures are appropriate?</p>

        <p>that you find the measures acceptable indicates you come from a place of priviledge</p>
<p>either you are a student living with buddies in a nice appartment and thus has a social life</p>
<p>or live with your significant other in a house with garden and do some job that only requires working on a computer</p>
<p>or you are a lucky introvert who simply doesnt feel anything bad is happening</p>
<p>or you simply live in a region where authorities are not veey strict and life is pretty normal. probably near forest ir beach. </p>
<p>anyway, you i wamt you to understand that there is incredible suffering based on the measures, psychosocially and financially. people dont go protest just for fun. thats the stance. also we feel coerced by authorities to take the vaccine "if we ever want the measures to end"</p>

        <p>of course covid leads to death, 
but if it was desastously dangerous, then countries with easier measures, like sweden, belarus or even florida would be absolutely devastated. </p>
<p>again: how long do you want to live with these measures? why are you so certain the measures are so effective? what exactly makes you believe that? do you have facts i have not come across yet? </p>

        <p>Just an American here, but...</p>
<p>Well, this sub isn't really a covid denial place, it's more a covid safety measures are drastically too far. As it's fairly discernable, shutting down small businesses and restaurants has hurt our economy greatly. The shutting down of those places forces the money of most into a funneling effect going into big stores Like Walmart and Kroger. This specifically is a stepping stone of, "the great reset." Which loosely stated, it's a scheme so that everything is owned by a select few, and the majority own nothing and are happy. That's a really simplified view on the reset, but I don't want to get off-topic.</p>
<p>Masks work, yes they do, for the first use. After that, most masks people are reusing don't get washed correctly. You need a commercial-grade hospital washer to destroy the harmful germs. When not washed properly, these germs pile-up and can have serious health ramifications. </p>
<p>Now that we have established that the masks can work, we should address the mortality rate. For most healthy individuals under sixty, the rate is less than one percent. </p>
<p>To step away from the science and economy for a second, I'm not sure about you, but our "leaders(typically democrats)" that are advocating for these harsh measures are not following the mandates themselves. And those are the good ones, because we had governors that sent sick covid patients(young and old) into nursing homes. This action alone led to the death for thousands of elderly both in New York and Michigan, where we're finding evidence that the governors were using their influence to hide this information. </p>
<p>Then the thing that probably makes me the most upset is the community self-policing. The people that harass others for not wearing a mask, those who call the police on their neighbors for walking down the street without a mask. I believe it was Jack Murphy. He and his kids were outside on the front lawn exercising, and his neighbor called the police.</p>
<p>Our basic stance here is you can wear a mask if you want, but respect me not wanting to wear one. </p>
<p>I also find it ironic that most people who say "you must wear a mask" and "even if it saves one life" are the same people in favor of abortion, which directly ends another life. I'm not sure how someone can hold those two thoughts at the same time and not realize the contradiction. But that's me, this sub isn't really about that specifically.</p>

A lot of your points I obviously don‚Äôt understand too much due to not being up to date on American government but I do appreciate a lot of these points and was pretty persuasive. I do disagree to some points but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much point in arguing about which point is better because they‚Äôre mostly opinion.</p>
<p>And once again I really appreciate this reply, there‚Äôs far too much people making your arguments look stupid by portraying them in a really bad way (e.g Karens not giving any evidence or incorrect evidence then screaming about it.)</p>

        <p>"Believing in" this coronavirus is a strange notion to me. It's a fact. I know there are some people who deny its existence (I'm not one of them) but when you say you "believe in COVID19" you are creating a straw man to defeat. No one is going to be able to give you "evidence" that it doesn't exist because that's not anyone's opinion.</p>
<p>I personally think the abrogations of individual freedoms were and continue to be excessive, and that it has been a terrible mistake to let fear consume us the way we have. But my real preoccupation is about what we do going forward- even with mass vaccination programs, there is a big risk that we surrender important parts of our way of life to fear.</p>

        <p>brit here. i can give you plenty uk specific info from legit sources.</p>
<p>btw: hardly anyone here thinks the virus isn't real. that idea is part of the smear campaign against those of us who don't conform.</p>
<p>i'd say this sub is mainly for those who see through the hype, don't trust the government, and don't just do things because everyone else does.</p>
<p>the main issue is that "normal" people just accept everything unquestionably.</p>
<p>this is a huge part of the backlash and making fun of "doomers" here - a year of freedoms gone and life turned completely upside down, and people don't think it is a good idea to check what we're told? they label anyone asking questions as evil/stupid, despite not asking any questions themselves, and ignoring the fact that the governments and media actively suppress any dissenting opinions.</p>
<p>look at the pointless security theatre. adopting and enforcing completely pointless behaviours like wearing a mask when you get up from your table but not while sitting, one way systems, sanitising hands with products that don't kill viruses, social distancing in enclosed spaces, stupid bits of plastic everywhere, meeting 4 people ok but not 5, etc etc etc. people getting mad because others don't do the pointless rituals they themselves do. it's like cult behaviour.</p>
<p>if you accept without evidence that without the restrictions, many more would have died, and will not hear anything to the contrary, it is not surprising you "believe" you are in so much danger.</p>
<p>you could compare this to things like the story of WMD in Iraq. it would also put you in a good mental state to accept that perhaps the government might not always tell the truth...</p>
<p>a few points i could make off the top of my head to make you think:</p>
<p>the UK government set out from day one to use  a fear campaign, as per <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/887467/25-options-for-increasing-adherence-to-social-distancing-measures-22032020.pdf">this official document</a>. to quote:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>The perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased</strong> among those who are complacent, <strong>using hard-hitting emotional messaging</strong></p>
<p>this also comes across in the stated goal of mask mandates in UK, i can't find the link now but they basically admitted it was for the psychological effect and not because they are effective at halting viral spread.</p>
<p>the campaign included stories about hospitals being 'overwhelmed' - when actually they never were, and were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/55536762">actually lower than previous years.</a></p>
<p>there <strong>were</strong> increased numbers of "excess deaths" in 2020, but this fluctuates over time, sequential weak seasons of viruses leave a significant population of vulnerable elderly people that are later swept away by new respiratory viruses. it's just normal people are not told the total number of deaths from a specific cause on the tv every day.</p>
<p>comparatively, every year before 2004 saw more deaths in relation to the population than 2020.</p>
<p><em>What we should not overlook though, is that there's a significant percentage of these excess deaths</em> <strong><em>that are</em></strong> <strong><em>caused by the lockdowns themselves,</em></strong> <em>and not the virus - especially in UK where most normal hospital activity is severely reduced, and at some points have even been completely halted - missed cancer diagnoses, delayed operations, and additional effect of the fear/stress, suicide from loss of livelihood, isolation, etc.</em></p>
<p>the "cases" are inflated, since the PCR tests are unreliable, which <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05">the WHO even admits</a>. this also affects the death reporting which inflates covid death numbers overall.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/926410/Understanding_Cycle_Threshold__Ct__in_SARS-CoV-2_RT-PCR_.pdf">a uk gov article here on PCR cycles here</a>, for some background. and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zEoRmJgt00">here is a video of the inventor</a> saying you should not use it as a diagnostic tool. long story short - if the test isn't correctly calibrated, then it will give a positive result for almost anything. there was a document which i cannot find now, that stated many UK testing labs were using 35 cycles, which is too high. it also cannot tell the difference between different corona viruses (including common cold).</p>
<p><em>never before have we decided to enact a mass testing campaign using an unreliable test, on people who have no symptoms, call them "cases", and then use this data to drive restrictions on more people who are not sick or infectious.</em></p>
<p>you will see the effect of this soon, when they reopen schools. they have decided to test every child 3 times a week, despite the fact that hardly any children get sick from the virus at all. watch what happens, predictably, to the number of "cases" and how they use it to continue restrictions.</p>
<p>that leads us to the myth of asymptomatic spread, which has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">largely debunked</a>. being that this is and other above points what is driving the entire "pandemic" response - why are we still pretending everyone is spreading a virus when they haven't even got it? did nobody think before this virus that we carried dead viruses in our bodies all the time? imagine if they tested like this for common cold or flu, or anything else.</p>
<p>lockdowns/restrictions have never been used in this way before. it's a new approach, which makes people think that it is an unprecedented danger. it is not. <strong>it is a new reaction</strong>. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/213717/dh_131040.pdf">here</a> is the UK's previous pandemic plan. to quote:</p>
<p>&rt;During a pandemic, the Government will encourage those <em>who are well</em> to carry on with their normal daily lives for as long and as far as that is possible, whilst taking basic precautions to protect themselves from infection and lessen the risk of spreading influenza to others (see Chapter 4). The UK Government does not plan to close borders, stop mass gatherings or impose controls on public transport during <strong>any</strong> pandemic.</p>
<p>this approach was discarded mainly due to China's influence on the WHO, and their funder's influence on various government bodies. this is something for later though once your toes are wet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/lockdowns-do-not-control-the-coronavirus-the-evidence/">lockdowns don't even provably work.</a> there are so many studies and comparisons you can do that show that the strictness of restrictions has very little effect on what is obviously a seasonal virus - the curves are very similar across the board, worldwide, regardless of what people do. also in most cases, the restrictions were brought in when the "cases" <a href="https://imgur.com/a/PecquxU">had already declined</a>, but people attributed it to the lockdowns. wearing masks, basically the same story.</p>
<p>countries with very soft measures have done <a href="https://twitter.com/DrEliDavid/status/1362181460887826435?s=20">just as "badly"</a>, or actually, better, tham those with stricter ones,  this being just one example. you can even look at the differences in the USA between non-mask states and those with strict mandates. countries who supposedly beat the virus last summer, had a second wave identical to everywhere else. because it is seasonal.</p>
<p>most of the differences we see between countries is more likely to be from general population health, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/3/half-of-new-delhi-residents-exposed-to-covid-says-govt-survey">existing immunity</a>/stronger immune systems, genetic predisposition, and geographical factors like temperature and humidity.</p>
<p>in addition to the above points, we know especially now, that the virus <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/discover/2020/06/coronavirus-risk-for-older-people-updated/">overwhelmingly kills the elderly</a> and those in very poor health.</p>
<p><em>it seems quite logical and obvious that these people be protected while everyone else continues life as normal -</em> <strong><em>as was the previous plan.</em></strong></p>
<p>before "THE pandemic" these people would very sadly die, from any number of causes, and their <em>cause</em> of death would be wholly inconsequential. Now, however, practically all of the elderly who die in hospital will be called a covid death, since they will be surrounded by the virus and tested multiple times, eventually coming up positive. i would argue that a lot of the problems are being produced through the testing, the measures and the panic itself, in a kind of feedback loop.</p>
<p>then you get to another elephant in the room - nobody says anything about being healthy. the other contributing factors to death from covid, apart from being old, are <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/why-covid-19-more-deadly-people-obesity-even-if-theyre-young">obesity</a>, and Vitamin <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201912">D defficiency</a>. why no talk of improving health through exercise, diet and supplements? instead we practically locked everyone inside.</p>
<p>it's as if people have decided we have no immune systems at all, and the only protections can come from the government, (and vaccines).</p>
<p><em>and so you get where we are today, where the people who are inclined to think and ask questions, are demonised as "covid-deniers", simply because they feel they should be allowed to make their own decisions and take their own risks.</em></p>
<p><em>most of the counterpoints to this stance don't hold water in the face of all the points above, i feel.</em></p>
<p>i've rambled a bit here, but this is only covering the reasons why people frequenting a sub like this may not "believe" in covid like you do.</p>
<p>if you want to go to the next step of looking into how we got here, who is responsible for the change in approach, who is profiting, who is behind the censorship, where this is taking us, etc etc, let me know ;)</p>

        <p>Take a pen and a notebook, then begin to write the numbers from 1 to 100,000 (may take a while)</p>
<p>Then go to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a> scroll down, the UK is 5th on the list.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the last column 'deaths per 100 k of the population'</p>
<p>Return to your notebook and cross off the number of deaths from your 100,000 people.</p>
<p>As of today the number of people currently dying of covid per 100,000 people in the UK is 188</p>
<p>Having written down 1 to 100,000 then crossed off 188 do you still believe it's a pandemic?</p>
<p>For reference;</p>
<p>deaths per 100 k in the USA = 161</p>
<p>deaths per 100 k in Brazil = 129</p>
<p>deaths per 100 k in Germany = 87</p>
<p>deaths per 100 k in Israel = 66</p>
