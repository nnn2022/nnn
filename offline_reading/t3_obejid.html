        <p>SS: Look at the charts.  You will see the summer of 2020 in the UK saw very low numbers of hospitalisations and deaths due to Covid.  </p>
<p>Now in the summer of 2021 we are seeing a similar reduction in the numbers of hospitalisations and deaths due to Covid.</p>
<p>And yet, the media are saying "it's coz of the vaccines!". </p>
<p>So what magic did we weave in 2020 to reduce hospitalisations and deaths due to Covid when there were no vaccines to be taken?</p>
<p>The only counterargument is that there are high number of cases right now as compared to last summer...but there were <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases">low case numbers in spring of 2020 too</a> (because..duh, lack of testing) even though there was a spike in serious cases/deaths then.  In other words, we don't know how prevalent the virus was in spring and summber of 2020 due to lack of testing.  This isn't even taking into account how inaccurate tests are anyway.  If you want more positives, add a cycle or two.</p>
