    <strong>They don't care about the truth</strong>
    <p><p>After all these discussions, these so-called debates, some more heated than others, I feel like we've already exhausted words. All the cards are on the table, and the stance of every individual, pro or against new normal, is probably not going to change by this point. But if that's the case, if all the information is out there, then why are opinions on the matter so diverging? I think I've figured it out.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They just don't care about the truth. They simply want to be part of the group. You could show them all the evidence in the world that disproves their claims, they don't care because it's not THEIR claims, it's their group's claims. In their eyes, you could either be right, or you could be wrong. They don't care either way. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We're using words as descriptions of reality: "Lockdowns don't work", "masks don't work", "COVID has a laughably low mortality rate". In contrast, they're using words as tools: "If I say 'wear a mask' people will agree with me", "if I say 'stay home, save grandma' then I won't be bullied", "if I say COVID is a serious, horrible disease that kills many, many people, then the group will accept me. I'll be one of the cool kids".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This explains why when presented with facts, they just either insult you or repeat what they just said. Those words are not for you, they're for the mainstream viewers, so that they see it and go "Aha, this is one of my guys. Very well said, good boy."</p></p>

        <p>"400,000 people have died this year from covid."  As my mother says. She can't listen to how many of those deaths were changed. The idea that gov. Hospitals etc. Could lie for $ is unfathemable to her.</p>

        <p>I ask people for any other statistic about deaths, like how many people die on average each year, perhaps from different causes.  Sure, they can say 'heart disease' isn't contagious etc. but it's interesting to me that people only know numbers associated with Covid.</p>

        <p>True! I have family who think if it's on TV it's true. Our Governor could go on tv and say the best way to fight covid is to go outside at midnight during a full moon wearing nothing but a mask, then stand on one leg jumping up &amp; down while screaming at the top of your lungs and my mother would do it, then brag about how she did exactly what she was told.</p>

        <p>The important thing to never forget about media, state-owned or otherwise, is that they are not trying to inform the public, they're trying to engage the public. Very big distinction to make.</p>
<p>Being honest, I'm probably on the "let's all wear masks" side, but I'm open to discussion. Nothing's more important than the truth after all and I'm a pretty open-minded guy...I think?</p>

        <p>Y’all don’t understand stats. 98.3% recovery rate means that 1 in every 58 people die. In third world countries it’s 1 in 25. Granted, they’re mostly elderly people or have other conditions but not “laughably low”.</p>

        <p>The irony.</p>
<p>You’re exactly what this post is referring to.</p>
<p>YOU don’t understand stats. If you did, you would know that the mortality rate is far FAR lower than that, you have to adjust for the massive false positives that even lead to a 99.97 percent survival rate in the first place or whatever the number is this week.</p>
<p>When you adjust for the PCR test being intentionally used to fraudulently label masses of people covid positive, then you inflate the death rate to 1 in 56 or whatever in the first place!</p>
<p>Countries that are genuinely labeling pre existing conditions like heart disease or cancer as heart disease or cancer deaths are seeing (surprise) an insanely low death rate — what is to be expected from a flu like illness.</p>
<p>I believe it’s Finland for example that currently has a whole 2 people dying a day or something.</p>

        <p>And you don’t understand math. If there are less cases then the mortality rate is <em>higher</em> because it is deaths/cases.</p>
