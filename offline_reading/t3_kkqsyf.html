    <strong>I can’t relate to most people anymore.</strong>
    <p><p>Most everyone in my life is -still- scared of this nonsense.</p>
<p>They are proudly and stupidly forever masked, still thinking that they help.
They shrug off anything that I say is wrong, or suspicious. (tests inaccurate, it’s a flu, 99% survival rate...)
They are so “sure this won’t be permanent”,  yet simultaneously refuse to allow themselves to let go of the fear.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to talk to people anymore.
I just see them as these selfish zombies, doing what they’re told: staying home and expecting everyone else to do the same forever...ah but sure according to them this “won’t be forever”.</p>
<p>Safe to say that if someone hasn’t changed their mind on it yet, they never will.</p>
<p>Sometimes I just want to be rid of everyone in my life accepting this farce.
But if I did that I would be more alone than ever.
But then if I stay knowing them...Likely I will remain perpetually frustrated.</p></p>

        <p>It definitely sucks. I often feel like I've fallen into Idiocracy. Maybe it's always been this bad with people, maybe 98% of humanity is already pretty weak-minded and easily manipulatable and the scamdemic just further exposed it. I see the growth on this subreddit as a glimmer of hope.</p>

        <p>The silver lining to this whole fucking catastrophe is that I've winnowed down the people on this Earth with whom I wish to associate. It's been kind of a relief in that aspect.

        <p>Most people have basically always been this way. If they are kept out of making important decisions then things can work. But the problem with democracy is that political decisions become based on who can court the most votes of the dumbest people.</p>

        <p>The worst is that they feel something is wrong with you. It's not enough to have a difference of opinion, but that yours is morally beneath theirs. Yours represents danger, a threat, carelessness and the works. </p>
<p>I have said it once (More like 300 times) and I'll say it again. Political or spiritual beliefs aside - how horrible must your life of been for this solitary confinement to be acceptable.  </p>

How are they no longer bored - what activities do they do to keep themselves entertained? What dreams, goals or plans do they have for their lives?

        <p>For most people, the lockdown has been just as bad as it has for you, but they're sucking it up because they think it's worth it. You're free to disagree, but it's not like the people who you disagree with love this stuff. They're just toughing it out because they think it serves a greater cause. </p>
<p>I had to cancel Christmas with my family this year because they had been quarantining, and I hadn't been able to, so I posed a risk to them. It sucked for me, and I was very unhappy, but I couldn't justify putting them at risk just because of some emotional desire. No one was happy about it, we just made a risk analysis and toughed it out. We ended up having a very nice Christmas anway.</p>

        <p>This just isn’t true. Read the posts on here about people who still want to wear masks when this is all said and done. People who are wishing the lockdown never ends. There’s no nobility in “sticking it out“ when it doesn’t even do anything.</p>
<p>Suffering in virtually every aspect of your life should not Garner praise or some type of accomplished feeling. Enabling this cult like “its good to never leave your house” is a sign of complete and utter capitulation and societal failure. We are social creatures. If you’re OK with not seeing your friends for another year in the name of sticking it out, there’s something wrong with you and not me.</p>
<p>If this goes on much longer, the people that are sticking it out are just going to be viewed as morons. What is righteous about idly sitting by at the destruction of the world? Ironically, caused by everything but the virus.</p>

<p>This is where I disagree. People are different. You may not be happy with this, and that's fine, and I'm sorry you feel that way. But there isn't anything wrong with anyone who feels that this level of suffering is tolerable enough. My point is that I don't like the restrictions, but I've been able to stay happy throughout it, even though it sucks. I don't see why there would be something wrong with me because I'm able to stay happy through a situation I don't like, and you're the normal one because you aren't able to stay happy.</p>
<p>The reality is that everything in life has some degree of suffering and pain to it. Pro-maskers believe that this level is tolerable and isn't negatively impacting their quality of life.</p>
<p>I'm one of the people that thinks we should continue to wear masks after this is passed. Why? Because wearing a mask is a very, very minor inconvenience to me, and if I give someone the flu, it could be a very, very big disturbance to their life.</p>
<p>We all just have different pain tolerances, essentially. If people were saying I have to wake up at 8 in the morning and sit in traffic to get to my job, I'd probably be on your side. You might find that tolerable, but I don't. On the other hand, you don't find wearing a mask tolerable, I do.</p>

        <p>But here's the thing. When reddit tells me they're toughing it out, I have a hard time believing that.</p>
<p>A website that censors virtually everything. 
They can't stick it out for others opinions.
They can't stick it out for others religious view points
They can't stick it out for others views and scientific data on the virus.</p>
<p>I mean, it seems like the only time they can is when it consists of sitting at home and collecting unemployment or bragging about what pair of pajama pants they'll be wearing on the next zoom meeting.</p>
<p>You pro-maskers and people that are for the lockdown are quite happy, as you've stated - entertaining these draconian restrictions. So I guess all is well.</p>
<p>The issue is that you won't allow people who think like me to live life again. It's like - Everything is fine as long as it suits my lifestyle. Everything is fine as long as I agree with it.</p>
<p>You talk about wearing the mask a minor inconvenience but what about being in support of the lockdowns that have caused record high suicides, overdoes, job loss / unemployment,  ect. You'll blame me for making this thing go on longer (More people dying) but would probably find it ridiculous if I said you're responsible for those tragic statistics of things outside of covid. To those who are now packing up because their house just sold at auction, those who are having their family come over to clean up the brain matter on the wall, and to those that are passed out in their room with a syringe in their arm - THEY are the ones having trouble but you don't care about them. It always goes back to the same thing "Well if we just would've warn masks this would've been over and that wouldn't happened". You cannot win.</p>
<p>You cannot convince me otherwise. Sacrifice has become servitude. This is not healthy. Healthy individuals will not continue to play by these inhumane rules and regulations. If someone wants to keep them going, they probably weren't healthy in the first place.</p>

        <p>As someone who was severely suicidal for 5 years, to the point where I was seriously considering going to Europe to get assisted suicide, the response I have is just that suicide is ultimately a result of internal circumstances, not external ones. Changes of external circumstances can help no doubt, but it's ultimately people's attitudes that affect whether they are suicidal or not. Stable, healthy people are likely not the ones who are becoming suicidal from this. There are lots of people who endure <em>far</em> worse than this (loss of their entire family plus unemployment, severe disability, loneliness, chronic pain, all at once), and are still able to stay pretty happy. Meanwhile, I became suicidal for reasons that most people would think are completely laughable.</p>
<p>&rt;You pro-maskers and people that are for the lockdown are quite happy, as you've stated - entertaining these draconian restrictions. So I guess all is well.</p>
<p>I'm not happy entertaining these restrictions, I'm happy despite them. I'm not letting an external reality that I strongly dislike interfere with my own internal sense of wellbeing.</p>
<p>&rt;would probably find it ridiculous if I said you're responsible for those tragic statistics of things outside of covid.</p>
<p>No, I understand that statistically these lockdowns cause harm alongside the good. Nothing is black and white. I accept that there are sadly going to be some casualties in what is essentially a war against a virus. My viewpoint is that there will be more casualties if this doesn't get contained and controlled to some extent because not only will people continue to die, but the economy isn't going to recover until it's under control. In my region, there are very few strict restrictions right now, but people are <em>willingly</em> wearing masks, isolating, etc. because they think it's what they should be doing. If people are intrinsically motivated to not partake in the economy, those things you mentioned are not going to magically go away because they government says go back and work and go about your life as normal.</p>
<p>&rt;You cannot convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you've admitted you're exactly what you say you're not: you're dogmatic, not open to reasonable and rational discussion, and you won't change your viewpoint no matter what anyone says.</p>

<p>My viewpoint remains unchanged - For a virus with a 99% survival rate, life must go on. We must socialize, businesses must reopen, we cannot cultivate PTSD in people to only view others as virus carriers, wear masks that do little to nothing, and continue these lockdowns.</p>
<p>That's probably the issue. Is most of us here are too rational and that shutting down an entire country for 9 months (Soon to easily exceed a year) is irrational and more harmful than good. Referring to the things I've named as nothing more than "casualties" says it all.</p>
<p>This has gone on too long. The virus rate is still climbing. People are wearing masks more than ever, it's still going up. It's not working. We must live life more than simply existing.</p>

        <p>&rt;Is most of us here are too rational</p>
<p>This subreddit is not the bastion of rationality that you think it is. I don't think I'll be able to convince you otherwise, but if you look and see the amount of anger, frustration, name calling (sheeple, morons, doomers, etc.), you'll eventually come to that realization. Rational people are able to see something they don't like without resorting to emotional responses and name calling, which are inherently irrational.</p>
<p>&rt;shutting down an entire country for 9 months</p>
<p>The country has not been shut down for 9 months. Almost everyone I know is going about their lives just as normal. Many go to restaurants, they get haircuts, they take vacations, they fly on airplanes, they see their friends. I see videos of friends going to clubs and partying, which I disagree with, but it's happening all over. </p>
<p>Florida has almost zero restrictions in place, and the Dakotas only recently started implementing minor ones. If you're the rationalist you claim to be, you will concede that you can't say the entire country has shut down for 9 months when several parts of the country have <em>not</em> shutdown. By definition, that is not the "entire country."</p>
<p>&rt;I am completely open to reasonable and rational discussion.</p>
<p>If you are open to rational discussion in good faith, then you must accept the possibility that at some point your opinion may change if new information or arguments are presented. If you are going to begin a conversation saying "You cannot convince me otherwise" then you are stating that you won't be open to a rational conversation because even a rational argument won't convince you — that's dogmatic thinking. I am open to being convinced by you if you present something new and convincing to me. My view has shifted slightly since being on here, but it has not swung to the full extreme that this sub espouses.</p>
<p>&rt;For a virus with a 99% survival rate, life must go on.</p>
<p>The thing you are missing here is that it's not just about the survival rate. Just a few months ago, I lost part of my vision and developed headaches. I'm in my 20s. I think it's very unlikely that it's related to COVID because I've been so careful, but I looked it up, and there are several case studies that report the same type of vision loss that  I experienced, and the cause was determined to be COVID. There are lots of reports of people who lost their sense of taste, experience severe brain fog, and memory issues to the point where it's disabling, etc. If you think that lockdown is going to give people PTSD, I think it's reasonable to assume that becoming permanently disabled would have a similar effect. Again, I'm not saying that what happened to me was due to COVID, but it's a very disturbing thing to seemingly have sudden and permanent vision loss (the doctors can't figure out what caused mine), and if COVID has been shown to precipitate that, those people will likely be quite distraught following these types of symptoms.</p>
<p>&rt;Referring to the things I've named as nothing more than "casualties" says it all.</p>
<p>This seems to be a projection of some sort. I'm not using the word casualties to downplay anything. Casualties are very serious. But in some cases they are unavoidable. There is no perfect solution.</p>

<p>You can have emotions and still be rational. Just because someone says something angrily or with frustration doesn't mean they don't have a good basis for it.</p>

        <p>Having emotions is not the issue, it's acting on them in an unproductive way. When someone brings up a study, argument, etc., and the response is "you're a sheep," it doesn't speak very well to someone's ability to engage in a rational discourse.</p>

        <p>I got sick of the morons, even in my own family and circle of friends. So what I do now is totally mock them. I go out wearing full PPE, rubber gloves and a mask with goggles. When they say anything about it, I just say, “you been in a mask almost a year now” </p>
<p>I met my friend a few days ago at the mall wearing it, danced around singing, “Rona is in the air so gotta wear my facial underwear 🎶 “ He was so embarrassed </p>

        <p>I agree with you, pretty much everyone is only interested in distraction and entertainment. But what I'm confused about is that the pro-lockdown people are the ones shutting down entertainment, and anti-lockdown people are saying we need to open it back up because life isn't worth living without it. Can you clarify why you're saying the people who are pro-entertainment (anti-lockdown) are less attached to entertainment than the anti-entertainment (pro-lockdown) people are?</p>

        <p>Couple of theories as to what's going on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Testosterone levels are far too low in society and have been for a long time. Men 100 years ago were walking around with an average T-level 2-3 times higher than we are now. Lack of testosterone makes people far more obedient and sheepish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're far more poorly educated than we once were (and think the opposite). Poor education leads to poor general knowledge (and interestingly a somewhat high degree of specialist knowledge in the population) leading to a complete lack of faith in one's abilities to judge things outside of their own area of expertise. It used to be that the top ~25% of the population had this faith instilled in them through a well-rounded general education; nowadays it's a rarer quality, perhaps derived from degrees of self-education (or confidence in one's opinion however derived).</p>

        <p>I’m guessing you’re some internet nerd who plays video games all day and finds purpose in spreading dangerous conspiracies. You didn’t do good in school because it’s too mainstream. You didn’t find meaningful work because everyone else is just too dumb to understand how smart you are. You don’t have meaningful relationships because you’re just too open minded.</p>
<p>Lol testosterone. Talking about testosterone as if it’s some social glue and there is a massive decline just to cover up your own insecurities about being a sexual failure and weak yourself</p>

        <p>Yes, it is so disconcerting and frustrating. I don't know a single person who isn't buying in. I moved to the sticks so I can cut myself off from most of it and spend a lot of time outside gardening. Spring can't get here fast enough.</p>

        <p>I feel like I’m the asshole now in most situations because I’m constantly gaslit into questioning my own sanity. I <em>want</em> to have a constructive conversation with someone on the other side and maybe if it’s logical and makes sense, I’d be willing to change some ideas I have...but it always devolves straight into them having fallacious and purely emotional arguments.</p>

        <p>This year has been a skaters paradise and hell at the same time. On one hand our deployment got extended by two months and post deployment leave got cancelled, which sucked sick. My unit was actually on ship when all this shit started so all we had was rumors. We literally thought the world was ending lol. </p>
<p>On the other hand I can’t tell you how much stupid shit nobody wants to do has gotten cancelled. At least three field ops got canked this year, and we just do text accountability most days and PT on your own (so go lift at the gym or go back to sleep). </p>
<p>We have all the same stupid rules about masks and social distancing and quarantines too. </p>
<p>So it’s 50/50</p>

        <p>My wife grew up in the USSR and compares how she feels now to how her parents felt in the Soviet Union. I'm not drawing a 1:1 comparison and saying you will be hauled off to the gulag but its the same in terms of the paranoia it instills in people. You had to be so careful if you held pro-west or pro-capitalism opinions about who you shared those with because you could be reported, lose your job, be socially shamed and cut out of friends groups. </p>
<p>And we're seeing that today. If you question anything about the media narrative you're some MAGA hatted covidiot mass murderer. </p>
<p>It's made me incredibly distrustful of even my own family.</p>

        <p>I've been at odds with people during this whole thing. But at first, I was the one who thought the rest of the world wasn't taking it seriously. Since my awakening to the real world, I haven't trusted government. So when I was seeing videos from China, but the US wasn't saying anything and Nancy Pelosi was saying to party in Chinatown, I was on the other end. I was wearing an N95 in public and getting yelled at cause "Fauci says they don't do anything". I was even shamed at 2 doctors offices for wearing masks (by doctors and nurses). I began to have a problem when masks were mandated. Because if my distrust of government, I knew that to be a slippery slope. My whole thing is that government lies. Things that are a real threat, they will usually cover up. Things that are hyped up should be heavily scrutinized. The government does not care about you. Period!!!!! And I definitely am not going to take the word of people such as Gates, who notoriously believes that getting rid of most of the world's population is the key to saving the earth.</p>

        <p>Don't, not about covid anyway. Were they your friends before this? They are the same people just scared. You have to let them go through that process and sad to say it's not an easy thing to accept. It will literally break people's minds when the truth comes out and things will double in crazy. We are awake now, I say personally prepare for that eventuality. The programming on this is complete and ain't nothing but some monumental shock to their systems is going to wake them.</p>
