    <strong>A rant from a 19 year old guy</strong>
    <p><p>am a 19 year old man. I had a future  planned out, for my life. Things were going well, in 2019 i graduate HS  and had a normal graduation, etc. I had the idea that is what life  would be, there was such a great feeling of hope in the air and  optimism. But then COVID hit, and we can't even have THAT anymore. The  uncertainty of it all is getting to me, call me "weak" but i cannot even watch a pre Covid movie, all it does is remind me of a better world that  i (nor anyone else) is living in right now, nope, we live in the shiny  "NEW NORMAL ™ !</p>
<p>I watched that new  Adam Sandler movie that came out this year, it was made pre Covid but  came out recently, i was watching it, and it clearly depicts a pre Covid  world, with gatherings, parties, fun, etc. And watching it, yes,  watching an Adam Sandler movie, i broke down crying and had to leave the  room because i couldn't mentally get over the fact that the normal  world i was seeing in the film that i had grown to love for the last 18  1/2 FUCKING years of my life, was gone and that stepping outside would  only show me a bleak dystopia. It feels like a crazy nightmare that i  can't wake up from, this WASN'T MEANT TO HAPPEN! This is NOT how things  were supposed to be damn it!</p>
<p>Every  day i see the headlines and can only imagine how crazy they would have  sounded to me back in summer of 2019, how i would have written it off as  some crazy Orwellian sounding conspiracy theory that would never happen  in real life, but, here we are! Each day i get closer and closer to  just offing myself. I, and my generation, did not sign up for this, we  did not sign up to live in a communist dystopia to look forward to  despite the fact that our ancestors fought and died to PREVENT this kind  of shit from happening.</p></p>

        <p>I hear you man. 31/M here. 2019 was a great year for me, life was really on an upward trajectory. All to come crashing down. I developed a debilitating chronic condition due to sitting all day every day due to the lockdowns. I now have to spend thousands of dollars to see a private practitioner because the doctors don't want to do anything other than poison me with medication, because it's the fastest "solution". And what's sad is that 1x1 time with my physical therapist will me the most intimate social interaction I've had all year.</p>
<p>Check out David Icke on Bitchute. His answer is simple. If enough people just STOP COOPERATING, the hoaxdemic ends tomorrow. There are too many of us for them to enforce it.</p>

        <p>Hey man, I don't know your condition at all but I just wanted to share an inspiring video with you on the off chance it helps or at least makes you feel any hope at all. It really inspired me. I wish you health and a speedy recovery (although I know that may not be possible). Good luck! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX9FSZJu448</p>

        <p>You guys are soooo black and white. How has your mental state not pushed you to exhaustion yet?? This guy has an inflamed nutsack that more than likely came from an STI or a nasty viral infection and he’s pushing a false narrative that it’s from the lock down and not moving. </p>
<p>I work directly in the public and your group of thinking it’s combative and already making my job so much harder than it needs to be. I don’t want you to get sick, but I think you’re all petulant and malicious in the way you go about things.</p>
<p>There’s literally a post comparing MASKS to a SLAVE COLLAR. If that doesn’t scream privilege and ignorance I don’t know what does. You all are afraid of any sort of change and it shows. Covid 19 is a temporary evil, and sometimes temporary can be somewhat lengthy. And that’s OK. </p>
<p>You’re all just so god damned weird.</p>

        <p>Lmao. I love the "you wanna kill grandma" nonsense. If it's a "mostly peaceful riot" by the thousands or a pro Biden celebration by the tens of thousands, "studies" will show it "did not contribute to a spike." If you have 11 people over for Thanksgiving, you are a selfish "super spreader." Actually, what's selfish is to demand my freedom ends where your fear begins.</p>
<p>The crux of the scam lies within the false positives of the PCR test and the "asymptomatic" angle. Telling people they're sick when there's nothing wrong with them. That's how they justify this. Any sane person knows if you're actually sick to stay away from other poeple.</p>

        <p>I’m 16 and I know exactly what you’re talking about. I had a future planned out too. I had a similar experience yesterday when I saw the kids on TV sitting with masked Santa and a piece of glass separating them. They looked so unhappy. These kids haven’t done shit to anyone, why are people conditioning them to this dystopian world? I realized that I’ve never seen so many hopeless, emotionless, dead eyes until this year. </p>
<p>I just broke down crying. I used to get angry, I used to cuss and argue at the idiots, but what’s the use when nothing is changing? Feels like we’re in a stasis. I have no reasons to look forward to tomorrow, and people expect me to be happy for the holidays? What a fucking joke. I’m starting to think that this whole planet, and the people that are still scared of this virus are nothing but a fucking joke. There is no reason to live anymore, and people are still afraid of death? They’re more worried about keeping themselves alive than actually <em>living</em>? I just can’t wrap my brain around any of these current events. Why is this even happening? What did any of us do to deserve an entire year of solitary confinement and isolation? When will this punishment end?</p>

        <p>I've been watching a lot of older (pre march 2020) videos and live concerts on youtube like I often do since there isn't as good content anymore that hasn't been contaminated with a constant reminder of the new normal. Sometimes I do and go out forgetting immediately that it's a thing and then when I get around more populated areas I enter the twilight zone and the nightmare continues. There was so much I had planned too and other things I was getting over that it slowed down to a crawl. No more family get togethers, no more holidays, no more social events, no more live music, no more restaurants, no more normal shops, no more normal people. Unless I go way out into nature the world no longer even looks free, there is no escape from it with no end in sight. This is not life, it's more like being trapped in a mirror world that looks just like the normal one but you don't know how you got there and everything is inverted on itself. In 2019 everyone would have called this insane but now everyone is doing the opposite of that and the opposite of how they lived their lives for the most part. The general feeling in public now is very dark, bleak, and tense.</p>

        <p>Please don't kill yourself. I know the future seems bleak, but there are more and more people starting to stand up to these ridiculous restrictions.  We've got to fight the fight and I trust that we will prevail.  Things will be good again one day, and you will keep progressing through life and look back at this as if it was a nightmare. Just focus on what you can control.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel dude, I'm 16 and am going through similar feelings. All my friends believe this stuff wholeheartedly and it's depressing. No one questions the narratives. I'm done being a useful idiot. Hang on man, it'll get better eventually.</p>

        <p>I'll echo this also. I've wasted many years of my life either afraid to try or paying for past mistakes. 2020 was the year I decided I was done being afraid and was going to step out and take some risks. And well..you know. It wasn't supposed to be this way is exactly right. All we can do is continue to fight these restrictions. Otherwise as Nathan Hale once said</p>

        <p>Do this: go create an account on meetup.com and look for live events in your area. You can use this to find like-minded people who share the same perspective about what’s going on and start to create new social circles.</p>
