    <strong>The real problem we're facing</strong>
    <p><p>You know what? the real issue we're facing on a global level isn't the evil psychopaths, the so called 'elite' who are pulling the strings. Why? Because there will ALWAYS be evil and good in this world, we can't change that. We can't ask for a perfect world. It's been that way since the beginning of time and it will remain that way forever. But the real issue is the 90% of people who are not willing to look deeper into things even if it's for their own good, who are not willing to research something individually despite strong evidence or even proof being presented to them. Instead, they let the "elites" do the thinking for them by listening to the media which is fully controlled by these "people". As long as the 90% can watch football and eat their doritos, they are satisfied. </p>
<p>If the majority of people knew what went on behind the scenes, this historic level of manipulation would be impossible to achieve. What if the police, fbi, army, and your regular Joe knew what was going on and were on our side? What if the media were on our side? Under these conditions I'm pretty sure we as humanity would've come together as one and would've done something about it, we would've gotten ourselves out of this mess one way or another. But how can people solve a problem, when they have no idea that there is a problem in the first place? How can they get themselves out of a hole, when they're not aware that they are in one? </p>
<p>As long as the 'elites' are able to hypnotize the 90% and get them to obey their commands, nothing will change in this world no matter how hard we try.</p>
<p>We, the (approximately) 10% get mocked by the 90% for pointing out the real issues in this world, the same issues that are affecting them, but they fail to see it no matter how you present that information to them or how much evidence you show them. Meanwhile the media can make any claim they want, and regardless of <a href="https://i.ibb.co/k8NRG1T/The-gullible-will-believe-anything.jpg">how ridiculous it may sound</a>, the 90% are happy to obey to their commands.</p></p>

        <p>It's true, you can't present them with data. Gotta attack their psychology directly if you want to change their minds.</p>

        <p>IMO people always act according to what they <em>perceive</em> to be in their interests. People always think that society can recognize when others are doing harm on a massive scale but history has shown that isn't the case in the short run. The reason being that the powerful ones leading the harm believe they are doing it for the benefit of all. They believe it and others following believe it. And when things don't work, in their minds it's always because of some "others" who need to be destroyed. I think with this and a lot of other topics, people know it's bullshit but they think that if they continue the charade long enough, they get a utopia. And that's where they are wrong. Unfortunately it's a process that takes time to play out where one by one people give up on the premise as their utopia gets farther and farther away.</p>
