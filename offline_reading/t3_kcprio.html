        <p>Can we tone down the generic anti-vaccine rhetoric in this sub please?</p>
<p>Being wary of hastily developed CV19 vaccines, that have no long term data on either efficacy or safety, is one thing, and is entirely on point for this sub.</p>
<p>Using this sub as a platform for general anti-vaccine sentiments is problematic though, because it detracts from the main point of this sub (resisting the covid-specific ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù), and makes us easy to pigeonhole as lunatics.</p>
<p>In this case, OPV is a tradeoff: it‚Äôs easier to transport and administer than other polio vaccines, but that comes at the expense of causing a small number of those dosed to get polio. Given how serious polio is, that‚Äôs just as valid a public policy strategy as what we advocate for on CV19 policy: If we open everything up, and remove all restrictions from the general population, while putting reasonable and prudent controls in place to isolate and protect known vulnerable populations (e.g. elderly people in nursing homes), a lot of people are going to get the virus, and some will die. The end result of that though, is that we‚Äôll get through it quickly, and we will do so with minimal damage to society as a whole.</p>

        <p>I agree. The corona vaccine is largely unnecessary and somewhat dangerous, but that doesn‚Äôt mean all vaccines are. The vast majority have been properly clinically tested and are extremely safe. </p>
<p>Some people on this sub apparently want to see outbreaks of measles, smallpox, and meningitis.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not convinced that the various vaccine candidates are necessarily dangerous‚Äîthat‚Äôs the point: we don‚Äôt have long term data to tell us the potential issues with these vaccine candidates, nor do we have sufficient data to know how effective they truly are (how long will the conferred immunity last, will it actually prevent you from spreading it to others, etc.).</p>
<p>The acceptable risk profile of a vaccine is going to vary by disease, both in terms of infectivity and impact. The level of side effects I‚Äôd accept from a vaccine for Mumps (which can cause male sterility) is very different from what I‚Äôd accept for the kind of coin flip that the flu vaccine represents.</p>

        <p>That's a well known limitation of the oral polio vaccine, which is why it's only used in countries with low vaccine coverage and/or high risk of wild cases. However, it has the advantage of being easier to distribute in areas with poor infrastructure and being more effective.</p>
<p>I don't want the coronavirus vaccine and oppose "zero COVID" policies, but I fully support polio eradication.</p>

        <p>This doesn't make sense... what is so different about the oral polio vaccine from the regular shot polio vaccine that has never sparked outbreaks on its own?</p>
<p>I think we need some investigations into this.</p>
