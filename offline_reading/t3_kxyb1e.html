    <strong>U.S. Gov Corporate Corruption</strong>
    <p><p>It's clear for many years the U.S. Gov has been using bailouts, subsidies, grants as a means of leverage against independent corporate interests, and now, increasingly, against independent people. This is intolerable and will lead down a bloody road as people's concerns are deemed unfit for public discourse and are silenced. This cannot be allowed to happen. </p>
<p>It is clear the Government is willfully bypassing the Constitution by using private corporations as proxies for its self-enriching goals. Federalism is becoming more and more of a problem as money is siphoned off our taxes and our hard work and sucked up by these fucking politicians, and their cronies, and their contractors. If you've ever been to NoVA, you know. It's McMansion after McMansion after McMansion and all of these fucking people have gotten rich off our work. And now they want to silence us.</p>
<p>We need a new law. Or better, a new amendment, declaring ANY company that has been bailed out by the government, subsized by the government, given funding or direct access to the government and its programs, is therefore UTTERLY CORRUPTED by the government, and cannot be trusted to act independent of the government. Therefore THESE COMPANIES MUST be SUBJECT to the confining nature of the U.S. CONSTITUTION until their dissolution.</p>
<p>This must be done.</p>
<p>We can't be safe from intrusive mask mandates, or vaccine mandates, or lockdown mandates until this happens. The Federal Government will use its influence with private corporations to fuck with us until we're on our knees begging for them to stop. Federal tyranny through corporate discrimination must be stopped before it's too late for all of us who think a little bit different.</p></p>
