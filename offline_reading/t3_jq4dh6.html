    <strong>Is anyone else now ok not having friends anymore?</strong>
    <p><p>I had to ditch all my friends because they're all doomers and I got tired of waiting on them and trying to set up hangouts only for them to be absolute pussies and say they only do socially distanced park hangs. </p>
<p>I live alone and at first it was really lonely not having friends and it still definitely is from time to time but in a way it's kind of freeing. If such a b*tch ass flu virus is enough to destroy a friendship it must mean that friendship wasn't really that special in the first place. I see this thing as a way to shed my old skin and transform into a new person who doesn't have to maintain a certain image that my old friends expected. It's also given me an opportunity to truly be myself without having to worry about biting my tongue all the time worried about offending people. </p>
<p>Anyone else see a bright-side to this situation?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t know if I’m okay with it,  but I’ve come to accept that this is how it will be from now until this fear dies down. However if I learn that any of my doomer friends go to a Biden street celebration I will drop them.</p>

        <p>Are you going to be friends with them after this whole thing is over?
I'm finding it kind of hard to consider that option, I fell like they've showed their true colors and I'm not interested in hanging out with "men" who are like that.</p>

        <p>I honestly don’t know. It’s kind of unchartered territory for me. I have one friend I literally haven’t talked fo in person for months, and we work together! She holes herself in her office all day, and doesn’t do anything outside of work. Won’t even go to a restaurant and eat outside. So she’s missed a lot of developments in my life, like the fact that I have a boyfriend now and it’s getting serious. After so long I don’t really have a desire to rekindle anything. I suppose I’ll have to see. Some of my other friends have been so utterly obnoxious and insufferable that I’ve just lost respect for them.</p>

        <p>I have a hard time with friends and family members who I now know, without a doubt, would cheer on as families are separated and placed in "quarantine facilities".</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t say I’m OM with not having friends anymore. However... right now, I feel like it’s easier. The majority of people I respected from January to early March have fallen in line with restrictions and “simple actions that can save lives.” I am “cruel,” “sad,” “selfish” etc. for not wanting to go along with their sheep compliance. I try to go to my hobbies and get nagged by COVID Karens who can’t keep themselves home even though they have immunocompromised family or are just plain paranoid. (And this is at a “non essential” business, not at the grocery store or Walmart. They can easily keep away, but for some reason they deem themselves special and above that concept.) My friends who were once fun and smart and I looked forward to seeing are now shells of themselves. They are COVID drones, and it’s all they care about. These people are not worth my time anymore. I live alone and not one friend checked on me or just sent a message to say hi. It was just “change your mindset; this motivational podcast is great!” and “Be positive; you would change your mind if you were exposed and had to be tested.” (I will never be tested for no reason and I will not get the vaccine either.) </p>
<p>I’d rather be alone than have to go to the gym in a mask and workout in one too. I’d rather be alone and give up church and faith than not be permitted to sing and rushed out of church like I don’t belong there or like it’s the drive thru at McDonald’s. I’d rather never support my local sports teams again than to have to go sit socially distanced in a stadium with a mask on and have my every move controlled. </p>
<p>It’s tough being a free thinker but the alternative of just going along is even worse. People need to learn to think for themselves and not just immediately fall into line with whatever is trendy. But it’s too hard for them.</p>

        <p>Why would being exposed and tested make you suddenly supportive of the restrictions and mandates? I would perhaps understand if you got severely ill, but infected does not necessarily equal ill.</p>

        <p>The sheep are suffering from severe delusional psychopathy.</p>
<p>They think that those of us who haven’t turned into covid drones just don’t “get” how world-endingly awful this virus truly is. That we just haven’t seen the right data points. That if we just look at the right graph, we’ll suddenly fall into line.</p>

        <p>If my husband or I get tested - rather, if we were <em>forced</em> or <em>coerced</em> into getting tested, which is the only way it would happen - we would only grow even more adamantly against all this bullshit. Get a giant cotton swab shoved up our nose, test positive for a common cold, go in a database of notifiable diseases, be expected to rat out our friends and family, deal with harassment from health authorities, potentially have police officers stationed outside our home to make sure we don't break quarantine? No thanks. Husband and I haven't been to a doctor's office or hospital in 10 years, and we don't plan to, not even in the most dire of circumstances. If we suspect we've been exposed to COVID, we're gonna go on with our daily lives and maybe stay home if we feel too sick.</p>

        <p>My sister is the one who said that. She was exposed to a positive case at her job and was required to get tested three times in two weeks. She thinks if I had to get swabbed I’d understand how serious and scary this is, I guess. (This had to have been her workplace policy...the other people I know who had exposures took ONE test and quarantined while they waited for their results, then stopped quarantine after they were negative. One person didn’t even stop going out at all.) </p>
<p>My sister works in a healthcare facility (mental health), though, and is an RN. I work in a business where I’ve been remote since March, and even in the office, our building isn’t somewhere the public comes into and we have nothing to do with healthcare. I’d be looking for another job if my employer mandated testing and an eventual vaccine. My job isn’t even in the same ballpark as my sister’s.</p>

        <p>It's important to have people in your life you don't agree with. My family supports the new normal and I have friends who are doomers and who I politically disagree with on everything. They know how I feel, but we can still have relationships.</p>

        <p>Honestly you have to use the situation to your advantage which it sounds like you totally are so props to that.</p>
<p>I'm in the same boat. I can't hang around people who constantly scoff at 'karens' for not wearing their masks properly and just have no critical thinking skills. I've tried to reason with them but it seems a sealed deal.</p>

        <p>Fortunately in my area things are starting to open back up next week, when they're open I'm going to start some martial arts classes to find some non-pussified men to befriend. </p>
<p>Not sure how it'll go but sports and fitness places seem to harbor more sane people than than the rest of the world so that's my recco for non-internet groups.</p>

        <p>I think you're likely to find like-minded people in activities that are impossible to do with any level of social distancing. Like anyone who is willing to wrestle or do jujitsu isn't going to be a doomer. The only people I hang out with these days are Latin dancers for that reason.</p>

        <p>I don't have many friends.</p>
<p>My one friend doesn't give a shit about it.</p>
<p>My lady friend takes all the precautions but when I educated her about the low death rates she was actually quite shocked to hear. She still wears her mask in stores, but doesn't give me any trouble over not wearing one.</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about this exact same thing and contemplated making a post about it. I’ve noticed a trend that the less someone makes, the more they support lockdowns. I work in the legal field and I’m 25. My coworkers that are close to my age are against lockdowns. My other friends work in different professions and are pro-lockdown. </p>
<p>I’ve let a few of those friends go because they couldn’t get the stick out of their ass. I’ve just concluded that they weren’t worth having around in the first place.</p>

        <p>Husband and I make $10,000 a year or less. Both of us are extremely anti-lockdown. From my experience, it seems the MORE someone makes, the more they support lockdowns. And it also seems like urbanites/suburbanites are more pro-lockdown.</p>

        <p>I definitely have noticed the more rich someone is, the more likely they are to support lockdowns. Also, work from home workers for whatever reason more often support lockdowns, too. It's the lower working classes, who seem to be the ones most often against lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Let them get wiped out if that’s what they want.  Don’t let that stop you living your life though.  Keep doing what you like and if they want to join let them.  Just don’t let them shove opinions down your throat.  I have a couple of friend that have been trying for years -global warming, vegan stuff... I don’t get angry, i just tell them I have a different opinion about some things and end it.  We still have common interests, but yes, the whole lockdown/masks/UBI is good mentally definitely brought them down a notch.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I’ve saved so much money by not getting them any birthday or Christmas presents. I’m hoping to get enough for a one way plane ticket out of crazy Australia and a new life in sane Sweden.</p>

        <p>I think you can extend this to dating too. In other words, in the future, will we select partners based on how they reacted during the COVID times? Is it a deal-breaker or can we simply accept the other person has a completely different view on life and still make it work?</p>

I am also not making any effort to meet new people. It all just seems like it would be too difficult during "these unprecedented times."</p>

        <p>What we need is a new world wide Social Media app called "Kinect" specifically created to find friends with similar personalities, political views and interests that uses social filters to bring up matches in your area and abroad. We need a fair site that matches you into an impersonal group chat of random people in which everyone in the group is a match but has never met before. The app should include a forum and chat for discussing feelings and ideas. The pre questionnaire should ask questions such as "would you say you are an introvert or extrovert?" and "do you prefer being around your own race and culture above having similar personalities and interests" and "are you A) a busy full time student, B) a settled long time employee, C) not sure what to do with your life. Every user should record a basic voice message pronouncing their name. Lastly there should be an advanced database of hobbies/interests where you can select for example "bodybuilding" or "assassins creed" or "Yu-Gi-Oh!" or "Lil Pump" or whatever else.</p>

        <p>I have many acquitances and very few friends.
When you realize that people only care about themselves, love hearing themselves speaking and most of them live in a fake cloud with no critical thinking or big goals. It's better to categorize them in the acquaintance category. The few exceptions are true friends and they're smart enough to understand what's going on in the world.</p>

        <p>I dont think this lockdown should be the reason to chose being without friends. If you will not be sure you want it, lonliness can stike Hard. </p>
<p>I dont have any friends, I would preffer only meeting few Times a year. So I am fine being without any. I am at the point, that i am proud to say i dont have any friends, not that i would walk around saying that to People.</p>
<p>I like being Free in every sence of the Word. When People get weird ideas, "society" tries to fix them in line. And I dont play by those rules. I like to Explore into unknown.</p>
<p>I think I ll have to leave society to live Free. Dont know if I can. From govorment side. Paper work enslaved us(kinda jk.)</p>

        <p>You need to go outside to find your new real friends. You'll know each other immediately by your mutually bare faces. The idea is to move all social relationships to virtual environments, which means it's time to go outside and see REAL people with REAL FACES. If you want to be extra sure that they are not embodied spy trolls looking for normal people to betray, offer a hug. It's like a secret handshake but less complicated. Any hug at all means you get to have society together.</p>

        <p>By the way, I was firmly removed from all of my old friendships by way of being called a whole range of insults (which we've all heard), but one of which included the insult of being "wholesome", and then there was also "poetic", I guess for suggesting that hugs and human warmth were healthy things. The old friends think huggers are grandma murderers, so, hooray for new friends! Hooray for rebel huggers and smilers!</p>
