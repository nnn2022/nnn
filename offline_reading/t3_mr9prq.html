    <strong>Relax. The "New Normal" will be basically the same as the old normal with one extra disease.</strong>
    <p><p>We lived our whole in a world filled with diseases that want to prey on us. We grew up with malaria, tetanus, rabies, influenza, and all mostly forgot the serious the ones we've vaccinated (mostly) out of existence (measles, polio, smallpox, etc.).</p>
<p>Nobody on any side is okay with this lasting forever. This has all been temporary measures while we roll out new vaccines to combat an emerging threat.</p>
<p>I've stayed in hard isolation with my partner for over a year now. But the vaccine is <em>out</em>. Basically all of them (except the sketchy Russian one) are safe. I got mine yesterday and I'm fine, no side effects or anything. It's just gonna take a month or two more to get enough people vaccinated to knock this thing out of circulation.</p>
<p>If three months from now the government is trying to force additional quarantine measures, I (and most of the other people supporting quarantine right now) will fight it. There's no need anymore, and things need to get back to <em>old</em> normal quickly. This year has been brutal on the economy and mental health, so we can't just keep stretching it out without reason.</p>
<p>The net result of all this will likely be a quadrivalent flu/covid vaccine every year instead of the trivalent flu vaccine we get today. Nothing crazy, just us adapting to an ever-changing world with new threats.</p></p>

        <p>We've never had a novel disease like this in living memory.</p>
<p>1918 did a number on the economy, that's the last time we dealt with something on this scale. </p>
<p>But that's why we have flu vaccines on the regular now. Humanity perseveres. Friendships, relationships, and community persevere, and we do it by learning and developing new weapons to fight a world that wants to eat us alive.</p>
<p>Relax, things have been shitty before and the "normal" you expect came out of it. We'll get back there.</p>

        <p>Well I wouldn't compare it to AIDS/HIV (identified in 1984) but we did get over that one too.</p>
<p>Or do you mean the book? They didn't really talk about vaccines in it. It was more about surveillance and war. Also as I recall it sold pretty well, solid for the economy on balance.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm talking about the book. And no matter what excuse the regime uses, the result is always the same. All dictators use the same tactic. They always use fear to enslave people, and when people want to resist, it's too late....</p>

        <p>Yes, clearly this is a devious plan by every country in the world at once to help Trump take over America.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's for the benefit of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the dictator of Thailand? Or Queen Elizabeth II, monarch of the UK?</p>
<p>When I start looking for conspiracy theories, I look for motive of all those involved. Why would countries like the Ukraine, Russia, Switzerland, Israel, and the UK all play into the same conspiracy? They have completely conflicting interests in regards to the US.</p>

        <p>Seriously though, what makes you think I'm a sheep? I'm questioning this potential conspiracy and trying to understand the motivations of people behind it.</p>
<p>To me, it makes no sense that those countries would work together. They all want to see the US do different things, and consider each other enemies.</p>
<p>Why aren't they breaking the truth at a national level to discredit their rivals? That seems like the much smarter play at this stage, especially if you're one of the smaller countries.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I know a lot of people don't. </p>
<p>I've gotten one almost every year since I turned 18, doing my part to help keep those diseases out of our country. (I missed a couple right after college, life was chaotic.)</p>
<p>But it's comparable because it killed almost 50MM worldwide and 650K in the US. It wrecked world economies, and we didn't have the kind of biotech infrastructure we had today to combat it so quickly. We just had to let it infect and kill until it burned itself out.</p>
<p>Flu vaccines being freely and widely available came directly out of all that death and suffering.</p>

        <p>Few phrases that makes me sick</p>
<p>"doing my part" is on of them...... doing your part in what?  giving up to aggressive propaganda and taking the injection you don't need to protect yourself from disease that can't harm you? And making all this rich old farts that benefit from this even richer?</p>
<p>Honestly, this fear of germs is the strangest and the most irrational mass psychosis I saw in my life.</p>
<p>You're young and you live your one and only life. You have 99+% chances to beat this virus but you have Zero chances to become younger. You will never be 17, 18 or 19 year old again.....Each moment of your life is priceless, and entire year of your life was just stolen from you, erased from your life. And you have Zero chances to have it back... And all you worry about is some common cold or flu? Not about how to get your normal life back?</p>

        <p>My life is already going back to normal, my dude. That's why I got vaccinated.</p>
<p>Couple buddies of mine got theirs a few weeks back, so now we can start hanging again. We had barbecue today. Few weeks from now I'll be in the same boat. And true, I (probably) wouldn't have died (despite my lung issues). But my mother very well might have, and I kinda like her. I'm okay with spending a year of my life sub-optimally for her to live a few more.</p>
<p>It's not like I didn't have <em>any</em> life. I learned new skills, made some new friends (who I plan to visit now) and founded a company. It's doing well these days, and I hope it will continue onward!</p>
<p>Like I said, I'm not going to support any sort of indefinite measures on this. My compliance was purely based on an understanding of how clinical trials and vaccines get done, and I was only accepting of a reasonable amount of time isolated to combat this thing.</p>
<p>The new normal will be the old normal, with a different label on the annual vaccines you refuse to take.</p>

        <p>Nobody forced me to do anything. I've just worked in immuno-oncology and have a pretty firm understanding of what's going on here, so I decided to stay isolated until the vaccine is out. (Based on what I've read, I prefer Moderna or Pfizer, fwiw. Their methods are the most specific and most similar, so I consider their tests as reinforcing each other.)</p>
<p>I like my mom and don't want her to die from COVID because I exposed her. I already lost a cousin (a nurse) to it. And I have a lung condition. </p>
<p>Given the risk factors it made sense for me to isolate.</p>

        <p>My cousin died from COVID at 27. She was a nurse, and died fighting for us on the frontlines. I'm not ready to just forget that sacrifice, and she did <em>not</em> only have 2 years left to live.</p>
<p>I am living my life. This year that life was tough, but by being careful I managed not to get infected. (I'm at high risk due to a lung condition, so I could easily have died from this thing myself even though I'm only 35)</p>
<p>I know I will die someday, but I'd prefer it not be to something as stupid as this.</p>

        <p>l dunno l could think of stupider ways to die. I cycle 1000 miles a month...pretty sure more likely l die from that as l haven't managed to get this very contagious virus in a year. Or if l got it l didn't even notice it. There's always outliers but l think people under 50 are more likely to die choking on the food in a restaurant that of the virus got from a restaurant.</p>

        <p>Stats say about 5k/year <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/527321/deaths-due-to-choking-in-the-us/">deaths from choking</a>, but I can't find anything broken down by age. I'd have to assume it skews to the v. young &amp; v. old, but don't like guessing.</p>
<p>We're at over <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">10k COVID deaths for the &lt;50 age range</a> already, though.

        <p>As if lockdowns and all the other draconian shit was necessary because "it's such a dangerous and deadly virus that needed to be contained". When will this false narrative completely die? No...this virus is not unprecedented. The insane, bizarre response to it is what is unprecedented. The way that all logic, reason, knowledge, common sense, and normal procedure for respiratory viruses was all flushed down the toilet in March of 2020...that is completely unprecedented. Mass hysteria on such a global scale...that is what is unprecedented.  Covid is a 0.15% IFR (infection fatality rate) virus that is only somewhat deadly to those with pre-existing and serious end-stage conditions. The human race has dealt with far, far worse before. No, it's not the pandemic that is causing this entire mess, the economic collapse, the societal destruction, the feelings of hopelessness and despair, all this is caused by the insanely out-of-proportion, bizarre, psychotic response to a 0.15% IFR virus...not the virus/pandemic itself.</p>

        <p>You're right, it mostly kills fat people and old people. That's a lot of the US, so we took it seriously.</p>
<p>I think your numbers are a little low. But even at 0.15%, if we let it spread wild to all 300M people in the US that's 450,000 dead Americans. That's WWII all over again, and I don't think that's something to just take lying down; there's a lot of old and/or fat people I happen to quite like. </p>
<p>Heck, in WWII those are the people we were fighting for: protecting our parents and those who were too weak to fight. I miss that america, the one where we were ready to do hard stuff to protect people who need it.</p>

        <p>Just so you know, I am basing my claims on serological IFR studies like this one (which is one of the most recent and comprehensive ones): <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13423">0.15-0.20% IFR overall and 0.03-0.04% IFR for those under 70 years old</a>.</p>
<p>And, no virus can ever infect 100% of the population...herd immunity kicks in long before that. Not even half the population will get covid (most likely only a fourth of the  population actually will).</p>
<p>The idea that covid is anything remotely like a death sentence for everyone who is elderly or fat is also completely false.</p>
<p>The vast vast majority of elderly people who get the virus will be fine. To put it simply, the people that covid is capable of killing, are people who would also die from the flu/pneumonia, or people that would have died from their one or more comorbidities within a year (those who have reached or are nearing, the end of their natural lifespan). Even in 80 year-olds, they still have a 94% chance of surviving - see below.</p>

<p>We're already at 500k+ excess deaths from this thing. If your numbers were right herd immunity should have kicked in around 225k, right? That's half of the 450k who would die at a 0.15% IFR.</p>

        <p>I was talking about the global overall IFR. It may vary a bit in different countries. </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind the that the number is highly inflated in the US, as they're counting every case and listing very frail and elderly people with several comorbidities as having died from a respiratory virus.</p>
<p>This is why you couldn't get tested for the flu, unless you had severe enough symptoms to be hospitalized. Imagine such a dumb joke as "please give me a test, I think I might have the flu! " What are your symptoms?" "Well...I don't have any." They are doing the complete opposite with covid, they want everyone to get tested all the time. It's beyond idiotic and insane. Imagine if prior to 2020 they had done mass testing for the flu. Your only symptoms are a scratchy throat and a few sniffles? Come get a test! Don't have a single symptom at all? Come get a test! You think they wouldn't be able to find a 100,000 cases in the US every single day if they did that? Hell, they would probably find 200-300k cases a day if they did. Testing for covid is like testing for a cold or flu virus...except they are treating it as if it were ebola, and each case had a 50% chance of dying. It's absolutely the most bizarre thing in modern history. </p>

        <p>&rt;they're counting every case and listing very frail and elderly people with several comorbidities as having died from a respiratory virus.</p>
<p>They aren't. \~500k tracks with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">excess deaths</a> for the year.</p>
<p><em>Something</em> definitely killed 500-600k extra people this year compared to the last decade or so. Unless there's been a _very_ productive serial killer running around, I feel it's safe to assume those are from COVID. If anything the numbers suggest they're slightly _underestimating_ the deaths (which makes sense, the blood clot thing was found relatively recently).</p>
<p>And again. I'm just counting deaths. Not positive rates, so testing doesn't really factor in. </p>
<p>500k is way above what your IFR and herd immunity numbers would suggest, so something is off in your basic assumptions.</p>

        <p>I would like to repeat, that I am not basing the IFR numbers out of thin air. They are based from dozens of serological studies that all make it clear that the actual number of those who contracted the virus is orders of magnitude higher than the official case count, which runs on pcr tests that only show active infections. The CDC itself said (around half a year ago) that the IFR is only 0.26% and could be lower as more studies are done in the years to come.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that you're trying to dismiss the global overall IFR rates with an outlier country (the US). </p>
<p>Excess deaths also don't equal covid deaths. Lockdowns have crashed the econony which caused increases in deaths from overdoses, suicidies, starvation, etc. Look it up. All these types of deaths have had a severe increase after March of 2020.</p>
<p>&rt;Testing doesn't really factor in. </p>
<p>The USA is at 942,635 tests per million. Why do you think the countries like Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, etc. supposedly "defeated" covid? It has something to do with the fact that they're all beneath 20.000 tests per million. </p>
<p>Also would like to add that no, there does not need to be widespread testing. PCR testing at this point is useless. They are doing it to continue the disinformation campaign and false narrative of "cases spiking" with deliberate misinformation. </p>
<p>"New found cases" mean absolutely nothing, as most are asymptomatic or mild. The obsession with increased pcr testing and the most mild cases getting tested shouldn't be surprising that cases increased. The truth is, they didn't increase. Covid was just always this widespread. </p>
<p>New cases is just a way for the media to keep up the shameless fearmongering bullshit. Active cases are only a small fraction of actual cases that will never be included in the confirmed count because those people no longer have the virus in their system. The focus now should be entirely on antibody and T-cell tests to get a real idea of the true numbers of those who contracted the virus. PCR testing should be like what is done for the flu....reserved for only those with the most severe symptoms. Not people with no symptoms. Not people with a runny nose or a mildly scratchy throat or any other mild symptoms. Only those who have severe symptoms that require actual hospital care. </p>
<p>Not to mention that it is absolutely a violation of rights to quarantine people for two weeks for a mild respiratory virus. If you're sick with symptoms, you stay home till you feel better...just like you would for the flu. If you have been around someone with covid but you're not sick, then you don't need to stay home. This is not ebola. The moment society gains some sanity and stops treating it as if it were, is the moment that things can get back to normal. Otherwise, it is an endless cycle of this hell. </p>
<p>The vast majority of cases will never be recorded because they were never tested at time of active infection. Now they either have antibodies or T-cell immunity. That is why pcr tests are useless agenda-driven bullshit at this point. At this point only serological testing matters. That is how epidemologists have always studied pandemics, but for some reason 2020 is bizarro Twilight Zone alternate reality where society forgets basic science and math and goes back to medieval quackery.</p>

        <p>Well again, I'm going by excess mortality numbers. A big ol' rant about PCR tests isn't really relevant.</p>
<p>Is there some alternate explanation for a half-million extra deaths in the US this year?</p>
<p>Either the whole world (friends and enemies alike) is conspiring together to produce remarkably consistent ratios of %positive covid tests and excess death rates, or there's actually a virus killing tons of people. </p>
<p>Given I've lost someone I've known my whole life to it, after she spent months pulling extra shifts due to all the extra people showing up and dying in her hospital. AND that I know several doctors in the same situation personally? I'm inclined to believe there's <em>some</em> sort of disease going around and killing an abnormally high number of people.</p>

        <p>As I said excess mortality numbers don't equal covid when you factor in the increases of deaths from suicide, overdoses and starvation due to economies being crashed as a result of numerous lockdowns. Funny how you conveniently ignored this part.</p>
<p>&rt;there's actually a virus killing tons of people. </p>
<p>Why are you moving goalposts now? I never said covid isn't responsible for the deaths of many. I just stated it isn't nearly as deadly as you believe it is - which multiple IFR studies (the ones you also ignore for some reason) confirmed.</p>

        <p>Okay, I'm fine with that. Not trying to move goalposts, you've just been vague. I can't tell how much you think the number is off by.</p>
<p>What number of people do you think COVID has killed, and what's your basis for that number? I can't find any stats on suicide for 2020/2021 so I can't factor that into my math, but I'm happy to take a look at any sources you have.</p>

        <p>What freedoms? I haven't given up any.</p>
<p>I was perfectly free to leave my house all year. I mostly chose to stay quarantined because I felt it was safer. Now I've got my vaccine and I feel safe going out again. I broke it a few times for things I thought were important (giving blood, and seeing my aunt after she lost her daughter to COVID)</p>
<p>And like I said, I'm not ready to accept shit past that. I'm just pointing out that this isn't as unprecedented as it feels. It's just new in our lifetimes.</p>

        <p>0.3% if allowed to spread is up to 900,000 dead Americans. That's two WWII's (or three hundred 9/11's, if you'd like a modern comparison). Yeah, it's mostly old and fat people, but I happen to <em>like</em> a few old and/or fat people. I'd happily go to war to defend them, but war won't help right now.</p>
<p>We had a response exactly like this over the 1918 influenza pandemic. Masks and all. You can even find pictures of people wearing masks to Dodgers games. And yet, what you think of as "old normal" came out of that.</p>
<p>Relax. We're passing through it. Nobody wants this to stick around.</p>

        <p>Okay then. Let's talk in Vietnams / Flu Years.</p>
<p>COVID has killed over 500,000 Americans so far. That's 10x the <em>highest</em> annual flu deaths of the last decade, closer to 25x the typical year. And we vaccinate against the flu, so it'd be higher without that.</p>
<p>Medical malpractice deaths are hard to pin down, because they're subjective. How small a mistake counts is the biggest variable. A slight delay in deciding treatment? Technically a mistake and counted in the studies with big numbers, but not what I think we're imagining when we say "medical malpractice". </p>
<p>Numbers I can find range from 7k/year to 250k/year, and I'm inclined to believe the truth probably lies closer to the low end. COVID is up to ~500k, so double the higher number. </p>
<p>That makes COVID America's new #3 cause of death, between unintentional accidents and cancer.</p>

        <p>&rt;We had a response exactly like this over the 1918 influenza pandemic. </p>
<p>No we didn't. The response the 1918 flu recieved is not nearly comparable to what we have now and the circumstances were entirely different. </p>
<p>First of all, 1918 flu was far worse / severe and of course in a different time. The IFR for the the Spanish flu was around 2% and it was also mostly young people who died...the average 1918 flu death was 29, while the IFR for covid is 0.15% &amp; average age of a covid death is 80+, and around the age of life expectancy in the West.</p>
<p>Secondly, the response to Spanish Flu was never this draconian/ dystopian.</p>
<p>Also...they wore masks for a few months then it was all back to complete normal and no one wore or so much as mentioned masks again. But this fight we're in...it's totally different. There was no 24/7 news or internet or social media back then. There wasn't tons and tons of blatant misinformation being spread to hundreds of millions around the country and globe in seconds. There weren't shutdowns and destruction of society and economy on such a massive scale (some businesses closed and events/activities were cancelled, which happened in 1918, but no where near this madness). There was no talk of "new normal" and all that bullshit.  That's what makes this covid thing completely different. These draconian measures (lockdowns) we now have, have also managed to destroy society in unprecedented ways literally overnight.  </p>
<p>Also. How long did people feel like they were actually in a pandemic? Months. Between fall of 1918 and early spring 1919. Did it last for years? Nope. This is why I am completely against going along with this and playing this stupid game.</p>

        <p>I mean, I can talk about IFR. I have in other posts in this thread.</p>
<p>I just don't see a point unless you have something specific about it. You all know the stats, they haven't changed much in a year. </p>
<p>Efficacy of vaccines seems much more important at this stage. If your vaccine is 90%+ effective, it doesn't matter much if your IFR is 0.1% or 10%. It'll never spread. Herd immunity is a killer for viruses. I just prefer the vaccines method of getting there to the let-people-die-until-the-disease-burns-itself-out method.</p>

        <p>It was about 6 months (October 1918 to March 1919) so we're really not that much more, given that we just hit one year in March.</p>
<p>And they took basically the same measures. Closed public streetcars, theaters, bars, schools, etc. It was wildly unpopular then too. They even had their own mass-media equivalent advocating for mask wearing <em>(even though the gauze masks they wore weren't very effective at dealing with viruses. But this was while they were still working out the germ theory of disease, so we should cut them some slack)</em></p>
<p>This was a common rhyme children of the time learned:</p>
<p><em>Obey the laws</em><br>
<em>And wear the gauze</em><br>
<em>Protect your jaws</em><br>
<em>From Septic Paws</em></p>
<p>There's whole <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2862334/">papers written</a> about it, like that one from H1N1 days, trying to see what worked then and apply it today.</p>
<p>The world we both grew up in came out of that. No need to panic. Things are getting better again.</p>

        <p>So you are gonna ignore simply the fact that it was 10 times more severe and ended half a year faster? Without the collosal damage to every facet of society? Without the biggest wealth transfer in history? Ok...</p>

        <p>It was <em>massively</em> damaging to society. People mourned for years. My grandma used to talk about it, all the back-funerals they held because funerals weren't allowed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yes, it was faster and more brutal. I'm so glad we were spared something like that and this one is a bit slower. With today's population density, that sort of disease could have killed millions just in the US.</p>
<p>The wealth transfer bit I 100% agree is bullshit. But I don't think that makes the virus fake or the cure fake. It's just capitalists exploiting a real scenario.</p>
<p>EDIT: That said, the maximum income tax in 1918 was a whopping <strong>77%</strong> for the ultra-wealthy. If your concern is fighting wealth transfers like they did, you should vote to bring that sort of policy back.</p>

        <p>The 1918 pandemic was really as bad as a highly contagious virus could get. However, keep in mind the time period in which it occured (World War I, most people lacked access to basic amenities, hospitals and medical practices are now way more advanced, lots of deaths in 1918 from secondary bacterial pneumonia which today's antibiotics would prevent, etc) If it happened today, it would have most likely only have had 10% (or less) of the death toll it did. </p>
<p>Also there is no cure for viruses, only our own immune systems cure them. The immune system is literally the only way to actually fight a virus effectively. That is all vaccines do, stimulate the immune system to make specific antibodies against a specific pathogen. Only bacterial infections can be cured by antibiotics.</p>

        <p>Agreed, all around! Unless you're trying to nitpick my use of the word "cure" instead of "vaccine"?</p>
