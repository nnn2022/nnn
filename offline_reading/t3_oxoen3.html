        <p>It’s too late to “sway” me. There have been too many lies and manipulation by the government, mainstream media and our institutions. </p>
<p>I don’t tolerate that kind of behavior in my personal life, why should I tolerate it anywhere else?</p>

        <p>If the governments of the west stood up and took responsibility.  If they admitted they lied.  That they used fear to control us.  That masks and lockdowns never worked.  If they said the young and healthy don't need vaccines.  If they said they made mistakes, but they meant well.  If they stopped the censorship and propaganda.  But they aren't doing any of that.  Instead they are mandating vaccines.  They are blaming the unvaccinated.  They are trying to divide us</p>

        <p>Yes.  I ask the exact same question in the opposite direction.  I ask people, what would it take for you to see that things have gone too far?  If the police came to my house and took me away to a medical facility where they forcefully vaccinated me?  Would you see yet?  It's equally accusatory and insulting.</p>

        <p>I used to laugh at some of the conspiracy theories that are out there.  I could understand the JFK assassination and 9/11 theories, I didn't necessarily believe them but I thought they were plausible.  But when people talked to me about microchips etc i thought that was a bit silly.  But here we are, all these years later, and they have found a way to give us all 'passports' that restrict our movements depending on how well we have complied with the government's demands.  It is exactly the same as the microchip theory that 'whack jobs' like Alex Jones have been warning us about for decades.  Can it really be an accident?  Or was this always the plan?  My mental health is taking a real nose-dive contemplating this shit.</p>

        <p>I've never really looked in to it much, but I think the idea is everyone gets a tiny implant the size of a grain of rice, and it allows the government to track your every move, and decide what 'privileges' you have.  As far as I know, covid passports are only on our phones, but they serve the same purpose.  Your government can 'switch off' your privileges if you don't get your vax, or your booster.  And then what's next?  What if they switch off your passport because you spread 'misinformation'?  Or because you are a political opponent? Because you are difficult? Because you voted for the wrong party?</p>

        <p>I think you have misunderstood me. I never said that the vaccines had microchips. I said that the vaccine passports serve the same purpose.  They achieve the same goal, to control the world population by tracking their movements and restricting their ability to participate in society if they don't comply with government demands.</p>

        <p>I have an MS in biostatistics and have worked in clinical research and for pharma companies for a decade now. I trust my knowledge, which is definitely more extensive than a layman’s to say the least.</p>
<p>Honestly, my position from the start was pretty uncontroversial (so I thought) - I just wanted to wait for more data, but the more it’s pushed, the more I reject it. I’ve seen pharma teams push this hard before during Open Label Extensions and each time it’s because they’re deeply insecure about the basis of their research. I think it’s still good for old and overweight people to get vaccinated. I don’t think it’s worth it for young and healthy people, especially women considering children, to get it.</p>

        <p>Summarizing all the information I have obtained within a reasonable timeframe and within a reddit-post seems out of question for me.</p>
<p>I'd like you to specify your question to something of which you think the answer can be summarized in a few sentences.</p>
<p>I mean to keep it on that broad and general level, I could say that I have obtained information that was actually aligned with what my personal experience was and not just the information that contradicted my own perception.</p>
<p>And that the longer I kept observing and comparing that information with my own experience, the more confident I became in that information to be a much better depiction of reality than the other information, which deviated more and more from my perception.</p>

        <p>I have already been swayed. This is the already-swayed me.<br>
I used to believe the narrative for about a month back in march 2020 until started smelling lies. </p>
<p>I was a good little girl who stayed home, did my zoom school, masked everywhere, sanitized etc. <br>
It started when "2 weeks to flatten the curve" became 3, then 4. I stopped wearing the masks when they were starting to be pushed in more and more places. I quit sanitizing when I realized that a fucking airborne virus that apparently spreads by breathing doenst give a crap if my hands are clean. I stopped doing zoom meetings and friends that refused to meet in person i just quit seeing.<br>
As more and more time went on and more and more insanity occurred I went from a good obedient follower to gradually more of a skeptic.  </p>
<p>Too many  promises were broken:</p>
<ul>
<li>The government promised us 2 weeks. Then 1 month. It's been over a year now. </li>
<li>When the government promised masks would never become compulsory, then made them compulsory. </li>
<li>When they promised us the would not be a curfew, then they made a curfew. </li>
<li>When a professor of high court law said tot he government "hey this curfew and these mask mandates are against the law you must end them NOW, and the government said "No we do as we like" and extended the curfew further. </li>
<li>When they said we wouldnt be obligated to get vaccinated, but then started a campaign to shame young people into getting vaccinated and made it so you cant go anywhere without one to the point it's pretty much obligated now if you want to have a life.   </li>
</ul>
<p>That's what it took to sway me.  What will it take to sway YOU?</p>

        <p>I hear you mentioning hard evidence and professional opinion. I assume that means you are asking for  proof/data/facts/research, which i can deliver. From universities, and research labs and from countries all over the world. <br>
It's a big library of sources I'm gonna dump below but feel free to have a  long hard look.  6 pages of microsoft word in fact.   It includes links and some descriptions and interpretations of what you will find int hose links. Good luck being swayed! </p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of my links are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social distancing doesn't work by MTI https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks: not .gov links so take them with a grain of salt:</p>
<p>https://www.massnurses.org/health-and-safety/articles/infectious-diseases/p/openItem/3201</p>

<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>Covid19 is a virus with a 99.85% survival rate and an IFR of .15%. In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth.</p>

<p>Also, public masking does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Studies have been done for 100 years since the Spanish Flu on using public masking to prevent viral spread, and not once has there been any evidence to show they work. In fact, all studies show just the opposite.</p>

        <p>&rt; Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Don't care about a video</p>
<p>&rt;Social distancing doesn't work by MTI https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>You're taking them out of context. MIT suggests that distancing depends if you're indoors -- Which is true and why places have maximum capacity limits. Furthermore, the distancing is based on the minimum distancing, not the best distance. The best distance would be to stay at home. </p>
<p>"The 1.83m rule is used in various forms around the world: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises 1.83m of separation indoors and outdoors, while in the UK the figure is 2 meters. In much of Europe, the figure is 1 meter, which is also recommended as a minimum distance by the World Health Organization."</p>
<p>So that's one you've taken out of context already. We'll play this on a 3-strike rule to save everyone some time. When presenting information, you should put your absolute best sources forward. The best is to use 3, no more, no less. </p>
<p>&rt;https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m20-6817</p>
<p>The first sentence, "It is uncertain"</p>
<p>"Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others."</p>
<p>Strike 1. </p>
<p>&rt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/</p>
<p>This is the Common Cold, not Covid. During Covid, both the Nurse and the Patient would be masked. </p>
<p>Furthermore, this study notes: Prevention of <strong>upper respiratory infection</strong> is one reason given, although evidence of effectiveness is lacking. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7237932/">Covid manifests in the lower respiratory system</a></p>
<p>Strike 2. </p>
<p>&rt;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-%20review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05</p>
<p>Same dealio. This isn't about Covid, but about Influenza. </p>
<p>And again, like the others, the study blatantly makes it known: Our review highlights the limited evidence base supporting the efficacy or effectiveness of face masks to reduce influenza virus transmission. </p>
<p>Strike 3. </p>
<p>If the first portion of your sources is them being taken out of context or not applicable, the rest will most likely be the same. </p>
<p>So please give me your absolute best, your infallible evidence, your jaw-dropping bombshells. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)#Rhetoric_and_public_speaking">And please, keep it to 3.</a> Much more convincing.</p>

<p>&rt;The use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled Our Masters' Voices, gives examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause. Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech "Non-Violence and Racial Justice" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: "insult, injustice and exploitation", followed a few lines later by "justice, good will, and brotherhood".</p>

-&rt; Bahli in Sweden, recognizing the lack of evidence supporting the use of masks, ceased requiring them in 2010 for anesthesiologists and other non-scrubbed personnel in the operating room. “Our decision to no longer require routine surgical masks for personnel not scrubbed for surgery is a departure from common practice. But the evidence to support this practice does not exist,” wrote Dr. Eva Sellden. https://pubs.asahq.org/anesthesiology/article/113/6/1447/9572/Is-Routine-Use-of-a-Face-Mask-Necessary-in-the<br>

        <p>Risk of masks?  Clearly you didn't read the WHO guidance carefully or you don't understand what they're saying.  There is no risk with mask wearing for the average user.  There is significant benefit to wearing masks.  All the better to encourage better quality masks such as N95s.  You all try so hard to justify your beliefs, but you're just so wrong.  Disturbingly wrong.  There's clear indication that you have trouble with context, data, and making unwarranted assumptions and conclusions.</p>

        <p>My beliefs are based off my upbringing and life experiences thus far all culminated together and called upon to make the best decision possible.. everything I have absorbed, all cross referenced together and updated as nessicary, in order to best suit my current environment.</p>
<p>I can only live and update as necessary, by proccesing fact, experience, knowledge, and my current environment.  My beliefs may or may not change based on how much each category is affected, in every moment of every day.</p>
<p>Edit: End goal would be to never peak. Never stop absorbing new information. Never give up, and not become so closed minded, I'm no longer able to make the best informed decision.</p>
