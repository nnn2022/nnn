    <strong>Diseases defeated by vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>So, this is a legitimate inquiry, if someone has a good answer please fell free to educate me.</p>
<p>In the past, humans have created vaccines against certain diseases, yes? Smallpox, Polio, we have eliminated these diseases through vaccines. My understanding is that we have destroyed these diseases because vaccination made it so they no longer had a human host to infect and spread through, inoculation starved them of their ability to function. Now, as we know, the new MRNA Covid vaccine doesn't prevent people from contracting or spreading the disease, it is meant to simply reduce symptoms. Functionally, how is this vaccine expected to achieve the same effect as the Polio or Smallpox vaccines? How is it going to be possible to eradicate a disease with a vaccine that doesn't prevent contraction or transmission? Am I missing something or does the entire narrative break down when you look at it like this?</p></p>

        <p>It won't. In fact, it could have the opposite effect in that it may force the virus to evolve into new variants to get around it, not entirely unlike antibiotic resistance with bacteria.</p>
<p>And if asymptomatic spread is a thing, and the vaccines reduce symptoms, it'll give the vaxxed a sort of false confidence to go out into public while they're infected whereas someone who's unvaxxed will actually feel sick and quarantine themselves (if they're smart).</p>
<p>The vaccines could prolong this shitshow.</p>

        <p>Not entirely true. Polio was never defeated, never irradiated. The spread of polio however was lessen to almost non existence in the west through sanitation, water treatment and better waste water management. Polio is spread through fecal-oral transmission. Actually in the third world the vaccine is actually spreading polio. </p>

        <p>It’s not a vaccine, it’s an instruction manual of an untested device. It’s telling your body how exactly function without consider that every body is different. </p>
<p>A vaccine, until where I ever knew, is a disabled virus, a training doll, so your body can learn from it, studying and practicing, and in the event of a true situation, your soldiers know how to act properly, considering all the terrain and equipment which are every individual body. </p>
<p>Now with this bioengineering project, they are giving a manual to the soldiers with zero practice. A lot of theories of how to combat an enemy the soldiers never saw without considering all the variables conditions of the body.</p>
<p>It if we consider that’s what they are indeed doing. I don’t even want to speculate if there’s something else in a tool that can manipulate DNA.</p>

        <p>You are correct. Also, it's not necessary to indiscriminately vaccinate the entire population, so they're wrong about that too. IIRC in the late stages of the smallpox eradication campaign, they found it was more effective to target specific at-risk individuals or groups rather than trying to keep rates up for everybody</p>
