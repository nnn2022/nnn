    <strong>I'd love to change the world (but I don't know what to do)</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like ranting a bit. Like many of you, I've been struggling throughout this pandemic, and have been frustrated at the constantly moving goalposts. I've had to constantly convince myself "just wait a few months, people will get fed up with this, things will change"</p>
<p>The last thing I've told myself is "just get through the holidays, things will probably start to get better by the start of the year, and definitely by spring." But I'm growing increasingly impatient.</p>
<p>Simply put, i don't want to stay at home, play video games and watch Netflix anymore to kill time. I'm sick if it. I want to do SOMETHING.</p>
<p>If there were anti protests here (I'm in CA) I'd be there in a heartbeat, and my life would feel it would start to have a meaning or purpose again. It's really the only thing I care about right now.</p>
<p>But the aren't protests here. Nothing. Everyone walks around masked up like zombies and... That's it. This is just life now.</p>
<p>I wish i were leadership material, i would try to get something organized. I've always lived like thinking there were always people smarter than me and more passionate about than me about serious issues that i could rally behind. But as far as i can tell, that doesn't exist. I seem to be the only one who cares.</p>
<p>What the fuck can i do, besides vent on reddit? I can't take this kind of existence much longer. Sorry to be dramatic, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>Tl;dr - I'm bored of sitting at home and want to make a change in this fucked up clown world. But i don't know what to do, especially if no one else in the world seems to be on my side.</p></p>

<ol>
<li>Get ProtonMail and Mullvad VPN. Mullvad specifically, because it isn't party to any Five Eyes agreements and you can pay in cash (literally, you can mail notes to Norway and they'll credit your account).</li>
<li>Start reading activism and information warfare manuals. I recommend <em>The Irresistible Revolution</em>; <em>The Coming Insurrection</em>; <em>On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century</em>, and <em>Direct Action and Sabotage</em>. Very, very different books, but all practically-minded and liveable.</li>
<li>Learn and practice money-saving and self-sufficiency. That includes life skills like growing food; sewing; herbal medicine; basic code.</li>
<li>Spread this info and help others: reduce overall communal dependency on corporations and the state. (Just don't go nuts with the herbal medicine.)</li>
<li>Select some virtues and live according to them without wavering for any lesser desire. They make your existence real, as far as the outside world is concerned. Your virtues separate you from mere rational material interest. Be someone's hero. Start with yourself.</li>
<li>Prefer disengaging with coercive power to physically challenging or humiliating it. You'll get further.</li>
<li>Don't debate: just ask why and if a person is sure there's not another way. It's a standard tactic for de-escalating religious radicalisation (taught to me by an ex-jihadi who is now a counter-terror advisor to UK police).</li>
<li>Never reveal your action points on the Internet. These are all valid but I don't do them. Will you? Who knows? Not Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos...</li>

        <p>You could start a protest. You donâ€™t need to be a verbose, bombastic orator with an existing following to be a leader. Lead by example.</p>

        <p>Changing the world is a big task. I'd start by changing your own world first - have you thought about moving to a state or area that is more free? I understand not everyone is in the financial position to do this but if you are able to I think it would be an improvement. Red states are generally less likely to go along with covid dictates. Start saving, get into cryptos and gold. I also would start a mutual aid group and see if you can find people that are against this insanity where you are, I guarantee you are not the only one even if you feel you are, they are probably just waiting for someone else to make the first move.</p>

        <p>There would be more protests, but because of censorship, the groups that organize them are quashed.</p>
