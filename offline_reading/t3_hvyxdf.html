        <p>This...is not good news. It'd be good news if Hydroxychloroquine was widely used, and not stigmatized the way it is. As is, it's worthless because people fear it, and most doctors won't touch it now. Trust me, I spent a good portion of March studying and promoting it on Reddit, and that was a huge failure.</p>

        <p>Despite the Media Lies – Study Shows Hydroxychloroquine Can Provide a 50-70% Chance of Recovery from the China Coronavirus - Despite what you previously heard about Hydroxychloroquine’s ineffectiveness for fighting the COVID-19 virus, new studies provide almost overwhelming proof of the opposite.  Everyone owes it to themselves and their loved ones to do their homework so they understand the real truth about current treatment options based on the most timely and credible information. For yours and your loved ones sake,  I urge you to not make a life and death decision based on politics or inaccurate news reporting. The (https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30534-8/fulltext#) peer reviewed refereed study,  published July 2, 2020, in one of the most prestigious and relevant-to-COVID-19 medical journals in the world, the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, has just found that in fact administering Hydroxychloroquine by itself early during a hospitalization cuts down death rate by half from the raw data.  The study’s multi-variable analysis, which attempts to apply logical weights for other influencing factors, is even more positive stating “In the multivariable Cox regression model of mortality using the group receiving neither hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin as the reference, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone decreased the mortality hazard ratio by 66% (p &lt; 0.001), and hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin decreased the mortality hazard ratio by 71% (p &lt; 0.001).” These are very significant positive outcomes.”  Stated another way – who would not want to increase their odds of survival by 50-70%?</p>

        <p>I wonder if the analysis by  Science Based Medicine (SBM) is comparing apples to oranges?</p>
<p>As I understand it, Risch is advocating for patients to use HCQ with AZM and ideally zinc who have not been hospitalized. The two studies cited by SBM refuting the claims of Risch don't follow the same methods.</p>
<p>Study 1: <em>Hydroxychloroquine with or without Azithromycin in Mild-to-Moderate Covid-19</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The treatment group was hospitalized which rules out this study as a valid comparison/rebuttal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Study 2: <em>Hydroxychloroquine for Early Treatment of Adults with Mild Covid-19: A Randomized-Controlled Trial</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In this study, HCQ was used a standalone without AZM or Zinc, which rules out this study.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other negative about the analysis is that it engages in ad hominem attacks. for example: "<em>Hilariously, he relies heavily on uncontrolled 'studies' and case series from two grifters, Didier Raoult and Vladimir Zelenko</em>." This type of expression detracts from an honest evaluation of the central proposition offered by Risch.</p>
<p>So from my perspective, the analysis offered by Science Based Medicine doesn't offer any evidence critiquing the proposition that a HCQ/Zinc/AZM combination taken in the early stages of the disease BEFORE hospitalization is an effective treatment. The treatment may not be effective but this article does offer a rational, reasoned counter argument, which is disappointing. It's basically just throwing insults and unrelated criticisms at the proposal, which does not add any clarity to the situation at all, which is disappointing considering the expertise of the author (MD, PhD, FACS).</p>

        <p>I think Gorski could have provided some reference to his main tennant which goes to the heart of the Risch argument as you pointed out here. Gorski states: </p>
<p>"Moreover, his argument is bullshit, plain and simple. If a drug strongly inhibits coronavirus replication, there’s no reason that it <strong><em>couldn’t</em></strong> be effective both in advanced disease and in early disease—or even as a prophylactic treatment to prevent infection."</p>
<p>I cannot qualify that statement.  </p>
<p>I don't necessarily agree though with your position that Gorski is simply using ad hominem attacks. In SBM and science in general, it all comes down to the analysis of study and often to the very methodologies used. Here Gorski critiques Risch's analysis based on his reference to poorly conducted studies and studies which have been proven inaccurate. I think that goes to the core of Risch's analysis which discredits his credibility to argue any virtue into these studies. </p>
<p>In full disclosure I have no researched any of these studies nor do I have the expertise to provide independent analysis. </p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>

        <p>Thanks for giving feedback. I appreciate the fact that you read my post and responded to it.  Maybe a HCQ/AZM/Zinc treatment for a pre-hospitalization stage will not work, but I don't think anything Gorski writes addresses that particular issue, nor does anything else out there that I've come across (admittedly I'm just scanning the info though).</p>
<p>It seems like the argument against the use (even from Fauci) is 1) no clinical, double blind, controlled studies support it's use and in fact refute it (BUT none of the studies don't actually look at the particular use case, which I never hear anyone acknowledge) and 2) the current data supporting the use is observational (which is true).</p>
<p>So the sum of the supporting evidence, to date, is observational which causes many providers to rule out using it as a treatment which is their prerogative. I read that the results of controlled studies will be out in September. That will be interesting. In the meantime, if I were to get Covid, I would want (not sure if I could get it) a treatment of HCQ/AZM/Zinc.</p>
<p>What concerns me is that this may not be possible in my circumstance, as I do not know if my physician would prescribe it.</p>
<p>My motivation for responding to this post, is that by sharing my point of view with the information I have, it would be more likely that this treatment option will be available to those who want it. It is not offered to counter those that doubt its efficacy, unless they are so strident in their opposition to it that they would deny it to others via their own personal powers (e.g., a provider who would refuse to prescribe it) or via influence in another manner (e.g., pushing so organizations like health systems (this is happening), governments, etc. will not allow it). This is something that I think is wrong at this time. Based on the "evidence" or information I have, I think this option should still be a therapeutic choice for myself and others. It seems like the tone of the Gorski's analysis is to not only refute the utility of the treatment (fair), but remove it as an option for others which I disagree with.</p>
