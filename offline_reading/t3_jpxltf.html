    <strong>I’ve typed up Biden’s Acceptance Speech! Get ready guys! Utopia is within our reach!!!</strong>
    <p><p>Hello fellow communists!     <br>
Are you excited?    <br>
The government is going to take away all of our freedoms and teach us what’s good for us! It’s going to be great! </p>
<p>We’ll start with face muzzles mandated in all homes <em>(with a government camera pointed at you to ensure truthfulness)</em> and enforced lockdowns by welding people into their homes. Make sure to call our hotline if you see anyone trying to break these rules or displaying any hint of irregular thought. We will toss them into a mandatory re-education camp immediately. </p>
<p>Remember, half of America voted for this. So we should force the other half to comply by any means necessary! It’s for their own good and to turn them into a health, happy human being! Smoking, drinking, drugs, eating processed foods, and wearing masks are all healthy! The government cares about your health! That’s why we outlaw all unhealthy behaviors and arrest anyone who refuses to comply!! <em>(We would arrest people who commit suicide over lockdowns and masks, but they’ve already removed their irregular thoughts from existence by dying honorably for the cause.)</em></p>
<p>Once we’ve finished creating this perfect society by re-educating or executing anyone who doesn’t agree with us, we will have conquered death! No one will ever die again! The only reason we were ever dying was because of those racist, <strong>anti-science</strong> bigots voting for Trump! Anyone who hated Trump, but voted for him because they didn’t want to wear a mask or have a lockdown, will be executed for treason immediately, no re-education required. That kind of small-minded disloyalty is not to be tolerated. </p>
<p>Remember to worship anything Lord Fauci and our new Lord Biden says at all times, peace be upon them. Amen. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>All kidding aside, I hope someone in politics decides to resist like crazy for us now that Trump is gone, but I don’t have much hope left.</em></p></p>

        <p>Even if Trump is the Al Gore of this scenario, I hope that the litigation forces some real investigation into what went on with the vote counts, and leads to more transparent processes in the future. 2000 seems to have had that effect in Florida, and that's good regardless of who benefits politically in the short term.</p>

        <p>I do hope that Trump is able to prove something if something actually happened. Even if it doesn't help him win, maybe it can trigger a maelstrom for Voter ID or something so this never happens again.</p>
<p>Republicans: I've lost a lot of faith since it was mainly Florida, South Dakota, and Georgia that had a backbone. Everyone else folded like a house of cards.</p>

        <p>I'd be OK with mail-in as long as the person actually requested it and you can verify there's nothing fishy going on. I don't think it should be sent to someone too lazy to even request a ballot.</p>

        <p>No more mail in votes unless you’re a military member who’s deployed or have a true hardship that would prevent you from going to the polls. It’s amazing how everyone whines that going to the polls is so unsafe and will expose them to the Black Plague..I mean corona, but they have no problem getting takeout, having other people work so they can get deliveries and go to Walmart. But exercising their civil rights in person is the worst thing to ever happen to them. Little shits don’t know how good they have it in America. They should try living somewhere with a real dictator or where they don’t get to vote. They’ll learn to appreciate the country real quick instead of spewing their anti-America nonsense everywhere.</p>

        <p>I agree with this. How can we safely assume that these ballots were marked without outside interference or persuasion?</p>
<p>Absentee ballots should be very rare.. only for people out of the county etc... And even then, they should probably have to be notarized.</p>
