        <p>I‚Äôd say I was always a bit skeptical of vaccines merely in the sense that I felt they shouldn‚Äôt be necessary to live healthily. But in the last year I have become convinced that vaccines are poison and that they were always meant to be poison. </p>
<p>I see a lot of people prefacing their comments with ‚Äúnot anti-vax.‚Äù Personally, I think if you, based on your research of the facts, support vaccines, then go ahead and say so. If you do not, then say you don‚Äôt support them. But we shouldn‚Äôt be cowering away from the ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù like it‚Äôs the worst thing in the world</p>

        <p>This is a good post but I do want to make one thing clear. The reason I'm against the covid vaccine is because it's had no clinical trial for any substantial amount of time. Other vaccines found in the US have had years and years of trials done, so while no one should trust the covid vaccine I'd highly recommend all other proven vaccines. Really just be an adult and don't take drugs someone just threw together. I don't want people confusing us with anti-vax movements, we don't want children dying from preventable diseases. But we also don't want children dying from an unproven vaccine either. Just wanted to clear that up</p>

        <p>IMO: I‚Äôm just weirded out by the demands of vaccines in a time where everything is obvious. People in this sub can even be pro-covid vax (which some are) I could care less. It‚Äôs the push I‚Äôm concerned with. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù that‚Äôs a propagated term given to people who‚Äôd rather rely on their God given immune system rather than man-made supplements. I don‚Äôt trust sh*t at this point in this fallen world. If they‚Äôre messing with these shots they can mess with the rest if they need to complete their objective. Just like we see above. I don‚Äôt trust none of it - my daughter is healthier than all the other kids who are sick and hospitalized consistently like my in-laws kids. She has the brightest eyes and started walking at 8 months - pretty nuts. So I will take a beautiful pass on any future Vax and trust in Gods word. It‚Äôs been working out very well for my family. I haven‚Äôt been sick in 15 years and no updated vaxxes for me since. You can do whatever you like and the sub can promote whatever they like unless it‚Äôs demands then I‚Äôm not with it. If it‚Äôs demanding it can take itself to the trash can. I trust in my God and His word. And you best know I‚Äôm not injecting anything that came from fetal DNA into myself. Which makes up so many of these supposed life saving vaccines that always came out towards the end of these viruses life spans.</p>

        <p>That's all well and good but some vaccines are important. There is a middle ground between no vaccines and all vaccines. But risking your child's life dude? What the hell? I'm Christian and I don't see a single word in the Bible that says "do not use modern medicine to prevent your child's death". I'm all for grown ass people choosing not to get any vaccines, they are mature enough to make that choice. But a child is a whole nother story. I don't think God wants our children dying from disease that we have actually vaccines for. But the covid vaccine isn't proven yet, which is why I and many others refuse to get it. We all still get other proven vaccines and make sure our kid gotten vaccinated too. Because I can guarantee you, more kids die from the diseases than the vaccines, by a large amount. Vaccines aren't some mythical government mind control device used to enslave humanity</p>

        <p>I never said they were used to enslave humanity. I‚Äôm not risking my child‚Äôs life it‚Äôs wild that you think like that. One of my in-laws kids has a lung problem after getting all his vaccines he has to be hospitalized every now and then when his system acts up. The thing is you have more faith in Man than you do God. Do you know any unvaccinated people? I know people my age who were never vaccinated and they‚Äôre fine and grew up never getting super sick or disabled. I have friends with unvaccinated children that are now 8-12 and they also never get sick and are the most fit children in their neighborhoods. I can tell you that the Bible says time over time how true faith in God will cure or prevent sickness. Do you believe in Gods power and the nature He gave you? I do, and it works greater than all of mans power and nature.</p>
<p>You are being tested. You either have faith in Man or in God. If you think it‚Äôs okay to load up babies with 30 injections - you do you when you get your child. </p>
<p>Vaccinated kids can still get the diseases they were vaccinated for - it‚Äôs just a lot of these viruses died out so it‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äúthe vaccines worked‚Äù when they were created at the end of the death cycle, which is what I guarantee they‚Äôll do with this one while burying  the deaths and disabilities that come with as they always have - well now it seems like they brought polio back so there‚Äôs that. You can either have faith in your man made jabs or faith in God. I choose God. If you want to try and do both go for it.</p>
<p>Find me a bible verse that says it‚Äôs okay to use cells pulled from dead babies to cure your sickness and you might have me, other than that I advise you read:</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.‚Äù James 5</p>

        <p>I love how the lord dares bless us with the fine men and women who we needed to create vaccines to combat mortality rates in kids as well as the ingredients to do so and you spit in his face. You ain't no Christian, you worship the Bible more than you worship Jesus Christ. That books written by man and everything man does is to his own will. All we can put our trust in is in Jesus Christ and his works, and I challenge you to find a single example of Jesus refusing to heal a child when he has the power to. Anything other than actual factual events Jesus was related to can be corrupted by man. I put my faith entirely in the Lord, not in a book written by old men who may or may not have written in some of their own ideas. I don't believe in anecdotal evidence, I believe in facts. Facts like theirs only 2 genders and one sexuality, the rest being a bunch of mental disorders. Facts like the climate ain't burning up no more than it does regularly throughout history. Facts like evolution, although i see it as the hand of God creating life rather than by accident. You wanna deny Facts I'll lump you right up with every other Yankee fuck who thinks there's 200 genders and enough sexual preferences to fill hell with sinners</p>

        <p>I couldn't bring myself to vaccinate my kid at all and I know I had planned it because I was brainwashed. During the last month or two of my pregnancy, I was telling someone how stupid I thought "anti vaxxers" were when suddenly my brain flashed me a memory. I actually had a vaccine damaged cousin that I hadn't seen in over ten years and barely saw growing up. She was born healthy, but after an infant shot she developed a dangerous fever and convulsions. After that she was brain damaged and epileptic. I called another cousin to confirm it and he told me that "yes she was confirmed vaccine damaged, but it was a one in a million chance so just get your kid vaccinated"üò± I researched for months because I wanted to vaccinate to keep my kid safe and I wanted to never vaccinate to keep my kid safe. Total. Mind. Fuck. I didn't vaccinate him until kindergarten (because NY) and by then they need so few shots. He even caught wild chicken pox the year before, so didn't need that one either. And he's crazy healthy. He's never had an illness last more than a day. I get the flu every year and I don't think he's ever had it.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. I found all of this out when I started doing the research. At the time I was researching, Japan had noticed a higher infant mortality rate and had lowered their recommended vaccines for infants. That was extremely eye opening. I found out about VAERS and how vaccine manufacturers are no longer liable for injuries. I found out that the decline in deadly disease was mostly due to clean water and sanitation. It wasn't until I started questioning them that I noticed so many extremely loud PRO vaccine people who openly detested people who even questioned vaccines, but I did meet a few other vaccine questioners once my eyes opened. My ex supported my decision and thankfully still does. We're going to lawyer up if our jobs or the school tries to mandate these or the flu shot. I believe the flu shot is responsible for my Gramma's regular bouts of Bell's palsy and a nurse friend of mine's mother developed GBS from a flu vax and never recovered the use of her muscles. Scary shit.</p>

        <p>I've researched it my dude. It's called I'm not letting my kids die from preventable diseases because people want to push an agenda. You ain't any different from the fuckers pushing vaccines. Down vote me all you want but where im born and raised internet points don't mean shit but dead kids sure do. You want to push some massive government conspiracy that all vaccines are useless you be my fucking guess. But I pray God forgives your soul when you end up killing some kid because you think the governments loading every vaccine with crazy pills. The only agenda I push is not letting kids die and by God ill die on this hill before I let any Yankee fuck like you tell me my or any children ain't need vaccines when the God gave you the evidence to prove they work. You tell me a child dying from a preventable disease because your worried the government needs a shot to control you. Trust me bud, it ain't that hard to convince a population to do what you want. Look at how many blacks voted for Joe Biden. That's proof enough you ain't need no fake vaccines to control a population. No people do die from vaccines, but I guarantee that number is still less than the mortality rate of a preventable disease on the lose.</p>
