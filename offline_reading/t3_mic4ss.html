        <p>You think that he looks representative for the country with the highest obesity rates and almost the worst overall health?</p>
<p>Sorry but the America that you love does not exist anymore. America is now about big government, retraction of "freedumbs", unhealthy food, disease, obesity, being dependent, begging for government handouts, blind obedience, propaganda, fiat currencies, and other such lovely things. America has been sold to the Fed and is now the Fed's farm and the American people are the cattle on the farm. If nationality was your only pride then you have nothing left to be proud of anymore. America has been defeated and overtaken by corruption. This CoViD-19 plandemic may be the final nail in the coffin of the small fraction of freedom and dignity that Americans still had left.</p>

        <p>So what point were you making by mentioning your capability to fantasise about me not being extra-ordinarily big? Where you trying to start some kind of dick measuring contest? Is that what you fall back on when you run out of arguments? You must be a real intellectual.</p>
<p>A country's ideals can be seen from the country's fruits. America's fruits are slavery, dependence, corruption, disease, and big government. So by definition those things are American, because those are the things that are common in America. A silly dissing contest will not change that fact, it will merely serve to distract from it.</p>

        <p>None of those quotes are me saying to give up so you are just putting words in my mouth. Just because the American nationality has become a disgrace and the American government along with America's foundations have been corrupted beyond repair does not mean that people ought to give up on life. There is a lot one can still do; prepping, building up health, educating themselves, etc.</p>
<p>I just think that it is stupid to worship America and the American ideals in this day and age. You tell a tree by it's fruits, and so a country's ideals can be seen by looking at the fruits of the country.</p>
<p>For example, the American Dream. It is that any business can become successful not matter how small they are as long as they work hard and smart, right? So what are the fruits of America, what are it's true ideals? In America, big brother government is destroying small businesses and granting special privileges to big businesses. Those are the real ideals of America, those are the ideals America lives by.</p>
<p>So what about freedom? How free are Americans? How many Americans are fighting against the lockdown? Most are just obedient and even try to force lockdown on others. Modern America clearly hates "freedumbs", as they call it in America. Those are the fruits and thus the real ideals of modern America.</p>
<p>The first step to fixing a problem is by acknowledging it. If you keep lying to yourself about how great and free America is then you are giving up because you will never fix the problem without acknowledging it. I am saying to not give but to fix the problem, and the first step to fixing a problem is acknowledging it's existence.</p>
<p>And just for the record, what I say about America here goes for most countries nowadays. I am not specifically anti-American. America is not special in being anti-freedom, most countries are like that.</p>

<p>That is a loaded qoaded question. The question is invalid because it makes a false assumption, that being that I destroy the notion of truth. Therefore the question has no correct answer.</p>
<p>&rt;If you hate America so much, leave.</p>
<p>If people hate their country so much, why do they not leave their home, friends, family, and jobs behind in order to go to a completely unknown country where people speak another language and have a totally different culture to try to build another life there? Because emigrating like that is difficult, costly, and risky.</p>
<p>And on top of that there is the problem of where to go to. When you leave your country, you have to enter another country. I was talking about America because America was brought up, but most countries are about as bad as America is. So there is no place to go. Worldwide lockdown, remember? Almost every country participates.</p>

        <p>&rt; No surprise you don't know about it. You guys aren't exactly known for your intelligence or your fact-checking skills or even your willingness to try.</p>
<p>Do not know about what? Your original accusation was extremely vague. I destroy the notion of truth? That could mean anything. If you want to make a point about it then you will have to be more specific in order to make an actual argument instead of just making a vague unsubstantiated claim like you are doing now.</p>
<p>&rt;"Why don't I leave? Because it's hard and my these bullshit "values" of mine aren't worth it."</p>
<p>That is not what I said or implied.</p>
<p>First of all, who said that my values are to flee corrupt government? You implied it, but not me. The value of me that is relevant here is freedom. That includes the freedom to live with your family and friends in your country of birth. So actually giving up my life for the government as you suggest would be going against my values. How can I be free if I let the government dictate that I cannot live with my family and friends because I have to go to another country?</p>
<p>Secondly, you assumed that the problem was only that it was hard. Giving up friends and family may be hard, but even beyond that it is undesirable. In my case, I have family that needs us here. Leaving could kill them. A more important value of mine is to not abandon family that needs us. So my values mean that we must stay.</p>
<p>And thirdly, a corrupt government is the governments' moral failing. It is not the responsibility of people to keep giving up their lives and moving from country to country to flee corrupt governments, it is the governments that ought to not be corrupt at all. If the people are to do anything about it then it would be much better if they got rid of the corrupt government instead of giving up their own lives. Solve the problem instead of fleeing it.</p>
<p>And fourth, virtually every country is corrupt. So your solution would not even solve anything.</p>
<p>You seem to be making the case that if someone is not willing to give up their friends, family, jobs, house, culture, and almost everything else in their lives in order to live a live of uncertainty and hardship in another country, then he must think that his government is pretty good. So any government that is better than giving up everything is good? That is a pretty low bar. With such low standards it would be no wonder the American government is good in your opinion.</p>
<p>Or is your argument that if someone is not willing to give up their entire life for a life of uncertainty then they must not care about freedom? But how free are you when you not even free to live among your friends and family in your country of birth? You would be implying that having to give up your life is compatible with being free. But it is not. A free person is free to live in his country of birth.</p>
<p>So seeing those arguments, it is clear that not fleeing your country when your country has a corrupt government and while you value freedom makes perfect sense. Those three things are not contradictory nor mutually exclusive because not fleeing your country is exercising your freedom and a government better than giving up everything can still be very bad.</p>

        <p>&rt; Health replaced by pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>My boyfriend was involuntarily committed to the psych ward, and has been there for two weeks. He is so drugged up, he can't remember if he spoke to me just a day ago, and he once called three times in one day, genuinely thinking each call was the first time that day he spoke to me. He called one day, telling me how much he wants to go home and doesn't want to take the medicine, and days later, flip-flopped and said he's not being forced to stay and not being forced to take medicine. I had to spell out <em>multiple times</em> the inability to leave is the very definition of being held against your will, and if he has no choice in taking medication, yes, he is indeed being forced.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I'm unsure if it's solely the drugs, his way of thinking, or both. But if it's his own thinking, I understand how he became a doomer.</p>
<p>(For anyone wondering why he's not my ex, I've gone back and forth with that many times. Then, he was committed, and I feel wrong for wanting leave him while he's still there.)</p>

        <p>My best friend was committed to a psych ward 20 years ago.  The drugs they had been giving her destroyed her life.  I remember visiting her there on Christmas, thinking how is this happening? Before the ordeal she earned straight A's and was an incredible artist. They even gave her shots that ran the risk of her permanently drooling. </p>
<p>It was her THYROID the entire time.  It went on for months and months. They gave her all these terrible drugs, labeled her as bipolar and other crap but no one checked her TSH score.  O.o It was incredibly high.  She needed thyroid hormone replacement, not frigging psych drugs.</p>
<p>I hope he gets out if there and gets real help, not what he's getting. That's awful.</p>

        <p>All I can say right now is: I'm not trying to blame you but you have put yourself in a dark place in life. I just hope this gets through to you. You can believe what you want to believe but please just talk to someone I would say your mom but its pretty clear she wouldn't be good for you right now. I recommend a psychiatrist. I have seen so many people in the same situation as before, saying these things in your head that makes you forget that the people around you are human. I have seen people become so much happier than they were before. and just please get professional help. Please don't block this advice out. You don't have to fully block out your beliefs but just try not to think about it while you make yourself better. I'm not responding to this comment in particular because I know its not entirely true if at all, not because i'm a "sheep" but because of the way you described it and worded it. So just please don't dig this hole for yourself. Also this guy in the OP killed a young man while driving intoxicated.</p>

        <p>Wow, you are a piece of work.  Get out of here.  I wasn't talking about that guy.  I don't know a thing about him. I clicked to see what the story was.  I was talking to the person who has a loved one in a psych ward. It's a terrible thing to go through. You go get help.  Better yet, why don't you check into one and find out how bad it really is.  It's all quackery.  The people there deserve better.  While they may have real problems, they're not getting the help they actually need in many cases. </p>
<p>My friend who was in the psych ward, all she needed was thyroid hormone replacement.  But the permanent effects of the drugs they put her on messed her up.  She was never the same.  Eventually she graduated college, but it was a struggle afterwards, when previously she had a 3.9 out of 4.0 for her first 3 years. You don't know what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>He was 20 years old and it was more than a decade ago. It doesn’t make it OK but people grow and change a lot in 10+ years, and it’s convenient how everyone who brings it up leave out that fact. He did something horrible when he was 20, it doesn’t change the truth of what he’s saying now.</p>

        <p>As far as far I know, he isn't, but his sister is, and I suspect he could have it and be undiagnosed. He already has three diagnoses: depression and anxiety (diagnosed in his teens), and PTSD (diagnosed during his first week there).</p>

        <p>Ian Smith is proof that when times get impossibly weird and awful, even the worst  people can be allies. The man is unrepentant about a death he caused, and has not seen fit to really change his behavior. He's a bully and generally an unpleasant shithead according to people who knew him.</p>
<p>But his long history of lawless behavior means that when we need someone to stand up to Murphy's Law, he's been there. If I could drive, I'd visit Atilis Gym and get a membership. For the first time in my life, I'd have a gym membership, just because I consider him an ally in this fight. When the fight ends - win or lose - I will go back to using him as an example of a need for stricter alcohol laws and vehicle regulations. But for now, I need him to be right where he is and doing exactly what he's doing.</p>

        <p>Why do you say he's unrepentant? He spoke about it on Instagram and sounded very regretful about it, said he takes full responsibility for it, and doesn't blame people if they hate him for it. </p>
<p>He said he woke up after a night of drinking in his dorm room and got in his car.</p>
<p>"Moments later, I was the sole cause of a motor vehicle accident that took the life of a young man named Kevin. When I awoke that morning, I didn't realize there was still alcohol in my system. Being a 20-year-old kid, nobody ever explained those dangers. It was always don't drink and drive, and we didn't drink and drive. I made a point not to."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter because the end result was still the same. My actions caused the death of a young man and broke the hearts of an entire community, and that's something that they'll never fully ever recover from. There's nothing that I can do other than try to live a good life and give back and try to promote as much love and positivity in the world as I can."</p>
<p>"That being said, what we have started here and what we are doing at Atilis has very little to do with me as an individual. I just happen to be at the front of it. What we're standing up for is far greater than me and far greater than Atilis Gym."</p>

        <p>Jesus, now that is eye opening, never knew that. I only met the guy once, and essentially sat next to him in a nearby booth for 20 minutes. But thank you for letting me know, guess he’s a piece of shit after all.</p>
<p>Edit: After reading the comments below me. Maybe not so much a piece of shit if he plead guilty like that to a charge like that. Everyone does stupid shit when they’re young, but taking a human life is a big event, accident or not. But the man at least served his time.</p>

Maybe he’s still an awful person and nothing will make what he did excusable, but a lot can change in 13 years.

        <p>When one is to step outside, into the cruel, unforgiving, dangerous world, they assume a certain level of risk. There are innumerable ways in which one can meet their demise. When you get into your car you are exposing yourself to a certain level of risk. Life is risky. If people are that goddamn worried then they should STAY THE FUCK HOME. He's trying to make a living, pay his bills, and feed his family. If someone is fine with having the individual responsibility to assume a certain level of risk and decides they want to patronize a gym, that's their decision. Stop trying to be fucking noble by supporting authoritarian government telling us what we can and can't do, and which businesses can and can't open. Your tyranny sympathizing is not virtuous.</p>

<p>What if I told you it doesn't matter how you slice it, a ton more people died this year than last. And it still is more than the number that died from car accidents even if you exclude everyone over 65. </p>
<p>&rt;Where is the flu, what happened to it this last year?</p>
<p>It still happened. And as noted, it doesn't matter because significantly more people died this year than the previous and the previously expect trend. </p>

        <p>2.8 million in 2020, vs 2.7 million in 2019. That's not a significant increase when you look at the numbers: 16,000 (roughly) more in 2020 than the previous year, whereas 2018 vs 2019 saw an increase in 20,000 (rounded). The death rate has consistently increased on average of 1.2% since 2014, with no significant upward deviation between 2019 and 2020 (<a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">source</a>).</p>
<p>I hate to burst your bubble, but you're wrong. You can sit down now, we're done here.</p>

        <p>Working out at home is very difficult for many people. You could lack equipment or space. You can be distracted and interrupted by children or other family. You could have neighbors living below you which would pretty much eliminate any kind of dynamic exercises. Home workouts do have diminishing returns. If you have been going to a gym for years and are fairly "ripped" or "swole", a home workout will just not get you the same results. </p>
<p>Most regular gym goers are simply not at risk from a disease that primarily effects the elderly and obese. Hitting the gym actually does more to prevent COVID from impacting them than staying at home ever would. And they are all making the choice for themselves to take the risk of going to the gym. Of course, we could start playing 6 degrees from COVID infection where one of these guys MIGHT have COVID and MIGHT give it to another gym goer who MIGHT go see an elderly family member (who is making the choice to see them) who MIGHT get COVID from them and then MIGHT die. But I would think the benefits (Improved health and reduced risk from COVID) outweigh the risk that they might, might, might, might give someone COVID who eventually dies from it.</p>

        <p>I personally was disabled by a pharmaceutical called Ciprofloxacin in October. I let my guard down once and it cost me everything. Tendon and nerve damage now. I went in with one problem, was made 100x worse, and still have the original problem. However, there has been some improvement over the 6 months. It's expected most will make a full recovery from fluoroquinolone toxicity. And then I'm coming for Big Pharma. I will be outside that prescribing doctor's office. I will be outside the White House. I will do whatever it takes to get attention. I'll name names. And I will take a bullet before their vaccine. <strong>The answer will always be no, Joe. Do you hear me loud and clear? Fuck you.

        <p>im all about health, fitness and being swole af. brute force is always a good thing to have.</p>
<p>that being said...you guise have it all upside down.</p>
<p>probably because the concept of preventive measures is foreign to you.</p>
<p>you dont wear a helmet when you ride a bike because your head is in constant trauma. you wear a helmet in the off case you ran into an accident.</p>
<p>you dont wear safety goggle when using an angle grinder because you are a fag. you do it because of the off chance hot metal shavings get into your eyes.</p>
<p>you dont wear work boots at a construction site because it looks cool. you wear them because steel is harder than your toes.</p>
<p>the list goes on and on, and vaccines are a preventive measure as well.</p>
<p>being a contrarian for the sake of it does not make you cool guys.</p>

        <p>This is a sub for people that have done one too many tabs of acid and ate one too many mushrooms I literally can not 😭You being on this sub making a sub about a new normal about not wanting to follow the new normal is literally you following the new normal because you’re creating a whole entire thing about how you don’t like it.

<p>You see the wild thing here though is it has nothing to do with what Americans face today. And he has owned up and fixed his issues from his young life for his entire adult life. But as always it must be used to target a real movement that involves all Americans even though it’s totally irrelevant. People that band to this mans sin that he foolishly did in college as a 20 year old totally ignore Cuomo killing actual grandmas through the means of Covid which has a total relevance to what we are facing. It is what it is.</p>

        <p>Yeah, Cuomo has killed more people than this dude. But if you notice there is this weird double standard about killers, the more social support a killer has, the more killing is trivialized.</p>

        <p>I nowhere am advocating a killer. He made an extremely stupid decision at 20 years old like many college kids do except he resulted in a horrible incident, what I mean is a ton of stupid kids get lucky... I was one of them. If the man didn’t take blame and responsibility then we’d a have issue but he does take full blame and he’s lived his whole life reaping what he’s done. He even says it’s okay to hate him he understands and that anyone should hate him and have the complete right to. He did a horrible and stupid thing and should owe his life to that family, but I’m not gonna say he’s a killer like he intentionally killed someone. He was an 20 year old college idiot who made an extremely stupid decision. And he has to live the rest of his life knowing that he caused another young kid to die because of it. Now he’s trying to help people to the best of his capabilities and I would say he’s definitely helping the people of NJ in their current totalitarian orders. It will never fix what he did but the man wakes up every day knowing what he did. And he is trying. I can not say he’s a worthless soul for what he has moved. However, you are right though, we should never excuse death. And It must remain known.</p>

        <p>Wear a mask and don’t go near other people if possible while in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. I genuinely don’t understand how that’s such a hard concept for y’all to grasp. You guys were/are willing to spread a disease nobody’s immune to that can result in permanent damage or even death just so your daily lives aren’t mildly inconvenienced. It’s honestly wild how narrow minded and childishly stubborn some people can be.</p>

        <p>Everywhere I go, everyone wears a mask. My city had just as many cases a few months ago as anywhere else. Mask compliance is extremely high in most places. If anti-maskers are "the reason" the virus is spreading, the CIA needs to test us for fucking virus-spreading superpowers.</p>
<p>We've been doing this shit for a year and it should be obvious that it's not really doing anything. If lockdowns and mandates were the answer, Michigan wouldn't have rapidly climbing cases while Florida and Texas have decreasing cases. You wouldn't have to go "well Australia and New Zealand did it right" while ignoring Spain, Italy, France, Brazil, the UK, Canada, etc, and ignoring that Australia and New Zealand still have lockdowns.</p>
<p>These measures are taking a disaster and turning it into a catastrophe. Governments are shutting down businesses, causing people to lose everything they've worked for, keeping them isolated and depressed, preventing them from exercising, and creating inflation by printing money to solve the problem they caused. </p>
<p>And you act surprised that people are like "hey im fucking sick of this". It's not because everyone wants to go to Chili's, it's because they've lost a year of their lives and have nothing to show for it. The only thing keeping anyone going on this is the sunk-cost fallacy.</p>

<p>There is still education.</p>
<p>People can still do exercises.</p>
<p>People still have the same rights.</p>
<p>Also what is the problem with programming? It is the job that will give you normal life and will make a brighter future.</p>

        <p>The 'education' they provide is a pale imitation of even the crappy education that was provided before.</p>
<p>Some people can do bodyweight exercises if they live in a large enough home. However, again, it is still a pale imitation of a real workout.</p>
<p>People do not have the same rights. Peaceful assembly and free association are out the window. Earlier so was peaceful worship, although they have backed off since.</p>
<p>And 'programming' in this case means programming people. As in, brainwashing them into believing nonsense like "the government cares about you" or "Trust us. The experts know what is best."</p>

        <p>I'm not for lockdowns or masks, but you can do bodyweight exercises that get you in great shape in a room the size of a prison cell. Some books with programs include "Convict Conditioning," "ConBody," "Be Your Own Gym," and other power calisthenics programs. Ideally, you can do whatever workout you want in the facility of your choice or outdoors, but if you're limited to your home most of the day, you can still stay in great shape.</p>

        <p>First you don’t “know” op. Words matter and since you’re so intelligent you should understand this. Second my experience in life projection is a common trait. So when I see people saying things like “dumbest idiots” it’s safe to say they’re on the lower end on the intelligence spectrum</p>
