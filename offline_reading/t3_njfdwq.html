    <strong>The Growing Problem Of Scooby Doo, The Suspension of Disbelief, And Indignant Incredulity ..</strong>
    <p><p><strong>"I was amazed. It was sorta interesting as I couldn't believe I was reacting..."</strong></p>
<p>those were the words of someone who ate magic mushrooms. </p>
<p>just kidding. </p>
<p>Those are actually the words of someone who got a COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>this is what we call, being in a </p>
<p>"mental state of suspended disbelief" or "suspension of disbelief"</p>
<p>and also what we call, "incredulity"</p>
<hr>
<p>the rabbit hole is deep, but the time is well-invested. </p>

<hr>
<p>long story longer, </p>
<p>your mind must go into a state of "suspended disbelief" in order for you to enjoy a cartoon like Scooby-Doo. </p>
<p>your analytical, conscious, thinking, woke mind should be busy questioning the premise of a talking dog, on a TV screen...</p>
<p>and yet, you not only do not question the premise of a talking dog on TV, </p>
<p>you <em>actually believe</em> that you can <em>hear</em> this dog speaking coherently, </p>
<p>and that you personally can <em>understand</em> the talking dog...</p>
<p>and that you <em>know</em>, when the mask finally comes off, </p>
<p>then we will finally <em>see</em> who the masked villain <em>really</em> is. </p>
<p>while that is cute, and endearing, when it happens to a 4 year old... </p>
<p>its a event-horizon-size disaster when it happens to several generation of adults.</p>
<p>because this mental state of suspended disbelief does not just STOP when Scooby Doo is over...</p>
<p>it actually carries on for at least 24 hours...</p>
<p>therefore, if you watch Scooby Doo every day at the same time, </p>
<p>you will <em>always</em> live, every moment of your life, in a mental state of suspended disbelief. </p>
<p>So what happens is, for the other 22 hours in a day that you aren't binge-watching Scooby Doo, </p>
<p>Your brain is still in La-La-Land. </p>
<p>Discombobulated. </p>
<p>Disoriented. </p>
<p>Confused. </p>
<p>Warped. </p>
<p>Dizzy. </p>
<p>Puzzled. </p>
<p>Fragmented. </p>
<p>Shattered. </p>
<p>Unfocused. Blurry.</p>
<p>Buried, Under many, many layers, like and onion, like sedimentary rock </p>
<p>Its unhinged from reality. </p>
<p>You literally shouldn't even operate a car or heavy equipment, under the mental influence of Scooby Doo. </p>
<p>While you are in a state of suspended disbelief, you are very suggestible, and persuadable, </p>
<p>You are more likely to buy something you see advertised on TV.</p>
<p>You are more likely to believe a fake news story on CNN or FoxNews or InfoWars or ... reddit...</p>
<p>The only real solution to this problem, is to Cut The Cord. </p>
<p>. #Hashtag --&rt; #CutTheCord </p>
<p>http://twitter.com/hashtag/CutTheCord</p>
<p>Unplug the TV. </p>
<p>Cancel the cable TV package. </p>
<p>It actually takes a few months of NOT watching TV, for your brain to get out of Scooby-Doo mode, especially if you have been watching TV for many years. </p>
<hr>
<p>"Incredulity" is the mental state of "I just can't believe..." </p>
<p>And you know that someone is in this mental state, because they say things like </p>
<p>"I just can't believe..."</p>
<p>without realizing that the reason they "can't believe"... is because they are in a mental state of incredulity.</p>

<hr>
<p>and that while they say "I just can't believe..." can almost feel like a form of of humble-boasting...</p>
<p>it really should be taken as a WARNING. and ALARM. and ALERT. a SYMPTOM. </p>

        <p>I never understood why anybody watched TV once they got onto the internet. It takes many many years to shed the programming and it requires constant work. I was happy to get on with it. I still am. Most people have no interest in any mental work whatsoever. They are completely useless. All they can ever be is fuel pellets in the furnace of their owners.</p>

        <p>it was hard for me to cut the cord. i grew up being spoon-fed TV programming. your life revolved around the TV schedule. </p>
<p>i felt that if i didn't watch CNN each day, at least long enough for it to loop around, then i was missing something and not being informed of current events.</p>
<p>one day i literally took notes as i listened to the news. i jotted down names, facts, etc. and then i fact-checked what they were talking about. and from what i could gather, they not only "didn't get it right", they flat out lied about everything they said. everything. </p>
<p>now, if i go to http://CNN.com its like driving by a train wreck. </p>
<p>each headline is just obvious propaganda. </p>
<p>you read the headlines with a cynical view like, </p>
<p>"So what is CNN lying about today"</p>
<p>"What is CNN trying to distract us from today? whats <em>REALLY</em> going on in the news...*</p>

        <p>Nice rant, I guess... If you can't separate fact from fiction, maybe you shouldn't be allowed out without a 'minder' though. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm 'superman', but I can both watch Scooby-Doo AND know that real dogs can't talk. The show had (has?) one great redeeming quality- in the end, the monster is always a person that is trying to profit by scaring others. Just like real life! (Nooo... I couldn't mean Fauci &amp; the endless parade of corrupt politicians all dancing to the tune of billionaires.. That would be crazy, right?)</p>
