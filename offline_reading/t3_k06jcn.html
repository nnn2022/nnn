    <strong>Getting pushback against the idea that this shit is fascism? Here's why it is.</strong>
    <p><p>The disdain for even bringing up human rights from doomers right now reminded me of this essay and all the ways the war against covid fits neatly into the fascist model. I go back to this essay every few years or so to make sure I still agree. Whichever "side" is advocating authoritarianism at the moment will be completely unwilling to engage with your points. I last brought it up to some right leaning friends in 2014 who wouldn't even read it, but this time around it's the "left" leaning who won't engage. </p>
<p>I wrote this as a comment but decided it deserved it's own post. If you have anything to add to my list, I'd love to hear it.</p>
<p>https://secularhumanism.org/2003/03/fascism-anyone/</p>
<p>1) powerful and continuing nationalism - look how well China handled the disease, America sucks</p>
<p>2) disdain for human rights - muh freedumbs. This shit pisses me off to no end. Bonus video: https://youtu.be/SzJvjd7K5XU because you might need a laugh as bad as I do these days</p>
<p>3) identification of enemies as a unifying cause - I shouldn't have to explain this one. Having your dissent visible to others is quite possibly unique to this situation, and has been difficult to the point of pointlessness for me and countless others to navigate</p>
<p>5) rampant sexism - Karens don't wear masks, closure of schools and restaurants disproportionately affects low income women</p>
<p>6) controlled mass media - social media censorship and fact checking. Someone with an ironic username similar to killallfascists argued with me on another sub that fact checking isn't fascism, but if you buy into the idea that we all operate with internal biases, and even if you don't, it clearly depends on the fact checkers themselves and by whom they are employed</p>
<p>7) obsession with national security - national security and public health have become synonymous. This is why I opposed the calls for the national defense act to be used to manufacture masks. If it becomes appropriate for medical manufacturing to be funded through the Pentagon, the MIC wins forever. There will never again exist the absence of a new health threat on the horizon, just like how the war on terrorism is literally unwinnable</p>
<p>8) religion and government intertwined - government forced closures of churches, racist targeting of hasidic jews, also arguably the rise of following science as a religion</p>
<p>9) corporate power protected - Walmart and Amazon were always essential businesses. </p>
<p>10) labor power suppressed - tHeY jUsT wAnT hAiRcUts right guys. Plus Amazon's labor busting... I hope you don't order from there.</p>
<p>11) disdain for intellectuals and the arts - questioning authority is no longer welcome, museums and the arts are non essential. Want another laugh? https://youtu.be/7U598mxz5z4 this also applies to the previous point.</p>
<p>12) obsession with crime and punishment - can't believe these anti maskers and people partying, they deserve big fines </p>
<p>13) rampant cronyism and corruption - field hospitals were built with no bid contracts, Neil Ferguson caught with his mistress (plus Newsom, Pelosi, Feinstein, and the mayor of Philly being caught ignoring their own advice) after being responsible for the original incorrect modeling predicting millions of deaths</p>
<p>4) Supremacy of the military and 14) fraudulent elections <em>might</em> not currently apply, although my state is using the National Guard to administer post Thanksgiving rona tests and to "remind" travellers to quarantine, but 12/14 is good enough for government work</p>
<p>If you made it this far, danke for reading and engaging. Hope you can use this to bolster your own confidence in the righteousness of our cause, and get at least one sheep to think a little harder about what they are embracing so blindly. </p>
<p>Again, I'd love to read anything you have to add to the list, and if you have any relevant "subversive" videos to share I know I could use a laugh and a song.</p></p>

        <p>I always like it how in pictures and media no one can post an EKG that’s normal sinus rhythm.</p>
<p>That EKG seems to show an accelerated junctional rhythm with a possible (?) right bundle branch block.  But that’s difficult to determine since it being junctional it could be wide-complex....</p>
<p>Is it so hard to find a picture of a normal heart rhythm?!</p>

        <p>Excellent post.</p>
<p>Reality is a bitter pill to swallow.</p>
<p>All the people who are anti government yet want communism are probably living the dream right now. So many people stupidly believe that their governers actually give a shit about their welfare and safety.  They don'teven follow their own damn rules and restrictions. They're living their lives as normal while laughing at the peasants.</p>
<p>It's hilarious that so many people blindly trust politicians.</p>
<p>This year has shown that the lines between politics and science cam be blurred that the general population doesn't care.</p>

        <p>Its been pretty painful to realize exactly how easily led by the nose the general public is, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised critical thinking is even less common than it was in Germany in the 30s. Its also awful to think just how much online discourse is directed by literal children and then spread as gospel by unassuming adults. That part scares me like nothing else- a vast unpaid army of shills right under our feet. Crazy to think having more information makes us dumber on the whole.</p>
<p>Thanks for responding also, here and originally, funny that this post got far less attention than the comment that spawned it, but I clearly don't understand Reddit's algorithm well enough to make successful stand alone posts haha</p>
