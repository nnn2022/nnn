    <strong>Leading The Public Into Emergency Mode</strong>
    <p><p>The strategy of governments across the world to use " emergency " mode with the covid hoax seems to be the exact same strategy as the one that has been employed by climate change and eugenics groups... I feel that propaganda done by the deep state and the eugenics has definitely upgraded this year, with emotion and " emergency " being at the fore front of the propaganda.</p>
<p>This tactic has been used for a few years already in the climate sphere so not surprising the same one is used in the covid hoax with the slogans, we're all in this together, act now save lives, stay alert stay safe... They use these little catch phrases that emphasize the " emergency " at hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://myclimatechangehome.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/emergency-mode-2019.pdf">https://myclimatechangehome.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/emergency-mode-2019.pdf</a> </p>
<p>Here is a link to the author and creator of this strategy, what's troubling is she doesn't even try to hide the fact that it's manipulation... Salamon introduces “ the concept of emergency mode ”, which is how  individuals and groups function optimally during an existential or moral crisis, often achieving great feats through intensely focused motivation. </p>
<p>She writes: the goal of the climate movement must be to lead the public out of " normal " mode and into emergency mode. This has huge implications for the climate movement’s communication style, advocacy and strategy. Because emergency mode is contagious, the best strategy is for climate activists and organizations to go into emergency mode themselves, and communicate about the climate emergency, the need for emergency mobilization, and the fact that they are in emergency mode,as clearly and emphatically as possible. </p>
<p>The crux of the strategy document, Leading the Public into Emergency Mode: A New Strategy for the Climate Movement, is that citizens must first face, then accept that there is a life-threatening emergency in order to go into the necessary emergency mode. Once triggered, this enables the deployment of “ a huge amount of resources toward solving the crisis ” which would quickly become the clear, top priority for society. </p>
<p>I feel that going forward, every form of propaganda will have the emergency and doomsday approach, the end of the world is coming if we don't do x type of slogans...</p></p>

        <p>Although this is without a doubt a bad thing and has cost a lot of lives and ruined thousands or millions more... The silver lining is the skeptics among us are learning exactly how the tactics these creeps use work. Luckily, they aren't too complex and there really isn't much variation. </p>
<p>Should make an increasing number of us immune to this kind of propagandizing in the future.</p>
