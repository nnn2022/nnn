    <strong>How do we actually fight this?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in the U.K. and we just got locked down again a few days ago. I just want to know how exactly we’re expected to fight this. People say “just don’t comply” but that’s actually not even possible for a lot of us.</p>
<p>For example, I don’t have any friends or people I see regularly anyway so it’s not like I can just “keep seeing people”, I have no one to see. I know people who are doing that, and that’s great but I’ve always been isolated. I also don’t work because I’m recovering from PTSD. My normal activities consisted of therapy &amp; other healing sessions, sometimes going ice skating or to the cinema- obviously all of that is closed now. </p>
<p>The only thing I’ve been able to do is go for walks in nature, and that doesn’t feel like I’m “fighting” anything- that’s all I can realistically do since everything is shut. </p>
<p>My mental health has plummeted dramatically because of all this and I’m losing hope. I’ve been to a few protests but the organisation was terrible, turnout low and the police were always 10 steps ahead and dispersed the gatherings very quickly &amp; arrested as many people as possible.</p>
<p>I can’t believe it’s been almost a year of this. I just don’t know what to do</p></p>

        <p>I know how you feel. when all this shit started even all my family and friends were buying in to this shit all scared. all of my family asked each other not to come over, Wear your mask when you're out. All the same brainwashed shit. Then if anyone did show up they would get all mad saying, "you're putting my health at risk! don't you know how many people are dying!". like wtf? I have said it from day one and I will continue saying it. If the government cared about your health as individuals, Companies wouldn't be able to manufacture tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceuticals that are overly prescribed and abused, CARS, and so many more things that has a higher death rate than this Media fueled fear based division causing <em>~~"virus"~~</em>. Not to mention all of the people who have they claimed to have died from it that really died from pre-existing conditions, being isolated from their families and not getting the care they needed.</p>
<p>My grandfather had an aneurysm that ruptured a week before <em>covid</em> was even spoken about and blown out of proportion. my grandmother kept him on life support for two weeks before letting him go. When she got a copy of his death certificate do you know wtf it said!?</p>
<p>CAUSE OF DEATH: COVID-19......Fucking straight up lies and bullshit. My Mom was pissed!</p>

        <p>I hear you man, I don’t think you ever recover from ptsd, 22 years here and it doesn’t get any better. You have ok days and fucking awful weeks.  </p>
<p>Be careful where you spend your money and carry on as normal I would say. I’m fortunate my work keeps me going and they don’t give a fuck about the government line.</p>
<p>Attend any protest you can, keep your head and just grin at people scowling at you. Despite what the media says these protests are nearly every city every other week.</p>
<p>Head into town centres and film any police/covid marshal action you see. Harass  them when you see them harassing someone. </p>
<p>People are much more open to ideas in person than they are online, don’t take Reddit Facebook and Twitter as a cross section of society</p>

        <p>Become more self sufficient and wean yourself off the system. Start with growing some sprouts and herbs, then maybe make your own compost, learn to cook etc. Wean yourself off the matrix and it won't effect you much. </p>
<p>Self sufficiency leads to a lot of healing too.</p>

        <p>Read "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankel</p>
<p>I think it's really important to understand that the world is changing in a very positive way. I also think it's going to be difficult for people who haven't explored an expanded level of consciousness, which is to say, beginning to see that we are all connected and existing as a part of a unified consciousness.</p>
<p>There is this very 3d way of thinking, where we just look at the circumstances of the world. People who live only in 3D are the ones who are full of fear and confusion about the virus, they unwaveringly accept the media narrative because they don't have the capacity for layered and higher dimensional thinking. (in the simplest terms, acknowledging more than one perspective).</p>
<p>So, the fact is that you are in a good place. You are in a higher state of consciousness, and the more AWARE of that you become, the more it'll start to make sense. </p>
<p>This stuff won't last, it can't. The entire collective mentality is like a disease that has always been there and it's now come to the surface. We can't unsee it, and more and more people are waking up and seeing it every day.</p>
