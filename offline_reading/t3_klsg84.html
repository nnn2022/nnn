    <strong>A Christmas Observation</strong>
    <p><p>Did anyone experience relatives who kept away from family all year to "keep everyone safe" and then on Christmas they showed up because there were gifts/money for them (mainly money). They want to be virtuous this whole time until it doesn't benefit them. This solidifies the fact that with some it was never about protecting others.</p></p>

        <p>I just stayed at home with my kids this year. I couldnt be arsed with the faff on. </p>
<p>But my street was filled with cars from family members visiting. Theyre all elderly in my street. It was nice to see that they all had company. But I think its fucking ridiculous that it has taken all of this time for families to push past the fear to spend some quality time with them. Now they're going to be left alone again with fleeting visits at the door. So sad.</p>

        <p>Well I got my doomer family to come for Christmas by 1. Presenting the actual risks as I see it 2. Not doing it in an accusatory tone or talking down to them. Also making sure they knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be angry no matter what their decision was. </p>
<p>It was really nice that they thought about it and decided that seeing their family was worth the ‚Äúrisk.‚Äù We had a great Christmas. No masks. Awesome.</p>

        <p>I work with this fellow who always gets mad if someone took off their mask to drink something (unless if it was a really handsome guy) and is always parroting how cases are rising and how ‚Äúcompletely healthy people are dying!‚Äù.  But then I find out he hooked up with a stranger online.  Of course I asked him if he social distanced and had masks on during his hookup.  </p>
<p>He just told me it wasn‚Äôt my place to criticize him after I called him a hypocrite ‚Äî but of course he‚Äôs free to cast judgement and shame other people.  Now he won‚Äôt even look at me at work but honestly it‚Äôs nice to not hear the idiocy that comes out of that mouth.</p>
