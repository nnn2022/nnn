    <strong>Your take on the energy of people today. Has it changed?</strong>
    <p><p>This is not a thread to whine or complain, rather to discuss if you've seen a change in the behavior of people on a day to day basis. No, not the easy to point out stuff like exploding over seeing someone without a face mask but the less extreme examples. The subtle undertones of everyday interaction.  </p>
<p>Today I was turning to cross the street and saw this girl in a dress (Strange because it's like 35 degrees out) slowly walking across and being followed by some kid with a camera. It was clearly for a tiktok video. They had full right to cross but I was about to miss the light and she was doing this bizarre slow waltzing if it makes sense. Like this spinning up and down strut in slow motion as her friend filmed her. My guess is that it was Gen z because of how they looked. What would've taken 5 seconds to cross the street was turning into 30. Anyway, I said out the window "Come on..." and in response the entire friend group erupted "Reee shut the fuck up!!!!!!!".</p>

<p>Yeah, maybe I'm the asshole but it's the lack of self awareness that bugged me. The point is - Most people (Dependent on where you live or what prison state you're from) seem to have hair trigger responses now. If it's not full blown anger it's a very clear undercurrent of depression, anxiety, sadness, ect. This is not to say I don't experience these but when it's now a collective disorder, well - that makes you feel very alone. Even if you manage to make yourself feel better the rest of the world is still feeling down.</p></p>

        <p>Gen Z seems very artificial and self-obsessed. They attack older generations for being greedy, but I feel like every prior generation has been much more social and communal than Gen Z.</p>

        <p>Some people think that they are the owners of this planet. And social media and all those fake Internet points have enhanced this sense of entitlement. They think they are the only people in this world and have no respect for other human beings. I'm gen z and I despise my generation. I wish I was born earlier.</p>
<p>Although I was grown up and taught to respect older people/elders as they have so much more life experience and knowledge than you. And when a 60 year old something is about to tell me their life story I want to shut up and listen all about it.</p>
