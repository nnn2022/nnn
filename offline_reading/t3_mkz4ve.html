        <p>It's one thing to say "let's not fat shame" it's totally another to pretend it's healthy to be way obese. What is with these narritaves? Stay home, don't breathe, get fat, eat donughts, and get unnecessary shots.</p>

        <p>Fat shaming isn’t all bad. People making fun of me for being a thin kid is what made me what to be traditionally masculine. Obviously there’s a line and  a very thin one</p>

        <p>We’ve gotten to a point where fat acceptance is no longer good enough. Instead we have to be fat affirming or even fat glorifying. It strikes me that many of the people who espouse this ideology must be deeply unhappy with themselves.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with expecting respect from others. Demanding for people to be attracted to you or want to look like you is too far.</p>

        <p>Exactly! I have zero issue with people being overweight, could care less, I’m not a POS. But you want me to glorify obesity, yet also shame me for being critical of a virus? It’s insanity. This article was simply shared to show the major hypocrisy in our country, media, and citizens.</p>

        <p>Maybe I’m being a total dick but it’s not hard to simply <em>not</em> be obese. I’ve heard the “muh thyroid” or “no matter what I exercise and eat healthy and I’m still not losing weight” what people don’t understand is a thyroid problem is rarely the case for someone to be fat, and most of the time people may exercise but it consists of elliptical for half an hour and then they binge eat “healthy” food like granola, tons of nuts, peanut butter etc. how do I know? I’ve been there and done that. </p>
<p>Sorry to rant but getting lean is hard, it takes work and commitment. Most likely you are overestimating your workout calories burned and way underestimating the calories you are eating. CICO it’s that simple. Just last week I was trying to help a co worker into losing some weight, he’s like 5’7 or 5’8 and 220 lbs, claims he has muscle under the fat, says he doesn’t need to lift weights, we walk a lot at work so I told him to have a step counter as it’s some sort of progress and goal you can visualize, I also mentioned the hotel has a small gym with some dumbbells that go up to 50 (not much but it’s much better than nothing) next I got him eating around 2000 calories and to see how it goes the next couple days. I told him not to crash diet, as I’ve tried diets where I eat 1200 calories a day but it eventually lead to a binge that I couldn’t stop for days. What does this guy do? Eats 800 calories during a 12 hour shift and says he feels great... no shit you have been dieting for 12 hours, you aren’t going to shrink into nothingness after a day of not eating much, that night at the hotel he binge eats hotdogs and sandwiches from midnight til 2am. I found this out from a coworker who was rooming with him. </p>
<p>Next day he doesn’t say anything about the binging and sees what I buy at the store for the day (we work out of town so it is kinda hard) I buy things like protein bars or jerky and a v8, he gets jerky, but also chips, cheezeits, “health bars” etc. we get to work and at the end of the shift he tells me he’s only at 1,000 calories, I overlook his foods. He claimed he only ate 70 calories of jerky, not understanding what a serving size is, he overate on chips and cheese crackers because who only eats the serving size on those things? He then gets scared and tries to starve himself the next day. 
   The following day he eats nothing and I tell him to eat something and just be consistent, what does he do? “Nah man I haven’t eaten anything all day and I have all this energy, I feel great” by noon this guy went and bought two bacon cheeseburgers loaded with Mayo/ranch and ketchup w/ chips, later that night my coworker told me he ate a ton of Takis and cheezeits. </p>
<p>The next day he again acts as if he is on the diet, buys some diet soda, and proceeds to eat a payday, he says “this is the best candy bar ever and only 150 calories” I look at it and tell him it’s 3 servings per bar and the poor sap looks discombobulated “what you aren’t supposed to just eat the whole thing” again, reading a label is important. Later that day he eats 3/4 box of cheeseits and purple takis. He took my advice on the diet soda’s but failed to understand what I meant by drinking calories is bad and continues to drink three 200 calorie fruit juice drinks loaded with sugar. </p>
<p>For the next several days the cycle continues and he gets White Castle, hot dogs, etc because he’s attempting to crash diet after a lifetime of poor eating habits. </p>
<p>The following  week I see him drinking regular 270 cal Mountain Dew and jokingly say “is that diet?” He tells me he’s done with the whole diet thing and that he feels like he’s lost some weight, he says he isn’t going to do it because he’s going back home soon and is going to be eating some sort of highly caloric dense casserole and somehow figures drinking a ton of sugar filled drinks and caloric dense foods now is going to be ok since he’ll be eating like that when he gets home. </p>
<p>And that is what your average American’s thought process is, like I’ve said it’s hard and I used to be overweight. Growing up I was always fat, my family would tell me otherwise but nope, I was for sure an overweight child. Getting into shape is hard and requires work and persistency which is why your average peer is going to be a fat slob and want to act like it isn’t their fault, it’s hard to be in shape but it isn’t that hard to <em>not</em> be obese.</p>

        <p>Dude you are not kidding one bit on any of this. There is no crazy science or formula. It’s strictly CICO. I struggled with weight loss for years, and on MLK day this year I bought a food scale, stuck to a holistic natural diet (outside grocery aisles only), measuring EVERY crumb that goes into my body. Insane? Sure. Guess what? 40 pounds have MELTED off me since starting this mid-January. I’m 5 pounds away from my goal weight in almost 3 months. I’ve also developed an eating style for life. </p>
<p>People are blown away and keep asking what I’m doing? I tell them it’s very simple: commitment. People think you have to eat fat bombs, Whole30 shakes, protein bars every 16.34 hours with Ostrich blood extract, blah, blah. Nah, CICO and some cardio. </p>
<p>I think what boils down to is that people don’t want to do it. I used to use the excuse of, “it takes too much time to cook every night.” I have found it took me longer to drive to the Pizza Hut, stand in line, pick up my shitty food, and drive home than it does to cook a chicken breast. </p>
<p>Your co-worker doesn’t want it bad enough. I didn’t want it bad enough at the time. People don’t want it bad enough. And this fat acceptance shit is just going to worsen all that. </p>
<p>“Eat to live, not live to eat.” And let me tell you man, I was living to eat up until this year. Take out every night, big fancy dinners on the weekend, desserts after every meal, and the soda was flowing like water!</p>

        <p>Dude nice to hear, that’s some good progress. </p>
<p>After countless diets (including ketosis) I’ve found that eating around maintenance and then doing some exercise works best for me, I lose weight much slower but it’s easier to stick with and healthier.</p>
