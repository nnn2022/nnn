    <strong>I've been banned from covidiots</strong>
    <p><p>And literally, my real agenda is for discussion and middle-ground info sharing. I'm more against the divisive nature of the pandemic-lockdown, than wanting to affiliate myself with one team or the other</p>
<p>But I guess if I don't prescribe to the fear, then I'm an enemy</p>
<p>Makes me feel like I've been banned from their hive mind, like they're mentally in ICU and an unauthorized perspective is like a deadly disease. Also, makes me wonder how many people are afraid of non-governmental mandates, and this pandemic simply exposed how inherently fearful many people are. I don't have anything against them (lol, never wanted to be part of an us v them debate), and probably should just be grateful that I'm not as mentally sensitive to various perspectives on a certain topic. </p>
<p>Another analogy is like I've offended their religious scripture. I also wonder (just an interesting phenomena, despite the irritation) if flat-earthers ban people who say the earth is spherical or square</p></p>

        <p>I like to view both groups just to get a gist of animosity between the two view points.  They want you dead for not vaccinating, you want them dead for vaccinating.  I will say Covidiots seem a little out of touch with reality though, they seem to think it’s the deadliest disease ever encountered and everyone should be either forcefully vaccinated and masked or locked out of society / killed.  I enjoy reading both viewpoints.</p>

        <p>Ya. The correlation between this and the reefer madness campaigns of the early 1900s becomes more apparent to me. I can only imagine how back then, a person says cannabis isn't that bad, the politicised media snaps back that the person is advocating drug use. In the same manner, smoking weed isn't meant to be recommended, but if it's made illegal then it just fosters illegal activities. I wouldn't be surprised if people who don't want the vaccine (which will likely be mandated on a routine basis) will find ways to circumnavigate the law</p>
