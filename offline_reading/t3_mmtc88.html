    <strong>Formulate your Vitamin-D argument properly or it'll be used against you</strong>
    <p><p>It is important to understand that most simplified statements about Vitamin D being helpful against Covid are indeed wrong, and as such flawed arguments will be used against anyone who speaks out.</p>
<p>Instead, it is better to say something irrevocably true, like "Vitamin D deficiency is one of the biggest risks of getting severe version of Covid" and then continue "Ensuring not being vitamin D deficient is the easiest and single most important step one can take to ensure one's safety"</p>
<p>And then proceed to explain vitamin D is cheap, and there is no harm eating it even if one does get lot of sunlight and eats healthy, even if one does not have vitamin D deficiency.</p>
<p>International recommendations tend to be insufficient, since they are world average. For right dose consider latitude or available sunlight, time spent inside and outside, diet, etc. I personally believe 50 µg / 2000 IU daily is a good rule of thumb and starting point, but many say it should be even more. I take 80 µg and have my levels measured and they are within acceptable range. Not even on the high end of the range.</p>
<p>And in conclusion it's true: Technically vitamin D doesn't help fight covid, but it helps preventing vitamin D deficiency, which in turn is massive risk factor. But if you have good levels already, eating more ain't going to do anything extra. Thing just is, most modern people have way too low levels. Specially in the wintertime, or institutionalized people, or people of color who's melanin blocks the little sunlight they receive.</p>
<p>Vit D deficiency definitely isn't the whole story, but it is one big factor, and one of the easiest to fix.</p></p>

        <p>Technically it’s not even a vitamin it’s a hormone. You can’t supplement the sun, but if you try to at least take k2 to prevent calcification.  There definitely can be harms from too much synthetic d3.</p>

        <p>The harms are NOT from too much synthetic D3; the harms are from too little K2.</p>
<p>3mg Boron/day is also shown to help D, K2, calcium, and magnesium work better together.</p>

        <p>You don't even need a doctor to test for a Vitamin D deficiency. There are places online where you can order your own test and then go to an actual lab and have the blood drawn. Withing a few days, you have your test results. </p>
<p>My husband works outside in South Texas all day and even his vitamin levels were lower then what is considered a good level. He now takes 3000 UI 5 days a week along with vitamin K2. </p>
<p>I stopped taking my Vit D for a few weeks and started feeling like crap. Started back up this week and am already feeling so much better.</p>

        <p>Back it up even further... Vit D helps your body heal from  and prevent the symptoms of cold and flu, which we can't catch.  These symptoms are just our body naturally detoxing, which will happen seasonally, or when our systems are overburdened.</p>

        <p>i’m totally with you guys in despising the new normal and being full of hearty skepticism for the hugely overstepping lockdowns and slide into authoritarianism - but if vit d is a helper, why do sunny places like LA still have league leading “numbers?” - is LA’s “surge” largely explained by mass testing with the highly suspect overcranked PCR tests?  </p>
<p>I’ve been living in northern cities and I totally get the vit D deficiency argument here, but LA and other southern areas seem wonderfully sunny.  </p>
<p>maybe this comes back large % of the deaths being in nursing homes and among the already sick and dying in hospitals.</p>

        <p>Majority of the numbers are from institutionalized people.</p>
<p>Also very strong correlation with time of the year.</p>
<p>Still, as you say, places like Brazil makes one wonder what else are the factors.</p>

        <p>Totally not on the topic of vitamin D but I take this medicinal mushroom called Chaga every time I feel a cold or flu coming on and it stops it in it’s tracks. Pretty solid supplement to have on hand.</p>
