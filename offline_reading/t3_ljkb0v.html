    <strong>Masks are mandatory, so that corporations and industries make more money.</strong>
    <p><p>In my country they banned self made masks from cloth. You can still buy masks from cloth in the stores and some pharmacies. It's very clear that masks are mandatory (no matter if it's proven that they barely keep safe the person wearing it and the others around him) so that someone can make good profit.</p>
<p>Masks are now the new plastic straws. Seeing them thrown on the street, videos and pictures how masks polluted the beaches, seas and ocean, made me realise that the profit came with a cost - and that is nature.</p>
<p>This opens an opportunity for the 'Great Reset' (which is an organisation that will bring communism and socialism around the world - you will have nothing and you will be happy about it!) to push their dragonian propaganda ''in the name of earth'', and why because of the pollution (that woudn't exist if masks weren't mandatory) we need to create an one global government and why everything you buy, must become a service - meaning that instead of buying, you will be renting it for some time.</p>
<p>In my opinion masks are not so much about control (because there are coming vaccine passports and other thing you can't do without vaccination), but the controling class to see, if people will do anything they say. I have no problem with wearing a mask, but two? Taking a rushed vaccine with so many side effects? No, that's not for me.</p></p>
