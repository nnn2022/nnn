    <strong>Agency Tells Employees to Wear Face Masks on Zoom Calls Even If They're at Home</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; An agency has become a public laughing stock after enforcing a ridiculous rule on its remote-working employees. It has recently come to light that a Wisconsin government agency has enforced this rule upon their members of staff... <em>While they work from home.</em>   Like thousands of other businesses, the Department of Natural Resources in Wisconsin has had to adopt remote working during the pandemic.  Well, being in separate households apparently isn't safe enough because, now, the agency are taking their safety measures to a whole new level.  The new rule was emailed to staff members on July 31st. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; The natural resources secretary, Preston Cole, wrote: "Also, wear your mask, even if you are home, to participate in a virtual meeting that involves being seen - such as on Zoom or another video-conferencing platform - by non-DNR staff."  Staff members are now required to wear their protective face masks, while in their own homes. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Wisconsin governor, Tony Evers, signed an emergency order on July 30th making masks compulsory in indoor spaces. But the rule only applies when "the individual is indoors or in an enclosed space, other than at a private residence."  Nasia Safdar, an infection control expert at the University of Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8624033/Wisconsin-government-agency-orders-employees-wear-masks-Zoom-calls-HOME.html?ito=social-facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3qVzyf5B9q2a18ebaJjub8LiDhDWBaviVrsrQzfGXAO7AUNzBtWsFCz0s">said</a> that masks at home "were only necessary for very limited circumstances." These might include another person in the household having coronavirus.  But, other than that, there is no reason to wear a mask at home, she confirmed. "In other cases, there is no reason to wear a mask at home," Safdar explained. However, the Department of Natural Resources has other ideas... and their reasoning is nothing short of ridiculous. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;On their bizarre rule, they explained in the email,  "Set the safety example which shows you as a DNR public service employee who cares about the safety and health of others."  <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So they're only enforcing the rule to put on the front that the company "cares about the safety and health of others."  GOP state lawmaker, Joe Sanfelippo, has ridiculed the decision: "I'm more inclined to support things that actually do help as opposed to just putting on an appearance of helping," he said. </p>

        <p>Yes, and it still goes on. In fact, DNR went on to defend their position even after receiving a lot of flak for it. It's obvious virtue signaling, nothing more:  </p>
<p><strong>In an email sent July 31, Cole reportedly wrote:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<em>Also, wear your mask, even if you are home, to participate in a virtual meeting that involves being seen — such as on Zoom or another video-conferencing platform — by non-DNR staff.

<p>&rt; A spokesperson for the company said they wanted to create ‘a very visual reminder to all that wearing a mask in a public setting helps prevent the spread of COVID-19.’</p>

        <p>So I’ve had to do zoom calls where the people on the other end had masks on and it was literally soul destroying. Video calls are already a terribly inadequate replacement for human interaction adding masks just makes it exponentially worse. I fucking hate this.</p>
