    <strong>At this point the ball is in you court, small businesses!</strong>
    <p><p>We have rolling lockdown rules where I am it‘s having a huge impact on small businesses. Recently there was a new rule that gyms can open but with a max of 10 people inside at once (regardless of gym size) AND you have to wear a mask (goes against WHO’s guidelines). My gym goes on the news and complains about how these rules are destructive but then follows them exactly and posts shit like “stay safe!” And “Do your part!”. </p>
<p>Well you know what, I’m sorry but if your just going to bend over and take it from the government whenever they demand than I can‘t be expected to stand up for you anymore in protests and shit like that. We citizens can only do so much, at a certain point these business owners have to band together and stand up for themselves. They need to stop obeying these destructive laws or else they’re going to go out of business and I will have little sympathy For them if they were supporting these government decisions. </p>
<p>Just have to let some steam out because it’s really annoying when you put your reputation on the line to help these people only for them to betray you and take the path of least resistance.</p></p>
