        <p>The problem with these is that
 1) someone died, possibly from an experimental medical intervention
2) the timing from vax to death is highly suggestive that the vax was in play
3) statements are always made during the investigatory phase of cause of death. This lends to deflecting thought away from the vax 
4) The public receives next to nil follow up after the cause has been evaluated.</p>

        <p>What's the issue with this story?  No explanation given WHY he took the vaccine.  Was he required by his school? His employer? Did he do it of his own free will?</p>
<p>Some schools in US will require students to be vaccinated prior to starting school this fall.  This will be yet another fiasco.</p>

        <p>\&rt;   that a preliminary autopsy report indicated his cause of death might have been a heart or breathing issue, not a blood clot.  </p>
<p>Does he looks like a stroke candindate? I'm seriously wondering how do they get the Dr.s to lie like that and defend the vaccine at all costs. Do they pay them ,or how does that works?</p>

        <p>Throughout the history of vaccination, the criminal Big Pharma/Rockefeller Syndicate has always run coverups and interference.</p>
<p>“From London comes an alarming observation from a practitioner of excellent reputation and long experience. <strong>Dr. Herbert Snow, senior surgeon at the Cancer Hospital of London, voiced his concern, "In recent years many men and women in the prime of life have dropped dead suddenly, often after attending a feast or a banquet. I am convinced that some eighty per cent of these deaths are caused by the inoculation or vaccination they have undergone. They are well known to cause grave and permanent disease to the heart. The coroner always hushes it up as 'natural causes.' "</strong></p>
<p>You cannot find any such warning in any medical textbook or popular book on health. In fact, this writer was able to locate it in a small volume buried deep in the stacks of the Library of Congress. Yet such an ominous observation from an established medical practitioner should be as widely circulated as possible, if only to be attached by those who can refute its premise. At least it cannot be attacked by the Establishment as quackery, because Dr. Snow is not attempting to sell some substitute for vaccination, but merely warning of its dangers.”</p>

        <p>Sure ,just like with that 28 yr old girl who died just after the vaccination, but of course what caused it was a pre-existing condition right? Sure it gotta be a heart attack or whatever else, just not the vaccine. Oddly enough that when someone has underlying conditions and then die with covid the main cause of death is always the covid. Doesn't matters that the person had full blown AIDS, wrecked immune system ,were morbildy obese , older than 80... ,no one questioned the cause then.</p>
