    <strong>The numbers against "vaccine passports" and this push to have everyone vaccinated (tl;dr at bottom)</strong>
    <p><p>There are many people who argue that it's critical that nearly everyone that <em>can</em> get a COVID vaccine do so, even to the extent that it should become a requirement to be vaccinated to enjoy life by way of "vaccine passports."</p>
<p>The main argument for why it shouldn't be a choice, and frankly the only one remotely compelling, is that some people <em>can't</em> get a COVID vaccine for one reason or another and so people that choose not to be vaccinated are putting those that can't be vaccinated at undue, unethical risk.</p>
<p>While it's the most compelling argument, I still always felt it falls short of justifying the significant, unprecedented assault on liberty and privacy that the "vaccine passports" would pose. But earlier I finally asked the most important question: <strong>just how many people actually</strong> <strong><em>can't</em></strong> <strong>get the vaccine?</strong></p>
<p>It's surprisingly difficult to find out how many people are actually severely allergic to vaccines. The CDC recommends the COVID vaccine to virtually everyone over the age of 16 except, potentially, those that have had allergic reactions to vaccines in the past. <a href="https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/news/20151015/vaccines-rarely-cause-life-threatening-allergic-reactions-cdc">According to the CDC</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;Just 33 people had a serious, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction -- also known as anaphylaxis -- out of 25 million vaccines given, according to research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. <strong>That's 1.3 people in every million who gets a vaccine.</strong></p>
<p>That's pretty shockingly low number of people that have severe reactions to vaccines. I decided to look elsewhere and found that according to the <a href="https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/topics/smallpox/questions/en/">WHO regarding smallpox vaccines</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;Rarely, people have had very bad reactions to the vaccine. In the past, <strong>between 14 and 52 people per 1 million vaccinated experienced potentially life-threatening reactions,</strong> including eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia (or vaccinia necrosum), or postvaccinal encephalitis. Based on past experience, <strong>it is estimated that between 1 and 2 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated may die as a result of life-threatening reactions to the vaccine.</strong></p>
<p>Still surprisingly low, so I decided to look again and found that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/02/03/health/the-unvaccinated/index.html">according to CNN (stop laughing)</a> in California in 2013 there were 1,000 medical exemptions against vaccination among their slightly more than 6,000,000 public school students. This is 1 in 6,000. Far more than 1 out of a million but still suspiciously low.</p>
<p>But it is clearly exceptionally rare for a person to not be able to get a COVID vaccine <em>if they want one.</em></p>
<p>Even if we're very generous and say the actual number is 1 in 1,000, that would mean that about 330,000 people in the USA are unable to get a vaccine. However, being allergic to something in the vaccine doesn't necessarily mean you're at higher risk of serious illness/death from COVID than the other 99.9% of us. So if we're generous again and give those 330,000 a higher than normal fatality rate from COVID of, say, 1%, that means that worst case scenario here is there would be 3,300 deaths among folks who can't get vaccinated.</p>
<p>With a third of Americans not wanting the COVID vaccine, proponents of the "vaccine passport" want to coerce 110,000,000 Americans to get vaccinated, and probably repeatedly so, by withholding ability to enjoy life over the incredibly remote chance they come in contact with one of these 3,300 individuals that can't get vaccinated (and might die if they get COVID) <em>while infectious.</em> </p>
<p>The argument that we should coerce people to get vaccinated to protect those who can't get vaccinated isn't actually the only remotely compelling argument, it itself isn't even a remotely compelling argument. It's not about protecting the vulnerable or preventing hospitals from filling up.</p>
<p>It's about control. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> the argument that vaccine passports are reasonable to coerce everyone to get vaccinated in order to protect those who <em>can't</em> get vaccinated falls flat on its face because virtually everyone that wants a vaccine can get it.</p></p>

        <p>I wish the people who are at risk would take personal responsibility for their own safety health and we'll being and stop trying to push that responsibility onto the whole of society. Children ultimately bear the brunt of that responsibility with our ever expanding vaccine schedule. And with over two hundred vaccines in the development pipeline , that list is bound to continue to grow. At what point do we say , your health is your problem and not my kids problem</p>

        <p>But not everyone who wants to get a vaccine can such as immune compromised people or other rare cases where somebody isn't able to safely get it.</p>
<p>No one is forcing you to get a vaccine the same way no one is forcing you to go vacation in a country which requires you to get a vaccine on your passport</p>

        <p>It's not just about international travel. You are going to restrict people from going to schools, holding a job, or even going to the store. Anyone who doesn't choose to have the vaccine will not be allowed to participate in activities of normal every day life. </p>
<p>And this will just be the start. Soon the government will have the private sector doing all of its dirty work. The vaccine passports will turn into the "social credit scores" that liberals have been fantasizing about for years. They've been going ga-ga over it in China. A vaccine passport is the entry into that system.</p>
<p>Calling this all a "choice" is what some demented tyrant would say.</p>

        <p>Those stores have the choice to protect their workers from people like you who might be sick. Parents have the right to not send their kids to a school full of sick people. Jobs have the right to not hire an employee which night risk the safety of others.</p>
<p>It not about you. No one gives a fuck about you. It's about keeping other safe and if you don't want the vaccine than don't get one.</p>
<p>Trust me, your not important enough to where people dedicate their lives for vaccine research just to trick you.</p>

        <p>If someone is vaccinated then there is no reason anyone needs to keep them "safe" from those who choose not to get the vaccine. To suggest there is is a pretty anti-vaxxer thing to say. The vaccines are virtually 100% effective at preventing severe illness or death from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Anyone that wants to get the vaccine can do so. The number of people that can't get it for some medical reason is incredibly small.</p>
<p>If people want to take their chances with the virus, then let them. There's no compelling reason to not let them live a normal life, though. Stop being an anti-vaxxer.</p>

        <p>Ok. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">According to the CDC</a> there have been 277 COVID deaths among children 17 and under across the USA.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html">According to the CDC</a> only 1 in 4.3 infections were reported. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">With the US having just north of 33 million</a> confirmed infections, this means we can estimate the true infection count to be about 142,000,000 in the US.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html">Also according to the CDC</a> folks 0-17 make up about 23.25% of overall infections, which means there have been an estimated 33,000,000 infections among children.</p>
<p>277 deaths divided by 33,000,000 infections gives us an infection fatality rate of 0.000008, or 0.0008%, or a "survival" rate of 99.9992% among children in the USA.</p>
<p>This virus is not a threat to children.</p>

<p>If you are that worried about this virus, get the vaccine, wear your mask, you're protected! Your chances of getting the virus is slim. I mean that's what we are being told right? These vaccines are like 95% effective and no one ever goes to the hospital or gets seriously sick. So take your vaccine and mind your own business.</p>
