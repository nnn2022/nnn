    <strong>Don’t the case counts mean we have lots of covid survivors?</strong>
    <p><p>The government and media announces cases on the nightly news (I assume, because I don’t watch propaganda). We’re testing thousands of people and finding so-called positive cases.</p>
<p>What about these cases? They’re survivors right? </p>
<p><strong>Should they wear masks?</strong> They cannot spread the virus after a quarantine. </p>
<p><strong>They don’t need a vaccine.</strong> There are thousands of people who are naturally immune. How can a vaccine be mandatory for anyone who had it? </p>
<p><strong>They should be allowed to attend gatherings.</strong> They aren’t spreaders. Why should their lives be on hold?</p>
<p>The numbers they scare us with are real people who should be exempt from the nonsense. If you met someone who said, “I had (rhinovirus or influenza or measles or chicken pox) 3 months ago”, would you worry about catching it? I would not even think of that.</p></p>

        <p>As someone who tested positive, had hardly any symptoms and just finished quarantine I feel exactly as op does</p>
<p>If my positive test result was accurate and I beat Covid, why do I have to wear a mask? If I beat Covid doesn’t that mean I can no longer spread the disease?</p>
<p>Why do I need a vaccine? I have antibodies now and am naturally immune </p>
<p>I should be allowed to attend gatherings now as I’ve had it and can no longer spread it to anyone</p>

        <p>I've heard the anti bodies only last 3-4 months. Not sure if that is true. So everyone is pretty much always at risk, therefore the lockdowns MUST continue, according to the overlords.  It's all a big scam.</p>

        <p>So if natural immunity lasts only a few months, how can a brand new rushed vaccine have long lasting immunity? Are they going to have is all line up for an injection every few months? Like The Giver where society had to take their daily pill?</p>

        <p>That's exactly it. Misinformation, changing information based on new discoveries, outright lies that people just spew from their pieholes. There are stories that your organs are completely shredded and melted because of the virus.   </p>
<p>I know two people that got tested, came back negative, but their doctors said they definitely had it, regardless of the test. They said the anti bodies were already gone, but there's no way they didn't have the virus. What the hell kind of doctor is that?</p>

        <p>Your body will stop making antibodies if you aren't exposed for a long time. But realistically, you'll probably come in contact with the bug every so often and so your body will continue as long as this happens.</p>

        <p>That's another piece of stinking shameless bullshit. Antibodies last at least a few <em>years</em>...not months. But for some reason, all these "science experts" forgot everything they know about respiratory viruses back in March. Maybe they were all lobotomized. They still act like this is a mystical, magical, alien virus and are deliberately feeding the masses lies and quackery. They don't care about losing their credibility, because they know they will never be held accountable. Unfortunately, the public doesn't know anything about basic science, the masses are too stupid ad gullible and just believe everything the holy "experts" spew. So these "experts" don't care about putting a horrible stain on the name of science. "Look at us, we still don't know anything about this virus! We don't think it behaves like any other virus! Oh no, this is so unlike anything we've ever seen before.... let's flush all virology and epidemiology down the toilet! Oh look here's what we discovered, covid is dangerous to everyone and causes permanent damage to every part of the human body, and there's no lasting immunity, and everyone has it all the time, they have no symptoms, but they spread it like wildfire, and masks suddenly work for this virus...disregard the tons of studies that proved they don't work for other respiratory viruses, and this virus magically stops at six feet and BLM and Biden rallies magically ward it off too, and hey and let's pretend that we still don't know what the IFR is, because IFR is meaningless now!" Last year, they would have never said any of this bullshit they are saying...it would have been absurd. So why are they acting like clowns now and science has become such a joke?</p>

        <p>You can catch it twice and probably the 2nd time will be asymptomatic but you can spread it. At least that's my conclusion after reading reports of peopke who had it twice. 
Also some people had it worse the 2nd time but I think that's rare. </p>
<p>I also had it and I don't have antibodies anymore but a doctor explained me that we must have T-cell immunity, so I agree that we don't need a vaccine. 
Actually I'm worried about the side effects of a vaccine in a body that already had the virus, I didn't find any information about it.</p>

        <p>Here's the thing, if you join and read Covid groups, you'll find many people reporting re infections. Anecdotal, but there are many. But it's almost impossible to prove them as it requires a scientist interested enough in your case to sequence the virus of your first PCR vs second PCR. Also many people didn't have a test during the first wave. So we have only a few papers while there are thousands of anecdotal reports. </p>
<p>My guess is that catching it twice is rare but not as rare as we think, there are only a few papers because science goes slower than we like to think it goes. </p>
<p>Also I never read about asymptomatic spreaders being something rare, if you have the source I'm interested!</p>

        <p>That happened during the first wave between March/April because we didn't have mass testing. But now there are cases that tested positive in May for example and then got it again recently, so they have 2 different positive tests. Usually they asked the 2nd test because the symptoms came back. 
The only way to know if it's dead virus particles or a new strain is testing for it in a lab, which is expensive/rare. That's the main reason for the lack of reports about re infections. We just don't know how rare or not it is. 
As I read several reports my conclusion is that isn't rare neither something common. But re infections happen.</p>

        <p>This is just straight up disinformation, sorry. It is rare, and it is yet to happen in a person with a normal functioning immune system. Every reinfection has been due to a person having a nonexistent immune system or other medical issues that make immunity to any disease extremely difficult. A true case of reinfection gets headlines BECAUSE it’s so rare. And if a doctor can confirm a case of reinfection, they don’t just keep that info to themselves. Your “proof” is literally anecdotal stories from people in real life and the internet. That’s not exactly a reliable way of ascertaining the veracity of what you’re saying.</p>
<p>It’s very similar, in fact, to people who are obese saying that they eat very little and yet can’t ever lose weight. That is thermodynamically impossible, and generally these people are lying to themselves and to you by severely underestimating their food intake. If there was a true case of a person eating less and moving more and still bit able to lose any weight, that person would be a scientific novelty that would be asked to submit themselves to testing because that goes against our knowledge of how the body works.</p>

        <p>The problem is the PCR tests are overly sensitive and are wildly inaccurate. Estimated 40% to 90% false positives.</p>

        <p>Even the NYT has admitted that the tests are too sensitive: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html</a></p>
<p>(You might have to google it on your phone "Your Coronavirus Test Is Positive. Maybe It Shouldn’t Be" to avoid the paywall)</p>
<p>Furthermore, a PCR test is really designed to give a quantitative answer but they are using them to give binary positive/negative result which is very misleading. A person may have little more than viral debris that is non-infectious but due to the overly tuned tests they will show a positive test result which forces them to be quarantined.</p>
<p>Rational Grounds has a good article that explains PCR testing:</p>

        <p>They are testing more then ever before and its only logical that case number will go up more then ever before. The virus is highly contagious and no one is talking about how faulty the covid tests are were there are alot of false positives so it makes the numbers look higher then they really are. They dont talk about the death counts as much and how they are not spiking like the positive covid tests are. Remember this all started with two weeks to flatten the curve. This isnt going to end anytime soon unless people resist giving up more personal freedoms.</p>

        <p>Yes. It’s so ironic. More cases are scaring people. Guess what? Since deaths aren’t spiking like cases are, more cases shows the virus is <em>less</em> deadly as each day passes. Yet people are too brainwashed to realize that</p>

        <p>This has been bothering me too. So many people I know are obsessively following the case counts and lamenting how horribly the U.S. is doing because of it. They never mention that 99% of those millions of cases survive and most have probably long since recovered from it. Despite their obsessive focus on the numbers, somehow they still manage to believe that most people get hospitalized and die from it. I do not know how they manage to focus on the case and fatality counts for months and still not recognize that less than 1% die from it. It is mind-boggling.</p>

        <p>New cases are supposedly tested positive, say some of them are false positives, and some are mild, some people will still be hospitalised </p>
<p>The reason why people should care is the risk of too many cases overwhelming a country’s healthcare infrastructure</p>
<p>What proof exactly do we have that the infected stand no risk of reinfection? There have been (alleged) reinfection cases so it’s your words against others - how do we know who’s correct? </p>
<p>I’m assuming the following this sub believes:
That the virus isn’t that dangerous- the equivalent of the flu (that can also kill people)</p>

        <p>Nah mate I meant I’m following the assumption I see that the flu &amp; corona are similar in their danger to people. My belief is that both are dangerous, just that we have a much better understanding of the flu virus as we have encountered variations of the same type for years. While we have encountered the coronavirus for a long time, this one has been around for a year, so I wouldn’t rush to assume it’s harmless</p>

        <p>I survived with long lasting damage and guess what. The media is not that interested about it neither. 
They portray covid as a life or death situation and it isn't. A lot of people may need rehabilitation services after covid and the system doesn't have resources for us all.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm a survivor. I may have some immunity but I also can catch it again, re-infections are a thing. </p>
<p>Tho I agree that I'm scared of the vaccines as they are not being tested in people that already had the virus so only God knows how our bodies will react.</p>

        <p>Chest pain, cough, dizziness, blurry vision, tinnitus, numbness/tingles, brain fog, fatigue, tachycardia...? All is anxiety? My doctors don't think so. They all agree that covid fucked up my health and there's no treatment, just rest and pray it goes away. </p>
<p>I used to be extremely fit prior this virus. </p>
<p>Do you seriously think that ALL the long covid patients around the world are anxious? I mean, if you don't believe me, you can read the same story over and over again in different languages/countries.</p>

<p>Yes, they are all anxiety related, I know, I suffer from anxiety since 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The cough and the other may or may not be psychosomatic, there's also post-viral syndrome but that happens with many viruses to some people.</p>
<p>"My doctors don't think so".</p>
<p>Doctors are not all-knowing people and my experience with them is that they don't really care about you most of the time.</p>
<p>My advice to you: STOP READING PRESS ABOUT COVID, DON'T READ those awful forums of people talking about their "ruined lives because of covid", those forums are just a circle-jerk for hypocondriacs (I'd know) and other karma whores and they will only enhance your anxiety disorder and make you fell even worse.</p>

        <p>Lol dude, I tried going off from social media a lot of times, actually I'm going to stay off from social media again soon. It doesn't change my pain or my tingles, the lingering cough. I meditate daily, I have a what you'd describe as a happy life, just the virus fucked up my health. </p>
<p>I agree that doctors don't know shit because they have no explanation neither treatment for my symptoms. And let me tell you, I've been anxious in the past for other reasons, this shit isn't anxiety. 
I mean, what are the chances of 1000s of patients describing the same symptoms all over the world after covid? 
My guess is that this is a post-viral symptom (or the virus lingering like herpes) and yes, this happens with other viruses too. That doesn't make long covid less serious. 
As covid affected millions worldwide you'll have more patients suffering post-viral damage and syndromes, it requires research and treatments.</p>
<p>Well that's it, just my five scents. You can go read about us whenever you want, in different languages and social medias. It's up to you to believe if this is serious or "circle-jerk for hypocondriacs". 
I don't wish this to anyone but well, as the virus spreads like fire and nobody cares, we sadly will have more long covid patients coming along the way.</p>

        <p>Is not fear. Again. If you are scared of facts, that's your problem. I am not here to tell you to be scared, I'm here sharing my terrible experience because it's what happened. </p>
<p>The media only shares a few stories about long covid and if you go to the comments nobody gives a fuck. And the media isn't sharing the folks with long covid struggling to pay rent or going to work in pain. </p>
<p>It's like, if it doesn't happen to you... you don't care about it? Where is your empathy towards the people who suffer lung pain, hearth problems and so on after covid?</p>
