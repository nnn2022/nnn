        <p>I didn't like Trump. I didn't vote for trump. I hated listening to him speak during the early days of COVID. I was glad when his presidency was over.</p>
<p>This administration has caused me to change my political view. </p>
<p>Looking back on things, I think he got played and was in over his head. </p>
<p>I do think he had/has America's best interest in mind. </p>
<p>One of the things I disliked the most, was how he removed the US from our traditional allies. I also didn't like his position on globalization. </p>
<p>Looking at things now, our traditional allies are all fucking nut jobs turning into dictatorships. Tyrants. This administration too. </p>
<p>I went back and watched the Devos briefing about a week ago and see it completely differently now. Trump tried preventing what is currently happening right now, from happening. At Devos, he put Americans first, and refused there idea of "globalization". </p>
<p>So, while I didn't like Trump. If he runs again, I'll 100% vote for him. The world needs the US to have a leader. The WEF couldn't pull this shit off without the US supporting it. And that needs to end.</p>

        <p>Greatest controlled opposition operation in history. 2020 lockdowns and mandates never could have been accomplished under a dem, the right would never stand for it but with trump they all sat on their hands for a year as he let the lockdowns continue and rushed the clotshot at warp speed.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks trump is their friend is blind as to how corrupt the system actually is.</p>

        <p>I couldn't give a shit less about him or any other politician. If you still believe in politicians you're part of the problem.  </p>
<p>Edit: yes do downvote me, please. You who do are just as brainwashed as those sticking the needle in the arm, you're just of another opinion on certain topics, which is even worse.</p>

        <p>Downvote?  I can't see any votes on anything here... it's like votes are no longer doing anything.  I imagine people have to be voting up and down, but I see nothing.  So I just find it interesting that you can see votes.  Your comment and this whole post has no votes from what I can see.  Nor any other post.</p>
<p>So I'm upvoting your comment by making this comment, since the vote buttons seem to do nothing.</p>
<p>I realized what a sham politics was years ago.  Its just a bullshit control game - and I'm an adult.  I don't need a damn baby-sitter.  Both sides are the same.  You have a left wing and a right wing and they are both attached to the same bird.</p>
<p>Believing you need government or that one side is better than the other is indeed part of the problem.  We wouldn't be going thru this lock-down, scamdemic, terrorization without a government.  Basically, the only thing our government is doing these days is terrorizing us, controlling us, using us, killing us, and sucking us dry.</p>
<p>And I hate the 'voting for the lesser of 2 evils' crap.  Voting for the lesser evil is still voting for evil.  I refuse to vote for evil.</p>

        <p>Agree with everything you've said. I was downvoted to hell first, but then it turned around. It doesn't matter. I just want people to think clearly about this. Politicians have never been on our side and never will be. Stop supporting these bloodsucking psychopaths no matter their allegiance, it's not to you or any of us. God bless</p>

        <p>Possibly the best US President in my lifetime, but I don't intend that as high praise; it's just that all the rest have been absolutely awful.</p>
<p>He was right about HCQ, but then the media lied about it to discredit him. However, he totally fucked up on vaccines by giving big pharma immunity from liability, because he thought that'd get them out fast enough to save his presidency.</p>
<p>Biden is far wose in every way.</p>

        <p>Never voted for him. The absurd hate in mainstream media was overdone, paired with gaslighting to pretend Obama faced the same mainstream scrutiny. Ultimately Trump, good or bad, never wanted lockdowns but was coerced to appease the mid crowd for election appeal. Weâ€™re now living in a full authoritarian regime because itâ€™s human nature to believe if youâ€™re told one side is bad that the alternate choice is innately good.</p>

        <p>I'm not a big fan of Mr. "Take the guns now, worry about due process later". The only good thing that came from his presidency were those sweet sweet videos of "progressives" freaking out.</p>

        <p>I donâ€™t care for him but I also donâ€™t hate him. Mostly I just donâ€™t care about him at all. That being said I much would rather he still be President than Biden.</p>
<p>At least he was funny sometimes.</p>
