        <p>Fewer working adults with jobs, bills to pay and kids to feed frequent Instagram as much as the younger generation still living with mommy and daddy. But when mommy and daddy can't afford to pay for their free iPhone, internet access and groceries anymore - that opinion may change.</p>

        <p>It seems to me that most of the people who agree with enforced lockdowns and the government restrictions either fall into one of two categories:
A. Those of the elderly who spend a significant time watching the news
B. Those of the young who spend a significant time on social media</p>
<p>Those living in the real world seem less inclined to fall for the victim mentality of ‘daddy government only abuses me because he loves me!’</p>

        <p>Yeah and people seem to forget that a large segment of the population didn't even have the luxury of experiencing what it's like to cower at home because they've had to work this entire time; making and delivering goods to these valiant online virtue signallers who still make a comfortable living working from home while whining about about anti-lockdowners.</p>
<p>But who gives a shit about poor people, right? They deserve to be put "in harm's way" as long as people get their pizza and Amazon packages on time.</p>

<p>While the teachers cry about the incredible threat to their health by being forced to teach in person - who's crying for the grocery store clerks who haven't had a day off since this thing began and have been facing the public almost daily this entire time?</p>

        <p>Also, what about millions of people made redundant while these pro-locks were working from home, buying new furniture for their new home office? There's the lack of care and empathy for others. Some people lost everything while they were trying to decide from which restaurant to order dinner.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm actually pleased to see that we are at least 45% because that number will continue to grow as more people are beginning to see through it, just very gradually.  It feels like we are just 10 percent or something, but I'm in the UK and people have totally lost it here now.</p>

        <p>I believe there are more of us than it seems because we’re far more ‘silent’. Most people that disagree with lockdowns and/or think we’re heading somewhere bad and this is just the excuse don’t seem to want to talk about it openly. </p>
<p>There is fear everywhere. You’re either afraid of the virus, afraid of the government and the police, afraid of people judging you for wrong-think, or afraid of heading into authoritarianism while no-one does anything about it.</p>
<p>People are too scared to stand up for what they believe in when they’re constantly reminded they’re ‘wrong’ by the news, government, social media and neighbours. There are bound to be some of us who aren’t afraid, sure. But too far and in-between to actually be able to do anything significant about it.</p>
<p>I’ve spoken to a lot of people about it here in the UK. It seems like nearly a 50/50 split for me - people blaming the prolonged restrictions on the SeLfiSH PeOplE tHaT DoN’T StIcK To RuLES, or people that think this is essentially all a load of BS. When you go online, you’re seeing virtue signallers since that’s what most of us do online, without even realising it. I think if you talk to people outside more, you’d be surprised by how many people will agree with you.</p>
