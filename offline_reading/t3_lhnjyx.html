    <strong>Do your kids go to school for in person?</strong>
    <p><p>I knew this school year was a long shot to have somewhat of a normal year.  But its been on and off between virtual and hybrid.  Im hoping come next school year, we will have some improvement.  However I feel like they will still require the masks.  Even though teachers are becoming eligible to get the vaccine if theyd like.</p>
<p>I do not want to send my young kids to school 5 days a week wearing masks all day.  Home schooling could be tough but I really cant stand the fact of them wearing them all day.  How do you handle?</p></p>

        <p>AP Science Teacher here, and also one who believes COVID is a total farce. </p>
<p>We’ve been “open” since last October under a shortened day with and “A-B” schedule. Students who’s last name starts with A-H attend part of the week while the others attend for the rest of the week, with kids having the option to go virtual. </p>
<p>Let me tell you, keep your kids homeschooled. It’s a total cluster fuck trying to manage which kids are virtual and which aren’t. Kids fall off the face of the earth with no means of contact. Teachers cry in my face everyday about how hard their lives are while assigning kids over 2 hours of pointless homework each night “to make up for lost hours outside of the classroom.” </p>
<p>These kids are suffering from it. The seniors I teach don’t get a prom, or the opportunity to play sports. They’ll barely get a graduation if that’s even possible. I’ll be leaving at the end of the school year because personally I’m sick of dealing with the guilt of feeding kids the “mask up! Stay safe” propaganda. </p>
<p>I could write a novel about how much of a hell hole teaching has become. The job itself isn’t that hard, but the bullshit that comes with it makes it unbearable, even more so after COVID. You’d be better off teaching kids on your own anyways. </p>
<p>I know it’s a hard job, but if you saw  some of the bullshit these kids were being fed in public education you’d have pulled your kids out a looooong time ago.</p>

        <p>Do you have any plans for what you’ll do after?  I feel like this whole situation has brought education, especially public education, in the spotlight.  Students are suffering, teachers complaining about having to go teach in-person, parents pulling kids out of schools to place in private ones or even homeschooling them, etc.</p>
<p>It makes me sad to hear what you’re having to deal with along with your students as I can’t imagine dealing with that, but I’d be completely fed up too.</p>

        <p>As a teacher, I can tell you that some of the stuff teachers whine about is on the verge of being virtue signaling kind of like the whole thing with COVID and nurses being on the “frontlines” while somehow still being able to make Tik toks. </p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s an easy job by any means either if it’s done with the intent of helping students, but if I don’t have the support or means to help them my hands are tied. It also doesn’t help I have to work two other jobs part time to pay the bills, so to answer your question I’ll be doing full time work with one of my other jobs working with a conservation group.</p>

        <p>I’m not surprised about the virtue-signaling.  In my city, some teachers decided it’d be a smart idea to drive slowly up one of the 3 main roads honking the whole time to protest having to go back to schools before being vaccinated...as if that would do anything.</p>
<p>I’m shocked that you have to work two other jobs to pay the bills too.  I’m happy to hear of your plans to work with this conservation group though!  It seems really exciting and really fitting to your interests.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that. The virtue signaling is terrible. Teachers complain about how hard their job is now, but when you walk into their rooms they’re all just sitting on their phones or watching Netflix. </p>
<p>The best part is when you see them post on social media about how they have to “quarantine” to protect the students and staff for two weeks then turn around and go on vacation. That’s the part I think irks me more than anything.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your candor and for trying to be a good teacher, even though they made that impossible. I had some life-changing AP teachers in high school and I’m sad your students won’t get to have the same thing. But I get it, and I plan to homeschool.</p>

        <p>We've homeschooled since the beginning so Covid was a non issue in that regard. She's continued to meet in person every Friday with our homeschool group so she's still had time with her friends. A massive blessing to be honest. Search for Classical Conversations if homeschooling is still on the table.</p>

        <p>For us it is hybrid. Half the week at a learning center for $40/day and half in school. All of it requires masks. I told my kid he could stay home if he prefers, but he chose school. I told him if double masking becomes a thing that the offer to stay home is still on the table. He's too young to stay home that much and has ADD, but I would figure something out.</p>
