    <strong>Are we setting up Covid to become a human version of Marek's disease?</strong>
    <p><p>I went down a rather frightening little eddy today reading about the impact that vaccines have had on the evolution of Marek's disease in chickens.  Based on my reading of the wiki it seems like the "leaky vaccine" which reduces symptoms, but can't stop transmission (sound familiar?) has altered the natural evolutionary course of this common poultry virus. Here's the relevant section from the wiki:</p>
<p>&rt;Because vaccination does not prevent infection with the virus, Marek's is still transmissible from vaccinated flocks to other birds, including the wild bird population. The first Marek's disease vaccine was introduced in 1970. The disease would cause mild paralysis, with the only identifiable lesions being in neural tissue. Mortality of chickens infected with Marek's disease was quite low. Decades after the first vaccine was introduced, current strains of Marek virus cause lymphoma formation on throughout the chicken's body and mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens. The Marek's disease vaccine is a leaky vaccine, which means that only the symptoms of the disease are prevented. Infection of the host and the transmission of the virus are not inhibited by the vaccine. This contrasts with most other vaccines, where infection of the host is prevented. Under normal conditions, highly virulent strains of the virus are not selected. A highly virulent strain would kill the host before the virus would have an opportunity to transmit to other potential hosts and replicate. Thus, less virulent strains are selected. These strains are virulent enough to induce symptoms but not enough to kill the host, allowing further transmission. However, the leaky vaccine changes this evolutionary pressure and permits the evolution of highly virulent strains. The vaccine's inability to prevent infection and transmission allows the spread of highly virulent strains among vaccinated chickens. The fitness of the more virulent strains is increased by the vaccine.</p>
<p>If it's possible in chicken viruses, what's keeping our current leaky vaccines from doing something similar with the covid virus? I'm certainly no expert, but with the actual "experts" rapidly swinging from one set of assumptions to the next, especially this most recent one about how you do still spread covid once "vaccinated" it seems like we should not be doing what we're doing.  </p>
<p>Or maybe i'm just being a Chicken Little.</p>

        <p>Is it Big Pharma's goal to keep people in perpetual sickness? Yes.</p>
<p>Can they do it? Maybe. They certainly think so. However, all their modeling prior to this plandemic was only cased on a model of reality not reality itself. Lab conditions and small scale trials are nothing like the global rollout that is underway.</p>
<p>At this point, nobody can say how this experiment will end. However, millions are already dead from all this and millions more will die. Generally speaking, I believe it is more likely that the gene modified population will die out just like the animals this technology was tested on have. When you mess with nature, nature will mess with you.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a respiratory disease will not become very deadly. These diseases have selective pressure to be highly contagious and therefore not very lethal. A disease that requires the host to run around to spread it will not benefit from lethality like a disease that is transmitted through a parasite like Ebola, for example.</p>

        <p>I think there's a good chance of it happening, which admittedly will be the downside to not getting vaxxed, although we are all going to do of the shots one way or the other.</p>
<p>Maybe if a bunch of the people who take the shot really do die in 2 years, the selective pressure metrics will change again.</p>

        <p>The mechanisms are as different as apples and oranges.</p>
<p>The flu vaccine is a "best guess" at the next year's main strain, which is sometimes a wrong guess, but it's a "non-leaky" vaccine either way. It prevents the vaccinated from catching that strain of the flu, getting sick from that strain of the flu, or passing on that strain of the flu. The strains are different enough that if they guess wrong, it has no such effect on the actual extant strain.</p>
<p>The Marek scenario is that the vaccine keeps the virus from killing its host, but still allows it to be passed on.</p>
<p>The <em>current</em> selling point for the COVID vaccine is that it keeps the vaccinated from dying, but they'll still pass it on.</p>

        <p>Thankfully, bad viral vaccines have happened before - Dengue fever comes to mind - that have resulted in ADE and eventual vaccine failure. These treatments aren't even really vaccines and are quite novel, I'll grant you that, but we'd have to go quite far down the rabbit hole before this leaky treatment would result in a Marek's situation.</p>

        <p>Disagree that it’s quite far down the rabbit hole we have to go.  If the recent reports of increased breakthrough infections with viral loads as high or higher than unvaccinated people are accurate and end up being widespread, we have already created the perfect conditions for Marek’s-like selective pressure. The only limitation will be how deadly sars cov-2 can become I.e. just how bad is the most devastating combination of mutations in a new strain</p>

        <p>That's also true.</p>
<p>No, I agree with you - we're heading down the road to worst case scenario here -- but that doesn't mean it's likely that The Coof will become more deadly in general. It's not good, and the whole spectrum of mutations are on the table, though.</p>
<p>It's like we're living through a bad 50s sci-fi movie, where the scientists have no idea what they're doing, but they also don't realize it.</p>

        <p>Agree, overall, but the whole spectrum of mutations is not on the table. There is definitely selective pressure towards strains that reproduce more rapidly to overcome whatever half-assed antibody response the vaxxed population has. You’re right it doesn’t mean it will definitely get more deadly, but typically higher viral loads are associated with worse outcomes, so the odds are stacked against relatively benign mutations.</p>

        <p>That's absolutely true, but what I'm saying is that they gave this flawed vaccine to generations of chickens for a number of years before it got to this extent of bad.</p>

<p>This is a little bit worrying? Are we going to need to get vaccinated because the vaccinated people fucked it up for us?</p>
<p>Also a beautiful thing about nature is that nature is gonna nature. If a virus can do this in a chicken being guided by nothing but evolutionary pressure then there is no reason to think that it can't happen in humans being guided by the same evolutionary pressure.</p>

        <p>I guess the one thing you can take away is that it would take many generations. Average chicken lives 5-10 years and I'm sure the one raised for slaughter don't make it that far. If that change began in the 1970s that's almost 50 years of mutations in an animal with shorter lifespan. Which means the full impact of this vaccine may not be seen for hundreds of years. (If we make it that far).</p>

        <p>Yes, and if these were mutations within the chickens themselves that would be comforting, but if I'm reading this right it's the virus itself that's mutating so it doesn't necessarily need to pass from one generation of chickens to the next, but from one mutation of the virus to the next which could be happening at much shorter intervals.</p>

        <p>Human evolution got us this far, now we think we're smarter than the universe. This will be the universe (or God if you believe) way of bringing us back down a notch. The only thing that is certain in life is death, so don't fear it. Live each day and experience the richness and beauty that the universe has provided us for the short few seconds you have left. </p>
<p>Don't live in fear, it only serves to control you.</p>

        <p>I fear this also, but did this happen with swine flu vaccines? They tried the same scheme back then, scaring people into taking vaccines. There isnt seem to be swine flu anymore.</p>

        <p>I read this recently and it does seem to hold some valid points, I guess the difference would be our genetic make up compared with chickens … apparently we’re similar to mice genetically which is why they use them to test on (that’s their reasoning anyway) so it would be interesting to see some evidence based on that …</p>
