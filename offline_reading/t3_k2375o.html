    <strong>Why are people so anti mask?</strong>
    <p><p>It's such a minor thing. The issue with lockdowns is its ability to uproot and ruin people's lives, and the authoritarianism surrounding it. Masks do neither of that, its wrong for governments to enforce them, but not for people to wear them.</p>
<p>Being mad at people for wearing masks (and calling them muzzles is so fucking cringe too) is as just cringe as being mad at people for not wearing masks.</p></p>

        <p>Not really, you commented something similar, but you asked why people are antimask, I answered that they aren't, though i'll amend it to say "except for a few extremists."  There are very few people that are "anti-mask" they simply ask that you don't tell them they have to wear one, and that they won't tell you that you can't wear one.  The media, sadly have portrayed this message wrongly, as it's so prone to do to fit its desired narrative... That media portrayal may well have left you with the impression that there are a lot of anti-mask people out there... After all, the media does call us "anti-maskers."  Fortunately being called something doesn't make you that thing.</p>

        <p>Why are people so scared of coronavirus?</p>
<p>It's such a minor thing. The issue with severe illnesses like Ebola is its ability to cause internal bleeding resulting in vomiting or coughing blood, and the case fatality rate for around 50%. Coronavirus doesnâ€™t do any of that, its wrong for governments to make overreaching mandates in response to it, but not for people to take their own precautions as they see fit.</p>
<p>Being mad at people for not being afraid of coronavirus (and calling them plague rats is so fucking cringe too) is as just cringe as being mad at people for taking whatever precautions they choose to or not to take.</p>

        <p>I am anti-mask mandates for sure. If everyone wants to wear masks, they are free to do so and I could care less. But I should be free to NOT wear one. I also hate that I go places and have to try and get my kids to wear masks when I don't believe they really work or are necessary, especially since we aren't sick and wouldn't go out if we were. Trying to get a kid to follow a rule they know you don't agree with yourself is next to impossible. So being called a selfish person or a killer because I or my kids aren't wearing a mask is what really makes me mad. It translates to me hating masks and being "anti mask".</p>

        <p>Goddamn you people are fucking dense.  If NHTSA REQUIRED you to put a banana on the hood of your car because they say it reduces traffic accidents by 0.5% would you do it?</p>
<p>Thatâ€™s how most pro-mask-choice people feel.  Itâ€™s so obvious to so many people that the mask mandates donâ€™t do shit.</p>
<p>Again, and as MANY other folks point out here, if you want to wear a mask feel free, but the mandates are FUCKED UP, and encourage a whole pattern of other fucked up social norms that we need I be extremely vigilant about.</p>
<p>But go ahead and put the banana on your hood, and go around and judge others who donâ€™t I guess. /s</p>

        <p>Its like when people ask "why are people antivax?"</p>
<p>Most aren't against others getting vaccinated, theyre against the thought of the government forcing you to inject yourself with something.</p>
<p>Plus, why would it matter? If the masks and social distancing works, why would you care if someone 6 feet away from you is wearing a mask? </p>
<p>Just like if youre vaccinated, why would you care if others are? Do you go around your local grocery store and harass people who arent up-to-date on their flu shot?</p>

        <p>Bc fuck them, that's why. My local Government just extended the mask mandate until February with no end in sight. I don't want to be forced to wear one in every public place or get accosted by the pro mask people. That's like when PITA police come to your car on a mildly warm day and start yelling at you because your dog is inside with the windows rolled halfway down. It's not that serious, mind your fucking business and get out of here with that bullshit.</p>

        <p>I am also anti-forced mask because at that point they do become muzzles and symbol of human enslavement. People in certain jobs wear them for legit reasons, there is no reason for this. Yes many Asians always wore a mask but that is their own decision and is more common in their own cultures. It's covering the nose and mouth breaking down natural communication and stripping away much of the person's humanity since so much is expressed by the face and it's what we breathe through. The mask is not like for example a uniform given to you that you must wear while you are at work. It was forced down through threats and media propaganda one day and suddenly everyone had to accept it as the norm and then governors started issuing punishment for non-compliance with this nonsensical over reaction to nothing. They make me feel sick very quickly, give me brain fog, and I can't breathe properly in one. I am just barely able to work now because of it. Never mind that the whole of the situation has caused enough death and suffering as it is, more so than than something like any virus ever has never mind this joke of one that can't even be found. The damage isn't just going to reverse itself at some point either, it's permanent to many people and businesses. Where is the good in any of this, have you even bothered to glance at the bigger picture of what you are allowing by your consent into all of our lives?</p>

        <p>OP go tell people in /coronavirus sub to not wear a mask and see how much hate you get. Its goes both ways. I assume you are in in NYC and do you remember it was 2 weeks to flatten the curve? They will make so that you will need to take the covid vaccine to have access to do things you used to be able to do before covid. Also the death rate is less then 1% do you really think we need a vaccine or masks for such a slim %?</p>

        <p>There is evidence that shows mask mandates dont work. When they mask mandate the countries them the covid numbers still spike with masks. But believe whatever you want.</p>
