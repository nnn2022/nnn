    <strong>The current situation in Australia</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Victoria, Australia, and the situation at the moment with us and our neighbouring state NSW (New South Wales) is absolute madness.</p>
<p>In NSW, there are currently around 188 active cases. This is out of 144,000 tests in the last week (they have a total population of over 8 million people). An outbreak occurred in Sydney just before the new year, and now, just a week or so later, masks are mandatory in Sydney ($200 fines), there are stay-at-home restrictions, and visitor caps (e.g. max of 5 visitors from any number of households may visit another on any day).</p>
<p>Cases from NSW soon made their way to Victoria a few days ago, and now there are 32 active cases here, out of around 80,000 tests in the last week (total population of 6 million). Victoria shut their border to NSW a few days ago, announcing with a day's notice that anyone arriving in Victoria within 24 hours of midnight on the 1st of Jan would have to get tested and go into self-quarantine in their own residencies for 14 days, and anyone arriving after that would have to get tested and be forced into hotel quarantine for 14 days (which you have to pay yourself, by the way, $3000). This forced thousands of people to rush home, cutting their holidays short (it's currently summer here).</p>
<p>The vast majority of people are freaking out, and almost everyone supports the lockdowns and restrictions. I have no doubt we will enter yet ANOTHER lockdown in this police state. </p>
<p>Last year, Victoria went through two major lockdowns with batshit crazy restrictions, such as not being allowed to go to school, not being allowed outside for more than an hour's exercise a day, not being allowed to leave the house except for 4 essential reasons, not being allowed visitors... etc. Oh, and have I mentioned not being allowed to leave the country unless you get permission from the government (who only gives it out in special circumstances or if you have a very good reason that they approve of?) - this is STILL in place almost a year later! Half of the 2020 school year (approx 100 days) was spent in distance/online learning. Masks were mandatory for 6+ months EVERYWHERE and ANYTIME outside of your own home - and even now, they are still mandatory in most places. Basically, we had varying levels of restrictions for the entire year, and this only started to ease off a couple of months ago. Until a week ago, we'd gone 60 days without any local cases. </p>
<p>And now this. Look, perhaps it doesn't seem like a lot. Maybe it's not too bad. But you have to remember that this is all in response to around 200 cases across the two states, with a total combined population of 14 MILLION people. Am I crazy, or is the world crazy? NO ONE HAS DIED YET here!! The survival rate is what, over 98%!? I'm so sick and tired of all this bullshit. This is madness!</p></p>

        <p>I think it needs to be more organized. Form local communities and groups. Defy lockdowns and don’t wear masks. Recruit, recruit, recruit ...</p>
<p>That’s the only mentality that can work. There’s power when you are a majority. We know people are out there but no solid organized protests for everyone.</p>
<p>If Antifa can recruit so many libs — we should have no problem forming groups especially in the bigger cities.</p>

        <p>I hate to say this, but they are using Australia as a testing ground for this kind of harsh lockdown. </p>
<p>I honestly see this going on for a long time. As /u/agent2424 says, we'd need mass protests and mass civil disobedience to make this stop. But people are championing this. They love being oppressed, they love snitching on their neighbors, they love seeing everyone else brought down to their level of misery. I have no idea what can be done in response. We're just a small chunk of the population (26k in this sub, around 700k signatures on the GBD), and spread out across the world. Aside from bitching in this sub, signing useless petitions, and partaking in tiny ass protests, I have no idea what more <em>we</em> can do.</p>

        <p>I'm horrified by Australia's response to COVID and have been since I found out about it... especially Victoria's. What's scary, too, is that there are Canadians that think we should lock down like Australia. They think it'll bring the case number to 0, but as you can see from your story, that just doesn't work. I hope you aren't put into lockdown again. Maybe if you are able to leave the country for one of those approved reasons, you just shouldn't go back. If anything, I'd try to move to a rural area that isn't as Draconian.</p>

        <p>The problem is that this rollout is happening globally. All you'd be doing is running temporarily. It will catch up to you eventually. I know everyone here will scream "SOUTH DAKOTA! FLORIDA!" But if this agenda continues forward, those states will eventually succumb as well. As I said in another comment here, Noem will not be governor forever, and DeSantis locked down once already so I don't trust him (and even still, he will also stop being governor eventually as well).</p>

        <p>I get that, but some places will always be a bit better than others. I don't think anyplace can be as bad as Victoria, Australia, for instance. Heck, someone could constantly move around, if possible, to take advantage of the least restrictive places in any given year. :P</p>

        <p>I think the potential is there. If there is an agenda at play here, then this is going to be a global takeover, and every place will enact the same restrictions: masks, rolling lockdowns, curfews, etc. Most countries are already acting in lockstep with each other.</p>

        <p>The problem is, they will likely go after dissidents who try to flee. </p>
<p>Look, the solution is for more people to fight back in more aggressive (but non-violent) ways with protests and civil disobedience. By more, I mean millions need to rise up.</p>

        <p>I thought everyone in Vic was pretty much joined in their mutual despising of dictator Dan? How quickly people forget eh? Sorry it's so bad down there. I'm waiting for Qld to follow suit again soon, we have zero cases, so that seems to be the prerequisite for a lockdown doesn't it?</p>

        <p>I'll take my chances and I have that right.  And if it doesn't prevent transmission nobody can say my decisions affect them.  You're going to find out in the next 3 or 4 months how bad this is going to get.  If you support your fellow Australians being detained for refusing a vaccine or for wanting to do simple things like walking outside for more than an hour that's your prerogative.  I think it's fucking crazy but unfortunately I don't think you're alone.</p>

        <p>So lockdown until everyone is vaccinated? Another couple months of lockdown will just further crush the economy and small businesses.</p>
<p>Plus the vaccine won’t necessarily end the lockdowns. The government can always manipulate the PCR tests to get the numbers they want. And what if people don’t want the vaccine? Do you want lockdowns to go on until everyone is forcibly vaccinated?</p>
