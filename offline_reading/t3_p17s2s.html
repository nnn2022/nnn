    <strong>Following the Science: Me vs You</strong>
    <p><p>Following the Science:</p>
<p>What I did: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experienced 30+ years with an autoimmune disease, visited western medicine/big pharma doctors and also natural/integrative medicine doctors in my three decade pursuit of health and healing </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intuitively and instinctively knew that the "facts" the western medicine doctors were telling me were not the truth (such as "stress doesn't affect flares" and "diet doesn't matter" and "you can't heal this" and "the disease does what it wants") </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experienced inflated egos and the bought and paid for "standard of care" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was expected to "listen to the experts" and not question anything </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tried different types of recommended pharmaceuticals anyway throughout the years which either did nothing or caused additional side effects while not healing anything, and in fact made the symptoms worse </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was offered additional pharmaceuticals to combat the side effects of the original pharmaceuticals </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was only ever given options for pharmaceuticals and surgery, any mention of diet or vitamins or stress or emotional health was deemed insignificant and disregarded </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had my curious and rebellious nature lead me to do my own research into the health of the human body and seek out medical professionals whose views on health were in alignment with my intuition </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spent years reading books, along with watching documentaries and listening to podcasts by doctors, scientists, medical professionals and historians regarding: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>immune system health and the diet connection</p>
</li>
<li>the benefits of proper nutrition and the detrimental effects of toxins in processed food and alcohol</li>
<li>the side effects of common medications</li>
<li>the vagus nerve, its function in the body and effect on the digestive system</li>
<li>the important function and delicate balance of the microbiome</li>
<li>the gut/brain connection</li>
<li>homeostasis and full body healing by using food as medicine
-Â  the negative effects of stress, fear and anxiety on the immune system, and the positive effects of meditation and nature </li>
<li>the mind body balance </li>
<li>the incredible benefits of exercise, fresh air and sunshine to physical, mental and emotional health</li>
<li>sustainable and organic farming</li>
<li>corruption in the American food industry and advertising</li>
<li>documented and irrefutable historical events involving pharmaceuticals</li>
<li>documented and irrefutable historical events involving the agricultural industry </li>
<li>documented and irrefutable historical events involving chemicals and pesticides</li>
<li>documented and irrefutable historical events involving lawsuits and settlements against pharmaceutical companies after medications and vaccines caused damage and death</li>
<li>leaky vaccines that may spread a virus even more</li>
<li>medical malpractice and medical errors</li>
<li>the efforts to shut down, silence and discredit doctors and all others who practice natural health</li>
<li>the Nuremberg code and HIPAA violations</li>
<li>the Flexner report, the American Medical Association and the absolutely corrupt takeover of medical education in the United States by those who could afford to buy it</li>
<li>corruptions, payoffs, power and control in government </li>
<li>corruption, payoffs and profits within the pharmaceutical industry</li>
<li>advertisements geared towards what is socially acceptable (liquor, junk food) </li>
<li>the demonization of herbs and plants</li>
<li>the backlash against critical thinking and
body autonomy</li>
<li>silencing and cancellation of anything that doesn't fit the narrative and doesn't create profit</li>
<li>operation mockingbird, project mockingbird, the patriot act, cambridge analytical, Edward Snowden </li>
<li>wars, government corruptions and power plays</li>
<li>tyrannical and communistic governments in other countries </li>
<li>the outrageous and indefensible pricing inflation of pharmaceuticals and medical procedures in the US </li>
<li>assassinations of whistle blowers within both the government and health care industries</li>
<li>silencing of those who have made scientific discoveries that would change the current treatment course of cancer and other life changing diseases</li>
<li>corruption and profits among "charities" and for-profit research foundations</li>
<li>CIA and military experiments on human subjects with and without their knowledge </li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attended medical seminars open to the public in my free time </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Healed myself and my immune system by changing my diet, mindset and lifestyle </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witnessed the detrimental American diet in hospitals, a place that should be nourishing the body but is not </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Became active in the fight for our right to use plants and herbs as medicine without government interception and punishment </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realized the importance of body autonomy and individual medical decision making </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read up on conflicting points of view so as to avoid confirmation bias </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witnessed the authors of the books, documentaries and podcasts be proven correct over and over again </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revolved my life around both the pursuit of knowledge and optimization of my immune system as the basis of full body homeostasis </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Realized the amount of advertising and mind games that go into promoting the normalization of what we refer to as "food"</li>
<li>that our food and lifestyles are making us sick </li>
<li>that there are profits to be made from cheap food</li>
<li>that the FDA approves additives and pesticides in the US that are banned in other countries and it is driven exclusively by profits </li>
<li>that making change is a slow battle and in the meantime we all suffer</li>
<li>that modern medicine "health care" is really sick care</li>
<li>that modern medicine offers you a pharmaceutical to soothe the symptoms of your illness, but does not heal the illness itself</li>
<li>that if modern medicine was really concerned about "health care" there would be focus on healthy diets, mental and emotional health, exercise and disease prevention</li>
<li>instead, modern medicine doesn't get involved until the patient is already sick and thus reliant on them</li>
<li>that if hospitals cared about your health, they wouldn't serve you a sandwich made of white bread and lunch meat, a bag of potato chips and a can of coca cola (personal experience) </li>
<li>that modern medicine sees each disease as an isolated problem instead of seeing the body as a whole, a complex machine with systems that affect the entire body and have the capacity to heal</li>
<li>that the alternative medicine doctors who do believe the body works as a complex whole are mocked as "quacks" by those who would stand to lose profits</li>
<li>this is parroted by those who feel threatened that maybe they've been wrong and would have to face personal liability </li>
<li>that "alternative" medicine is original medicine</li>
<li>that an optimal immune system, obtained by inconvenient and sometimes difficult diet and lifestyle changes, is the true key to health</li>
<li>that if those in charge really cared about your health, the system would be run completely different</li>
<li>
<p>currently it's designed to maximize profits </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realized that it is ALL connected </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...All before I ever heard of COVID-19 </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>After COVID-19: </p>
<p>Spent several hours a day reading books, along with watching documentaries and listening to podcasts by doctors, scientists, biologists, medical professionals, historians and experts who have been proven correct in the past and are now applying that knowledge to in depth explanations of: </p>
<ul>
<li>unreliable PCR test results</li>
<li>skewed numbers of covid positive tests and the difference between those who died of covid and with covid </li>
<li>affordable, safe, readily available medications that have been proven to help the body fight off COVID-19 but which have expired patents and therefore do not create profit</li>
<li>history of the experimental mRNA shots </li>
<li>history of gain of function research </li>
<li>the changing of the definition of "immunity" to remove natural immunity </li>
<li>the after effects of the vaccine that have been emerging and then getting censored by the mainstream</li>
<li>censorship of any opinion that goes against the narrative</li>
<li>documented and irrefutable historical events involving Anthony Fauci</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was expected to "listen to the experts" and not question anything </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledged that the shot is experimental and there is no long term safety data </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read up on conflicting points of view so as to avoid confirmation bias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witnessed constant inconsistency and changing narratives along with gross hypocrisy by the government and celebrity influencers </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witnessed the desperation of the shot propaganda, the attempts at coercion and the firing of even health care employees who do not want to volunteer for an experimental treatment </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spent a lifetime reading, studying and observing health and the human body along with government and healthcare corruption </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have come to conclude that having an optimal immune system is the key to healing both chronic disease including cancer and a virus like SARS-CoV-2 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am concerned that there have not been enough studies done on this experimental shot and if we realize too late that there are undiscovered consequences, it will negatively affect a large portion of humanity </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Came to the independent conclusion that I do not want to receive an experimental mRNA shot </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>What you did: </p>
<p>-Watched TV </p>
<p>-Logged onto Twitter</p>
<p>-Logged onto Facebook</p>
<p>-Logged onto Tiktok </p>
<p>Got your shot, your free donut, your free Sam Adams and sat your sedentary ass in front of the computer with a bag of Doritos and your door dash app to absorb and regurgitatate propaganda, and argue with people like me about "following the science."</p></p>

        <p>I have never read anything that has explained my experience more than this. 
The food supply monopoly, disgusting and cringey false advertising, MK Ultra, the consistent censorship and hypocrisy. The vicious attacks on peopleâs intelligence and character rather than a scientific debate, the media calling people âcrazy conspiracy theorists,â and people spouting out their assumptions of you if you imply one part of the narrative as being wrong. All of these things I have been dealing with on my own and trying to come to terms with how the system works and how people continuously fail to recognize the fundamental flaws of synthetic food, medicine and research. It all has to do with money and itâs sickening. The hierarchy in todayâs world hides behind the perception that they want the best for everyone, yet live in their illumined reality knowing and laughing that they have us idiots fooled. Those who seek out power are more likely to be sociopaths, and guess what?? They donât give a fuck about any of us, they just want to continue to inflate their own ego with monetary reward and success of mass manipulation.</p>

<p>My own personal experience.</p>
<p>Trusting doctors, employers, wcb, politicians, and people who dont know you, so they dont care about you can be a lethal mistake. Your just a case file to these people.</p>
<p>I find my case extremely relative to covid, because the effects that I experienced is what alot of people are experiencing with the heart inflammation. Because of that, I will never ever get this shot. Before being poisoned with refrigerant, I likely would have bent over to keep my job, but I cant even hold or find a full time job now. Now I cant really be threatened to take the shot anymore, and at this point I dont care if I end up homeless. I really dont, society is broke.</p>
<p>Its a two tiered system where those with wealth are treated with the freedoms and respect they deserve, and the poor and uneducated are treated like domestic animals.</p>
