    <strong>Observations, reflections, conspiracies and finding gratitude for what we know about modern humanity's true colors</strong>
    <p><p>Been visiting and contributing here for some time now, at a relatively high volume, and so I had figured now may be the right time for some ruminations.</p>
<p>The need for a society free of any risks, the way in which we've been distorted into choosing certain lives as being more equal than others on a completely arbitrary basis - see the grotesque calls for those who died of Covid to have memorials ahead of the millions of cancer victims - and the rejection for a need to improve quality of live has been massively disturbing and enlightening at the same time. When making the case for Sweden's policy being an abysmal failure, numerous times it would be centered around protests on how it supposedly ignored the plight of 80 year olds clinging to life and the fact that a select few of them could've had *a few more good years*. Unprecedented good times, the need to artificially extend life and give no consideration to the extent to which said lives are being lived with purpose, the ability of a select few individuals who can't get over their inability to connect with the world to coerce huge segments of the rest of society along with them have been soul crushing but in a way this is information we were inevitably going to learn as technology and living standards went about their irreversible progress. And truthfully, it's information we needed to know.</p>
<p>Once the time is right politically and culturally, this plague will be declared as a conquered threat no more to be feared than an atypically bad flu. Hence way I believe in avoiding reverse doomerism as a way to fully address it. The vast majority of civilization will be too busy embracing what is now a newfound freedom to shop, travel, dance to WAP at clubs, attend weddings, hug family, friends and strangers and stand closer in line to people to concern themselves with how much they've become pigeons electing hawks to be their leaders. Business owners and other key producers of society will have incentive and in many cases desire to take note but will have too many immediate obligations on their plate to do much of anything about it.</p>
<p>None of that changes that the curtain has been pulled on how much our progression has stunted us and how much our free will has been threatened. I legit realize the following could end up placing me firmly in tinfoil hat QAnon Black Helicopter New World Order territory. I really do. Nonetheless, the more I look at the motivations and gains of big tech, big corp cronyists, politically driven medical experts and authoritarians, and just how much they overlap with those of China's it's also clear that if we could've magically made Covid vanish before this year, we'd still be in this exact same spot. *Something* was gonna spring up to be used as a springboard to coerce the public into this.  I've been trying for years, physically exerting myself, to avoid any type of thinking that could be called as conspiracy minded but it's becoming a gargantuan uphill battle.  I can't fathom how anyone could look at Fauci, look at his face, eyes, mannerisms, and think for a millisecond his motives are purely centered on public health and saving lives. This opportunity to have society suffer and become powerless in their own lives, just as he no doubt for a lifetime, is Christmas coming all year round for the tool. Ditto for Osterholm, Cuomo, Newsom, de Blasio, Whitmer, the political and medical leaders on the same power trip.</p>
<p>This means that first off, it doesn't do a lot of good on any level to lament about what would've happened without a pandemic, as much as every one of us, me too of course, has found themselves doing at some point. The progression and degradation of civilization means it was as inevitable as moving away from horse drawn carriages. Furthermore, it means in order to ensure our mental, emotional and spiritual health can withstand the obscene tribalism, gaslighting and sheep mentality, which is just gonna get worse, we could stand to turn it around and see this as a chance to enlighten ourselves about how humanity functions and make proactive reaction plans, work to change and in many cases actively combat and destroy it and plan our course for living the most meaningful lives we can with what we know.</p></p>
