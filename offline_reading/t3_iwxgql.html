    <strong>Anybody else feeling increasingly helpless?</strong>
    <p><p>We are more than half a year into unprecedented restrictions on our civil rights. Even more unreal, it is basically the same everywhere around the world. This has changed the fabric of our society. </p>
<p>Social interactions are basically banned. You are not supposed to talk to strangers, even stand at a physical distance from them. You are to wear a mask to show your support for this new and sick society. All the businesses that were involved in fun or social interactions will go bankrupt. Their place will be taken by big corporations, those that have enough money to weather this situation, or even profit from it.</p>
<p>In Germany we are already told that masks, and some of the measures will stay, even after a vaccine. The hygiene dictatorship is already looking at the flu and other sicknesses to justify prolonged measures. Wherever a small pocket of dissent comes up, usually Generation X'ers gathering in public places for drinks and to meet friends (which is what we do), arise calls for drastic punishment.</p>
<p>I think of this as being similar to the gym. It is not a social place. You go in there with your tunnel vision, go about your business and then leave. This has now been extended to all parts of society. We have indeed become China, were people are drones that only exist to work and do nothing else. Somehow working in the office is not a problem, but everything else is.</p>
<p>I am getting sick to the stomach when I see the consequences of this everyday. Maximum obedience, nobody to question authority. An utterly strange alliance of leftists and the government. The new SA, Blockwarts and struggle sessions, denouncing your neighbours for the crime of meeting other people.</p>
<p>How do you deal with this? Please don't come at me with "just focus on improving yourself" crap. I am not a social butterfly at all and I am feeling the effects of this every day. It seems to me that moving to Sweden, not exactly the most social country, the most affordable country or the country with the most pleasant weather, is the only way to truly resist this. (South Dakota for the US folks in here). </p>
<p>And I'm not saying "until this is over" because it won't be. I am putting money down that most countries will keep the restrictions through 2021, possibly for a much longer time.</p></p>

<p>People are starting to realize that Covid isn’t a huge treat.  But based on how Goverments are acting they definetly are a serious threat</p>

        <p>I was at the protest in London on Saturday, thousands were there.</p>
<p>Peaceful protest in Trafalgar square.</p>
<p>They sent in the riot police!</p>
<p>You know what happened? We held them back! Three times! Then they gave up.</p>
<p>They thought we were going to be some soft-middle class left-wingers and we weren't.</p>
<p>We finished the protest and they swarmed a few of the remaining protesters, beat the shit out of them and arrested them.</p>
<p>They failed to break up the protest, failed to bring it to an end.</p>
<p>There's enough angry people all over the world now that the use of force isn't an option anymore if you stand up and don't back down.</p>
<p>Since this all started I've never felt so hopeful.</p>

        <p>Yep. I couldn’t have ever thought that six months later I’d still have very little to look forward to in life. Just another day of WFH followed by whatever heavily regulated activities or errands I need or can bring myself to do. It really does feel like I’ve lost my freedom and the country is going to hell in a hand basket. All because a bunch of hysterical people can’t handle the risk of catching a virus they’re more than likely to survive. I feel so much anger at the state of our society and the entitlement of people who are at NO risk for corona who think they should be “protected” everywhere. </p>
<p>I have to laugh when people say “Well PA (my state) is pretty much open!” Huh? I can’t sit at a bar if I want. I have to stop ordering alcohol and drinking at an arbitrary time. I can’t go to a sporting event. I can only go to a hair salon if I call ahead when I arrive and get my temperature checked. I can’t try on clothes in some stores. This is not “pretty open” or “normal.”</p>

        <p>The other day I was talking to someone about restrictions. He mentioned that his daughter, who lives overseas, had bought a plane ticket to visit him for Christmas even though it's likely that the borders will be closed still. He has a good relationship with her so obviously wants the visit to happen. Yet he followed up by saying, "well the lockdown hasn't really affected my life at all!" Yes it fucking well has! How do these people not understand that?!</p>

        <p>Yes I am...I’ve given up hope of returning to normal until next summer.  My state is hell bent on keeping masks and social distancing until flu season is over.  Kids are still out of school and the remote learning is such a crock of sh*t.  Can’t believe this is actually still happening and we have such short sided people in charge.  I used to think by fall this will all be over but nope here we are and they’ve managed to push this even further</p>

        <p>The governors and health officials are just as scared as the general public. Wolf literally refuses to lift restrictions because there will be more cases. He’s only feeding the myth that we can hide from this harder and it will just go away if we stay under our bed.</p>

        <p>Not feeling helpless, but rather depressed and angry.  A large part of that is the isolation the WFH move and restrictions.  While not a social butterfly, I do like seeing other folks and realize the impact of seeing folks in masks has on the mental health.  Late Aug I attended a Law Enforcement Appreciation event held by a friend's parents. Easily 200 folks, not a single mask in sight.  That REALLY boosted the mood for a while. </p>
<p>I push back when I can against the frelling face diaper nonsense.  I NEVER wear it when I'm outside, only when in a store subject to mandates from our Gov, County and local municipalities.  The thin single layer item goes on just before I enter, and off as soon as I'm on my way out.  I also refuse to interact with others wearing the damn things since they muffle the voice and obscure the lips, the movement of which I rely on to know what folks are saying due to hearing impairment.</p>

        <p>I'm really interested in the history of neighbor reporting AKA snitching. Germany has quite the history with that. Could you please point us to any publications with regard to neighbor shaming/reporting in German context?</p>
<p>Is this still allowed there? We have a massive problem with it here. Immediately, upon enacting social distancing restrictions here there were tons of tattle tales turning in their neighbors (many times falsely). My understanding is that here in the states we are protected by open records laws, but these can easily be withheld or redacted by public officials. Nonetheless, people assume they are anonymous snitches, when that is illegal.</p>
<p>The public health brigades can't be everywhere, so they depend on these squealers to do their dirty work. Normal folks don't really understand how sinister these finks are, but with the history of Stasis and Nazism in Germany there must be an abundance of literature on the damaging nature of these stool pigeons. I would appreciate anything you could point be toward.</p>
<p>oh yeah, don't feel helpless. We have no choice but to resist these apocalyptic fetishists , these end-times nut jobs. Flout the rules and never tire of non-compliance.</p>

        <p>Pray. Find like minds. Stay healthy. Collect and save information. Make sure you have supplies and your car is in top shape. Procure arms. Spread info by way of indirect methods. Wake people slowly without confrontation and attention.</p>
<p>You will be in my prayers today.</p>

        <p>There was a big protest in Berlin not everyone thinks these rules are fine, but most people were anyway already dead even before this bullshit, just working and going home so they don't care.
A lot of people don't protest just go to parties illegally, if you search you will find them.
But going only to illegal parties is selfish and won't change the situation.</p>

        <p>Yes I was going to some of those, dubbed "Partyszene" by the media and shamed. But this is really the only way to non violently protest for Gen Xers. I don't know what you mean by selfish. Protest is indeed linked to some conspiracy nut (not saying the majority of people are), so partys are an outlet for people not willing to out themselves politically.</p>
