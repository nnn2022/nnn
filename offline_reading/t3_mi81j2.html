        <p>I love pre-COVID science.  Science has been replaced by money-driven dogma.  Now it's <em>THE SCIENCE</em> and <em>EXPERTS AGREE</em>, and if you question anything, you are a <em>SCIENCE DENIER</em>!</p>
<p>Anyone actually following the scientific method, is now a science denier.</p>
<p>The same strategy will be used to create the next Public Health Emergency--Climate Change.</p>

        <p>Yep. Hope nobody gets tired of this post but it's necessary. </p>
<p>Politically motivated and funded research is not in any way the same as objective scientific research. Most seem to recognize that politics are playing a role in the covid pandemic and reactions to it, yet they choose to deny that the science has been changed to fit political agendas. However, there are clear instances of this happening, whether the changes are for profit or to save one’s career is what we cannot know. Believing these overnight 180s in scientific outcomes, and ignoring the role politics play, is akin to biologists saying Creationism is suddenly proven over evolution, right after mass Young Earth Creationist funding, and people just accepting it as true!  </p>
<p>The best example is the very New EnglandJournalofMedicine, one of the most reputable sources. In July 2020 the authors made this statement: </p>
<p>&rt;"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong>"  </p>
<p>But what were the actual findings regarding masks OUTSIDE a health care facility in this study?  </p>
<p>&rt;"We know that <strong>wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection</strong> from infection... The <strong>chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.</strong> In many cases, the <strong>desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>... Focusing on universal <strong>masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures</strong>... It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that <strong>fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....."</strong> </p>
<p>Does this sound like a push for masking outside of health care facilities? Or even really in them aside from their symbolism? This is nothing but a blatant contradiction of their findings to save their careers in our cancel culture.  </p>
<p>Another example of this horror is an article on why facemasks don't work by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC. He concluded:  </p>
<p>&rt;"Literature reviews have confirmed that <strong>wearing a mask during surgery has no impact whatsoever on wound infection rates during clean surgery... No matter how well a mask conforms to the shape of a person’s face, it is not designed to create an air tight seal around the face... a study of eight brands of face masks found that they did not filter out 20-100% of particles</strong> ... etc."  </p>
<p>Yet if you don't have an archived link, here is what you now see:  </p>
<p>&rt;"If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, <strong>it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</strong>"  </p>
<p>Our "current climate" is one that prefers fear over fact, control over science and reason, submission over freedom</p>

        <p>What I love about this is how many people have suddenly become scientists, and how those scientists that go against the mainstream are dismissed as ideologists. At least in my home country I feel like they all get a voice, and even university faculty leaders with lots of reputation to lose don't feel uncomfortable voicing their opinion. </p>
<p>With that said, I'm personally wearing masks while the pandemic goes on, as I believe if everyone does it might offer some protection, but I'm still quite skeptical and I won't keep doing it after the pandemic like some suggest.</p>

        <p>You can often feel a sneeze coming on. Most surgeons likely would turn away if about to sneeze (get a scalpel and piece of fish and try to cut precisely mid-sneeze). Masks probably prevent very little “splatter” in the doctor-to-patient direction due to that. </p>
<p>Masks stop light splatter in both directions. Masks keep your snot from flying into the patient and the patient’s blood from squirting into your mouth. The most likely explanation for this difference is that light splatter isn’t a significant source of transmission of infection, mask or not, while an optimal gross-stuff breeding environment composed of tiny fibers that can and do shed while you breathe <em>may</em> be a significant source of infections.</p>

        <p>They have masks for staff if they want it but patients can't be forced. But if you are confirmed infected with a disease that make you sneeze and cough, you will probably be asked to put one on. That seems to be reasonable, it does stop droplets from flying all over the room. It gives you a little time to get into an empty room not exposing others to your fountains of viruses. But it doesn't help in the long run. The effect fades away while the mask gets wet.</p>
