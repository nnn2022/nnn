    <strong>More Edmonton stupidity - just in time for the Christmas shopping rush!!!</strong>
    <p><p>Below is a copy and paste from my city's website with the latest restrictions in the War on Grandma-Flu.</p>
<p><em>Most retail businesses may remain open with capacity limited to</em> <strong><em>25% of the occupancy</em></strong> <em>set under the Alberta Fire Code.</em></p>
<p><em>Retail, including liquor and cannabis, Grocery stores, Pharmacies, Clothing stores, Computer and technology stores, Hardware, Automotive, Alberta approved farmers' markets, Unlicensed outdoor seasonal markets</em></p>
<p>So much stupid here, so where do I start??? How about:</p>
<p>- Its winter here! Soon it will be a balmy -20 or so on a regular basis. Instead of grandma catching WuFlu, she's gonna be  in the ER for fucking frostbite from standing in line outside!</p>
<p>- It's fucking dark out at 4 in the afternoon. I  really want to stand outside waiting to get groceries like I'm trapped in a train tunnel.</p>
<p>- This will encourage hoarding and empty shelves (again). Hope you don't run out of toilet paper!</p>
<p>- The mask Karens will be emboldened. Expect to now get harassed while you wait in our new Soviet-style bread lines, let alone when you actually get in the store. And no doubt the rent-a-cops controlling access will be even more insufferable.</p>
<p>- As a statement by governments and businesses that my fucking time when I'm not at work is of no perceived value, this is off the charts.</p>
<p>- Delivery services will be overwhelmed by people trying to avoid this bullshit - meaning people who legitimately can't get out for groceries (sick, quarantined, handicapped. elderly, no vehicle) will wait even longer to get deliveries.</p>
<p>This is blatantly a rule brought in by politicians and bureaucrats who are insulated from our reality and don't give a shit about the average Joe - because they have minions to do their shopping for them, or they will get special treatment. May they rot in hell.</p>
<p>I'm going to start looking up what areas outside the city don't enforce this stupid shit. I'd rather drive an hour each way for groceries than spend money in this dystopian hellhole, or waste my time in artificially-created lineups!</p></p>

        <p>Lol I just had to point out your name. I wouldn't be bragging about being that woman's(?) surgeon.</p>
<p>This stupidity extends to Calgary too. The day people were expecting a lockdown i went to superstore for gas and seen 3 different carts being pushed out of the grocery store at the same time with 2 packs of toilet paper per cart. Went back yesterday for a couple things and of course the shelves were empty again.</p>

<p>I tried telling her that Botox would work better, but she insisted on me using the blowtorch and a wire brush instead!</p>

        <p>A disciple of Saint Anthony I take it. You must think our politicians have done such a good job that they should be running all of healthcare. It’s only a $4 trillion sector. Why not simply create the largest government bureaucracy in human history? How hard could it be? Socialism works, and it works even better at scale. When more is at stake, politicians will make the right call. That’s Science. Very sane.</p>

        <p>You realise Americans pay more health care related TAXES on average then Canadians right? Outside of the American military the American healthcare sector is the biggest government bureaucracy on earth.</p>
<p>Also, you don't know what socialism is lol. Socialism is a system where the workers own the means of production. Last time I checked the doctors and nurses didn't own the hospitals. Though that would take it out of the hands of the government so...you'd be in favour of that?</p>
