    <strong>I have to say in my understanding and research masks help and the disease is real everything else generally being said is true</strong>
    <p><p>The big reset. 
The biggest wealth and power  grab in history.
Anti privacy rights and freedom being made law.
Something like this happens every 8 to 10 years
As far as I know it's an old banking technique 
Lend money and then on the eight year 
They stopped lending money and call in all debts</p>
<p>There's a Jewish name for it but I can remember and it doesn't matter.
This is what the drone people need to wake up to 
No all the nonsense of gender woke stuff no1 cares if you want to change gender </p>
<p>It is just fud the media use to distract from the reality </p>
<p>Of inequality 
Control 
Power 
Corruption 
Market manipulation
Wealth grabs</p>
<p>Priority should be with your lower middle classes</p>
<p>That is the war us against them</p>
<p>Stop fighting waitresses or anyone in or around your class </p>
<p>And all peoples classes are against the billionaires </p>
<p>And shadow powers </p>
<p>We outnumber them we have the power if we wake the fuck up to that power</p></p>

        <p>I think you're a little confused. The seventh year is called the Shemitah, or Sabbatical year. If you are an observant Jew, it is incumbent upon you to forgive all debts at that time. I wonder if that has anything to do with how bad credit is normally taken off records after seven years?</p>
<p>So it is a kind of reset, but not the one that's currently being pushed.</p>
