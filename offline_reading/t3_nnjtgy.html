        <p>It raises big red flags for me that they label you as anti-vax for having even the slightest degree of skepticism of any vaccine. </p>
<p>I'm not anti-vax. I've even worked to promote the rabies vaccine! If I got bit by a rabid animal, damn straight I'd be on my way to a hospital to get my rabies vaccine. </p>
<p>The difference between rabies and Covid is that rabies has a 99% fatality rate and the vaccine has a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>You don't need a media propaganda machine or censorship when it comes to the rabies vaccine. You don't need to lie and say there is no side effects. The side effects suck massively, but the alternative is near-certain death if you have bit by a rabid animal! </p>
<p>Covid on the other hand has a 99% survival rate.</p>
<p>Let's also not forget that in early 2020 there were various therapies proposed for Covid, but they were shunned by the media because "they are not FDA approved for treatment of Covid-19." They said that despite overwhelming evidence that they ARE effective. </p>
<p>Now we've come full circle and the media propaganda machine is running, this time in an attempt to brainwash everyone into taking the Covid-19 vaccine, and guilt-trip anyone that is slightly skeptical, despite none of the vaccines being FDA approved. </p>
<p>Sorry, but I refuse to take any vaccine that is not FDA approved. </p>
<p>I also refuse to take any vaccine for Covid-19. I believe that I already had Covid (will get an anti-bodies test to confirm later), but also in my health &amp; age group I have a 99.99% chance of survival. </p>
<p>What are the benefits to taking something made by humans in labs when I have a 9,999/10,000 chance of survival? It's probably even HIGHER because the stats don't account for health, just age groups. </p>
<p>If your "sCIenCe" is so weak that one can't make a reasonable counter-argument or even be skeptical without massive shaving, labeling, and media campaigns to place you into the anti-vax group, then maybe your magical "Science" isn't actually scientific? </p>
<p>I don't need to censor my opponents. I reviewed the data and choose to make an educated choice for my health and life. What does any of that have to do with YOU? </p>
<p>Furthermore, the intensive media fear-mongering and propaganda has encouraged me to become even <em>more</em> skeptical of other vaccines and situations. Were vaccines really as safe as I thought before? Or was that a lie brainwashed via repetition into my skull by the government &amp; media? </p>
<p>If the CIA declassified files have taught us anything, it's that the government and authority is completely NON-deserving of our absolute trust and faith. They have failed us time and time again, and that is why they seek to censor &amp; shame - they can't win on logic.</p>

        <p>99% survival rate would be terrible news.  The actual survival rate is far higher.  Let's use the precise numbers, because the fascist worldwide government and corporation response is INSANE.</p>
<p>According to Dr. John Ioannidas of Stanford, the worldwide infection fatality rate for people under 70 is 0.05% and including the population of people over 70 brings the total to 0.15%.  An average flu season is about 0.1%.  At worst this is a bad flu season.</p>
<p>Back in October the WHO estimated that 10% of the world population had been infected with about 1.2 million attributed deaths. (a number that might be 5-10x too high because of the crappy rigged PCR testing and hospitals paid to include Covid as a cause of death).  The infection fatality rate of those numbers?  Exactly 0.15%.  And again, that's a high-end estimate.</p>
<p>Given the ridiculous diagnostic criteria and testing to pump the numbers, Covid-19 might in reality have a 99.99% survival rate if people are actually offered HCQ, Favipiravir or Ivermectin, which are part of a treatment flowchart that has reduced hospitalizations and fatalities in observed populations by approximately 85% according to Dr. Peter McCullough, who pioneered the research on the therapies by April and May of 2020 (it's about a 5-6 drug cocktail that obliterates the worst outcomes of the virus- for example: Ivermectin, Doxycycline, Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, SUNSHINE).  And for worsening cases, use a combination of Prednisone (basic steroid to give body strength to fight better) with Colchicine (used for gout) to fight the circulatory issues with a last stand using Aspirin (325mg high heart attack prevention dose) and Heparin (used for blood clots).</p>
<p>If you want absolute proof that the establishment wants more people to die from Covid-19 to keep up the scam and that Google is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, Google search Peter McCullough and then do the same with DuckDuckGo.  The top results of one search tell you he is a doctor in Dallas, the top results of the other search tell you the details of a lifesaving treatment from complications of a disease you either already had or will probably get at some point.  Why else would Google try to suppress the results that could save your life?</p>

        <p>Here's something interesting </p>
<p>The researchers also found that people with asthma had a 14 percent lower risk of developing COVID-19 and were significantly less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19.
I have asthma and am regularly treated with prednisone and a nebulizer of a medication called sarbutimal with oxygen. 
That less people with asthma die and especially are hospitalized with covid only makes sense because doctors are "allowed" to treat the asthma.  No asthma means no treatment. It's no less than criminal.</p>

        <p>There’s no plausible biochemical pathway for any of those treatments you’ve listed, the science on that is unambiguous.  Certainly not ivermectin, it’s a chloride channel agonist.</p>

        <p>Or read one of the hundreds of studies.</p>
<p>Covid-19 acts in a primarily vascular manner despite being spread as a respiratory pathogen.  According to Luc Montagnier, who won a Nobel Prize for the discovery of AIDS, Covid-19 is spliced with elements of AIDS and Malaria, which could explain why anti-malarials are so effective in neutralizing early symptomatic cases.
https://www.ibtimes.sg/nobel-winning-scientist-who-co-discovered-hiv-claims-novel-coronavirus-was-made-wuhans-lab-43277</p>
<p>Note the "debunked" lab origin argument that has obviously been a complete lie since day 1.</p>
<p>Unambiguous science is correct- beyond a shadow of a doubt these treatments are safe and effective and thousands of doctors corroborate this.  All of these have been used for decades, including Ivermectin which just won its Japanese discoverer a Nobel Prize in 2015 for being a wonder-drug that can cure practically everything- it even reverses the chemotherapy-resistant properties cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth.  The only people saying it doesn't work are journalists who play doctors on TV and then admit on hidden cameras that they lie all the time about everything.</p>
<p>Here's the treatment protocol in depth.  If you get sick, use it.  Peter McCullough, the 57-year-old pioneer of the treatment protocol (with pre-existing conditions) used it on himself immediately upon getting Covid-19 and recovered in a few days.

        <p>I like data.  Here is a lot.</p>
<p>Ivermectin: 56 trials, 484 scientists, 18,447 patients
https://c19ivermectin.com/</p>
<p>HCQ: 246 trials, 3,947 scientists, 378,558 patients
https://c19hcq.com/</p>
<p>The NIH, CDC, and FDA do not recommend any early treatment.  Why?</p>
<p>Like I said, either a cult member or a bot, because the amount of data is staggering to anyone with any intellectual curiosity.  You can keep on believing everything else from the same people who swore Covid-19 was natural if you like.  But this "bombshell" was obvious 15 months ago.</p>

        <p>Thank you! My digging has convinced me to be much more skeptical of Vaccines. </p>
<p>Also I was even thinking that with all the panic about COVID combined with the low fatality rate you could make a placebo vaccine that does literally nothing and everyone would still line up for it just to feel safe.</p>

        <p>You can pretty much scour around CDC to find all the data surrounding this Vaccine. Take what you will but I think do a decent job providing what you need to know.</p>
<p>mRNA Vaccines imo are a great progression in the way of improved Vaccines. My issue currently is the lack of long term data (meaning: 5-10+ years). Fortunately for me, I happen to be within the range of least susceptibility of this virus so I have the luxury of waiting for the data. For people who don't have that luxury, this Vaccine is a major breakthrough.</p>
<p>Another issue, personal choice and responsibility. The hard push by Media and Government to take the Vaccine to the point they want you to provide paperwork proving you took it is weird and questionable. Either the Media and Government Officials don't understand how Vaccines work or they don't have faith it's effective as they want it to be. Either way, your doctor will know what's best for you and you have a right to a second opinion but you should be solely responsible for you own health decisions.</p>

        <p>I did say "take what you will". Don't hang on their every word. Some skepticism is required. Do your research and make your own decisions. Bottom line, your doctor would be the best person to know what's best for you. You have a right to a second opinion and I'll repeat this.

        <p>Here’s a question. Why would you take a rabies vaccine if there is no empirical evidence available that shows it does anything? Why not apply the same logic from the Covid vaccine to the rabies vaccine? What grand belief makes you unquestionably take the vaccine for rabies? It’s the same quasi-religious belief that is held by people taking the Covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>But who is “they”? I was VERY skeptical for months before I got my vaccine. No one called me anti-vaxx. All my peers and coworkers got it months ago, they never pushed me. They told me to make an informed decision for myself. That’s what I ended up doing after reading the EUA sheet, understanding what EUA means, and weighing the risks and rewards. My final assumption was the worst the vaccine could do is not be as effective as we want it to be. At no point during my personal process did ANYONE call me anti-vaxx. No one says that you must get the vaccine. It’s encouraged, yes. What you see on the media is conversations about its safety (and the reasons it is safe) and not “everyone must get it.” </p>
<p>People are entitled to their morals and views. I totally understand why someone would not want to get it. At one point I didn’t want to get it either. That doesn’t make me an anti-vaxxer nor does it make you one. </p>
<p>People need to stop watching the news. 🥴</p>
<p>I just urge you to be cautious in the language that you use.</p>

        <p>What, specifically, concerns you about the mRNA vaccines?  I’m a biochemist with an immunology background, and the science behind this now platform is incredibly comprehensive and the safety profile is excellent.  </p>
<p>Also curious about the therapies from 2020 that you said were effective, because we still don’t really have any, even a year past that.  Some mABs now, but they’re middling.  A novel STING agonist, but the timing on that has to be near perfect.  Not a lot yet, pharmacologically speaking.</p>

        <p>I think that I already had COVID 19 (waiting for antibodies test), but I also don’t really see my point in taking a vaccine for a virus that has 99.99% survival rate (for my specific age and health profile). No shame on anyone that wants it. From a moral standpoint this is better also so those that truly need it can get the vaccine earlier instead of me taking their spot.</p>

        <p>More fear without data.</p>
<p>If an argument is emotional, the position is flimsy.</p>
<p>What long-term effects are you talking about?  How long do people lose their sense of smell, what do severe residual Covid-19 symptoms look like after 1 year?  After 5 years?  How is this different from other similar pathogens?  This data does not exist.</p>
<p>And how about the vaccine?</p>
<p>Here's a fun study title: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine candidate significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 shedding in ferrets
https://www.nature.com/articles/s4u1541-021-00315-6</p>
<p>Sounds positive and promising, right?</p>
<p>And yet... HALF of the ferrets with the "prime-boost" therapy DIED AND WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE FINAL DATA.</p>
<p>"On day 56, during the challenge of prime-boost animals, acute unexpected reactions were observed in several animals, one of which was severe enough to warrant euthanasia. Affected ferrets showed varying degrees of respiratory distress, and necropsies were performed on euthanised animals. Histopathological assessment of respiratory tissues suggested an underlying allergic process."  Note how they shift from single pronoun to plural, and it turns out that two ferrets elicited a severe enough reaction to the challenge (reinfection) to EXCLUDE THEIR RESULTS.</p>
<p>This level of scientific integrity is akin to flipping a coin four times, getting tails twice, deciding that those were unexpected results, and only publishing the heads results with the title: Coin Flips Found to Overwhelmingly Favor Heads.</p>
<p>They give a flimsy response for why the 2 ferrets were healthy but somehow didn't have the fatal immune allergic reaction until AFTER the challenge and decide that the positive measurements from 2 surviving ferrets out of the original 4 ferret cohort (these sample sizes are a freaking joke) merit a glowing endorsement of the vaccine's properties.</p>
<p>THIS IS HOW SCIENCE IS BEING DONE TO SUPPORT VACCINES.</p>
<p>The Establishment has lied about literally everything for a year, many of which are hard facts you can verify for yourself, most recently in testimony to the Senate about funding gain-of-function research- which the conspiracy community all figured out 17 months ago.  Why on earth would you trust single thing they say?  Especially when the people driving the narrative opine for depopulation through vaccines and rub [insert body part here] with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>90% of the media is owned by 6 corporations, meaning it only takes orders from 6 CEOs to drive the entire global narrative.  147 companies control 40% of the world's economy and 4 indexing companies functionally control them.  How many people would it take to make this catastrophe happen?  Not nearly as many as you think.</p>

        <p>The left has weaponized science and data. They have created this scenario where only the science and data that fits the narrative is "credible".  They then bring in "fact checkers" that are part of the same cabal, that then "verify" the science and data.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of well credentialed people that have gone against the narrative from AIDS to man made global warming to Covid.  They are summarily dismissed and discredited. </p>
<p>Giving me bogus information, that is then confirmed by bogus fact checkers, isn't doing anyone any good.  In addition, censorship and banning of information, for example, deaths and side effects of this current (non) vaccine, further makes people resistant to believing the narrative.</p>

        <p>So what's the endgame here? The left gaining control over society through the government?</p>
<p>The left AND the right <em>already</em> control us, and they're all in it together (the highest-level politicians, anyway).</p>
<p>It's pretty simple, really. Left overreaches to mildly restrict freedoms, right becomes outraged, and voila, they have the perfect smokescreen in order to further dismantle the middle class and transfer more wealth to the richest politicians and corporations, while all of the commoners are distracted by pointless bullshit. </p>
<p>It kills me that some of you guys are just so close, but still don't get it.</p>

        <p>The people at the top are for themselves. They only use leftism now to accomplish state capitalism with their own oligarchs in control. They were on the right when that was convenient.</p>
<p>However, the propaganda today is leftist and that is the propaganda that needs to be address in order to shine a light on the actual agenda.</p>
<p>They WANT to cause a race war, they WANT to cause division, they WANT local LEOs and local governance gone, they WANT to control you and in 1980 that could be sold to Republicans but now they need the Leftists to sell it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And by the way "mildly restrict freedoms"??? Your definition of mild is nowhere near mine. We were under martial law sold as a quarantine which is the isolation of sick people, not the healthy.</p>

        <p>You're totally missing the point by thinking this is a left vs right thing, or that just leftists or leftism is responsible (and it's just what they want you to think, too). We're not talking about legitimacy of ideology here.</p>
<p>Wanting a "race war," wanting division, wanting control are not even remotely exclusive to politicians who publicly identify with leftism. They are tools of the evil, greedy authoritarians that run every major nation in the world. This is how they get in power, and this is how they stay there. If you don't think McConnel and Trump were out there purposefully sowing division in the same vein as Pelosi and Biden, then your head is buried way too far in the sand for your own good.</p>
<p>If the entire country was run by Republicans, we'd still have the same problems, because everyone at the top is always the same flavor of evil. </p>
<p>Every potential crisis (whether naturally occurring or manufactured; doesn't matter which one covid is) is just another opportunity for everyone at the top (left AND right) to take more and more from us. </p>
<p>But dude, yeah it was pretty mild. On a scale of 1 to China, how bad was it really? If you got upset by the quarantines and mask mandates, then you really got outraged by the wrong things.</p>

Trump actually said the exact opposite, but many lefties believe the “very fine people” bullshit to this day.</p>

        <p>Evidence presented by whom?  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, sure.  If I have zero knowledge on automobile engineering or mechanics, and my opinion is that cars actually run better on liquid nacho cheese, would it be wise for others to fill their tanks up at taco bell?</p>
<p>The evidence I tend to see is the near eradication of deadly diseases throughout the last 200 years or so vs just letting these things play out.  If everyone else is expendable to you and you view this just as a natural cleasing or have some mentality of breaking eggs to make an omelette, your opinion sort of makes sense.  </p>

<p>We can agree on this..  but you haven't even attempted to identify a cause for this.  You know what else has improved in the last 200 years?  Basic sanitation.  Regular people have access to the products necessary to fully clean and sanitize their homes and sewage systems are ubiquitous and effective.</p>
<p>&rt; Based on actual research performed by actual medical professionals with actual relevant educations</p>
<p>Which is fine..  but,  do they have any biases?  Was there something they missed?  How "complete" can any research actually be?  Having an expert opinion is great,  pretending there's no other valid sources of information is insane.</p>

        <p>Possibly, but is that always the case with people who’s family members catch covid and die?  It just seems like people want yo say things like “Covid is only 1-2% fatal” when those numbers are based on world wide or nation wide populations, but are very quick to condemn a vaccine due to and even smaller percentage of a much smaller number.</p>

        <p>My point was very much they are not the same though.  More specifically the risk of dying from one is significantly larger than dying from the other.  It would be like saying the risk of dying from a shark attack is exactly the same as the risk of a fish jumping out of the water into your mouth and choking to death.  Both are pretty unlikely to happen to an individual but one is significantly more likely still.  </p>
<p>For every million people vaccinated, 1-2 might experience a long term side effect.  So even if the entire population of the US was vaccinated, maybe 300-700 people would be worse off than not doing anything at all.  </p>
<p>Even with a solid portion of the country taking this pandemic seriously, masking up in public and doing little things like washing their hands more, actively attempting to mitigate sickness, over 500,000 people died in the US.  </p>
<p>If your argument is it only matters if it affects you personally so you see this as an equal risk as you only have personal relationships with less than 700 people, I don’t really know what to say.</p>

        <p>Millions of people die every day, it’s a fact of life. Get used to it. Restricting the free movement of the population of the entire planet is not a realistic solution to a virus that harms so few and kills even fewer. Is it sad that people are losing their families? Yes. Should I be expected to stay home for years on end to protect somebody who is already dying of multiple comorbidities? No.</p>

        <p>Anti-Vaxx, Conspiracy Theorist, Karen--These are the terms they use to shame people for doing research that they don't do. They listen to one side of "experts" but not the other. The other is always wrong, always bad, always hateful.</p>
<p>If it looks like a cult, talks like a cult, acts like a cult...it's a cult. They would need to be de-programmed at this point.  I mean these are the same people, primarily, that will allow a woman selling silicon toddler penises for those two year olds that are "traumatized" that they don't have one. </p>
<p>No one asks how this toddler can be traumatized by not having a penis if they've never seen one just like they don't ask why USA Today can print an article saying "So you might get Bells Palsy from the vaccine...what's a little facial nerve damage if it helps the local paranoid feel better at life"</p>

        <p>I downloaded and read the entire study series that the CDC used in 2003 to say that multiple infant vaccines were perfectly safe. Since you have done the same research, give me the background on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>did they test the vaccines on children?</li>
<li>if yes, how?</li>
<li>if not, why not?</li>
<li>from whom did they get the data to determine it was safe?</li>
<li>did the various data contributors use the same "criteria" or "medical code" responding to those conditions that would demonstrate an adverse event?</li>
<li>was it amalgamated?</li>
<li>what is an IRB and should it have board members from the same institutions supplying the data? Should it if the IRB member is a department chair over one of the researchers?</li>
<li>what was the acceptable numbers that the study determined were allowable for an Infant Death Report before a vaccine lot is pulled?</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If we've done the same research you should be able to answer those questions easily. I have more, by the way.</p>

No vaccine has ever been shown to be efficacious, diet and clean water are responsible for the drop in death, not vaccines or other medicines.

        <p>The way I think of it is similar. </p>
<p>I'm pro testing and verification. 
 I'm against doing something out of panic which is how I see the reaction to covid.</p>
<p>I'm against coercion which is how I see the government media propaganda. Telling me I'm allowed to act normal if I get this emergency use shot is plain coercion. </p>
<p>I've never had an issue with a vaccine because my family doctor has always been able to say yeah it's safe. I've had it myself and reactions are very rare.</p>

        <p>She didn't die though? Unless you're being sarcastic that was, what appears to be at least based on a 15 minute google search, a series of stories created from stories based on misinformation. A game of telephone started off with inaccurate information, essentially. Pretty informative articles though, very interesting read.</p>

        <p>Then you have the wrong person, someone made the page to further the spread of ignorant misinformation, or she died of complications from something else. The supposed death rate from the vaccine is miniscule, enough to be written it off as grasping at straws  and that person was going to die no matter what they decided.</p>

        <p>I’m a little confused. He makes two comparisons about getting thing A out of thing B where thing A is dangerous and thing B is good. Which thing is vaccines in his example: A or B? From the construction of his “not anti-thing B” structure it sounds like he’s trying to have something removed from vaccines?</p>

A lot of people here are very well-informed and we are constantly gaslit by people who have no interest in asking real questions and getting to the bottom of things.

        <p>It's not capitalism per se, it is however immoral capitalism.  Any system can and does get corrupt.  People cry out for socialism thinking there is going to be an equal distribution of things but most often the distribution goes to the top players and gov workers.</p>

        <p>There’s a vast difference between cronyism/corporatism, which is Mussolini’s definition of fascism (the merger of state and corporate powers), and free market capitalism. The former relies on state protectionism and exemptions. The latter relies on two or more consenting parties, voluntarily trading goods and services in exchange for a form of compensation.</p>
<p>Big pharma is an actual fascist industry.</p>

        <p>Medical education and research were taken over by the Rockefeller Syndicate snake oil salesmen over 100 years ago. They teamed with the crooks in the AMA to build a protection racket for their corrupt Pharma cartel. </p>
<p>Long before vaccines and antibiotics, infectious diseases had mostly faded away due to sanitation, hygiene and nutrition improvements. This would’ve been bad for business, so they mostly swapped autoimmune diseases and cancers for the old infectious diseases, creating evergreen disease “treatment” franchises. SV40 contaminated vaccines helped with this endeavor. They injected hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>&rt;“While science greatly extended the original nontechnological advances in agriculture, hygiene, and birth control, the contribution of medical science to the overall reduction in death rates and improved health was relatively quite small. ^1:220-221</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In the great majority of cases the toll of the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"The <strong>chief credit</strong> for the conquest of the destructive epidemics ... ought to have been given <strong>to the social reformers</strong> who had campaigned for purer water, better sewage disposal and improved living standards. <strong>It had been their efforts, rather than the achievement of the medical scientists, which had been chiefly responsible for the reduction in mortality from infectious disease"</strong>. ^2:12

<p>Dr. Richard Horton is the editor in chief of the world’s leading medical journal, The Lancet.  Writing in his own journal he states that <strong>medical science has</strong> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf">“taken a turn towards darkness.”</a></p>
<h2>Pharma: A History of Corruption</h2>
<p>&rt;”The Rockefeller Foundation pays the medical college pipers from the profits made by the Rockefeller Drug Trust and of course the Drug Trust calls the tune.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.”</p>
<p><strong>SV40 Debacle</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”...98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40—a monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.”</strong> ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”By 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses.“</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”As of 2003, SV40 had been found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that <strong>the rates of SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine</strong>, including the UK, USA, and Italy.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html">Goldman Sachs asks in biotech research report: ‘Is curing patients a sustainable business model?’</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE ROCKEFELLERS</strong></p>
<p>&rt;The merchants-in-medicine, organized in the A.M.A., found allies in their fellow merchants in industry at the beginning of this century. <strong>It is peculiarly fitting that the agency that enabled them to monopolize the field of medicine and its education should be the General Education Board, an outgrowth of Doc William Rockefeller’s quack cancer cure and medicine show.”</strong> (5:93)</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Up to 90% of the total decline in the death rate of children between 1860-1965</strong> because of whooping cough, scarlet fever, diptheria, and measles <strong>occurred before the introduction of immunisations and antibiotics."</strong> ^6
&rt;<em>-Dr. Archie Kalokerinos, M.D.</em></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Much of what you have been led to believe about immunizations simply isn't true.”</strong> ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”If immunizations were responsible for the diminishing or disappearance of these diseases in the United States, <strong>one must ask why they disappeared simultaneously in Europe, where mass immunizations did not take place.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”With the polio vaccine we are witnessing a rerun of the medical reluctance to abandon the smallpox vaccination, which remained as the only source of smallpox-related deaths for three decades after the disease had disappeared.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”For thirty years kids died from smallpox vaccinations even though no longer threatened by the disease.”</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/obituaries/rene-dubos-scientist-and-writer-dead.html">“Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</a> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>” ^1:220</p>
<p>&rt;”Professor <strong>Dubos has further stated:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Modern Science’s role in defeating infectious diseases has been greatly exaggerated.</strong> Many of the most terrifying leprosy, plague, typhus, - had all but <strong>disappeared</strong> from Europe <strong>before serums, vaccines, and drugs</strong> were developed to combat them". ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“Many so-called "medical discoveries",</strong> however, have been <strong>announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^8</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported</strong> on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that <strong>microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination.</strong> One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J.,</strong> who stressed that <strong>‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases</strong> including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease <strong>and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^9</p>
<p>&rt;##“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals</strong> pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the <strong>present measures used</strong> to check contagious diseases <strong>may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments</strong> used to check diseases, <strong>he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate</strong> that America may become a nation of invalids. <strong>Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young."</strong> (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^10</p>
<p>&rt;”I read what prominent men of science, medical officers for health, and doctors wrote about vaccination and its sequelae that never made it into today’s textbooks, and found out what anyone with even a passing acquaintance with disease figures of the 19th and 20th century knew. For example, by the 1950s when the whooping cough vaccine was introduced, data showed that whooping cough was killing only 1 percent of the numbers of people who used to die in England and Wales 50 years before. ^11</p>
<p>&rt;Official data showed that the same happened with measles.”</p>

        <p>it IS a fantastic post - - - but my only question is - was any of this done ON PURPOSE.<br>
take the SV40 problem.  was that done on purpose or was it human error?  <br>
of course science needs money for research - to end pain and suffering some money needs to be spent - and many times rich people, something rich, gov't investment, etc. gives/spends money to investigate/help find a cure of some disease, problem, plague hurting human beings.  but - everyone knows - HUMAN BEINGS MAKE MISTAKES.  Even fancy dancy human beings like the Queen, the Pope, the Trump, the President (whoever it may be at the time), the Scientists - everyone on this green earth - black/white/red/yellow/europeans/americans/asians/christians/muslims/atheists/old people/young people, etc., etc. - MAKE MISTAKES.<br>
Though, it is also true - some mistakes after they are found/discovered are actually propagated further, or are not publicized or even lied about - usually cause of GREED (which in a sense is another human failing).  <br>
but - i don't know - for me - to think, believe everything is because of some sinister plot purposely done to kill/control/inflict injury to people for no particular reason - i just can't - won't - believe in such a world that obviously would be controlled/run by hate.<br>
i can live in a world run by ignorance, stupidity, innocent mistakes, fouled up premises, wrong conclusions, messed up statistics, overlooked conclusions - but NOT by PURPOSEFUL HATE.  </p>
<p>&amp; THAT is why i'm not a conservative, nor a 3Ner, nor a conspiracy follower nor in any of those believers who need hate to thrive on - whether it be a world they believe is real or in a world they created.</p>

        <p>Wow that’s a lot to go through. I’m sorry but infectious diseases hadn’t gone away due to sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition. Look at the data showing when a vaccine was started and the decline of cases. I can provide if you can’t find it. </p>
<p>Smallpox didn’t decline from that. A vaccine did it. As for the rest of the post, I’m not going to even entertain it. You clearly believe in some weird conspiracy about medicine. I hope that if you ever need to take any medicine, that you thank the snake oil salesman that came up with it.</p>

        <p>There is. Respiratory viruses like flu and COVID spread better in cold air. Less moisture. And I’m not sure at the rate of infection last year to this year. Comparing would be difficult due to vaccine, current population infected, variants, etc.</p>

        <p>Polio vaccine was introduced in the early 1950s. What hygiene or sanitation changes happened then?

<p>Hepatitis a vaccine was introduced in 1995 in the US. What hygiene or sanitary changes occurred then?

<p>Both of these examples of diseases that are transmitted fecal oral route. I challenge you to find what caused a decline incases other than vaccines. </p>
<p>As far as how, vaccines prevent infection/spread of a disease. If it’s not transmitted, less people get it. That’s how it works. Need more examples?</p>

        <p>Sorry I didn’t understand what you wanted. The original post was very antivax in general. </p>
<p>The first study showed the effectiveness at preventing hospitalization and death. 
<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.21.21255873v1">91,000 people post vaccine study</a>
 Again another study showing effectiveness of the vaccines from Israel. 
<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext">Israel’s effective study </a></p>
<p>The cdc has listed over 30 studies globally showing effectiveness at preventing severe disease, preventing asymptotic infection, and preventing spread if you get COVID post vaccine. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html#ref32">Cdc studies </a></p>
<p>What do you want to know? You aren’t asking any questions. I can go on and on showing you large study after large study showing the effectiveness.</p>

        <p>Sorry I misunderstood since you didn’t say that anywhere. I’m not sure that data is available. You’re talking about a lot of confounding variables. I’m not sure you could see a study showing the flu vaccine efficacy vs seasonal weather let alone COVID. I think you’d need at least a year or two of data but I’m not 100% sure.</p>
<p>If it’s not available, does that mean the vaccines don’t work?  Like the only way to prove the vaccines work is to show decline in cases and prove it’s not El Niño causing the changes?</p>

        <p>Oh dear no need to be personal. </p>
<p>&rt;In the 17th century soap makers were given special privileges and soap industry started to develop rapidly</p>
<p>So you are saying that solely because the soap industry developed rapidly, various diseases (no matter whether they spread through body contact, air or body fluids) were defeated because everyone, (no matter whether they were nobility or extremely poor peasants) was buying soap and was washing their hands with clean water...?</p>

<p>It is quite obvious why I did that, I'm shocked you do not understand that. 
When someone builds the foundation of their thesis on information that turns out to be factually wrong, you don't need to dissect every part of their claim. As soon as the basis is wrong, everything that was concluded by using the false info loses credibility anyways.</p>
<p>But you want me to ignore that because it was a long comment and I need to answer with a long comment or else it seems foolish to you...?</p>

        <p>It wasn't because what you said sounded intelligent. It was because you were clearly creating strawmen and debating them instead of engaging with the poster and their actual argument. Further, you weren't even intelligent enough to disguise the strawman to draw a debate out of the poster.

        <p>One Person claimed that:</p>
<p>"Long before vaccines and antibiotics, infectious diseases had mostly faded away due to sanitation, hygiene and nutrition improvements."</p>
<p>To which I commented:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, did you sleep through every history class you ever sat in?</p>
<p>&rt;Long before vaccines and antibiotics, infectious diseases had mostly faded away due to sanitation, hygiene and nutrition improvements&lt;</p>
<p>Are you actually trying to say that people lived in a healthy and sanitary way in the 17th century???
Whattt??"</p>
<p>The second commenter then said:</p>
<p>"In the 17th century soap makers were given special privileges and soap industry started to develop rapidly. [...]"</p>
<p>The first comment said that hygiene and nutrition improved and therefore the people became healthier, despite antibiotics and vaccinations not being available yet. I questioned this claim. I then got an answer which told me that the soap business grew.
Now there are two options to interpret why this was commented. Either, this person commented this to defend the first commenter, or, this person commented this totally out of context. </p>
<p>I believe the ladder is less likely that's why I went with the first option.
The person commented that soap business boomed as an answer to my comment, questioning whether the 17th century had hygiene.
What I then did was not a strawman, I challenged their claim. It goes something like this:
If I put your statement into context of the comment thread, it would mean that you believe that the booming soap business was the reason for people being more healthy than before. To which I then said that this would also include diseases spread over air or body fluids to show them that their claim contradicts itself since the first commenter never specified that they were only talking about diseases that are spread by hands.</p>
<p>It's not a strawman if I show you the widespread consequences of one claim...</p>
<p>And of course I know it wasn't meant as a compliment. Doesn't mean I can't take it as one tho :)</p>

        <p>You misunderstood the point. I cited E. Richard Brown, Rene Dubos, Brian Inglis and others that stated that 19th century diseases were vanquished by improvements in sanitation, hygiene and nutrition long before vaccines/therapies etc.</p>

        <p>Well the problem with that is... vaccines have been around since 1717 or even earlier. That's why your claim contradicts itself. 
You said there were improvements in sanitation, hygiene and nutrition long before vaccines. Long before vaccines means something like 100 or at least 50 years prior to the invention of vaccines. Vaccines were invented in the 18th century(or even earlier). That would mean that you claim that there was this improvement somewhere in the 1650s or something.
So why would these 19th century quotes prove anything about an issue in the 17th century?</p>

        <p>Except we literally don’t know the long term safety data of this vaccine because the data doesn’t exist. </p>
<p>Except in previous studies of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02991/full">mRNA</a>  therapy, all the animals receiving the vaccine, when exposed to the wild type virus, developed auto immune disorders and died. </p>

        <p>Great ADE is interesting. So some viruses like Zika, HIV, dengue fever, SARS and MERS have had issue with vaccine development. After getting the vaccine, an exposure to the virus doesn’t cause neutralization by antibodies. Instead, macrophages and other innate immune cells take up the virus and spread it. Kind of like protective cover. This can lead to increased infection severity. Several animalistic coronavirus vaccines have failed. This led to the animals death. Hence where the concern originated. </p>
<p>Now let’s look at the COVID vaccines. They knew this could be an issue so they tested for it. Part of it is antibody levels, part of study design. They didn’t find it. If you had ADE, there would be more cases of COVID in the vaccine group and severity would hav even increased. The opposite was true. The link above that you posted goes into more detail but that’s the 10sec version since it doesn’t seem like you read it. Would you like to know more?</p>

        <p>In the middle. Vaccination with SARS COV protein spikes, recombinant DNA (maybe more relevant to J&amp;J and AZ in this case)   vaccination with SARS COV protein. Obviously mRNA isn’t a protein, but it makes a protein—just like the protein that was injected into these animals. No indication that long term risks will be any different than in this table.

        <p>Cool so you’re the one claiming it’s safe so the onus of proof is on you. But you can’t prove it as it’s not available. Oh, what a catch-22. </p>
<p>People have not died—I mean people have died, but not before the EUA, just look at OPEN VAERS (and that is HEAVILY underreported)—because this is first time mRNA had been used on people and long term safety data is not available. Based on the animal studies for previous SARS COV vaccines, however, a lot of the vaccinated animals became very sick and died, even if they had initially strong antibody responses from the vaccine...when they came across the wild type virus, they developed auto immune disorders within weeks to months. There is no indication this has changed with the vaccine as we only have the initial antibody response, but not data from wild virus exposure. </p>

        <p>I’m not providing any data or claim. The research has shown it. Large studies. Lots of people involved. Would you like to read them?  The studies you listed were for SARS and MERS. What do you think they mean and how do they apply?</p>
<p>Open vaers is a waste of time to look at. I’m not going to have the relevant data to run any statistics. For example, rotoshield in the US was pulled form market because 1-2/10,000 children developed intestinal blockage beyond the 1/10,000 that’s normally seen. If 100 people normally get a heart attack in a given time, and 101 people get a heart attack and of those 50 people have gotten the vaccine, did the vaccine cause an increase in heart attacks?  No. The data doesn’t support. </p>
<p>What long term safety do you want ?  How long?  What’s normal?  </p>
<p>They knew about the concern about ADE. They specially looked at it. They didn’t find any when testing animals or humans. If it did occur, people who got vaccinated would have worse symptoms compared to placebo if they got COVID. That doesn’t happen. </p>
<p>I get the busy life. If you read this, please take this one thing away.  You don’t know what you’re talking about. You don’t have the background and education. Read and listen you what actual experts are saying and not Reddit or random videos online. I have a degree in biology and doctorate in the medical field. I am not an expert but I can tell when someone thinks they know more than they actually do.</p>

        <p>Actually it’s we’ve looked at the data (bc anyone w a basic reading comprehension can do that) and determined our own ideas around it rather then letting the tv tell us what to think. 
Unfortunately for you guys and the big pharma trolls, people who don’t want this vax also don’t give a single F about what you guys think.

<p>You won’t be able to because it didn’t happen. It would be like saying a vaccine killed all the animals in testing a vaccine for the bubonic plague so we can’t take a flu shot. It’s completely different. </p>

        <p>Except "conspiracy theorists" are trying to shine the light on this and inform everyone so everyone knows the truth. They dont want to alone know the truth. Your arguement just collapsed. </p>
<p>I talked to someone who would refuse to see the obvious truth of what is happening and when I finally gave him too much evidence to deny he said "I just can't live in a world where that is true" you see, so its denial.

        <p>Wow. Lots to unpack. So i am a scientist so let’s break it down together. Side effects from vaccines are typically seen within 16 weeks. Long term complications are usually limited to autoimmune issue. Which could occur from the disease itself self so no increased risk from vaccine. If I’m missing long term issues with vaccines, please share. </p>
<p>True we’ve not developed mRNA vaccines in past. We’ve been working on it for. 40 years. Also there’s 8 vaccines used globally. 2 are mRNA. </p>
<p>They’re not in phase 1-3. Phase 3 was completed. Technically in phase 4 but all drugs and vaccines are always in phase 4 after approval. That’s to look for adverse reactions. </p>
<p>I’m not sure about the propaganda/lies you refer to so I’ll skip over that. </p>
<p>It’s not nearly 100%. You’re dismissing a large amount of death and suffering. Besides actual death, long term complications from the disease can persist. </p>
<p>It doesn’t violate the Nuremberg code. There isn’t going to be a trial. Look at the ICC website schedule to confirm if you’d like. </p>
<p>Would you like to know more?</p>

<p>The CDC also says that the survival rate of covid is 99.97%., and only 5% of deaths recorded were caused by covid. The other 95% of deaths were patients with pre-existing conditions that caused their deaths. Hence healthy people have nothing to worry about. </p>
<p>The CDC is also switching to running PCR tests on &lt;28 cycles on injected people while only counting them as cases if they are hospitalised or die?</p>
<p>Meanwhile the uninjected will continue to have their PCR tests run on 35+ cycles, which are so innacurate the accuracy is basically 0%. You can get a positive test for COVID-19 if the test detects an antibody for a common cold at that point.</p>
<p>So what's the conspiracy theory? That they will announce that the drop in cases is proof that the injections work?</p>
<p>Swine Flu vaccine caused narcolepsy and cataplexy, Tamiflu Vaccine outright killed a bunch of people and let’s not get in to the fact that the Bill and Melinda gates foundation has ravaged populations across Africa including the near complete sterilisation of an entire community... Oh and let’s not forget that J&amp;J have the prestigious honour of paying out the single largest compensation payout in pharmaceutical history, or that Pfizer or Moderna (I’m not sure which one exactly) has the largest amount of legal complaints and convictions against them. As a little caveat for you as well, remember the Swine Flu vaccine? Yeah the government gave the manufacturers legal immunity then too, but guess what? The government still ended up paying out £60m in compensation to those negatively affected by it.</p>
<p>But by all means let them shoot you up with whatever experimental unapproved “vaccines” that you want, just don’t come to me and bitch because I don’t want to “trust the science” and “listen to the experts“... these companies don’t give a fuck about you, or your family, or the world as a whole... the only thing they care about is profit!</p>

        <p>Yes having other conditions increase the risk of death. Yes healthily people have a higher chance of surviving. </p>
<p>If you want to talk about PCR, explain the difference between rt-PCR, qPCR, and hot start PCR without looking it up. Otherwise you are parroting what you read online and don’t really have an understanding. The h1n1 didn’t show any correlation to narcolepsy except for one study out of Sweden?  </p>
<p>Tamiflu isn’t a vaccine. It’s used to treat influenza a. 
In the US vaccines have legal immunity until you go to vaccine court first. </p>
<p>I don’t think they care about me or anyone else. I think they care about money. I think the vaccines they’ve made work based on the data and large studies. I could care less if they make a billion off of it.</p>

        <p>One study in Sweden? Vaccine court? I’m not sure what you’re trying to get at but my point is the vaccine is not the golden ticket back to normal. Covid is not the black plaque and In the span of one year during these ridiculous lockdowns that were supposed to save lives and slow the spread we’ve seen..... Police brutality; deaths from vaccines; lockdown side effects including but not limited to suicide, delayed cancer treatment, substance abuse, domestic violence, depression, and dehumanization; the destruction of livelihoods and global supply chains; censorship; corporate consolidation and conflicts of interest.  All that shit happened....... in one year.</p>

        <p>Sweden had a study showing increased narcolepsy post H1N1 vaccine. All other studies showed no relation. The cdc concluded no link found. Keep in mind, the US never approved the the vaccine. We looked into it from a public health standpoint. </p>
<p>Vaccine court is where you send a case for vaccine injury. It’s part of vaccine injury compensation program started in the 1980s in the US. It also started VAERS. You have to go to that court before you can sue a vaccine company for injury. People talk about not being able to sue COVID vaccine makers but you actually have different recourse due to the PREP act. </p>

        <p>I understand you’re trying to have a “gotcha” moment here but you’re cherry picking specific arguments while completely ignoring others. It’s clear my answers don’t conform to your world views, yet you being a man of science I find it questionable that you would trust the Big Pharma industries who have been known to lie before. </p>
<p>There is a no liability clause with all these covid vaccines, hence vaccine court is out of the question. The amount of side effects aren’t even known yet because we haven’t had enough time to study them since they been rolled out, that’s no fault of science. </p>
<p>I suggest you do more due diligence and be open to other views. Cheers</p>

        <p>The idea that it is a conspiracy theory to believe that for-profit medicine attempts to make as much of a profit as possible off perpetually sick, injured, and weak people is ridiculous.</p>
<p>That scenario is the natural development of having a healthcare system whose primary purpose is making money as opposed to helping people. Why would they want there to be a healthy population that does not require their products and services?</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: is it a "conspiracy theory" to insist that Big Pharma has colluded (and still colludes) with doctors, scientists, and regulators in order to ensure that their dangerous products were pushed onto innocent people who had no concept of the risk they were taking?</p>
<p>For more reading, here is a post of mine where I went into great detail about the exact ways in which Big Pharma did just that during the Opioid Epidemic. Don't take my word for it, though - read the credible sources in this post, as well.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n8j9dq/the_opioid_epidemic_caused_by_big_pharma_never/</p>
<p>There is a mountain of incontrovertible evidence that indicates that this "conspiracy theory" was no theory, just conspiracy. These companies intentionally colluded with institutions that were supposed to protect us in order to pump their poison throughout the poorest parts of our country, causing untold suffering.</p>
<p>Of course, if you happen to somehow be more knowledgeable about the matter than the US Department of Justice, as well as several state Attorneys General, I would like to hear what you have to say on the matter. </p>
<p>And if you still trust Big Pharma, the regulatory institutions that work with it (despite there being a revolving door of Pharma execs becoming regulators and vice versa,) and the scientists that rely on funding from these companies to conduct research, I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p>Would they collude with scientists/regulatory institutions, manipulate data, and get doctors to recommend their products without informing patients of the true risk from COVID vaccines/treatments? </p>
<p>Maybe. They've done it before with other products/services. I think the better question is "why wouldn't they do all of those things now? What changed in the past year, that suddenly made Big Pharma trustworthy, ethical, and not profit-driven?"</p>
<p>Given how much of the world wants to/is required to get vaccinated, and how many people would be willing to take a treatment for the disease, the capacity for widespread harm is definitely there. We must be cautious.</p>
<p>Am I anti-vax? Not necessarily. But the only rational position one can take with regards to trusting the healthcare industry and the institutions that regulate it is skepticism, given the highly-unethical history of both parties here.</p>
<p>And my friend - Dunning-Kruger in this situation would be maintaining the belief that you somehow know more about the ethics and trustworthiness of the companies that harm you and the institutions that failed you than the professionals who investigate and prosecute them for doing just that.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying there’s not issues in medicine.  Large amounts of money cause issues. But science is science. Have different labs run the tests and see what comes out. Same data?  Seems like a logical conclusion. Different data?  Need to investigate more. </p>
<p>If you want to have a conversation about all the issues about the medical field we can. I’m familiar with a lot of the major issues and cases. That doesn’t take away from my point.  People think they know more or the science being discussed. They think they are experts in the field because they read a few blog posts. </p>
<p>I literally have an advanced degree in this. I don’t tout myself as an expert or know all the facts. I read what the experts write and the data they show. </p>
<p>Feel free to not trust any medicine or vaccine. Don’t trust “big bee” or “big milk” or “big diamonds” or whatever else. The fact remains is that unless you have evidence showing increased harm, it’s a conspiracy theory. Unless you show this exact level of distrust when you break a leg, have a heart attack, or need an over the counter pain reliever? Or is the medicine being practiced there safe for you?  If it is, it’s hypocrisy. If not, you don’t take advantage of the last 200 years of progress.</p>

        <p>Bullshit! If any of you guys were pro-vax, under the prerequisit of good safety data, then you`d all be vaccinated by now. There is an extensive amount of publicly available research data, that should ease the mind of even the biggest skeptic. Being called anti-vax under these circumstances is entirely on you.</p>

        <p>There have been 180.000 adverse events, that are not necessarily associated with the vaccine. Considering, that millions of uk residents got this vaccine, I`d say this outcome is acceptable. Keep in mind, that an activation of your immune system is necessary for the vaccine to work. Things like a headache, or sluggishness are therefore nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

But even if that number was larger, there should still be absolutely no doubt about the net benefit of protecting the vulnerable population trough vaccination.</p>

        <p>Equally undercounting makes governments look bad as it makes their draconian measures look even more unjustified</p>
<p>For instance, the UK is currently not suffering from covid in any remotely significant capacity. Therefore, the media started massively hyping up India to try to keep lockdowns going/justified</p>

        <p>“A report of a suspected ADR to the Yellow Card scheme does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the vaccine, only that the reporter has a suspicion
it may have. Underlying or previously undiagnosed illness unrelated to vaccination
can also be factors in such reports. The relative number and nature of reports should therefore not be used to compare the safety of the different vaccines.
All reports are kept under continual review in order to identify possible new risks.”</p>
<p>That means it’s a report of all reported things that happened after a vaccine, not that the vaccine caused it. </p>
<p>Please provide and data showing an increase in whichever side effects type comparing normal fats versus vaccinated population increased. For instance that showed 15 cases of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). If normally in that time 100 people get a heart attack, and during this time 101 people had a heart attack but 15 had gotten the vaccine, the vaccine didn’t cause those heart attacks. </p>

        <p>First news report “At the end of it, I could walk a good 15 minutes, which doesn't seem a lot for a lot of people but it was a big thing.”  So a program that has allowed her to walk 15min. Seems like the disease causes some issues?  </p>
<p>Great so the vaccine can help maybe 50% with long COVID. The UK estimates 1.1 million living with long COVID. Again, seem like a problem. </p>
<p>Both aren’t magic. Neither gives a large percentage of the people dealing with the issue relief. I don’t even understand the point you are trying to make.</p>

        <p>My point is that "long covid" is mostly just anxiety and general unhealthiness, since vaccination shouldn't have any effect on a previous infection (generally speaking). Exercise likewise alleviates both anxiety and unhealthiness.</p>

        <p>So you see it as you’re either pro- or anti- vax. Like, where is the nuance of opinion? You don’t have it, so you assume vaccine hesitant individuals don’t either and must be heavily polarized on one side or the other. Do you see how silly that stance is?</p>

        <p>If you were even the least bit coherent you would know this injection does not fit the definition of a vaccine.
It was rushed through and only minimally tested on a tight control group.
Just because the TV says there is extensive test data doesn’t make it so.
People like you are the extensive testing lab rats.</p>

        <p>It was tested on over 21000 peple, with another 21000 getting a placebo. Show me any other clinical trial with that many participants.
