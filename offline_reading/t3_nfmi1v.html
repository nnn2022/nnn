        <p>Here's one anecdotal aspect I've dealt with:</p>
<p>My family filed a wrongful death lawsuit for which mediation was scheduled to happen last summer. Depositions were last february... </p>
<p>"Pandemic" hit, mediations got reschedule <strong>thrice</strong>, and the last time, the just said they were postponing it indefinitely.</p>
<p>So these multinational corporations who fucking killed my dad are getting off with not paying out because of all this.</p>
<p>Now, by the time it DOES happen, money's going to be absolutely fucking worthless anyway, so whoopee.</p>
<p>I also lost my job last year, and unemployment strangely didn't go through for me. </p>
<p>Pretty much all financial security <em>and</em> hope for the future I had was swiped out from under me in one fell swoop. Now I'm broke and fucking hungry all the time.</p>
<p>Some people better fucking pay when all is said and done.</p>
