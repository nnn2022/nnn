    <strong>To all Anti-Vaxxors out there.</strong>
    <p><p>To say vaccines are ineffective or dangerous is to discredit the knowledge and advice of every medical professional including but not limited to doctors, medical researchers, nurses (RN and NP), medical students, medical institutions, universities, and colleges. In the US alone there are 535,600 active practitioners, this figure does not include all the items listed above and their personnel, as well as retired practitioners. But that is the US alone, there are an estimated 9.2 million active practitioners across the world in 195 different countries. To believe that vaccines are ineffective or dangerous would imply that in these 195 different governments, different medical practices, and different medical institutions, all of them have collectively agreed to keep the secret of vaccines being ineffective or dangerous to the rest of the world, and instead actively seek to keep this information a secret and continue to distribute vaccines to the general public. To believe that vaccines are ineffective or dangerous is to discredit the end of every major pandemic since 1796. To believe that vaccines are ineffective or dangerous shows complete disregard to the fact that smallpox, and rinderpest have both been completely wiped out (apart from lab testing of course), as well as polio with less than 500 new cases every year and no cases in first world countries. Please remember that if you believe that vaccines are ineffective or dangerous, that is not a sign of stupidity. Rather proof that you have done your own research, but as any researcher would tell you, it is extremely important to constantly logic check everything you read. Remember to think: does this make sense, does this hold up scientifically, has this paper been peer reviewed, what qualifies this person to say this and that. And that is why I’m not telling you what to think, rather pointing out some flaws that I have found in the whole Anti-Vaxx fiasco. Please stay safe, consider wearing a mask, and please truly judge the content you listen to, or where you get research from. Stay safe :)</p>

        <p>Trust in vaccines lay on the fact that they are usually developed over a period of <em>decades.</em></p>
<p>We’ve had 4 vaccines introduced in the span of a year or less. So either they were developed before the alleged ‘pandemic’, or they rushed it and that, rightfully so, prompts hesitancy and resistance.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that, I’m a 21 year old male, in near perfect health. I rarely get sick on a yearly basis. Can you explain to me why exactly I should get a ‘vaccine’ to ‘protect others’, when others are being vaccinated to allegedly ‘protect’ them from the virus? </p>
<p>Also, I think you should stop watching mainstream news. Covid-19 is the flu bud.</p>

        <p>You are correct! Vaccines have been developed over a course of decades and that is extremely lucky! If the medical and scientific communities didn't put any research into vaccines the covid vaccine would not have come out for an estimated time (from what I've heard) around 5-7 years! That's 5-7 more years of lockdown! Crazy!</p>
<p>*Edit*</p>
<p>I don't watch the news too too much but rather from time to time and from trusted sources!</p>

        <p>Right, not untested in animals. The rna vaccines that have been tested killed all the animals in the trials.</p>
<p>It is, however, untested in humans. This is not a flu shot my friend, so don’t conflate the two. These aren’t ‘vaccines’ at all.</p>

        <p>Right, I would agree. That’s not how science works. None of the pandemic measures have been ‘scientific’. Hopefully you start to wake up and realize that. It’s not scientific to quarantine healthy people, nor force them to wear masks. That’s idiotic. So is pushing a vaccine on those same, healthy individuals.</p>
<p>Edit: also, you don’t know that, so don’t make that claim. Money talks, not science, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>We're 16 months into a GlObAl PaNdEmIc and we still have to deal with people who appeal to authority and blindly follow the eXpErTz without any independent research. I really thought that the C19 debacle would make people question absolutely everything that they have ever believed about sEtTlEd ScIeNz^(TM). You clearly have not done any independent research which is why you say "smallpox, and rinderpest have both been completely wiped out" with a straight face knowing that these are the only diseases in human history that have been allegedly wiped out despite the lower level of technological advancement and global reach in the past. How was this feat possible? </p>

<p>TLDR: Squirrel monkeys dosed intranasally with thimerosal or saline for 6 consecutive days. Compared to saline group, mercury concentrations in the Thimerosal group were significantly raised in the brain, liver, muscle, and kidney. Conclusion - “accumulation of mercury from chronic use of thiomersal-preserved medicines is viewed as a potential health hazard for man.”</p>

<p>TLDR: Rat pups given either Thimerosal or inorganic mercury three times in their first 11 days of life, mimicking human infant vaccination schedules. The scientists then assessed the total retention of mercury and excretion over six days. The Thimerosal-exposed rats showed higher mercury retention rates in their brains, in line with some other results described in this chapter. Furthermore, these Thimerosal-exposed rats exhibited similar faecal excretion and much lower urinary excretion compared to the inorganic mercury-exposed rats. That second group also demonstrated higher retention rates of mercury in organs other than the brain.</p>

        <p>Have you considered for even a second that your hubris might be blinding you? Yes, you understand how vaccines work on a simple level. congratulations. You are at least average intelligence. </p>
<p>Now consider that there are levels of complexity in all fields of science that go far beyond what you can teach on a high school level. And consider as well that you are possibly conflating people who are anti-lockdown with anti-vaxxers. I personally don't have anything against vaccines, but given the nature of anti-viral vaccines I have little hope that they will eliminate the pandemic totally even if everyone took them. And considering the mass hysteria that's been going on, that means we will be in a state of facism-like lockdowns for the rest of our lives if we let it continue.</p>
<p>I would much rather live in a world of anti-vaxxers where covid is prevalent but my civil liberties where respected, than a world where covid is under control but my civil liberties are in the trash</p>

        <p>This post wasn't meant for you then, but that's ok! :) </p>
<p>The whole point of a lock-down is to prevent people from dying do to covid because life is a blessing so why risk such an amazing thing? If herd immunity is reached then their are no reasons to remain in lockdown, I hate lockdown and so does everything else. But I have a duty to keep myself and those around me safe to the best of my abilities. </p>
<p>And to say " I would much rather live in a world of anti-vaxxers where covid is prevalent but my civil liberties where respected, than a world where covid is under control but my civil liberties are in the trash" is terrible. You would rather have people possible die (and a lot will look at the US) than to give up a none of your liberties and put on a mask and stand 6 feet apart, that is extremely selfish. </p>
<p>Also what liberties are you giving up?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately you can still get covid after getting covid, especially with all the variants going around. Not to mention the chance of mutation when getting covid. Even if its as rare as winning the lottery, people still win it, so why take the chance it may be unlikely but its still a possibility. Like gun owners owning a gun for the sake of the very unlikely event of a home invasion. But when a home invasion does happen you're strapped and ready.</p>

        <p>That is correct! But when vaccinated your chances or developing severe symptoms are drastically reduced, you probably just get a runny nose, maybe a cough and after two weeks or so, good as new!</p>

        <p>I haven't done much research in regards to long term affects because I do trust both my lovely government and that of medical professions who have done more research in a lifetime than I'll ever know or understand, but that is why this post wasn't titled "The long term effects of vaccines!"

        <p>&rt;And being anti covid vaccine is the same as being an anti-vaxxor as you are against vaccinations of the general public. </p>
<p>That makes no sense. Do you think vegetarians are "anti-food" because they don't think people should eat a specific category of food? Same logic.</p>

        <p>It's very generous of you to reach to people that <a href="https://tinyimg.io/i/6YYOTyl.PNG">in your own words</a>, you hate.</p>
<p>What you are doing is dishonest though so I can see why the other moderator removed your post.  Nobody is debating vaccination in general and I'm sure you know this but it's much easier for people like you who aren't capable or willing of critical analysis to just pass on whatever narrative has disseminated from Fauci, Psaki or maybe just what you find on Reddit.</p>
<p>So, let's just agree that vaccines are an important tool in public health policy and hastypically benefitted humanity.  Dismissing concerns for people to take something that is only on the market because of emergency approval is either ignorant, reckless or something worse.   With the FDA approval process "the full research, development and approval process can last from 12 to 15 years." (<a href="https://www.drugs.com/fda-approval-process.html">https://www.drugs.com/fda-approval-process.html</a>)</p>
<p>While that seems even longer than I would expect, I have followed a trail series for a drug and it can take so long for so many reasons that cause major setbacks because the most important thing for medicine is to not harm the patient.  The blood clottting issue sounds like something that would have been a huge setback for the trial but fortunately the test subjects are typically made aware of the risks and often compensated monetarily.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how are able to dismiss the seriousness of the temporary recall of these brand new drugs that were rushed to the market that have only taken less than two months on the market to find.  Yet you still have the nerve to come here and condescendingly explain vaccination as a general concept to us like we are 5 year olds.</p>
<p>Be best, bro.  This ain't it.</p>

        <p>Wow I got the mods involved I’m a major threat to this subreddit, I’ll let bygones be bygones and I’ll let you all not vaccinate.</p>
<p>I am clearly out matched in this battle of “research” lol so I yield. And I see how compassionate this sub is to defunding their beliefs, good on you! </p>
<p>If you take anything away from me and my post please take this away!!!!!!! LOGIC CHECK! Please reread the last few lines of my rant, and do everything I suggested on a day to day level, hell use it in your war against vaccines! </p>
<p>But sense it’s been made clear by my dearest “coolcewlew” that my use of numbers and a little medical history and telling people to do logic checks when researching as ruined so many of your days. I shall never return to this sub Reddit! </p>
<p>Remember to stay safe! And I hope you all live a very happy and a very long life! :)</p>
