        <p>I believe this. I also believe that countries like Australia and NZ who parade around their “zero covid” countries by showing off how normal life is for them has helped overplay it. They aren’t wearing masks or ultimately being locked down. Everywhere in Australia except Victoria is living literally normally with concerts and office work and no masks and sporting events. You can’t parade that out as someone’s end game and then say it’s not everyone’s end game. You just can’t. It doesn’t work with humans. I really didn’t expect that from them but it’s true enough. If the globalists were really succeeding and getting their hands into shit, that would just not be happening.</p>

        <p>I think a key aspect to enlightening people given global discrepancies is to not phrase it as conspiracy, but as corruption. </p>
<p>Majority of Australian healthcare falls under publicly funded Medicare, so I <em>think</em> the implementation of any medical response had a strong preexisting framework it had to operate in which would reduce its size and scope of the fearmongering.</p>
<p>One interesting takeaway is that as long as tptb are following the rules to stay clean they have to play by rules, so people have more voice than we think.</p>

        <p>That's what I always tell people, just follow the money. WHO told the world to lock down based on flimsy evidence from an untrustworthy country, because they're funded mostly by a guy with major financial investments in vaccines and digital ID. It's not exactly news that Big Pharma and Big Tech are evil lying fucks.</p>

        <p>&rt;A pandemic outbreak of a coronavirus which would spread like wildfire and kill a predicted 65 million people. The simulation was held only a couple of months before the real thing happened at the start of 2020</p>
<p>I saw my first corona meme in mid November 2019 here on reddit, it was something about the average size penis increasing every second the corona virus is raging in china</p>
<p>And people started freaking out around March, honestly I blame social media for this pandemic there was so much joking around whit the new virus before the lockdowns started happening</p>

        <p>Just wanted to add, regarding the infertility fears brought up in the article: it's <em>not</em> just about fertility. The Pfizer vaccine appears to be dangerous for people with severe allergies: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/pfizer-covid-vaccine-nhs-extreme-allergy-sufferers-regulators-reaction</p>
<p>While the Moderna vaccine may cause endometriosis according to one whistleblower report, a condition that not only affects fertility but causes women regular bouts of severe, disabling pain: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10224422055324203&amp;id=1390710502</p>

        <p>Of course. Like the article says, they have no connection to 'little people' behaviour and can only access it through quanta and big data. These do not capture emotion. Therefore, they have no knowledge of the result their actions will have.</p>

        <p>&rt;They (the elites) generally tend to believe they have pulled the wool over everyone’s eyes the majority of the time. They think that you are a submissive idiot, and that when they bark an order, you will simply jump to attention because you “believe”.</p>
<p>They dont need 100% compliance because we live in democracy were only the majority need to be fooled and ((they)) succeeded to fool the majority, we are just a few who think corona is a scam, what they will do is to implement all the changes they want and the few of us who wont go along they will oppress until we fold or die and there will be immense public support for it. The Bible says that in the end it will be perilous times and a lot of people will be killed, there is no stopping ((them)).</p>
