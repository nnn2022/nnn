    <strong>Proposed study for mask efficacy</strong>
    <p><p>In an effort to test the effectiveness of masks, I see various types of experiments that seem unnecessarily complex and indirect.</p>
<p>For instance, there was a study performed where masked and unmasked individuals with influenza would cough into a vacuum tube and samples of virus would be taken from the surrounding air. Other studies look at overall infection rates in households by masked and unmasked individuals with unverified reports of proper usage. Finally, another subset of studies looks to infection rates of hospital workers without a control group of unmasked patients and/or unmasked workers.</p>
<p>I just wonder why someone doesn't look at the most obvious marker of potential infection which is virus detection in the nose, eyes or mouth of people walking around sick people with and without a mask. For instance, let's take the influenza virus as a potential area of study. Take a group of people that are confirmed to have no virus detected in those areas by a very simple sampling technique. Place them into a room with people that are indeed sick with the virus and showing symptoms, though wearing a mask. As a control, place another group of healthy individuals in a room with sick individuals that are not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>After simulating a particular environment, such as a shopping experience, dining experience or office experience, sample the healthy individuals for detection of the virus in the mouth, nose and eyes. If they have similar levels in both groups, then that would be rather clear evidence that masks do not change the risk of exposure. </p>
<p>If anyone knows of such a study, regardless of result, I would very much like to review it.</p></p>

        <p>There absolutely were studies like that done for the flu and SARS. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/">This metaanalysis</a> of studies that looked into the flu and masks  found the randomized controlled trials done do not support the notion that mask stops the spread of the flu.</p>
<p>Also, there was Danish randomized control trial done directly on COVID 19 that was supposed to give a definitive answer as to whether masks offered protection against it. Although the study has been completed Alex Berenson wrote on Twitter that its writers are struggling to find a journal that will publish it. Strange...</p>

        <p>Thank you for providing that link.</p>
<p>The authors' review of the matter continues to confirm that the science behind mandatory face masking is clearly not established, which could explain why even Dr. Fauci originally denounced the idea as wishful thinking:</p>
