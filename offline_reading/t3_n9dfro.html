        <p>It will all end when the CB's start to raise interest rates. The housing bubble, and the rest of the everything bubble. A bloody race to the exits. All paper will burn, and perhaps a lot of "secure" hard assets as well. My guess is somewhere between 2025-2030. And then the big reset of course, all planned and scripted.</p>

        <p>Warning signs have been there since Nixon closed the gold window in 1971, this is a crash 40 years in the making. This is pure and uncharted economic territory, with total unbound fiat money worldwide, but the cogs of the world economy turn slow. They need to have everything in place before they will let the crash happen. I've predicted negative interest rates around 2010 already myself, but it took another 11 years to finally get there. </p>
<p>Also, major NGOs like World bank saw covid support program until 2025. I think the script is covid/virus until 2025, build up as much debt as possible, first let the negative interest rates put all savings into risky waters, and skim of the rest of the ponzi scheme as much as possible. When that is done, crash.</p>

        <p>That's why we bought another 100 acres of tillable ground last year and we're completely out of equity market.  Negative savings rates would hurt some, but I moved a pile of cash off shore and bought land in the Caribbean.  Enough that if push comes to shove it's enough to buy citizenship, a house, and enough left over to be comfortable.</p>

        <p>I bought land as well recently, 80 acres, but for purposes of self-sufficiency. I don't have much cash, but at least I'll have my own food, and a nice garden around the house.</p>

        <p>I realized the forced business closures and UBI experiments were for real life testing and planning for what is to come.</p>
<p>Also, strengthening police forces while publicly talking about "defunding police" as a cover up.</p>
<p>By the way - actually watch and listen to Event 201 firsthand for yourself. All four parts. It's only a few hours but it will help your understanding going forward ...</p>

        <p>Yeah, same here until a couple of days ago. Finally I thought, "I really need to watch the whole thing."</p>
<p>And sure enough, when it started digging into censoring misinformation and using the "flood" technique to combat dissent -- I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>But not just that... Also the part where they communicate with people through their employers because most people trust the employer more than their government. I noticed that at the company I work for even before I saw Event 201. I remember thinking, "How does the company president know so much about what's going on? Does he get a phone call?"</p>
<p>And watching Event 201 I thought... why would we trust our employers?!</p>
<p>That latter point is important, because the Covid-19 response is a real world test scenario to prepare for a financial crisis like we haven't seen since 1929. </p>
<p>The point of communicating through the employer is because when the REAL crisis finally unfolds, it will be economic. And who is more critical when it comes to our finances than our employer?</p>
<p>So they tested employer-based communications for what will come later.</p>
<p>Anyhow, watch it and connect the dots yourself. Event 201 was no "coincidence" and anyone who suggests that 1) is incredibly naive and/or 2) hasn't watched it to completion themselves.</p>

        <p>Thanks brother, good work. Will do. N.B. I have a database of hundreds of corona/covid/mask predictions, no worries. :). I know it's all planned. I personally believe corona viruses were actually invented in 1968 for the sole purpose to serve their "crown" work in the 21st century, when the technology to pull it off would be ready.</p>

        <p>Cash is a large danger, when the reset comes all cash might be worthless, but probably we will see hyperinflation by then, if not hidden already. But going in debt is risky as well, when interest rates rise. Hard assets all the way, a house, land, gold. Get any loan paid off as much as possible as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>And with gold I mean physical gold, not tradeable paper gold assets. You might go in crypto, but I fear that will turn worthless as soon as the officially backed government crypto will hit the streets.</p>

        <p>Yes, savings are a very dangerous thing to have right now and going forward. With negative interest rates, AND a hidden hyperinflation going on, you'll lose purchasing power very rapidly. Grandma's saving attitude is no longer of any use, on purpose. Their goal is to slowly push you to endanger your money by going into risky investments, and your goal is to not fall for this trick.</p>
<p>Diversification is always good. I would get acquainted with buying gold bullion, doesn't need to be so much, but it will make you understand the mechanics of it. Also, think about buying a cheap house or apartment, without or with minimum mortgage, or a piece of land you might exploit in the future, e.g. for producing food, or to escape the cities. Something that has value in the future, after your dollar/euro has turned into a new currency with a disastrous exchange rate.</p>
<p>You could ride the stock and crypto hype, but everything has an end. Don't risk it all.</p>
