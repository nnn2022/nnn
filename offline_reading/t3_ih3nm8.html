        <p>(1) Here you go the new green deal   - “Building back better means building back greener.”  Joe Biden unveils his $2T AOC-fueled Green New Deal energy agenda Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden unveiled a $2 trillion energy plan Tuesday with a heavy focus on the Green New Deal agenda being pushed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the far-left flank of his party. https://nypost.com/2020/07/14/joe-biden-unveils-his-2t-aoc-fueled-green-new-deal-energy-agenda/</p>
<p>(2) ‘Green New Deal’ Will Look Like Pandemic Lockdown  https://www.technocracy.news/green-new-deal-will-look-like-pandemic-lockdown/</p>
<p>(3) November 25, 2019 The Trump administration formally notified the United Nations it will withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
<p>The Trump administration formally notified the United Nations it will withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement (PCA).</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in a November 4 tweet the United States had filed formal paperwork to withdraw, citing an “unfair economic burden” on U.S. workers, businesses, and taxpayers.</p>
<p>The exit, announced the first day the government could start the process under the terms of the agreement, will become official on November 4, 2020, the day after the next presidential election.</p>
<p>The administration filed the paperwork a little over two years after President Donald Trump held a June 2, 2017 Rose Garden event at which Trump, keeping a campaign commitment, announced he would take the United States out of the agreement at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>Putting America Before Paris</p>
<p>When Trump was running for president, he repeatedly called the PCA a bad deal for the United States, saying it would cost jobs and put the nation at a competitive disadvantage with other countries not required to restrict their energy use or make emission reductions.</p>
<p>“It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,” Trump said at the 2017 event announcing his intention to withdraw from the agreement.

        <p>So here's what I think: Human caused climate change is likely real and governments should take steps to avoid further damage. However, I don't think carbon is the end all be all. It should be pretty by partisan to want to preserve nature as much as possible. Despite what the carbon hacks on the left tell you, this should include wishing to preserve forests, waterways, oceans, etc. that don't have anything to do with reducing carbon per se.</p>
<p>I'd say a more holistic approach to environmentalism might actually become somewhat bi-partisan if we took the myopic focus on carbon off of the table. It isn't hard to imagine that Republicans and conservatives of all stripes would want to preserve forests and waterways for the purpose of enjoying them, hunting and fishing. </p>
<p>That being said, I think we should be aimed at reducing carbon through technology adoption, but the amounts called for by the GND are pretty disruptive to our economy and way of life and therefore out of balance. </p>
<p>I used to blame the right (and the Kochs) for making it a partisan issue, but I don't think that is entirely true. There is some blame there, but the left has demonized conservation efforts such as hunting and the "rugged man in the wilderness" for decades now. They have called for vehicle buyback programs, which, yes aim to reduce emissions but fail to see the hidden cost in emissions of constantly producing new vehicles which get fractionally better gas mileage, but don't account for the carbon intensive process to produce said vehicle in the first place. </p>
<p>A big part of the "green" lifestyle is based in aesthetics and aimed at making placid urban dwellers feel superior to their more "macho" working-class, rural counterparts. </p>
<p>It is no surprise that the luxury class has adopted the green philosophy at the same time when they are doing everything they can to purge the working class (and therefore anything the working class values: strong men, feminine women, the nuclear and traditional family, religion, etc.)</p>
<p>And I for one, as a long time supporter of environmental efforts who would like to see the environment as a whole (and our relationship to it) preserved, do not trust the WHO, the WEF, and other global elites to address climate change through top-down social engineering and deceit. </p>
<p>The Green New Deal can kiss my ass.</p>

        <p>HA meanwhile Fauci came out today and was like “y’all chill. We are definitely getting back to normal.” I have a feeling seeing stuff like this alerts to Fauci that if the public thinks they’re never getting back to normal, that’s really not good for what they’re trying to achieve currently. The WHO has no say at all in what we do here. It behooves Fauci to step in and remind people that what’s on the menu for the WHO isn’t  on the menu for us.</p>
