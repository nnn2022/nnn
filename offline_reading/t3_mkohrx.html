    <strong>Vaccine Question</strong>
    <p><p>I already know I don't want any vaccine. I'm just having trouble figuring out why.</p>
<p>I've heard that it's actually highly experimental gene therapy, who said this and is this all vaccines or just some?</p>
<p>I've also heard that it will never exempt you from any COVID restrictions, nor will it grant you immunity or even near immunity to COVID, it it will just make the symptoms weaker.  I am not and never really have been afraid of COVID, so I honestly don't see the point.</p>
<p>Either way, I don't want the vaccine because it's another thing, like masks, that the government is semi-forcing upon us, and I think that's absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>I'm only 15, so it might not be my decision, but I want to to all in my power of to get the vaccine. My parents think the mask mandates and lockdowns are wrong, so I figured they'd be anti-vax or vax hesitant. However, my grandparents came over yesterday (We never wear masks around them, nor do they, they don't care.) and they were talking about how they were scheduled to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don't blame them. I don't blame anyone who gets the vaccine. But I don't want it myself. My parents were talking to them genuinely intrigued as to how the process of signing up for it worked, and it seems to me as though my parents want the vaccine as soon as it is available to them I just don't know how to explain to them, if they want the vaccine, that I do not.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay two people have sent me links and my parents parental controls app has blocked them on my phone... I don't think that's just coincidence... anyway, I'll look them up on my computer later.</p></p>

        <p>Worst case scenario if they did try to force you, you call up your local health freedom group for advice. Even worse case you get CPS involved and then it gets tied up in courts. Doubt your parents would want to go that far. </p>
<p>When I was your age my parents tried to force something (non-medical related) and I told them if they did not respect my wishes, they would never see me again. Very tricky subjects, I doubt you will have that issue. Just show them the data from wonder.cdc.gov vaers, or this aggregate: https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</p>

        <p>It is the worst option, but still an option. This is a life or death decision and people (including parents) are woefully misinformed about the risks. Desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that getting covid is more likely to kill you than the vaccine... And considering almost a tenth of US population has already had covid and the rate is probably going to stay somewhat similar among the population who don't take vaccines, I'm like at least 99% certain the vaccine is the safer option here.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, "it should be fine if everyone who wants it gets it, right?" Well, not really. If you allow the disease bounce back and forth between the unvaccinated population, it'll mutate - and sooner or later it's going to become resistant to the vaccines and then you'll be responsible for another pandemic.</p>
<p>I'm 100% for anything and everything that incentivizes people to take the vaccine even if we take parents away from the equation - and when we're talking about a 15 year old hanging around on anti-vax forums, I'm 100% in the support of their parents being able to decide their child is getting the vaccine.</p>

<p>Wrong. And I won't read the rest of your comment. 99.97% survival rate of fake virus 'covid'. And that's their numbers... It is probably much higher since most of us who actually go outside, or work customer service got this "illness" you are calling a new virus, in early to late 2019 way before you even heard of it. My mother got it in 2018 and the only thing that helped was restoring her gut health with ACV &amp; probiotics. </p>
<p>Waxscene is 90% effective. You don't know shit so just admit it instead of trying to sound important here. None of us know shit, but we do know <strong>bullshit</strong> when we see it. You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p>Seriously done wasting my time with idiots that spout this bullshit without a lick of research. https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</p>
<p>You will know the truth soon, and it will affect you personally. You will die, or be injured and wondering who you should be angry at. One of your family members will die, or be injured... and again you will be wondering who to be angry at. Please direct your anger in the proper direction and bury them forever.</p>

        <p>They all are very different from other vaccines. This is an outright lie I see people say some are just like flu shots. Covid vaccines are using viral vectors and DNA or mRNA to force your body to create the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus.
AstroZeneca &amp; JohnsonJohnson are viral vector, Pfizer &amp; Moderna are mRNA. </p>
<p>Aside from the problems of these technologies overall there is also the huge issue with problems of developing safe cornona vaccines that they have no proof that theyve overcome, in fact reactions to the vaccine we see prove that they havent overcome them.</p>
