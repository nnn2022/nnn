    <strong>The Discord Server</strong>
    <p><p>Just a heads up to those that are interested in using the Discord, you might want to find a different option or create your own. The moderation on the server as it stands now is woefully lacking. One of the Discord moderators went rogue today, creating numerous fake accounts and saying extremely offensive and unhinged things. It caused a paranoid frenzy among a number of the members, and the moderator response was basically "don't talk about it" while doing nothing to deal with outcome of this weird event (namely, actual members of the server being roped in and accused of being one of said mods alt accounts). This is just the perspective of someone who joined the discord a week ago, enjoyed talking to everyone and engaging, and then was accused of being a bot and basically forced off the server because it was so unbearable to deal with the harassment with 0 support. Just a word of advice if you ever actually want anything you guys are working on to get off the ground - allowing waves of trolls in with no pushback whatsoever is not how you grow a community. Thanks but no thanks.</p></p>

        <p>Ah, that might actually explain some of what I was seeing then. It sucks that there's no established spot to discuss things that isn't overrun by trolls or mismanaged or both.</p>

        <p>The way i see it, is that it's a good way to vent and share our frustrations that we might have sometimes through real time chat. It's more socially rewarding, at least for me. I didn't know there was a Discord server though.</p>
