        <p>While I don't agree with most of what was said, and I feel kinda bad for all the comments that always seem to pop up in these posts about how the masks make them feel good cause they get to hide their "ugly face"... I still agree with the main idea of the post, that being: bothering people or treating them with condescension for the personal choice to wear a mask is not ok. I thought we were all about personal choices in this sub.</p>
<p>I don't think I'd be that bothered if this brings about a slight cultural shift in the sense that people are comfortable wearing masks whenever they feel like it, being for health or even fashion reasons (similar to how it is in Japan, as I understand it). </p>
<p>Of course I'd be absolutely against that cultural shift bringing along a smug sense of superiority on either side of the mask wearing spectrum. </p>
<p>Let's not bother people for living their lives and then demand of them to leave us alone, is my point.</p>

        <p>This. We’ve been mocked. Attacked. They’ve wished a slow death on us. Why show them mercy? If it was up to them we would all be denied our paychecks and healthcare simply because we won’t stay home, wear the mask and get the jab. They’ve shown no empathy for the people who lost their jobs or businesses. No empathy for the children robbed of over a year if education, scholarships and important milestones. I agree it’s a personal choice to wear a mask and while I won’t say things out loud to the maskers, I will silently judge. My next door neighbors had a 4th of July get together with friends today and I saw multiple show up in masks and I did chuckle to myself. These neighbors have stayed home religiously until the last 2-3 weeks! They wouldn’t even take their baby for a walk!</p>

        <p>I think you're looking at this from an "us vs them" perspective. </p>
<p>Have you considered maybe the person you mock was always against masks being forced on people and simply likes wearing them? Wearing a mask because you personally like them for whatever reason doesn't make you responsible for the crazy cultists that used them as an excuse to harrass people.</p>

        <p>I'm really sad to see that people here are taking those  things as a religious symbol just as much as the covidians.</p>
<p>No, I don't think choosing to wear  a mask makes you a "masker". I'm not defending the people that <em>did</em> harrass others about the masks, just saying dumping everyone you see wearing them with the "maskers" makes you just as paranoid and cult-like as them.</p>
<p>And before anyone acusses me of it, I personally don't like wearing them, this is about calling out the hypocrisy. I thought people here were above this, guess any group devolves into dogmatic, autoritarian cunts when it gains enough traction.</p>

        <p>But folks here are bothering people who wear mask and took the vaccine, whether or not they also tried to force this practice on others, so it goes both ways. Unless you only ridicule people who is trying to force people into their ways, i bet if someone merely gave advise and opinion about taking the vaccine and wearing a mask and not trying to force it on others you will still think it is blasphemous.</p>
<p>Like it is ok for us to tell people we dont need to wear a mask, or the vaccine is unsafe and unproven, but others cannot tell people how a mask and vaccine can reduce the chance of getting infected. Welp, feels just like the same in covid subs except they are just standing on the opposite of the fence.</p>
<p>Sensible person would try to ve neutral and take in info from both sides and make their own decisions.</p>

        <p>Most people I've seen in this sub were simply against authoritarian meassures and cult-like covidians getting all up in other people's business. </p>
<p>That's why I'm calling it out when it comes to the other side of the argument too. I'm here cause I feel we just want to be left alone and not be forced to conform to what some stranger considers "the right way to live", seems hypocritical to start harrassing people for making a different choice than us when it comes to personal lifestyle.</p>
<p>I'm still strongly against the propaganda, forcing it unto children and all that jazz, but if some adult wants to wear a mask because of whatever reason they have every right to.</p>

        <p>Well children never really have rights or else britney spears wouldn't be wearing a chastity belt. Its the law, what can we do about it? Provax people cant even get children of antivaxxers to vax up even for the common old vaccines. What makes you think you can stop a provaxxer from having their children vaxxed up? Just worry about yourself and folks around you and hope you wont get forcefully vaxxed one day like Russia and Philippines.</p>

        <p>Sure, the children side of it is up to the parents, I wouldn't want to tell you what to do with your child either, I guess I just meant I'm more bothered by it being a parental enforcement and not a personal choice, but I guess that's life.</p>
<p>And as for that last part, that's exactly what I do. Which is why it bothers me to see people not mind their own business and bother their neighbours, whether it's "you have to mask up and take whatever big pharma wants to shove down your throat" or "omg, sheeple, wake up and take those masks off" it all sounds the same to me: assholes trying to make others conform to their own way of life</p>
<p>Though at the end of the day you could even say I'm trying to do the same by trying to make everyone mind their own business lol</p>
