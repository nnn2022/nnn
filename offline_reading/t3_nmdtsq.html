    <strong>How are you dealing with getting constantly questioned if you have the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I live and work in the Bay Area in California and work for a large corporation. I am in outside sales so pre covid I spend most of my day in the field traveling and making sales calls. March 2020 we went to work from home and things were... alright I guess. Now that things are beginning to open up again and people are starting to see others face to face I am constantly getting asked if I have taken the vaccine yet. So far my employer has not even really mentioned the vaccine but my clients are starting to say they will only be allowing vaccinated people into their office. It's kind of strange to me how it's ok now to ask people about their private medical decisions. Just feel kind of trapped because in order for me to even be around these people I almost have to just say that I am vaccinated. Something that I have not done yet. Anyone else in a similar situation? It has been progressively getting worse and worse and I am wondering how others are dealing with it.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly just lie if you‚Äôre that pressured. Who cares? If these idiots really feel that much better about the word ‚Äúyes‚Äù then let them have it lol.</p>
<p>Or just say ‚Äúno.‚Äù And don‚Äôt draw anymore attention to that. If people have further questions just say ‚Äújust haven‚Äôt.‚Äù You don‚Äôt owe anyone an explanation.</p>

        <p>But let‚Äôs say that he lies. What if one of his clients finds out he isn‚Äôt vaccinated? They‚Äôll sue him &amp; his boss &amp; their company. A lie just to placate someone will beget another lie more bigger than the first &amp; will eventually balloon to such an enormous extent that once it pops then major fallout will happen.</p>

        <p>How would a client find out that they weren‚Äôt vaccinated? Unless your employer is actively seeking documentation, then they would have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>I really think all this comes down to <em>is</em> placating these morons. I think most of them are just happy to keep up the illusion that they‚Äôre ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù</p>

        <p>All I‚Äôm saying is that we‚Äôve been witnessing lies upon lies upon lies from all levels of government. While I think placating someone to escape an uncomfortable situation might be good, in the long run I don‚Äôt think u/IRIEVIBRATIONS would want to continually lie all the time. None of us are going to get out of this mess if we continually placate others. I‚Äôm on the chopping block unfortunately because I got called out for my anti-vaxx stance. I‚Äôm scared, and don‚Äôt know what to do, but I‚Äôve stood my ground for now and I‚Äôm just waiting to see what Management has next up their sleeve towards me. I don‚Äôt want to be pushed around any longer and I‚Äôm tired of giving up my sovereignty.</p>

        <p>Exactly, I'm in no way an "anti-vaxxer" and believe that vaccines are effective and useful. It's Just this one in particular for a sickness that I have already had I don't see why its necessary for me to take it. I don't understand why people who have already had the vaccine would even care about being around someone who isn't vaccinated. Isn't it supposed to protect them? How would I be a danger?</p>

        <p>If you have had it you also have an additional route out that gives you the moral high crowd.</p>
<p>The FDA has an emergency authorization for COVID plasma treatments.</p>
<p>They are used for those who can't receive the vaccine, advanced stage cancer patients, some organ transplant patients, previous vaccine injury victims, those under 12, and other immune compromised individuals.</p>
<p>You can't donate for this if you had the vaccine, they also provide you with paper work showing that you have COVID antibodies if you ask </p>
<p>This is my get out of jail card if my work asks for vaccine proof. I work for the federal government, so far they have not, but could change in a few months.</p>
