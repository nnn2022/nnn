    <strong>The threats they make are empty. They can do nothing without acceptance and belief in their illusory power.</strong>
    <p><p>Stop playing by their rules. If you own a business and they try and shut you down, just stay open. They can threaten you with things like fines and other bullshit, but they have nothing to actually enforce that. Completely empty threats.</p>
<p>Stop wearing masks. If the business tells you to wear one, say you have a medical condition. If they keep insisting, leave and go somewhere else. Also leave them negative 1 star reviews on google/yelp/facebook/etc. Give 5 star reviews to businesses that don't enforce bullshit masks or social distancing.</p>
<p>If a random person tells you to wear a mask or gets in your face, tell them to fuck off and that if they get close to you you'll consider it a physical threat and will be forced to defend yourself. These people are pussies, they won't do anything except go home and complain on reddit, twitter and facebook.</p>
<p>Encourage disobedience among other likeminded people. This is the only solution. We can't wait for these fake overlords to give back our freedoms, that will never happen. We must actively disregard them and their empty threats.</p>
<p>Mock and ridicule doomers and branch covidians as much as possible. Don't get angry, just mock them as the losers they are. Tell them they're ugly and that's why they want masks forever. Agree and amplify what they want, like saying we should weld people into their homes, force people to wear biohazard uniforms, etc. Don't argue logically, just ridicule and mock these evil pieces of shit.</p>
<p>You have the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. Your forefathers would never have bent over and taken this sort of abuse. Stand up and be the change you want to see.</p></p>

        <p>Two of my employees were upset that I won’t let them yell at and powertrip on customers over masks, and they say how “other businesses” are much more strict about it. But like over two dozen of some of the most prominent businesses in our region that I frequent regularly without a mask haven’t said boo to me. The only places they can name to me that they <em>say</em> strictly enforce it are where people are touching you, like salons, doctors, dentist, massage, chiropractic etc, or really small sole-proprietor boutiquey places.</p>

        <p>Brilliant post! I have the CDC stats memorized, in case I get harassed for not wearing a mask on the sidewalk. It shuts them up when they see you're not the ignorant, conspiracy theory babbling bastard child of Honey Boo Boo and Dale Gribble. One woman told me to wear a mask when I was unloading groceries into my car. I was having a particularly bad day, and I said, "Your lockdowns have given me a nervous breakdown". It wasn't a lie. She was not expecting that!</p>

        <p>Here's the exact script:
"You're harassing people over a virus with a 99.98% survival rate for those under age 60.
99.5% survival for ages 60 to 69.
94.6% survival rate for 70 and up, including those in their 70s and 80s. This is from the CDC."
Deliver it very flatly, and they back off.</p>

        <p>Last week my daughter went to a small town outside of the state capital, in a super uber nasty Democrat state and she said 70% of full families shopping wore no masks and were not questioned at all. This will come down to segregation. I feel that like minded people will go where they feel safe. If that means a MASK NAZI HELL, then there will be a place for that. If you want alternatives, there will be places that populations gather in that fashion. </p>
<p>I pray for this planet constantly based on the sheer stupidity and ignorance that I see happening. To think how many people gave their lives for freedom, only to have it slip away because people are CYBORG DRONES incapable of forming their own thoughts make me want to vomit.</p>

However, I wouldn't even mention that in my review lest I make them look attractive to covidians.

        <p>I'm going back and leaving 1 star reviews on all masked up mask obsessed businesses. And giving 5 stars to ones who support freedom. It's funny as well because the masked businesses are struggling while the ones without are doing fine. I wonder why..</p>

        <p>The time for debate has long since passed. There is no more civil debate. There is no reasoning with these people. Make sure they know that. Make sure they know that you are just as much of a brick wall as they are. </p>
<p>You are the immovable object, and they are the unstoppable force. Give such little regard to them that they just stop talking to you. Eventually they'll realize that nobody wants to hear their shit and they'll shut up.</p>

        <p>Absolutely this.</p>
<p>Who cares if they fine your business. Don't pay it, fight that shit in court and drag it out as long as possible. Look at how many illegal pot dispensaries operated for *years* with no business license, literally trafficking "drugs" with basically no penalty. Even the odd time the police did decide to raid them, often they would be back up and running the next day. Other examples too but the point being that the government has basically no ability to truly enforce... just about anything (depending where you live.. talking about canada/usa here). Their only tools of enforcement are A) fines and B) jail, which is mostly reserved for the underclass and poor, and is really just a temporary "time out" unless you are killing people. Their only tool outside of physical arrest to enforce fines is by controlling the financial system and seizing your bank account. But with the advent of cryptocurrencies and all the different digital payment solutions out there, the power to freeze your accounts goes away / becomes meaningless (interest rates at banks were garbage anyway, crappy place to keep any funds). The leaves arrest and jail as the only real enforcement tool left. In which case even if every single police officer was put to task enforcing mask/social distancing laws 24/7 and nothing else ignoring all other crimes, they still could not do it. All they can do is make examples out of the most extreme or high profile cases.</p>
<p>Definitely avoid wearing a mask at all times possible. People appreciate being able to clearly hear your voice and to see your facial expressions like a normal human being. There is no actual reason to wear one and no actual proof that it has had literally any effect on stopping the virus. Funny how the more strict places get with mask wearing and the more they hammer it into everyones heads... "record shattering cases" every single day. Hmm, how many more people need to wear masks all day before results are seen and numbers actually go down? Why does it seem like almost everyone who is confirming positive and getting sick, also a dedicated mask wearer?</p>
<p>Leaving bad reviews with businesses that make masks mandatory is a great idea. So many assholes out there that have hurt small businesses by leaving reviews bitching that they weren't trying hard enough to "follow the rules", or crying about seeing someone else without a mask or not social distancing enough inside the store. Fuck those people, and business owners need to be shown that this shit goes both ways. Treat every customer like they have the plague and give shitty service, see what fucking happens. As for the big corporates that aren't going to care about reviews or just have them deleted anyway, take your business elsewhere and shop local as much as possible. It's also funny how places like Wal Mart say masks are mandatory and pay their greeter at the front to shove masks in your face with their stupid tongs. If you just say no and walk by, they just whimper "but it's mandatory.." and then nobody does or says a word the rest of the time even at the till lol. If you are going to make it mandatory and literally refuse entry if no face covering, you better fucking have security ready and standing by to pull me out. Complete joke.</p>
<p>Also yes for mocking those that are obsessed with wearing their dirty face diapers everywhere. It's actually pretty disgusting if you spend more than 5 seconds thinking about it, plus bad for the environment, and discriminatory, arguably even abusive against certain groups of people, including children.  These authoritarians think that they can "publicly shame" others into compliance, well again this shit goes both ways.</p>
<p>To OPs final point, public health orders by unelected health officials are not due process of law and do not magically invalidate our bill of rights. Making masks mandatory, limiting gatherings (especially within your own home), locking down the country and preventing travel... these are quite literally violations of our rights. We always here about "rights being taken away" usually with no further clarification. But here we are in a case where actually yeah they are trying to take away your rights. You have a right to life, liberty, security and enjoyment of property, and you cannot be deprived of such without due process of law (which means judge and jury, not news articles and health official announcements). Also freedom of assembly and association, freedom of speech etc... any politician or health official or media talking head that tries to tell you otherwise, they can go get fucked.</p>

        <p>&rt; mock and ridicule doomers and branch covidians as much as possible. Don’t get angry, just mock them as the losers they are. Tell them they’re ugly and that’s why they want masks forever. </p>

        <p>The reason lockdowns are still happening is because the elite take advantage and make profit from them. They'll pretend we are in danger and how much they care, but it's obvious these greedy fucks only care about money. Don't be fooled, they don't care about people suffering or dying.</p>

        <p>That’s so insane. Idk why you call people who want to not get a deadly virus doomers people are dying and it’s not a crime to want that shit to end by people wearing a piece of cloth on their face and not going out and partying for a little bit</p>

        <p>people die every day. Viruses have always existed. "not partying for a bit" and "wearing a piece of cloth on their face" does not stop anything or even really slow it down. Grow up.</p>

        <p>How does it not slow it down the mask reduces transmissions and not partying and going out reduces your chance of catching it out in public or possibly transmitting it</p>
