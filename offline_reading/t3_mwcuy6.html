    <strong>Thoughts on this study being used to tout vaccines as safe in pregnant women?</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983</p>
<p>I’m pregnant myself and there’s no way I’m getting this vaccine regardless of if I was or not. </p>
<p>However, with Google being ridiculously biased, it’s nearly impossible for me to find any type of actual study on these vaccines, let alone one that may not shed a positive light on them. But I’m being bombarded with “science” from friends/family saying it’s safe since their search engine is happy doll out propaganda stating so. </p>
<p>What I find wrong with this study is it’s based off self-reporting and they had an initial group of 35k women so why are the results only of 827? 
Any other critiques or a more solid analysis of this?
Links to better proof about the safety or lack thereof with these vaccines?</p>
<p>I know I’m literally asking for confirmation bias. Ex-vegan here so I understand confirmation bias. However, I’ve dismantled my entire core beliefs once based off being exposed to credible information and I’m not unwilling to do that again-I just simply don’t find anything out out in favor credible.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure how anyone who's read this would conclude that this is remotely supportive of the idea of a sAfE aNd EfFeCtIvE vaxx for pregnant women.</p>
<p>&rt;Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester).</p>
<p>Who would take such odds with their own child???</p>
<p>&rt;A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant....To identify persons who received one or both Covid-19 vaccine doses while pregnant or who became pregnant after Covid-19 vaccination, v-safe surveys include pregnancy questions for persons who do not report their sex as male. Persons who identify as pregnant are then contacted by telephone and, if they meet inclusion criteria, are offered enrollment in the v-safe pregnancy registry. Eligible persons are those who received vaccination during pregnancy or in the periconception period (30 days before the last menstrual period through 14 days after) and are 18 years of age or older. For persons who choose to enroll, the pregnancy registry telephone-based survey collects detailed information about the participant, including medical and obstetric history, pregnancy complications, birth outcomes, and contact information for obstetric and pediatric health care providers to obtain medical records; infants are followed through the first 3 months of life.</p>
<p>TLDR: The methodology of this StUdY enables me (M, 30) to be included if I *IDENTIFY* as being pregnant based on a *TELEPHONE-BASED SURVEY.*</p>
<h1>SeTtLeD sCiEnCe!</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;... infants are followed through the first 3 months of life.</p>
<p>Who cares about what happens to them after 3 months, right!?</p>

        <p>Thank you! Yeah I knew the methodology was insane. </p>
<p>As for miscarriage rate, that’s about on point with the national average, however I was curious about what stage of the pregnancy they miscarried because 13% is the average for all pregnancies whereas after 14-20 weeks gestation, the miscarriage rate drops to less than 1%</p>
<p>I critiqued that as misrepresenting statistics and my brother said that the raw data supports those statistics where only 1% of the miscarriages were in the third trimester- which leads me to question what a “completed pregnancy” is classified as?? Because the article for the study says they don’t have any information on pregnancy outcomes from women vaxed in the 1st trimester while the study also claims that the majority of miscarriages were in the first trimester. I suppose any end to any pregnancy is a “completed pregnancy” even if it was completed by miscarriage. Regardless, if the only 13% rate of miscarriage is true then it would be on par with the national average, however what’s the deal with having 35k initial participants and only reporting on 827? And it’s self reporting at that. Anyone who signs up to get the covid jab while pregnant is so vaccine brainwashed, I don’t likely believe that they would continue with their self reporting if it would look negatively upon the vax. </p>
<p>What sucks is that everything wrong with this study is simply speculation and critical thinking, two things people pro covid will just blow off and label you a conspiracy theorist for taking issue with.</p>

        <p>Do you know what I realised in 2020? Any ScIeNcE supporting the C19 narrative is always wrong and can be critiqued by looking at the methodology. I am yet to be proven wrong.</p>

        <p>You won't find any unbiased study because it is impossible. These vaccine drugs are not in the open market. That means every paper you find as a proof to something cannot be independently analyzed, it cannot be independently tested, it cannot be independently verified, as these drugs are not available to buy or trade independently.</p>
<p>So all you have is a marketing pitch from a drug monopoly. And medical doctors all they know is the literature by big pharma. They can't test anything either.</p>

<p>It's impossible to study the effects of prenatal vaccinations on 10 year olds in only a few months. Literally impossible to say it will not cause developmental problems. Claiming otherwise is fantasy.</p>
<p>Stay strong!! Your child is going to be a superhuman compared to their vaccinated (genetically altered) peers.</p>

        <p>Your response doesn't make any logical sense because no one is claiming that covid-19 is safe for pregnant women and prenatal infants, but they are saying the vaccine is safe, so the burden of proof is with them.</p>
