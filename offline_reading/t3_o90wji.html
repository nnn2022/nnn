    <strong>Shout out to all my like-minded friends</strong>
    <p><p>At the beginning of all this, I thought I was in the minority group of the people questioning COVID and the illogical steps the government and the so-called "experts" were telling us we had to take. Then I found this sub, and was like "I'm not crazy" (we'll I might still be, but not about this). </p>
<p>A lot of other people are seeing this BS too. We may still be in the minority at the moment, but we're getting stronger every day due to the half-speak and illogical behavior being exhibited by people WE have put in power. </p>
<p>I want to thank everyone on this sub, and please remember what your elected representatives did or did not do come voting day.</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same way.  Fortunately I have a few close family members who think the same way as us, but anyone outside those people (including everyone at work) I just try not to engage - I can't possibly even begin to explain to them how much of what they believe to be true simply isn't.  </p>
<p>Coming to this board is a daily relief from the crazy and gives me at least a bit of hope in humanity!</p>

        <p>The red line for normies has been the lack of freedom post vaccination.  Our vindication is only a few months away.  I predict when govts start talking about 3rd and 4th shots.  Canâ€™t wait for them to eat their own shit.</p>

        <p>It's ok to be insane in a world that's defined insanity as being civil and obedient. Finding the true people to be around has been the gift I needed but I need more as I have a lot to discus and fight.</p>

        <p>I've been over this shit for over a year, since Dr Zelenko proved hydroxychloroquine works.
Fortunately, the majority of my friends know what's really going on, including everyone at my local bar. Only a couple got the sheeple shot.</p>
