    <strong>I question that a relative died of COVID-19 recently</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone. So I'll get right to it, I recently had a distant relative die a few days ago. He lived in N.C. he had apparently slipped and fell or something along that line, But when he got to the hospital, he passed and the doctor said he died of covid 19. I question this as the CDC recently admitted that 94% of covid deaths were the result of people that had some underlying problem. It has also been reported that the CDC and many coroners had been miscalculating the numbers for a while now. I don't remember him being sick before, so I find it strange how a slip can apparently mean you had covid. I unironically think that medical officials are literally just taking recently deceased and slapping the label of covid 19 on their death certificate. I'm not trying to start a huge debate or being a science denier, but this just doesn't seem right. I have serious doubts that he died of covid 19. What do y'all think?</p></p>

        <p>My great aunt died a couple of months ago. She was 96. She had gastrointestinal cancer and was literally a lifelong smoker, started smoking when she was 12. My uncle found her at home and called to have her resuscitated (why?). We are in NYS. Any possible covid case doesnt get resuscitated and is marked as a covid death. She lived at home, smoked her whole life, had cancer, and was 96. She was put down as a covid death.</p>

<p>Wait why wouldn’t you rescucitate her if you could? I question why NY wouldn’t either. That could be why they have such a high death toll compared with most of the world.</p>

        <p>She was 96 with cancer and didnt want to be resuscitated. But I suppose that part is more a family issue. 
Yes i agree thats part of why NYS has such high numbers. I dont know if it is still the policy but during our peak it was. Basically everyone was a potential covid case, and resuscitating would release air droplets, so it wasnt to be done. I was worried because my mother has CHF.</p>

        <p>I didn’t know “possible” cases were not resuscitated. </p>
<p>That’s super disturbing considering nearly any type of symptom you present with is now looked at as possible COVID.</p>
<p>Seems like another contributing factor to the high death count. People are being left to die even when they may not have it and the COVID label gets slapped on the death certificate after the fact.</p>

        <p>Can I ask, why would you resuscitate a very very elderly person (with cancer too) who has died at home, their brain starved of oxygen for who knows how long but a significant period of time, and if resuscitated is nearly never going to have a good outcome that enables her to survive nevermind with any quality of life? Or makes it even more traumatic for her family because if they get her heart started by some miracle, that doesnt mean survival and puts them in a position where they need to turn off life support? My family has been there with my baby brother and it's awful.</p>
<p>CPR is best started within 2 minutes for the best possible outcome, even in young healthy people. At just a minute without oxygen your brain cells have started to die. Irreversible brain damage happens within 3-9 minutes, and at just 3 minutes your neurons have suffered extensive damage, by 5 minutes significant brain damage has likely occurred and death is an increasingly likely outcome, by 10 minutes if the brain is still alive (brain death may have occurred) significant irreversible brain damage is pretty much an inevitable outcome if survival occurs, and after 15 minutes survival is almost never possible and brain death usually occurs with some exceptions - it's not pretty as an outcome. </p>
<p>What are the chances he found her within a couple of minutes? Then the time it takes paramedics to arrive? Slim to none he found her so quickly. </p>
<p>Resuscitation is violent and ribs can be broken (an elderly person makes this even more likely due to their frail bones) and sometimes punctured lungs and internal bleeding occurs, life support takes an incredible toll even on a healthy young person. I've been through it as a healthy young person, was found within minutes of my heart stopping and not breathing by police trained in CPR - the best situation. I suffered rib fractures and my lungs felt so bruised but as a young person they heal quickly. I suffered a mild brain injury - only mild because I was found so quickly by those trained - but it was still frustrating to deal with. But being young meant my brain bounced back, that doesn't happen with 96 year old brains even when the hypoxic injury is mild which wouldn't be the case for someone found at home like this the vast majority of the time.</p>
<p>This poor 96 year old woman would have been completely deprived of oxygen for far far longer so if by some "miracle" her heart was started her brain if not dead would be so far gone. Why would you put their body through the violence of CPR when she was never coming back as the person she was even if they got her heart started? The likely outcome even then would be brain death and her family needing to turn off life support. A severely brain damaged (but truth is the likely outcome would still have been brain death) very elderly person with cancer on top of it would be a cruel bloody outcome even if she survived to come off a vent. She wouldn't be her. </p>
<p>I don't understand why you would be surprised at resuscitation not exactly being the best choice in such circumstances? I just don't understand people who insist why not resuscitate at all costs???</p>

        <p>Some people can't accept death, they want any invasive and extreme measure possible to sustain a beating heart even when a person is gone. It's understandable to not want a loved one to die, but...</p>

        <p>Very old people crash and die following falls all the time. They suffer sudden and terrifying cognitive declines after falls and die. Other conditions and illnesses seem to sense the moment of weakness and swoop down on them after falls. It's uncanny, both my grandparents had falls that dramatically changed their mental and physical health despite the actual injuries being less serious than you'd think.</p>

        <p>What they're doing is testing every one who comes in the door and most people will test positive because the fucking virus is everywhere ... It just doesn't harm most people. So when someone dies of unrelated causes (e.g., broken hip, diabetes, lung cancer, etc.) Then BOOM! Another COVID death. Mark it down!</p>
