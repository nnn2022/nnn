        <p>I don’t think a lot of people realize it. I don’t want to realize it myself but it’s beginning to look like the next couple years are going to be much of the same.</p>

        <p>I think a lot do. Granted, I live in a red state, but if you get off this propaganda machine website and talk to people in the real world, most dont give a fuck. I went hunting with a group of like 30 folks and not a single person was buying the narrative. Walked Into a gun store by accident with no mask and the guy said you dont have to go get one. I go to the beach and pretty much not a single person is wearing a mask, they use the "I'm at the beach outside" as their excuse.   Most of the servers/bartenders have the mask on under their nose to make corporate happy but they truly dont care. I have, to this day, not seen anyone freak out over someone not wearing masks, and no one has told me to put mine on right when I wear it under my nose 99% of the time. </p>
<p>Get out in the real world and the actual people will tell you a much different story than what the media does.</p>

        <p>I live in the a blue state in the north east. I work and go to the gym still. Trust me masks are enforced here, my manager called the cops on a lady for not wearing one. I got so mad a him and everyone was against me. At the gym if my mask slips while exercising people are very quick to tell me to put one on. We are supposed to wear them while walking around my town and I refuse but I have had multiple people give me looks or tell me to put one on. </p>
<p>I don’t care about wearing a mask to be honest. I hate the enforcement. </p>
<p>Everyone here buys the narrative. I’ve been told I’m on the wrong side for even question it many times </p>
<p>I’m in college but I’m applying to places in the South. It’s not even just corona pushing me over.</p>

        <p>My doomer sister made a post on fb (hubby saw it, I don’t have fb) about taking a “break from fb, because of the drama.” I think this roughly translates to, people are starting to realize this was all bullshit, and she doesn’t want to admit she was wrong.</p>

        <p>In July, my office (in NYC) officially went remote until Labor Day 2021. Today, nearly 9 months from Labor Day 2021, they sent around an email today stating that it was becoming clear that returning to the office by Labor Day was not going to be realistically possible and further guidance would follow in early February.</p>

        <p>As soon as the new vairient was announced on the news I said to my other half, wait and see in a few weeks Boris will announce that it's more deadly. This will never go away until everyone is on thier knees begging for a vaccine. And on thier knees begging for help cos thier livelihoods have been ruined. I live in a small UK town. In the past 6 months we have had about 10 to 15 businesses close. There is nowhere to buy basic clothes like underwear anywhere apart from the big chain dept store we have. So much for helping the small businesses.</p>

        <p>Of course they do and they're absolutely thrilled about it! Literally in Canada and UK actually beg for more lockdowns. In Germany there was ironically protest in the streets for them to be lockdown harder. They love abuse &amp; you just can't help it. It's why I actually encourage people to be selfish. Be selfish or they'll hanker you down with them into sad, bleak, most joyless future.</p>

<p>I wonder if <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/SpiderImAlright/">u/SpiderImAlright</a> needs to know about how you stalk and harass <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/A_n_n_i_e_2_8/">u/A_n_n_i_e_2_8</a>, your history of creating ban evading accounts in order to continue your targeted harassment, including at least three times evading bans at this very sub, as well your part in getting r/redditLiars ,  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Itears/">r/Itears</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/basedshaman/">r/basedshaman</a> shutdown?</p>
<p>Or how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incelswithouthate/">r/incelswithouthate</a> r/goodincel and r/Incelselfie  have set up a bot to automatically delete posts from accounts that are  newer than 10 days old in order to keep you from posting there, since  your accounts are usually dealt with within a few days at the most?</p>
<p>Or maybe he’d like NoNewNormal to be shut down because he ignores this warning, like the moderators of r/redditLiars <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Itears/">r/Itears</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/basedshaman/">r/basedshaman</a> before him.</p>
<p>Look I appreciate you are trying to hide your obsession with stalking people long enough to Karma farm....but a better life plan would be to stop stalking people, rather than continuing this cycle of getting yourself and any sub you post on banned.  Take up a hobby, macrame is nice</p>

        <p>Ohhh buddy looks like you are in for a surprise with me, in fact I expect you to stop responding when you realize you can't back up any of your claims. So let's start we could look at Kansas if you would like, July 3rd they implemented a mask mandate and some counties opted out. The counties that opted out saw their infection rate go up 100% and for counties that listened to the mandate saw their infection rate drop 6%.  Feel free to look up the numbers yourself doesn't but me because I like talking about reality. Any links or <em>evidence</em> of masks not working you'd like to send my way?</p>

        <p>I actually have copious amounts of data. I’ve spent the last 10 months in lockdown with more than enough time to deep dive into almost every facet of this, both scientific and data oriented. </p>
<p>The question is, would providing this to you do any good? I haven’t met or spoken to a single one of you that’s willing to accept these things or change their mind. You may not be that type if person but judging by your condescending attitude it doesn’t seem worth the time.

        <p>Firstly, unless I misspoke, I didn’t say masks don’t WORK to some extent. The problem is that medical grade masks are significantly more effective, to what degree I do not know, but cloth masks which the vast majority of people wear, are muddy at best, and nearly worthless at worst. Obviously, masks have SOME impact on spread. The issue is, there is quite literally no data or studies that demonstrate that they mitigate communal spread, i.e. widespread transmission on a greater scale and in larger communities, etc. </p>
<p>This isn’t even to mention that numerous countries and their medical heads around the world have quite literally advocated against wearing masks. I’d also encourage you to check out this really well-written post about unintended consequences (sourced) regarding masks in particular, but again, that’s not my main focus here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a> </p>
<p>But before I get into data, let’s start with the most integral component surrounding all of this. Case numbers (i.e. infection rates). Quite simply, why do you care? Death rates are what matters, hence flattening the curve which has been done with and without masks, lockdowns, etc. In March, the goal was to flatten the curve, correct? Ensure that hospitals had enough bed space and equipment to prepare for any spikes or overloading of their facilities. For the last 9 months that has been a complete non-issue. Hospitals are not and have not been overrun and certainly won’t by now. </p>
<p>So the initial intention was to flatten the curve right? When was the last time you heard that phrase? I haven’t heard it in months. Because the goalposts have shifted to saving each and every life that could be attributed to COVID. Perhaps some see that as a noble goal. But is it a realistic one? Of course not. This virus is going to spread regardless of what actions are taken. So what is the logic behind rather ineffectively trying to suppress this indefinitely? </p>
<p>And more importantly, what is the ultimate goal with these policies? The goalposts shifted from this sensible strategy to “any covid death is unacceptable and we have to shut down until literally pause society for what will be over a year”, all when hospitals have been and are perfectly prepared and often under regular occupancy now, especially due to pausing elective surgeries in which even more people will die due to being unable to treat much more serious conditions (cancer, heart disease, etc). </p>
<p>Then we have the fun part. The data. I care far more about the lockdowns and their detrimental effects than masks but for the sake of brevity we’ll keep it to this topic alone. Making a second comment for this.</p>

        <p>Sadly a lot of my previous source dump isn’t accessible anymore as Reddit banned the subs I had them on. So much for free speech.</p>
<p>Regardless, here are some:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blacklistednews.com/article/78823/do-mask-mandates-work-new-analysis-suggests-they.html">https://www.blacklistednews.com/article/78823/do-mask-mandates-work-new-analysis-suggests-they.html</a> - comb through this</p>
<p>Arizona: <a href="https://i.redd.it/l4bhcejt0kb61.jpg">https://i.redd.it/l4bhcejt0kb61.jpg</a> </p>
<p>California, where I live, one of the prime examples that literally no policies they have enacted have worked: <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1349112405402374144/photo/1">https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1349112405402374144/photo/1</a> </p>
<p>6-month period: <a href="https://i.redd.it/jrdey82jbm661.jpg">https://i.redd.it/jrdey82jbm661.jpg</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://rationalground.com/more-mask-charts/">https://rationalground.com/more-mask-charts/</a> - this is a good one. I won’t go through all of the different countries but this provides some. Literally none of them have failed to see a resurgence in cases. People touted and praised Japan and all of the others due to mask usage but guess what? They’ve rebounded too. </p>
<p>Do you notice how even if they MIGHT (no direct evidence) contribute to temporary mitigation, there has been a resurgence in almost EVERY single country, regardless of mask usage, compliance, lockdowns, other policies, etc.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I’m sorry. I’m sorry that you’re desperate for someone to blame. I understand the frustration. But these policies don’t work and they never will. </p>
<p>Lastly, let’s check out mask compliance around the world since you seem to think the US is the problem. You may be surprised. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-opinion-coronavirus-global-face-mask-adoption/">https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-opinion-coronavirus-global-face-mask-adoption/</a> - sadly I can’t find the better chart I saw a month or so back as this is a little muddied but you can see that mask compliance in the US is extremely high, higher than the UK and Canada and iirc slightly higher than some Asian countries particularly Vietnam. And in states like California, New York, and other big cities or liberal hot spots (disclaimer: I'm typically pretty liberal myself) the compliance rates are significantly higher. </p>
<p>Again, my focus is not on masks, it’s on lockdowns. I don’t deny that masks may do SOMETHING but the data clearly indicates that the practical effects worldwide, even with the highest compliance have done little-to-nothing whatsoever.</p>

<p>In there you say how masks don't work but if you want to move the goalposts to idk whatever you are moving it to now idc. Do you know why infection rate is important when we talk about an infection spreading rather than just say hey the numbers are higher now than ever before and we have a mask mandate. You also are waving away the amount of people that listen to the mask mandate by saying "it's really high" well sorry buddy in my area mask compliance is really low. Buddy like you sent me opinion pieces and Twitter links. You can't be serious with that can you? Do a little bit of your own research and try to avoid opinion pieces. You can even use Google to only search academic papers!</p>

        <p>I consistently said little to no impact, not that they work. You clearly didn’t read most of my posts. I don’t care about isolated areas of mask compliance. I literally demonstrated rates of mask compliance in the highest countries and again guess what there’s been quite literally no correlation between them and case rates.</p>
<p>Ultimately your set in your beliefs and it is what it is. And for reference I have higher degrees in psychology and data analytics, I’m well aware that I can filter for academic papers. That’s useless here because I’m showing you data, trends, and compliance rates. I can spend all day showing you more data but I really just can’t justify spending more time here. I’ve done it countless times to no avail.</p>

        <p>Calm down come on let's work through this together ok? You showed me an opinion paper on compliance rate. Neither of us should count that as evidence right? So let's talk about infection rate before and after mask mandates came into play. That sounds like the best metric to measure, do you agree?</p>

        <p>Still waiting on your response, just want to point out the irony where you are supporting the painful deaths of 1% of the people that get this. Literally millions of people. Do you understand why it's ironic?</p>

        <p>I have a job and a company to manage. I’ll get back to you later. Regardless of your stance on the number of people that die from covid, who if you reference my posts will have sadly died regardless due to the failure of these policies, wishing death upon innocent people is an entirely different matter.</p>

        <p>Not to mention your death wishes. Does that really seem like an appropriate way to go about these things? I understand you’re likely frustrated and are desperate for an outlet to place blame on but why can’t these things warrant a healthy discussion rather than resorting to anger and wishing death upon people?</p>
