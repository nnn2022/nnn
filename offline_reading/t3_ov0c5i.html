    <strong>Prediction: The Covid 19 virus and it’s variants are frozen pathogens that are being released by Ice melting as part of Global Warming (text below)</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t know much about anything- this is just a thought I had- do not take it as a hypothesis or fact*</p>
<p>I believe Global Warming is a real thing. My experiences in the places I’ve lived over time has brought me to that conclusion. I also have heard through news and classes on Anthropology that there is evidence that pathogens have been released as ice sheets have been melting at a higher rate than before. (Look up a source, this I all gathered from school).</p>
<p>I don’t trust the government, or anything that has a big dollar tag behind it so (related to Covid) - I don’t trust “big pharma”.</p>
<p>I’ve considered throughout the pandemic that all this waste we’re creating by using disposable stuff (and more plastic grocery bags being used, for one) to help keep things sanitary is going to be used as a ploy to reintroduce the concern for Global Warming as more waste enters our oceans. </p>
<p><em>If they push the idea that the virus is escaping via by pathogens coming up from ice as it melts for the first time in thousands of years- then I think they’ll also use that as a reason why the first vaccines didn’t work as well</em></p>
<p>The issue with curbing Global Warming has many facets and I think by encouraging us to use (capitalist) “one use” products, the government will be able to reenforce their  ideology that- its us, the lowly people, who have to curb our usage of such products to lessen Global Warming - rather than rightfully placing the responsibility on the manufacturer.</p>
<p>TLDR: I think as long as they place the blame on something else that gets the public’s eyes off the top 1% (or however you frame it)- we will be doomed to point fingers at each other.</p></p>

        <p>disjointed, incoherent and ridiculous post</p>
<p>frozen pathogens in ice? laughable</p>
<p>man made 'climate change'? absurd</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was thinking out loud when I made this post- so it needs fine tuning. Just something I’ve been thinking about.</p>
