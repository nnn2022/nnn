    <strong>Local “health advisor” says the only way to get people to comply with restrictions is strangle the economy and crash it. Imagine my disgust.</strong>
    <p><p>This local health advisor is a pawn of the Covid scam. She constantly has articles in the news paper and on segments on local TV about how much more strict our lockdown should be. She wants European lockdown curfews, businesses needing permission to be open from local government, and, yes, she said it,, THE DOUBLE MASK RULE. I live in the US and my area has been decreasing in case numbers for 3 months. This lunatic is fear mongering because of the warm weather coming which is prompting people to go outside and actually enjoy their lives. It sucks because the host of the show literally just sits there and barks like a seal at everything she says. She always ends the show with “remember to wear your mask and stop going outside”. I cannot believe this.</p></p>

        <p>These people should have their salaries docked for the duration of any restriction they impose on the population. Perhaps up to 75% for total lockdowns. I wonder how many would still be in favour of restrictions if it hurt them personally.</p>

        <p>The only "health advisors" people need are their own doctors. I trust a doctor who knows me or at least can look at my health history and talk to me one-on-one <em>way</em> more than I trust a government-appointed official.</p>

        <p>If people don't go back to normal by the end of April at most I don't have any hope left, none of this has any teeth. It's all reliant on the people complying with it to help them bring down the economy and the longer it goes on the more lasting damage is done.</p>

        <p>These people realised how scared people got with this and immediately pounced on the opportunity to shove our faces in the mud. It’s predatory and has nothing to do with health, and is very much ruining my health.</p>
