    <strong>“I’ll say I told you so when you’re in the ICU” my brother is trying to push the vaccine on me</strong>
    <p><p>Out of the blue today, my brother texting my mother and I urging us to get the COVID jab. No idea why. When we spoke on the phone, he further elaborated his point by repeatedly saying “when you’re in the ICU i’ll just say I told you so.” My brother and his wife are fully vaccinated, as they were to convinced to get it by their work. But as my SIL phrased it, they did t exactly have a choice. So he’s basically already been forced to get it and now he’s trying the same with us. Same tactics vaccine passport proponents are saying, “when you can’t travel, maybe you’ll consider it.”</p>
<p>I’ve been a lurking member here for a long time. I do not plan on getting the vaccine and I share information here with my mom to help strengthen her stance on not getting it. Simply too many vaccine related deaths for me to be comfortable with. </p>
<p>My mom and I still mask, nothing crazy, just a fabric one with a filter though i’ve slowly gotten more used to not wearing a mask in some places (gym, movie theatre, restaurants, etc). My mom and I have been in multiple airports both domestic and international during the pandemic. We’ve traveled, been to gatherings, and mask whenever we go to highly crowded places like the airport. Not one of us have fallen sick, even though I’m at higher risk for my age group (obese) yet I haven’t gotten it once. My mother has been exposed no less than 5 times at her work, she hasn’t fallen sick once. We have natural immunity at this point. We take the normal precautions of using masks... the vaccine is so pointless. </p>
<p>Is there any hope once your family starts trying to convince you to get the vaxx? Every day I worry about my brother getting a potential side effect injury, even though when him getting the vaxx was entirely unwarranted. He’s young, active, a healthy male. His wife is the same, a young, active, healthy female. They never needed a jab for a virus they have a leg up on surviving. My father has tried the same with my mom, though my dad getting the jab makes more sense (obese, smoker, and he has several medical issues). </p>
<p>At one time, because of my weight, I considered getting it. But the amount of vaccine injury reports and deaths I’ve seen on here, I don’t want it. The lack of studies proving it worthwhile and effective, I don’t want it. It being constantly pushed on me by the gov, by MSM, by my own family and by social media despite all the glaring issues, I don’t want it. </p>
<p>Why is it SO hard for people to understand?</p></p>

        <p>How's your brother's health? In my experience, nearly everyone who gets really pushy about the vaccines has some weird new health issue since they got vaxed. The logic here is simple: they suspect at some deep subconscious level that the vax is the root of the problem; they know it was a mistake; and they can't stand anyone who reminds them of this, by making a different choice.</p>

        <p>thankfully, he has been okay. i’ve seen him 2x since his jab (split moderna/pfizer) and he’s been able to exercise at his same intensity and hasn’t reported anything similar to what i’ve seen others report. but the usual reported side effects he doesn’t have. he got his in march, or somewhere there about so it’s been a bit. i think maybe because he’s had no side effects he’s pushing it thinking we will be fine too but there’s no guarantee with something untested...</p>

        <p>I'm hoping (and praying a little too) that everyone can come out from this mess unscathed. I feel very sad for people who are experiencing side effects. It seems possible that you can get bad side effects from the vaccine and from the virus itself, since the spike protein is what causes problems.</p>
<p>It's very sad. If many people start having really bad health problems in the next few years, I don't know if I'll be able to handle it. That would be enough. But we also have to worry about global tyrants and whatever they want to do with us next.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time for a little dimension jumping, or timeline distortion, or time travel... I'll take any way out at this point. Trying to make the most of every day.</p>

        <p>Maybe you should share this with your brother.... breakout of 346, 74% are fully-vaccinated people with 4 fully-vaccinated in the hospital.  Delta variant is spreading among fully-vaccinated, more than unvaccinated. Scary stuff.  I am so happy I didn't get the vaccine.</p>
