    <strong>Do you think about Reiner Fuelmich?</strong>
    <p><p>What do you know and think about him? Do you think he will accomplish anything with the new Nuremberg trials? Or is he just another scam?</p></p>

        <p>Well he’s not dead yet so he could be controlled opposition but i have noticed that they’ve left a few people out there as the “lunatics” to berate as conspiracy theorists and such.</p>

        <p>I think he has a point and appears to have the right intentions but should definitely be taken with a good grain of salt. There have been several occasions where he stated something that was based on assumptions and not facts which his colleague fortunately almost always corrects (the woman with the horrible hair and hairpin). He's frustrated and motivated and I get where it's coming from, as a professional this should not happen to him though, not while announcing publicly. I find the Dutch party more reliable and fact based than the German committee tbh.</p>
