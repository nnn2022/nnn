    <strong>[Shower thought] The real "variants" they talk about may be the different branches of humans, splitting off from the human gene line, based on the type of DNA upgrades they have received through their covid vaccine/EGT (experimental gene therapy).</strong>
    <p><p>I remember watching a documentary, probably more than 20 year ago, where the premise was that mankind will split into multiple versions, due to genetic modifications (available mostly to the elite, i.e. upgrades, superhumans), so that in the end groups of humans would would drift too far apart from each other genetically to still produce offspring. Like monkeys and men. </p>
<p>I now the first signs of such happening with the genetic covid vaccines, which for all intents and purposes can be considered genetic modifications. </p>
<p>If someone can link me this documentary, or similar theories, that would be great.</p></p>

        <p>The goal of this mass experiment is to find the 1/1,000,000 that upon being exposed to this foreign genetic material, develops a mutation that the elites crave.  Then that poor soul will be disappeared and poked and prodded by scientists for the rest of their life.</p>

        <p>mRNA cannot modify your DNA unless it's administered reverse transcriptase. Get a biology textbook and learn about what you want to talk about before spreading misinformation. </p>
<p>"Molecular Biology of The Cell" by Alberts B. &amp; Others is a great start.</p>

        <p>I had The Cell as my first class in college, 6 weeks straight. I got a 9 out of 10 score. (the book is sitting right behind me in my book shelf as we speak).</p>
<p>The book is outdated, however. It is a lie that reverse-transcriptase only occurs in retroviruses, it is naturally occuring in human cells. Better update your outdated biology world view as well.</p>
<p>https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(20)36678-3/fulltext</p>
<p>This means that mRNA cannot be seen as non-gene modifying by definition (as I also would have done in the past).</p>

<li>
<p>The study is conducted entirely in vitro with purified enzymes and substrates. It doesn't say anything about in vivo situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The eta hpol is not a reverse transcripase, it has retrotrascrittive ability. It is very different. Viral reverse transcriptases do what they do very efficiently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study you mentioned showed that the eta hpol could polymerize starting from a ss or ds primer, it didn't say anything about polymerizing from telomeres or even from spliced ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's no news that we express proteins with retrotranscriptive ability, such as poliA polymerase and telomerase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mRNA specifically, including the ones used in the vaccines, have protection mechanisms (5' cap, 3' poliA) that prevent retrotrascription by rendering them inefficient primers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Said that, I recognize that saying that RNA cannot edit your genome is a bit reductive, but there are still plenty of reasons why it can't happen</p>

        <p>Well, I agree largely on this, that it is less likely than with the viral vector vaccines, which actually do bring DNA into the cell nucleus to work, by definition. Who knows how this DNA is treated there?</p>
<p>Also, I don't subscribe to germ theory of disease anymore, viruses are our own bodily products, cell debris/exosomes, that carry the RNA/DNA, and do all the things they say viruses do, so the whole discussion is actually moot.</p>

        <p>Well, as far as I understand, mRNA, is a gene therapy. That knowledge is pretty well established in the medical industry. </p>
<p>So you're right in saying that it doesn't modify your DNA but it does alter your genes, which is a a strand of DNA. </p>
<p>Gene therapy is hoped that it will help many illnesses such as heart disease and cancer but mRNA is used in the Covid vaccine and taken into consideration the amount of testing thats been done, we should NOT be injecting this into humans.</p>
<p>Some vaccines have been pulled for killed less than 15 people but analysing the reports, we are looking at thousands and if not hundreds of thousands in the future that have fallen victim to the vaccine. </p>
<p>Currently, there are over 4000 Covid vaccine related deaths in the US alone and most go unreported. 
Also, there is also a claim that it causes infertility and yet theres still people denying that fact, even when we don't have the data. </p>
<p>I guess if it kills a few people, it shows it's working, right?</p>

        <p>It doesn't edit your genes. That's what editing DNA means. mRNA is transcribed from DNA by cells in the nucleus to be used as a translator to make proteins. It is continuosly synthetized and has a lifespan of just a few hours. The mRNA in the vaccine, just like any other mRNA in your body, informs your cells on how to make a protein (the spike protein) and tells them to export it to the outside of the cell so that it can cause an immune response.</p>
<p>After the mRNA is destroyed after a few hours, your body will have no knowledge on how to make any viral protein at all.</p>
