    <strong>this is not a covid pandemic, it’s an obesity epidemic</strong>
    <p><p>This is not meant to demonize those who are obese, I just want to have an open discussion. Obesity is one of the biggest factors in COVID hospitalization + death. In my opinion, the government and the media are not talking about this enough. Wouldn’t the logical response be to promote healthy eating + exercise and finally tackle the obesity epidemic head on? You’d think, but instead it’s allllll about the masks + lockdowns and nothing about promoting healthy living. In my opinion, this “pandemic” is really just a disguise for how catastrophic the obesity epidemic has become.</p></p>

        <p>My local government (and democratic governor) actually said exactly this, that people should still go out and exercise outside and use common sense. But this is Colorado, the least obese state, there’s no stopping people from outdoor recreation here.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to eat fresh to eat healthy. At my brokest I ate quinoa/rice in limited portions and cheap frozen vegetables. Even no added salt canned vegetables are fine and don’t deserve the bad rap they get. Some canned vegetables and frozen produce even have more vitamins than fresh because they’re canned or frozen closer to the time they’re picked.</p>

        <p>You’re not wrong. There’s definitely some not fresh staples that are healthy. It’s similar to the you can exercise at home debate , you sure can but the fact that The government is making both of these things harder is laughable.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. It was apparent pretty early on in Italy who exactly was dying from this. It has only been reaffirmed over and over again and its why the US has such a high death toll.</p>
<p>I’m getting sick of people saying “Trump killed 200,000 people”. The only thing he didn’t do that he probably could’ve done more was stress the fact that this shit is killing so many Americans because we are the fattest, most unhealthy country in the world. Instances of obesity and diabetes are insanely high here compared to almost everywhere else and we are paying for it but nobody talks about that because Americans being unhealthy to the max are why healthcare in the US turns a huge profit. </p>
<p>If everyone in America got fit, our healthcare system would probably financially collapse because our unique ailments keep it well funded. Cancer risk is increased by obesity as well and we know what kind of profit cancer centers turn in this country.</p>
<p>It all adds up yet social media has once again put feelings before facts. We can’t talk about obesity because it’s a hard conversation that hurts peoples feelings. People see it as a moral failing because enough people have demonized those who are overweight and essentially made it as such. Nevermind most of our accessible food is made to pack on weight. You have to work hard to find food that doesn’t have hidden shit in it that’ll cause weight gain here. I don’t believe most overweight people have any clue how they got there because it’s insidious in our food. Even shit that should be healthy is packed with sugar and the same items in other countries have half the listed ingredients. It’s baked in to our system of food distribution.</p>
<p>Compound all of the above with lack of affordable access to gyms, and the general laziness of most humans in our non-walkable cities where no one is forced to walk several miles to their jobs and restaurants and leisure activities and you’ve got the United States of obesity. But because the religion of identity politics has deemed obesity as something we aren’t allowed to bring up, this cycle will continue.</p>
<p>Personally I’ve now committed to eating better and exercising and getting my heart rate up each day. This has been a wake up call. I don’t expect anyone else to keep me healthy so I’d better start doing the heavy lifting myself.</p>

        <p>Nope but American gluttony &amp; excess is also pervasive which compounds the issue. “I can eat all this food so I’m gonna because I’m free and I can.” I love American freedom. I don’t believe it should ever be diminished but with that freedom comes the occasional gluttonous side effect.</p>

<p>Spot-on comments. Being European but having partly grown up in the US, the contrast is stark... The impact of the processed food lobby and the unwalkability of most American cities is very corrosive to people's health. Europeans are getting fatter every year, but it's nowhere as endemic as it is in the US.</p>

        <p>Fat shaming doesn't make people thinner, it just leads to yo-yo dieting which causes weight gain. What we could be campaigning for is increased access to and encouragement to use: gyms, hiking and biking trails, recreational sports leagues, the veggie section in the grocery store, farmers markets, talking to your doctor about possible medical causes if you notice you're gaining a lot of weight, and talking to your doctor about possible drug interactions if you're gaining a lot of weight (because many rx drugs mess up your metabolism in ways that can make you gain more weight on the same or less amount of food).</p>

        <p>Because shaming works so well everywhere else, right? I mean, every time someone says you're "literally killing people" by not wearing a mask, it makes you drop what you're doing to put on a mask, right?</p>
<p>(To be clear, I'm not suggesting anyone should be shamed for not wearing a mask. Especially not with the "literally killing people" line. I'm just not with shaming in any circumstance, because I've never heard of a time when it actually worked for anything more than a small number of people. I'm completely with AngryBird0077; increase access, encourage utilization, and perhaps even incentivize good behavior. Probably increasing access to good food is the biggest issue - shitty food is just so goddamn CHEAP and PLENTIFUL, also at least partially because of ridiculous government incentives.)</p>

        <p>The problem is that gym-going requires dedication and discipline, especially if you're the type of person who isn't naturally interested in sports or fitness.</p>
<p>It's a shame that most American cities and suburbs require constant driving, because the easiest way to get people thinking about their physical health is to normalise walking and build it into people's daily routine.</p>
<p>I live in London but used to live in the US and it makes a big difference. Here, no matter where you live you're bound to be walking distance from a huge array of amenities and places of interest. It means you can weave functional walks into your day, like when going to the supermarket or (pre-lockdown) when leaving the office in the evening.</p>
<p>Walking is the most natural form of exercise -- it's what our bodies are perfectly evolved for. Once people are in the habit of doing daily walks they get more energised and motivated, which provides a good baseline should they want to get into fitness or other activities.</p>
<p>But getting to that baseline through gym-going alone is super hard.</p>

        <p>We tried “tackling obesity” and everyone decided it was too hard and too offensive and decided to actually change the definition of healthy so that they fit it and started a big PR campaign about how obesity is actually good. They changed “mindless eating” to “intuitive eating.” They changed “exercise” to eating and called it “self care.” </p>

        <p>The food stamp program BLOWS
my mind. We spend millions of dollars every year on retarded studies to answer “why are poor people so unhealthy?” only to reach the groundbreaking conclusion “poor people are unhealthy because they are so fat“.  Then we spend MORE money on follow-up studies asking “why are poor people so fat?” only to reach the ”fucking duh” conclusion of “b/c poor people eat lots of shitty food” all the while GIVING them unrestricted dollars to buy the shitty food making them fat and sick!!!!</p>
<p>THEN(!!!) libs piss and moan that WE need to give THEM even MORE money to provide free healthcare to the fat / sick poor people who are only fat / sick because of THEIR unrestricted handouts!!! </p>
<p>Dems love to create the problem, shift the blame and then beg for help. Rinse and repeat.   </p>
<p>But I(!) am the cold hearted, uncaring conservative who “hates poor people” because i advocate for severely restricting EBT food purchases to nutritious staples (needless to say, excluding soda, junk food, fast food, energy drinks, etc)  much like the WIC program.  </p>
<p>Many years ago a dessert baker in MA caught shit from local SJW’s when she refused to accept EBT cards at her farmers market stand - her theory was that tax dollars  should only purchase necessities and i quote “no one NEEDS my moon pies.”  I’ll never forget one comment in the article’s thread said something along the lines of “What! She doesn’t think kids poor kids  deserve delicious treats, too!?”  Not tax payer funded treats! Correct.</p>

That would make it more expensive to produce goods filled with refined sugar and carbs, and maybe encourage the development of more products to fill that cheap-food gap that actually have nutritional value.</p>

        <p>I’d be okay upping food stamp allowances if the foods were strictly limited to buying healthy, nutritious foods like you do. I think we’d save in the long run on health care costs if obesity / diabetes began to decline due to healthier diets.  </p>
<p>Also, I imagine as a 6’2” weightlifter you can eat literally in a day what an entire family of 4 might consume (and that’s not a criticism, I’ve just seen weightlifting friends over the years house an incredible amount of food!). And I’d wager to bet you certainly could / can eat more than what a single mom with 3 little kids eat in a day. And with more dependents, allowances are increased. So while $200 might not be quite enough for a beefy weightlifter like yourself, it would get quite a few people by (like myself if I was on the same diet for the  sole reason that I eat substantially less than you do).</p>

        <p>I went to a bar last weekend with my wife.  Guy sitting near us started a conversation.  Turns out he's a virologist.  Unsaid I was on HCQ when it went through my house.  I was the only one not to get it.  He said it might not have been the HCQ but rather my RA that put my immune system on overdrive that saved me from getting it.  </p>
<p>Thought that was interesting.  Weird how all my life shit happens to me for a reason...  I'm still trying to figure out what my purpose on life really is.  I make a fuckload of money, have a great family, and try to be a good person.  Maybe I should get into politics to free the people?  Us that my purpose?  </p>
<p>Or us it the wine thinking for me again?</p>

        <p>I find it very hard to read the judgement here. Modern life is killing us. Exercise used to be built into our lives. We walked a lot and most things were hand made. We live in our cars, driving long commutes only to sit at a desk. The mental stress of the job is palpable. It affects sleep and appetite. Often our jobs require more than 40 hours a week. Some people check their work email constantly or are on call. Carving out time to exercise or cook right means something else has to be given up. </p>
<p>Our food system is designed to cause weight gain. There are huge subsidies for commercial crops. Illinois has some fantastic farmland but most food is imported from other states because our farmers (and corporations) are growing corn and soy with petrochemicals. These subsidies allow giant food manufacturers to produce and sell cheap filler foods that only create disease. For example, they have to add synthetic vitamins to breakfast cereal or severe deficiencies result from consumption. These commodity foods are cheap, easy, and designed to be addictive. The foods are grown in petrochemical laden soils and the products are stripped of the original nutrition and filled with artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives. </p>
<p>Nutrition science can’t even tell us the right answer. It’s funded by these large food or drug corporations. Most of the studies are far from well designed. </p>
<p>Most people do not know how terribly damaging these foods are. Even when they know, they don’t have the time or money to cook differently. Cooking from scratch is time consuming. I’ve lived many years cooking from scratch and working full time. I couldn’t have done it alone. My husband went part time when our kids were born. He does the shopping and most weekday cooking when I’m working. (I was laid off in May)</p>

        <p>Yes! Thank you!! I have been noticing and saying this for a while. The news will report that this tooootally  normal 30 year old guy died all of the sudden from the virus and then they flash the pic and he’s like 400 lbs. I know and hate that this makes me sound like an insensitive monster but it also made me realize (again) that “normal” as in the majority IS overweight and obese in the US. And preventative measures for anything are always downplayed in favor of an elusive cure.</p>

        <p>As usual the pendulum swings too far. We used to view obesity as a moral failure, which is unfair and simplistic. Now we’ve swung the other way and view it as an incurable disease. There’s no question that some people are more prone to obesity (and to overeating) than others, but modifiable habits are also part of it. Genetics can’t explain why the US has become an obese nation in just a couple of generations.</p>

        <p>What can they do though? The government (at least in the UK) do promote healthy eating and exercise and it doesn't work; now they want to go down the nanny state route which seems to be their answer for everything. Now I know...I am pretty fat, I smoke, I probably drink too much. I am regularly reminded of the possible negative health implications to the decisions that I make, however those decisions are mine and mine alone. I have not at any point in my life expected somebody else to take responsibility for my health.</p>

        <p>Back in March/April I was worried for a few weeks. We had a 1 month old newborn and there was a lot of uncertainty.... Then someone on r/videos posted a video from within an Italian hospital. I watched and turned to my wife and said "I think we're going to be fine. Look at this video... they're all fat people over 60!"  Every single person laid up in that Italian hospital was at least 70 lbs overweight and over 60.</p>

        <p>Well,  the biggest factor is age.  And I'm all about attacking that one as well, if you are interested head over to /r/longevity. You can make a fair point that COVID-19 is a disease of age. </p>
<p>But I do agree.  Old and overweight (can we say fat?) are the overwhelming co-factors.  And I speak from experience saying that losing weight when you are also old is a bitch.</p>
<p>My quick story:  About 4 years ago it simply occurred to me that I was at the age where I was going to end up in the hospital with something, sometime.  And the better shape I was in, well the better shape I would be in, if you follow.  It took a little over a year to drop 65 lbs. I started hitting the gym at a maniacal rate.   I'm still over 25 BMI, but my body fat is under 12% so to hell with that. </p>
<p>So now my only real risk factor is age.  My weight is good, my blood pressure is good, my blood sugar is good, my cholesterol is good (none of these were previously true).  I feel like a freakin' genius. </p>
<p>Losing weight and getting in shape are very hard when you are 60+  (it starts getting harder at 40) but it can be done.  But do it when you are younger.  It's cheaper than health insurance.</p>

        <p>We've been in an obesity epidemic for as long as I can remember. The most you'll get out of media is a quick blurb about eating a few more veggies though. It's not in anyone's best financial interests to have a healthy and fit population. Keep people stupid, fat, and lazy, and now you've got a fleet of consumers to buy and ingest whatever you want to sell them.</p>
