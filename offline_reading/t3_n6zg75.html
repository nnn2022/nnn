    <strong>Masks are for branding purposes</strong>
    <p><p>If the MSM and the CDC wanted people to take the Vaccine, they should make it so once you get it you no longer have to wear the mask anymore; but clearly they arent gonna do that because they want to keep the fear and control as long as they can allow it. Hell, if they did that and said "once you get your vaccine shot you no longer need to wear the mask", id be all for that. Ive been in multiple arguments with doomers when i ask them why would we have to wear a mask even if you get vaxxed and they would say "you could still spread" which isnt logical because the whole point of a vaccine is to help your body understand what the virus is. Even when they said it takes about 2 weeks, You still will have wear a mask in shops so.....one must ask. </p>
<p>I dont know how you guys are dealing with this....but my family is basically guilt-tripping me nonstop to get the vaccine because these reasons</p>
<ol>
<li>They think covid is so dangerous and the fact im overweight is gonna make it worse. Yes, i am overweight, but i workout 4 times a week and i rarely eat fast food or anything of that sort.</li>
<li>They think we will get back to normal faster. My family doesnt see the underlying issue that is happening, i even told my mother that they arent gonna not wear masks because its cause so much fear that people have become use to the masks. The other thing is that my parents are scared to death that they will get covid since they are in the older group even tho their in the early 60s, but still.</li>

        <p>Everyone in my family and all my friends see through this bullshit just as much as I do, and I am very grateful I know so many people with working brains. I can escape by spending time with them. I know that's not entirely possible for everybody, though.</p>

        <p>Or you can just not wear the mask. I'm in FL so it's up to the business now. It's hard at first because we've been raised to play nice with others. I've only been asked to put on a mask at Fresh Market. The employee was offering me one with a "mam you'll need to wear this" in a voice normally used on kindergarteners. I dropped my basket on the floor at his feet and walked out without saying a word. Lots of people stared and I hope it gave one or two courage. The mask police didn't mow me down in a hail of bullets, I didn't burst into flames, nor did the hand of God reach through the ceiling and smite me for my "selfish ways". Absolutely nothing happened. I'm so sick of seeing sweaty miserable people (especially the kids) walking around in fear here in the land of free. Just take the damned thing off.</p>
