    <strong>We're All Lepers - Social Distancing &amp; 6 Feet</strong>
    <p><p>If anyone was curious about social distancing and the arbitrary 6 feet, it comes from the Talmud. </p>
<p>CLEANSING OF THE LEPER</p>
<p>Mosaic Law</p>
<p>"In the book of Leviticus, God gave the Israelites guidelines for controlling the disease of leprosy. God provided guidelines in Leviticus 13-14 which would help the priests identify leprosy and know how to respond if and when the man or woman was healed.</p>
<p>When leprosy was identified in a man or woman, he or she had to live alone (Leviticus 13:46). According to Josephus, Jewish lepers were expelled from the city (Josephus, Flavius. The Wars of the Jews 5.227). Everywhere they went they had to shout out loud, “Unclean, unclean!” (Leviticus 13:45). The Talmud required that a leper had to stay six feet (1.8 m) away from other people and 150 ft (45.6 m) when there was wind. According to the Mishnah, anyone who touched a leper, was near a leper, touched anything that a leper had touched, or entered his/her home was ceremonially unclean (Neusner, Jacob. The Mishnah pp. 997-1009). As a result the Jewish rabbis avoided lepers.</p>
<p>It must have been a lonely and a very emotionally painful life for a leper. Imagine the pain that would have occurred when a father or a daughter became a leper and was excluded from the city. How would you feel if you were a leper? How did parents, a wife, or the children feel when they had to talk to a family member six feet way? Also, it must have been difficult to buy goods from another person. The person selling the merchandise would need to drop the item on the ground and then step away before the leper could go and pick it up. If there was a disagreement or a crime committed against a leper, did the local policemen ignore them for fear of being defiled?"</p>
<p>Does any of this sound familiar? We're in a massive global ritual coordinated by the overlords.</p>

        <p>They didn't use "feet" in biblical/talmudic times. All this proves is that modern "bEliEVe in sCIencE" social distancing fanatics are as dumb and hateful and superstitious as the religious fanatics of centuries ago.</p>

        <p>That's the point of the post, though. Society at large is being treated like lepers when it's completely unnecessary.</p>
