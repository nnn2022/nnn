        <p>And not everyone eats or consumes this stuff either. They act like everyone is on a daily diet of hot dogs, cigarettes, and sugar packets. The problem with the vaccine is that we’re being heavily coerced into taking it by powerful entities and are seriously on the cusp of it being mandatory to do anything essential like work. The day the government starts shilling for hot dog consumption; then I might give them up.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is going to be taken by hundreds of millions of people, meaning if it were very dangerous people would notice. This would destroy the reputation of the corporations who made the vaccine. So it wouldn't really be in their interest to distribute a Covid vaccine they already knew was very dangerous.</p>

<p>They may not have any reason to believe it's dangerous and it may very well not be. The point is we don't really know. But it'd also certainly be in their short term financial interests. See the link I included wrt their reputations.</p>

        <p>No the vaccine has been tested in huge trails consisting of tens of thousands of people, with adverse consequences not being too severe. I suppose you could say those trails were rigged but as I said before it wouldn't necessarily be in the corporations long term interests to do this.</p>

        <p>Errr no like I said they would have done the trails to make sure their vaccine was safe enough as to not destroy their reputation, they wouldn't rig them or pretend to do them.</p>
<p>To add to that, the conspiracy that the vaccine is being produced to cause infertility to reduce population literally makes NO sense whatsoever considering that pharmaceutical companies would literally have zero incentive to decrease the population, in fact it would only cause them to have less consumers meaning it would cause less profit.</p>

        <p>Because they've been convinced, like everyone else in the world, that stopping the coronavirus is really important. They think that it's worth the risk of sterilizing people.</p>
<p>That's why they're not trying hide all the negative side effects. They are very open about them. I don't believe there is any malicious intent. They're trying to do the right thing, but I won't let their good intentions ruin my life.</p>

        <p>It's not going to sterilize everyone, it seems like a very small percentage will have that side effect. It just doesn't seem like it's worth the risk since I'm young, healthy, and have already had the virus so I'm already immune for a while.</p>
<p>And I don't think all they care about is profit. Corporations are made up of people. Unless all this is an act, everyone really seems to care about the virus, and so I would be surprised if none of the people at any of these corporations are trying to help the "greater good." We would have no way of knowing either way.</p>

        <p>If you're young, you you won't have to get the vaccine for a while, and by then it will should be clearer whether it is dangerous or not (assuming it isn't known already).</p>
<p>And yes, even 1% getting sterilised by the vaccine would be damage the corporations reputations, considering the vaccine will be take by hundreds of millions of people.</p>

        <p>That’s why they have the no liability clause. No one has said it’s safe except for pfizer. I think you’re right they wouldn’t push something out that will decimate everyone. I’m sure they’ve accepted a small percentage. Survival without damages better be more than 99.97% (like Covid) otherwise anyone making excuses for this vaccine is a hypocrite.</p>

        <p>So actually a relevant counter argument here instead of the special pleading above. The pharmaceutical companies do have no liability clauses legally speaking yet realistically even if the vaccine did have permanent long term effects for 1% of those who take it, that would still be millions of people considering how many people are taking the vaccine, enough to damage these corporations' reputation enough to make lying bad for them in the long term.</p>
<p>The vaccine hasn't just been approved by Pfizer, regulators as well as a study in lancet also examined the vaccine. There are also Moderna and Oxford Union vaccines if you prefer those.</p>

        <p>So? I wouldn't eat that, smoke that, or drink that either. I have no idea what the last pic shows.</p>
<p>The main reason I'm not in line for the vaccine is that I don't need it. I'm 40 and in general good health. Oh, and that the vaccine has been rushed into production.</p>

        <p>The crucial difference: (excepting panel 4 because I have no idea what the fuck I'm looking at)</p>
<p>I can do all of these things long-term and observe the effects firsthand. I can rely on the fact that these things have existed for a long time, and are being 'experimented' with every day by millions of people. I can consume any of these things myself and know that whatever damage they are doing is apt to be incremental and entirely reversible. If any of these things were acutely poisonous, there would be an army of lawyers hitting the companies involved with class action lawsuits (because they lack the legal protections of vaccine manufacturers)</p>
<p>With a vaccine, you have no idea what YOUR personal side-effects will be - potentially life-threatening or brain-damaging - and the industry involved has a track record of putting people's safety below immediate profits. They have media and politicians giving them cover, so they can't be held accountable for problems that arise, and anybody who whistleblows will be roundly ignored, if not smeared.</p>
<p>Vaccines are "one shot" in that most everybody gets them one time, and it's difficult to establish any clear cause-and-effect relationship with side effects, not least because the corporations and governments involved intentionally hide and obfuscate data, and there is nobody on earth with the power to hold them accountable.</p>
<p>I can have hotdogs / redbulls / cigarettes every day for weeks. Ask your doctor about the advisability of doing that with any known vaccine :)</p>

        <p>If we could actually get data on the health of people that want the vaccine vs those who don’t, I can almost guarantee those who don’t are healthier. Seriously, where did they even get the idea this is true? It’s just absurd.</p>

        <p>Junk food = I rarely eats the typical junk food from McDonalds, Burger king and similar. I usually eats food from proper restaurants showing all the ingredients or making my own food at home. But when I first eats on a junk food restaurant, I knows the potential long term effects, ingredients and choose myself if I want to take the risk or not.</p>
<p>I do eat too much sugar, but it's a choice I've taken. If I finds chocolate and cookies enjoyable, then I take the risk.</p>
<p>Smoking = I don't smoke or use any tobacco products.</p>
<p>Energy drinks = I don't drink it.</p>
<p>Alcohol = I don't drink it.</p>
<p>Illegal drugs (E.g. heroin, meth and cocaine) = I don't use these drugs.</p>
<p>I know the potential long term effects because of decades of research and takes my own risks. The vaccine is very new and has been made on less than a year, therefor I don't know the long term risk yet and can't take a fully informed decision yet. :)</p>

        <p>I mean this is a valid point though. I think we should be questioning vaccines just as much as we should be questioning all the toxic shit in so many of our consumer products. It's all part of the same oppression.</p>
