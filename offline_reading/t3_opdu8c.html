        <p>I was heavily downvoted on /r/vegan for holding and defending the position that I wouldn't take the vaccine for several reasons including it not being vegan.</p>
<p>Surprisingly I was neither censored nor banned. I could actually voice my opinion.</p>
<p>But seeing how a lot of other vegans say it is excusable according to the definition that mentions "as long as possible and practicable", there's not much backing from that community in that regard.</p>
<p>To me this line is meant for stuff like not refusing to ride a bus because it has leather interior and not for a miniscule reduction of risk of getting a disease with an extremely high survival chance for otherwise healthy people.</p>
<p>I thought being critical of the pharmaceutic industry would be more common among the people who have experienced first hand that a lot of common "knowledge" is just lies and propaganda by big corporations.</p>
<p>The same politicians not just looking away from the cruelty in animal agriculture but actually fund this with massive subsidies, are suddenly well-meaning people when it comes to human health?</p>
<p>I'd rather say: For those to whom treating animals as objects and a resource for profit is completely normal, it's only a small step to think the same way about humans.</p>

        <p>these are the same people who have a meltdown about other animals that eat meat and want to make carnivores vegan. But it suddenly stop when it comes to a vaccine. Then they just assume you rely on the pharmaceutical companies.. I don’t take no medications.</p>

        <p>A funny argument I got was: "With that logic you must be refusing other pharmaceutical products too!"
And I'm just like: "Well, sure. That's what I do."</p>
<p>My bicycle accident in 2015 was the only time I needed medical assistance since going vegan and even then I didn't use the pain-suppressant they gave me.</p>
<p>When I had the Flu in 2017 I didn't bring the receipt to the apothecary either. Just went to the doctor to prove my sickness to my employer. Cured it by myself.</p>
<p>Not been sick again ever since.</p>

        <p>it’s usually the soy vegans and the ones that rely on a microwave for dinner who says this shit, they really do a good job making people hate vegans. I have had a fever of a 103 and slept it off for a couple of days and I was fine. No medications, i didn’t have any stuffy nose, cough sneeze nothing. I let my body heal itself.</p>

        <p>I don't know if you are familiar with the works of Dr. Colin Campbell. I've seen an interview of him on his book "whole".
The general gist is that the biochemical processes going on in our bodies have such a high complexity, that all the models of it and assumptions of singular causes and cures are outright primitive.</p>
<p>Messing around with something that complex really seems like having a great potential to accidentally ruin something.</p>
<p>A great example are all those psychopharmacological drugs. They inhibit receptors so some enzymes no longer work. Then the body makes more receptors to counteract it, making it to become less effective until you increase the dose. And before you know it there's an addiction. You are no better than before but now also addicted to drugs.</p>
<p>Just as with caffeine (which I also avoid for that reason) but more expensive.</p>

        <p>I was also downvoted and called a shill, not a vegan etc for asking on that sub if any other vegans were against taking it due to these companies track record on animal testing and abuse. I was hoping to find some like minded individuals. But as you mentioned already I found that they want to make predators extinct as it’s supposedly cruel to prey animals.
Like WTF!!??? 🤯 Then I realised that they were actually mentally ill and have no wisdom or understanding about how anything works.</p>
<p>Anyway no idea if it will get an exemption or not but I told my work I wouldn’t be getting it due to my beliefs and they seem to have accepted it.</p>
<p>To be fair my stance on animal issues is what made me know I wouldn’t take the vaccine from day 1 but all the stuff I have found out since has really cemented it.</p>

        <p>Kinda interesting, seems one Judge decided to pencil in "Veganism" as a religion. (Gotta love legislating from the bench)</p>
<p>Ultimately though, still up to the Court at any moment-</p>
<p>https://www.employmentlawmatters.net/2013/01/articles/title-vii/religious-discrimination/one-district-court-finds-that-sincerely-held-belief-of-vegan-employee-may-support-a-religious-discrimination-claim/</p>
<p>This case was decided on specific facts, and does not create a new category of “religious beliefs,” nor does it mean that veganism must be accommodated in every circumstance.  Importantly, the Court added a comment in its opinion that may be critical to the ultimate outcome of the case: “The Court’s ruling in no way addresses what it anticipates as [CCMC’s] justification for its termination of [Chinzera], the safety of patients at Children’s Hospital.  At this juncture, there is simply no evidence before the Court regarding what, if any, contact [Chinzera] might have with patients, and/or what sort of risk her refusal to receive the vaccination could pose in the context of her employment.”  Here, the Court simply ruled on the sufficiency of the religious discrimination claim filed by Chinzera, finding that she alleged beliefs that may deserve legal protection.  The decision is not a determination on the merits of the claims or the defenses.</p>
<p>Kinda like some Courts rule there is a right to bear arms, others say there is not. Roll the dice if ya can afford the Lawyers, I guess.</p>
