        <p>Look at the numerous studies done prior to this psychotic break that showed masks did very little or downright nothing in slowing the transmission of respiratory viruses. It was also known that the small areas they showed any sort of effectiveness was when worn by people who were actually sick and symptomatic, though the level of effectiveness was not highly significant. Everyone wearing masks, on the premise that they all perpetually have covid and don't even know it is some of the most stupid medieval quackery in modern times. It was common sense this time last year that asymptomatic spread is virtually non-existent and the premise that operates on everyone having covid all the time just never knowing when is absolutely absurd. It is horrifyingly Orwellian how the "experts" changed the narrative and literally reprogrammed the public overnight. Just like the Ministry of Truth in 1984.</p>

        <p>&rt;A vile new mantra is on the lips of every public health official and politician in the global campaign to force universal masking on the general public: “there is a growing body of evidence”. </p>
<p>&rt;This propagandistic phrase is a vector designed to achieve five main goals: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give the false impression that a balance of evidence now proves that masks reduce the transmission of COVID-19;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Falsely assimilate commentary made in scientific venues with “evidence”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hide the fact that a decade’s worth of policy-grade evidence proves the opposite: that masks are ineffective with viral respiratory diseases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hide the fact that there is now direct observational proof that cloth masks do not prevent exhalation of clouds of suspended aerosol particles; above, below and through the masks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deter attention away from the considerable known harms and risks due to face masks, applied to entire populations The said harms and risks include that a cloth mask becomes a culture medium for a large variety of bacterial pathogens, and a collector of viral pathogens; given the hot and humid environment and the constant source, where home fabrics are hydrophilic whereas medical masks are hydrophobic. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;In short, I argue: op-eds are not “evidence”, irrelevance does not help, and more bias does not remove bias. <strong>Their mantra of “a growing body of evidence” is a self-serving contrivance that impedes good science and threatens public safety.</strong> I prove that there is no policy-grade evidence to support forced masking on the general population, and that all the latest-decade’s policy-grade evidence points to the opposite: NOT recommending forced masking of the general population. <strong><em>Therefore, the politicians and health authorities are acting without legitimacy and recklessly.</em></strong></p>
