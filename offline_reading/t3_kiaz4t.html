    <strong>How do you explain the success of other countries in mitigating the spread of COVID and the flu by instituting lockdowns, distancing and mask mandates?</strong>
    <p><p>Normal person here, not a scientist, but I follow the recommended precautions because to me they make sense. If these precautions don't work, how are the other countries that have implemented them on a much stricter basis than the USA doing better than the USA at dealing with COVID?</p>
<p>A really solid resource, at least from what I've been presented, is https://tomwoods.com/covid/, shared with me by a commenter below (/u/Bronc27). It includes a number of charts that mark when increased restrictions were made. From what I can tell, cases slow or decrease following many increases in restrictions, with exception to the current spike.</p>

        <p>It’s an illusion in my opinion. All the numbers and data are altered and manipulated. If you turn off the tv and your phone you’d never know there was an active plague killing everyone. It’s beautifully executed propaganda and fear mongering through the media and pretend data. Again just my opinion.</p>

        <p>My greatest friend works as an EMT and did throughout the second and current spike. Her life is very different to pre COVID, and she was constantly ferrying people with COVID to the emergency room. I think a lot of people don't see it because it takes people down so quickly when it's bad and many people have thankfully been staying away from others if they have it. Because of that, all you see are healthy people  when you're out shopping, you wouldn't see the sick and dying.</p>

        <p>I've heard the same from (what I assume to be) your side as well. "My uncle is a cancer surgeon and even though he has to wear two masks to do surgery he says they don't work". Literally an argument I heard last week at work. We're not all immunologists, what other examples can we use?</p>

        <p>It’s a good example of a country constantly being praised for eliminating Covid when it hasn’t.  </p>
<p>https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-current-cases</p>
<p>Also it is summer so seasonal respiratory virus like C19 will be low there at the moment just like Europe had low ‘cases’ during its summer.  </p>
<p>Come it’s winter, NZ will be a different story. Unless vaccines come to rescue first.</p>

        <p>I don't think i ever said that New Zealand eliminated the virus. </p>
<p>Do you actually believe that they have low cases because it is summer in New Zealand and not because of their quarantine restrictions?</p>

        <p>I do believe spread is low in the country as it’s summer.<br>
The quarantine of people entering the country who test positive (around 50 in mandatory quarantine at present.) obviously has an effect reducing this also.
Ultimately I believe NZ a bit unique due to its location, no land borders etc. If you want to say it’s a stand-alone success story, maybe, I’m sceptical as the seasonality etc.   </p>
<p>I know you didn’t say elimination, I was more referring to media reporting of NZ and to the OP.</p>

        <p>I am not an expert on this, so i really don't know how summer affects the virus, it is possible that it helped. Definitely being isolated in a ireland helped. I just find the idea that a quarantine doesn't help a bit weird.</p>
<p>I guess a better example would be comparing vietnam and brazil, both have summer now and both aren't isolated like NZ. </p>
<p>It is ok if you are sceptical, you are allowed to have your opinions on the virus. If you don't trust the numbers or politicians, than that's fine, it probably is really hard to keep track of how many people actually have the virus and politicians in general aren't the best at doing their job. I just find some of the opinions some people have on the virus a bit concerning. </p>
<p>Like there are people who still claim that the virus isn't a thing, because they havent seen it. Which to me is such a dumb and dangerous view to have during a pandemic. I have friends to have had the virus and even though they are young and healthy, it is terrifiying what it can do to a human body.</p>
<p>I would assume that a quarantine wont solve the problem, but it will atleast help. At the end of the day, all i want is to get through this as soon as possible, so that we can go back to normal.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long response.</p>

        <p>That really depends on the country and their culture. I've talked a bit about why I understand Japan was so successful in other comments, but the reasoning seems to follow that COVID restrictions aren't required when cultural norms already include it. Japanese people wear masks normally to avoid spreading diseases like the flu, so they just continued to do that without needing to be told. Americans don't wear masks to avoid spreading the flu, so they weren't going to naturally wear masks to avoid spreading COVID so they needed to be told. Because people aren't following suggestion, it needed enforcement.  </p>
<p>Thou shalt not kill is a suggestion, and most people agree, you probably shouldn't kill people. Murder still happens, so there are laws and enforcements around it.</p>

        <p>We have had lockdowns, mask mandates (since July), and distancing the entire time. Cases keep rising.</p>
<p>Should we all be house arrested and prevented from leaving for food and medical care too? Would that satisfy you finger pointing wankers?  Probably not. Nothing does.</p>

        <p>I'm not suggesting that, ideally I'd like to see country wide restrictions (in the case of the USA). In my opinion because there wasn't an initial, short country wide lockdown people were able to circumvent their states restrictions by going to other states where restrictions weren't present. This led to a whack-a-mole type strategy where only a handful of states are locking down at a time, and they have to lock down harder than they would.  </p>
<p>If I were President, I would institute a country wide lockdown for a single month. Provide aid directly to people so that their businesses don't have to pay them a wage during the lockdown and don't have to fire them. After a month, open back up. If it proved effective, we can try a slightly longer lockdown, with an equivalent aid package. Punishment for breaking lockdown would be loss of aid. If all goes well, spread is limited, no one loses their job, housing, or goes hungry. When does it end? When the country is effectively rid of the disease, and borders are closed until the world catches up to us.</p>

        <p>The same way we explain why states and countries with fewer precautions, lockdowns, and masking are experiencing similar or lower case and death stats.  These measures have little to no impact, compared to climate and seasonal trends.  You can cherry pick "hey this one country matches my narrative" but that's quite unscientific.  Meanwhile all the studies from prior to 2020 concluded that lockdowns and mass quarantines as well as masking were not recommended for lack of efficacy.  Check the CDC and WHO research prior to 2020 on the matter.</p>

        <p>The charts linked in the first source seem to suggest that the mask mandates worked, cases don't rise or they drop dramatically after mandates until the cold season pushes everyone inside and closer together. The commentary says otherwise, but the data they present, especially the chart for Mississippi has this kind of trend</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm assuming based on projected infections. If lockdowns and mask mandates were not instituted, cases would be much higher.</p>

        <p>So states and countries with fewer restrictions that don't have higher case counts (which are themselves a source of confusion for most, since the testing strategy and cycle count greatly impacts what you find) are, what, anomalies? Lies?  Florida and Sweden don't exist? Georgia, South dakota? Lockdowns that happened after cases were already going down did what exactly?</p>
<p>You have this unfalsifiable claim used by conmen. You can't prove your actions did anything, but assure people any changes they saw were a result of the action, and if there was no change, it surely stopped something worse from happening. You can't back it up, and more catastrophic forecasts that didn't occur aren't evidence. You need real world comparisons or mechanistic proof, and it just doesn't exist. Instead all the comparisons show, over and over again, no correlation.</p>

        <p>From a previous reply: In Kansas on July 3rd they implemented a mask mandate as well as increased restrictions to try and stop cases, but they allowed counties in their state to opt out of the mask mandate. Counties that complied with mandate saw a 3% decrease in new cases per 100,000 people while counties that opted out saw a 100% increase in new cases.</p>

        <p>Cool.  In florida, counties without mask mandates are seeing lower cases and mortality.  Now look at the population densities and behavioral patterns.  Also the actual timings, noting diseases propagate slower through lower density populations, and restrictions are almost universally more harsh in city centers.  Check apple mobility data for the areas, were there trends there that might indicate differing behaviors?  How were these areas hit in previous flu seasons?  Does one area have more nursing homes than another?</p>
<p>As always, are the two areas counting "cases" or deaths the same way?  Is there reporting lag?</p>
<p>Prising apart these sorts of correlations and controlling for population factors and behaviors is REALLY HARD.  Assuming it's because of the one factor for which you cherry pick, when you can look across the country to find these disparities, is a serious failing.  "I looked all over for this pattern, and I found it!"</p>
<p>Averaging these sorts of checks across more and more disparate climate, cultural, population, economic, political boundaries decreases (but does not eliminate) the chances that those factors are statistically dominant.  When we do so, we find no correlation between mask mandates or lockdowns and a decrease in cases or deaths.  No amount of "hey I found this one place where...." anecdotes actually becomes significant data.</p>
<p>(Also, now I remember that article.  Cherry picking locations and timings doesn't begin to cover it, and in the end, the areas without masks STILL had lower case counts.  This is not how science works, it is however how clickbait headlines are made.)</p>

        <p>Well first off, that's false.</p>
<p>Second, there are plenty of counter examples.</p>
<p>Japan and Vietnam haven't locked down at all, and they're doing fine.</p>
<p>New York and California had extensive lockdowns, and they are doing terribly.</p>
<p>France has been under a nation wide curfew for months, and it hasn't broken transmission.</p>
<p>Your argument only works if you selectively pick and choose data.  Which of course you, and the Media, are doing.</p>

        <p>Japan is doing just fine because of their culture of responsibility towards others. Beginning 100 years ago, japanese people began wearing masks in response to the 1919 flu pandemic and have continued wearing them to combat respiratory infections. Governments didn't need to tell them to do the thing that they already do. They also did fantastically well because they identified areas of high transmission and suggested people avoid those kind of areas. These were spots like crowded areas, enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, and instances of close contact. Japanese people complied. They instituted suggested lockdowns instead of mandatory ones as well, and people complied instead of lashing out.  </p>
<p>Japan succeeded because the vast majority of their people did the things themselves, on their own, that Americans needed to be mandated to.</p>

        <p>You can say it would be worse had their not been restrictions. You can say the brutal lockdown of New Zealand is a success we should look toward. Then I can respond with Sweden doing better than the US and many harsh lockdown counties of Europe. Then you can say but Spain started to sort of lift some lockdown measures and cases went up. Then I can ask why California is doing so much worse than Florida right now. Then you can say something. Then I can ask why Arizona, Nevada, and California all have near identical charts of cases per 1mil through the months despite having very different mandates and measures on very different dates. </p>

        <p>In Kansas on July 3rd they implemented a mask mandate as well as increased restrictions to try and stop cases, but they allowed counties in their state to opt out of the mask mandate. Counties that complied with mandate saw a 3% decrease in new cases per 100,000 people while counties that opted out saw a 100% increase in new cases.   </p>
<p>Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, all states that have had massive travel restrictions have almost fantastically low cases</p>

        <p>&rt;From what I can tell, cases slow or decrease following many increases in restrictions, with exception to the current spike.</p>
<p>This may be accurate.  But so what?  Is our only measure of success the number of covid cases?</p>
<p>Do we have a graph of how many suicides, overdoses, domestic violence and murders over the same period?  </p>
<p>And again, not every country locked down.  How do these pundits explain Japan and Vietnam for example?</p>

        <p>Suicides, od's, and domestic violence are definitely issues exacerbated by lockdowns, I'd never try to argue against that. How do we solve that? How can we better give Americans the help that they need while also protecting against COVID?  </p>
<p>I talked about Japan in another reply, so I'll paste it here:  </p>
<p>Japan is doing just fine because of their culture of responsibility towards others. Beginning 100 years ago, japanese people began wearing masks in response to the 1919 flu pandemic and have continued wearing them to combat respiratory infections. Governments didn't need to tell them to do the thing that they already do. They also did fantastically well because they identified areas of high transmission and suggested people avoid those kind of areas. These were spots like crowded areas, enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, and instances of close contact. Japanese people complied. They instituted suggested lockdowns instead of mandatory ones as well, and people complied instead of lashing out.  </p>
<p>Japan succeeded because the vast majority of their people did the things themselves, on their own, that Americans needed to be mandated to.</p>

        <p>How do we solve those issues?</p>
<p>By not locking down all of society, and allowing people to choose their own level of risk.</p>
<p>Japan is a good example of a population that has better overall health than our countries as well.</p>
<p>I'm sure we've both noticed the government hasn't made any attempt to try to improve the overall health of the nation (through either exercise or dietary recommendations, such as Vitamin D).</p>
<p>Why hasn't our government made any attempt to improve the overall health of our nation?</p>
<p>Instead, they've done the exact opposite.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay inside (terrible for Vitamin D absorption.  We now know a lack of Vitamin D is associated with worse health outcomes concerning covid-19).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closing the gyms (exercise is an important part of overall health, and will help fight off infection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't see your friends.  (Terrible for both mental and physical health)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wash your hands obsessively (weakens the immune system as it has fewer opportunities to fight off infection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censoring disagreement from professionals who have offered counter examples of how to handle this virus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focusing exclusively and only on a vaccine as treatment, as opposed to something much safer and easier to produce: Vitamin D and Zinc for example.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why is our government not recommending these measures?</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter what they've done.  They either have different cultures already that are openly hostile to human rights or are collectivist/socialist/communist (parts of Asia), or they are trying to become that (UK, Australia).  So they're more receptive to a government demanding that they do certain things.  Despite what some reds in this country believe and want to bring about, that strategy will not work in the U.S.  "Freedom" is not spelled "freedumb".  We have to find a way to exist with the virus without destroying the fabric of our society.</p>

        <p>I know islands in general have strict rules, lockdowns, as islands typically have less resources and many tiny islands have to fly patients out of the country if needing ICU level care and people on islands are typically more compliant because they know about the limitations.  Where as the U.S. has many medical resources available and travel are easier.  I think that’s the difference.</p>

        <p>Islands especially in the Caribbean don’t have good health care available, hospitals.  So, if they even have a few people get sick, they don’t have medical staff or icu level care.  So, if they get a novel virus that could potentially kill people.  They lockdown borders, no one in or out.  And the residents know that if they get sick with even a pneumonia that they may die before they could get appropriate care.  So, it’s a lot easier to stay in place and not get an unknown virus on the island.  At least not until, hospitals on the main land would have beds to accept a transfer.  When hospitals are near capacity, they stop elective transfers.</p>

        <p>Well on an island they do.  I don’t know that I would say lockdowns work everywhere.  It greatly depends on the buy in from people.  Also, you have to provide an income for people and business so that they can afford to stay close.  I don’t think lockdowns work in the U.S. because you have no income if you’re not working, no health insurance, etc.  You have to eat and you can’t eat if you don’t have money.  Unless your a doomsday preper, then you have stock pile of all necessary items to survive the apocalypse.</p>
