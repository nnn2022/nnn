    <strong>Well it was nice while it lasted.</strong>
    <p><p>FULL DISCLOSURE I will freely admit that in Brisbane, Queensland Australia we have been damn "lucky" here. Besides the early months of the insanity breaking out last year, we really haven't been tested much. But thanks to ONE person contracting this thing, the entire city, a place with over 2.5 million people, is now locked down. Mandatory masks, fines for leaving your house (except for "essential workers"), the whole works.</p>
<p>Oh also, 12 hours ago it was just aged care facilities that were being locked down but suddenly the powers that be thought that the healthy young population was in such risk that they threw us in the hole too. So there goes getting the rest of my kids school supplies ready, and we're told it's a 3 day lockdown, hahahahahahaha yeah OK. We all know where that timeline goes</p>
<p>And people here are STILL praising these fools and crucifying anyone who dares question it. It's probably time I get brave and start standing up. Reading the posts here from people in far tougher environments will hopefully be enough fuel for me to take this on and not hide. Let's hope. Lol but of course the major stores remain open because I forgot covid is immune there.</p></p>

        <p>I had started to feel hopeful because it seemed like people were starting to see through it, but then someone sent me a link the other day to other comments from people in this city and Jesus Christ it was HUNDREDS of comments completely supporting this and all my hope was just decimated.</p>
<p>The key needs to be people refusing testing. Refusing testing SHOULD mean they can't claim there are any positive cases (though I'm sure they can just lie and claim they do have positive cases, I'm sure they've already done this).</p>
<p>However if after being shown time and again that these tests are at best barely accurate, then my hope for people here seeing any kind of logic is pretty non existent at this point.</p>

        <p>Sorry correction, it's about 6 active cases. But I bring this to everyone's attention because the same dictator shutting us down for 6 cases is the same tyrant who allowed thousands over the border and allowed a football game with 50,000 people in the stadium to go ahead, while there were about 4 active cases. She's a football fan apparently. So yeah. Makes total sense right????</p>

        <p>Canada is already trying to use you guys as a template for how we should deal with covid.</p>
<p>They're calling it CovidZero. Plan is to do the same thing, complete lockdowns every time anyone catches the virus so we can 'beat' it.</p>
<p>What a joke.</p>

        <p>Yeah. I usually take my infant for a walk twice a day, about 1.5 km on each walk, and I'm terrified to go outside. I usually pass maybe 3 people maximum because I go early in the morning and later in the afternoon, and I don't think I'm scared to deal with any moron who dares tells me to put a mask on, in fact I'm hoping they do because I'd like an opportunity to unload, but I'm scared of police following me and doing God knows what</p>
