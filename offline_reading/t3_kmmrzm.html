        <p>God, can we just get over Covid first before we start shoving this down peoples throats??? </p>
<p>I also think that if society can't handle a virus with a 99.8% survival rate, God forbid we get one that has an IFR of 2-3%. Society would collapse</p>

        <p>This is genuinely the worst part of all of this for me. I have been a hypochondriac about pandemics since I saw some Matt Damon movie that scared the fucking shit out of me like 10 years ago, and I legitimately thought Ebola was gonna fucking murder us all and end civilization because I'm a dumb idiot. And even me, with my incessant worrying for the past decade, realized immediately this was a particularly bad flu and nothing to be alarmed about. I really thought after our "two weeks to flatten the curve" and to get testing up and running, they'd run the tests, get a better hold of the IFR, and everyone would calm down. But it's been a year, we blew our entire load on worrying about flu strain c over here, that when the super airborne aids I've been panicking about in the back of my mind for a decade does come to pass either people don't believe it or we're still stuck on a doomsday fantasy from 2019 and wearing masks to bars instead of doing anything about it. This was the perfect test run for genuine study into how to mitigate and prevent a genuinely apocalyptic pathogen from icing us. It spreads fast, is everywhere, and isn't particularly deadly so we had time to study mitigation protocols or public policy- but we fucking wasted a year doing lockdowns that don't work, wearing masks that don't work, and destroying our economies and the public's goodwill towards actually fixing something instead so that we're even LESS prepared and capable to handle any genuine threat that comes along. What an embarrassment.</p>

        <p>The movie was Contagion. Such an amazing movie that I love and got so pissed when someone tried to use it to strengthen their lockdown argument</p>

        <p>so well put.  the opportunity cost of money, areas of focus and shits to give.   im all for ecology, but i have similar suspicions about the co2, which has its own costs and tradeoffs of other areas we could focus on.   itâ€™s not that we lockdown skeptics are anti science, we are anti bad science and poorly aimed programs that will end us costing us.  i know my blue state is going to tax the shit out of me for many years to make up for this garbage public policy they foisted on me under the guise of being helpful</p>
