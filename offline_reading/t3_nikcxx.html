    <strong>Hey Canadians! What are your plans for the next year or two? Are you going to stay here and fight it out or do you have any plans to move to a country that values freedom more?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking a lot about this and almost considered moving to Texas but just ended up signing a new lease for an apartment for another year. </p>
<p>My plan right now is to see where things are in a year. If we have rolling lockdowns or anything of that sort I am for sure moving out of this country. I'd love to stay and fight but it's a lost cause, we seem to have a liberal uni-party between the liberals and conservatives here with only like 5% of the population who will speak up for freedom, It will probably be decades before any meaningful change in zeitgeist will happen. </p>
<p>Canadians, what are your plans for the near future? where do we go from here as a country? Are we doomed or do you think we can fight this out?</p></p>
