    <strong>Help me against friends !</strong>
    <p><p>So basically I have been called a foil hat, flat earther etc for choosing not to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>It gets thrown into my face that it is on par with thinking 5g causes mind control and Bill Gates wants to chip everyone and apparently theres alot of studies for the last 15years with SARS/Covid.</p>
<p>I took the TBE vaccine when I was 21. Not an issue, so I'm not an "antivaccer".</p>
<p>What can I say when I don't want this vaccine ?</p>
<p>What are the pros and cons ?</p></p>

<p>There's no need to waste your time and energy defending your view. You don't owe them that! If they bother you again, simply ask when last they had a breast/prostate exam, Pap smear and STD test since their private health is your concern. </p>
<p>There are no "pros" to an experimental, rushed, EUA gene therapy particularly since we know what happened in previous coronavirus vaxx trials: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/n0z73c/dont_be_a_ferret_decades_worth_of_research_has/">https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateVaccines/comments/n0z73c/dont_be_a_ferret_decades_worth_of_research_has/</a></p>

        <p>My personal opinion that I've told people is I might consider taking it once all the clinical trials are done. EUA does not equal fully approved. The FDA's own website under each of the vaccine sheets say that they are not approved to prevent it treat covid only that they have been approved under EUA.</p>

        <p>There are no pros of taking the vaccine, it's an experimental poison for an overblown statistically manipulated disease. </p>
<p>If you want to have a proper discussion with them, this sub is full of resources on how the vaccines are loaded with death and side effects, more than any vaccine vaccine in history, how the PCR test is inaccurate and not meant for diagnosing anything,  how Covid is a global scare built with faked numbers of cases (flu and "asymptomatic" I.e. healthy) and deaths from other causes (heart attacks, cancer, flu etc.) and so on. </p>
<p>Personally I just refrain from discussing this issue with people who don't agree and dodge the questions if I can.  Most people are far too brainwashed and they sometimes get angry and defensive if you try to break through their cognitive dissonance. </p>
<p>Try to surround yourself with more like minded friends. If these "friends" can't respect your decision or at least live and let live then they're not your friends at all.</p>

        <p>I had some friends try to push it on me and I more or less told them where to shove it (in a polite way.) they fucked off and stopped. they still consider me a friend but I don’t think I consider them friends.</p>
<p>Once you stop caring what people think, the world becomes a far more beautiful place, and you’ll attract people to you who respect you for who you really are. I only came to this realization recently but it’s very freeing</p>

        <p>If your friends are acting like that, you need better friends. Ditch ‘em.</p>
<p>But here is my schpiel about the vax:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>

        <p>My friend, there are many things that could be said about the experimental vaccine, and why one shouldn't get it. But the ugly truth is those people you call your friends aren't actually interested in facts. If they were, they'd be against this shot as well. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the best thing you or any of us can do, is state our own desire, and use "I" statements. For example,</p>
<p>"I'm not getting the vaccine." </p>
<p>When they respond, "Why come?" You simply say, </p>
<p>"I'm not getting it because I don't want it. I don't want it because I prefer not to get it." Etc.</p>
<p>They literally can't argue with you. Don't give them room to argue. It's pointless. The only person I would risk wasting time on is someone who clearly states that they are on the fence or unsure about the vaccine. Other than that, people have already made up their minds.</p>
