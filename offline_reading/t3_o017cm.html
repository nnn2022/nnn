        <p>&rt;The problem, says Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, is that many of those deaths in the VAERS database were caused by other illnesses that happened around the same time as the immunization and had nothing to do with a vaccine: "Vaccines decrease your risk of COVID-19," Omer notes. "They don't make you immortal."<br>
In fact, COVID-19 vaccines were given first to some of the oldest and sickest people in America. Their risk of dying from COVID was high, but "their risk of mortality due to other causes was also high. In fact, very high," Omer says.<br>
He says it's not surprising that, after administering many millions of doses, a few thousand might coincidentally die soon after getting the vaccine. VAERS is where that data is recorded, and anti-vaccine campaigners then cite the number as people killed by the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don't think many people, if any, are faking side effects. But there are baseline natural death rates that the total population is susceptible to, which anti-vaccine groups are sidelining on purpose.</p>

        <p>Sure, but these pro experimental gene therapy groups are sidelining the very real effects to only talk about the few people on vaers that died of a car crash or something. I mean just look through all the heart attacks yourself. Hundreds of teenagers</p>

        <p>I'm not advocating for sidelining myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation) and pericarditis (heart outer lining inflammation) and pretending that everyone died in a car crash. There are extremists promoting misleading information on both sides of the argument, and preventing people from knowing about potential vaccine adverse effects is information manipulation.</p>
<p>You can see here information on potentially COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html</a></p>
<p>and here for updated list of VAERS reports: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html</a></p>
<p>The issue of myocarditis and pericarditis in teenagers should not be sidelined, but I think we should note in particular that:</p>
<p>&rt;* These reports are rare, given the number of vaccine doses administered, and have been reported after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), particularly in adolescents and young adults.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
* CDC and its partners are actively monitoring these reports, by reviewing data and medical records, to learn more about what happened and to see if there is any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
* Most patients who received care responded well to medicine and rest and quickly felt better.</p>
<p>I think that looking at the information from the source, rather than from anti-vaccination groups, is a less biased and more informed approach to our decision to vaccinate/not vaccinate etc.</p>

        <p>&rt;You conspiracy theorists can’t throw out all of vaers data.</p>
<p>It's really weird to be called a conspiracy theorist. And not all data is created equal. If used properly yes VAERS could be very helpful in identifying possible side effects of a vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;Nobody is faking their side effects. It’s a felony to fake a vaers report. Where your evidence for this supposed crime?</p>
<p>I didn't say they were? But since you brought it up even if it's a federal crime if it's not enforced then it doesn't really matter if it's a felony. And it's a bit difficult to say one is lying about getting sick bc feeling unwell is subjective. So I'm fairly confident no one is enforcing that. </p>
<p>Regardless they don't need to fake one. Again it's subjective you may feel sick after a vaccine, but it doesn't necessarily mean you are sick bc of the vaccine. You could've eaten something that wasn't cooked properly earlier, you might be menstruating, you might have already had a cold that's symptoms are just started to present itself.</p>

        <p>Then why don't we have similar numbers of reports for influenza vaccines? COVID shots have a <em>much</em> higher injury-to-doses ratio than vaccines for flu. If VAERS was being abused (illegally!) by activists, or doctors and nurses were mistakenly counting coincidental illnesses and deaths as vaccine injury, you'd see flu shot injuries highly reported too. Truly coincidental heart attacks or neurological problems are just as likely to happen shortly after a COVID shot as shortly after a flu shot.</p>

<p>Sure, but that's why every report needs a through investigation.  That is the only way to know for sure.</p>

<p>In medicine, a side effect is an effect, whether therapeutic or adverse, that is secondary to the one intended; although the term is predominantly employed to describe adverse effects,</p>

        <p>the first rule of discussion/debate is to agree of definition of words and terms used</p>
<p>i take this shit ass language (modern english) and the definition of it's words seriously, as it is the only direct way to express thought verbally or in writing.</p>
<p>why two words (side and adverse)? because two different meanings, they are not synonyms.</p>
<p>difference in meaning, subtle as it may be, is the difference </p>
<p>are thorns a 'side effect' of a rose? </p>
<p>2 years ago 'vaccine' meant one thing, today it means something else</p>
<p>my RES shows you with +4 up votes from me, </p>
<p>why do you defend their misuse/abuse of language?</p>

        <p>Idk bro I didn’t think it really mattered because to me they mean the same thing. Like in commercials on tv they mention possible side effects including death from the pharmaceuticals. I just assumed you were a covid cultists trying to obfuscate from the larger point. You’re right though sorry for calling you a dunce bro. I’ve had so many people try to tell me it’s not gene therapy and they change the definition of gene therapy. Same kinda thing</p>
