<title>The comments surprised me a bit. More and more everyday people are getting sick and tired of all the bs and I really can’t blame them. Also seen a comment saying ‘most deaths are over 70s and once they’re vaccinated can we reopen’ never actually thought about it like that.</title>

<p>I've heard this comment so many times these past few months.</p>
<p>Usually followed by, "oh well.  I guess we should be careful."</p>
<p>The cognitive dissonance people are experiencing is truly staggering.</p>

<p>Because admitting they were wrong becomes a personal thing, and they can't accept. It. They've tied their feelings to the views they hold</p>

        <p>You'll never see solidarity like that in America. These virtuous assholes don't get that we will never be out of lockdown. Until we do something about it. Ireland is finally seeing what a lot of us saw months ago. They will always find a way to keep us in fear and locked up like good little slaves. Just work and no life. No way to release all your stress. No outlet. It's almost as if they want us weak, depressed, and on the brink of suicide.</p>

        <p>Except the highest awarded comment is this nonsense:</p>
<p>&rt;The Spanish Flu Pandemic lasted for three years, so I told myself when this started out that I needed to be mentally prepared for three years of my life being disrupted. </p>
<p>&rt;I've lost two family members, my wife has lost four and we couldn't go to the funeral. I lost a close family friend who was like an older brother to me a week before Christmas and couldn't attend his funeral either. </p>
<p>&rt;I had open abdominal surgery just shy of two week ago and I've never been so scared to be in a hospital in my life. I've been sat at home more worried about catching COVID then I have been at any point. </p>
<p>&rt;At the same time, I feel like I have the strength to go on. People lived through two World Wars, the war of Independence, Civil War and the Famine and all of these are much worse than COVID. We just need to be patient.</p>
<p>People started getting pissed at the Spanish Flu lockdowns after a year too, and that was a disease where pretty much everybody knew someone who died.</p>
