        <p>There's a bifurcation of society coming that will be shocking. These vaxxed people are dangerous, particularly if they got the Full Monty. Many were given diluted samples, undoubtedly. But a significant minority were given the Full Throttle shot and they are the ones over at r/CovidVaccinated trying to sort out their life because none of the their friends or relatives had bad reactions. See that story all the time.</p>
<p>Speaking of the online, vax-injured infirmary known as r/CovidVaccinated, the comments section over there has become quite the circus. People are getting downvoted for defending the safety of the shot!! And many others are coming to the defense of anyone that gets seriously patronized by a Doomer. I was quite shocked today reading through that sub. Well, I'm always shocked by the stories because that sub truly reads like a Stephen King novel, particularly if you click the flair Side Effects. But the behavior over there is changing and the mods have a world class shitshow to police and sort out. Couldn't happen to a better group of people.</p>
