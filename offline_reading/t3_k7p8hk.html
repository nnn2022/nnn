    <strong>Rona vaccines and risk</strong>
    <p><p>As Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine will be released in the UK this week, I thought it worth sharing a little on the known risk of these vaccines. I realise many people here will not be taking the rona vaccine due to safety concerns, and don't need further convincing. After all, given that the manufacturers won't accept liability, why would you trust it? Given a risk rate so low you cannot produce a statistically significant impact, why would you want to? You may be trying to convince someone for whom a more science research based approach is more helpful though, or you may just be interested in the scientific history. </p>
<p>For that I like to look at the publications on coronavirus vaccines prior to the hysteria and politicisation of 2020. You may have wondered why coronavirus vaccines have never been on the market before, and how it is that they came on to the market so quickly. Both questions are easy to answer. The reality is that it was easy to develop new vaccines that work at a high efficacy because many such vaccines have been developed targeting the same spike proteins (also called S proteins). This is the design used by Pfizer, Moderna, etc. The problem is they have never passed safety testing, safety testing that this year has been rushed and had steps skipped, and from which the data has not been fully provided while the vaccines are already being rolled out. </p>
<p>From a review published in 2019:
"This vaccine could protect monkeys from subsequent homologous SARS-CoV infection, demonstrating highly effective immunization with the S protein... However, full-length S protein-based SARS vaccines may induce harmful immune responses, causing liver damage in the vaccinated animals or enhancing infection after being challenged with homologous SARS-CoV."
https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/1/59/htm</p>
<p>"It was found that ferrets immunized with rMVA-S (particularly ferret 9) developed severe periportal and panlobular mononuclear hepatitis"
https://jvi.asm.org/content/78/22/12672.full</p>
<p>So, at least prior to 2020, these type of vaccines would have come with a risk of liver damage and more severe infection. Now the same sort of vaccine is being rolled out supposedly to protect you from a coronavirus which is only a danger to those who are some combination of old, obese, immuno-compromised or suffering from vascular disease. If you are not fat or immuno-compromised, even if you are old, these sort of vaccines presents a risk whereas the rona does not. If you are fat or immuno-compromised, even though you face some risk from the rona the risks from the vaccine are likely greater to you as your liver and immune system will already be less able to handle the stress of further inflammatory damage. </p>
<p>The bottom line is, do you trust that they solved these historically persistent issues? Do you think they managed to produce new vaccines, in less time than ever, and find them safer faster than ever, despite always failing to produce a safe version without the time constraints in the past? I know my answer, and that I will be doing what I can to ensure I am not in a position to be subject to a mandatory roll out should one come.</p></p>

        <p>There is simply no situation where i would accept a vaccine at this point.</p>

        <p>&rt; people here will not be taking the rona vaccine due to safety concerns </p>
<p>No, for me safety is not the top priority. Use is. And injecting an unknown drug substance which in theory is useless......well, I have absolutely no use for it. I know it's not going to improve my health, is not going make me younger and it has nothing to do with health. So what's the point?</p>
<p>And if you really want to talk about safety every injected vaccine causes damage, theoretically.</p>

        <p>Can't pass a safety test??? Just skip it. It's the same thing.</p>
