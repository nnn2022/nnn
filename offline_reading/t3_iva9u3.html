        <p>yup, this is definitely the worst thing.  Not the fact that people are dying due to a novel virus, the fact that there's a good chance we could have a standing president attempt to incite an insurrection if he loses, or the fact that the Far West is currently on fire.  Nope, wearing a piece of cloth over your face is definitely the worst thing happening right now.</p>

        <p>Thanks for starting with wanting to earnestly ask; it's refreshing to hear someone honestly say they want to talk about things.</p>
<p>Do I think wearing a mask is annoying?  Sure.  However, I think the costs outweigh the benefits.  I've been wearing one for 6 months now, and after month 2 I got kinda used to it, and I think a lot of people did as well.</p>

        <p>Alright, thanks for responding, I thought you weren't going to.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you'd be fine with mask wearing being something that goes on for, potentially, many years then? </p>
<p>Basically, I wonder... Would you be okay with not being able to properly smell things, like a delicious meal being cooked in a restaurant or the fragrance of flowers? Would you be okay with not being able to kiss someone on impulse? Would you be okay not seeing your loved ones (significant other, sibling, parents, friends, etc) smile while you're outside? Is there nothing about being unmasked that you would miss at all?</p>

<p>&rt; Basically, I wonder... Would you be okay with not being able to properly smell things, like a delicious meal being cooked in a restaurant or the fragrance of flowers?</p>
<p>This is also a symptom of Covid, but I understand the point you're driving at.</p>
<p>&rt; Would you be okay not seeing your loved ones (significant other, sibling, parents, friends, etc) smile while you're outside? Is there nothing about being unmasked that you would miss at all?</p>
<p>I had wanted to go to my niece/nephews birthday events this year and I obviously can't.  And I'm still debating internally about traveling over Thanksgiving.  And let's be honest, it really sucks.  Like, a lot.  That being said, it's why development of a good/safe vaccine is so paramount, and keeping the pandemic from running wild is as well.</p>
<p>But, I'd rather have the option to do all those things later than to say YOLO, do it now, and <em>maybe</em> I recover, and even if I do, I probably have long term medical issues.  For example, I bike a lot and like doing a ton of outside things - I want to be able to do them at the same rate/speed and not feel like I'm going to pass out after 5 minutes of vigorous activity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to say it is, I'd rather not take an unnecessary risk for something we don't fully understand.  However, I'm willing to be more risk-averse in the hope that we as people will figure it out and I'll be able to get back to (mostly) business as usual later.</p>

        <p>It's not maybe you recover, you have an overwhelming chance of recovery, assuming your weight doesn't start with a 3 or 4. You e been suckered into believing you will have long term effects. By who, I don't know. There's a reason the only people who talk about long covid are koo koo in the head to begin with.

<p>More like most people will recover, period. The elderly are most at risk, but even this isn't necessarily a death sentence for them either. 80 year olds are testing positive, and making "full recoveries" as well.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you love experts just as much as anyone else.  I would rather have someone who is trained to analyze and determine a course of action vis a vis a pandemic be involved with defeating it vs some guy who believes that maggots comes from rotting meat and who also believes in the 4 humours. </p>

        <p>Again.  You are more than welcome not to get vaccinated if you so decide.  No one is preventing you from self selecting.  On the other hand, social norms will probably require it, so you have to weigh the benefits for yourself.</p>
<p>You're seeing a conspiracy over something I don't think you fully understand.</p>
<p>&rt; it's an agenda, and all the neoliberal power centers are pushing it.</p>

<p>No one's stopping from emigrating to somewhere else.  I thought you didn't like immigrants.  Why do you have the right to take someone's job but no one has the right to come here to potentially compete with you for them?</p>

<p>It's not as rare as you think.  Again, you don't know.  You also don't know how many people you walk by on the street are immunocompromised either.  But that won't stop you from making blanket statements about god knows what.  You have no way of knowing if I am or are not.  So don't guess.  Or, just make the assumption that I am and act accordingly.</p>

<p>It's not just people in nursing homes, though.  It's younger people with asthma, diabetes, who are obese or have heart problems, too.  Do these people not deserve to live?</p>
<p>&rt;Thanks for revealing what you really think about healthcare, but I already knew that you scroungy little fuck.</p>
<p>Nope, that's not what I think about healthcare.  I was just using your logic to apply to it.  That was pretty obvious, I thought, but I'll make that clear here, I guess.  I think healthcare is a right and not a privilege, and everyone should have it.  Just like we should work to protect everyone during this pandemic.</p>

        <p>I back up my arguments with facts.  Just like with the TPP court, I provided actual statements from the agreement.  You just post nonsense from a less than reputable source and call me a liar when you disagree.  That's the difference between us.</p>
<p>How am I a proven liar? Because I made a mistake once and read something incorrectly, which I admitted?  OK.  </p>
<p>The other difference is that I want to protect people.  You clearly don't.</p>

        <p>This is untrue.  I back up my statements with sources.  When you can't win the argument, you move the goalposts.  It's how conversations started as a conversation about masks and moved onto TPP in another thread.</p>
<p>It's not hard for someone arguing in good faith to stay on topic. </p>
<p>I ask again: what was my lie?  The thing I misread and admitted to? A statement I said and conceded I was wrong? Do you think being wrong is the same thing as intentionally lying?</p>
<p>&rt;Your statement from the TPP proved nothing.</p>
<p>It literally proved that your argument that companies could sue for any law that affected profits was wrong.  Or was that a lie that you made?  I have a hard time keeping up with your rationale for certain things sometimes.</p>
<p>Three comments in a row to put together; that doesn't look like crazy redditing at all:</p>
<p>&rt;You don’t want to protect people, you want to exploit people, you’re scum.</p>
<p>I'm literally arguing that we do a number of things to mitigate the number of illnesses and deaths; proven and reasonable actions that have worked in a large number of other countries.  You want to "go back to normal immediately" because you don't like how this all affects <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>That's the difference between you and me.</p>

<p>I read it.  Yes, I misread that one part that talked about new infections (not deaths) averaged the age of 40.  I made a reasonable mistake and I owned up to it.  Why can't you do the same?</p>

        <p>Not at all.  The purpose of the court, as I've said innumerable times, at this point, is to uphold the provisions of the Agreement.  That's the point.  It means that a company can sue another country for relief if the other country makes a law that breaks the treaty.  However, the court needs to give deference to the country if they made the law for one of those particular reasons.  </p>
<p>That's different than "companies can overturn any law that reduces profits."</p>

        <p>The entire thing is a business deal, it’s all business rights. You’re absolutely insane trying to make a draconian deal sound reasonable.</p>
<p>I ask again, do you really think the agreement isn’t mostly corporate investors rights? The corporate court gives them the ability to strike down laws, but yet there is no independent bodies to enforce labor rights. You’re just a slimy low down piece of shit trying to defend ruthless corporate exploitation and domination. Fucking lowest form of life.</p>

<p>I'm not answering your questions until you answer mine.  What specific provision of the deal do you find most troubling if the court would need to make a ruling in regards to it?</p>

        <p>&rt;It’s not true?</p>
<p>Nope.  There are requirements that each country adopt anti-trust laws, certain labor laws, certain individual rights for its citizens, anti-discrimination laws, etc. That's certainly not being entirely business deals.</p>
<p>&rt;You’re nuts, liar fuck you! </p>

<p>You're right; you know nothing about the TPP other than what you want to believe about it, no matter how wrong you are about it.  There's not really a point in debating someone so uninformed.</p>

        <p>The complaint is that for Brunei to get into the TPP, the US and Brunei would be the parties to certify that Brunei is following the laws.</p>
<p>And guess what, if they actually aren't, that's when a country or company could file a grievance with the court and it would be addressed.  </p>

        <p>Over 220 legal and economics experts wrote a letter to congress explaining how the ISDS allows corporations to bring court actions over loosely defined provisions of the treaty. I was exactly correct, it's all designed to give corporations more power. That's not difficult for a person with basic reasoning to figure out, since corporations were a much larger part of the process than public interest groups. </p>
<p>First you lied and said the AFL CIO was for TPP, then when I showed you that was false, you just dismissed it as the union being biased against trade. Meanwhile, you use union members as a shield to argue against single payer healthcare. </p>
<p>You're just a dishonest piece of shit, pure scum, how you could believe any of the shit you say is just beyond my comprehension. You're trying very hard to lie and make the TPP sound reasonable. </p>
<p>Read the letter, it explains exactly why the little wording you posted in the preamble doesn't at all mean what you claim it does. Complete and total dishonesty and insanity as always.</p>

<p>"ISDS grants foreign corporations and investors a special legal privilege: the right to initiate
dispute settlement proceedings against a government for actions that allegedly violate loosely
defined investor rights to seek damages from taxpayers for the corporation’s lost profits.
Essentially, corporations and investors use ISDS to challenge government policies, actions, or
decisions that they allege reduce the value of their investments"</p>

I can do that if you want, but we already had this conversation and you didn't respond much, you just flippantly declared unions as anti trade because they brought this up.</p>

<p>They were clearly wrong.  No laws have been overturned by it.</p>

<p>But again, you've been Chicken Little-ing that all these corporations would overturn laws <em>solely</em> because of profits.  Not only is it: A) Untrue, but B) doesn't happen.  This is why I've been telling you that you're wrong.  Because you are.</p>

<p>The most pro-union thing one can do is. . . join a union.  The fact that you didn't shows that your support of unions is weak, at best.  You've said yourself that you only care about policies that help you, damn other people, so it makes sense.</p>

And if you're going to say it's very rare, you should also know that statistics aren't relevant to the individual; they tell you trends about populations.  I'm aware that nuance isn't your strong suit by any means, but this is stuff that a 9th grader in a basic stats could tell you.</p>

        <p>No.  they got heavily politicized when our President decided he was going to do that, contradict himself, get caught lying about it in interviews, lie some more, and then get a bunch of governors to politicize it even more.  Essentially, what it really comes down to is "do you care more about wearing or mask or whether other people have a better chance of not having major symptoms because you were too selfish to do so?"  The answer seems pretty clear for a lot of people</p>

While yes I’d think people forced to wear them all day would have strong feelings if they’re against masks, so do many of us who work from home.

        <p>But not everyone working from home is wealthy. My spouse is working from home, and we're not rich by any means. He was even furloughed a few months ago, which was terrifying. A lot of people continue to struggle even with their supposedly "cushy" work from home jobs. The only bright side is, yes, not having to wear the stupid mask for 8-9 hours, but I feel much sympathy for those workers who have to. If I could tell them all to remove their masks, and just live life normally, I would.</p>

        <p>So... first the mask are not effective ... then they are recommended because they protect <strong>other</strong> people ... then they protect <strong>you</strong> ... and now they protect you better than a vaccine will?  </p>
<p>That's one hell of a u-turn...</p>

        <p>I’m just trying to understand why life and our well-being is being dictated by a virus that has proven to not be as lethal as we thought. So are we just going to live to try not get sick from now on? We are drastically changing our way of life because we don’t want to get a cough and sniffles? </p>
<p>I miss the times when getting sick was just stay home from work/school to rest for a few days and it was something you didn’t really think about otherwise. Now we are living life to try to never catch a virus again. This is not a life I want to live.</p>
