    <strong>Fuck their "Great Reset" this is OUR Great Reset</strong>
    <p><p>What do I mean by that, I mean it's time for us to reset how our society handles people with different views from the mainstream.</p>
<p>It is my belief that the situation we are in was greatly influenced by the fact that over the past 5-6 years people have felt they needed to hide their real opinions on things if they didn't align with the PC narrative, they feared being fired or 'cancelled'.</p>
<p>Want to vote for Trump? whoops can't say that in front of family or co-workers</p>
<p>Don't think there's great oppresion everywhere? better not say that, I'll be called racist</p>
<p>the list goes on.</p>
<p>The fact that we allowed such an echo-chamber of ideas to exist both online and in our real lives gave rise to the coddled mind. The people who can't handle acceptable levels of death that we're seeing with the covid virus. They want to cancel all of us for opposing their means of getting through this and they see that as the right decision because they haven't heard anyone tell them NO for years.</p>
<p>From now on we need to take a stand and say NO MORE. If you have a different view point it is your obligation to speak it because if you don't we're going to get more of this shit and it's only going to get worse. Never apologize and never back down if you believe in what you stand for, we can not go on like this.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed.  Everything is about protecting feelings.  I decided I'm never going to censor myself again because of others feelings. I don't care if people like me or not and yeah I have lost a lot of friends.  But truth is important. And censoring the truth is where this PC muh feelings crap leads.</p>

        <p>I appreciate you, I'm in the same boat</p>
<p>To keep my head up I always remind myself it's better to live a life of truth and honor with no friends than a life built on lies with all the "friends" in the world.</p>
<p>It's really energizing to know you are being your true self and living with congruence.</p>

        <p>Right.  But definitely difficult at first (it still is difficult I guess losing friends).  I would say it's a different kind of difficult though because restraining yourself is difficult and mentally unhealthy as well. The thing is the whole world thinks we shouldn't be ourselves now because it can make you a social outcast and you can even lose your job or opportunities.  People live in fear to speak what they really feel.  I decided I'm not going to do it anymore.</p>

        <p>I think it’s always a balance. Stepping outside of your comfort zone and not being afraid to speak your mind, but also reading the room and realizing when people might overdose on red pills. When people ask me my opinion or if the subject comes up I try to be honest with what I think. But I also realize some people are babies and can only handle so much at a time before it might upset them or take away from the social occasion.</p>

        <p>Hey nice username. My background is in statistics so it's nice to know there are other data-minded folks around here. I actually have a hunch that we (lockdown skeptics) may very well be overrepresented among statisticians and data scientists, but I haven't noticed anyone speaking up at my university, so who knows.</p>

        <p>Prior to this covid19 bs, I thought that the only people who ended personal relationships over single-issue political differences were the kind whose entire lives revolved around politics. That as long as you stayed away from the tumblr/twitter/academia "sjw" crowd, you'd be fine. It's been incredibly painful to see "normal" people get caught up in the same bullshit way of thinking. I can only hope they will all look back on it like "wtf were we all thinking, let's prioritize what matters in the future instead of turning on each other".</p>

        <p>I actually read an interesting article from an immigrant to America. They claim that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are by and large incredibly kind and empathetic. And having traveled throughout the world, it’s hard to disagree. That’s the insidious way that the mask is to save other people propaganda works so well. It’s plays on many of our basic nature. It doesn’t help that public education and especially college here by and large teach conformity, not critical thinking.  Add on the msm that has nothing to do with news, it exists to give the conforming their base level beliefs. It’s why the npc meme was probably the best representation of a majority of people. It’s hard to blame most, there’s too much responsibility to expect them to spend the time to investigate.  But all of this together makes for a strong control over the general population, to the point that they will be willing to snitch on their neighbors. They believe they are actually helping people doing this. 
That’s why what you say is vital. We will eventually be canceled at subs like this, can’t have wrongthink reach too many. So it’s imperative to spread the word anywhere. Because many countries are starting new lockdowns soon, which, no matter what they say, will be indefinite through flu season.  If Biden wins, that will be our fate. To those who despise trump, look at California Michigan and New York. If you don’t want that in the entire country, don’t vote for Biden.</p>

        <p>On the subject of America I couldn't agree more with immigrant, I was astounded when I visited a few different states.</p>
<p>Americans by and large are the nicest people I've ever met, kinder even than Canadians! The service at restaurants was incredible I had never seen anything like it. Not to mention there's a certain confidence in Americans that I liked, they're not afraid to hold theirs heads up and be proud of themselves and their country, I really respect that.</p>

        <p>It's just that, a "coddled safety bubble." The PC ideology and moral grandstanding, particularly as it pertains to the "black community," is mostly just a big circlejerk. These largely middle class, collede-educated kids from two-parent homes fetishize the hood and claim to speak for "oppressed people," yet they've never actually engaged with these communities in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Because of this, there are certain values that are often learned in these neighborhoods that the supposed "allies" haven't learned in their bubble. One of which being: everybody ain't playin by your rules. Try telling a drug dealer from a housing project that they're "misgendering" someone or what they can/can't say. You'd be lucky to get off with a broken jaw.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is: their rules ONLY apply in the bubble and I think that's what terrifies them. They claim to hate the system but they know deep down, they absolutely need it to protect them because the people at the bottom will eat them alive if they keep rattling the gates of hell.</p>

        <p>The Great Reset should have meant:</p>
<p>-Fixing the corrupt justice system, and making laws fair for everyone. No excuses for being government, or high in the political ladder. Elites have to follow the law just as average joes do.</p>
<p>-Allowing and publishing alternative opinions in the media at least 1/3rd of the airtime as a law to be able to operate as one. Even if you don't want to, you still have to report it.</p>
<p>-Educational, and scientific institutions have to be about science and data.</p>
<p>-No such thing as "Too big to fail". Banks, mega corporations, let them get bankrupt and fail if they have done wrongs. Short term pain, long term gain. Bailouts, if we are doing one should only be for the employees that are in direct jeopardy of losing their homes over this.</p>
<p>-Related to the above, crimes commited by mega corporations should be paid not by the investors/shaders, nor its employees, but the individuals that have committed them.</p>
<p>For example, the CEO, and the management responsible for the Volkswagen fiasco, and the engineers that followed "orders" should have paid for it. Fining the company several billion dollars just hurts the employees working there and will force layoffs. Jailtime and/or fines significant and commensurate to the wealth of the criminal(Say 90% of everything he/she has, not a fixed amount which disproportionately favors the wealthy).</p>

        <p>This is another example of the crazy that exists. The non-caucasian people are treated just as badly if they go against this narrative.</p>
<p>It's not consistent, because its not about race, but to DIVIDE people.</p>
<p>You look at big corporations like Google, Intel and they talk about diversity all the time. Actually you can choose any skin color and they'll be very diverse, because not a single of us have the same experience or come from the same backgrounds.</p>
<p>Propaganda created division can become so bad to create problems such as the hutu/tutu massacre that happened in Ruwanda. 500 years of peace destroyed by 40 years of bad education. Both with the same skin color, by the identity politics standards.</p>

        <p>I think it was President Wilson, after frantically looking for the person who "caused" the stock markets to crash by shorting said afterwards that governments often burn the barn looking to kill the mice.</p>
<p>Sometimes its better for government to leave things alone. Blacks/Whites/Asians/etc will actually get along pretty well by themselves. We all have differences of opinions, often which can be significant, which is the real reason for the clash. It's easy to blame on the skin color as the fault. It's being intellectually lazy.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years africans fought africans, europeans fought europeans and asians fought asians. Hitler killed whites. Their Japanese ally killed asians.</p>

        <p>For practical matters, it isn’t. </p>
<p>If it is a different viewpoint, you respond to it by rebutting their arguments and presenting your own. </p>
<p>If it is just wrong, you respond to it by rebutting it where possible and presenting your supporting arguments and evidence. </p>
<p>If you choose to respond to something which with you disagree, do it in a meaningful way or don’t do it. If you respond by being hateful, insulting, or dehumanizing, you’re just helping make the world a worse place.</p>
<p>Edit: the distinction between having a different viewpoint and being “wrong” is, in practice, a subjective judgment that reflects your biases more than it does anything about the view itself. Right now, there are people who genuinely believe that covid’s IFR is 5% ... and they’d state with perfect sincerity that anyone who disagrees is wrong.</p>

        <p>This nonsense seriously needs to go from these subs. Stop with the political bullshit, the wild conspiracy theories, and mentioning trump altogether. This is a bipartisan issue and it cannot succeed by ostracizing half population of most countries. </p>
<p>I'm not judging on any of these issues. I don't care whether you're right or left, yes some conspiracies are probably true, and of course masks are political, but that shouldn't matter here. We should be finding the things that unite behind common sense and a scientific approach to the covid crisis. If our intro to people curious about anti-mask is end-of-the-world NWO conspiracy stuff or overly political, people are going to bolt and not look back without giving the actual proper arguments any chance.</p>

        <p>The thing is, typically a new echo chamber gets formed, which I see pretty often. Also, almost nobody cares if you’re voting trump, as long as you don’t tell them, if you tell them all the time you are they’ll get annoyed with you, because most people don’t enjoy talking politics at all, especially not with opposing view points. Similar thing about oppression, nobody is gonna call you racist for not thinking that unless you see someone talk about an example of oppression and immediately go “that’s not oppression, oppression doesn’t exist anymore”</p>
<p>Before you say this is proving your point, it’s not since this is me going into an echo chamber in the making and sharing my own opinions that I have formed based on information around me</p>

<p>Also saying tolerance of all ideas creates a new echo-chamber is the dumbest thing I've ever heard, it's literally the antithesis.</p>

        <p>I live near one, and all those points ring true in it as well as in the suburbs, and in the countryside where my grandfather lives for that matter. Are there exceptions? Obviously, but they’re really not that widely spread</p>

        <p>No one is censoring you, just downvoting you, that is a democratic way to allow a sub to maintain hold of the topic at hand and discuss with like minded individuals. </p>
<p>If we just banned you and deleted all your comments then that would be more akin to the echo chambers being created by big tech, you're comment still exists for people to see.</p>
