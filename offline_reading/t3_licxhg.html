    <strong>What is the real reason behind the lockdowns ?</strong>
    <p><p>What do you think ? It’s not because of a virus with a 99.9% survival rate, that’s for sure. But who is benefiting from this and how ? I’m curious to see people’s thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>A LOT of oligarchs have benefited from this - tech companies, Amazon, big retailers. It has essentially wiped out small businesses. And politicians at every level have anointed themselves with a great deal of power and no oversight. Many government employees (LOOKING AT YOU, TEACHERS) are getting the same pay and benefits for reduced hours or not working at all. PLUS crashing the economy was an attempt to get rid of Orange Man Bad. Now they're using it to implement communism and "climate change" under the Great Reset.</p>
<p>Basically, they want to restructure society where they get all the benefits and make sure to keep the hoi polloi far away and contained.</p>

        <p>All of this I agree with, apart from your point about Trump. It’s been just as bad economy-wise everywhere else in the world that’s locked down, and here in the UK we really don’t care about American politics &amp; Trump, so that can’t be the reason everywhere. Just in the US, which hardly accounts for the whole world.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but there have been a TON of populist movements. Trump was representative of that in the US, but there was Brexit in the UK, yellow jackets in France, the antimigrant protests in Germany. Even the Free Hong Kong protests in China. This was used to clamp down on regular people, everywhere. (It failed to stop Brexit, but they tried, bless their hearts.)</p>

        <p>It’s a test. What will we bend the knee to. Lockdowns. Curfews. Masks. Two masks. Vaccines. Limited travel. No live music. No live sports for the most part. Distance learning. Then add in the massive wealth transfer .. the largest in world history. Then wall st getting played by retail traders.. that’s gonna lead to stake holders instead of share holders. What will we bend the knee to? How far can they push us? Slowly they gather that info. 2022 is going to be worse than whatever you think is worst case right now.</p>

        <p>It's the age-old expression, "never let a good crisis go to waste."</p>
<p>After thinking about this for months and trying to make sense of it, I've come to the conclusion that there is no single reason or driving force behind what you're seeing. Instead, what you have is a collection of individuals, groups, and ideologies working to further their own interests by using this virus to their advantage.</p>
<p>Let me provide some examples. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Doctors and experts who have seen others elevated to a celebrity status are after their 15 minutes of fame are more than happy to say whatever it takes to get on TV or get Twitter followers. They don't want this to end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media, having been on a downward trend for a long time now, is grasping at this with all its might because it's become relevant again, for the first time in a long time. They have a vested interest in keeping this going. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China is more than happy to encourage this and watch the collapse of every other economy in the world, allowing them to continue their economic domination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WEF is likewise ecstatic that they can finally push their plans for a reset on the back of this virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spineless politicians are happy to defer to public health to save themselves the ire of the media and the angry mob. And then there are those who have always had controlling tendencies, who have been granted an opportunity to enact them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every politician or political entity is looking for a way to make this work for themselves. Mail in voting? Delayed elections? Just look at how the Democrats were happy to milk the virus for all it was worth to get Trump out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the giant corporations like Amazon, they are getting filthy rich over this. Social media companies are happy too - since people can't meet in person they have to use their channels to communicate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't think I need to elaborate on why big pharma is ecstatic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unions, whose job it has now been for a long time to try and get as much money for as little work as possible, well they are more than happy to get their fair shake from this. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every single "Karen" (and I hate using that term) who used to get shamed for being the way they are, are now getting praised for their "righteous" behavior. They are reveling in this crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same can be said for all the virtue signalers, all the SJWs, who have found themselves in a perfect environment to show everybody what amazing people they are. All the virtue signaling admit masks and vaccines right here on this site should be enough to prove that they don't want it to end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the lonely outcast person who got made fun of their entire life for being antisocial, for never interacting with others. Now their way of life is assumed to be not just correct, but saving lives. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every lazy bum who wants to sit around and collect government money instead of working is more than happy for this to continue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so and so on. It's a collection of different interest groups all trying to make the best of this for themselves. And unfortunately they don't care if they trample over the rest of us in the process.</p>

        <p>After almost a year we can see how insignificant this virus is. Lockdowns are bs. I think if people are really scared they can stay home but should not be mandated. I DJed New Year’s Eve at a small casino and there were more little old ladies than anyone else. They’d rather be out living their lives and so should everyone else.</p>

        <p>II think all these mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns are happening because most politicians need to be elected every x years, and/or need to keep up a good public image in order to stay relevant in politics. One of the worst things a politican can be seen doing, is nothing - even if by doing something, they're making things worse. Just look at the way people and the media try to drag Noem and DeSantis through the mud at every turn.</p>
<p>Plus, by implementing all these things, you can virtue signal and claim that you just care sooooo much about people, just like all these big corporations are doing as well. You'll get tons of praise by media and social media too. Best part is, if it doesn't help things, you can always just point the finger at the people and say that the reason it failed is because of them and they need to do better.</p>
<p>Then there are all the politicians who don't need to worry about being elected who obviously don't really need to give a rat's ass about their people's overall well-being and love a good excuse for a power-grab.</p>

        <p>I have several theories on this. </p>
<p><strong>Trump</strong></p>
<p>Love him or hate him, Trump was a populist/nationalist president, and he rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because he spoke his mind, and he put America first. The establishment has a plan for the United States, Trump was the hurdle. Notice the news once he ran for president, and during president. Trump defeated Hillary, this put a huge dent into the establishments plan: more war in the middle east, TPP, possible war with Russia, regime changes in the middle east. Now that Trump is out of the way because of voter fraud, the establishment can implement their little plan!</p>
<p><strong>Government Consolidation of Power</strong></p>
<p>At least here in the States, State and local governments have been issuing decrees, mandates, executive orders like they're going out of style. These governments have been abusing the power that was meant to be temporary, and are making these mandates permanent (see mask mandates, curfews, etc.). Now that the precedent has been set, governments will abuse this power under the guise of "safety." Think of it as the TSA security theater; name one terrorist the TSA has caught? The answer? Zero!</p>
<p><strong>Follow the Money</strong></p>
<p>The biggest thing from all this? Who has benefited from this? Just follow the money! Big pharmaceutical companies, large consumer corporations (Wal-Mart, Target, Amazon, Uber) have benefited greatly from the lockdown. Look at their record profits. There's a reason why State and local governments closed down local businesses, and it was make sure that the large corporations raked in the money so that they can come out the winners, while mom-and-pop shops come out the losers. The result? Knock out the middle class, and they come poor, destitute and reliant on the government.</p>
<p><strong>The Media</strong></p>
<p>The mainstream media is controlled, at least here in America, by a just a handful of people. The media now is a propaganda arm of the thugs that run the government, control the money supply, corporations and elite, so there is a concerted effort by the media to instill fear, uncertainty and doubt into the minds of the American people. If they can spread enough fear, they can control the population through fear. They have introduced a concept called problem, reaction, and solution. Of course, the subliminal programming is dependent on the populace glued to their televisions, radio stations, and the internet. So it is not a coincidence that they have encouraged people to "stay home" for your safety. Because when you are home, what is the very thing people have commonly in their homes or on them? Televisions, computers, cell phones and tablets. So now you can force people, indirectly, to watch propaganda 24/7 without even having to explicitly telling them to watch it. People will tune in because of natural curiosity, and wanting to know.</p>
<p><strong>Control and Enslavement</strong></p>
<p>The end game? It is your enslavement. How do we know this? Look at the policies, and news cycles. You see a lot of people doing as the government and media been telling them to do. Staying home courtesy of house arrest (of course, they're not calling it this), restricting people's movements, telling you when you can, and can not work, restricting congregating. Of course, if you want to bring in tyranny, you do it in bits and pieces. Notice, it was, shut down for two weeks, we need to protect the hospitals. Then it was, wear the masks for two weeks, we need to flatten the curve. To then, it was in order to protect grand ma and pappy we need shutdown everything because you're being selfish we don't.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction of Technocracy</strong></p>
<p>Remember that guy you voted for local, State and Federal elections? Guess what? He's just a figured head! The real power is going to be in the hands of the front men technocrats (Gates, Fauci, Birx, etc.). Whatever they say goes, such masks, when you can come out of house arrest, when your business can open, when you can go back to school, when and where you get your vaccine, etc. This whole pandemic is basically the transfer of power from federalism to fascism.</p>
<p>A little note on history from NAZI Germany</p>
<p>Remember, that everything that Hitler and the NAZIS did was legal under German law. I'll repeat it again, everything that Hitler and the NAZIS did was legal under German law. The courts condoned it, the media applauded it, the average German ignored or allowed it, and by the time the NAZIS eliminated all their enemies, they went after the people who were against the NAZIS or suspected to be. By then, it was too late, and of course, well history speaks for itself as to what happened. </p>
<p>Now, compare it to what is happening now here in the United States. Most of what the State governors, or local governments are doing is legal under United States law or is being allowed by the courts, applauded by the media, the average American is ignoring or allowing, being allowed by the courts and people opposing this are being vilified. Guess what comes next once the government has the numbers? Let that sink in!</p>

        <p>There is no response to this that is true that would make you happy. If you believe in an illuminati-esque government that's controlling your life and brainwashing society there's not much more to it. Maybe you need a shock, because the vast majority are not going entertain your ideas.</p>
<p>There's many reasons to follow guidelines but hey, you can't handle home college life so it's automatically a conspiracy.</p>

        <p>All good! I get your sentiments, I do. But I think this was a lot more easy for people who saw this coming post-9/11 to stop and be like “ah, so here we are” than people who have always just called the other group conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>It’s a hard pill to swallow if you’ve never once in your life explored the possibility that things aren’t as they seem. And it’s a deeply woven puzzle that can be put together stemming back from literally the 60s. It makes a lot more sense when you spend the time to research it and realize just how fucking corrupt the government is. Then, only then, does all of this make perfect sense.</p>
<p>ETA: yes, this goes beyond the 60s. I just meant that’s when you start to find glaring examples of how the government and it’s institutions absolutely DO NOT have the people’s’ best interests at heart.</p>

        <p>I know every government has corruption issues but this is akin to flat earth or the moon landing. It requires an all-clever and all-powerful multi-government network when at the same time they believe the government is incapable of running a socialized health program. It doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Also, I do get WHY people think this way but it's still dumb when you know boomers and patriots here would 100% support drafting, and they don't have a problem with controlling the population's lives and disrupting the status quo then?</p>

        <p>Incapable of running a health programme ? They absolutely are capable. Unwilling to put funds into it, and unwilling ? Yeah. I don’t know why you blindly trust the government. It’s very much possible for such a network to exist. Drafting is different than turning everyone’s lives tits up for NO REASON.</p>

<p>It is laughable you believe with all the inter-country conflicts there are that suddenly every country has banded together to crackdown on democracy and freedom.</p>
<p>And it's not for no reason. In the time of the plague people understood the need to isolate. Heard of a town called Eyam which isolated in 1665 due to the plague? Its embarrassing you know less than them.</p>
<p>How did ebola end? By isolating. Maybe you'll have took it more serious if the death rate had been 50%. Or severely harmed teenagers. Sounds scarier doesn't it?</p>
