    <strong>I’m sick of the “no shoes, no shirt, no service” mask argument</strong>
    <p><p>It seems the new catch phrase for the zombie apocalypse doomers is comparing mask regulations to the “no shirt, no shoes, no service” regulation.  I agree that there’s a time and place for masks. But not everyone/everywhere/every time needs one. This mask mandate has to end soon. </p>
<p>However, there are some that will argue with you that having stores, government, whatever make you wear one, is like the no shirt policy. “They make you wear pants”, etc.</p>
<p>Or the other argument of seat belts. By law you have to wear seatbelts. So therefore by law they should be able to make you wear masks. </p>
<p>Well, here’s my argument against all that. And it’s simple. </p>
<p>Non of the arguments advocating for mandatory national masks took place overnight.  They all took years of very slow acceptance and implementation. Cars were invented over 100 years ago, seatbelts weren’t even mandatory until 1968. State laws for mandatory wearing them didn’t start really getting going until the mid 80’s to early 90’s. 
And there was a long time we’re going shoeless or shirtless was normal. Again it took many years of slow progression to when it became the norm no deny service for not having them. </p>
<p>Covid made this mask thing appear overnight.  A sudden abrupt change. Karen’s and Kens who think most of humanity can make that big a change to their way of life is what is maddening.  Maybe some can do it, but i cannot.</p></p>

        <p>There's some kind of drunk driving analogy people keep trying to make as well. I guess the point is that you might be fine but your actions can kill someone. But for that analogy to work, we would ban everyone from driving due to the fear that anyone could be secretly drunk.</p>

        <p>Or a better idea, if you're that sick, just stay home for a few days till you feel better. But in reality, it is absolutely nothing like drunk driving...because humans are just natural carriers of viruses and bacteria. Apparently, they think covid is the only pathogen to ever exist.  We have a microbiome of thousands of kinds of viruses and bacteria on and in us at all times, and we wouldn't be alive without it. And furthermore, mild viruses have been spreading among humans for as long as we've existed.  It's why we got sick with colds in school every year.  It's always been a normal part of existence, and never been a big deal...until this mass psychosis phenomenon this year. Unknowingly spreading a mild respiratory virus is not the equivalent of negligent homicide or manslaughter, like drunk or reckless driving is. Before March of this year, this was understood. People caught colds and flus all the time, and no one called anyone a murderer, or made invalid analogies/stupid comparisons about the spread of mild viruses. But somehow in March of this year, the whole world had a massive psychotic break.</p>

        <p>Well said. I agree there’s some mass psychosis going on. A doomer on another sub asked me if I would consider it an attack if someone transmitted Covid to me. I said absolutely not (unless it was planned). He proceeded to try to convince me that I SHOULD consider it an attack. Sorry, not buying into this twisted new Covid morality.</p>

        <p>And that's not even all that is inaccurate about those "masks are the new xy" comparisons. We wear a seatbelt when driving a car to protect us from uncontrollable situations that may happen. Mechanical failure, other drivers crashing into us etc. </p>

<p>Masks are for the protection of yourself, but mostly for others. It prevents particulates from leaving your mouth or nose and getting airborne around others. </p>

<p>The difference is that some pathogens are more consequential than others, and therefore merit a different reaction.</p>

        <p>Different reaction, to me, would mean being more careful with hygiene, staying at home when sick, and perhaps avoiding large crowds. That would be proportionate to the threat. These batshit restrictions go way beyond reasonable.</p>

        <p>But if you look at the actual death rate and how many are totally fine, covid is not one of those.  That's why countries that took very few precautions, like Japan, are totally fine and ended their states of emergency already.</p>

        <p>Covid virions are too small to be blocked by masks, and the one actual research study that has ever been done for any virus protection with cloth masks found the wearers of cloth masks got sick MORE often than those without masks.  If the powers that be REALLY wanted to stop spread, they'd be ramping productios of masks that at least have been proven to work instead of pushing cloth that doesn't.  It's been months now, way too much time to be still pushing cloth masks.  That alone is highly suspicious.</p>

        <p>I guess you are going to ignore my comment about the only actual research study done on cloth masks showed them to be worse than no mask for virus.  No research shows any benefit to large droplet blockage that cloth masks do either because large drops do not fly from one mouth to another and small drops are not blocked by masks.  Just because the media repeats something does not make it true, any actual scientist is very familiar with how often newscasters get it wrong.  Right now media is just repeating an assumption that is not based on any science: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/data-do-not-back-cloth-masks-limit-covid-19-experts-say</p>

        <p>&rt;And since i've been talking about cloth masks from the start of this thread and questioning why they are still pushing those</p>
<p>A few reasons. Lots of cloth masks (mine included) have pouches for filters which means they filter better. Additionally, you can buy ones that aren't so thin they let things through easily. They're also meant to be washed frequently or at least exchanged with other cloth masks so you're not wearing an old one every day. So if you follow those guidelines, [most of which are explicitly endorsed by the CDC](<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html]">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html</a> ), you should be better off.</p>
<p>Let's get to your study, which I took some time to look through. First things first, it is about health care workers <em>in high-risk wards in Vietnam</em> who, and I quote:</p>
<p>&rt;were in contact with 36 patients per day during the trial period</p>
<p>Ok. Cool. So we're already dealing with a high-viral-load population. Added to this:</p>
<p>&rt;A limitation of this study is that we did not measure compliance with hand hygiene, and the results reflect self-reported compliance, which may be subject to recall or other types of bias.... In addition, the quality of paper and cloth masks varies widely around the world, so the results may not be generalisable to all settings.</p>
<p>Ok, so they didn't measure hand-washing compliance, and it seems like they didn't measure quality of masks since they're acknowledging that the quality varies and may not be applicable to other masks. Also:</p>
<p>&rt;Cloth masks are generally retained long term and reused multiple times, with a variety of cleaning methods and widely different intervals of cleaning. Further studies are required to determine if variations in frequency and type of cleaning affect the efficacy of cloth masks.</p>
<p>So they didn't measure or control for the cleaning of the masks, and they seem to implicitly acknowledge the cloth masks may have been worn multiple times.</p>
<p>So, to recap the limitations of that study:</p>
<p>- They measured a population that already is going to be exposed repeatedly to pathogens as part of their workplace</p>
<p>- They didn't measure hand-washing frequency, cloth mask quality, or cloth mask washing frequency</p>
<p>- Their control group included mask-wearing, and they address it by saying: "Another limitation of this study is the lack of a no-mask control group and the high use of masks in the controls, which makes interpretation of the results more difficult"</p>
<p>So lets get back to what you claim this study shows:</p>
<p>&rt;the only actual research study done on cloth masks showed them to be worse than no mask for virus</p>
<p>I can tell you didn't read this study. They state <strong>explicitly</strong> in the "strengths and limitations" near the beginning of the study in a <strong>BULLET POINT LIST</strong> that they didn't <em>have</em> a "no mask" group.</p>
<p>What they showed was that cloth mask-wearing healthcare workers that were not tested for hygienic practices or mask quality showed worse outcomes than medical mask wearers and a control group that consisted of a grab-bag of mask-wearing practices (" In the control arm, 170/458 (37%) used medical masks, 38/458 (8%) used cloth masks, and 245/458 (53%) used a combination of both medical and cloth masks during the study period. <strong>The remaining 1% either reported using a N95 respirator (n=3) or did not use any masks (n=2)."</strong>)</p>
<p>This study does not provide definitive proof of what you claim it does. In fact, it doesn't even have a <em>measurement</em> for what you claim it does.</p>
<p>&rt;questioning why they are still pushing those vs ramping up production and distribution of other masks still now months and months later if they are so worried about actual transmission</p>
<p>Because the CDC has already laid out instructions for how to take care of your re-usable mask, and this study didn't account for the very hygiene the CDC is stressing.</p>
<p>Read a goddamn study if you're going to link it as evidence. You're embarrassing yourself and you're wasting my fucking time.</p>

        <p>It's great they did not enforce hand hygiene, the goal is to study masks, not hand washing, and this makes it more realistic but all that being said, they were nurses so they probably all had to wash hands fairly often since hospitals do make you do that kind of thing when you work there.  I have yet to see any decent segment of the population using supplemental filters so that is not relevant to the current situation.  Most peeps are just doing whatever, some wash masks, many don't, so again the study is similar to the current situation.  The control group and all the groups still did wear masks during surgery when it was required but only then, so that could weaken differences between the arms of the study that is true, but yet an effect was still found, that just means the effect may have been stronger if the no mask group was doing no mask 100 percent of the time allowing greater diffs between the groups.  Also I never claimed the study was PROOF of anything, that's your invention, I only said that the one and only study ever to test cloth masks found that the cloth mask arm of the study was worse off.  Also yes please continue to insult me as much as possible because I am sure that will convince me of your argument really fast, good job dude, keep up the good work and happy days to you too!!  :-)</p>

<p>You don’t get to back off this. This is what you said:</p>
<p>&rt; the only actual research study done on cloth masks showed them to be worse than no mask for virus</p>
<p>It’s so weasley to pretend you weren’t holding up this study as evidence that masks are worse by pointing out you didn’t use the word “proof”. You used this study as evidence for a claim. You said it “showed them to be worse”. Own it and say you were wrong like a grown-up; the study didn’t measure non-mask wearing, and didn’t take into account important variables that would likely affect outcomes. They <em>explicitly say so themselves</em> that the data may not be broadly applicable, yet you’re applying it broadly.</p>
<p>&rt; Also yes please continue to insult me as much as possible because I am sure that will convince me of your argument really fast, good job dude, keep up the good work and happy days to you too!!  :-)</p>
<p>Did this study look at a “no mask” group, or did it not?</p>
<p>It didn’t. It says so in the opening, yet you used it as evidence for your claim that no masks are better than cloth masks. </p>
<p>That’s an embarassing lapse in judgement. </p>
<p>You acted as if facts were all that mattered right up until I read the study, and now that I’ve pointed out your study doesn’t say what you claimed it did suddenly it’s about how me hurting your feelings won’t convince you. </p>
<p>Grow up. </p>
<p>Honestly at this point I’m tired of repeatedly pointing out how fucking lazy you’re being with your reasoning and reading. I’m going to bed. </p>
<p>Feel free to use your 1 study from Vietnam about rhinovirus to support your pre-existing disdain for putting on a mask. I don’t care at this point. If you’re the kind of person that can’t be bothered to do something for others that minor, I don’t think I could convince you of anything you didn’t already want to do anyway.</p>

        <p>That's your opinion. FYI, the primary form of transmission is not airborne, it's droplets.

        <p>What about Gay wedding cakes?  That's a pretty good comparison.  Conservatives didn't want a store owner to have to serve people that offended their faith and were fine with that.

        <p>The canned response to that (and any comparison to the protests) is a very indignant scoff and something along the lines of “you really think such and such compares to such and such?” Not worth making them eat their own hypocrisy, because they don’t see it as such. And to be fair, assuming they were against the cake business or for protests and then using that in your argument is somewhat weak.</p>

        <p>Wearing seat belts shouldn't be mandatory either. Not that I suggest people stop wearing them; unlike masks, they're proven to be effective. But I still don't think it's the government's place to tell people what risks they can take with their own life.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I am so sick of the false equivalencies and invalid analogies. The comparisons are completely nonsensical, forget apples and oranges. This is more like comparing a dog to a pencil. The most horrifying thing of all is how quickly the masses were programmed to normalize masks. I'm sick of having to list the many reasons (which should be obvious to any normal human being) why masks are detrimental and dehumanizing, and the most visible sign of this dystopian nightmare. Six months ago they would have never given a half second thought to wearing them. Now they act like they love them and that it should be just as normal and socially acceptable as wearing a shirt or shoes in public. The fact that an uncovered human face is now considered dangerous, shameful, taboo, and the fact that going out with a mask is now subversive should be terrifying enough and clear proof of how quickly this has become a dystopia.</p>

        <p>Seatbelts are for the public good, not an individual choice.  The costs to everyone else in insurance, injury, long term care, and death through the act of not wearing a seatbelt far outweigh the individuals right to avoid a minor inconvenience.  Seatbelts are a great example in my mind.  Cars are safer because of Seatbelts, which is equivalent to social distancing, Airbags equivalent to masks and droplets, and Crumplezones equivalent to masks and aerosols.  All help in their own way but they work best when all the system is in place.</p>

        <p>I get that too.  Any analogy tends to break at some point.  I think of this whole thing as a "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country" type of thing.  Had it been presented that way from the start, the mandates probably wouldn't have even been necessary.  Masks and COVID will end.  The lessons learned will be forgotten, again.</p>

        <p>I think you think I meant lock down.  Lock down fits in differently b/c it's more like just not driving your car which is 100% effective.  Social distancing = ~6ft rule it's the most important part in the system followed closely by the mask.</p>

        <p>I don't know... from my perspective, it's not that much further than I'm used to anyway.  Not getting crowded up on while waiting in a line, more room between people in gatherings isn't so bad.  Like the masks, it's a temporary thing.  The better disciplined we are about it for a short time, the faster our case numbers can come down and get everything back to regular/normal.  If we'd have done the shutdowns well and not started up so soon plus taken care of the people who got screwed in the shutdowns we'd be pretty normal at this point, like most of the world.</p>

        <p>Depends on how you live life, I suppose. I have a ton of friends, enjoy meeting people whenever and wherever, and travel for work about 15-20 times per year (until his year, of course). While I don’t slobber over people I view physical contact as a vital part of the human experience. For people like me, this social distancing BS is a soulless nightmare.</p>

        <p>I tend to agree with that sentiment. As a caveat, I do believe that seatbelts should at least be required for children under the age of 18, or maybe 16, and that parents/guardians/the driver should be legally responsible for that. But other than that, adults should do what they want.</p>

        <p>As a libertarianish person, I respect your point.  However I think I'd still say it's fine for children since they are too young to make good decisions on their own and it's a good habit.  Plus seat belts do not cause harm in regular use, unlike masks.  But yeah, there's got to be some limit on this nanny state push.</p>

        <p>Ultimately the government owns the roads and I agree to follow their rules.  I think seatbelt and drunk driving laws on private property are bullshit.</p>
<p>Likewise if the government wants to mandate masks on government properties, whatever.  If the government wants to force businesses to mandate masks, that's where I draw the line.</p>

        <p>This is my opinion on the mask argument, helpfully it's also my opinion on the shirt-wearing policy:</p>
<p>If a company insists I wear roman battle armour if I want to enter their store, all power to them. If, without government pressure they decide that that is what they want to see, I will either wear roman battle armour to their store or not shop there. The same obviously goes for masks, and (although I never go shirtless) shirts.</p>
<p>The problem is when we have government agencies totally disregarding private property rights by mandating that businesses enforce a mask policy. If you wish to not wear a mask/shirt/battle armour, and the company in question is perfectly happy to serve you without any one of those things, then that is absolutely their call. I find this a really easy to apply argument: it works for smoking bans, wedding cakes, offensive slogans, pretty much anything really.</p>

<p>No, I absolutely do not agree that there is a time and place for masks, outside of a dentist wearing one while working on your teeth or an operating room. You think it's okay to enable and cater to this mass psychosis? You think this stupid medieval quackery and dystopian nightmare should in any way be given an excuse? Absolutely not. A virus so dangerous and deadly that the vast majority of people clear it within a few days without ever knowing they even had it? A virus with a 0.2% IFR, but we're not allowed to state that simple fact because in this insanely idiotic and dystopian society it is considered blasphemy, and simply stating any truth at all gets the equivalent response of "Burn the heretic!"? So there is that number one truth...that this virus doesn't warrant any of the ridiculous measures that have been imposed. </p>
<p>And then there is the second truth...this whole moronic fallacy of why everyone needs to muzzled at all times in public. It's never talked about...and if it's mentioned then you get the usual whole "muh Asians where masks" bullshit, which is both xenophobic and ignorant, as well as a complete misunderstanding of why during flu season in Asia you might see one out of a hundred people wearing a mask. It is because that person actually has symptoms...like uncontrollable coughing, and so they wear a mask for a few days until they no longer have symptoms. But here we are in bizarro clownworld Idiocracy land, where they believe everyone must wear a mask because everyone perpetually has covid, (and doesn't even know it because they have no symptoms), and at the same time there will be mass asymptomatic spreading events..of a 0.2% IFR virus that kills those already at death's door...and it makes you the equivalent of a murderer if you unknowingly spread a mild respiratory virus to someone who then spreads it to someone, who spreads it to someone else, who then might spread it to someone who is immunocompromised...what in the depth of Hades is this absurd shit that masquerades as logic these days? Six months ago these morons would have called this preposterous. Now it is their gospel and they act like they've always believed it.</p>

        <p>I've had this conversation IRL. The point I tried to make is that realistically, not everyone is wearing a seatbelt every time they get behind the wheel. There are people who don't wear shoes or shirts when entering businesses. Likewise, there's no way to ensure that 300 million Americans (or eight billion people worldwide) are going to consistently wear masks. Similarly, when I hear that the pandemic will be over once everyone wears masks, all I hear is "when pigs fly". Policy that ignores human nature is doomed to fail.</p>

        <p>The no shoes and shirt policy is frankly dumb as well and lots of stores ignore it, especially by the beach.  Most germs on bottom of feet are also on bottom of shoes, and any toe fungus could be blocked by me choosing to wear shoes myself so as long as I follow the policy, what you do will not affect me.  As for shirts, other than occasional retina damage from having to see flesh I may not want to see, there is no health risk.   That policy is in place to keep up appearances, not for health reasons.  Also stores to my knowledge (with some likely exceptions) are not forced to enforce those laws, it's their choice. </p>
<p>Seatbelts have a long track record of proven health benefits so there is some argument there but masks do not have that.  Also seat belts do not cause harm when used in normal situations, they do not cause blocking of oxygen, people to feel faint, if you are old or asthmatic you can still easily wear a seat belt, etc so there is not much downside other than very minor hassle.  This is not about speed of implementing bs laws, it's about bs laws being bs that should not be implemented.</p>

        <p>That's not your actual argument.   </p>
<p>Here's your *actual* argument: </p>
<p>WAAHHHHH I don't wanna! WAAAAAHHHHH!!!"   </p>
<p>You just don't want to admit it; you want to falsely frame yourself as a victim because you're not allowed to be a bioterrorist, recklessly endangering lives wherever you go just so that you can do whatever you want whenever you want and not have to think of anyone or anything apart from yourself.   </p>
<p>What's hilarious to me is that it's always people like you who dearly love to lie to yourselves and others that you're family men..that you legitimately care about the health and well being of your family, and that you own guns to protect them, but this pandemic has exposed that to be a lie. You can't even be bothered to do something as basic as put on a mask without being forced to.   </p>
<p>You choose not to, and when we all eventually end up in a police state out of necessity because of people like you who stubbornly refuse to stop spreading COVID wherever you go, the entire country will suffer, but you are the ones who will suffer the most for it, because you refuse to deflate your ego and discipline yourselves enough to put other people's health above your own convenience. And again, that's not something you *can't* do; it's something you *refuse* to do; don't confuse the two.   </p>
<p>You could easily start wearing a mask tomorrow if you actually wanted and cared enough to do so; all it would take is for you to stand up and decide that you're going to be a decent human being and refuse to continue to put other people's lives at risk in the name of your own personal freedom.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you are saying about statewide mandates, but the thing about “no shoes, no shirt, no service” is that in that example is you’re talking about a private company taking you to wear pants. Private companies could only let people in red hats enter their store if they wanted. If the owner of a store wants you to wear a mask and you don’t want to then they have no obligation to let you conduct business their establishment, and that’s a universal reality of living in a free country.</p>

        <p>What about the "it's their constitutional right to deny you service" argument?  You seem good with saying it's some sort of constitutional right taken away from you but you don't respect theirs.  A business owner is not entitled to open their doors or do business with you for any reason they see fit (with few exceptions).  Covid was a sudden and abrupt change, masks are temporary.  It's possible that masks wouldn't even be necessary at this point if we'd have had good compliance with it.  Instead we're dragging it out.</p>

<p>People touch their faces more.  Masks can lead to a false sense of security.  And if one <em>does</em> manage to obtain the virus between their nose/mouth and a mask, the viral <strong>load</strong> can increase, making it more dangerous.  I could go on but you get the idea.</p>

        <p>Not saying that it's necessarily the truth, but it does seem possible.  Fauci (not that we should necessarily believe him, because he has been all over the place, but people do) himself said as much (so did the WHO) about the efficacy of mask wearing.  And a lot of us consider the ramifications of covering our faces; we don't interact the same way, we don't smile at each other. We look at each other with suspicion, and as possible threats.  Other things, but worst of all to me is that we are teaching our children to be afraid of other people, masked or not, because there is no "end game" to these 'precautions'.  They <em>might</em> go away next month, perhaps next year, perhaps 4 or 5 years down the road.</p>
