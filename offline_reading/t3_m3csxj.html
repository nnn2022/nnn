    <strong>After detailing how containment/vaccination will backfire and make things worse, Geert Vanden Bossche goes on in his open letter dooming and saying the only thing that can save us is a *different &amp; better vaccine*! Science-heads are all psychos!</strong>
    <p><p>I found this guy by following some comments in this sub pointing also to r/LockdownCriticalLeft</p>
<p>I think he is probably right in his theory that containment and current vaccines will just make the problem worse, because the virus will adapt-- upwards modulate its infectivity characteristics to overcome containment strategies such as lockdowns and masks, as well as relatively quickly adapting its spike protein to reinfect all the dumbasses who get the vaccine. It was a poor strategy; it could only work in a cartoon reality where we could basically "pause time" and vaccinate everyone at the same time. Instead it has just entered us into a race with a virus which will obviously win.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/shg0VWkz0VM</p>
<p>One key takeaway is: don't get the fucking vaccine, because once the virus (probably) adapts its spike protein to subvert the vaccine, the vaccine-driven antibodies will still weakly and ineffectually bind to it, blocking or crowding out any response your innate immune system could mount based on this same antigen. Innate immune system is more important for healthy and young, and the vaccine can easily dampen it, even when the vaccine is itself no longer effective, leaving you less protected than you ever naturally would have been.</p>
<p>He details a very interesting theory about how coronaviruses utilize younger healthier people as a reservoir in order to become a persistent seasonal illness, basically infecting them asymptomatically and being mildly infectious during a short window as the innate immune system is momentarly dampened upon the initial handoff to a first adaptive immune system response. Basically coronaviruses and humans have coexisted a long time and they have herd-based strategies for surviving long-term.</p>
<p>My strategy is to just be healthy and try to go out and be exposed to people as much as possible and not get the fucking vaccine if course, not use sanitizer, avoid the face-diaper, etc. Just keep my innate immune system stimulated and in contact with whatever challenges may currently exist in my locale. Not override my immune system with a hard-coded all-in tunnel-vision approach focused on one genetic domain of a virus which we know mutates super fast.</p>
<p>Anyway he's mostly good on the technical aspects of this I think but at the end he's shilling another theoretical vaccine and dooming about how bad the virus is. I mean, as long as he's not in favor of any lockdowns or measurements (that you can't opt out of) then fine, go ahead and try to make a better vaccine. And that also must be opt-in. Here's the open letter and excerpt:</p>
<p>https://dryburgh.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geert_Vanden_Bossche_Open_Letter_WHO_March_6_2021.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;Paradoxically, the only interventon that could ofer a perspectve to end this pandemic (other than to let
it run its disastrous course) is …VACCINATION. Of course, the type of vaccines to be used would be
completely diferent of conventonal vaccines in that they’re not inducing the usual suspects, i.e., B and T
cells, but NK cells. There is, indeed, compelling scientfc evidence that these cells play a key role in
facilitatng complete eliminaton of Covid-19 at an early stage of infecton in asymptomatcally infected
subjects. NK cells are part of the cellular arm of our innate immune system and, alike natural Abs, they
are capable of recognizing and atacking a broad and diversifed spectrum of pathogenic agents. There is
a sound scientfc ratonale to assume that it is possible to ‘prime’ NK cells in ways for them to recognize
and kill Coronaviruses at large (include all their variants) at an early stage of infecton. NK cells have
increasingly been described to be endowed with the capacity to acquire immunological memory. By
educatng these cells in ways that enable them to durably recognize and target Coronavirus-infected
cells, our immune system could be perfectly armed for a targeted atack to the universe of Coronaviruses
prior to exposure. As NK cell-based immune defense provides sterilizing immunity and allows for broad-
spectrum and fast protecton, it is reasonable to assume that harnessing our innate immune cells is going
to be the only type of human interventon lef to halt the dangerous spread of highly infectous Covid-19
variants.</p>
<p>My vote is to let it run its DisAStrOus coUrSe (!!!). The title of his letter is "Halt All Covid-19 Mass Vaccination Immediately" which is a good start but I think we need to just admit that the damage is done, we never had a chance to "beat it", coronaviruses know how to manipulate human host populations and there will be casualties. Maybe in the future one could indeed "beat" them through technological means, but not on an emergency schedule, no way. Why did we think vaccine developers could win against a new coronavirus when they can barely combat influenza and every year are "on the back foot" / "one step behind"? We have to accept the consequences and that we will not have a scientific panacea we can count on.</p>
<p>Anecdotally I notice that those who get the flu vaccine are the ones always getting the flu. Vaccines can work in certain situations (prophylactic) but obviously for circulating seasonal coronaviruses they are perpetually several steps behind the virus' evolution or wrongly predicting it, and therefore the recipients often end up worse off because it crowds out the innate immune system. It also forms a feedback loop for funding and research, because the virus adapts to their strategies and then researchers can just say oMg it'S muTAtINg sO FasT wE nEed tO TRy eVeN HArDeR whAT We aRE alReAdY doiNg!!! It's whack-a-mole / medical theatrics.</p>
<p>I am looking forward a bit for the guilty pleasure of seeing the vaccine cucks potentially get more ill once/if the virus escapes the RBD antigen mediated immunity confered by all the major vaccines. I do fear though that we will enter into a permanent loop, basically the authoritarian version of the perpetual losing battle that is the influenza vaccination program. That is, perpetually re-inflaming the lockdown and vaccination hysteria, and the mainstream narrative will be "supervirus continues its path of destruction as heroic scientists valiantly fight to defend against each new devious variant".</p>
<p>The reality is, there is no supervirus potential. Humans and coronaviruses have been together for a long time, and there is basically an equilibrium point or a stale-mate, which we have been in and will always be in, wherein the viruses can continue to exist but gain no more than a foothold in being able to wipe out the elderly and weak during the cold season (usually), and to jump around asymptomatically in healthier people or during the warm season in order to perpetuate itself year-to-year. Acknowledging this state of affairs almost makes one look at coronaviruses as not a scourge but simply one of the necessary "grim reapers". It's part of life that the weak and elderly basically become an opportunistic playground for all forms of life which favor that niche. It's an unavoidable fact of life that some species will occupy that role, and trying to fight them will just open up other opportunities. You simply cannot keep a dying or weak person disease-free. This is why natural death is often like a constellation of causes; many of these grim reapers simultaneously race to occupy the spaces opened up by the cascading weaknesses of the body.</p>
<p>Don't get vaccinated and continue exposing your body to coronaviruses of all kinds. If you try to hide you will end up with an untrained immune system like the Native Americans and smallpox. Unfortunately the border closures are going to exacerbate these types of effects. I would rather be able to travel myself or be exposed to cross border travellers. But border closures create all these potential adverse rapid exposure events, rather than the more natural ongoing/gradual/constant exposure scenario, where one's immune system is always gently aware of the coronavirus gene pool.</p>
<p>But still don't worry. Believing in superviruses will make you go insane, like all these science-heads. If only they understood what life and death were, we could go back to living (and dying), instead of what they are imposing on us now which is: dying (and dying).</p></p>

        <p>This guy had various roles at some big Pharma companies in vaccine development (GSK, Novartis, Solvay). </p>
<p>He joined the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation as Senior Program Officer in Vaccine Discovery for Global Health. </p>

        <p>I think he is right about the mainstream strategy not working but I guess it's honestly immaterial. All human intervention with the virus which is not individual free choice is kind of a fool's errand and kind of playing God. For this guy to be so sure of his productions and all, it's yeah.. ego, money, greed. I still do hope for a backfire of the mainstream strategy though, as one possible path out of this.</p>

        <p>You're making the classic doomer mistake of believing the virus is an antagonist like in Plague Inc. The idea that viruses modulate infectivity up and change their structure to get past vaccines is bizarre and seems to attribute agency to the virus.</p>

        <p>It's just lazy language, I don't actually mean it that way; It's just application of selective pressure. Basically the containment measures and vaccine-conveyed antibody profile select for various traits, which I think are further outside of the normal envelope or equillibrium between humans and coronavurises, and therefore likely to make the situation more volatile. I don't attribute agency, we know that these viruses mutate quickly to selective pressure and we are applying very strong and artificial and heterogeneous selective pressure which already has and will continue to shape the virus population, including how infectious it is and also how it's spike protein is coded for.</p>
