        <p>Maybe it's just me, but I am noticing a lot of articles lately, questioning the masks, and stating they do not help in this pandemic. While that may seem like great news to many here, I am afraid they may use this as a justification for a potential future lockdown. "Seems masks may not work like we thought, the real solution is to do a longer, stricter lockdown, guys."</p>
<p>And you know what the kicker is? I'm willing to bet, they will still keep masks, even if what I described happens. They will later on launch another media campaign about the benefits of masks, and "new studies show they do/did work!".</p>

        <p>I have also seen a few articles about people who were "wearing masks and doing everything right" and still getting the virus. Like one story about someone who traveled on a plane to a family gathering that was mostly outside, but he and several others ended up with Covid. He was quoted as saying "I don't think I could have gotten it on the plane because everyone was wearing masks." </p>
<p>It seems like the mask maniacs don't even understand how masks might work, if they do, by stopping larger droplets. They don't stop exhalation of air and they can't block virus particles. But these people act like masks are magic virus stoppers... "The BLM protests couldn't have spread the virus because everyone wore masks!" Honestly they are probably taking more risks, like getting closer to others in enclosed environments, because of their over-reliance on the magic masks.</p>

<p>I would actually laugh because this is such bullshit. I was there when the 3rd Precinct burned down. Only about 1 in 3 people were wearing a mask of any sort.</p>

        <p>Well, they do help extending the pandemic.. creating social bias, lowering physical performance, contamination from pathogens accumulated on masks from use and breathing in air from synthetic materials these masks are made from, like polypropylene   polyester,  etc, It's nothing new</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40521-019-0197-5">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40521-019-0197-5</a></p>
<p>I mean many people complain about peanut allergy or dairy allergies, they follow special diets because of reactions to such substances. In some air-flights you were asked "not to eat nuts" because of "allergy" concerns. So how comes they haven't literally revolted against the use of these fabrics, which touch the entire face for hours and hours?</p>
<p>Then for mouth-breathers it's even worse as this type uses the upper lungs which tend to hyperventilation and induce extra stress and with whatever dirt/pathogen accumulate on the mask surface it is taken-in. And part of the mask is practically inside the mouth. Imagine a mouth breather in a long trip sleeping with a mask on.</p>
<p>And at the top, the government asks the public not to use respirators because they don't protect others?</p>

        <p>Right... I also have concerns about the material masks are made from. The disposables are all made in China and we know how their manufacturing practices can be. What about inhalation of micro plastics or other particles? What the masks say they’re made of and what they actually contain may not be the same thing. Are we inhaling fibers when we wear these things?</p>

        <p>&rt;  Are we inhaling fibers when we wear these things? </p>
<p>I believe we do. If I find a direct test study I will post it but if you see here</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/microplastic-pollution-in-air-pollutes-our-lungs/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/microplastic-pollution-in-air-pollutes-our-lungs/</a></p>
<p><em>Microplastics in the indoor air result from the fragmentation through  friction, heat or light of plastic objects found in our homes.</em>  </p>
<p>And here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/2018/03/how-damaging-is-breathing-in-microplastics/">https://www.plasticsoupfoundation.org/en/2018/03/how-damaging-is-breathing-in-microplastics/</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Also, just by wearing synthetic clothes, plastic fibers are constantly being released in the air</em></strong>. </p>
<p>So friction and use obviously generates these particles.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I have been trying to search and am shocked by the lack of data about what we are discussing. I don’t think for a moment that the “surgical” masks we are buying at the drugstore are comparable to the real surgical masks healthcare workers wear. Would be super curious to see some kind of experiment showing what people inhale when they wear those cheap disposables. Kind of have a hunch we will find out there are bad long term effects from what they contain, though I hope I am wrong.</p>

        <p>I live in Illinois. </p>
<p>At first the stares made me feel uncomfortable. But now, well, they still make me feel uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Also, I find myself getting into long conversations with random masked people. Just light convo about the weather and such. I think they just really want to talk to a maskless person. </p>
<p>I've seen a masked person look at a maskless person then pull off his own mask.</p>
<p>I sound like some kind of 70s dystopian scifi character out of a John Brunner novel.</p>

        <p>This is priceless. I sent this article to a friend with whom I have has discussions with in the past about the pandemic, lockdowns, etc. He is a doomer really. Anyway. He said this, after receiving this article via messenger. ‘Why are you sending me right wing propaganda ‘... I kid you not!! The Danes?  Right wing?!! So just because I send him a well researched article about masks that doesn’t support the mainstream narrative he calls  it right wing propaganda.  This terrifies me actually. It really does.</p>
