    <strong>Are the reported excess deaths numbers and funeral home capacity accurate?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m against all of the COVID measures. I support handshakes, hugs, and smiles. But there are a couple of numbers that I believe could reliably indicate the severity of the pandemic. These are “excess deaths” and “funeral home capacity”. According to the mainstream media, we have 25% more deaths this year than previous year due to the pandemic. And that funeral homes are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>These are hard facts to fabricate, manipulate, and misrepresent.</p>
<p>I’d like to know what you all think about them. Do you think these numbers are accurate?</p>
<p>My sources: googling “COVID excess deaths” and “funeral homes COVID”</p></p>

        <p>I’m with you brother, but if the excess deaths number is fabricated don’t you think it would be way too easy of a lie to detect?</p>

        <p>Excess deaths is an interesting number.  Think about it.</p>
<p>Let's say you have 10 deaths.  How many excess is that?</p>
<p>Well you need to know what you <em>expect</em> to have, right?</p>
<p>So how would you calculate that?  Just look at last year?</p>
<p>Ok ... you had 9 deaths last year.</p>
<p>So how many excess did you have this year?  Well .. "1", right?</p>
<p>But wait!  What if "9" isnt a usual year? What if the year before it was "5"?</p>
<p>So now you have 5, 9, and how much excess is "10"?  Well lets say you average 5 and 9 and get "7".  So you have "3" excess!</p>
<p>But wait?  Do you have "1" excess or do you have "3" excess?</p>
<p>Because you had a constant "10" deaths all along .. but first you had "1 excess" and then you had "3 excess".  How was the excess changing if your death number was always the same?</p>
<p>Well ... it all depends on how you calculate your <em>expected</em> deaths, doesn't it?  If you say you expected a low number you get high excess deaths, and vice versa.  If I say we expect 1 death, we had 9 excess deaths.</p>
<p>So the only trick is, how do you magic up a lower expected death number?</p>

        <p>They usually do it based on the average of the 10 years before.</p>
<p>If there is no excess over that average number, they say "We had no excess death!"</p>
<p>Which is what we are on target for right now: No excess deaths compared to the 10 years before 2020.</p>

        <p>Pretty low-effort post on your part. If you want to have peers review your sources, link the actual sources. If you constantly feed into narrative themes with your searches, guess what Google’s algorithm does? Yes, it feeds you more of the same, thus leading to confirmation bias. And overall, the quality of your information deteriorates as you continue feeding, while the number of people who will take advantage of you increases.</p>
