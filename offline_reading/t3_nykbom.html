        <p>100% correct, we should all do what big business says because they have our best interests in mind at all times. If you're not following the examples of our courageous businesses you just don't understand science.</p>
<p>You know who else always has our best interests in mind? The government. Let's all agree that big business and the government have only one goal in mind, improving OUR lives.</p>
<p>I'm so glad we all decided that government and big business is on our side again. Lol remember how stupid we were a few years ago when we had our own opinions and didn't blindly follow? What a bunch of idiots we were.</p>

        <p>Covid vaccines don't work and masks don't work</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history">You trust companies like this</a></p>
<p>But also:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html">Vaccine breakthrough cases are expected.</a></p>
<p>A vaccine breakthrough is when someone gets infected after having been fully vaccinated for more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>This is from the CDC...</p>
<p>And also, <a href="https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/vQJdMJejmijx">the CDC announced a month ago: </a></p>
<p>"As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause."</p>
<p>The CDC will not be counting any covid-19 cases in vaccinated people. This would cause a tremendous decline in cases. The only cases that they are recording now are cases that result in hospitalizations or death due to Covid.</p>
<p>That is why the numbers are low, lots of people vaccinated so lots of people don't get counted... not to mention other covid variations get around your vaccine. And those cases are never reported, just as the CDC instructs the US medical system to do.</p>
<p>We the people are not your enemy.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on how masks don't work. Do you realize how large water vapor is when it travels through the air? Way larger than virus particles. And water vapor gets through your mask and foggs up your glasses. Guess what other, much smaller virus particles do; they go through the mask! And if you don't believe me, then you can look it up yourself that water vapor and air is usually around 15,000 - 50,000 nanometers in size. The largest virus particle ever recorded was 500 nanometers in size. So if you think about it, it's pretty clear that this is all a sham. </p>

        <p>i said there’s no need to get so irrationally upset that a business asks you to wear something before they serve you or let you in. that is their right as stated by the government. also you are giving examples from 2009 to show that Pfizer isn’t trustworthy or something, when that link doesn’t say anything about antivirals or vaccines. it talks about one specific anti epileptic drug and a specific antibiotic drug, both of which had been pulled from shelves already. maybe for the idiots on this sub who don’t read for jack shit, your arguments would make sense. but you’re just babbling nonsense to try and prove your point. hyperlinks don’t make you smart or reputable when they have little to no relevancy to the argument at hand.</p>

        <p>Bars serve alcohol. Alcohol is poison. That’s why it’s called ‘intoxication’. It’s literally toxic to put inside your body. People who own bars can’t be terribly into healthy lifestyles.</p>

I’m anti injecting my body with a foreign substance to protect against a virus that is very unlikely to harm me much beyond the common flu.

<p>It's like how the placebo effect works, even if you know it's placebo. </p>
<p>They know the history of blaming problems on a subsection of people and using those people as the scapegoats for all their problems. They know that, yet they still participate in it.
I have had many vaxxed tell me that they hope I die, hope I get sent to prison, etc.</p>

        <p>Tetanus vaccine does not confer lifetime immunity. It's currently recommended that you get a booster shot every 10 years. Unless you get a deep or puncture type wound. Then I would get the booster.</p>

        <p>then why is it nearly all of the people ending up with covid at the hospital are unvaccinated? I have no idea what you're trying to say when you say it's not a vaccine. It does the same thing every other vaccine does - triggers an immune response to train your immune system against something.</p>

        <p>Right, and especially when it isn't even really a vaccine in the traditional sense, it's not weakened viruses, it's gene modification. Why are many people against genetically modified food but don't understand why people might be against modifying their own genes with an experimental, rushed injection by companies with a very shady and criminal history?</p>

        <p>When the general public look at antivaxx, they have every reason to imagine the bill gates microchip radiation spike transmission lot. Because the amount of people who follow these pages on Facebook and Instagram far far outweigh the number of people in this Reddit. Just for fun you can easily find and follow these pages on Instagram and many of them have well over 100-250k followers</p>
<p>It's good if you yourself have opinions reasonable enough to not feel like you want to be labeled 'crazy' or a theoriest</p>
<p>But until people like you with reasonable doubt dispell the myths and lies from other antivaxxers, how can one look at this group of people at a whole and only consider the normal ones? Because 'we're' how you put it includes people from this page who very very very much are antivaxx. If you don't want to look like that, then don't associate with the people who rightfully so make you look like that</p>

        <p>Yes, that article points out that it's less than 300 people affected, out of over 130 million. Non-covid vaccines often have similar ratios of severe reactions. The government doesn't yet have all-powerful control over everything on the internet. If there were something glaringly wrong with the vaccines, aspiring scientists would undoubtedly blow the whistle for a chance of fame and heroism. The rumors being passed around are nothing but ramblings of uneducated folk explaining to other uneducated folk their views on it. It's stupid to take them at face value.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of vaccine requirements before entering places either. But you're not helping that side of the argument.</p>

        <p>a gene therapy can be a vaccine, they aren’t mutually exclusive lol</p>
<p>A vaccine innoculates against a pathogen while a gene therapy is a medical intervention using nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). These mRNA vaccines prove they can be combined as they confer a high degree of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are mutually exclusive in the real world. If something does not stop INFECTION and TRANSMISSION, which these mRNA gene therapies do NOT do.... they should NOT according to my doctor with 40 years of experience in the medical profession at JHH in Baltimore be called a vaccine.</p>

        <p>From the clinical trials and studies on real workd data from the global vaccine rollout the mRNA vaccines absolutely do significantly reduce infection by and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Care to provide actual data for your claims that they don’t do these things?</p>
<p>Also if that’s what your doctor is saying clearly they aren’t a very good or smart doctor - I also doubt they’re an immunologist.</p>

        <p>I think the vaccines likely do stop transmission, but the report that Pfizer submitted to the FDA (the pdf is downloadable from the FDA website), which I read through last night, does explicitly say they have no data on whether the vaccine prevents transmission; only that it reduces symptoms.</p>
<p>That being said, I have no idea what other studies have been done about preventing transmission since then, but I think this is what people are referring to when they say it doesn’t prevent transmission.</p>

        <p>so yes the clinical trials only cared about infection, hospitalizations and deaths - they weren’t designed to assess transmission since the most important part of the vaccines was saving lives. But studies after the global vaccine rollout was initiated have provided strong evidence that the vaccines also significantly reduce covid-19 transmission: </p>

        <p>They are interested in making a product that works so that they can sell it so while their first thought is profit (they are a company afterall) that doesn’t mean their best interests automatically conflict with that of the people seeking vaccination. An effective product will profit so yes they are strongly incentivized to make a vaccine that is safe and effective.</p>

        <p>Covid vaccines don't work and masks don't work</p>
<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history">You trust companies like this</a></p>
<p>But also:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html">Vaccine breakthrough cases are expected.</a></p>
<p>A vaccine breakthrough is when someone gets infected after having been fully vaccinated for more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>This is from the CDC...</p>
<p>And also, <a href="https://linksharing.samsungcloud.com/vQJdMJejmijx">the CDC announced a month ago: </a></p>
<p>"As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause."</p>
<p>The CDC will not be counting any covid-19 cases in vaccinated people. This would cause a tremendous decline in cases. The only cases that they are recording now are cases that result in hospitalizations or death due to Covid.</p>
<p>That is why the numbers are low, lots of people vaccinated so lots of people don't get counted... not to mention other covid variations get around your vaccine. And those cases are never reported, just as the CDC instructs the US medical system to do.</p>
<p>We the people are not your enemy.</p>
<p>Don't even get me started on how masks don't work. Do you realize how large water vapor is when it travels through the air? Way larger than virus particles. And water vapor gets through your mask and foggs up your glasses. Guess what other, much smaller virus particles do; they go through the mask! And if you don't believe me, then you can look it up yourself that water vapor and air is usually around 15,000 nanometers in size. The largest virus particle ever recorded was five hundred nanometers in size. So if you think about it, it's pretty clear that this is all a sham. </p>

<p>Honestly yeah with the US’ healthcare environment scummy people do shit and I’m glad the regulations were able to doll out such a massive fine. But you see, we have FDA review of the clinical trial data and now real world data to prove the effectiveness and safety of these vaccines. </p>
<p>Yeah, breakthrough infections because of variants since this pandemic has gone on for so long and there are so many people flaunting and ignoring public health measures which increase the spread/prevelance of variants.</p>
<p>LOL water vapour and respiratory droplets and fundamentally physically VERY different things. Covid19 spreads by being encased in respiratory droplets as the naked virus is destroyed extremely quickly.</p>

<p>I'm providing facts, yes water vapor passes through a mask very easily, which is why your glasses can fog up so easily. And the virus in the water vapor will go through the mask with it. If you looked at the data I linked it clearly describes the scientific sizes of water vapor specifically, and how it's much larger than virus particles. So if a virus particle is in the water vapor, and the water vapor can get through the mask easily, then the virus and the water vapor both are getting through!</p>
<p>&rt;Yeah, breakthrough infections because of variants since this pandemic has gone on for so long and there are so many people flaunting and ignoring public health measures which increase the spread/prevelance of variants.</p>
<p>And where's your proof? You really need me to have proof of stuff and I'm providing facts. </p>
<p>&rt;And you have data/studies tha5 the covid19 vaccines and masks don’t help at all?</p>
<p>Did you look at the scientific measurements of the objects I listed? And by the way, those scientific measurements don't care if you disagree with them. I have linked everything. </p>
<p>Also, water vapor is tiny droplets of water in the air. And yes viruses can travel through those tiny droplets of water called water vapor.</p>

        <p>the virus is not in water vapour you dingus, water vapour is not a medium for viral transmission - respiratory droplets are. Water vapour is LITERALLY A GAS LOL.</p>
<p>Source? Just look on Google when variants started cropping up. They took awhile to become predominant in our populations. Variants need time to evolve, their very existence is evidence that this pandemic has been dragged out long enough to cause them to mutate and be selected for. You meanwhile don’t have proof for your facts, care to prove the virus spreads primarily in water vapour? 
Cause your measurements of size mean jack shit if the virus isn’t in the water vapour and instead respiratory droplets. There are no tiny water droplets in water vapour because water vapour is a gas not a liquid</p>

        <p>The trials were not designed to mesure the impact of vaccination on the rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Although to be fair, the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths compared to population size are so low that it would have taken a long time and lots of participants to collect any sort of meaningful data on this.</p>
<p>Pfizer's data is based on 170 Covid cases, 162 who were in the placebo group and 8 who were in the vaccine group. This is how they came up with their 95% efficacy figure. It's also important to point out that they excluded a lot of vaccinated participants from their data for serious breach of protocol. I'd be quite interested in knowing what that breach was, because excluding so many data points can really skew the data.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that we are discussing relative risk reduction, not the absolute risk reduction.</p>
<p>Real-world data suggests a lower effectiveness. It is expected that effectiveness in real world data would be lower than efficacy from trial data. However, the figures are very different. I looked at a BMJ study suggesting 44% lower risk of being admitted to hospital and 51% lower risk of death.</p>
<p>The vaccines aren't as safe as is claimed. They have been linked to blood clots, myocarditis, and deaths. As more data comes in, we may establish links to other side effects that are currently dismissed.</p>
<p>I'm not ignoring clinical trial data and real world data. I think it is genuinely worth calculating one's personal risk of catching Covid, of having long haul Covid, of being hospitalized due to Covid, of dying from Covid. And also to calculate one's own risk of developing blood clots or myocarditis from the vaccine. There are demographics where the vaccine may in fact not be worth the risks.</p>
<p>And there is nothing wrong with being cautious with regards to mRNA vaccines and viral vectors vaccines, which are still relatively new compared to inactived ones like the ones developed by Sinovac/Sinopharm.</p>

        <p>Yes I was wrong with the clinical trials assessing hospitalizations, I was thinking of studies analyzing real world data following vaccination - although by preventing serious covid-19 cases that is in effect preventing hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Well these trials cannot deliberately infect people with the virus to test it so yes that’s how they got their numbers and they are pretty strong. As for exclusions it’s noted that 352 people out of the initial 18,860 participants in the vaccine arm were excluded for a variety of reason as seen in figure 1: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577</p>
<p>Now if you have a different source to suggest some far bigger number I’d love to see it but I don’t think there’s anything fishy about these 352 exclusions.</p>
<p>Absolute risk reduction isn’t that relevant of a number to be honest because even in the scope of something like the Spanish Flu if there was a vaccine against it it would seem like a small, irrelevant number. That’s the whole point of relative risk reduction because it puts into context those exposed to the disease and assessed how useful the intervention is. The goal of a vaccine is to prevent disease so of course you’re going to see far less cases overall. And the exposure of the groupd to covid19 was hampered by the nature of the world with all the pandemic measures. </p>
<p>Care to share this BMJ study? Because the steep dropping of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is pretty on par with the clinical trial data.</p>
<p>Umm no there has been no causal link of myocarditis to the vaccines and no blood clot links to the mRNA vaccines. AstraZeneca supposedly has some link to an extremely rare blood clotting event, but female birth control pills are more likely to cause a clot than AstraZeneca yet I don’t see this sub in arms looking to ban female birth control pills.</p>
<p>No demographic has been shown to be at greater risk of vaccine adverse events than covid19, none.</p>
<p>Actually we’ve been using live attenuated viral vector vaccines forever with the MMR vaccine being the most common. And mRNA vaccines have been thoroughly tested in humans for awhile now, it’s just that none of the vaccines were commercially viable due to already existing vaccines or demand not being sufficient.</p>

        <p>Part 1:</p>
<p>I agree with you, of course the trials cannot deliberately infect people as that would be unethical. In practice, it means they cannot do anything except wait for people to contract Covid-19 and then compare the two groups. The shorter the time frame of the study, the less people are going to contract Covid, which means less data on which to calculate the efficacy. </p>
<p>The follow-up was for 2 months, so whatever conclusion we draw from the study is applicable to 2 months. For other conclusions, we would look at real world effectiveness data. </p>
<p>Placebo participants have been able to get vaccinated since, so the ones who choose to get vaccinated can no longer be used for any long-term comparison. It makes sense from an ethical standpoint to allow them to get vaccinated of course.</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing the link :)</p>
<p>So, 352 participants were excluded in the vaccine arm (48 of them after the second dose) and 411 were excluded in the placebo arm (95 of them after the second dose). I agree that it doesn't seem like much in comparison to the overall number of participants who received two doses of either the vaccine (18,556) or the placebo (18,530). However, it does seem like a lot when only 170 participants were relevant for the efficacy calculation. (Although like you mentioned, the trials couldn't deliberately infect people which is why there isn't a bigger data set for this).</p>
<p>This leads me to argue that absolute risk reduction can be important. I'm not guaranteed to catch Covid. Depending on my level of exposure, my odds of catching it may be fairly low. However, if I choose to get vaccinated and show up to the appointment, I am pretty much guaranteed that the vaccine will be administered to me. This is why I'm not totally swayed by arguments such as "if you were to get Covid, your chance of a blood clot would be higher with Covid than with the vaccine" (see marketwatch link below). Same goes for any number of negative side-effects, even the mild and temporary ones. I understand that they use RRR when measuring the efficacy of a vaccine. However, I'd want to use conditional probabilities when deciding whether or not to get the vaccine and I would take into account what my risk is to begin with.</p>
<p>Yes, it's true that the level of exposure may be impacted by restrictions. Although not all of the restrictions, that's another debate altogether (I don't think all of them were useful. The term "lockdown" also means very different things in different places. In fact, I didn't come across any study that has conclusively shown that lockdowns longer than 2 weeks had much of an effect). We have to assume that the participants had similar behaviors, similar levels of exposure, and were living under the same restrictions (that last one is very likely). Again, a bigger sample size would be even better in order to minimize the impact of such differences on the study outcome.</p>
<p>I think I read in some notes to the editor of the BMJ the suggestion that if people had adverse reactions following vaccination and stayed home for a few days, this would reduce their exposure and might be relevant in a 2-month time frame (but obviously the larger the time frame, the more negligible that would be). But I don't know how relevant this is considering that the placebo arm also had adverse reactions. Also, other vaccines, like the one developed by AstraZeneca, used the meningoccal conjugate vaccine for the placebo group. Which is better in the sense that participants may be less likely to guess which group they were assigned to, but could be problematic when comparing side-effects following vaccination. I'm getting off topic though haha.</p>

        <p>I want to preface this as I just want to discuss/debate the issue at hand. I don’t know you and I mean not to attack your character or anything in these comments - my apologies if I’ve come off that way at any point.</p>
<p>For sure they could’ve waited longer which would’ve been nice but they had to weigh the benefits of waiting longer for more cases to accumulate in trial and starting to vaccinate the populace now. At what point is your inaction causing more harm than good?</p>
<p>Hey cheers man, and thanks for the NPR link, it’s for an issue in terms of trial integrity long term since like you stated, it’s unethical to just deny the placebo group the vaccine for the sake of the study once it’s being distributed to the public.</p>
<p>Now I guess this part is a matter of “trust” because in the first figure of the link I included it actually breaks down the reasons for their exclusion. I have no reason to suspect they are lying so until proven otherwise I myself believe what that figure is telling me - which is that the exclusions were made for legit reasons that were not to skew the data. You could argue that for example what if even a third of those lost to followup/withdrew after the second dose caught covid19 and that would significantly affect the final efficacy numbere. But we don’t have thata so it’s just unproductive speculation.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to be concerned about your own risk of catching covid19 and its potential impacts on your health and weigh if getting a vaccine is worth it for you. But for me, and I think many others now it’s less just for you protecting yourself (if you’re not in the vulnerable population) but to in general prevent its spread. </p>
<p>Oh I’m all in agreement there’s a debate to be had about the lockdowns, especially because how inconsistent they way in terms of execution and governmental support for those impacted by them. A lot of the issues coming around with epidemiological data from the public health measures is that what’s needed is time for retrospective analyses to be done - it’s really hard to have definitive conclusions while things are still going on now. </p>
<p>Eh no worries about getting off topic, I appreciated reading your comments here on the BMJ stuff. I guess right now though since the rollout has been so massive it’s more reliable to work with the current clinical data from public health departments</p>

        <p>there is no surveillance system for vaccine adverse events that can be bother proving causation and widely accessible since you need to investigate and analyze the clinical data from every case to determine the validity of the reports. VAERS just can’t be used the way you want it to. The reports in VAERS are meant to be analyzed by software and researchers en masse to identify possible trends and if they reach a threshold, trigger an actual investigation into them to see if they’re a real trend or not.</p>

        <p>My local tire shop in Alaska has a sign 5% off your bill if you wear a mask in the lobby. I took a pic of the sign and uploaded it to their page on Google maps so everyone can see where they stand. The state has never required masks and no other store in town requires them.</p>

        <p>These annoying reddit-Karens always accuse the people they hate of doing things that they do themselves. I just went to Yelp to leave a 5-star review for my local Trader Joe's (they dropped their mask requirement) and there are dozens of 1-star reviews complaining about how they are not requiring masks anymore. One of the negative reviews even said they will kick you out if you ask another customer to put on a mask. Even better. I will do all of my grocery shopping there now.</p>

        <p>The one thing we should do, if we decide to do this, is to not randomly find bars in other states or not near us and just review-bomb based on policies. That's how the doomers went about against the bars that were open during lockdown and it did cause damage before people reported the erroneous reviews to Yelp.</p>
<p>So if you're gonna leave negative reviews on bars that demand vaccine proof, make sure it's bars near you so there's plausibility that you went there</p>

        <p>That’s how the free market works. If customers don’t want to wear masks and your establishment requires masks, they won’t buy your product and they’ll leave a negative review for the bad service, or lack thereof. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Yelp, and other sites like Glassdoor and RateMyProfessor, will remove reviews they don’t like.</p>

        <p>I just don't understand what gives people the audacity to pressure others to take an experimental EUA drug without any knowledge of future risks or danger. The humans injections is the experiment. YOU are the lab rat. This is unacceptable behavior that disregards any semblance of medical privacy or informed consent. Do any of these idiots realize how many people have been hurt or killed? Why is asking a question on safety taboo? This is just an extension of the bullshit of the culture war... There's nothing virtuous about being gene therapied. So please fuck off with your self-righteous narcissism. These momos don't care about other people or their safety... they just want to dunk on others because they are weak, pathetic, scared little cult members. They are scared of independent thought because it challenges their naivete and highlights their failure towards self-responsibility. I've done my own due diligence and research, I don't need to hear you chant groupthink slogans to show how you haven't done yours. Do everyone a favor and piss off.</p>

        <p>It is how it has worked I had to have a while list of vaccines to go to Public school. The military requires all kinds of vaccines in their line of work for the health of the individual and unit. And their are whole lists of laws restricting my right to do a myriad of activities because it is dangerous to others.

        <p>Both of my listed examples are examples of the government requiring vaccines  to argue that how it never worked opinion.  B vaccines don’t make you immune they lower the rock of catching it and people like you that aren’t taking steps to stop are going to allow it to spread mutate and make my decision work less and c why should my health my communities and everyone else’s hinge on the fact that you don’t believe the 100’a of hours and millions of dollars scientists and doctors put into this.</p>

        <p>How is that the question you we are taking about how long the vaccine took and why it’s safe me disproving your points doesn’t make me irrelevant.  Your last point was how testing and approval weren’t part of the design process and shouldn’t be considered so I linked you articles showing it is.

        <p>It’s not stupid for me to say you risking getting a contagious disease and spreading to people who did the right choice is irresponsible and shouldn’t be allowed.   People who get vaccinated are at a lower risk not no risk and some people just can’t get vaccines.    So yes you being dumb will burden us.
