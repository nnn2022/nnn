        <p>95% of all covid deaths are over the age of 50.</p>
<p>95% also have 1 or more (on average 4+) long term health issues that would have been listed as their cause of death in any other year.</p>
<p>Take a look at this article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/covid-19-takes-dramatic-toll-on-u-s-life-expectancy</p>
<p>Read past the scary headline and to the "Drivers of the Change in U.S. Life Expectancy, 2019-2020" graph and read the paragraph before it and look at the bar graph.</p>
<p>Of course they aren't reporting it like I am, but you can easily see where the "Fewer deaths from other factors" basically offsets the brand new never been seen before "Covid Death" metric.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7014e2.htm</p>
<p>&rt;Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1.</p>
<p>&rt;Only 5.5% of death certificates had COVID-19 without any other conditions listed.</p>
<p>Now, of course the CDC doesn't agree with me on how the majority of the 94.5% of "covid deaths" with multiple comorbidities would have been listed under those comorbidities before 2020... But it is at least honest enough to tell us that only 5.5% of their death toll figures are people who died from Covid and Covid only.</p>
<p>5.5% of 378,048 death certificates in 2020 is 20,792. A number that isn't so scary and more in line with the past history of people dying from the common cold each year.</p>
<p>At the outset we were told 20 million may die. We were told people were dying in the streets in China. Our "Media" and "Government" locked us in our homes and made us afraid to touch door knobs, and convinced us that anyone of any age might die from Covid. Even today they try to convince us that kids under 17 may die and need to be vaccinated - even though the science shows they have a 99.998% survival rate.</p>
<p>They needed to create the fear and "crisis" that would get everyone on board for testing to find the coronavirus - the virus that causes the common cold. And then - by blaming that common cold for "covid deaths" when in previous years they would have been listed under the 4+ other comorbidities that the patient suffered - they could create the "crisis" they needed to institute all kinds of political and societal changes. Changes that are mostly made by decree, not by any legislative or democratic process.</p>
<p>You could have created the same "Pandemic" in any other year if you tested everyone who went to a hospital or died for a coronavirus, and then attributed the cause of death to that coronavirus. All it took was the fear and panic to get that ball rolling - as well as an aging population that was going to increase yearly deaths due to their age.</p>
<p>We never tested everyone at a hospital for coronavirus before 2020 because it is a crazy idea and not scientific at all. Only panic and fear could convince doctors and hospitals and "health care professionals" and "scientists" to test everyone for the virus that causes the common cold, and then attribute "Deaths For Any Reason" to that cold, rather than the 4+ other more obvious reasons.</p>
<p>According to this link: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/</p>
<p>342,683 of the 601,124 deaths (They are counting all time, not year 2020 only like the numbers above.) More than 1/2 of the numbers they tracked are over 75 years old. 57.007040144795% of all covid deaths.</p>
<p>79.306099906176% of "covid deaths" are in the 65+ age range. 476,728.</p>
<p>If 80% of all covid deaths are baby boomer age. (At 65 today you were born in 1956.) and 80% of 378,048 covid deaths in 2020 is 302438... That is 0.4% of the 70 million baby boomers that make up our population.</p>
<p>Why would anyone be shocked that 0.4% of baby boomers died?</p>
<p>95.227107884563% of "covid deaths" are in the 50+ age range. 572,433. I'm also willing to bet if they would provide you the breakdown, most of those people who died are between 55-65. (The youngest Baby Boomers today are 57, born in 1964) But they don't break it down like that, they give the range of 50-64.</p>
<p>It's probable that somewhere around 90% of all "Covid Deaths" are baby boomers. But even if it was 100% - that would still only be 0.54% of all Baby Boomers dying in 2020.</p>
<p>Why would it surprise anyone that 0.54% of an aging population died?</p>
<p>What kind of panic are they going to push when that figure climbs to 2% or 3% in years to come?</p>
<p>Now let's look at how they changed counting the numbers: https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Provisional-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-S/muzy-jte6</p>
<p>"Covid Underlying Cause". and "Covid Multiple Cause" of deaths. Nearly every single "Covid Multiple Cause" is counted as a "Covid Underlying Cause"... even though we know that the average covid death had 4+ co-morbidities.</p>
<p>Many of the deaths that would normally be attributed to the other columns of causes of death like Diabetes or Heart failure, etc., as we saw in the Bloomberg article link above. But in 2020 they were tossed into the "Covid" pile to scare you and institute the societal changes in every democracy around the globe.</p>
<p>By changing the way we count things - and timing it right for the Baby Boomers who make up 20% of the population to start dying off in larger numbers - you can create a pandemic out of the common cold.</p>

<p>So, funny story about that... I was "Flagged" for posting a version of this (Not identical in all parts, but some) and autobanned from all those subs that I have never been to. The post was Removed from a few reddit subreddits, but the ones where I texted the mods (like here) re-instated it.</p>
<p>Even some subs like r/conservatives.</p>
<p>Not only that, I've had Reddit remove my meme content from reddit, and then gone to imgur to find the original meme deleted by imgur!</p>
<p>So yeah - the 1984 Ministry Of Truth is real.</p>

        <p>Here is another bit from the original post I made that reddit seems to have on a permaban...</p>
<p>Furthermore, counting all of the deaths as being caused by covid because the person "Tested Positive" is not scientific - because we know scientifically that many people who "Tested Positive" were asymptomatic and never had any symptoms to die from.</p>
<p>https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/over-85-of-virus-patients-in-uk-asymptomatic-study/2000300
&rt;Over 85% of virus patients in UK asymptomatic: Study
New research raises fears of ‘silent transmission,’ increases need for more widespread testing</p>
<p>https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/85448
&rt;Over 85% of COVID-19 Infections in China Went Undetected Early On
— Number of mild or asymptomatic infections emphasizes need for mitigation measures</p>
<p>How can a person with no symptoms from covid die from covid and not their diabetes or heart disease, etc.?</p>
<p>What about the other 94.5% that had at least 1 or more comorbidities? They not only had on average 4 or more comorbidities: They are also old and nearing death from age. This is another very important part of creating "The Pandemic", and also future "Pandemics". Timing it so that a large portion of the population will be dying off anyway, and blaming those deaths on "the pandemic".</p>
<p>According to google, The Baby Boomer Generation (born 1946-1964) Make up 21.19% of the population.</p>
<p>As 21.9% of the population nears life expectancy, Death Rates necessarily go up. It's a larger portion of the population dying.</p>
<p>https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1141.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The baby boom population has been decreasing since 1999, and the decline is projected to continue through 2060 as the baby boom population enters the older ages and succumbs to the forces of mortality. When the first baby boomers turned 65 in 2011, there were just under 77 million people in this population. By 2030, when the baby boomers will be between 66 and 84 years old, that number is projected to drop to 60 million and decrease further by 2060 to only 2.4 million.4 The baby boomers who remain in 2060 will be 96 years and older.</p>
<p>In the graph, figure 2, it is easy to see that Baby Boomers went into decline around 2010. And that decline picks up speed as they get older.</p>
<p>If the study says that there were 77 million baby boomers in 2011... and will be 60 million in 2030... that means 17 million people will die between 2011 and 2030... which means an average of 894,736 need to die each year between 2011 and 2030 to have that decrease in population.</p>
<p>Obviously, averages are not straight lines, and the actual toll will be a bell curve with deaths increasing over time, like the census link above illustrates in the bar graph. But the average helps us set a baseline.</p>
<p>Google also says Population in millions for The Baby Boomer Generation (born 1946-1964) right now in the US is 69.56 million.</p>
<p>According to that census link above, we should have had nearly 8 million die off on average since 2011, but in reality we have had only had about 7 million deaths from 2011-2021.</p>
<p>So the bell curve over the next 9 years to 2030 needs to have about 1.1 million baby boomers dying each year on average to get to the predicted 2030 60 million total. Or about 3 times the number of baby boomers that died in 2020.</p>
<p>When you hear them yelling about an increase of deaths from Covid - Deaths of people who are mostly near Life Expectancy age or older - they are using correlation to imply causation as much as anything else. And that this is intentional.</p>
