    <strong>Liberty in lockdown Is it time to release democracy from quarantine and resuscitate the rule of law?</strong>

<p>“On 23 March the prime minister ordered people to stay at home. The next day health secretary Matt Hancock underscored that these were “rules”, not guidance. But Sumption says: “A huge proportion of the British population do not understand the difference between guidance and regulation. The government said ‘you must’ and people assumed it was a rule, when it was not. I think the government knew people did not understand the difference and exploited their confusion.”</p>
<p>“The lockdown has been enforced mainly through the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, known as the “Lockdown Regulations”, imposed under powers delegated by the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. In addition, the Coronavirus Act 2020 prohibits gatherings, cancels elections and contains the notorious Schedule 21 which allows for you to be forcibly detained, tested, treated and quarantined. The act will be reviewed by parliament this month, and can be revoked if no longer needed.”</p>
<p>“Lockdown was enforced under the Public Health Act, originally designed to immobilise and treat people who are infectious, not the entire population. What made Covid the first disease to merit quarantining an entire population of the healthy? It was feared that the NHS would be overwhelmed. Other countries had already locked down under emergency legislation, setting a strikingly authoritarian template, which surprisingly became the norm across the liberal democratic countries of Europe: “There is a herd instinct in governments and it gave them political cover,” Sumption told me. “Sometimes the best thing is to do nothing.”</p>
