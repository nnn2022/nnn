    <strong>The Crisis in Science Predates Covid</strong>
    <p><p>We are all aware on this sub of how science has become politicised and victim of groupthink with respect to Covid, but actually there has been a growing crisis in science for years, completely unacknowledged by the media who report on the pronouncements of scientists as if they are holy writ.</p>
<p>In 2018, the National Association of Scholars published <a href="https://www.nas.org/reports/the-irreproducibility-crisis-of-modern-science/full-report">“The Irreproducibility Crisis of Modern Science”</a> summarising the state of play. Predicting the current fiasco, authors Randall and Welser point out that, <em>“Sloppy procedures don’t just allow for sloppy science. They allow, as opportunistic infections, politicized groupthink and advocacy-driven science. Above all, they allow for progressive skews and inhibitions on scientific research…”.</em></p>
<p>The crisis is severe. In a 2012 study, aimed at reproducing the results of <strong>53 landmark studies</strong> in hematology and oncology, only <strong>six (11%)</strong> were able to reproduce the findings of the original studies.</p>
<p>An important figure in exposing the crisis will be very familiar to readers of this sub. As long ago as 2005, <strong>Dr John Ioannidis</strong> argued that most published research findings in the field of medicine were false. Contributing factors included, </p>
<p><em>“1) the inherent limitations of statistical tests; 2) the use of small sample sizes; 3) reliance on small numbers of studies; 4) willingness to publish studies reporting small effects; 5) the prevalence of fishing expeditions to generate new hypotheses or explore unlikely correlations; 6) flexibility in research design; 7) intellectual prejudices and conflicts of interest; and 8) competition among researchers to produce positive results, especially in fashionable areas of research. Ioannidis demonstrated that when you accounted for all these factors, a majority of research findings in medicine—and in many other scientific fields—were probably wrong.”</em></p>
<p>It should not come as a surprise then that Ioannidis has been sceptical of the wilder claims of pro-NPI scientists, particularly as many of the alarmist papers during this pandemic have been rushed, not peer-reviewed and using highly questionable methods in arriving at their conclusions.</p>
<p>This is not to include outright fraud, which certainly happens but is hard to quantify. For example, Lönnstedt and Eklöv, published a paper in Science in June 2016, warning of the dangers of microplastic particles in the ocean. The microplastics, they reported, endangered fish. It turns out that Lönnstedt never performed the research that she and Eklöv reported.</p>
<p>From my perspective, I have been appalled at some of the papers I have read. Even though I am not a practising scientist, even I can see that when a report comes to a conclusion based on an analysis of studies, none of which achieved statistical significance, there is something very wrong going on.</p>
<p>Sadly, the “I’m following the Science” mob that unquestionably follow the ridiculous pronouncements of Ferguson, Fauci et al, are blissfully unaware of all this. Shame on them.</p></p>

        <p>Science has been politicised/religiousised for millennia.</p>
<p>Most discoveries and truths have been silenced by both powers, or bastardised to  fit a narrative.</p>
<p>Many scientists are covid vaccine hesitant and also think lockdowns are pointless.</p>
<p>When they say "scientists state..." they mean a small amount on govt payroll.</p>
