        <p>Everyone should always do their own research obviously, but I am personally going to wait a couple years or at least until it’s tested more.First off I already beat Covid-19 and still have antibodies. Secondly, My life insurance company won’t insure those who take the shot.</p>

        <p>That implies doing nothing, which would make us about as bad as eager slaves like you.</p>
<p>It will only go away when people actively oppose: Curfews, tracking bracelets, vaccine passports, requirements of justification to go outside, park benches with "legal seating" restrictions, the destruction of people's means to feed themselves and the use of force by the State.</p>
<p>All violations which Covid fanatics are far too brainwashed to see as fundamentally wrong.</p>

        <p>And yet, every place that goes into lockdown simply never stops doing it. They keep locking down again, and again and again.</p>
<p>A sign of true success would be <strong>fully</strong> reopening after the lockdown and <strong>never</strong> turning back.</p>
<p>Soon, you will be told that being fully vaccinated only grants "limited freedoms".
https://www.rt.com/usa/517544-cdc-covid-vaccinated-guidelines-freedoms/</p>
<p>Or that you cannot participate in society unless you're vaccinated, which isn't exactly freedom. It is government control.
https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/covid-vaccine-banned-sports-cinemas-b117985.html</p>
<p>But I might be barking at the wrong tree, because I don't actually know if you want to be free and have your life back.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the bottom line is that when you allow the government to take away your rights, it is unlikely that you will have them back.</p>

        <p>We know what it would take for a full reopening and countries have done it. EVERYONE would have to stay home for six weeks. The government would have to pay everyone to do so. People traveling out of country would have to be responsible and quarantine. </p>
<p>Selfish Assholes who don't wear masks and are going out to eat/living life like normal are the reason this has been as bad as it has been. Our country has had a disproportionate number of deaths and you have people in this sub saying it isn't real. How fucking stupid do you have to be to think it isn't real?</p>

        <p>Why is a vaccine bad?? It’s a tiny ass needle, 2 days max of arm soreness, and then you won’t get covid. Like why is that something to get angry at your supervisor about? I already know this comment will be well in the negative, but please inform me instead of just hating and calling my comment a “troll” like this sub always has before. I got the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine a few days ago, kinda felt like I got punched in the arm the day after, but I feel fine now and am more than excited to get my 2nd shot and back into society!</p>

        <p>It's not the physical process of getting a vaccine. That's nothing.</p>
<p>The reluctance is mainly due to many people not being comfortable taking a novel vaccine (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are the first ever mRNA vaccines authorized for use in humans) while it's still in its clinical trial without any long term efficacy data or long term data on side effects.</p>
<p>For example, the AstraZeneca vaccine is currently going through a bit of controversy with the whole blood clot thing. Could it be related to the vaccine? Possibly. Could it not be related to the vaccine and just coincidental? Also possibly. But right now that answer can't be fully determined since there's no long term data. So until that can be answered conclusively with long term data and evidence, then taking the jab is a risk of potentially developing blood clots. And that's not a risk some people are willing to take.</p>
<p>If you feel comfortable taking a novel vaccine still in its clinical trial phase because you feel the benefits outweigh the risks, all the power to you. But some people, myself included, don't feel comfortable taking that risk right now. Will I get the COVID vaccine in the future? Absolutely! But not until the clinical trials are <em>done</em> and there's long term data to support their safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>Hopefully this answer gave a bit of insight!</p>

        <p>astrozeneca vaccine isnt mRNA tho, its traditional viral vector.  total strawman to bring up their issues (which i agree are sketchy!!)</p>
<p>if anyone is truly hesitant to get moderna and pfizer because of mRNA, please get johnson and johnson.  its a viral vector like astrozeneca but has a much better design and none of the weird research data issues.</p>

        <p>This?</p>
<p>&rt;given we have a regular process by which vaccines are produced, the only difference is that this vaccine takes a slightly different approach in regard to the actual virus for which it is created. Please do supply evidence if you can, but I don’t see what else Pfizer, Moderna, etc. would change and I don’t see possibles for long-term effects. Again, please do correct me if I’m wrong, but I just don’t see the problem with these “new” vaccines</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we don't have a regular production process for the brand-new vaccine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it's not a slightly different approach it's actually "novel"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>these are new vaccines, not "new" vaccines</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>i don’t think you understand the difference in vaccines here, because you aren't specific, keep saying it's just a little different from dead-virus vaccines, and base all your assumptions on how dead-virus vaccines have performed.</p>
<p>the mRNA vaccines contain instructions for your cells to create a small part of the virus. your immune system then reacts to the virus protein made by your cells.</p>
<p>dead-virus gives you, afaik, the whole thing and your immune system takes it from there.</p>
<p>i don’t know if the resulting immunity is any different, but these are different processes and we can't assume the performance of one type will predict the performance of the other.</p>

        <p>&rt; The thing is, what I don’t understand is that every year a “new vaccine” — flu vaccine — is produced. </p>
<p>Not really actually. I got the flu shot this year and the one I got (FluLaval) is one that's been in rotation for a few years now depending on which strain appears to be the predominant one. And if they make a 'new' one, it's just an inactivated dead version of the virus... Not mRNA or anything novel and never tested at large in people before. </p>
<p>&rt; I’m not big at all on “rights”.</p>
<p>Big yikes!</p>
<p>&rt; but given we have a regular process by which vaccines are produced</p>
<p>Yes, a process that has not been done with these new types of vaccines. The COVID vaccines are <em>not</em> typical vaccines that have a attenuated/dead version of the virus in them. They're not produced at all in the same process as conventional vaccines. Hence why when you get a typical vaccine they ask if you have an egg allergy. Most vaccines have the live virus grown in eggs, then deactivated and put into saline for injection. These vaccines take months to make. Obviously with the COVID vaccines they've tried to rush the process as much as possible given the urgency, so they're trying experimental vaccines like mRNA to cut corners and lower the time. Which is fine if they work - which they appear to be. BUT, again, no long term data is a no from me.</p>
<p>&rt;  I don’t see possibles for long-term effects.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you can't. You still need to test for them. EVERY medication on earth goes through a lengthy clinical trial. Every single one. The COVID vaccine trials don't end until 2023. </p>
<p>&rt; but I just don’t see the problem with these “new” vaccines.</p>
<p>I just want to clear up that i'm not saying there's anything <em>wrong</em> with them. They may be perfectly fine. And if they work, then that's amazing for the possibilities of making mRNA vaccines for other diseases too. But again, my concern is just the rush in development and lack of long term data. These are brand new, so i'd rather wait and see how the trials go before I get injected with one. </p>
<p>&rt; I can’t imagine how a vaccine could cause clots or whatever. There must be some medical reason for the clots, and if the vaccine cannot cause them — although perhaps it can, but I doubt it — then it must simply be a statistical anomaly.</p>
<p>Well, that's what the clinical trials are for. To determine this and answer questions like this. </p>
<p>The only thing i'll say in closing, is that it's not COVID causing this mess. It's governments. COVID will be here forever. It's not going away. There will be a COVID season just like flu season... In fact, both will likely be at the same time given influenza and COVID are showing similar seasonal trends. The 'mess' we're in is because of how the governments are responding. We shouldn't need to take a vaccine to get back to 'normal' (and I don't think mass vaccination will get us back to normal).</p>

        <p>You’re right. It’s a statistical anomaly that you would have lasting negative effects from the vaccine. But speaking of statistics, the chances of dying or having lasting effects from COVID-19 are also on the low, low end. And when is there going to be a way to mourn for those who have died from COVID-19 with a national monument in their honor? I feel like some of the trillions of dollars spent on giving everyone the jab should have been spent on a National Memorial Statue of some kind. But I don’t think that the US really cares about mourning the dead.</p>

        <p>Ok, I can absolutely understand that then. I live in a very big city, so I kind of assume everyone else does too (reader’s bias, that’s my bad). I can see how unfamiliar and somewhat untested drugs can appear dangerous, but I have only good anecdotes of prescription and otc drugs, and I see the vaccine as just something quick like ripping a bandaid off to gain immunity to this pandemic, and get stuff back to normal again. If it isn’t necessary, there’s isn’t a reason to have it, but I feel like for a lot of people (about 70% lol) it should just be done so we can all move on and put this in the history books.</p>
<p>I see where you’re coming from though, there definitely shouldn’t be a vaccine passport for small towns and such that are hardly affected by it. Not really anyone’s gonna bring it in, and it probably wouldn’t get far even if it was.</p>

        <p>Vent time. My dad is actually sick and twisted. Like, actually. This pandemic has brought out such a nasty sadistic side to him and i've lost so much respect for him... It saddens me to even be typing that.</p>
<p>Just to quickly preface, i'm obviously anti-lockdown and anti-restriction for a multitude of reasons. My dad, on the other hand, is pro-lockdown and pro-restriction and watches nothing but the news and has undying loyalty and belief in the 'experts'. So we've had a few disagreements over the pandemic response over the past year, especially here in Canada. And there's constant political tension between me and him now.</p>
<p>I'm in Ontario, Canada and they've just announced that we're going into our 3rd lockdown (which they've re-branded as an 'emergency brake' I guess to be cool and trendy) and my dad was like "well that's what happens when people don't follow the rules. Don't follow the rules? Too bad, lock it down."</p>
<p>So I replied "I disagree". And my dad immediately replies "I know YOU DO but... Who cares?"</p>
<p>So I was like "uh, lots of people".</p>
<p>Then my dad comes up to me and my brother as we're heading out for our walk (which we've gotten in the habit of doing while the news is on) and starts laughing smugly and condescendingly in our face about how the government is "doing the right thing" and how he welcomes more restrictions. Like, i'm not exaggerating... This man was LAUGHING and cackling at how happy he was we were being slammed back into lockdown and was so gleeful about it. Then he was like "anyways time to go watch some good news!". It was actually disturbing. </p>
<p>I'm just so sickened at how thrilled he is about this. Like, it's one thing to be a doomer and think we need restrictions or lockdowns or whatever the fuck you think works for 'containing' the spread of COVID... But to be that thrilled about it to the point that you're laughing and cackling hysterically? It was genuinely disturbing.</p>
<p>Try laughing in the face of small business owners who might have to close up their shops for good this month. </p>
<p>Try laughing to the parents who are mourning the loss of their kid who took their life from this pandemic given the state of the world. </p>
<p>Try laughing to the seniors who have been locked in their rooms for a year now despite <em>begging</em> to be allowed to leave and go outside.</p>
<p>Try laughing to someone on the verge of getting evicted from their apartment due to losing their job and not being able to pay rent. </p>
<p>Easy to laugh and celebrate restrictions being a career established baby boomer with no hobbies or friends working his cushy lawyer job from home. </p>
<p>And we'll see how much he's laughing when the economic recession caused by this pandemic starts to hit full swing right as he's starting his retirement. </p>
<p>I'm just so disgusted and sickened by him. He's twisted.</p>

        <p>&rt; Question about your dad, when you say he “watches nothing but the news”, what do you mean? Is that serious or a bit of an exaggeration? And in either case, what channels? Can you give an example of something he repeated that an “expert” said? Like, does he quote Dr. Tam?</p>
<p>Not an exaggeration at all. Any free time he has is consumed by news. His alarm to wake up for the day is the 6 a.m. news on the radio (CBC radio). Then he gets up and reads the newspaper (typically NY Times and Hamilton Spectator i'm pretty sure are his go to's). Then he goes to his home office and works for a bit, then goes on a walk and listens to CBC podcasts. Then he ends his day with 'The National' on the CBC - the nightly news broadcast... Which is also the news broadcast I just can't be in the same room as when it airs. The manipulation and fear mongering they show each night on that broadcast sickens me and I can see how easily it brainwashes people like my parents. And based on my few arguments i've had with him, he's definitely a product of the news he watches.</p>
<p>As for what he repeats from the experts... It's nothing unique, just the same drivel they always spew. You know, that lockdowns work... It's people that aren't following the rules that cause spread and lockdowns... Seasonality isn't a thing, etc etc... He thinks all the 'experts' and doctors that appear on TV deserve awards and recognition from this 🙄</p>
<p>My dad is 66, i'm 27. Social class we're upper middle class i'd say. Not rich, but we live a comfortable life. He's a corporate lawyer and he's pretty high up in his company so he makes a very good salary... I don't know the specifics, but it's multi 6 figures for sure. </p>
<p>You're definitely onto something with the WASP class though being strict rule followers. I got in a brief fight with my cousin for posting a freedom protest pic on my instagram story and she said the usual shit "look at NZ and Australia! Following the rules works! Not wearing a mask sends a message your rights matter more than the health of someone you love!" etc etc... You know, the usual shit. She's upper class, white, British ancestry, middle aged... My dad is also British ancestry... So I definitely think there's a correlation. </p>
<p>&rt; All the Try- point you brought up are very real. It’s funny how so much of the Canadian Covid propaganda (not sure what it’s like elsewhere) centres around “think of Grandma”, but when is Grandma allowed to decide what she wants?</p>
<p>Mhm <a href="https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/it-s-beyond-appalling-ontario-long-term-care-home-residents-beg-for-release-from-covid-19-confinement-1.5368555">read this.</a> Even seniors in these homes are begging to be let out! And they're the ones we're supposedly protecting... Meanwhile they're still caged up prisoners. It's so so sad.</p>

        <p>Hey! So wow i'm sure you've gotten this before, but I would have never guessed you were 21 based on how you write. You definitely come across as well informed, eloquent and older. But without further ado, to answer your questions.</p>
<p>So I believe my dad is first generation to attend university... I'd have to ask him. It's a bit of an awkward conversation since I didn't go to university and that's always been an awkward point of contention between me and my parents. But idk if his parents attended university since they both were WWII vets.</p>
<p>So the Canadian ancestry. My dad's Canadian ancestry is pretty new-ish. His dad/my grandpa was a Brit who moved to Canada after WWII with his war bride - the warbride's parents were Scottish. But my grandpa was a politician and was always heavily in favor of unionization. So I have to think a lot of his bootlicking came from his dad instilling that in him. Also, being a baby boomer, my dad grew up in an extremely privileged generation of people who experienced one of the greatest periods of prosperity. So I think that shaped things too. He's used to getting rewarded for doing things and following the rules.</p>
<p>Also we are a fairly conventional attractive family. All of us are tall and have good features. As for importance on dressing to fit in... Not that important I guess. When I was younger and in school around my peers I guess it was more important. </p>
<p>My dad definitely is an intelligent guy. He went to law school, so that takes a certain level of intelligence and hard work. But I genuinely do get the vibe he truly does genuinely think the government is always doing everything it can to help and serve people and that the 'experts' always have our utmost safety and interests in mind. He doesn't question anything he's told, he just obeys... And when people question things, i.e. me and my brother, he gets very defensive and confrontational and quite frankly, pretty immature. He always tries to dismiss any opinion we have as being "influenced by Trump" or being "COVID deniers" despite having zero proof we're either of those things. He just lodges out insults like that hoping they'll be true so he can dismiss us. He has no pragmatic argumentative capability, he just gets very immature and gets personal in confrontation... Especially political ones. </p>
<p>Also yeah we live in the greater Toronto area. But we don't have generational wealth.</p>

        <p>Oddly enough, he actually prefers to be in his actual office. So much so that he managed to remain working there well into the first lockdown a year ago when he wasn't supposed to, until they caught onto him and told him he had to work from home like the rest of the company's staff. </p>
<p>But he has a home office set-up that he really likes and has no complaints about it. I think he enjoys it tbh since he can go for walks around our neighborhood to split up his day. He retires in like a year (so he thinks, we'll see what the incoming recession does to those plans) so I think to him this is like, nothing.</p>

        <p>I see, because that would make since why he’s so giddy for the extended lockdowns, but it sounds like he doesn’t mind going in. Sounds like he probably is just caught up in the polarization of all of this by the media. I’d go easy on him, this is a crazy time for everyone and the media really does do a number on people who aren’t aware of their intentions. Try to focus on things you do have in common even if it’s something simple like sports or whatever.</p>

        <p>But the thing is, i'm not even being hard on him. He's the one who shares his ignorant political beliefs, i'll calmly respond, then he'll go off on some childish tantrum on me and my brother. I'm never the one to start any of our arguments, mostly for the reason you mentioned... It's not worth it and I try to just focus on non-COVID and non-political stuff. But I also can't bite my tongue when he shares his ignorant views out loud.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I don't fucking understand my country. Doug Ford is going to enforce a lockdown again after being open for 4 WEEKS. What the fuck. WHAT THE FUCK. Last week cases were down. Now they're up and we're restarting again. "it'll only take 28 days to get us under 1000!!!111!" yeah that's what you fucking said last time Douggie and the lockdown lasted 3 months. Even worse, all of my teachers are telling me to keep a "positive attitude!!" "we'll be back to normal in no time!!" This is never going to end. Or at least that's how it looks. How are we expected to be okay with this? My education, my freedom, and my life are being taken away from me.</p>

        <p>You obviously dont live in Ontario we did comply with all these fucking lockdowns even in extremely rural areas like I live in fucking dirt roads asshoke </p>
<p>Buddy sincerely fuck you I live in Ontario and we are going into another lockdown during Easter because of tyrant ford this is a comment I wrote last lockdown </p>
<p>In Ontario right now I just heard on the news no gatherings of more than 2
people this is utter insanity we have 14 million people and 1,076 million km2 of
land in Ontario.... Compare that to somewhere like the greater Los angles area
that has 18 million people and 12,562 km2..... It is utter insanity
This lockdown we are under is reported to be for the healthcare system which is
under burden but only 285 of our 1349 critical care beds are being taken that's
21% that does not seem lockdown worthy.....
Over 2k small businesses have closed in Ontario alone this year thats sad man!
Not to mention cities like Windsor being caught baking cases to get into the red
for a lockdown
https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k5ta00/i_caught_my_city_
windsor_ontario_banking_cases_to/</p>
<p>August 1st, Ontario has 3805 fewer deaths in 2020 than in 2019
https://i.redd.it/h8wv9azl6kr51.png</p>
<p>Literally my township has had 6 covid deaths since the start of this cuz its rural but we totsll5 lockdown because its trendy and because dumbasses line you believe it </p>
<p>That's why people lost their businesses in my area </p>
<p>Again fuck you from the bottom of my heart I fukcing hate your guts if this is what you believe</p>

<p>It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees</p>
<p>If you tremble with indignation at every injustice than you are a comrade of Mine</p>
<p>Here if you made it this far how about you read the words of someone other than myself</p>
<p>https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/goldman/pdfs/EmmaGoldman_ANARCHISM_WHATITREALLYSTANDSFOR.pdf</p>
<p>Referring to the American government, the greatest American Anarchist, David Thoreau, said: "Government, what is it but a tradition, though a recent one, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each instance losing its integrity; it has not the vitality and force of a single living man.</p>
<p>Law never made man a whit more just; and by means of their respect for it, even the well disposed are daily made agents of injustice."</p>
<p>Indeed, the keynote of government is injustice. With the arrogance and self-sufficiency of the King who could do no wrong, governments ordain, judge, condemn, and punish the most insignificant offenses, while maintaining themselves by the greatest of all offenses, the annihilation of individual liberty.</p>
<p>Thus Ouida is right when she maintains that "the State only aims at instilling those qualities in its public by which its demands are obeyed, and its exchequer is filled. Its highest attainment is the reduction of mankind to clockwork. In its atmosphere all those finer and more delicate liberties, which require treatment and spacious expansion, inevitably dry up and perish. </p>
<p>The State requires a taxpaying machine in which there is no hitch, an exchequer in which there is never a deficit, and a public, monotonous, obedient, colorless, spiritless, moving humbly like a flock of sheep along a straight high road between two walls." Yet even a flock of sheep would resist the chicanery of the State, if it were not for the corruptive, tyrannical, and oppressive methods it employs to serve its purposes.</p>
<p>But at least someone can laugh at my pain at least it's doing someone some good</p>

        <p>Honestly, most people who disagree with you would call you a complete fool, but I’m not like that. I understand your frustration.Here’s my own personal opinion about this whole Covid thing:
A) lockdowns are only effective if they happen once and for a set period of time. None of this half here half there nonsense. We should’ve done a proper lockdown once and for a all for 1-2 weeks. This 3rd lockdown idea is completely pathetic and proves Doug has no clue what he’s doing.</p>
<p>B) the government is wasting so much resources on people that don’t need them, better to spend it on long term health centres for seniors than waste it on people with 97% chance of survival.</p>
<p>C) people should definitely wear masks and distance b/c I don’t see them as an inconvenience, but I’m not gonna blow a fuse and ruin a friendship over it</p>
<p>And lastly, businesses are going to suffer b/c of these “lockdowns”, imo Ford and Kenny(I live in AB), are the worst premiers I have ever seen.</p>

        <p>I am so fucking tired. People who I used to respect are lining up for their shot to “do their part”. My sister and dad almost got into a fight over it at my birthday dinner. This is all so ridiculous. It’s a mild virus. We all die sometime. I don’t want a fucking shot and I don’t want to fucking be a part of this anymore. I’m doing my best to hold strong and I just don’t make a big deal out of the fact that I’m not going to be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Just got back from a mid-sized Texas city (outside the top 20 of population). Won't mention it by name because I don't want them to receive any undue attention - you never know who browses this sub or what power they might have ...</p>
<p>We didn't go into a huge number of places, but all the stores (and hotel) let us walk around maskless with no grief or dirty looks. With the exception of a bar and a regional gas station, most of the employees everywhere seemed forced to wear a mask (often under the nose), but they didn't seem concerned with the customers not wearing them.</p>
<p>As for the customers, it seemed about 50/50 in most places, for mask wearing. What a concept, right? <em>If you feel like wearing one, you wear one, otherwise mind your own damned business</em>.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned bar, holy shit, it was like a time machine: not only were there no masks in sight (neither employees nor customers), they still allowed smoking indoors which was pretty trippy. In the past that would have annoyed me but these days I was just SO FUCKING GRATEFUL to step out of this modern covid-hysteria-matrix to experience a little taste of normalcy. Just people drinking, eating, laughing and having a good time, like, you know, ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY.</p>
<p>There was a large chain gas station in a much smaller town nearby where oddly it seemed like 80+% of the people were wearing masks, but still, the employees didn't seem to mind either way. They greeted us coming in and were very pleasant at the register, no trace of annoyance or aggression.</p>
<p>It was a very refreshing little vacation from a year of misery, and evidence that not everybody has lost their goddamned minds. Normally we live in a larger (top 10) Texas city and it fucking sucks - everybody here is a complete mask zombie and there are no signs it will ever end.</p>

        <p>For weeks now we've been hearing how "muh variants" would cause another surge. In late January Dr. Osterholm described it as a "category 5 hurricane" with the next 6-14 weeks being our toughest yet. Well, while cases have been stagnant for the last month (puzzlingly so but that's a post for another day) this so called surge simply has not happened. And what does the media do? <strong>PRETEND IT IS.</strong> I mean this is a whole new level of fear mongering insanity. How are we ever going to get out of this?</p>

        <p>Once you are vaccinated you will not make your loves ones sick. For people who are at low risk of serious illness themselves, that is the main point of getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Taking precautions to avoid covid after being fully vaccinated is like refusing to go outside because you might get struck by lightning. It is possible, but it is so rare that it is not worthwhile to restructure your life around it.</p>

        <p>That's sucks to hear. The gym is so important for people's mental and physical health. When Gov Wolf closed gyms again last winter again I contacted my state reps about it. Suprisingly one (a republican) wrote me a detailed letter the next day agreeing with me and vowing to fight the governor and the other's (a Democrat) assistant called me and said she completly understood and the gym was imporant to her as well but Wolf was doing this on his own with no input from the legislature. Both said they were against it. Toomey just sent me a follow-up email yesterday which is ok but I know where he stands. Here in PA <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Pennsylvania_Emergency_Declarations_Amendment_(May_2021)">the legislature got an amendment</a> on the ballot that would limit emergency powers. The point I'm making is I'd like to think my contacting my reps helped get this on the ballot and maybe trying reaching out to your reps. It can't hurt and might help.</p>

        <p>I'll give it a shot. I'm usually pretty reluctant on spending time writing letters to gov officials since I just imagine them laughing and tossing in the shredder. I wrote a letter to the premier of my province (our equivalent to the governor) and just heard crickets in response.</p>
<p>I'll try writing to another important member of parliament for my region, see if that does anything. Thanks!</p>

        <p>Are you in Ontario? Because same. I used to go to my community center daily to swim laps and I was in excellent shape. I haven't been since December because despite restrictions being lifted for a bit, my local community center refused to open. I'm just pissed. This lockdown has made my self-esteem plummet. I've taken up running but I'm just so upset about how I look since I stopped swimming. I'm really sorry dude.</p>

        <p>Yes 😩 I mean, i'm grateful my gym even decided to open for the month of March. But it just really really sucks that we're a year+ into this and there's data showing gyms in Ontario haven't led to any major outbreaks or spread and they're STILL closing them. Over it.</p>

        <p>It’s ridiculous. Exercising outside is hard, especially in Canada where it’s cold for about 3 quarters of the year and rains for the rest. Going to the gym and swimming really helped me with my mental health and I just felt a lot better. Also, it’s ok to cry :) it’s actually really healthy. We’ll get through this man 💓</p>

        <p>That's the thing is the 2nd lockdown I couldn't even workout since it was too cold for me to use the little bit of equipment I had (since my house is too small for my barbell and stuff so I had to workout on my back deck). I'll be able to use it for this one, but it's still not ideal at all since what I have PALES in comparison to what I have access to in a gym.</p>
<p>Anyways yeah i'm hoping if this isn't the last lockdown, that the gov at least decides to reassess considering gyms and pools as non-essential. Thank you for your words of compassion :) I echo them back to you! We'll get through it.</p>

        <p>Swine flu (H1N1) as a declared pandemic lasted one year, but it's death toll continues today. It became another in the ever growing list of viruses we get flu shots for to prevent mass deaths. Swine flu as a community spread viral outbreak has lasted over 12 years in its current run. </p>
<p>Hong Kong Flu (H3N2) Lasted 2 years as an official pandemic, but continues today mostly among livestock populations (pigs mainly). This particular version of the flu is the ancestor of the majority of current flu types which continue to pop up as new viruses as they continue to mutate.  </p>
<p>Spanish Flu (The first iteration of H1N1) was an offical pandemic for 1 year, but it's 4 major waves in its debut lasted 4 years, and it continues to spread today. As a virus, H1N1 has killed a total of more than 200 million people in the past 103 years. </p>
<p>Masks and vaccines have saved countless millions of lives over the past 100 years from these pandemics.</p>

        <p>All of those have mutated into much more benign forms, and in no part were masks responsible for that. That's just what viruses do. There was a swine flu pandemic in the 70's with a subsequent vaccine program. I don't think I need to tell you how that went, and that was just for a flu.</p>
<p>But good job on the "akshually the Spanish Flu was 4 years" revisionist history.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the clarity :) </p>
<p>I definitely hear arguments against government mandated mask wearing and social distancing. I haven’t seen much about folks not wanting hand washing, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. I mean, George Carlin has a famous stand up clip addressing germs and his comedic thoughts on hand washing. I hope most of us are at least washing hands :) ha. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, I work hard to be a respectful citizen in my community, and real life has shown me that is what MOST of us are doing. We have not ever and still not do not need our elected officials, who we know to be slimy politicians often influenced by corrupt money, to be given this kind of control over We The People. We are individuals, with individual circumstances, and hold the basic human right to decide what is best for our own bodies.  I believe there is room to disagree while also adhering to basic rights.</p>

        <p>Individuals don't get all the benefits of bureaucracy. </p>
<p>As an individual you wouldn't get any of the things you use on a daily basis. Your pillow, matress, toothbrush wouldn't be yours without the regulations, transport infrastructure, and trade agreements that politicians are responsible for. </p>
<p>As for rights, which of the basic rights are being denied? You don't have the right to enter a private business wearing whatever you want, you have to abide by the clothing laws, for good reason. If a mask is part of those laws, then so be it. It's not discriminatory based on race, sex, age, or class.</p>

        <p>I definitely have a limited understanding around all of the complexities in our bureaucratic government, but I understand enough to know that while some uphold and revere the red tape bureaucracy we work within, I hope we agree that the way our government works is also filled with inadequacy, bullshit hierarchies, and policies that stall any kind of real progress, under the guise of a democracy. </p>
<p>As for basic human rights, I am not speaking so much at mask wearing as I am to forced mask wearing. Same with Covid vaccines. I fully support folks who sign up to be part of the medical trial, but basic human rights ensure we are able to choose what goes into our body, and I would appreciate the heck out of seeing more folks advocate that truth for one another. </p>
<p>What I see is our government, and governments all over the world, playing the role of valiant protector. In the process we are being conditioned to fear one another so much that we are encouraging and applauding the oversteps of power by people we have always known are slimy, financially corrupt politicians who can’t be trusted. </p>
<p>I have much more faith in the common human being than I do the folks who are profiting from all of this. In my day to day real life, I see people living their lives, being cautious and respectful of one another. Our media and social media platforms would like us to believe we are all a bunch of selfish mouth breathers who don’t care about our grandparents, but that simply is not true. We The People are not children who need to be controlled to keep from getting too rowdy. We are intelligent, conscious beings, and are owed the right to live our lives accordingly without unfair stigmas being placed on those who have different beliefs and perspectives.</p>

        <p>I want to add one other important aspect, and that is not everyone can comfortably and safely wear a mask for long periods of time. Before Covid, someone with, let’s say a chronic heart condition, would be able to find employment around their health need that require adequate oxygen intake in a day. Today, that is not even an option, unless remote career is an option. So life for my local grocer, who has worked for the market as a union employee for 15 years, has a worsening heart condition that makes wearing a mask on her shifts a difficult thing. Can she quit and get a different job? Maybe, but it’s not easy to switch entire careers as a 60ish year old. This is only one isolated example of how mask mandates can in fact be discriminatory. Much like the proposed vaccine passport. It’s disheartening for me to hear the argument that everyone needs to be vaccinated, so much so there is suggestion that we provide proof of vaccine, or risk not receiving basic services. The reeks of ableism, and will absolutely further stigmatize the already medically marginalized folks in our Nation. Public safety is vital, and yes the government helps with public health awareness, but public health policy isn’t fully inclusive if we are forgetting so many in the process.</p>

        <p>Lastly, in regards to pillows, toothbrushes, mattresses wouldn’t be mine if it weren’t for the government: while our elected officials push for the policies, they should be led by We The People, also they are funded by the work We The People do. So while credit is due for signing the legislation and writing the shit out and doing the leg work, we can’t dismiss the government is not our overlord and ultimate owner of everything. It’s kind of scary to even consider that. Humans did just fine back before Amazon and Target, we were pretty resourceful when it came to creating the things we need for our well being and survival. If anything, the government’s profit driven takeover is what disconnected us from our innate ability to thrive, without obtuse and destructive consumerism.</p>

        <p>"I want to add one other important aspect, and that is not everyone can comfortably and safely wear a mask for long periods of time."</p>
<p>This argument holds no weight as masks worn properly do not reduce oxygen or increase any damaging levels of any substance. </p>
<p>At the microscopic level, masks block the size of particles that can carry the live virus (specifically water particles). </p>
<p>I've done the math on this because I often deal with different masks at my workplace before covid (OV, AV and P95 masks) and was curious how it all worked. </p>
<p>When you wear a fabric mask, the favric density (the size of the holes in the mesh between threads) will be between 10-35 microns depending on the material, or between 0.1-10 microns if it's a paper, surgical or n95-n99 mask or filter. </p>
<p>Oxygen, CO2, Nitrogen (the main things you breath in and out and require to inhale/exhale freely) are between 0.00029-0.00035 microns. </p>
<p>Now, water particles that can carry the virus are usually around 200 microns (if the virus is outside of a water particle it dies within about 1/1000th of a second), and if they get too much smaller they dry up in miliseconds, too much larger and they weigh too much to float and fall directly to the ground. So all we need to do is prevent things 200 microns from leaving your mouth/nose while allowing things that are 0.00020-0.00040 micros through unimpeded. All current recommend types of masks do this perfectly. </p>
<p>The analogy I gave a while back at my workplace when I showed these numbers and citation (with illustration I wish I could still find) is that the mask on your face is like a chain link fence, the water carrying viruses is a tennis ball, and oxygen, nitrogen, and CO2 are sesame seeds. When you throw sesame seeds at a chainlink fence, 99.99% get through, when you throw a tennis ball at a chainlink fence, it either stops flat or gets stuck. </p>
<p>Here's the full list of measurements:</p>
<p>O 0.29 nm (0.00029 microns)
CO2 0.33 nm (0.00033 microns)
H2O 200 um (200 microns)
N 0.35 nm (0.00035 microns)</p>
<p>Beach Sand - 100-10,000 microns
Viruses 20-400 nm (0.02-0.04 microns)
Covid 19 - 0.1 nm (0.1 microns)</p>
<p>Fabric Porosity:</p>
<p>Wool - 15.75 microns
Tight Cotton - 26.84 microns
Surgical mask - 0.3-10 microns
N95 - 0.1-0.3 microns</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree masks, when worn and cleaned in between uses properly can be helpful. I appreciate the work you did to do the digging on the differences in fabric densities, particle sizes, etc. Common sense tells us, when I sneeze/cough/spit through a napkin, or piece of cloth, the barrier is helpful in grabbing lots of those droplets. 
Where I respectfully disagree, is in what constitutes as a restriction to one’s natural airflow. Yes, masks are designed for breathability, and yes doctors and nurses and all sorts of highly sensitive sanitary workplace environments have spent decades wearing masks as on the job protocol. But before Covid, people who have hearing impairment, breathing issues, claustrophobia, or other various health ailments that otherwise wouldn’t make a person unemployable, are now at a further disadvantage of finding work suited to their abilities. I am not a person who has issues with mask wearing. I wear a mask because it makes my community members feel safer. But I grow concerned when I see our collective fear causing us to ignore a large portion of the world, who in many instances are already stigmatized and often ignored.</p>

        <p>Well, point 1 is simply not true. There are dozens if not hundreds of studies done before covid specifically based on whether face masks stop or slow the spread of viruses and bacteria and other pathogens. In Asia face masks became very widely used after the SARS epidemic, and many studies confirmed the use of them prevented the spread of that coronavirus. Before then there have been countless studies on face masks. </p>
<p>Took all of 2 seconds to find this one from 2007, I don't think that poster even tried to research his statements and instead just said them hoping everyone would blindly agree: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00425893</p>
<p>Point 2; There are rules in most jurisdictions saying in no uncertain terms what qualifies as a face mask. Here in Canada there are federal guidelines on exactly what materials may be used and how thick and how many layers are required for it to be a valid face mask conforming to regulations:</p>
<p>https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/sew-no-sew-instructions-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html</p>
<p>Point 3; perhaps the poster didn't realise he actually proves the contrary point when he says professionals wear masks to prevent moisture from the persons mouth contaminating the work area... that's 100% the reason we are asking all people to wear masks during this pandemic.</p>

        <p>If you click on the results tab it shows the results from the same study, but via link to a different site. Most likely means the study organizers posted the original study idea to a variety of sources seeking funding, and then posted the findings to their prefered source or the one their lab, government, or university is tied to. If you make searching for studies a habit as I have you will see this frequently. </p>

<p>I haven’t seen one as detailed as the one you linked for Canada. I think the OP in that post was making a point around health communications, and how we have propaganda being funded like never before in the public health emergency, and yet, not much of those funds have gone towards spreading clear, concise and fully transparent information for us on what proper mask wearing is. Which seems strange considering it is one of the largest things driving the arguments on a lot of this. If masks are super important, than folks need to be made aware of how to properly use, clean and dispose of them. Especially considering we are facing catastrophic environmental disaster, and the disposable masks, food containers, factories making all the sanitizers for Covid test swabs pumping out ethylene oxide into communities, big box stores and mega billionaires profiting while their truck delivery systems keeping us stuck, all all just adding further destruction and harm the world and its inhabitants. None of it really makes sense to me.</p>

        <p>These studies seem to support my points. The first (despite not being a blind study and despite having a very low completion rate) shows that masks gave wearers a 45% lesser chance of contracting compared to control, which is actually higher than most other studies. The main idea of masks isn't to prevent intake, but to prevent spreading outwards from the infected.This study suggests there could be even better reason to wear a mask than simply to prevent outward spread as they also prevent intake of the virus. </p>
<p>The second study is on p95 vs surgical masks and basically saays they are roughly equal in ability to stop the spread, which makes sense as both use paper fibre as a filter. I do appreciate this study as it confirms that the extra money spent on p95 cartridges is not required for covid protection when a regular cheaper mask could be used with similar efficacy.</p>

        <p>"basic human rights ensure we are able to choose what goes into our body"</p>
<p>This would suggest that transfering virus from one person to another would violate their rights. If you are not wearing a mask and transmit virus or bacteria on surfaces or through air to me, you have similarly violated my rights. </p>
<p>The vaccine protects against that violation of rights by ensuring we are both secure against such penetration past our membranes.</p>

        <p>Unknowingly transmitting a potentially harmful virus is very different than knowingly transmitting one. Like any sickness, or communicable disease, we are morally, and in many cases legally expected to protect ourselves and others from infection. The examples I can think of are, Tuberculosis, HIV, and STD’s. But my question always circles back to, at what point are individuals responsible for the health and well-being of others when it comes with consequence to their own health and well-being? That’s not easy to answer, which is even more reason why obtuse worldwide mandates for the health of everyone can cause real life consequences. Our right to want personal health and well-being is not as selfish as our elected officials and highly paid experts want us to believe. </p>
<p>Again, there is a population of humans who simply can’t wear masks for long periods of time, much like there are populations of people who have been advised by their medical professionals to not be part of the vaccine trial. These rights are clearly outlined within the ADA, and its purpose is to protect folks with varying disabilities from discrimination due to their disabilities.</p>
<p>Ableism is defined as such: “Any statement or behavior directed at a disabled person that denigrates or assumes a lesser status for the person because of their disability.</p>
<p>Or ...</p>
<p>Social habits, practices, regulations, laws, and institutions that operate under the assumption that disabled people are inherently less capable overall, less valuable in society, and / or should have less personal autonomy than is ordinarily granted to people of the same age.”</p>
<p>Here’s a link if you are interested in more on the perspective:) </p>
<p>By the way, thanks for the respectful discord. I sincerely appreciate it.</p>

        <p>Had another discussion via Facetime with my sister about the COVID vaccine. She got her vaxx the other day and asked me if I have changed my mind about getting it. I told her no, I won't be getting it. She asked why and I started to explain why but she was rolling her eyes so I stopped explaining. I'm not going to explain to someone when they have some self important smirk on their face. She said that she doesn't feel comfortable with me visiting her new baby if I don't have the vaccine....even though she has let multiple family members visit before they were vaccinated. </p>
<p>I'm done with her and that side of the family. My dad wants to come visit us this month and I'm considering telling him not to bother because every time he visits, we always get into a discussion about the vaccine. The last visit, he accused me of "loving myself more than my sister's baby". Like....???? What the fuck does that mean. I want to meet my sister's baby but she doesn't want me to and that's her decision. But I'm not going to get an unsafe vaccine just to meet someone's kid.</p>

        <p>There are going to be a lot of families permanently split over all this.</p>
<p>I have a theory that this whole global event is a massive "defrag" of humanity, because of political tensions. We will be forced, en masse, to physically relocate to cities/states/countries more in alignment with our politics. No more living nextdoor to those who want us dead (or functionally dead: removed from all public spheres for non-compliance with their politics - and increasingly that's the normie take on vaccine refusers: that they have no right to even exist)</p>
<p>It's become clear that "live and let live" is gone forever. Wherever you are now, if you're not surrounded by a firm majority of people who think like you, you are putting yourself in great danger if things start to get dicey. And that's more of a "when" not "if", based on the trajectory of everything since 2016 (when political polarization went exponential).</p>

        <p>There are strong opinions on both sides but you're right vast majorities being in one area or another without even spread suggests that isn't going to happen on a large scale. There's obviously going to be a lot of conflict but a whole civil war breaking is highly unlikely. There is always going to be people resistant to the main ideology of any given area that dominates the state. What is coming because of this though that I see is a mass segregation of people but this time not by race. That alone seems to be pretty scary if life boils down to that.</p>

<p>Being a parent I would not like to be struck down with a nasty virus that causes fatigue and serious respitory problems when I'm trying to look after a new baby. </p>
<p>Also I don't think we know how it effects infants that catch it through out their developments stages. It's relatively new - 12 months or so.</p>

        <p>The mask isn't meant to protect you, it's meant to stop you from spreading it. You could have covid but have no symptoms, so wearing the mask lowers the risk of people spreading it. The mask isn't supposed to filter the air, it's meant to slow the air coming out of your nose and mouth, which keeps the virus from floating too far. It also keeps you from accidentally sneezing on people</p>

All I said was that I advised my parents to hold off on getting the AZ vaccine for now just in case. I've never a smile drop so quickly. It was silent for a few seconds so I asked whats up, and they said:</p>
<p>"Well maybe your parents should just die of covid instead then."</p>

        <p>The university is a public university and has to follow the law, it can't just set any rules it wants.Technically, the University is not following the advice of the "experts" as my government does not recommend 2 masks instead of one. Therefore, I am probably entitled to sue the university if they stop me from attending classes which I pay for. I'm sad because I don't have the legal expertise to do so and to stand up against petty tyranny. I never said I wouldn't wear a mask in the campus, I'm saying I'll follow the advice of government experts instead of those the university deems the best. 
Also, wearing a mask can definitely hurt you in the long term, do you think rebreathing your own moist air for 8 hours a day doesn't have long term effects?
Oh, I have rights all right. Anywhere in the world I have rights. If someone tells me I have to be raped to enter their property I can promptly say "No, I don't need to" and sue them. Thats why there is common law, to make sure there are certain rules everyone has to follow, even in their own property</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask for 8+ hours a day absolutely can hurt you as it increases your risk of bacterial infections - you're rebreathing moist air all day, just look at "mask mouth" - that's all bacteria around the opening to your lungs and digestive tract.  Please stop spreading medical misinformation saying something is safe when all the scientific evidence points to the opposite being true.</p>

        <p>Anyone else seriously concerned about the "in a pandemic" phrasing and not "during this pandemic"? As if this is the "normal" response to a pandemic and acting like a normal person is unacceptable in a "pandemic". I think it's just setting up future authoritarianism.</p>

        <p>our only child died a week before their 2nd birthday from brain cancer this january. i posted in a support group for parents that have lost children to cancer, i asked how everyone felt about the global and societal focus on ending coronavirus and not cancer. i prefaced the post with hey this might be controversial so remove it if it’s inappropriate, my intention is to create a judgement free/safe space thread for people to truly express themselves on how they feel about the pandemic and everything that goes along with it. </p>
<p>welp within 30 minutes i deleted the post myself and realized that can’t exist. immediately the comments became a dumpster fire. no one could express themselves without being shamed and ganged up on, we can’t make comparisons because cancer isn’t contagious, we needed to realize that it didn’t matter if our children were living because they would die from covid instead, me personally feeling irritated by the race for a cure to covid while we all had to helplessly watch our children die from cancer was wrong and that i shouldn’t feel irritation at all, arguments and debates, “fact” spitting, “fact checking”, and most interestingly of all to me was that the idea of simply expressing our true feelings about covid was completely rejected by the majority. it’s as though they couldn’t even access how they felt and mindlessly repeated the same propaganda we’ve been hearing relentlessly all year. if they feel happy, hopeful and positive about it all, why is that impossible to say without shaming or attacking someone else? i wonder if the way i phrased it triggered some repressed anger because they never thought of it that way but their minds simply will not allow them to get past the narrative. </p>
<p>anyways i’m sure i’ll have to delete this too because no one can exist or express themselves without being thoroughly analyzed and cross examined to determine whether they are “good” or “bad” based on how the majority feels within that timeline.</p>

<p>This lockdown is wrong, and I think we should be funding cancer research instead of doing the headless chicken at covid.

        <p>You have every right to be angry. It's heartbreaking and unfair. this is not how its supposed to be. He's supposed to be living up the great life and spending time with loved ones doing things he loved. I lost my dad several years ago this very month. I was devastated. I thought his life was taken too early. He was only 66. He was a cowboy, road horses and played by his own rules. I often laugh when I think about what he would be doing today. He died suddenly. I was angry, too. Angry at the driver who killed him...  Angry at the world. Now I think to today... There is no way e would be complying with ANY of this nonsense . Makes me laugh and realize maybe God knew what was coming and knew my dad would have none of it. Maybe it was the right time. I miss him.  So much. Enjoy every moment with your dad. Tell stories. Laugh. Tell him about all the ways he is a good dad and the happy memories you have with him. Make as many memories as you can. Don't let these evil people still your joy and time with your dad.</p>

        <p>Thank you again for the kind words. Its definately easier said than done. Cancer affects people in many ways. His cancer has metastized throughout his body, his brain, blood etc. It gives him mood swings and makes making memories difficult. Chemo is also devastating</p>

        <p>Chemo is poison. It's a criminal. If people only truly understood what cancer really is we would never do this to our bodies. HIs body is working hard to keep him alive. Maybe he'll at least drink distilled water?  I'm sorry you're having to see him struggle. I know its hard for you.</p>

        <p>On the street everyone wears a mask... unless they sit down to eat or if they're drinking while walking, then they take off the mask.</p>
<p>The logic escapes me, how is it safe to stand on the street without a mask, but perfectly safe to sit down without one? Why do you have to keep the mask on, except when you're sucking on a straw? Does that mean if I wear one of those beverage hats, I never have to wear a mask?</p>
<p>This crxp makes zero sense. I'm just going to start to carry around an empty bottle with a straw and just keep it in my mouth constantly, then no one can complain.</p>

        <p>I believe it has to do with the amount of the virus it takes to become active in the human body. E.g. it's safer to be inside with others for 10 minutes than it is for an hour. </p>
<p>Having said that, it seems like the need for a mask outside is kind of pointless anyway. All of the major events have been from people congregating inside rather than out. I think people probably wear it outside to make others feel more comfortable while at the same time they can't wait to take it off when they sit down to eat. 😂</p>
<p>I am not a doctor/epidemiologist though so wth do I know?</p>

I almost didn't think to ask if he and my grandma had been vaccinated yet, and lo and behold, they got them one week ago.  So I guess we will see what unfolds.  :/  This is in Canada.</p>

My grandparents are wasps and probably have deliberately not said which vaccine they have at this point. I will find out eventually and update.</p>

        <p>I also live in a very liberal State. A state that has been my home for majority of my life, and full of folks I tended to agree with socially and politically. It wasn’t until very recently that I, a fairly liberal minded human, began to feel ostracized by own community. Double standards and Us vs. Them mentality has taken over, and people like me, middle grounded, reasonable minded and objectionable to fear mongering has lost common ground with most of the people around me. It makes me wish for the days I could simply pack my bags and cross states. Life doesn’t usually allow for that ease, and the walls definitely feel like they are closing in on some days.</p>

        <p>I spent all of 2019 working towards opening up a small local restaurant in my area. I put my endeavors on hold right before the pandemic officially hit the states. I have watched every single location I looked to lease, be filled with a person’s entire life savings and loans, all close their doors within the year 2020. I drive through my small downtown that was only just rescued from despair thanks to lots of gentrification a few years ago, and it has For Lease signs on damn near every other business property. Words don’t really do justice in explaining how it feels to watch your lifelong dreams and work industry die within a year. I have worked in restaurants for 15+ years, working through every position in an effort to fully understand the business so I could open my own small space one day. Im now facing questions as a upper thirty year old with kiddos like; what does a person with experience like I have do with themself now? The industry is strangely what I am really good at,  I find a great deal of nourishment in the aspect of making someone’s day better simply with a good meal, and kind customer service and truth be told, the money can be damn good. I am having lots of mud life crisis moments at a time when I didn’t expect them :) ha. Maybe that’s part of the point, I guess.</p>

        <p>So, I was talking to this guy (met via a dating site) and we had the unavoidable COVID conversation, and we got into the tricky topic of masks.</p>
<p>I argued that masks were not largely proven to work in a pandemic.</p>
<p>He argued that they were useful because they work in hospitals.</p>
<p>I argued that extrapolating the experience of a hospital to the real world doesn't work because the real world isn't as clean as a hospital, and not everyone in the real world practices the cleanliness rigors of people working in a hospital.</p>
<p>He basically admitted that yes, the real world is not a hospital and taking that into account makes them less effective, but kept insisting that I admit that masks work.</p>
<p>I told him that I'd cop to that as long as he admitted that in the real world, they don't.  </p>
<p>He would not capitulate.  Neither would I.</p>
<p>The difference is, he's the one that kept pressing on me to say that masks work.  I argued, yes, but the only times I said that he should admit they don't is when he pressed me to use the words "yes, masks work".  It was creepy.  Almost as if he was trying to exploit an insecurity and that I deep down really believe that masks work and I was just a dirty antimasker and in denial (for some bizarre god damn reason).</p>
<p>Needless to say, I unmatched myself from this guy.  I don't need anyone in my life that will press me to believe what they do, whether it's about COVID, religion, taxes, the roles of women in relationships or anything else I'm set in my beliefs about.</p>

        <p>Masks are worn in hospitals largely so the surgeon doesn't get spit on patient's wounds and such because it could get infected. It has absolutely nothing to do with a virus. Seriously education has failed us if people don't even understand masks in hospitals are not worn to stop viruses...</p>
<p>Good luck trying to date during this time, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. On ig people are saying they are putting "I don't want to meet until we are both vaccinated" in their dating bio. Lord help us</p>

        <p>Being a woman (and given the inherent asymmetries of online dating), there's no reason for you to even bother with those kinds of conversations. Put something in your profile about how you feel about masks/lockdowns and ruthlessly unmatch anybody who gives you the slightest pushback.</p>
<p>Nobody here needs to justify their opinions on this subject, for any reason, in any context. We've all lived through this nonsense for over a year now. The cultural warfare battle lines are drawn. They aren't budging an inch on their stance, so we don't owe them shit.</p>

        <p>My time to shine!! Lmao. Idk where to begin. I’m just so sick of all this bs. The vaccine passports, for example?? This can’t possibly be put into place (I know dumb*ss Cuomo already did) because not everybody wants to get the vaccine right away. They’re either like me who doesn’t want it in general, or they’re waiting. They can’t penalize people for choosing what to do with their own bodies. If you’re on the edge then you shouldn’t be forced to get the shot. It’s ridiculous and it’s never gonna work if enough people get fed up and say “enough is enough.” I’m so so sick of it. Herd immunity comes up again but it’s also about basic hygiene and taking care of yourself. If you’re living your life worrying about other people then you’re not living. Just do you. Eat healthy. Stay healthy. I’m tired of other people jamming their paranoia down other people’s throats. Not everybody wants these damn premature vaccines so stfu and stop acting like they’re the bad guys. Again, enforcing vaccine passports is just a false sense of security for people. Like what’s it actually gonna do??</p>

        <p>I know someone who had the virus. Nearly 60 years old, heavy drinker, fat, smoker, very poor lifestyle. He was totally fine. I know of many more people who died of other causes (normal stuff that people die of every year, like car crash, suicide, cancer, etc). People are not immortal, they are going to die, and it's most likely not going to be from this bad flu. I'm sure everyone except possibly doctors working in the ER can tell a similar story about their own lives - hardly any "flu" deaths, plenty of people dying because that's life. Why aren't they making the connection and waking up?</p>

        <p>My mom's friend works in a LTC home. One of the residents contracted COVID-19 from her son, who later tested positive. She had a mild illness and made a full recovery. Her son, on the other hand, couldn't cope with the guilt of giving his elderly mother COVID... So he took his own life. </p>
<p>The media is 100% accountable for his death. Their constant fearmongering blew this virus up to sound like Satan reincarnate and is ultimately to blame for him being so distraught about passing it to his mom.</p>

        <p>Bill sincerely fuck you I live in Ontario and we are going into another lockdown during Easter because of tyrant ford this is a comment I wrote last lockdown </p>
<p>In Ontario right now I just heard on the news no gatherings of more than 2
people this is utter insanity we have 14 million people and 1,076 million km2 of
land in Ontario.... Compare that to somewhere like the greater Los angles area
that has 18 million people and 12,562 km2..... It is utter insanity
This lockdown we are under is reported to be for the healthcare system which is
under burden but only 285 of our 1349 critical care beds are being taken that's
21% that does not seem lockdown worthy.....
Over 2k small businesses have closed in Ontario alone this year thats sad man!
Not to mention cities like Windsor being caught baking cases to get into the red
for a lockdown

windsor_ontario_banking_cases_to/</p>
<p>August 1st, Ontario has 3805 fewer deaths in 2020 than in 2019
https://i.redd.it/h8wv9azl6kr51.png</p>
<p>Literally my township has had 6 covid deaths since the start of this cuz its rural but we totsll5 lockdown because its trendy and because dumbasses line you believe it </p>
<p>That's why people lost their businesses in my area </p>
<p>Again fuck you</p>

        <p>You would think that... until you actually look at a timeline of new cases.  Then you'd  find out that new cases absolutely skyrocketed after lockdowns were instituted, then slowly tapered off.  And that these graphs are almost identical in areas that did not institute lockdowns.   Areas that have lifted lockdowns, like Texas and Florida, are seeing fewer new cases than those still under lockdown.  I encourage you to look at the actual numbers reported on the CDC and WHO's sites, instead of just watching propaganda.   By all means, please fucking prove me wrong, I beg you.</p>

        <p>And they are also the reason many more people have untreated cancer, diabetes, heart disease etc. It's not ok to make someone die because their doctor's appointment is cancelled in order to leave room in the hospitals for the surge of virus patients who haven't come yet.</p>

        <p>Does everybody want a fast forward button IRL? It’s been too long, it’ll be 2 years absolutely wasted, nothing at all achieved. How long do we go? I was supposed to take over a property for a business just before Covid, I would 100% be bankrupt if I did. But it’s alright, at least the massive companies are making billions while the little guys get screwed.</p>

        <p>Right, I have seen the seatbelt argument crop up AT LEAST three separate times now, so let’s lay out why it’s fecking stupid.  ‘Oh yeah you don’t think these measures should be in place?  Well what about seatbelts, HUH???’</p>
<p>Seatbelts do not cause suicides.  Seatbelts do not cause cancer deaths.  Seatbelts do not disrupt immunisation services and food transportation, leading to thousands of deaths every day in war-torn countries.  Seatbelts do not set a terrifying precedent for governments to basically do whatever the hell they want with us because they pretty much know we’ll comply with even the most oppressive measures.  Seatbelts do not create poverty.  Seatbelts do not increase obesity.  Seatbelts do not cause an increase in substance abuse.  Seatbelts are not bad for your health.  Seatbelts do not cause depression.  Seatbelts do not make children unsocialised.  Seatbelts do not steal a year of your life.  Seatbelts do not prevent loved ones from seeing each other.  Seatbelts do not reduce quality of life.  Seatbelts do not force the elderly to live out the last few months or years of their lives in loneliness and anguish, without even the comfort of knowing their family will be able to put a comforting arm around each other at the funeral.  Seatbelts do not shorten lifespans.  Seatbelts do not infringe on freedom.  Also... seatbelts <em>work</em>.</p>
<p>Seatbelts and lockdowns are not comparable.</p>
<p>Next time I see this god damn argument, I’m just going to copy and paste this rant.</p>

        <p>Well the day I have not been looking forward to just happened.  Appointments for experimental viral vector or mRNA shots are open to all adults in my area.  My employer had a meeting encouraging everyone to get the shot so we can reopen the office.  I stayed silent. I will never get it.  Should I continue to stay silent, and if anyone asks say I do not want to discuss that? Should I lie and say I got the shot? It's a small employer and I'm confident theyll never check if I did.  Should I tell everyone where I stand and possibly risk job loss or not being able to come into the office?</p>

<p>If there is a medical reason for you to not have it then don't get it and tell them. If you beleive that is is unsafe for some other reason then tell them that. Do not hide who you are. If you are ashamed of who you are then maybe it is time to reevaluate your life.</p>

        <p>To be honest, this is way too combative and confrontational. If one of my employees reacted like this to a meeting encouraging people to get a vaccination I'd consider this a pretty major red flag. It's much better to keep your head down and stay quiet if you're only interested in self-preservation. </p>

        <p>Cite HIPAA.  Compare it to your employer asking if you were HIV positive.   They have no right to know, and you can literally sue them just for their asking.</p>
<p>Edit, I'm wrong, HIPAA only applies to healthcare providers, insurance companies, and their vendors.  Your employer is free to ask you for your medical records, but you have no legal obligation to comply.  Your doctor or insurance provider must ask you before giving records to your employer.  If they share records without permission you can sue.  Also employers cannot require employees to take the Pfizer or Moderna jab under US federal law as this is explicitly stated in the Emergency Use Authorization of the drugs.</p>

        <p>Does anyone else feel like the debate/controversy about “vaccine passports” and businesses requiring vaccination will end up similar to “contact tracing” in the US last summer?</p>
<p>Feels like something that will fade quickly once people really start to realize the logistical and privacy/legal issues involved. </p>
<p>Once shit opens back up most businesses aren’t going to lose customers and revenue trying to deal with it. Once a large enough percentage of businesses don’t follow through the big ones that actually have the resources to do it will follow suit. </p>

        <p>I read some of the peer reviewed articles. They are an analysis of other peer reviewed articles, of which they hand selected. Even among the articles they choose to include they mention significant evidence that wearing a mask prevents people with a viral load from spreading the infection. Which is the entire point of the mask mandates.</p>
<p>I.e. “However when a pre-specified analysis restricted attention to 154 households in which the intervention was applied within 36 hours of symptom onset in the index case, statistically significant reductions in laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in household contacts were observed in the face mask and hand hygiene arm”</p>
<p>They also don’t say masks don’t work for preventing a healthy individual from getting infected, they do mention there is less evidence.</p>
<p>So masks do work according to this link, with a very negative sounding headline.</p>

        <p>Thanks for bringing attention to asymptomatic transmission. That is another area the science doesn’t make sense. We have been told Covid, unlike any other virus before, can spread asymptomatically. But then we are told the reason the vaccines help limit transmission is because it limits symptoms in subjects. The studies have shown us Covid isn’t replicating in the lungs as quickly in the vaccinated population, but it also shows the Covid virus is still actively replicating in nasal cavities. So does that mean the science is showing us that despite the viruses presence, if the carrier isn’t symptomatic, they are less likely to spread it? If so, then even more doesn’t make sense. We have been testing asymptomatic people and mandating a worldwide lockdown with mask wearing ordinances, conditioning us to believe everyone around us might kill us or our loved ones with a virus that the person is not showing symptoms of. It makes me wonder if the old rule of common sense would have been better applied here, for instance, encouraging folks with sick symptoms to stay out of public areas, like we all usually did anyways, before we bent over for further government controls like what we are seeing.</p>

        <p>Fair fair. Can you help me understand what constitutes as a “right-wing think tank”? The links I provided directly source us to published, peer reviewed science journals. The tricky part is, it’s hard to find these science journals without accidentally interacting with a “right-winger” because the leftists have deemed it “harmful” to address the decades of science previous to the current Covid 19 mask wearing mandates. </p>
<p>One of my links I posted is of a widely respected expert telling us why masks are more harmful than helpful. You can’t be suggesting a trusted MSM expert is a “right winger”.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what exactly you are referencing. But in case it matters, I also support vaccines. I just choose to wait until the medical trials are complete, the data is collected, published, peer reviewed, and given full FDA approval.</p>

        <p>Went to church today and the man preaching started off talking about how he had to go to a funeral of two of his students' father who died of covid and went on about how people who are against wearing masks and social distancing still did so out of respect at the funeral. He talked about how no matter out political stance, we should do what's best for others and wear masks.</p>
<p>My issue with this was
1. There was no reason to bring this up as it didn't even tie into his message AT ALL though he tried hard to make it
2. Commenting about how this is political makes it even moreso political and it was an unnecessary thing to add
3. I'd like to go to church to get away from this nonsense but no dice</p>
<p>I'm over this whole thing. That's my rant</p>

        <p>Thankfully it was just this week and he was a guest speaker. But overall, at that church people aren't worried about social distancing and wearing masks all the time which is a reason I started going in the first place. But gosh, was that something I did NOT need this week</p>

        <p>About to head to a family Easter dinner that I very nearly skipped, and might walk out of. It's just 5 people total, including 3 from my household. One fully-vaccinated relative refused to attend because she feels my kids and I could give her Covid. The rest of the family, even one in another country (all doomers), apparently discussed it with her in advance, and not one person encouraged her to attend. They are all saying that if that's how she feels, then that is her right. Of course it is - but will they defend my right to not wear a mask today, and to not get the vaccine? I have to say I'm pretty hurt for my kids and I to be considered so "dangerous" and infectious. The family members hosting are fully-vaccinated too.</p>

        <p>I feel like I am missing a crucial part of info, but what’s the logic with people who got the vaccine who still are afraid of covid and in support of vaccine passports? And if they are not planning to resume to their regular lives after having the vaccine, then why even take it?</p>

        <p>I think the “official guidance” is that fully-vaccinated people can mix freely with each other, but not with the unvaxxed. I don’t see how that makes sense - vaccinated people can still get Covid, and in fact I know some who have, so what difference does it make? </p>
<p>I believe the narrative has changed from “lessen the severity of symptoms” to “achieve herd immunity by vaccinating almost all of the population”. </p>
<p>I actually stormed out of the gathering. It’s a long story, but I was asked if I’d signed my kids up for the vaccine - with the presumption being that I obviously would  - and then my ex texted me and told me that they WILL be vaccinated ASAP or he’ll take me to court. I was DONE. They’re not even old enough yet, but the age requirements keep getting lower.</p>

        <p>I'm no antinatalist but I am increasingly grateful I never had kids - this whole ordeal is stressful enough as an adult who can mostly isolate from the institutional madness going on around me.

        <p>Eh, I've seen what growing up heavily dependent on digital devices / the Internet has done to young people. It's really stunting humans as a whole - widespread anxiety and depression and alienation in young people wasn't a thing back when I was in school.</p>
<p>So add another extreme layer on top of that - near-complete isolation in some cases, plus masks, plus a relatively large chunk of their life lost to this whole charade (vs. older adults for whom a few years are just a small fraction of their lives). It's not going to do them any favors, psychologically.</p>
<p>For adults whose brains are already developed, yeah, it's definitely an opportunity to face some serious adversity that we've only read about in far-off lands for a very long time.</p>
<p>Also it's going to create a generation of complete germaphobes, so that's sad.</p>

        <p>I think you have it backwards. The original idea for the vaccine was to achieve herd immunity, as it is for existing vaccines.  However, the new nRNA technology has proved so effective that it appears to be 100% effective at preventing severe illness requiring hospitalization for those individuals vaccinated. Like all vaccines, there is a small segment of the community who are not recommended to get it, sometimes for allergies. Herd immunity is the best chance these individuals have for getting some enhanced safety.</p>

<p>My brother is a mask scoffer. We avoid him because he actively courts infection. They just returned from Jamaica and - hey, guess what? - - covid. He wanted to host Easter, despite his "cold." Our mother is 82. He could have killed her.</p>

        <p>No one in their right mind advocates for people with flu-like symptoms to be exposed to the elderly.  But when he recovers and is no longer showing symptoms y'all can start hanging out with him again, because there is no such thing as asymptomatic spread and once you've gotten covid and developed antibodies you can't get it again.

        <p>|what’s the logic with people who got the vaccine who still are afraid of covid and in support of vaccine passports?</p>
<p>You didn't quite answer the question though.  You said you were vaccinated, and that you won't hang out with your brother because he won't wear a mask, but never explained why.  Then you said your covid-positive brother wanted to host easter with your 82 year old mom (everyone agrees that this is a bad idea) but you never indicated if your mom is even vaccinated or not.  Also, you never said whether or not you are in favor of the vaccine passports.  That's likely the reason for the downvotes.</p>

        <p>I think I was pretty clear. Vaccination will prevent me from being hospitalized, but it won't prevent me from getting sick in a world where we don't have herd immunity. I don't want to get sick with covid, even a mild case. There are too many unknowns. We know covid can be harbored in organs, especially the heart, even after mild cases. Therefore I do not want to hang out with people who won't wear masks and who are generally careless about their contacts. </p>
<p>Where were vaccine passports even mentioned? I have no opinion on them at all. What a stupid reason to downvote someone.</p>

<p>He just traveled to Jamaica. We are not supposed to be traveling now. He and his wife have not stopped any activities. I avoid them. Yes, if he died, I would not feel badly about avoiding them right now. That doesn't mean I don't care for him. I just dropped him a pulse ox and gave him instructions on when to go to the ER and (although he probably won't listen).</p>
<p>You seem to want things both ways. I can love someone but not approve of their actions and not want the same risks they take for my own family. If he wants to travel, that's his choice, but we are not going to socialize with them. I do not wish him ill, but I do think he took stupid risks and now he's reaping what he sowed.</p>

        <p>Selfish how? I’m not even eligible for the vaccine, nor are my kids. I didn’t selfishly cut in line ahead of others. No one asked us about wearing masks. How can I be selfish when I can’t even GET the vaccine? I don’t want it, but that’s beside the point. Only one family member stayed away.</p>

        <p>No one has to ask. We have medical professionals for a reason. You're selfish for refusing to put a piece of cloth over your fucking face like millions of people ALREADY DID every day before the pandemic in hospitals worldwide. Since the pandemic, it has been more widely proven to stop the spread of disease. No one is calling you selfish for not vaccinating when not eligible. You're selfish because of your refusal to comply with anything that medical professionals far smarter than you have concluded works. I have my degree in epidemiology. Everyone wore masks in 1918. Everyone got vaccines when available because they knew people would die otherwise. It was common sense. You not wanting the vaccine is the entire point. You don't care if people die needlessly because of this. You're despicable, I feel sorry for you</p>

        <p>Fair enough. If you're really backed into a corner, you could always fake a vaccination card (until digital passports are the norm).</p>

        <p>I don't see contract tracing or vaccine passports being rolled out on a mass scale in a country like the US. I think certain countries (particularly in Asia and West Europe) will be able to get away with it and the overton window will shift to having a more favorable view of them over time but at least there is still a relative level of independence in the US and logistically, businesses that make people get a vaccine before entering will most likely get a decent amount of push back.</p>
<p>That being said, the collectivist notion that "anti-vaxxers" (anyone who doesn't want experimental gene therapy) are endangering everyone will continue and I fear the travel restrictions like having to prove you don't have covid before leaving or entering the country, will never disappear similar to the TSA, unless more people get serious about demanding these restrictions be removed. Masks will most definitely never go away.</p>

        <p>I agree that businesses trying to prohibit those non vaccinated will not go well. Maybe it will work for small businesses in places like the Bay Area or NYC. But even Home Depot has a mask mandate but depending where you are a good half of the customers don’t wear one. Trying to enforce vaccination passports would be a nightmare for most businesses</p>

        <p>So last year (actually, planned to go since 2019), I wanted to go to the Georgia Ren Fest, cuz that's the kind of nerd I am.  Even had the whole Aragorn cosplay ready to go, complete with growing my hair out.</p>
<p>Then the Coof happened.</p>
<p>First, the festival got delayed.  But hey, going in fall sounded great!</p>
<p>Then it got cancelled.  Lovely...</p>
<p>It was announced earlier this year they'd be getting back to their regularly scheduled programming.  I held out some hope.  Then, last month, their website got updated with <a href="https://www.garenfest.com/urgent-news">this</a>.</p>
<p>Nope.  Screw it.  I'm sick enough of wearing these damned muzzles indoors; I sure as hell am not gonna wear it in the boiling humidity of a southern summer, costume or no costume.  I'm not giving my money to these establishments who bend their knees to the fear-mongering either.  I'm sick of this crap, and I'm sick of the sheep on their Facebook page and elsewhere defending mask mandates like good little Chinese citizens.</p>

        <p>This week I’m returning to Canada refusing covid tests do due medical concern because use of ethylene oxide. I know they can’t refuse entry I’m just hoping to not get ticketed. I know I can take it to court but I would rather not have to deal with all of that. Anyone know where I can find border crossing tips or success stories?</p>

        <p>You can refuse to get tested and refuse that ridiculous hotel stay. They'll try to intimidate you but just hold your ground. You WILL get a ticket for about 3500 but it's utterly baseless and will be thrown out in court.

        <p>It makes things a lot easier. You can get around the mandatory test if you refuse at the land border. There is a line in the Quarantine Act which states that you have the right to refuse it no matter what they say. They may say you must go to the hotel for refusing the test but just like the test you can refuse you may not be able to avoid the fine though. I highly recommend reaching out to Chris Sky via instagram (Realchrissky) or cell phone. He's been helping people such as yourself stand up to these ridiculous rules. I know a few people who've been helped by him and it's worked. Let him know your situation and he'll help you out for sure, good luck!</p>

        <p>Lol. Right. I’m going to take a government mandated test where they don’t disclose what’s in the test, when the reality is that there is public knowledge that there are carcinogens in the test. If you don’t have symptoms and you are quarantining anyway, why the heck do you need the test? Why take something you don’t need? And why take something you don’t need if there are known risks?</p>

<p>Healthcare professionals say it is safe. Doctors I have known since childhood tell me it is safe. Scientists who have studied this their entire life tell me it is safe. Common sense tells me it is safe.</p>

        <p>All my family members and even my close freinds ste compliant with all this bullshit and it just makes me so fucking angry whenever I bring up shut I am the black sheep to the point that we get into arguments and they just refuse to accept anything and say well that's my opinion</p>
<p>I just can't like these were people I loved I still do but I can't take them sitting and talking about this like ts all just it's all a coping mechanism because they dont want to accept this is wrong but thats just my opinion</p>
<p>I live on Ontario canada maybe that'swhy everyone here is a conformist compliant dfuck and I fucking hate it so much</p>
<p>I just can't do it anymore we were having dinner at my gramas and the second I leave the table they talk about the vaccine and masks and my grandma is saying joe important she thinks masks are and this hullshit </p>
<p>And my mom goes out for a smoke and when i try to vent to her I just get shot down and argued with and told the opinion line I let her vent all the time</p>
<p>And i got no siblings </p>
<p>All i want is one person in my real life that i can talk to that agrees with me that this shit is not just </p>
<p>They r so hypocritical they will say shut like we gotta keep supporting this take out place so they will make it through </p>
<p>And then I reply and say well maybe if you did not shut them down in the first place that would be the best way to support them</p>
<p>But that's just my opinion you know </p>
<p>I'm so fuxking done obv they are family I will love them forever but I never knew you could have feelings like this for people you love and my mom has done some shitty things to me it's not a anger at her because of what she did to me I'm frustrated because they dont see how clearly wrong all of this is </p>
<p>And we live on a farm in a rural area no reason to be like this it all started with my dad complying with the news than my mom complying with him</p>
<p>I can still vent to my mom sometimes she is better than my dad</p>
<p>Like I said I done I can't do it anymore while writing this comment in riding home with my parents and the radio station guy said my arm is a bit sore got my vax the other day call this number Ontario wide to get yours...</p>
<p>That's paid for he knew the number </p>
<p>Just a couple examples that make me wanna tear my hair out</p>

        <p>What was being controlled. Masks aren’t controlling or preventing you from doing anything. Lockdowns just make their own economy suffer. The rich just got richer b/c they own huge businesses to deliver stuff to ur door. So tell me, where’s the control</p>

        <p>Masks don't control you, true, but they're an instrument of control because they serve as a visual reminder, which reminds people to keep this nightmare going. And yes, the economy is suffering, but like you said, it's all been beneficial to the rich and powerful, not people like us. As for where's the control, it's all around us. People have grown accustomed to the idea that rights can be taken away at any time. They're already talking about climate change lockdowns in the media, for example. Human rights have no longer become inalienable in the eyes of the populace.</p>
<p>But if you want a more concrete example of control, look at the vaccine passports that are coming out.</p>

        <p>The masks thing I can see where you are coming from so I’ll leave that, for the economy, again they are really just exploiting their own resources(the gov.), and just destroying themselves they r losing all their money, it wouldn’t make much sense to do that.
As for vaccine passports wouldn’t it make sense that a country would want their tourists/travellers to have proof of vaccination?
(Not saying I’m pro-vaccine but it is logical).</p>
<p>As for climate change I’m not too educated on the topic. What rights have been taken away btw?</p>

        <p>In the short-term, it might not financially benefit governments, but what happens when the small businesses, the mom and pop shops, are gone, which many of them already are? Everyone relies on the big corporations that have been deemed "essential". Regardless of whether you think it's an agenda, you must see that the people financially benefitting here are certainly not us. </p>
<p>As for vaccine passports, it's not at all justified to require that people inject an experimental technology (which isn't even technically a vaccine, by the way) for a minor virus just so that they're allowed to leave their country. But even if you agree with it for travel, look at what's happening in Israel. They need proof of vaccination to shop, to go to places like movie theatres, to do just about anything. How can that possibly be justifiable? You should not have to undergo ANY medical procedures to live your life.</p>
<p>And regarding what rights are being taken, well, outside of the massive right to bodily autonomy infringements that come with vaccine passports, we've also been not allowed to leave our homes, to see our friends and families, to eat in restaurants, to go just about anywhere or do just about anything, or to exist without a mask in many places. How is all that not our rights being taken away, something that's supposed to be inalienable?</p>

        <p>Financially yes you are correct and I 100% agree and can certainly see why I was wrong before. Big corporations such as Walmart should not be deemed essential if small businesses aren’t.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine passport topic, I feel that the government believes that this is more to help others and to stop and prevent a disease. In their eyes, if you don’t have the vaccine you are more likely to spread the virus which would inevitably prevent you from doing somethings. It’s kind of like whether or not to bring bear spray on a camping trip. Some areas require you need it and if you don’t have it you can’t enter, but you can still explore the rest of the place. </p>
<p>For the rights, I do feel that we are being restricted with who we can see and when but it seems it’s more for safety. I’m not too sure how I feel about this topic of rights but I wud like to discuss the passports</p>

        <p>Does the government REALLY care about health, though? All we've been hearing about from them is stuff that enables them to have control, and the vaccines, which by extension also lead to control due to vaccine passports. If it were about health, we would be told to exercise, lose weight if a person is overweight, get sunlight, take things like vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc, etc etc. (All things proven to help reduce the risk of dying from Covid). But we hear none of these things. We're just told to do things like stay inside (thereby leading to less exercise and sun exposure), stay away from others, and bathe in hand sanitisers. This excessively sterile and germophobic lifestyle that people are living is just going to lead to weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Also, what about all the health problems going undiagnosed like cancer, the delayed treatments and surgeries, the skyrocketing suicides, overdoses, alcohol abuse, and obesity? Doesn't health matter there? Why aren't they caring about those things?</p>
<p>Overall, I think it's a mistake to think that the government cares about us. We wouldn't still be living this way if they did, considering that Florida has been about middle-of-the-road regarding Covid deaths, despite a lack of restrictions, and their cases have been declining.</p>

        <p>Doctors round here only push flu vaccines for young people if they are higher risk (eg chronic illness) or if they're at a point in their education where they have a lot of important exams. To me that makes plenty of sense. At some point logic got thrown out the window and everyone's obsessed with the mrna shit.</p>

<p>1) You are going against doctors
2) You are going against decades of research
3) You are ignoring facts
4) You are putting your child's life in danger
5) You are putting those around them in danger
6) Someone calls you out on it</p>
<p>You are the bad person in this scenario. You are making the world a worse place every day you are in it. You might as well be saying "I hope my child gets sick, I am not going to do the proven things that will prevent that"</p>
<p>Where is your evidence against vaccines? Is it in memes on Facebook and reddit? Do you commiserate with a small online group of toxic people who can't think? If so you may be in the minority for a reason. There is little to no evidence against vaccines, there is overwhelming evidence for them.</p>

        <p>For the past 10 months or so I've been in the camp of "Covid19 is real, it isn't a hoax, but I don't think a dinky little paper mask is going to make me safer."</p>
<p>Up until today I wore one anyways, because I didn't want to give grocery store workers a hassleand be "that guy."</p>
<p>Today I figured what the hell, I'll keep it in my pocket.  Said hello to the person by the door, shopped a bit, asked someone where a certain food item was, got checked out, told two employees on the way out to have a great day.</p>
<p>Went fine.  No one looked at me funny, got mad, asked me to leave etc.  Felt nice.  Might try it again tomorrow when I grab a few beers after hiking.</p>

        <p>I was actually very curious to see how the sheep would react to a counter argument vs the msm narrative. I didn't get one counter point, debate, or anything. </p>
<p>It's literally deflections and that tells a lot about the mentality these people have. Almost like trying to debate with a religious person.</p>

        <p>Do you want an actual answer or are you posting into your echo chamber to have your opinion confirmed?</p>
<p>An actual answer is that some people cannot get the vaccine, they are relying on you for protection. Also, the more people with the virus and spreading the virus results in variants of the virus popping up, which can be more harmful/contagious/deadly. So getting the vaccine helps prevent that because it helps your immune system prepare to fight it.</p>

        <p>Started going for walks. The side walks are not big enough to social distance so when passing someone, one person will usually step off on to the grass. I do it only for old people. Or for women so it doesn't look like I'm hitting on them. But when its another man not too old I'll try not to go on grass and when they do the same it is a good day.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I was simultaneously disgusted at doomers' fanatism and my own cowardice.</p>
<p>I had this little argument with a coworker who said we need 70% of the population vaccinated. I talked about how much science revisionism goes into the entire idea and that a vaccine that merely lessens symptoms is no vaccine at all.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when she paused almost as if something inside her just clicked, before the programming kicked back in and she went back to the original point.</p>
<p>And after that... I left for some coffee so I wouldn't have to hear any of this crap as even more doomer talk started between my coworkers.</p>
<p>I should have stayed. I should have mentioned all the examples of brutal tyranny happening right now. </p>
<p>The other thing that disturbed me was the change in one of my colleagues.</p>
<p>During all of last year, he never displayed any fanatism. But yesterday, he angrily said that people selling fake vaccines are guilty of deliberate murder.</p>
<p>Of course, selling fake vaccines is wrong, but if he would make this comparison to <strong>murder</strong> then he definitely thinks the same of "activities that spread the virus".</p>

        <p>Ya know what? We're all in uncharted territory here. I too have been shocked into silence a few times by the obviousness of the brainwashing in what I used to think were intelligent people (and they probably still are, just hijacked by fear). A lot of times silence is the best option in that moment, rather than saying something hurtful that will add to the "divide and conquer" strategy being used on us. So maybe give yourself a little gentleness around the fact that you were blindsided? Once you have had some time to process their viewpoint, maybe you can find a diplomatic way to plant some seeds for thought in these people. Had you yelled at them in that moment, their walls would have gone up and they definitely wouldn't have had a chance to consider alternative viewpoints.</p>

<p>Fuck all the unemployed, suicides, mental health issues, opioid addictions, missed cancer screenings then right?  All are okay if we lockdown for 13 months to save 3 months of grandma's nursing home times?  </p>
<p>Sometimes I feel doomers like you are just not capable of understanding risk/reward ROI.</p>
<p>But ya, my city is at like 80% of the weak already vaxed (and probably only 85% even want it).  It's time to live again m8.</p>

        <p>Have you not looked at the death rates... it's almost exclusively old people.  This is a fact...  The couple random 'young' tend to be 400lbs and/or with major pre-existing health issues. </p>
<p>You can categorize people by their inability to recognize when the cure is worse than the disease.  The goal was to flatten the curve to avoid hospital over-crowding... at least in Chicago we never got close (even spent $1.7M per patient for a pointless field hospital).</p>
<p>The vaccine is widely available.  Get it if you want it, just don't force others to stay in the bubble with you forever...</p>

        <p>I sometimes have to wear a half mask with filters because of the chemicals which I use are far more dangerous than Covid. Why would they not make these style masks mandatory? As they would work far better than a paper mask. Or would that be too much? I only wear it for work purposes, the paper maskers would look at me funny...</p>

        <p>Would you rather pay 1 dollar (or however much they cost in dollars) for ordinary surgical mask or 10 dollars for that specialized one. You can wear that one if you want, but I guess they can't force you to wear those if they're expensive.</p>

        <p>It is not inevitable. All the propaganda shoving people toward vaxxing shows that there's a lot of resistance or they wouldn't be spending all the money on the propaganda. That means there are a lot of humans out in the world who do not want to be segregated. There will be a lot of pushback against those things, and I think ultimately they will fail.</p>

        <p>Our province just banned dine ins at restaurants and even malls but people can still eat outside on the patios. This is just depressing. i go to the mall and see all the tables are empty when theres usually lots of people even when socially distanced. I cant believe this is happening. Seems like a dream. And i cant believe people are buying into the experimental gene therapy vaccines. The long term damages are just not worth risking. I already had my health screwed up by taking accutane from a pharmaceutical company in the past and that was bad enough. Many people suicided from it or suffered long term damages even after stopping the drug. I kinda owe it to that because i learned early on that pharma companies are not to be trusted. In essence, I got red pilled the hard way. I now listen to people who are considered "conspiracy theorists" or are banned by mainstream media.</p>

        <p>There's at least 9 mods in this sub. Are you telling me all 9 of them were too busy or unsure how to fix this "mistake"? It's been 12 hours since April 1st ended. They've had plenty of time to correct this.</p>

        <p>Look- I'm not exactly overjoyed that on one of the few days I have to play on the web one of the sane subs I participate in is malfunctioning but I also need to keep in mind that how I react to it may impact my access to it down the road... and no one is entitled to participate here anyway</p>
<p>Annoying?  Absolutely... I'm human and make mistakes too.  There are indeed a sizeable team of mods- most of which likely have lives, careers, etc. and may well not realize there's a problem.  Add to that the holiday weekend (Easter; Passover) and there may be a few things on itineraries that are higher priority than being custodian to a sub that attracts a lot of very negative crap.</p>
<p>I can't imagine that it's a particularly pleasant job maintaining a platform on a site whose editorial stance opposes it so I'm not going to compound their challenges by being a problem myself.</p>

        <p>It's interesting you continue to defend them while also being the one repeatedly <strong>begging</strong> them to reinstate the flairs.</p>
<p>Were you not the one who made comments like:</p>
<p>&rt; My new slogan here: "Repair the Flair"... works well on a tee shirt or bumper sticker...</p>
<p>&rt; It's in the shop for repairs...</p>
<p>You seem to care more about repairing the flairs than the mods seem to, to be completely honest. They could, at the very least, make an announcement about it or comment on it here. I am not seeing anything from them. </p>
<p>Yes, people make mistakes. But the way they handle their mistakes is also very telling.</p>

        <p>So I just found out that my state (CT) has extended the emergency orders AGAIN! I've lost track of how many times they just took it upon themselves to do so at this point. There is no talk about it, there is no backlash. No comments on it anywhere besides if you really dig deep an angry Twitter reaction to a main tweet. Never mind voices against it, where are the peoples voices at all? It's probably cause this state is turning into a giant ghost town by the month at this point as it continually gets hammered into the ground by this shit more and more with every corrupt emergency extension.</p>

        <p>This is coming from a 17 year old who got covid, you don't want to get it, trust me. I got it 3 months back and I still struggle to breathe sometimes, and I'm healthy. The mask isn't meant to protect you, it's to keep you from spreading it, you can have it and not show any symptoms. The mask basically just slows down the air so it doesn't go as far.</p>

        <p>Here's some facts, kiddo:</p>
<p>I had it and I was fine and I have a lung disease. I had swine flu too, it was really horrific.</p>
<p>Masks don't work, until they magically suddenly do as of summer 2020. Read up on the WHO and CDC's pre March 2020 pandemic plans, we went insane because China did.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic spread doesn't exist. Masks are used to just blame the Other, because you can't really control a virus. A virus is gonna virus and it will never go away.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying masks are 100% effective, because nothing is ever completely effective, but combined with social distancing your chances of catching are significantly lower than if you didn't wear mask. And the main reason this virus is such a big deal is the fact that it affects everyone differently, it's the unpredictability of it that scares people, combined with the fact that we don't know very much about it's long term effects. If not wearing a mask just affected you I'd say it should be up to the person, but when you don't wear a mask in public you're putting others in danger, that's why it's such a big deal. I don't know what makes people think that they know better than doctors who have dealt with this kind of stuff for their whole lives, but it needs to stop, ffs just wear a mask it's not that hard.</p>

        <p>If you are under 70 you're golden. It's rare that anyone under that age group gets severely ill.</p>
<p>Masks are difficult. They impede breathing (I've passed out from them, I have a lung disease and apparently to people this is not a legitimate exception so they'd rather I die lulz), remove a lot of social and facial cues, and can be problematic for people with past trauma or disabilities. Masks also are worthless, scientifically. They do not protect you or me or anyone else: it is theatre. There is a reason they were never recommended before: because they do nothing. It just looks good, like government is 'doing something' and it's Everyone Else's Fault.</p>
<p>I don't trust the bureaucrats who threw out our previous pandemic plans to copy an authoritarian communist government.</p>

        <p>Yeah I used to think that covid wasn't a big deal until my friend who was 18 and had no health issues other than chronic back pain got it and ended up in a coma and eventually died, this virus is very unpredictable and extremely infectious, that's what makes it such a big deal, it spreads fast and it affects everyone differently. I have seen what covid can do and it's not something to take lightly, and yes masks make it slightly more difficult to breathe, but that's going to happen when you have a piece of cloth covering your face. I just want things to go back to normal, I want to be able to have a graduation ceremony like a normal highschool student but that's not going to happen, the world is changing and people just need to accept it at this point.</p>

        <p>You are okay with missing out on every important life event for what, an endemic cold virus? You won't ever have a high school or college graduation or a wedding or whatever it is. It is evil to do this to your generation, to any generation, to force you missing out on life because of a virus. I can tell you the 13 people I know who took their own lives. Or people I know who died of flu, healthy teenagers and so on, but those don't scare you because flu. (And trust me flu kills.)</p>
<p>No, it does not 'affect everyone differently'. It's a virus. It is infectious as all viruses are. Some people get unlucky but most do just fine. In fact, 99.8% of people do just fine getting it.</p>
<p>Apparently you accept living like this permanently. Some of us don't.</p>

        <p>I'm willing to give all that up if it will keep help people stay safe. And other countries have proven that we can beat covid, New Zealand is a good example of this. If they can do it we can, it's not going to be easy, and it will take a while, but it will happen. I'm not someone who trusts the government very much, but why would they destroy the economy with this lockdown if it didn't help, it just hurts them more than anyone. I'm not saying that you should do everything that the government tells you, I'm just saying that if you're not gonna wear a mask don't go out in public, if you want to go out wear a mask it's that simple, sure it might not work but it helps people feel safer. Just be a decent human being and help slow the spread of the virus, you might be fine with getting it but other people aren't. Now I gotta get to bed cuz it's midnight and I have school tomorrow. But stay safe, and have a good week.</p>

        <p>I am not sure if you truly are a high school student, or if you have had COVID-19, or your friend have had been in a coma or died. If these facts are true, then I am truly sorry. But I have become highly skeptical of people like you that say something similar and later you find out that the person is disingenuous.</p>

        <p>There is peer reviewed science about mask efficacy on pubmed. Not one conclusive study on cloth masks. Surgical masks are up to 55% effective if worn properly for up to 2 hours. And you have to put them on in a sanitized environment</p>

        <p>There are none, there's barely a consensus on what constitutes 'dying <em>from</em> covid' vs 'dying <em>with</em> covid'. </p>
<p>There wouldn't be a straightforward answer even w/o political bias - the CDC flu death estimates for previous years in the US are gigantic ranges (I think 2019 range was 50k-90k or something like that).</p>

        <p>Furthest from a doomer, but I got it day 1 I was eligible (in Chicago that was 3/29).</p>
<p>I got it for several reasons. First I am an avid traveler and music festival goer (like 50 shows a year serious). I've seen lots of hints that a vax would be a requirement for large fests (Iike Lolla) and perhaps some travel (albeit temporarily). </p>
<p>Also, as sad as it sounds, there's just a lot of social pressure to do so. Clowns are putting it on their dating profiles as some are still so afraid. My own family has some fear and want me to wear a mask holding my newborn niece (until my second shot). </p>
<p>As a very active, healthy, fairly young person... the risk of a rushed mrna vax is worse than getting COVID, I know. Unfortunately, I had to make the call that taking this chance to get my personal life back in order was worth it.</p>

        <p>Because herd immunity (95% innoculated) is the only way we know to move past the pandemic. (Had both my Pfizer Biontech jabs). Probably will need to have booster shots like the flu jab (which is shit) annually to keep on top of the variants and have enough memory T cells (antibodies) as it's still not known how long the vaccine protects for.</p>

        <p>&rt;Herd immunity is the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection. This means that even people who haven't been infected, or in whom the infection hasn't triggered an immune response, are protected because people around them who are immune can act as buffers between them and an infected person.</p>

        <p>Hello fellow rave goer! I miss raves so much. I went to an outdoor "socially distance" Desert Hearts show back in October. It was good to hear music at a proper volume again, but it just wasn't the same. The rules stated that we had to stay in our little square and keep masks on at all times. Only four people per square and no entering other squares. A group of people behind us decided to ignore the rules and merge their groups, remove their masks and venture beyond their square, encroaching on our territory. The other three people  I went with were all devoted disciples of the Church of Covid. They started talking shit about the rule breakers and felt like their health was threatened by a group of people just trying to rave freely like the before times. I just rolled my eyes, secretly wishing I had more freedom-loving friends. That kind of killed my vibe. This pandemic really exposed the dormant statists living amongst us.   </p>
<p>I'm really concerned about all this talk about vaccine passports to be able to go to festivals and concerts again. I refuse to take the vaccine and I very well may have to hang up my Spirit Hood and retire from raving. Especially if venues are still going to mandate masks indefinitely. Raving is about freedom! All this Covid propaganda has turned people all sorts of loony. I just miss the before times before we all somehow became conditioned to be afraid of people breathing in our general direction. I miss the human connection, walking through Sherwood Forest seeing all those smiling faces. I hope we can return.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and here is a news story about how <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/joe-biden-raves-ecstasy-ban-2020-election-democrats-a8967006.html">Joe Biden wanted to ban raves</a> in his home state.</p>

        <p>Hey there! I too went to socially distant rave in October, and while I did have fun, the people I went with were not my usual fam and they didn’t seem to be too into it. But I don’t blame them because there were the covid theatrics. Luckily they weren’t Branch Covdians; My main issue was the set not lasting long enough. Rolling was a not a good idea for that night. Oh and my car battery kept dying and the guy I was dating at the time killed the vibe. I told him I had AAA and he kept freaking out even though our neighbors jumped the car. :/ if I wasn’t rolling then it definitely wouldn’t have been worth it. </p>
<p>I don’t believe in the vaccine passports either and it’s a shame so many in the rave community do. I made a post about some of the comments on the electric forest subreddit I think. A guy said he can’t wait to go and wasn’t getting the vaccine. The following comments threw PLUR out the window lmao.</p>
<p>Edit: and that’s why I never could’ve voted for Biden. People fell for the propaganda so easily. I’m astonished. I don’t like this new reality.</p>

        <p>The doomers on Reddit are so quick to attack anything that undermines their narrative that Covid is literally Spanish flu come again.</p>
<p>Ive shared the following research from the CDC and WHO (the type of source these people usually cream over) that shows that Covid isn’t as deadly as the general public is being made to believe.</p>
<p>It pisses them off so much. They get so mad and defensive and rabid. It’s honestly amazing to see.</p>

        <p>You know what?  Whether or not the vaccine is safe and effective is starting to feel almost irrelevant at this point.  It is wrong to force people.  The vulnerable have nearly all had it.  There is no real need for this to be forced.  In addition to being wrong, forcing people is fucking stupid - it’s like doomers have never heard of reverse psychology.  Remember the prohibition?  I bet a lot more people would be willing to trust the vaccine if the idea of it wasn’t being shoved down their throats every day.  I mean come on, how can you deny the sheer amount of propaganda around it makes it seem dodgy?  Trying super hard to persuade someone makes it look like you’re overcompensating for a bad idea.  Basically, I think in an amusing twist of fate, doomers are largely responsible for a lot of covid vaccines not taken.  People will always fight for their freedom, and distrust ideas that are forced on them.  And so they should.</p>

        <p>My vent is that very little research is going on to describe the persons who died from COVID-19. My theory (based on certain experience) is that these people were not only overweight, elderly, or both, but that they were also isolated from much of society, either by choice or by happenstance and society’s social preferences. They did not have someone in their life to tell them they were breathing funny or to gage their symptoms within what they perceived was within the norm. It’s no wonder people in this sub sub often comment that they know no one who has been seriously ill or died from COVID-19. Not only are these people anomalies, but they are also isolated from their friends and relatives (if they have any.) So it’s quite ironic? that when the CDC tells people who have it to “shelter in place” and stay away from people, they might be isolating the isolated even more. In these persons’ cases, symptoms go unchecked until they are in need of the hospital ventilator.</p>

        <p>Hey, my parents are forcing me to take the vaccine once its available. I am not sure that it is dangerous, but I am still uncomfortable with taking it since it was approved via emergency authorization, the companies manufacturing them are granted absolute legal immunity, and the producers of the vaccines have had a corrupt history of dangerous products and fraud. (J&amp;J responsible for the opioid crisis because it bribed the FDA into lying to the public about the drugs, Bill Gates' previous medical treatments and vaccines have been investigated and long term effects have been shown to be overwhelmingly negative. These are the medicinal products usually relating to the polio vaccine and treatments of Gates that were given out to many in Africa by his philanthropy organization.) How can I convince my parents that I don't feel like taking it without sounding conspiratorial? (because I am not, although I do enjoy myself conspiracy theories)</p>

        <p>I would just ask her if she feels confident that she has investigated this medical intervention/ experimental gene therapy from all angles. Has she looked at the VAERS database of deaths and effects. Is she sure she wants the operating system implanted in her DNA that is irreversible.</p>

<p>A month or so ago, they started requiring flares such that if you posted without one, they would auto hide your topic.</p>
<p>I use I.reddit.com as my layout, and it cannot post flairs. I used to have to go back in to the full version and edit my post to add flares.</p>

        <p>Basically the approved mainstream narrative is based on the premise of Covid being the flashpoint of societal calamity- without government help.  That alone discredits it as news but certainly qualifies it as propaganda.</p>

<p>Again, you've been the one whining on here the most about the flairs being broken, but also defending the mods and acting like they did nothing wrong at all. </p>
<p>Having the sub in this state is actually a very bad thing. This should have been fixed long ago. The recent post that hasn't been deleted yet has the first commentor say he emailed them about it a while ago. So where's their response? Why not post updates here?</p>

        <p>Car dealership salespersons, do you flip the mask on for someone who is wearing the mask and flip it off for the person who isn't? Making a $20,000 SUV sale would make you want to mirror the potential buyer's tastes and sympathies. Am I right?</p>

        <p>I was just at the ATM and the usual ad popped up, which I noticed out of the corner of my eye. It said: "Let's Talk About Vaccines." I quickly looked away because I don't want to give that krap a fraction of a second more than I have to. Then as the ads paged by it came up again, and it _actually_ said: "Let's Talk About Houses". I am so used to being braced against the propaganda onslaught that it seemed legit to me that even the bank machine would be trying to dictate to me about my health, lol! I'm laughing but also deeply sad for our country.</p>

        <p>How hard is it to understand that I just want to be able to live a normal life without requiring a mask or vaccine? I've had people cite the "500,000 deaths," say that this will only go on for a little longer, and even threaten to fight me. This shit is only pushing me even closer to my limit. I don't want to live in fear of anything, including ostracism for expressing any desire to simply have the freedom to not comply with everything I'm told.</p>
<p>I'm considering doing a little bit of testing to see what I can get away with and where, but it may affect my ability to make it through the rest of high school, go to college and get a degree, and just fuck off so I can live my life. I feel trapped, and I'm starting to lose motivation again. All I want is to find happiness, contribute to society in a way I'm passionate about, and fulfill my calling to become an astronaut, but the current culture may end up fucking me over. </p>
<p>I'm seriously concerned for this generation, and I really hope the people around me are the vocal minority, even though it doesn't seem like it. </p>
<p>If anyone else has a similar experience, I'm willing to talk with you about it.</p>

        <p>Another lame ass anecdote from myself but it's quite comical.  </p>
<p>I go into a coffee shop daily an don't wear a mask when it's just me and the rest of the staff in there. We're friends. There's a new girl who never bothered me about it. The other day we have an extremely in depth conversation about politics and we exchanged a lot of view points that others would be offended by.   </p>
<p>The next day, one of the guys that worked there said "Man, if she didn't go after you for not having a mask on she must like you. She hates when people don't wear them in here".  </p>
<p>It just got me thinking - Out of all the viewpoints, opinions, controversial and divisive things exchanged in our conversation... Me wearing the mask is the benchmark for being a good  human being to her.</p>

I went to Afghanistan and my brothers and sisters died for your right to complain but man are yall fucking morons. Seriously, can you not handle a few restrictions for a temporary time in order to save fucking lives? Seriously more deaths from a single disease than all previous wars wasn't enough? Are you seriously trying to tell me you'd rather kill more people? Why? Are you really that fucking self centered. God it's like reading the ravings of lunatics in this stupid sub.

<p>Masks are uncomfortable and hinder normal social interaction (facial expressions are important).  There is not much evidence that they help much to reduce the spread of covid. And many of the people who impose the mask mandates adamantly refuse to give criteria for when they will end. This leads to concerns that masks will be required forever. Do you really want to have to wear a mask for the rest of your life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one here disagrees that covid is real. But, the response to it has been disproportionate and ineffective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree with you that the vaccines work. It appears that the main source of misinformation suggesting that they don't work is the people who say that you still have to follow all of the same precautions after getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>A couple of thoughts on vaccines, from someone who is anti-lockdown and anti-mask, but got the vaccine:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One of the main arguments that I see people make against getting the vaccine is the potential for harmful side effects. This seems to be similar to the arguments doomers make about how we have to prevent every case of covid since "we just don't know the long term effects", or over-emphasizing extremely rare cases of serious complications from covid in young people. Couldn't one apply the same criticisms to people who are overly cautious about the vaccine and people who are overly cautious about the virus?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more people who get the vaccine, the less scared the general public will be, both due to the actual vaccination numbers and reductions in case / hospitalization / death numbers. I think that covid restrictions have in large part been driven by public fear (which is fueled by messaging from the media and the government). The only way this is going to end is for the fear to go away. Once people are no longer afraid, they will be much more willing to think rationally. Only then will the general public be open to considering the evidence that most of the restrictions did very little to actually slow the spread of the virus, and in many cases caused serious harm to society.</p>

        <p>I agree with your first point, the second one is just wishful thinking. Surely you must understand the goalposts have been moved miles from where they originally were, the new one being 'get vaccinated to go back to normal'. </p>
<p>If you remember, we did all this to reduce the amount of hospitalizations; it worked. Then we decided to keep living in the 'new normal' because suddenly hospitalizations didn't matter, the amount of cases did. Cases went down, we still didn't go back to the 'old normal'. Why? We now decided cases didn't matter as much as the amount of people that are getting vaccinated. Last year we talked about going back to normal after at least the vulnerable people got vaccinated, after all they make up the <em>vast</em> majority of hospitalizations. At the beginning of this year we decided <em>all</em> adults need to get vaccinated, because 'long covid' and we need to bring cases down to near 0 for some reason. Now we're already talking about vaccinating children, because even if all adults are vaccinated, schools are a 'breeding ground' for Covid-19. What is the next reason to justify the new normal?</p>
<p>Mark my words, by the time summer ends and autumn starts we'll do this all over again because cases go up again and 'muh new variants'. The people are easily scared, especially the younger generation which has this weird dependency on daddy government to do everything for them. The government and the media have played this very smart as well; everything that goes wrong can now be blamed on people that don't get the vaccine/don't wear masks. It's the reason they set this insane standard of x% of people needing to get vaccinated to get back to normal. It's genius if I say so myself.</p>
<p>Also, getting vaccinated still means nothing. You still have to wear a mask and still have to socially distance. What's the point?</p>

<p>I agree with this point in part, but I have some hope that things will get better. In the US right now, cases are rising in several states but the governors (even the most pro-lockdown ones like Whitmer) are not imposing new restrictions. The public support for restrictions seems to have faded quite a bit since the fall, in part due to the vaccine and in part due to just being sick of this.</p>

        <p>Neither of those points addresses our main concern about the vaccine - the fact that it is mandatory! We would not be as concerned about potential side effects if we weren't forced into taking it. I think it's true that the majority of people here are happy that the vaccine exists and would have no complaints about it if it were totally voluntary. We are making such a big fuss about it because we are not being given a choice.</p>

        <p>This. The vaccine doesn't scare me, it's the fact that it's pretty much mandatory to get one that scares me. I swear if we treated the Covid-19 vaccine the same as the flu vaccine I'd happily get one. Now I feel like I'm getting forced to get one to just live my life semi-normally. For some reason you still need a mask even after getting a shot.</p>
<p>Also, the companies that make the vaccines, and have billion dollar lawsuits for a variety of reasons, have 0 liability if something happens to you after you get the shot. Seems weird to me.</p>

        <p>I agree that it should not be mandatory (for anything). At this point, though, it is not mandatory for anything as far as I know. Some people are talking about making it mandatory for some stuff, but it is not clear if they will succeed.</p>

        <p>Yes. My point though is that many people are not going to be willing to hear or participate in an open and honest discussion until they are less afraid. People are a lot better at thinking critically about things that happened in the past than about something they perceive as an ongoing threat.</p>

        <p>Tbh I think whenever the day comes that the vaccine is eligible to anyone who wants it at anytime, that will trigger the less fucks people give about COVID. I don't think it's necessarily how many people get the vaccine that will calm people down per se, it's more people having access to it.</p>

<p>Some government figureheads are thinking irrationally (e.g., it seems like Walensky is in this category), but others are just responding to public pressure. A lot of people are still wildly misinformed and very afraid about the virus, in large part due to government and media messaging. Wasn't there some study which said that about 1/3 of the population thinks the hospitalization rate is 50%? People who think they have a significant chance of dying are not going to listen to reason, they are just going to scream for the government to do something.</p>

<li>Polio actually killed young healthy people</li>
<li>Most people are getting the COVID vaccine so forcing the people who don't want to have it is unnecessary </li>
<li>Doesn't matter the cost, forcing medical procedures on unwilling people is pure evil.</li>

        <p>So because your baby didn't need to wear a mask (infants are not succeptable) so it isn't true?</p>
<p>Your buddy monitors a morgue truck and has "never" seen a body being disposed of. The morgue never disposes of any bodies. Got it, sounds like a reputable source. </p>
<p>Fucking think dude. This is a global pandemic, meaning affecting everyone around the world. If this was a US conspiracy how is everyone in the world going along with it? What the fuck is the point. Please try to think before you speak, you sound like the stupidest person I have encountered all week and I don't think that is true.</p>

<p>Millions of people have died as a result of this pandemic. This is a global pandemic, it is going on around the world and I know people around the world who can confirm that.

        <p>These are the same people who will brag about a vaccine passport. It blows my mind how people are still going along with this. If people would have stopped complying after the "2 weeks to flatten the curve", all this shit would've ended then. But, the sheep led all of us to the slaughter house and now none of this will ever end. I have nothing but absolute contempt for these people, and they deserve every ounce that's coming for them. Still not taking the vaccine, still not wearing the mask. It's only the new normal for those willing to follow the rules. I'm not.</p>

        <p>Haha.  It's interesting that doing "nothing" is what you assume I would want to do.  It really seems like the core of this all is doing "nothing" which is what the narrative was with Trump because he tried to famously tried to dismiss it etc. at first.</p>
<p>To me it seems like the crux of the issue is that politicians had to do the opposite of "nothing" in very public and extreme ways to provide the contrast of a politician "who cares about you" as opposed to somebody who will lie to you to protect the stock market.</p>
<p>So, no.  I wouldn't do nothing but I would definitely start by being more honest about it as opposed to the fearmongering and scapegoating that was a result of it becoming a political issue.</p>
<p>Restricting travel initially made sense but I don't believe in the general shutdown of so many businesses like what was done so arbitrarily.   I think public health should be there to provide aid and guidance to people, not be the arbiters of what is acceptable in our day to day life, including where we go and what we wear.</p>

        <p>But they arnt really controlling “what we wear”, masks arnt for fashion. They are to control the spread and i think even if they work 1% of the time (even though they are much much better than that) its worth it, its a piece of fuckin fabric on your face. I think the one politicizing masks are the ones not wearing them.</p>

        <p>You say "just a piece of fabric on our face" as if you really expect me to believe that our faces including our airways are just some insignificant part of our bodies like wearing a wristband to get into a club or something.
I really shouldn't have to explain the significance of our faces and mouths in terms of identity and communication with others in society.  It's obvious to everyone that there is something lost when you can't see the subtle non-verbal cues such as a smile or frown.</p>
<p>I understand how effective the mask messaging has been though so I realize I am wasting my time.  I'm just curious how long you are or would be willing to do something like masking.  We are one year and in people are into it more than ever so how long would it be for you personally to decide to start breathing fresh air again?</p>

        <p>Safe from what? A new strain of cold virus? Why does everyone still play along with this stupid charade? And why does the media and their anointed quacks keep fearmongering and blatantly feeding the public misinformation while calling it "science". It's truly the most absurd thing about all of this. I could understand the concern, panic, and worldwide reaction if this was truly a horrible plague...but it is so far from anything like that, that entire global fiasco can only be described as the biggest mass psychosis in history.</p>

        <p>I personal know people who have passed away due to covid. Saying its a new “strain of the cold” is very disrespectful and also just false. Why cant you look at the statistics and realize this. Look at the average global deaths per year and look at 2020s increase. It matches perfectly to the data we have on covid related deaths.</p>

        <p>&rt;Saying its a new “strain of the cold” is very disrespectful and also just false</p>
<p>It's neither disrespectful nor false, because that's exactly what it is. </p>
<p>If you knew something about how respiratory viruses work...you would know that this is how every cold virus starts. A virus like this doesn't mutate into something more dangerous, it eventually becomes a common cold...just like the six other coronavirus colds.</p>
<p>Covid is a 0.2% IFR (infection fatality ratio) respiratory virus, a new strain of coronaviridae which has an average mortality age over 80...this is literally how every common cold virus originated. </p>
<p>I know the media keeps acting like this is a magical alien supervirus that has it's own rules and no one knows anything about (even after one year)...but it's simply a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus...hardly anything enigmatic.</p>
<p>&rt;It matches perfectly to the data we have on covid related deaths.</p>
<p>You realize lockdowns crashed economies that caused severe increases in deaths from starvation, overdoses, suicides, etc.? If you think excess deaths equal covid than no offense, but you have no idea what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>“During mid-April the “counted deaths” for COVID-19 in the United States were around 15,000 per week. During a typical “peak week” for the flu, the “counted deaths” are about 750.”</p>

<p>Keep your blinders on, ill just leave it at this. Your anecdotal experiences dont beat countless studies on this. Again, 2020 saw 2.85 million deaths from covid, the flu saw 60,000 deaths.</p>

        <p>I think i got a few comments all mixed up in my head, so my response wasnt very accurate to your comment. </p>
<p>That being said, even with a .27% IFR covid has killed millions of people while the flu and flu-like illnesses killed 60,000 total. I understand that the rate is low, but due to its very infectious nature, people should still abide by safety rules, and anyone who disregards them is putting others at risk and, in my opinion, are being selfish.</p>

        <p>Only reason why the world is taking this long to got back to normal is because of people like you. Had everyone just chilled in their house for 3  weeks we would not be here with 2.84m dead but no, youre time and life  is worth so much more than others. Funny thing is I'll be banned as a  troll and you won't even see the irony of what you're doing.

        <p>Do people seriously still believe the "if we all just stayed inside for 3 weeks" nonsense? There is 0 chance that this would have ever worked in the US (or in Europe, for similar reasons). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can't just make everyone stay inside for 3 weeks. People need food, electricity, medical care, etc. Someone has to work to provide this. </p>

<li>
<p>It is not possible to get 100% compliance with anything. Any plan which requires 100% compliance is a fantasy, not a plan. </p>

<p>By the time people started to be concerned about covid in the US, the virus was already very widespread. We were well past the point of eliminating it.</p>

<p>Tons of people come in and out of the US every day, whether the US government wants them to or not. Even if by some miracle we had managed to eliminate covid, it would have come back in from somewhere else.</p>

<p>China is the one that perpetuated lockdowns to take advantage of a situation where, frankly, none of this would have happened had we shrugged and moved on with our lives following the pre-March 2020 CDC and WHO pandemic plans.</p>
<p>I'd say you are selfish and ignorant if you think lockdowns work and cheer on the destruction of society and advance of totalitarian, fascist regimes the world over.</p>

        <p>You guys always like to compare Covid-19 to the common flu, well because of your so called „useless lockdowns“ the common flue waves have been a lot lower than usual. Has maybe something to do with the fact that actual experts in medicine, virology and pandemics expressed their urgent concern to all governments to enact these things. Why are you all sooooo resistant to actual facts, so many times I read here that all doctors are lying, the government is lying or person X is lying.. I know this comment will do absolutely nothing for you guys. You are too far into the conspiracy theory bubble so enjoy life one day someone you love will probably have serious health related problems from Covid-19 the very dangerous virus that really exists.</p>

        <p>Nah, nobody will. Governments did this for power and control out of mass hysteria - I suggest you read Michael P. Senger's excellent articles about the CCP influence of lockdowns to fuck the West. Or are you a CCP bot?</p>
<p>It does exist. Is it dangerous? To a portion of the population, as is flu which kills lots of children but we don't destroy society for that.</p>
<p>Experts? No, public health bureaucrats, never elected, coming up with shoddy bullshit models whilst plenty of actual experts are ignored because they are not on the Narrative and look at real pandemic plans pre March 2020, which never included things like destroying society and the economy with lockdown, but instead encouraged living our lives as much as possible - keeping things normal. No, they keep saying no, lockdown forever, do this forever, forever, nothing is good enough, not a  vaccine, nothing, do this PERMANENTLY, and you all just roll over and accept it hook, line, and sinker.</p>

        <p>First of all, no governments did not do this for power and control. How would they even get control through masks? Or lockdowns? They do this to ensure a minimum of people die. Yes old people have the highest chance of dying to it. Last I checked that portion of the population was not small nor worth to let them die? Once again China does a lot to get more world control and power, using a pandemic and lockdowns? Most unefficient way I have ever heard about. If you actually wanna know how governments enact measures to stay in power/get more control go read some history books. I would as a person living in germany of course recommend anything that goes deeper into how the NSDAP came to power.</p>
<p>Okay idk why you think the flue has disappeared, I said the flu has not infected nor have people died as much during the lockdowns, pandemic measures in general. One of the biggest reason WHY the flu for example kills is their ability to adapt, this is why for example a flu shot is rather useless. Lockdowns are not destroying lifes, Covid-19 does. The measures to try to end Covid-19 are there so that we all can hopefully get back to a more normal life somewhat soon. Oh and if you think Covid isnt affecting me my dad has been without work for over a year (food serving industry) and I also cant find a job since half a year. </p>
<p>Theres the problem, you look at so called „real“ pandemic plans, could you tell me how those plans looked? In germany our government vastly underestimated how difficult this virus would be and as a result of that „plan“ back before march last year we now face a shitload of issues. Also a vaccine wasnt even close to being available back in march. </p>
<p>Of course covid is something we will have to live with our whole lifes, it wont be filled with lockdowns and such forever lol</p>

        <p>I just want to say, respectfully, fuck you. You have taken the simple act of wearing a mask, a courtesy that any citizen could easily and effortlessly extend to others, and made it into something political. Literally the least you could do is too much for you. The lockdowns and forced closures by government are the direct result of not being able to trust people to extend the smallest bit of thought for others during a global pandemic. You selfishness is the reason the government needs to intervene. Fuck you for not doing the bare minimum for your fellow humans. Fuck you for extending the length of this pandemic and the suffering of others. And fuck you for endangering the vulnerable members of society with your hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>I'm going to be honest after about the half a million dead Mark in the United States. I quit caring about the feelings of those who unfortunately were not born with the brain capacity nor the mental fortitude to understand what the hell we are going through right now. I suggest long-term public shaming for everyone that has been going on about this anit vaccine anti mask bullshit. I also believe that intervention by Child Protection Services for refusing to vaccinate your children is absolutely within the governments mandate</p>

        <p>Nope it's a vaccine and my whole family have had it already. No one died or even got sick from it. I would really like to know after a billion administered doses how many people died. Can you express that as a percentage? Is it less than 1% ? Is it like.0.00001%.</p>

<p>The same reason we never wore them during every flu season we've had. It barely works, even if it did it only works assuming you handle your mask correctly which means you need to wash your cloth masks every day and throw away dispensable masks every few hours. If you don't do that, it actually does more harm than good. Guess what, 99% of the people don't do this. Oh, and I have not forgotten the fact that the very same guys saying masks work, said last year that masks didn't work at all and we shouldn't wear them. In fact, I remember pro-mask posts on twitter and facebook being deleted for 'misleading information'. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from a very fringe minority nobody says Covid-19 doesn't exist. You only mention this to make us look stupid and dismiss any argument we may have about the handling of this pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this some new way to dismiss people who are skeptical of the new vaccines with new technology being forced on us while the companies that made them are not liable in any way? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am <em>not</em> responsible for your health and you will <em>not</em> force me to undergo a medical procedure against my will. You're free to triple mask, socially distance 10ft away and inject yourself with as many vaccines as you want. Just don't force that stuff on me.</p>

<p>Flu season was virtually non existent this year, likely because of masking.  </p>
<p>https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20210225/what-happened-to-flu-season</p>
<p>My family was at work and school this year and it’s the first year nobody got sick, not even a cold.  Go to work, get a new surgical mask and go home and throw it out was the procedure here.  Covid doesn’t remain viable on surfaces for very long so your schtick about continuously washing masks is silly.  It’s the same reason takeout food never became a vector.</p>
<p>&rt;    I am not responsible for your health and you will not force me to undergo a medical procedure against my will.</p>
<p>You’re 100% right here.  You have the freedom to do what you chose with your body and absolutely nobody has the right to force you to do anything.</p>
<p>Please remember I also have the freedom to refuse your access to my business and my home if you refuse to take precautions to protect everyone else sharing that space with you.  That’s also my right.</p>
<p>Freedom works both ways.  You’re free to be an idiot and I’m free to tell you to fuck off and don’t put my customers at risk.  If you don’t want to vaccinate you can wear a mask until we reduce community spread.</p>
<p>What you want is for everyone to let you do whatever you want and that’s not the way it works, sorry bub.</p>

        <p>&rt;Flu season was virtually non existent this year, likely because of masking.</p>
<p>There were a myriad of measures used to combat Covid-19, masking was just one of them. To say that masking has stopped the flu is oversimplifying it. I'd say that closing almost everything (amusement parks, clubs, bars etc.) has done a lot more to stop the flu from spreading than a simple mask, but that's just me. </p>
<p>We're also at risk of getting a way harsher flu season next winter because it's now a <em>lot</em> harder to make effective vaccines for the next flu season. </p>
<p>&rt;Covid doesn’t remain viable on surfaces for very long so your schtick about continuously washing masks is silly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wash-cloth-face-coverings.html#:~:text=Wash%20your%20cloth%20mask%20whenever,away%20after%20wearing%20it%20once.">Even the CDC says you have to wash your cloth mask at least daily and discard disposable face masks after wearing it once.</a> Also, I wasn't specifically talking about Covid-19 sticking to the surface. Cloth masks that do not get cleaned regularly are a breeding grounds for bacteria. Before Covid-19 people would probably do this, but I know for a fact that now people just keep a cloth/disposable mask in their pocket to enter the stores that require them. They don't get cleaned or thrown away at all.</p>
<p>&rt;Please remember I also have the freedom to refuse your access to my business and my home if you refuse to take precautions to protect everyone else sharing that space with you. </p>
<p>The media has really got to you haven't they? You act like I'm a biological hazard capable of killing everyone around me.</p>
<p>&rt;Freedom works both ways. You’re free to be an idiot and I’m free to tell you to fuck off and don’t put my customers at risk. If you don’t want to vaccinate you can wear a mask until we reduce community spread.</p>
<p>Because I don't feel responsible for the health of other people I'm an idiot? I sure hope the clothes you wear and the electronics you use aren't from countries like China, because I've got something to tell you about the massive amounts of (child) suicides you contributed to. Anyways, this is all fine by me. Just as long as the government doesn't mandate shit. Let businesses <em>and</em> people decide for themselves what they want. </p>
<p>&rt;What you want is for everyone to let you do whatever you want and that’s not the way it works, sorry bub.</p>
<p>I am not going to be forced to do stuff against my will, I still don't get what's so hard to understand here. I couldn't care less about masks tbh, as long as they are temporary. An almost forced vaccine is where I draw the line.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/25/covid-pandemic-flu-shot-478065">Here</a>. It's pretty logical, people will have reduced immunity and thus are more susceptible to the flu virus because of the missed flu season last winter. </p>

I trust my doctor, my wife’s dr and my kids doctors who surprisingly all say the same thing...don’t lock yourselves inside but take basic precautions.</p>
<p>I'm sad to hear that. In my case plenty of people I know have gotten Covid-19 and it did nothing. Quarantining for two weeks was worse than the virus itself. The statistics support what I see, for our age group we have like a 99.99% chance of survival. It's not like I'm going into nursing homes and coughing on people (and that would still do nothing if I don't have Covid-19), but I am not going to throw years of my life away with everything closed and all kinds of restrictions that take the fun out of everything. If that makes me an asshole, so be it. </p>
<p>You can take all the precautions you want, more power to you. Just, once again, don't force me to do those things. </p>

<p>Well if all you hear, every single day for the past year, is how many cases there are and how many people died I understand why most people are this scared. That's why I say people are brainwashed because nobody is making rational decisions anymore. </p>
<p>What I'm personally more scared of is the massive amounts of government overreach while the majority of people not only let this happen, they're practically begging for their government to go further.</p>

        <p>flu season was "non existent" because people were told not to leave their houses and made afraid, and in a lot of places, deaths that were of someone "suspected to have COVID" were labelled as COVID. a lot of flu symptoms overlap with those of COVID. </p>
<p>also all anyone ever talks about now is COVID. you're not gonna hear about anything else anywhere. </p>
<p>the fact that actual adults who are supposed to have at least a little bit of critical thinking skills think the flu just "disappeared" actually baffles me.</p>

        <p>Actually there’s at least one study that shows that out of 3 groups (no mask, medical mask, cloth mask) the cloth mask group had the highest infection rate.  Want the link?</p>

        <p>I would be interested in reading this as I am wondering if it is the same as one I previously read which was essentially:</p>
<p>Cloth masks are almost completely useless and become even more useless every time they are washed.</p>
<p>The standard medical masks most people wear are worse than no masks unless you frequently wash your hands and replace the mask multiple times a day as you will need to replace it virtually every time you adjust it in order to breathe. By bringing your hands to your nose and mouth more often, you increase the risk of infection.</p>
<p>The only masks that are any good at preventing the spread of the disease are N95 masks without filters, but these need to be reserved for frontline staff and should not be used by the general public.</p>

<p>We don't want the "new normal". That's the whole point of this place. We aren't willing to let COVID ruin what little time we have on this Earth. Simple as.</p>
