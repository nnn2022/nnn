        <p>Agreed completely, but I’ll play along for a minute. (Addressed to OP clearly, not you you)</p>
<p>I had covid. I was fine. Very mild, probably wouldn’t have known it if I didn’t have the test. I’ve had colds that were worse (I do now actually lol)</p>
<p>I can’t see the rest of the questions as I’m typing so I’ll just give a rundown. I have PTSD and asthma and cannot wear a mask without severe panic attacks and breathing issues. I don’t give a flying fuck if “the holes allow air in and out”, when you’re panicking while reliving a past trauma and asthmatic on top of it, it doesn’t matter how much air you’re getting, you’re going to have a bad time even without a mask on. I also have issues breathing in warm air, it sets my asthma off so while sure, masks allow air in and out, the air in the mask you’ve just exhaled and are now mostly reinhaling is hot and very aggravating to those with breathing issues. </p>
<p>I don’t wear a mask everywhere I “can”. I found a gym that basically said fuck you to our government and won’t require them, and many stores offer medical exemptions (as they should based on the mandates). When I go somewhere that requires one, I wear a thin piece of chiffon cut into a triangle-it’s completely mesh and full of little holes but it’s light enough that I can wear it for a few minutes without panicking, and you can’t tell it’s sheer unless you’re up close because of the color and texture.</p>
<p>As far as the “pathogens rarely get through the mask” lmao, I can’t even with that comment. I have a public health/global health crises/bio degree and I can assure you pathogens as small as covid get through the mask and get out around it no problem. That’s the thing with effective viruses like this, they do what they need to to spread, so you put a mask there and bam it’s going to go through the holes and out then edges easy. We ran through simulations in my research in school on how to solve issues with viral infections in third world countries, and “have them wear masks!” was shot down immediately because they do almost nothing for respiratory viruses like this. I have no idea where you’re getting your “very rarely” from, but if you can pull one scientifically sound study showing this I’d be impressed. the “studies” I’ve seen have shoddy methods that would never be accepted if the subject were anything else. In fact there was a study out of Oxford or Cambridge (can’t remember which now) that went through the studies coming out on masks and it found that they didn’t follow the scientific method in order to get a desired result. But there are true scientific studies from prior years before this narrative that studied masks and the flu and found that anything short of a fitted N95 did nothing at all. But suddenly we’re forgetting those and you’re focusing on these crappy ones coming out in the midst of this. They are not trustworthy by any means. </p>
<p>What it comes down to for me is that it’s a choice. It should not be mandated. If people not wearing masks scares you so much, you stay home. And if pathogens “rarely” get through the masks as you say, then they aren’t getting into them either and your mask will protect you from everyone not wearing one.</p>

        <p>i don’t wear a mask in public. why? because i keep hearing all these doomer talking shit about how they’re going to murder people that don’t wear masks, and i’ve been waiting to let my anger out on someone for the past 7 months. </p>
<p>not to mention that i wouldn’t mind dying if i actually lose the fight since this lockdown has already ruined 95% of my entire fucking social life.</p>

        <p>&rt;do you or do you know somebody with COVID-19?</p>
<p>I have known several here in NY, including my 95-year-old grandmother.  Symptoms ranged from nothing to bad flu.  Only one who ended up in the hospital is overweight and diabetic.  Thank god they didn't put him on a murderator.  The ones who got most sick seemed to contract the virus early, suggesting that it has possibly mutated into a stain with less intense symptoms.</p>
<p>&rt;are you a doctor? (Official training, please include photo evidence.)</p>
<p>No, but I know there are plenty of medical professionals on this sub.</p>
<p>&rt; do you wear a mask in public, and just show your hate on this sub, or do you not wear a mask in public. (Bonus fuckyou if you have COVID symptoms)</p>
<p>I wear it in the store, in the hall at work, when getting takeout, riding the train, etc.  I don't enjoy it but it's easier than picking a fight everywhere I go. I have seasonal allergies and if I'm having a particularly sneezy day I'll be more diligent about masking around others, out of courtesy, not because I think it's actually doing anything.  I will not wear one outdoors.   Even Fauci said outdoor transmission is virtually nonexistent.  Fresh air is important.  I will not wear one in my own home, in my own private office, or in my own car.  If you don't like it you can leave my space.  </p>
<p>&rt;why do you consider active safety measures (that protect others from you and you from others) </p>
<p>Strapping a dirty rag to your face is not an "active safety measure" and it doesn't protect anyone from anything</p>
<p>&rt; to be a new normal </p>
<p>Because government officials have been literally calling it that since April?  Because pro-maskers are now advocating mask-wearing during flu seasons/cold seasons even post-COVID?  Because we are inundated with posters, signs, and other propaganda everywhere we go hammering this "new normal" into our heads?</p>
<p>&rt;despite the fact that if everybody wore a mask covid would be gone in about a year </p>
<p>Where is your evidence of this?  Even if mask-wearing helped slow the spread (I have my doubts that it does), <em>slowing</em> the spread means that it will take a longer period of time for COVID to run its course and die out from herd immunity.  Wearing a mask isn't going to make the disease magically disappear in a year.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe in conspiracies about masks</p>
<p>I do believe more with each passing day there is a greater agenda behind requiring people to hide their faces</p>
<p>&rt;i.e: masks are microchipped</p>
<p>Don't conflate us with those lunatics</p>
<p>&rt;or covid is a hoax</p>
<p>Nobody thinks that.  It's possible to acknowledge that the virus exists while simultaneously acknowledging that government/society/news media's reaction has been far more extreme than necessary.</p>
<p>&rt; are you aware that facemasks are special cloths that have holes big enough for air and ( very rarely ) get pathogens to come in and out?</p>
<p>I don't even understand this sentence.  They get pathogens to come in and out?  So you're admitting that they're useless against disease spread?</p>
<p>&rt;do you think wearing a mask is “rebreathing” the carbon dioxide you just exhaled, when in fact its ~80% the heat from the exhale instead?</p>
<p>Again, if the mask keeps pathogens from being released into the air, then doesn't that imply that they are caught in the mask and festering right in front of my mouth?  And if it doesn't keep pathogens from being released into the air, then why are we wearing them?</p>
<p>&rt;are you; immune compromised (AIDS/certain conditions) Asthmatic? suffering from a organ problem?</p>
<p>Mostly healthy.  Not obese but a bit on the overweight side thanks to a sweet tooth and a heated long-term affair with booze.  Any adverse effects that my weight and drinking may have on my greater health/immune system are 100% my own fault any my own responsibility. If I had a condition like asthma I would probably voluntarily stay isolated.  I wouldn't expect the entire rest of the world to pander to my special needs.</p>

<li>
<p>No. In fact if it wasn't for the news constantly telling me there was a pandemic I would have never guessed there was one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a medical doctor, but I have a STEM PhD so I am trained to do research and study scientific literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wear it in public only when mandatory and only then because I'd rather not have a psychopathic mask zealot violently attack me if I don't, or have a brainless policeman stomp on my head because they have been given carte blanche to do so by their psychopathic mask zealot superior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not going to be temporary because masks are just as effective (or rather, ineffective) at stopping influenza and other viruses that can cause illness/death. Every single argument pro-maskers have for wearing them to prevent the spread of covid applies to stopping the spread of influenza etc. If you don't think masks should continue to be be worn to stop influenza - which has been with us forever - then you're a hypocrite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, although I have seen no evidence that pathogens "very rarely" get out (got a source for this opinion?), and I am also aware of <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">a recent article published by the CDC</a> where a review of 14 RCTs including over 6,000 participants found that face masks have no significant impact at reducing the spread of influenza. And before you say it (because pro-maskers always do) the spread of influenza absolutely is comparable to the spread of covid. <em>A lot</em> of covid research - both for and against masks - makes this comparison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't know, but the <a href="https://docs4opendebate.be/en/open-letter/">Belgian health services</a> think so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>

        <p>I know one person who had covid but with the accuracy of the PCR tests could've easily been the flu</p>
<p>And the so called safety measures don't make sense </p>
<p>Theirs no or little evidence that masks work, just have a look at all the states that mandated masks the cases increased how tf does that happen 
And the size of covid 19 is too small to be blocked by by a peice of cloth so if you claim that's wrong then why haven't mask mandates worked in any state 
https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app</p>
<p>Some cases a cloth masks INCREASES risk cause you touch your face more and the mask being too moist</p>
<p>And we call it the new normal bullshit, cause so much division is happening from these measures everyone is scarred of eachother, looks like robots with no facial expressions with the masks dispite everyone telling us in march masks were useless</p>
<p>And lockdowns are even worse, their killing people and destroying economies, lives, supply chains, destroying relationships and killing mental health and ironically vitamin D and healthy diet and excrcise are the best ways to defeat covid so why are we limiting that with covid?</p>

<li>I  know of about 30 people who've gotten it. One of whom is a very close friend of mine, for all of them it was just like the regular flu or not as bad. Another close friend of mines 70-year-old morbidly obese father got it and also survived, said it was like a bad flu</li>
<li>no</li>
<li>I do when I'm forced too, outside of that no</li>
<li>you don't know it'd be gone in a year. it probably won't be because CNN seems to dictate whether it's gone or not</li>

<li>yes</li>
<li>no, that is pretty damn stupid</li>
<li>I have type 1 diabetes, chronically low WBC, and probably some undiagnosed autoimmune diseases  (it runs in the family)</li>

<p>I still stand by that if someone offered me a CC of corona virus and were willing to pay for a hotel room that I'd inject it straight into my veins. If you're for a coronavirus shutdown you're either stupid, or a coward manchild</p>

<p>I’ve known several people who have had varying degrees of the illness. One ranging from body aches and nothing else to blood clots in the lungs (several underlying health issues here)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a doctor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not wear a mask in public and do not patronize businesses requiring a mask. It’s their sore and their rules so I respect that. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new normal is a term that on its face means we are not going back. It is the new normal. Face masks for a year is control of governments looking to test the limits of their control over people. Will they comply with this order?  What if we take it a step further?  And another step?  And another?  Conditioning is a huge part of mask wearing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t believe in these conspiracies. </p>

<p>6 and 7.  I am of the belief that masks are not the cure all for stopping the spread of disease. There many studies that show their limited efficacy, here is one. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7</p>
<ol>
<li>I am none of the above. I am however highly claustrophobic.</li>

<p>No. I know <em>of</em> some people, all of whom either had no symptoms or had mild flu-like symptoms and were fine in about a week at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At work and nowhere else. I'm only going to play their stupid safety theater game if I get paid to, and no more than absolutely necessary to get my paycheck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By and large they DON'T work, and I don't need protected from a bad cold, nor do most people. The few who do can take special precautions - work from home, wear an n95 if they have to go out, and so on. Good hand-washing and staying home when sick is enough for everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No. It's been exaggerated and there's a lot of fraudulent and mistaken "case" reporting, but the virus exists and has made some people sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aerosolized droplets are tiny enough to fit through, and asymptomatic people rarely spread the disease anyway. Masks don't work to prevent community spread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, the CO2 increase is small. What isn't small is the bacteria and moisture buildup in and on the mask. You also end up touching your face and near your eyes a lot more with one than without. The CO2 difference and bad air flow is enough to hurt people's ability to exercise and work if their job is strenuous. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of those. I don't even have a Facebook or Twitter account.</p>
