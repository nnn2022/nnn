    <strong>Ideology and lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>I've heard the word 'ideologue' hurled at those who oppose lockdowns. Let's look at it from a different angle.</p>
<p>Shutting down vast swathes of the private sector for a supposed common good. Is it not obvious why this may be appealing to certain kinds of leftists? As an attempted rectifier, the role of the state in the economy and levels of government spending have greatly increased. Again, it's pretty clear that this fits in with significant strands of leftist ideology.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, many on the left have been looking for a way to break the 'free market' consensus that has prevailed throughout much of the West. They didn't quite get it after the 2008 financial crisis, but it looks as though they may have got it now. </p>
<p>To be clear, I'm no hardcore free marketer myself, but it's always useful to examine the mentalities behind policies, particularly those as widespread and fundamental as lockdowns.</p></p>

        <p>Freedom and autonomy are good ideas. </p>
<p>If you want to call me an “ideologue” for that go right ahead. </p>
<p>Turns out humans have value systems. Weird.</p>
