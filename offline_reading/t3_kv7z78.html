    <strong>I’m a nursing student that has been offered the vaccine for free</strong>
    <p><p>I will start off by saying I’m not an anti-vaxxer and I have previously received many vaccines including the flu shot each year.</p>
<p>However, I am highly skeptical of the Covid vaccine. I’m not sure if I believe in the microchipping theory, but I just don’t trust this vaccine because it was rushed out, it’s newer technology, and it has unknown long-term effects.</p>
<p>My school is offering a free Covid vaccine for each student and they claim it is “not mandatory.” EXCEPT, if you choose to not get the vaccine, you have to meet with the dean 1-on-1 to explain why, AND you won’t be able to care for Covid patients during clinicals. This means that if your group is vaccinated and you aren’t, you will not be permitted to be on the floor with them and will have to do an alternate assignment. Complete bullshit. So basically, I will have to take the vaccine or else miss out on a huge part of school that I’m paying for. </p>
<p>Not to mention it is not required for actually healthcare workers and they’re still permitted to care for Covid patients. When I graduate I’ll be able to whether I get the vaccine or not (for now). </p>
<p>My instructors got on Zoom today to tell us that they’ve taken it and they feel fine. I’m sure they do, but again the long term effects of this vaccine have not been discovered yet and there have been rumors that it might affect fertility. So my 40 year-old instructors have no issue with that, but for my classmates and I who possibly want to start families in the future, it is something to consider. And I shouldn’t have to go talk to the dean to explain that.</p></p>

        <p>It is not proven that you can't transmit the virus after you had the shots. That's why you still have to wear the mask and keep distance - their own guidance.So even the "vaccinated" are putting others at risk.</p>

        <p>I think it is completely unfair to expect people to explain their reasons why they don't want to do something. 
Weren't we taught that "no" was a sentence in itself? </p>
<p>I'm also not against vaccines either and have had all of mine, along with having my kids vaccinated. Apart from the flu jab as I find that as equally as pointless as the covid one. </p>
<p>Not only is it perfectly normal to have doubts about such a rushed vaccine. Im pretty sure it has not been FDA approved as it was rushed through under emergency use (i might be wrong on that).</p>
<p>It is perfectly reasonable for you to claim that your reasons for denying it, is to just be sensible with your own health and see how it goes over the coming months for other people. Not to mention the fact that it does not guarantee that you wouldn't still be able to transmit the virus since you can still catch it. So it really shouldn't matter if you're vaccinated or not, if the people you're around are vaccinated.</p>

        <p>You're not wrong.  It was only allowed under the EUA (Emergency Use Act).  Same with masks and lockdowns.  EUA is everything and I mean Everything right now.  If the state of Emergency was lifted, everything would go back to normal.  All Covid "laws" would all crumble to dust.   The "vaccine" is only allowed as long as we are in a state of emergency.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think it’s weird that they’re allowing students to care for COVID + patients if they get it. I’m in nursing school and I have many friends at other nursing programs and we’re all pretty much unable to care for COVID + patients because of liability. I’ve never heard of a nursing program allowing students to care for COVID+ patients with or without the vaccine. </p>
<p>My program isn’t requiring the vaccine as of now. All of my instructors have made it clear they aren’t taking it either, but then again, I live in a rural conservative area. </p>
<p>It’s been made clear time and time again that the n95 masks are sufficient in a hospital setting to prevent the spread. Some of our students are having to go to floors where almost everyone is covid + and all the school and hospital are demanding is that the students get fitted for and wear n95 masks and only enter patient rooms who aren’t covid +. Seems very strange that this program is letting students care for COVID + patients.</p>

        <p>Posted this elsewhere but it fits also in this context:</p>
<p>We were protesting against the lockdown today and this guy who was  working at a nursing home talked to us. In 2018 they had 15 dead from  the flu, this year nobody died despite many testing positive. 8 of his  collegues got vaccinated and the side effects in 6 of them were so  strong that they definitely won't take the second shot.</p>

        <p>Tell your stupid dean that this health-care worker is going to be refusing the flu vaccine from now on too.  I'm a pro at wearing the face diaper at this point and I've been told it's working wonders!</p>

        <p>Don’t do it!! Meet with the dean, whomever you need to. They are just trying to make things as difficult as possible for you so you’ll comply. Don’t give in!! It’s your future they are risking.</p>
<p>Edit to add: Lie and say it goes against your religion. I think it’s seven day adventist or maybe Jehovah’s witness that don’t allow most medical treatments. I knew a girl that had to keep her blood in storage in case of an accident because they won’t receive blood products.</p>
