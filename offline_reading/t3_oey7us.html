    <strong>A bus driver shouted at me for not wearing a mask and I just didn't give a shit.</strong>
    <p><p>So here in Germany, we just reached an incidence of 4.9 while it has been below 10 for weeks by now. Despite this, the mask mandate is still in place for whatever stupid reason.</p>
<p>A day ago I went to visit a friend of mine in a nearby city. After a few hours of my arrival we went to the bus stop to go somewhere he wanted to show me. While outside waiting and chatting, I of course didn't bother putting my mask on and once the bus arrived, I just hoped in completely forgetting to put my mask on. Suddenly a loud angry voice came through the bus speakers. It was the old grumpy bus driver telling me that there is a mask mandate.</p>
<p>I look to the front and saw she was looking at me. Best part was, she didn't have a mask on either, lol. So I just asked her where her mask is to which she replied that it is not mandatory for her to wear a mask. I told her, if it is not mandatory for her to wear a mask, then I refuse to wear mine, since she is endangering my safety (not like I believe in this bullshit anyways). After I told her that, she just said that I shouldn't complain if a ticket inspector hops on and gives me a fine for being mask-less, and then turned around and got back to driving.</p>
<p>How does it make sense that everyone in the bus has to wear a mask, but the driver doesn't, when we are going to be breathing the same air for the next 20 or 30 minutes? This whole clown show is just about control, and I am sick of being a part of it. They want to fine me? Let them try it, it is not illegal here to run away from the cops, and I sure as hell can run faster than 2 police officers who barely train once a week and are wearing their stupid masks 24/7.</p></p>
