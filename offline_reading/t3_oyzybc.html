    <strong>Three Covid Scenarios, Submitted for Your Consideration</strong>
    <p><p><em>The below are fictionalized, purely speculative narratives that could each be true, given current evidence.  As the days go on, it will become clear which is closest to reality.</em></p>
<p><em>For now, we must make do with uncertainty.</em></p>
<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<p>Sometime in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was released into the population in Wuhan, China.  It spread undetected until a number of citizens became seriously ill, causing multiple whistleblowers in the Wuhan medical community to warn of a novel pathogen.  By midwinter, Wuhan had been sealed off.  The Chinese government had begun the construction of hospitals in the area with unprecedented speed as more and more people succumbed.</p>
<p>At first, Western governments saw this as a problem that was likely to remain restricted to eastern Asia.  The World Health Organization suggested that China had the problem under control.  By February, however, it had become clear that the virus was spreading globally; in short order, Iran and Italy had experienced severe outbreaks, triggering draconian lockdown measures.  On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the erstwhile "contained" COVID-19 crisis had become a pandemic.  One by one, countries across the world imposed lockdown restrictions, some of them not to be lifted even to the time of this writing.</p>
<p>For years, scientists in the United States had been developing the technology necessary to carry messenger RNA (mRNA) from a needle into a cell without it breaking down in transit.  In theory, this process would allow a vaccine to be produced in the body itself, using the machinery of the cells to construct the proteins necessary to trigger an immune response.  This would avoid the risks associated with introducing deactivated viruses into the body and would allow more efficient and flexible vaccine production.  In 2020, by what some considered a miracle, Pfizer and Moderna each produced mRNA vaccines for COVID-19, both of which flew through clinical trials and were approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States.  Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca and a number of governments produced viral vector vaccines, using technology that was also relatively new but had seen use in the fight against Ebola.  The viral vector vaccines hit numerous hiccups in their distribution, facing lower efficacy against the virus as well as accusations from multiple governments of unacceptable side effects.</p>
<p>It is at this point that the story diverges, becoming three.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario I: The Null Hypothesis</strong></p>
<p>Due to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, companies and governments were quick to develop various vaccines.  After overcoming roadblocks and supply difficulties, these helped people around the world to protect themselves from serious disease.  Despite the urgency of the crisis, proper safety precautions were taken and no ill effects emerged as a result of the vaccines.  The success of the vaccines led to the pandemic's eventual dissipation, leaving behind an endemic, minor infection that posed no greater threat than the seasonal flu.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario II: The Best Laid Plans</strong></p>
<p>For years, public health authorities had been growing more and more prepared, some might say paranoid or even a bit guiltily excited, for the Big One.  Mad Cow, Avian Flu, Swine Flu, Zika, Ebola...all  limited, all contained.  Finally, in 2019, a new villain emerged, and it seemed that the moment had come.  Public health authorities, pharmaceutical companies and the journalistic apparatus, having been coiled like springs for years, at last leapt into action.  Lockdowns were imposed, masks were mandated, crews of hazmat-clad workers sprayed clouds of disinfectant throughout cities.  As soon as the vaccines became available, they were approved, but despite the best efforts of the approving entities to be objective, the pressure to save lives was too great.  Without any way of knowing the long term impact of these experimental gene therapies, governments unleashed the pharmaceutical giants, which churned out doses at breakneck pace.  Countries competed with one another for doses, and journalists and social media platforms scrambled to inform the public of the benefits of mRNA vaccines while working assiduously to censor and downplay information about the lingering risks.</p>
<p>As time went on, vaccines were mandated in most major cities.  There had been voices around the periphery worrying about the fact that the vaccinated could still spread the virus amongst themselves, but in the mad rush toward zero Covid, these voices were ignored.  Other peripheral voices wondered why natural immunity was being treated as irrelevant, and why the young, who were at almost zero risk of dying, were being told to get vaccinated as opposed to waiting for natural immunity.  Such voices were also ignored.  Eventually, the Phi Variant emerged in New York City, which had stalled out at a vaccination rate of around 90%.  Because almost everyone passing the virus throughout the city had been vaccinated, this variant had evolved near-complete immunity to vaccines.  This meant that it posed a greater threat to those who lacked natural immunity, which was able to target areas of the virus that were not associated with the spike protein.  The Phi Variant crippled the global economy and sent the world spiraling back into the dark days it thought were behind it.  To make matters worse, the Phi Variant seemed subject to antibody dependent enhancement in those who had been vaccinated but lacked natural immunity.  That is, the vaccine-generated antibodies were able to bind to the virus but did not incapacitate it, allowing the virus to evade detection by the immune system.  Booster doses, limited as they were to the spike protein, did little to help, and often made matters worse.  When the dust finally settled, millions were dead, and it was hard to find a single family left untouched.</p>
<p>And so it went that our savior became our peril.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario III: Conspiracy</strong></p>
<p>Climate change was widely regarded in Chinese intelligence circles as the greatest threat to the power of the Chinese Communist Party.  Since the late 1990s, the best and brightest had been put to work in search of an answer to a very important question: how could China reach Western levels of prosperity during the 21st century, a century in which it would be increasingly difficult to ignore the degradation of the planet's ability to support human life?  If things became bad enough, the Party would be at risk of great power conflict, to say nothing of internal strife as food shortages and natural disasters worsened.  In the early 2000s, the CCP came to the conclusion that, before things got too bad, they would either have to: (i) develop a new sustainable technology infrastructure with the reliability, safety and efficiency of fossil fuels, or (ii) see to it that large numbers of people ceased to exist.  They decided the second option would be easier.</p>
<p>It all went according to plan.  In late 2019, a number of government agents released samples of SARS-CoV-2 around the city of Wuhan, China.  The official government line was that the virus came from the local wet market, but those in possession of even the slightest bit of skepticism saw instantly that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the obvious culprit.  Of course, the actual virus had been developed in a secret government installation in Xinjiang, but better to leave a nice juicy conspiracy in plain view to satiate the appetites of the curious.</p>
<p>As the world fell to infection, the other shoe was prepared to drop.  The virus had been encoded with a kind of "switch" that, when properly flipped, would trigger a deadly and incurable prion infection.  The switch-flipping agent was a second virus, which would be released in a market in Cairo, Egypt and would be called the Omega Variant in the press.  Before this occurred, Pfizer and Moderna, at the behest of United States intelligence, had been granted unprecedented leeway to develop mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, which included an antidote to the prion agent.  The CCP had expected something like this, and it didn't matter much to them.  As long as they took out the developing world, it was irrelevant that North America and Europe hung out for the afterparty.  After much cajoling and mandating, even breaking down doors and forcing jabs into arms, the Western powers had to accept that they wouldn't be able to save everyone.</p>
<p>The rest, as they say, was history.</p></p>
