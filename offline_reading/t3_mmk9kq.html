    <strong>My parents are heavily considering getting the vaccine, and I’m just incredibly stressed out.</strong>
    <p><p>Like the title says, my parents are talking about getting the vaccine. My mom has RA, and my dad has lupus, and their shitty rheumatologist is trying to convince them.</p>
<p>My mom has had Covid twice, and so is a little more reluctant to get it, since she’s survived the illness with her age and pre-existing condition.
I understand the concern about my dad getting Covid, his health is definitely precarious. Which is exactly why I’m majorly concerned about him getting this wildly untested and risky vaccine. The man has Lupus, a clotting disorder, and is on a bunch of heart medications after having to have a valve replaced about 5 years ago.</p>
<p>I keep sending my mom info about the vaccine, evidence of how much damage it can and HAS done to people, but it doesn’t seem to be affecting their decision much. She keeps saying “well, we’ve heard the Johnson &amp; Johnson one is the best one”.</p>
<p>Look, I get they’re adults and can make their own decision. It’s not mine to make. But lemme tell you, the anxiety is still there. I’m just so worried that this shitty ass vaccine could be what ends up taking out my dad, after all he’s already survived with his Lupus. But I don’t really know what else I can say to them to change their minds.</p>
<p>They’re also both on Hydrozychloroquine for their autoimmune diseases, which is why I believe my dad hasn’t gotten Covid, and why my mom did so well with it both times.</p></p>

        <p>My parents both got it. They're okay so far, at least. Each person has to make their own choices in life. If yours are going to get it, it is what it is. No use in stressing about it, all you can do is warn them.</p>

        <p>If they are going to get it regardless of how you try to convince them, you might as well pretend to be supportive. The placebo affect does wonders, and you want to be a positive supportive person.... Even if it's not for you</p>

        <p>Honestly, the craziest thing to me in all of this, is how easily manipulated older people have been lately. Like... You've literally lived through <em>so many confirmed instances</em> of your government and media lying to you. Shit I've only read about, you've <em>lived through.</em> And you're still like this??? I don't understand how it's happening.</p>

        <p>Fear, same method as always. People tend to adopt the strangest rules and obey the stupidest policies if they're fearful. Look at theft for instance, why do most people never steal stuff, it's literally free stuff. The answer is simple, they fear the consequences. The risk is higher than the reward.</p>
