    <strong>I no longer care about this world</strong>
    <p><p>2019 was a great year for me, I was able to accomplish many of my long term goals, and the future seemed very bright.</p>
<p>Until early this year, even thou I was a little bit of a cynic, and I've always thought that most people are just dumb, I was at heart an optimist, who thought most people had good intentions, and education was the way to go forward as a society, and that in the end, even if there were struggles in the way, society as a whole goes forward.</p>
<p>I no longer hold those beliefs.</p>
<p>This year I saw that even people that I looked up to, and people I believed to be different than "most dumb people", when enough pressure is applied, they will go full tard, and they are even more dangerous, because of their record.</p>
<p>This is the year that Pseudo-Science won over actual Science, were Science became synonymous with certain authority figures, and dogma, to an scale I've never seen before.</p>
<p>And this is the year were I understood that most people are willing to not just sacrifice just about everything about themselves, but force others as sacrifices if there is enough fear.</p>
<p>I lost respect for so many people, and lost hope for the future of humanity.</p>
<p>People, in somewhat paradoxical way, while chanting "I care about others", they have shown with actions how little they give a fuck about the future of others, how little they really care about the suffering of others, and how easy they will ridiculice other's suffering if it is inconvenient.</p>
<p>The future seems bleak, and no one gives a fuck. I cannot even see my parents, who live in another country, and hell knows if I EVER will be able to see them again, or how much effort and money it will take in a post-covid world to do that.</p>
<p>Most of my goals for the future seem so meaningless right now. I love research, and I wanted to continue doing it, but I cannot in good faith continue supporting academia, when the institutions are so full of shit, and pushing for a worse world with pseudo science.</p>
<p>Even thou I live in a country with no lockdowns, and were most business are open, I'm avoiding to go out, not because I fear COVID or anything like that, but because it is so infuriating, and so frustrating to see so much stupidity around me.</p>
<p>Every time I see a plexiglass window I want to fucking destroy it, or at least scream to the owner of the business how much of a fucking tard he is for believing that a piece of plastic can prevent you from getting infected.</p>
<p>Every time I hear about the number of infections, I hear about "wear a mask", I see seats being blocked to "prevent the spread", I look at the stupid alcohol bottles in the entrance of every store, I hear about how friends who went to the hospital to check on something were forced to get a PCR test, I see random masks as a new "merchandise" for almost everything, I just want to disappear from this world full of retardation.</p>
<p>I cannot longer look at normal people, who push BS that makes the world a worst place with good eyes, and I cannot see "the good on them", because even if there is, is meaningless with their actions.</p>
<p>I blame everyone of them for what is going on, and my only hope is that in the future they all with have to pay, even if it is with their conscience.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for a fucked up 2020, and I'm not at all looking forward to how much stupid and completely crazy people will get in 2021.</p></p>

        <p>I understand how the German people went along with the Nazis more now.</p>
<p>There is so much social pressure to go along to get along, it doesn't take much.  Perhaps the fear of the virus replaces the fear of reprisal against Nazi authorities.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Göring:</em></strong><br>
<em>Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Gilbert:</em></strong><br>
<em>There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Göring:</em></strong><br>
<em>Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.</em></p>
<p>— Excerpt rom a private discussion between Hermann Göring &amp; Gustave Gilbert, a German-speaking American intelligence officer, during the Nuremberg Trials, in Göring's jail cell</p>

<p>That particular sentence is very remarkable, though.</p>

        <p>Earlier this say, another comment in this sub reminded me of this scene from Mr Robot :</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Psychiatrist:</strong><br>
What is it about society that disappoints you so much?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Elliot:</strong><br>
Oh I don't know, is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit; the world itself's just one big hoax. Spamming each other with our burning commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy but because we wanna be sedated. Because it's painful not to pretend, because we're cowards.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Fuck Society.</p>
<p>Way ahead of its time!</p>

        <p>I'm just here to see the collapse at this point. Making sure my money is good and buying food and supplies to prepare myself. Working on selling my home and moving off the grid. I hope the rich work from home types get swarmed by angry people whove lost their jobs. French revolution was basically this exact thing. Rich people destroying poor people's lives and expecting no retaliation. Well, we'll see how long that works out for them.</p>

<p>The seeds for revolution are definitely being sown.</p>
<p>I just saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiDIHS1Lk0Q&amp;feature=emb_title">this Dutch documentary</a>, made by a Dutch entrepeneur, where several intellectuals with various backgrounds (including multiple professors) were preaching what I can only describe as revolutionary language reminiscent of that preceding the French revolution. They made it abundantly clear that the ultra-rich getting ever more rich while the rest of us are getting ever poorer is becoming ever more untenable.</p>
<p>We sure live in... exciting times!</p>

        <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of authoritarian dystopia. </p>
<p>Shit will <em>really</em> hit the fan as climate collapse accelerates over the decade and basic infrastructure starts collapsing. California's already dealing with rolling blackouts every summer like it's the freaking Soviet Union. The authoritarian restrictions we're living with will seem like child's play compared to the mass death, famines and wars that are coming up.</p>

        <p>&rt;Most of my goals for the future seem so meaningless right now. I love research, and I wanted to continue doing it, but I cannot in good faith continue supporting academia, when the institutions are so full of shit, and pushing for a worse world with pseudo science.</p>
<p>Don't let them win. You're stronger than that. You can research truth and expose lies. The one good thing coming out of this disaster is that more people are starting to question the narrative. Focus on them and move forward.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I'm also an academic, moved in 2019 to a country away from almost everyone I loved, but it was fine because I had a great job that offered me plenty of time and freedom to visit. That job has since been taken away by covid, my new job is far more demanding. I don't get to see my family or friends. I only get to get up, go to my desk, work, call it a day, feel negative thoughts start creeping in, choose to continue working or drink, rinse and repeat. It's fucking hell, I have very little faith in improvement - covid might go away but the world will never be the same. </p>
<p>I'm thinking of finding a nice spot somewhere in Mexico or Brazil to call home depending on how things go in 2021. The first world is quickly becoming a dystopian hellscape. Spending the rest of my days dropping out of life with bong in hand and drinking tequila doesn't seem half bad, come with me.</p>

        <p>The book "The closing of the American mind" by Allan Bloom in 1987 presaged the complete corruption of academia. It is all about money. There is no such thing as "science" now, it is all religious dogma. The current worldwide events have proven that the lientific orthodoxy is in control! It goes back to the 1930s when Rockerfeller bought the medical establishment and schools to push products made from his petroleum. So we are talking about a well entrenched cancer going back almost a century. There ain't no cure as it has taken over everything!</p>

        <p>I feel this. I really do. Every little reminder makes my blood boil. I constantly want to break stuff and either mute or exile everyone that thinks Covid is a huge deal. This should have been a time for the world to come together and fight against a common enemy. Instead they used it as a weapon to turn us against each other, get Trump out of office and promote Communism and Fascism. I hate it all.</p>

        <p>I relate to you very much. I also have family locked behind borders, I've lost everything I've worked for for the past half decade, I don't know how to handle it mentally. I understand now how previously normal people can be driven into crippling mental illness and suicide. 
I see the mass hysteria and understand how fascist and communist empires rise and commit mass murder with policy.
I hate everything, I don't want to witness the destruction in my own life or society any more.</p>
