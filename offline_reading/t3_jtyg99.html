        <p>One of my regular battles are against "big food".</p>
<p>I'm an organic vegetable, pastured chicken grower. I sell directly to customers.</p>
<p>So many of my customers were quite supportive of Beyond Meat and other similar industrial nasty fake food that can't be made in a regular kitchen. And if you attempted to recreate these 'foods', your kitchen would resemble a laboratory before you're halfway done. </p>
<p>Ultra-processed food is becoming more of an issue than ever. People are becoming more and more lazy to cook at home. 
Yet they trust megacorporations to give them the most healthy, nutritious foods.
Believe me, they don't care what they put in processed foods, they don't care about your health. </p>
<p>It's in your best interest to find a local farmer who can help you have access to fresh, healthy, nutritious, immune enhancing food. </p>
<p>If I could recommend one book (audiobook), it would be 'Folk's this ain't normal' by Joel Salatin. </p>
<p>Read it. Seriously.</p>

        <p>I’m 100% anti-lockdown, but as a Vegan I support this. Downvote me to oblivion if you want. We need to stop oppressing other animals and start caring for the Earth and its myriad ecosystems and environments.</p>

        <p>I don’t think those are mutually exclusive. You can be vegan and oppose the monopolising of the food industry by a couple of corporations. </p>
<p>The point of the article isn’t to shit on vegans, but to point out the globalist takeover of the entire agricultural market. Also the impossible burger containing 11 times the levels of glyphosphate as its competitors isn’t good. If you know anything about glyphosphate, you’ll know.</p>

        <p>You're not a real vegan if you support lab-made immitation of food. Also I can't trust very rich people when it comes to sustainability and caring about the environment, they didn't make their fortune growing organic linen or spinach or something. It's naive to think that. Klaus 'Adolf' Schwabb looks like someone who enjoys large quantities of pork, I don't really get a vegan vibe off him.</p>
<p>I want people to eat less meat, I really do. I'm against someone else having control over what ordinary people like you and me eat though. If these money hoarders actually brainwashed the population into thinking that veganism is cool and consooming too much is bad we could have ended up with a bunch of hippies growing their own food and using only second hand clothes and electronics in just 6 months. Instead we got a bunch of angry authoritarian germaphobes and hypochondriacs. Influencing masses is a powerful thing and they could've used it for something good but they chose not to. I don't think these people give a damn about sustainability.</p>
