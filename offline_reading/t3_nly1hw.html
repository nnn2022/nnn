        <p>It's bittersweet for me. I love having this community because it's like a bastion of sanity and it's nice to be reminded I'm not alone and not everyone is blind.</p>

        <p>I really don't know man. Even in California where I'm from there are a ton of people who are skeptical about everything. </p>
<p>I work for a pretty woke company and many people I work with aren't getting the vaccine. My sister and BIL got it only because their jobs require it and they don't wear masks anywhere. My mom got it because of her job and only wears a mask because she doesn't wanna give retail workers a hard time. I see hundreds of people every day without a mask, in fact it's weird when someone does have one.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people in real life don't care. It's only on the internet that people get so riled up</p>

        <p>Yeah that's maybe true. It's easy to look around and feel totally alone, but it's not like I'm talking to everyone. I'm sure skeptical people look at me wearing a mask in the supermarket and assume I'm not thinking about any of this.</p>
<p>But then a lot of my friends, my partner, my colleagues, my barber, they're all in on this stuff. Not questioning any of it, just waiting for the vaccine to save them. Just this morning I overheard my partner on a work call and they were all animatedly talking about booking their appointments. "Can't wait!" etc. If people want to get it that's their prerogative but I can tell with so many it's because they've been duped by the propaganda. </p>
<p>Even my fucking xbox dashboard is telling me to get it.</p>

        <p>In Germany everyone wears a mask in stores and a lot of people even outside or in their cars when they are alone and no one is nearby. Went for a walk in the woods and met 2 fathers with 3 children... all including the children wore masks and the kids were playing on their mobile phones.</p>
<p>And a LOT of people get vaccinated.. I feel it's more than 50% where I live but that is just a feeling from talking to customers...</p>
<p>One custoner already told me her friend got 2nd shot of Pfizer and was in a coma 2 days later.. some don't have any side effects (for now) but I have a couple of my regulars not showing up anymore... I always am thinking hopefully they did not get delayed side effects or whatever...</p>

        <p>Sure it's possible but it's fairly clear a lot of them haven't done any research beyond what they hear on the news each night. One friend called people who aren't getting the shot "anti-vaxxers" with such conviction and another actually said "I don't care I don't want to look" when I tried to show them studies on the efficacy of mask mandates. Wouldn't even to look at something that would challenge his preconceived belief.</p>

        <p>I'm not a fan when people don't challenge their beliefs, specifically when it comes to things like this whole situation. And to be clear, it's people on "both" sides. I don't like to say that there are sides, that makes it seem like just because we don't agree we are somehow adversaries. We're all just people (rightfully) skeptical about what the government, the media, corporations, etc, say and push because they all have an agenda and rarely if ever does it align with the best interests of the people.</p>

        <p>&rt; Is it at all possible they've done research like you have and simply arrived at a different conclusion?</p>
<p>I'd love it if more people did do research including reading scientific papers and parsing through government databases. I've spent hundreds of hours doing exactly that over the last 16 months including building my own computer models. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of people I know have formed their assessments from reading mainstream media articles. That approach usually works fine for most things but occasionally something extraordinary happens and trusting media to parse and summarize accurately fails. That's what's happened over the last year.</p>
<p>I'm opened minded with everyone I talk to and try to understand the basis for their assessments about CV19, lockdowns, masks, etc. What's strange is how many people have <em>very</em> strong opinions yet have no depth to back it up. </p>
<p>There are a lot of things I don't known much about and I tend to not have strong opinions about those areas. CV19 is something that I now understand far better than anyone I know. My assessments aren't based on media or politics. My views are grounded in empirical source data that I can show anyone that's willing to take the time to understand. Very few are willing to invest even half an hour in actually understanding the data.</p>

        <p>I don't have a degree in virology, epidemiology, microbiology, immunology, or any other relevant advanced medical degree. What use would reading scientific papers and parsing government databases do for me. </p>
<p>You could give me the exact science, nothing hidden, of how the vaccines were developed and tested, what they're made of, all that jazz,  and I would be unable to determine how safe and effective they are. </p>
<p>At some point you're trusting the opinion of someone or some organization that had more information than you do. How do you determine who to trust? What makes your source better than mine (this is a hypothetical question, not like a let's start an argument question)?</p>

<li>
<p>Makes no sense. "common consensus in real life" isn't a thing, and doesn't exist. That's not what these words mean.  </p>

<li>
<p>Not even true in spirit. Indeed, opinions on reddit are somewhat indicative of what society thinks.</p>

It’s mind blowing how most of them just did it out of peer pressure or because they wanted to travel yet our state has been open and maskless for months.</p>

        <p>I don’t buy it. Last I heard it was 100,000,000 had at least one, no word on how many got two. The threshold for vaccine acceptance is going back for round two.  If one third got one, and a significant number didn’t get two, that would explain why they have lotteries to attract dumb people into getting it.</p>

        <p>Well, we're all adults, students and professors in Uni, and we can assess the risks and benefits of not wearing a dirty reusable mask or a nondegradable single use mask all day long, and not a single one of us came to the conclusion we should actually wear it (and if someone does they can, they can also continue studying through zoom if they want)</p>
<p>Personally I just can't see people wearing masks anymore, it feels wrong to me, humans are probably the animals that rely the most on facial cues to communicate, we have dozens of facial muscles that developed over tens of millions of years just for that, it's honestly difficult for me to talk to people in general and masks and social distancing make it much worst, and I'm definitely not the only one</p>

        <p>Exactly. Overheard some people the other day in my class talking about the vaccine and it’s just sad to listen to how brainwashed they are. Like it’s really really sad to see how easily manipulated humans can be.</p>

        <p>I always knew but didn't want to believe it (the manipulation part).  This past year has shown me how true it is.  Even people who I've known for years who are extremely skeptical about everything and question everything constantly have fallen in line.</p>

        <p>Yep. My best friend who I thought was smart enough to make her own decisions got the vaccine. And it’s like walking in a minefield when talking to her with slightly controversial issues now :(. Sometimes I just wish it was 2016 again when I was ignorant to these idiotic things tbh.</p>

        <p>Ever think that she is smart enough to make her own decision and it was the vaccine? I made the decision to do so and I am pretty critical of a lot of this shit. Covid is real (Maybe it's a bad flu) either way it has killed people I know.</p>

        <p>I mean she’s a perfectly healthy person that doesn’t get the annual flu vax so I don’t understand why she got the covid one. She’s not at risk of dying from it either, like I know it’s her body her choice, but I rather not get injected with an experimental vax and I figured she wouldn’t either. :/</p>

        <p>I get it. It's hard to wrap our heads around this stuff sometimes. It's why so many of us fight with family over politics. Everyone is right lol. Truth is, there is only one truth and there are so many people lying to us that we just have to pick one a go with it hoping its the right one. Educated of course.I just think we need some calm right now. It's constant this that the other thing. Just love your friend and I guess if you believe in the shedding thing (Bullshit by my reconing) wear a mask but spend time with her without talking/thinking to much about the vaxx.Thanks, I was goin for something a little gross lol.</p>

        <p>I'm anti mask for sure, but I'll wear it if I have to. There's some services that I NEED that make me wear a mask. Also if I'm meeting someone and they have a mask on, I'll wear mine out of respect. I'm not anti vaxx either. I'm anti mRNA. Honestly even with future data, i'd be skeptical of taking the shot. If covid is over, why would I need it? I wouldn't, so I won't ever get it.</p>

        <p>It'll die down but covid is gunna be endemic. Or perhaps it could shift to other social issues. That might be kind of nice.<br>
We could get involved in fighting the sale of our public parks for rich folks ski resorts and country clubs, I dunno.</p>

        <p>I was thinking this also. Maybe we should turn it into a Sub to help people who did struggle during the pandemic. The pandemic might have ended, but it's going to last forever now. We will hear about it for the rest of our lives, so there will always be more to talk about it. We can discuss how crazy people went during it. We can also aid people who have not recovered from the Pandemic. I've seen some people on here mention that they have lost their jobs and stuff, so we should provide support. That is, if this pandemic ever does end.</p>

        <p>Doomers are really over-represented on Reddit due to the type of people that kind of thinking and this site attracts. Depending on where you go, they actually aren't as much of a majority as you might think, and some places they are a tiny minority.</p>
<p>My personal anecdote for this is having gone to Cedar Point last weekend and seen very little in the way of masks and no talk/concern about the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/kfUn0Mu.png">unspecified virus of unknown origin</a>.</p>

        <p>Last time we had lockdowns was more than a year ago here in Serbia. So if you ask me we are "as normal" as we can be in this crazy world.
But don't worry, there are a lkt of us like you in this world. We may be from different continents but we are all in the same boat. I hope that all of us can go as close as we can back to normal soon</p>

        <p>About double the size of r / lockdownskepticism at this point.   They started censoring people hard -- early on it was mask discussions that the mods censored -- and people stopped subbing there.</p>
<p>We see a much wider spectrum of opinions here and some opinion groups are probably numerically overrepresented because they have no place else to go.   To that I just say "welcome!"</p>
