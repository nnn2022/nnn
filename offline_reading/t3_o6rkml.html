    <strong>Has anyone else noticed that law firm commercials have pivoted their commercials from pharma injury to personal injury/ work related injury?</strong>
    <p><p>Lawyers seem to be wrapped around the system's finger for some reason. You would think that covid tyranny would be a lawyer's paradise, but no lawyer will touch anything Covid related. The very few that have, have failed miserably, because the judges also are afraid to go against the power structure.</p>
<p>Not only that, but I haven't seen a single commercial for these lawyers seeking out victims of drug injury since the vaccine began to be pushed heavily. Normally I see them constantly. I am seeing a lot of law firm commercials though, and they seem to be going after work related injury and stuff like this. It's like they have been told to not remind the public of other drugs that have caused injury and death. So not only are the drug companies sitting pretty with liability protection for vaccines, they are less likely to get sued for other drug mishaps too. Unless it's being done quietly.</p>
<p>This type of thing makes me sick. And it's an industry that's almost impossible to boycott. Furthermore, India and Canada's drugs are a fraction of the price. Why are we putting up with this?</p></p>

        <p>The pharmaceutical companies have blanket immunity for the vaccines.  They cannot be sued for damages. That's why there's no commercials for it. You literally cannot sue them.</p>

        <p>Yep, I mentioned that in the post. But they CAN (and usually do) get sued for other medications/ medical devices. And that's what I'm referring to. Those commercials have disappeared. It's like they don't want us reminded of how unsafe ANY of their products are.</p>

        <p>I know they definitely did in NY. They dropped the need for documentation that normally is required, made it so they couldn't get sued for malpractice, and eliminated autopsies for those who "died of covid". That in combination with getting paid to vent patients, and getting paid when patients died. Coincidentally no family is allowed in to keep an eye on things. Only the extremely naive can't see what was going on here.</p>
