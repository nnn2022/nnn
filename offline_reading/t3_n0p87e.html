        <p>Lemme help you out....So, you just take how many people supposedly died of covid, and that’s how many were over counted. They have never published anything that proves that that covid actually is a new disease. Also, they’ve never published anything that proves that the coronavirus is contagious, and they have never published anything to prove that the coronavirus causes any disease. Number is zero my friend.</p>

        <p>will admit I do think the thing is real and I've had it myself, during which I was struck down worse than I was then when I'm normally ill from what I can remember so whilst I'm skeptical of lockdowns and so on I believe it to be real, but I haven't looked into it so I won't judge</p>

        <p>If you really truly believe that you had it, then your own negative thoughts about it could have made it a lot worse for you. It’s like when a witch doctor points a bone at someone, and tells them that they will die in 3 days...and because that person believed it so much, that in 3 days, they were dead. Your thoughts can make you sick, or even kill you.</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying but I was never scared or hysterical about covid tbh, so I wasn't exaggerating anything when what seemed to be covid made me bedridden due to the intensity of the fever.</p>

        <p>A fever is something that your body creates to detoxify itself. Being poisoned by chemicals, or radiation has the same symptoms as the mythical virus does. Remember when the media, and the internet went completely bat shit crazy, when people were saying that covid is caused by 5G? I’ve never seen such a over the top reaction to debunk something ever. </p>
<p>The internet was page after page of fact checkers saying that 5G does not cause covid, and really pushed the narrative that people who believe that are crazy conspiracy theorists. A lot of channels on YouTube nuked. Why? If it wasn’t true, why go so hard to debunk it. </p>
<p>Why were they feverishly putting up 5G infrastructure starting day one of the first lockdown...and putting it up in the middle of the night? Doesn’t make sense. I wasn’t under lockdown because of my job, and I saw that shit with my own eyes. </p>
