    <p><p>“These men are not guided by practical use of unprejudiced historical observation, but by theoretical routine without any critical regard for consequent results. We need not, therefore, take any account of them - let them amuse themselves until the hour strikes, or live on hopes of new forms of enterprising pastime, or on the memories of all they have enjoyed. For them let that play the principal part which we have persuaded them to accept as the dictates of science (theory). It is with this object in view that we are constantly, by means of our press, arousing a blind confidence in these theories. The intellectuals of them will puff themselves up with their knowledge and without any logical verification of them will put into effect all the information available from science, which our agency specialists have cunningly pieced together for the purpose of educating their minds in the direction we want.”</p></p>
