    <strong>The one byproduct of this that has sent me over the edge.</strong>
    <p><p>Bullying.</p>
<p>This lockdown is a bullies wet dream. It's common place now to use a political / social cause as a proxy to attack people. Racial injustice? Don't just protest peacefully - torch down your entire neighborhood. People getting sick over a virus? Turn in your neighbors and chase maskless people out of a store. Different political opinions? Send the tweet to his employer and get him fired.</p>
<p>You know, I am stunned that any of us here have adjusted to this type of social climate. It is appalling. Yes, you maskless people may feel confident walking into a store with your bare face showing but the stories of harassment are countless. You KNOW it's bad when there were no words thrown at you and you did your shopping in peace - think about how low the bar is set.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The estimated time for "NoRmAliTy" is 2022 from what we're seeing. Fauci wants 90% of the population vaccinated and even in my state they've said that you still need masks / social distancing even after the vax. So what will come of this? Yeah, even if you don't need a mask in years to come - you'll still be beaten down and viewed as a subhuman virus carrier for not having the jab.</p>
<p>This may be common sense to some people but that's just how far we've fallen. Please think about this! It is now acceptable to harass, attack, curse off, mistreat, and publicly shame those who are not wearing a mask. Those who are meeting their family. Those who share a different, LESS sensational and catastrophic view of the virus. Even in other subreddits I've been told "Listen, moron! Shut the fuck up and wear your mask!". These are disgusting, foul people. Normal healthy minds do not feel comfortable speaking to others this way, if anything they feel ashamed. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've heard that when someone comes into money that it really brings out their true character. It may amplify their kindness or show that they're a piece of shit. Well this is the bullies social currency. They are rich and can get away with any type of mistreatment they please. Why do you think no one wants to hear good news! Because if things were clearing up and life was returning to normal, you may say "Buddy, relax. People aren't dying anymore, stop attacking the guy".... Sorry for the long rant, I just cannot believe that we have allowed people to treat this way. Where the NeW NorMaL means the allowance and acceptance of deeming one class of people as subhumans.</p></p>

        <p>I’m glad other people have noticed this this. Although a lot of people are shameless virtue signaling bullies, I think the majority of people would agree this is insanity.</p>

        <p>Accurate summation of the situation, human nature has been so sterilized by our society that with the right excuse the group dynamics that are hardwired into our minds violently manifest themselves. It seems that Americans have increasingly irreconcilable differences and it is not going to end well.</p>

        <p>“Bullying” is just a codeword for violence and intimidation by those in power. When it’s done by the majority, we call it bullying. When it’s done by the minority we call it terrorism.</p>
