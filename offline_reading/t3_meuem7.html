        <p>The news has been pounding that belief into their heads, and they're too lazy to investigate further. Of course they believe that. Most believe that catching it means you skip the hospital and go to the morgue. I knew a person who was diagnosed with covid because he lost his sense of smell for a couple days and was sent home to "recuperate", and was very surprised that the news had put false ideas into his head. But the look on his face was pretty funny.</p>
<p>But thanks for that Gallup Survey for pointing out what we already know.</p>

<p>The story was everywhere for days. At that point, young people weren't taking anything seriously. A local bar had recently come under the cancel culture gun from doomers for having their usual St Patrick's Day block party. Then suddenly we get inundated by propaganda about this 39 year old healthy woman that just dropped dead in her kitchen and the media went into overdrive to point out how covid was killing young people. </p>
<p>Only problem was that the test came back negative for covid. Then her doctor was interviewed and said he <em>didn't believe</em> the test. So he ordered another one. Also negative. Then it came out she was possibly an addict and did have other problems. Of course the media dropped the story. But by that time the damage was done and all the 20 and 30 somethings began to freak out and the media's goal was accomplished. Been wasting away again in masker retardville ever since.</p>

        <p>I remember this story. She most likely died from a pulmonary embolism (even more likely if she was taking birth control). Had her doctors not been so fixated on COVID, maybe they could have done a proper PE workup or at least obtained imaging of her chest and perhaps it could have been caught before she died. </p>
<p>Something similar happened to a patient of mine, although he didn’t die, thankfully. He was experiencing excruciating headaches, but his PCP refused to do a physical exam due to fear of catching COVID. He conducted his “visits” with patients while making them stay in their cars in the parking lot while he maintained 6 ft. of distance from the car. He just kept ordering COVID test after COVID test and prescribed antibiotics in case of a sinus infection. Of course, all the tests were negative. Turns out, he had a BRAIN TUMOR.</p>

        <p>I recently got into a discussion about Covid, lockdowns, masks, etc., with my half brother. He’s 22 and part of the whole younger doomer virtue signaling crowd that thinks Covid is a literal death sentence for any age. </p>
<p>We got into talking some of the numbers. First of all he didn’t even know how many people had died from Covid in the U.S., he thought it was “around a million”. Didn’t know how many people live in this country. And certainly had no idea how many people die normally in this country every year from all causes. </p>
<p>It was pretty eye opening. So these people don’t even know the basic numbers, let alone putting them into any context or comparison. </p>
<p>It really infuriates me to no end. I’ve spent literally hundreds of hours over the past year looking at the data, looking at historical data, comparing states, comparing countries, doing endless research into this. I’ve tried looking at this whole thing from every angle possible to try and understand why people are panicking so much. But when you look at the data as extensively as I have, it just isn’t there. But then when you find out that most of the doomers don’t even know the basic of all basic numbers related to this, you realize how we got to where we are. So depressing the situation we’re in.</p>
<p>EDIT: and the thing that really gets me is these same people will continually say we’re doing all this because of <em>science</em>. But they don’t even know the absolute basic numbers. It’s maddening.</p>

        <p>This brings to mind an incident in my life.  I was about to do my first commercial dive and the foreman was telling me stories about divers being buried alive, fatally injured in dredgers, etc.</p>
<p>I finally stopped him and asked, "Are you telling me these stories to try to see if I'll be too afraid to do the job?" He said, "yes". I told him it isn't going to work. I finished suiting up and went into the dive.</p>
<p>It was a kind of test, you see.  To see if I was too risk averse.</p>
<p>A lot of people live in fear, deep fear.  I don't hate them for it, but I do feel a bit sorry for them.  It is when they use their fear to compel me to certain action or inaction that we have a beef.</p>

        <p>As soon as this all started I began researching annual death rates, mask efficiency, mRNA, and coronavirus(es). It was incredibly eye opening and red pilled my ass with a quickness. Before that I would only fact check things I saw on social media because I had been slowly learning that the media fudges the truth and my dumber friends looked stupid as hell reposting that garbage. </p>
<p>How do people go through life never questioning things? I can't understand it. If I see one more #stopasianhate advert or post I am going to fucking scream. How can people not see that it's propaganda? How can people not see the Suez Canal incident wasn't an accident after all TPTB have put us through in the last year?</p>

        <p>In the beginning of all this last year, I would try to put it into perspective with everyone I talked to. I took it seriously, but some people had the shit scared out of them and I wanted to talk some sense into then. Even my doctor told me it wasn't that big of a deal and to not worry because you will end up catching it but will be fine.</p>
<p>The number one thing I explained to them is that besides child birth, pneumonia is the greatest cause for hospitalization of adults in the US. After it went on, I just extrapolated the data and predicted worse case scenario was a million deaths at most in a country full of 350 million people and those deaths would be the majority sick and old. I went high because I didn't want them dunking on me and acting like I was playing it down. Then when they finally came out with the breakdown of mortality by age, that is what I used. At a certain age bracket, the flu becomes more deadly.</p>
<p>Our problem was never people not taking it serious, it was the media scaring the ever loving shit out of people. Everyone from all political spectrums took it serious, but in my group it was just that conservatives that started thinking about the long term effects of the NPI's that were being put in place. In hind site, I think a lot of the death will be analyzed with previous years numbers, and we will learn that many were probably treated for and died of Covid, when it was probably something else. Imagine trying to get treatment for bacterial pneumonia during all this. You would have most certainly just been diagnosed with Covid, or thrown on the Covid ward until you had that too.</p>

        <p>More than 1/3 of America at one time believed George W was behind 9-11. Same numbers for people who think Trump was a KGB agent. I have met many people who have said Bill Clinton wasn’t impeached. Most Americans can’t point out other states on the map let alone other countries. Our STEM fields and graduate schools are filled with immigrants and the children of immigrants. So how did we get here? Well at least one third of the country is clearly fucking retarded as history shows is tradition.</p>

        <p>Yep. I have noticed Americans react way different to this pandemic then Europeans. Examples are them thinking children will get killed in mass if schools reopen. Where Europeans think children are immune but disease carriers.</p>

        <p>That was really good work. People who are rightfully suspicious of the POTUS are as "retarded" as people who can't find states on a map, then toss in a little immigrantphobia to make this sub look alt-right. You're a world-class bullshit artist.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the name is pretty good. It made me re-read the post twice to make sure I was reading it correctly. I end up blocking these types of users because I don't want to accidentally upvote them or reply favorably to them in the future if they write some sort of truth-mixed-with-lies "controlled opposition" mindfuck post. Because sometimes they don't make it so obvious in every post, sometimes they will alternate all truth in one post, and then all falsehoods in another post.</p>

        <p>We are on a "pandemic" and not one outlet has showed statistics in good faith. No honest per capita stats or cases vs deaths or any of the awesome news the charts can show. Straight up lies for a year and people are convinced of anything. The real information is a google search away but people don't really know how to search information. They get distracted by another fear mongering article before seeing the data hidden in plain site.</p>
