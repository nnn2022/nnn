    <strong>Change my Mind.</strong>
    <p><p>I have been arguing with a member of this sub for the past few days about Covid and how people are responding. But I do realize that I have to consider other people's arguments. So, I have decided to ask a few questions:
1.) Why not wear masks? Covid has a higher death rate than the flu. 
2.) Don't you think that we're progressing back to normal?
3.) Will you take the vaccine).
4.) Why do you have an issue with wearing masks and lockdowns? Yeah, it sucks, but elderly people are at risk of dying, along with a small number of normal healthy people, and a lot of immunocompromised people. And yes, we don't shut down because of the flu, but only recently did we get a vaccine, and we wanted to save as many as we could. I've personally had three family friends die of Covid.</p>
<p>This post is meant to be a discussion. All I ask is for coherent arguments that make sense.</p></p>

        <p>Firstly, whole idea that I am responsible for someone's else's health is BS. I am solely responsible for my health and if I am care giver to someone else. That goes for everyone. And your sense of feeling safe shouldn't cost my liberties. That's simple as that. I take my precautions and actions to keep myself healthy and so should you, don't expect me to feel guilty if you catch a flu or whtv, I won't be blaming anyone either but rather reflect if I didn't took care well enough of myself to fall ill.</p>

        <p>Lot to unpack here. Again, yes you are solely responsible for your health, but you really should follow guidelines to prevent spread. Because guess what? No matter how much your "liberties" are hurt, you have to face the facts. And when scientists and doctors who have way more knowledge than you and I ask you to do a certain things, you should probably do it.</p>

        <p>Nope, those people are not going to tell me how to live my life. You go ahead and believe a man in TV will tell you how to be safe, I have my own head on my shoulders and understand about my health better than a person on big TV  who wouldn't bat an eye if I or you or anyone else died. If you still believe this is about saving lives- our conversation is over. Just as stupid to think that they care about you, yet never encouraged people to live more healthy throughout the whole time of lockdown. Alcohol still widely available, fast food still there, ciggies yup, go ahead. Check stats how many people those things are killing or contributing to terrible diseases. Yet gov never banned them, CUZ THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU, it's about money you sandwich. You're clearly too naive for this world sir. Best of luck.</p>

        <p>Naive? You're clearly too arrogant to realize that scientists and doctors know better than us. If money was their main priority, don't you think they would want states to reopen, for the economy to start turning again, to get more money? I'm not watching a man on TV. I'm looking at the facts. How much do you really know about your health? How about how diseases work? Because those scientists, those doctors, they understand it much better than you and I. Live healthy during lockdown? That's kinda obvious. They didn't say, Hey, drink alcohol during lockdown, or eat unhealthy food. Fact of the matter is that more people would die from the virus than the lockdowns. So you prioritize the virus first.</p>

        <p>Mate, please just watch doctor's that have been silenced during this pandemic. There's many of them. Go on DuckDuck go and to BitChute and watch thousands of doctor's whistleblowing and warning that this will lead to disaster. They really have no profit to going out there and spreading "misinformation", whilst big Pharma's and Governments make billions and get more power and control over us so I choose to believe DOCTOR'S who putting themselves out there to warn us (also check former Pfizer VP talking about vaxx). Try to think a bit more critically, open minded and search for the truth. Try to understand why there's so many of us crazy conspiracy theorist here trying to warn you about something terrible happening. You truly think we deluded fanatic's? Try dig in the story, 2nd WW and the timeline of HOW it happend. Swine Flu 1976 and their vaxx trials.  Try to look back at swine flu 2009 and how their rushed vaccine ONLY after a year caused thousands of people to develop narcolepsy (a terrible neurogical disease where you can sleep just couple hrs a day and eventually die). RESEARCH. Don't look just what's happening right now. Connect the dots. It's clear as a day once you see it. But don't blindly believe what narrative media is pushing onto everyone right now. Please carefully do your reading and you will understand what this is really about.</p>

        <p>1: Wear a mask if it makes you feel better. By all means, but don't make it mandatory and don't shame others for not wanting to - particularly those who have a medical exemption. They don't owe anyone an explaination. For years I've heard experts say and read articles about how masks are ineffective at stopping the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>2: No. It's been over a year of 15 days to slow the spread, and we are now talking seriously about segregating members of society who do not want to take the vaccine. This is in no way shape or form normal.</p>
<p>3: NO.</p>
<p>4: I don't give a fuck about masks. I am against lockdowns because they are hurting more than they are helping. I'm sorry you know people who have died. If you don't mind me asking, how old were they?</p>

        <p>Let's say they were around middle age. You know, starting to become grandparents, seeing their grandchildren growing up. They were happy people. You say masks don't work. But many scientists and doctors say they DO. Why? Because those droplets, through which Covid can spread, are more contained in masks. And yeah, lockdowns suck, but you know what's more terrible? Dying, being stuck on a ventilator. And before you say something along the lines of, "I know someone who got Covid, and they are fine.' I ask you to look at the 2 million people who have died. Clearly, they were not fine.</p>

        <p>Yep. People die. It sucks. 2.5. million people die globally <em>every year</em> from pneumonia.. what do you want to bet those numbers are way down for 2020.</p>
<p>To date I know 7 people personally who have tested positive and they are fine. My daughter has autism and is a year and a half behind getting into ABA and speech therapy because of this horseshit. I lost a friend to suicide last summer. If it wasn't for the lockdowns, he would still be alive, and unlike most people who die of covid, he had his whole life ahead of him.</p>
<p>And my daughter is already missing out on opportunities at a critical time in her development. So you know what? Fuck the greater good. I would personally smother your grandparents (in Minecraft) if it meant so many young people didn't have to suffer.</p>

        <p>Pneumonia is a problem, yes. But guess what? Covid spreads more than Pneumonia. Covid is like Pneumonia with some upgrades. If there was a contagious Pneumonia you could get by touching droplets, you probably would take precautions. And, we should what? Reopen? Your friend didn't die from lockdowns, he died from depression. If lockdowns were the tipping point for your friend, then I hate to be the one to break this to you, but they had issues long before that. And you really think you're the only one who has a loved one with Autism? Someone I care for has Autism, and they are a full grown teen. They're unable to talk, let alone do anything truly on their own. But you know what? My parents are in danger from COVID. If they get it, they could die. It's a shitty situation, but a lot more people will die from COVID than getting depressed in lockdown. You care so much about your daughter, yet you seem to lack the empathy for others who have loved ones who may die of Covid.</p>

        <p>1.) Why not wear masks?</p>
<p>Why would you want to breath back in your own carbon dioxide?</p>
<p>Don't you think that we're progressing back to normal? </p>
<p>Because the media and governors made this fiasco political, and the nature of politics, no, we will not be going back to normal.</p>
<p>3.) Will you take the vaccine </p>
<p>Would you fly in an airplane that was barely tested, and the airplane manufacturer has no liability in case of a crash, and you get seriously injured or worse get killed?</p>
<p>4.) Why do you have an issue with wearing masks and lockdowns? </p>
<p>Lockdowns have caused more harm economically, psychologically then the alleged virus itself. As for wearing masks, it is not about the mask itself, it is about being forced to wear it. If it was a real pandemic, you would see people wearing HazMat suits.</p>

<p>It's also a completely new (Moderna, Pfizer) or very new (AstraZeneca, J&amp;J) kind of airplane, too. In the case of the Moderna and Pfizer airplane, no human has ever flown it before we all collectively started our flying lessons.</p>

        <p>Um, what? This is a real pandemic. By the way, you do realize the masks don't make you breathe back your own carbon dioxide. You get air in and out like normal people. If we did get carbon monoxide back, we'd be dead. This isn't a political fiasco. It only became one with people started losing their shits about freedoms because they couldn't bear to put a mask on their face. Lockdowns suck, yeah, but 2 million people dying is much worse. Especially when some of those people are people that you know. Lockdowns work to a degree. They're meant to protect you until a vaccine or cure is found. Now that one has, we are getting back to normal. So I don't get your point? Not to mention that scientists and doctors, who are far smarter than you and I, say they work.</p>

        <p>You have to realise something. The people who participate in this subreddit are mostly mentally ill or just downright dumb. They’re the least reasonable people imaginable, and trying to reason with them is practically impossible . Apart from the countless deaths covid has resulted in, this pandemic was revealed the true idiots of society, which would be anti-maskers, antivaxxers, and globalist conspiracy theorists. Basically the demographic of this subreddit. Continuing to engage with these people will prove to be a huge waste of time and energy.</p>

        <p>Bruh, easiest way to debunk your sick  obsession with COVID would be to simply look at 10y yearly total death statistics. It has a trend to go up each year as there's more people, and death rate of 2020 is even less than what it was 10y ago. So go hide in your basement forever dude, let the normal ones live:) peace</p>
