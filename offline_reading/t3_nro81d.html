        <p>The mortality rate of children increased by 6% last year due to sars-cov-2.  Saying none is not the same as some.  Also this does not include those harmed by the virus.   So far, in the US only children 12 and up can be administered Pfizer and that was just dropped from 16 a few weeks ago after clinical trials showed low side effects.   Moderna and J&amp;J are still only 18 and up until clinical trials data for review arrives. </p>
<p>Also even if no children had Covid or suffered any ill effects from the virus, they can still spread it.</p>

        <p>I believe you are referring to the results of 1,541 children in Saxony, Germany that showed low numbers of antibodies.  That doesn't say exactly what you want it to say.  First, Saxony has had low infection rates compared to the rest of Germany which says things like masking, social distancing, lockdowns work.  Schools in Germany were locked down until late Feb/Early March and have required masks and social distancing in school (and they are actually doing it).  Second, we've seen that blood-borne antibodies don't last that long in people. </p>
<p>If it helps, it does appear that children are less likely to transmit than adults, but that not the same as don't.</p>

        <p>Old hobbies do sound nice. All of this ending will be nice too. The thing is, if a few, or just "some" children can get it, and have a bad response, though statistically don't, and if people in mild health under a certain age are also fine, would it not stand to reason that only those in high risk, and only those that are sick should get the vaccine, as you still get and spread it even after, this whole thing starts to feel more like a circus. I'm all for protecting people, helping people, and saving lives, but we as a species have way more dangerous killers than covid, and this whole "pandemic" feels way over played. Also, if it is so contagious, it would also stand to reason that damn near everybody has been exposed by now unless they have been living off grid and had no contact with anything since 2019. Quarantine should be for sick people, and those who have been around sick people, those who are so at risk that they have real rational fear. If this were for a second about health and saving lives, and not about money and control, we would as a race be pushing healthy diets, exercise, avoidance of processed fatty foods and all kinds of shit to prevent cancer, obesity, diabetes, and a whole myriad of other mostly preventable life ending diseases.</p>

        <p>So the problem is that we don’t know exactly who will be okay and who won’t.  Also vaccines are not 100% (these are pretty good though).  Vaccines work best through herd immunity.  Also there are individuals who can’t  have or won’t response to the vaccines so they need to be protected by those of us who can.   Also reinfection is a definite problem as resistance won’t last forever (and there is no guarantee that if you’re okay the first time, you will okay the next time).  A steady vaccination program can help remove this risk by maintaining resistance.     </p>
<p>I’m not sure that we have more dangerous killers at present (at least in the US before the vaccine rollout).  Covid was the third largest cause of death in the US behind cancer and heart disease last year.  This was with all the precautions taken.  No telling if we had had nothing to address it.   If want you the pandemic and all the restrictions over, vaccines provide the quickest route.   Numbers have already dropped to March 2020 levels.  We’re almost there and most restrictions are over.  </p>
<p>It’s unclear how many people have been exposed to the virus.  Initially estimates were asymptomatic was 80% of the cases, but more recent data suggests just 17% of cases were asymptomatic.  This would drastically cut the estimated number of infections.  Also it is unclear how long resistance is good for.  Some coronavirus can reinfect yearly.  The blood borne antibodies start dropping rapidly after 100 days.</p>

        <p>I gotta be honest here, pretty much none of this is true besides the risk if heart disease and cancer being a major problem. Eat healthy, exercise, and you'll be fine. The data is twisted and fucked back and forth, paid for and manipulated, and constantly contradicts itself, and no, it is not because "we're just learning as we go".</p>

        <p>It’s called math and is based on numbers from the CDC last year.  If 517 kids (0-18) die per million typically and then 30 kids die per million from Covid that is 30/517 * 100 =  5.8%.  This means an increase of 6%.  </p>
<p>Asymptotic spread isn’t happening, really?
Latest information I could find says 59% of transmissions are due to asymptotic cases. http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35057</p>
<p>If you like here’s a mix of good/bad news.  Turns out that only 17% of infections are asymptotic (as opposed to symptomatic and just pre-symptomatic) instead of the as high as 80% that was figured early on.  So that reduces the number of potentially infected people (Good, fewer transmissions).  Of course, it also means that fewer people have had it meaning more people are still susceptible without the vaccine (Bad).  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3</p>
<p>Look over 60% of the US population has had at least one dose of a vaccine.  Case rate and death rate are dropping like a rock.  Everything is reopening and mandates are lifting.   We are almost there.  Just get the shot so we can put this pandemic in the past.</p>

        <p>&rt; Asymptotic spread isn’t happening, really? Latest information I could find says 59% of transmissions are due to asymptotic cases.</p>
<p>That's a model. It's basically meaningless. Actual empirical studies by CDC do not observe any asymptomatic spread https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/4/20-4576_article</p>
<p>&rt; We observed no transmission from asymptomatic case-patients</p>

        <p>Read the study closer.  It's of just 53 patients (6 patients they couldn't get a hold of), in the early days of the pandemic (March 2020) based on phone screenings where they asked questioned and relied on patient recall.  It would be more surprising if they did find asymptomatic spread as they weren't doing widespread testing at that point.  Say person A and C are symptomatic.  If Person C says yeah, I was around person A for 30 minutes two weeks+ before my symptoms.   They would claim that person A infected person C.  However, they didn't know about person B who was asymptomatic and was the true source point for person C.   Person B had contracted it from person A, and then person B had spent several hours with Person C a week ago.  As long as they could connect one pre or symptomatic to another within a sufficient time frame they wouldn't see an asymptomatic person as the vector. Make sense?   Read the conclusions, they make light of this and other limitations.</p>

        <p>&rt; The fact that we did not detect any laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 transmission from asymptomatic case-patients is in line with multiple studies (9–11). </p>
<p>Ah, yes, when scientists make light of something, they usually say that their findings fall in line with multiple other studies.</p>
<p>&rt; Read the conclusions</p>
<p>This one?</p>
<p>&rt; In conclusion, our study suggests that asymptomatic cases are unlikely to contribute substantially to the spread of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <p>I had three cousins get COVID (2 serious) that was probably contracted through their church.  They started attending the church 3 times a week during the pandemic.  Two people died (known) where I work (don’t know the number of infected).  I had several neighbors also contract Covid (symptomatic of varying degrees), and one person had to have part of her foot amputated because of blood clots due to Covid.  We have lost between 600,000 to 900,000 people due to this virus in the US and many more have been affected to varying degrees.   All of this was with these restrictions in place. How much worse would it have been had nothing been done?    So I do believe we have looked at it rationally.  </p>
<p>Look at the attached graph that shows the weekly death count by year in the US from all causes for 2015-2020.  Notice how much the red line (2020) sticks out?   This is with death from things like accidents, suicide, flu, all being lower than previous years.   </p>

        <p>And I STILL maintain that people should get to assess risk for themselves without shutting everything down, forcing people into poverty. My cousin's son died of a drug overdose, because his school shut down and so did his activities. My husband's cousin (who has two young boys) is dying of cancer that was perfectly treatable had routine cancer scans not been cancelled. Want me to go on? LIFE is a risk, and each person takes that risk every day they get up. Why am I wasting my breath? People like you will never see the other side of this.

One of the reasons I like this subreddit is because it seems to be one of the few remaining places on the Internet wherein people can actually discuss the issues openly and frankly. I know we're considered conspiracy theorists, but I thought I'd offer my appreciation to you for bringing stats and ideas that are typically not expressed here, at least as far as I can tell. I hope you're treated with respect in this convo</p>

        <p>Part of the problem is they make the same debunked claims.   People get tired of that.   Discussions are important and necessary but when people continually make the same claims without evidence, they get downvoted or banned.   Also I’ve seen people on this subreddit say “I was just asking a simple question and I got banned”.   I backtracked several of these users and found their posts.  They weren’t “just asking a simple question”.</p>

        <p>Because 1) People are bad at assessing risk 2) Their personal choices affect others.   We live in a society so personal freedom has to always be weighed against what’s best for society.   It’s a delicate balancing act.   You might be low risk for Covid, but you are still a carrier.  As the number of infected people go up in an area so does the chances of transmitting the virus to others.  So I might do everything I can to avoid being infected (wearing a mask, sanitizing my hands, being distance and only making essential runs (and there are plenty of people who had to be out daily for medical, children, or work), but if I’m surrounded by infected people then my chances of contracting the virus still go up.</p>

        <p>Seriously, you don’t know of other times?  This is a no-brainer.  The Spanish Flu of 1918-19.  The US did many of the same measures as now.  Public gatherings were banned.  Restaurants, schools, churches, theaters, etc were all closed.  Social distancing and masks were mandated and in some places people were ticketed for violations.   Venues were changed to outdoors like now.    Like then, there were people who fought against the measures with similar arguments as now (some were verbatim). There were 3 primary waves (a small 4th wave in some areas). Each subsequent wave started when areas loosened restrictions.    Why do you think epidemiologists spoke with such conviction?  We have literally seen all this before.  Somehow despite all of these restrictions when the finally virus faded, everything went back to normal.  </p>
<p>If your opinion can’t be changed, then that illustrates your opinion is not based on reason, but emotional conviction. You have allowed your opinion to become part of your personal identity.  </p>

        <p>Easy. In times of crisis, people look for leadership.  When this started, we had weak political leadership that many people didn’t trust.   Dr. Fauci came across to many as authentic, genuine and trustworthy.  He had years of experience as director of NIAID and working in the NIH. He’s well respected as an immunologist within the field.  Despite the political climate, Fauci did a pretty good job of navigating the waters and providing information to the public.   It was natural for people to look towards him.  </p>

        <p>Well, that's one way to change the subject. You do realize that Dr. Fauci and epidemiologists don't set state and local policy, right?  The CDC and NIH work as advisors and assist states when needed.  You should look at your local leadership and ask them that question.  </p>
<p>The BLM protests weren't the only protests allowed.  Anti-Covid measure protests happened as well around the same time.  Banning protests is more difficult than shutting down, limiting capacity, and operating hours of businesses and events.  The "right of the people peaceably to assemble" is guaranteed under the first amendment.  You have to have governors or the President/Congress using marital law and other draconian measures or the President using the Insurrection Act for that.  It's a much higher and more problematic hurdle.  </p>
<p>As for Fauci and many other epidemiologists, they expressed concern over the protests [1][2]. There were some epidemiologists who were supportive of the protests.  There were key differences with protests: They were outside, somewhat spaced out, and in the case of the BLM protests wore masks.  Ultimately, the BLM protests weren't associated with a rise in cases; in fact, cases in those areas went down due to more people staying home [3]. </p>

        <p>Starting at 1:31:</p>
<p>"Can you provide any investigative leads to researchers trying to discover WHY early outpatient therapies for Covid-19 have been suppressed?"</p>
<p>"I'd look very carefully at the work building upon other investigative reporters. Dr. Peter Breggin has a book called 'Covid19 The Global Predators We Are The Prey'. It has a living document he's already pre-released the manuscript and he's releasing updates now he's older he's kinda worried the story won't get out at his age. I believe he's already up to 900 documents. The whole story's not put together but it is substantial and shows the interconnections of the stakeholders involved.  Dr. Nicholas Wade who was featured on a recent Tucker Carlson is an investigative reporter. He has assembled quite a story. And then Whitney Webb who's a young investigative reporter has published some striking things. All three of these as well as many more are linking two important concepts:</p>
<p><em>The suppression of early treatment and even probably the soft attenuation of in-hospital treatment to make the problem worse than what it is. Many methods to make the case count look higher than what it is. Make the mortality numbers look worse than what they are. Many methods to create the reaction out of proportion to the reality so lockdowns, fears, economic suffering, what have you. All of these things making the pandemic way worse than what it is. To have that occur. More fear, suffering, hospitalization and death, loneliness, lockdown.</em> </p>
<p><strong><em>In order to promote mass vaccination.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>These two are tightly linked. Now mass vaccination AT ALL COSTS.</em> </p>
<p>The world 'must' be mass-vaccinated, and human beings on earth ought to understand that at this point in time what we're seeing is unprecedented. It became known the virus was going to be amenable to a vaccine somewhere around April-May. At that point in time therapy was suppressed. Nothing could be published. The fake Lancet paper squashed treatment. And then prepare the population for vaccination. </p>
<p>Once the vaccines come out they're short-tracked. There's all kinds of enthusiasm regarding it. You know, needles in all the arms. Trucks rolling. Americans cheering. And then the mass vaccination program starts off. </p>
<p>And then before we know it we're vaccinating pregnant women. Why are we doing that? That can't be safe! Now we're going to vaccinate covid recovered patients. Wait a minute! They have complete and robust permanent immunity! No one's ever challenged the immunity of the covid recovered patient, why are we vaccinating them? And then it keeps going and going. At first we vaccinated high risk people I didn't really understand vaccinating young health care workers because they weren't at risk. There were never any hospital outbreaks in the United States. The only thing that was clear was that nursing home workers gave it to nursing home patients. We knew that. So nursing home workers should have been vaccinated. And then maybe high risk people and we should call it a day. I always estimated maybe 20 million people need to be vaccinatedd but that didn't seem to satisfy the vaccine stakeholders.</p>
<p>Which are: Pfizer, Moderna, J and J,  Astra-Zeneca and any others that come forward, the CDC, the FDA and the NIH. And the White House. Massive vaccine stakeholders. You could throw in Gates Foundation, World Health Organization you can throw those in as well. Massive stakeholders and they wanted everybody to be vaccinated without exception. No one will escape the needle. We've never had this before."</p>
<p>Lots of explosive stuff after that too- really worth a listen!</p>

        <p>Why is everyone so worried about this vaccine, if you are concerned with safety, just read the results of the long term studies they did.</p>
<p>Oh dang, I just looked for them, it appears they somehow released a drug to the public with no long term studies.  Well this is a first. </p>
<p>Sounds safe to me, go get your shot, I'll wait thank you.</p>

        <p>Sure, look at how many Guillain-Barré syndrome cases they claimed happened to shutdown the swine flu vaccine in the 70s.  I believe the pharmaceutical industry sponsored number is 4, the actual number is likely thousands.  Even with 4, it was enough to shutdown the entire program.</p>

        <p>But guess what, you take that risk by going out. You ALWAYS risk that. And like I tell my kids: who can you control? Yourself. Not sure why that's so hard to understand. I'd never even try to restrict others so I'd feel safe. That's none of my damn business. I have the choice to go out or stay inside, and I take responsibility for that decision. Your problem is that you think it's your right to control others ....it's not. And the more you try to shame people like me, the more we resist. Just sayin'</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, in Illinois we're seeing cases of Covid 19 drop precipitously every week even as we open up our economy because people are getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>You all can trust this one doctor and think everyone else is just making stuff up / all in on some grand conspiracy but the facts say otherwise.  </p>
<p>Covid 19 is real, it presents a real risk to our health, and the vaccines help us to fight it.</p>

        <p>What's weird, is that even without people getting vaccinated, other places that opened up also dropped. Also, they stopped counting tests (if we can even call them that) for people who <em>got the jab</em>, as many were showing positive, despite dropping test cycles suspiciously for them, which I'm sure lowered numbers too, also on top of a point of time where the great majority have already long been exposed.  Seems like everywhere they started opening things up, and people started getting more active, numbers starting dropping.</p>
