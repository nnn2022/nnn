But did they really got sick due to covid or due to the vaccine?</p>

        <p>Still taking it back to the beginning of the year when no one was vaccinated to dilute the numbers , lets see some week on week or month on month stats</p>
<p>and lets see how many died within two weeks of the vaccination as they are not counted as vaccinated</p>

        <p>"only" 2.3% of the total deaths were from fully vaccinated since January 1st. This article doesn't really tell you anything, how many people were fully vaccinated when most of the deaths occurred in January-February 5%? 10%? and if we are to listen to the experts that it takes several weeks after you are fully vaccinated until you will ha a good immune response. I agree that this is just diluting the numbers and way too early to tell you how effective the vaccine is. Lets see the following weeks, and months what the % of deaths from fully vaccinated really are.</p>

        <p>Random question, do you happen to have a source that shows that China provided the sequencing used to create the covid shots for the US?</p>
<p>I thought this was a thing that happened but I don’t have a source for this and I don’t know if maybe I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>“At the heart of the controversy lies the fact that <strong>the creators of the most commonly used test, the RT-PCR, published instructions for how to test for SARS-CoV-2 “without having virus material available,” in their own words, relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet.”</strong></p>
<p>“I reached one of the authors, Dr. Kevin Corbett, at his home in London. He spoke simply and with controlled apoplexy. He confirmed and cast additional light on the shocking fact that the paper was written in the absence of a viral isolate, among many other problems.</p>
<p>“Every scientific rationale for the development of that test has been totally destroyed by this paper. It’s like Hiroshima/Nagasaki to the Covid test,” he said. <strong>“When Drosten developed the test, China hadn’t given them a viral isolate. They developed the test from a sequence in a gene bank. Do you see? China gave them a genetic sequence with no corresponding viral isolate. They had a code, but no body for the code. No viral morphology.”</strong>

<p>“The first and major issue is that the novel Coronavirus <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong> (in the publication named 2019-nCoV and in February 2020 named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of virus experts) <strong>is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in China [1], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic RNA of the virus was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 viruses or full length RNA thereof.”</strong></p>
<p>External peer review of the RTPCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2 reveals 10 major scientific flaws at the molecular and methodological level: consequences for false positive results.
https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</p>
<p>Dr. Tom Cowan states:</p>
<p>“However, it turns out <strong>these photos are actually NOT corona viruses, and the CDC, among others, has known this fact since at least 2004.</strong> The above paper examines the evidence used to claim that these images represent viruses, rather than <strong>normal “structures” within a cell, particularly sick cells.</strong> Here is what the paper says:</p>
<p><strong>“We have observed morphologically indistinguishable inclusions within podocytes and tubular epithelial cells both in patients negative for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as in renal biopsies from the pre-COVID-19 era” (emphasis added).</strong></p>
<p>In other words, the <strong>researchers saw these same structures in people with no evidence of Covid</strong> and in samples they took <strong>before Covid</strong> even happened, before the virus was said to even exist. </p>
<p>In addition, they say:</p>
<p>“We postulated that <strong>endogenous mimickers could be present that are morphologically indistinguishable from SARS-CoV-2 virions ultrastructurally.”</strong></p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>“Viral-like inclusions, consisting both of single vesicles with diameters between 50 and 138 nm, as well as packed groups within larger vesicles, were found in all 15 cases, either in podocytes. Tubular epithelia, or vascular epithelial cells (figure 1).”</p>
<p>In all 15 cases that they examined, they found structures identical to what is being called SARS-CoV-2.  They were scattered all over the kidneys and blood vessels; <strong>they are not viruses, but normal parts of the cells.”</strong></p>
<p>“But the final nail comes in this quote:</p>
<p>“The <strong>potential for confusion of coronavirus particles with normal cellular components was in fact highlighted in a detailed ultrastructural study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of SARS-CoV responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p>In other words, the CDC in 2004 knew that <strong>researchers couldn’t reliably know these particles were coronavirus particles. Not a word has been heard about this since.</strong> All virologists use these pictures as proof of the existence of this virus. <strong>It is a fraud, based on junk science, like everything else connected with “Covid 19.”</strong>

        <p>Interesting that a scientist at Moderna received a call from Davos (World Economic Forum) by Moderna’s CEO telling him to start working on a “vaccine”.</p>
<p>“It is true that Moderna’s mRNA vaccine was ready remarkably fast, as was Pfizer’s.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese scientists put the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus online on Jan. 11. Over the next two days, the NIH and Moderna used it to plot out a vaccine.</strong></p>
<p>Afeyan remembers getting a key call about the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. “January 21st, my daughter’s birthday.... <strong>I got a call from Davos [during The World Economic Forum] from the CEO of Moderna,”</strong> he says. Bancel had been approached by a number of public health groups at the conference “urging” him to work on a vaccine.”</p>
