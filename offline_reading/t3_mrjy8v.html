<title>China sterilised &gt;3M Uyghur women - most of whom did not understand what was being done to them - for the noble causes of eugenics and depopulation. It's a good thing that the same government had a 'Come to Jesus' moment and now wants to save human lives so that they can PROCREATE EVEN MORE.</title>
