    <strong>"Stop questioning science!"</strong>
    <p><p>Their behavior has become almost cult-like. Their faces express disgust, contempt and loathing. Their misery begs for company and to hear you won't partake makes them feel envious - and foolish. But they are completely disarmed of facts to make a reasoned appeal to logic. All they spew is obvious propaganda which omits, distorts and misrepresents fictions as facts. They cry out in unison, "Stop questioning science!" as if blissfully unaware of the useful idiots they've become. This is the New Normal - science has become a religion and all who question it will be dealt with swiftly and without apology.</p></p>

        <p>What's scaring me more lately, and this might be a uniquely Canadian problem, is the far lefties that seem to dominate the Canadian subs that almost seem to know there is more going on than a 'public health crisis'.  I get the sense they understand this is being used as a guise for reshaping society and more than happy to go with the fake tears and fear mongering of public health officials.  Could be bots/plants.</p>

        <p>The one I'm really tired of is 'You should work a day in an ICU nurse's shoes!'  You mean work a day in the shoes of someone who chose a line of work where you see a lot of medical distress and death?  Unless covid is overwhelming the ICUs this is not an argument.  We didn't shut down to prevent people from getting ill we did it to prevent the ICUs from being overwhelmed.  If they're not overwhelmed, stories about sick people dying from covid don't move me.  People die all the time.</p>

        <p>Science is hands down the best religion so far, I just think that the problem is that anyone can introduce themselves as experts. People with high theoretical education without experience of real field work don't seem to have much sense of reality. The most intelligent human I have ever met is a low educated construction worker, and easily the dumbest one has a doctors degree. A computer modeling of aerosols when sneezing doesn't tell anything about masks working in a crowded subway for example. Just waiting for the first expert to tell that we have to destroy Amazon because modeling tells us it now emits co2 more than absorbs.</p>

        <p>This is true. Blindly following research is dangerous. But until the opposite side provides more evidence than the evidence that supports current regulations, they will continue to think that way.</p>
<p>If 10% of the evidence says A is true but 90% of the evidence says B is true, then most of the people will follow what B says. Only the people with an agenda against B will follow what A says, because logically, you should follow what is more correct. This is why the CDC still recommends to wear a mask even though there are a few studies that suggest wearing a mask doesn't prevent the spread of coronavirus; there are still far more studies supporting wearing a mask.</p>
<p>The cool thing about science is that things change when the 10% in A grows larger. But currently, research supporting the idea that masks/social distancing don't work are still at a low percent, so nothing will change.</p>

        <p>It's not science I have a problem with, it's the people involved that I don't trust. Science on it's own doesn't have the ability to pay people, threaten people, offer high level government positions (rachel levine), on it's own. There's always people involved and those people have agendas.</p>
