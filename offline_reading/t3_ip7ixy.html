        <p>I agree with you on that, more people is worse for the planet. But I'm a population doomer - I think the population will just increase to the point that combined with climate change, there will simply not be enough food to feed everyone and people will die off. That will be a pretty bad time, because people dying of starvation will resort to desperate measures. But I expect it would happen long after I'm dead, not within 50 years. More like 200+ years.</p>
<p>And of course it will be gradual not instant, and affect the 3rd world much worse at first.</p>

        <p>I get your viewpoint.</p>
<p>I'm saying 50 years because we are already having problems with the weather, and it's only going to get worse. When the weather is messed up enough, lots of plants are going to start dieing, which is only going to compound the problem. Once it starts going, it's not going to stop. So I'm not saying we're all going to be dead in 50 years, but their might be food shortages or something similar</p>

        <p>By the way, no one here disputes that covid exists (as far as I can tell). </p>
<p>As for how bad it is, I draw my conclusions from the available data - you could do the same if you were so inclined. If you have evidence that supports that it is “worse than we think,” I strongly encourage you to share it. We like facts and science here, we’ll pay attention. </p>
<p>We are also generally aware of the fact that the rest of reality does not get put on pause simply because covid exists. We believe in minimizing harm from all causes: covid, starvation, missed cancer screenings, untreated strokes, depression, missed education, ruined small businesses, domestic violence, etc. Most of us are of the opinion that all of the other harms that result directly from lockdowns are collectively far worse than the harms caused by covid. Of course you may draw a different conclusion, but I hope that you do so with consideration of the bigger picture - ignoring the harm inflicted on many, many millions of people by lockdowns is cruel and myopic.</p>

        <p>So few people think the whole thing is a hoax. Some do, but most acknowledge that the disease is real and does kill people. Most people that claim its a hoax aren't really referring to the disease itself being fake, rather the reaction to it. </p>
<p>Most here do probably believe it's not as bad as it has been advertised. But this is hardly a controversial idea. Pretty much all the data we have shows this. The CDC itself pegs the IFR at around 0.2% to 0.6%, with the caveat that its deadliness is heavily age stratified. The reality is that Sars-cov-2 is not deadly for people younger than 65, and fairly deadly for those older than 65, especially if they have serious underlying health conditions. </p>
<p>Do you think that people are anti mask because they find them inconvenient? People tend to be against masks for multiple reasons, and very few people object to them because they are inconvenient. It has much more to do with the fact that the science behind the effectiveness of masks is extremely flimsy. And at this point the real world numbers that we have from places that have implemented mask mandates don't support the idea that masks have any significant impact on slowing the spread of the disease. If you look at California, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Illinois, and many other states, that have implemented mask mandates, you will see that their implementation did not slow the spread of the disease at all. And the same thing has happened all over the world in places like Spain, France, Japan, Belgium, etc. The actual numbers do not support the idea that mask usage slows the spread of the disease. And with weak science and  numbers that don't support mask effectiveness, people take issue with governments forcing people to wear masks based on such weak evidence. </p>
<p>I don't think you are giving people that view things differently than you enough credit.</p>
<p>What makes you believe that the disease is so bad? </p>
<p>Why are you convinced that masks work?</p>

        <p>Well. At least you're not anti mask, and I get your point of view. </p>
<p>The thing is, is that if people don't wear masks when they're living their lives, it's going to get to the point that you will be killing people for just not wearing it. Preventative action is always easier and more effective than reactive action</p>

        <p>The thing is masks do not remove the risk altogether. I think they help. On the flip side, Not wearing a mask while doing something does not mean you’re automatically going to kill someone. Is there risk? Yes. People have the right to asses their own risk and live their lives accordingly.</p>

        <p>&rt; Ban me, I don’t care, it doesn’t mean I’m wrong</p>
<p>I know it’s trendy of late to ban people for disagreeing with the popular view, but I’ve yet to see anyone removed or banned from these subs for voicing disagreement. </p>
<p>Our position is based on pretty solid evidence, and we (mostly) are interested in facts - the mere existence of opposing views doesn’t push us into a mental crisis. If you have good evidence to support your views, share it. But unsupported claims like “you’re killing people” won’t have much effect on anyone.</p>

        <p>The sad part is that nobody will ever sue for this for the same reason your CDC instructs businesses to not refuse service to those who refuse the Face-Diaper:  They don't want legal proceedings where discovery will prove that there is zero basis for any of the hysteria that TV has hyped.  Subpoenaed blood bank data from October 2019 will show that the cold virus "detected" by Christen Drosten's test was "rampant" way before the local spectacles were directed such as what whistleblowers document in NYC.</p>
<p>If you were to be so unselfish as to put laziness aside for a moment and listen to the courageous nurses on the ground at the "epicenter" in April, you might want to reflect critically:</p>
