    <strong>Is it possible China are not lying at all?</strong>
    <p><p>Here me out. </p>
<p>When you send your DNA to various companies around the world to see your genetic history- your data and results may (will) be shared to possible third parties e.g. China. </p>
<p>China have already been accused of amassing a database of minority groups- possibly in order to segregate them when they are able to. </p>

<p>With the growing suspicion of a lab leak, is it possible the virus had actually been altered/weoponized to primarily affect the west/certain races? </p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, we saw indications of how Covid-19 has a higher death rate among people of colour- and as the virus has spread over the past year data is indicating Western countries are much MUCH harder hit by it than Asian countries.</p>

<p>Is it possible China aren't lying about their case numbers at all? What If the virus was altered to avoid them from the start? </p>
<p>From what I've gathered- every virus in history had a verifiable starting point e.g. rat transmitted virus to human via waste.. </p>
<p>Yet... over a year on- we still have not found the natural source of the covid outbreak- further pushing the fact that It did in fact come from a lab whether intentional or not. </p>
<p>I welcome someone to prove me wrong and call me an idiot, its just a thought I had.</p></p>

        <p>I live in multicultural urban Canada.</p>
<p>In terms of covid i only know of people who were lightly ill or asymptomatic (all races)</p>
<p>With the vax itâ€™s almost all white people having severe injuries</p>

        <p>&rt;With the growing suspicion of a lab leak</p>
<p>There's no suspicion, it's been confirmed. China may deny it to save face, but it was a lab leak.</p>
<p>&rt;is it possible the virus had actually been altered/weoponized to primarily affect the west/certain races?</p>
<p>I mean, that sort of thing is likely possible with the help of gain of function research, engineering, etc. but there's no confirmation one way or the other it was designed to target specific races.</p>
<p>&rt;At the start of the pandemic, we saw indications of how Covid-19 has a higher death rate among people of colour</p>
<p>That has to do more with vitamin D deficiency. People with darker skin absorb less vitamin D than lighter skinned people and those who live closer to the equator get more vitamin D as they are closer to the sun and thus get more vitamin D from the sun while darker skinned individuals living further up north get less vitamin D from the sun and would need to supplement. Lighter skinned individuals absorb vitamin D more easily and as such, don't have as much vitamin D deficiency when living up north. Studies were done on those dying from covid and something like 86% had vitamin D deficiency. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33260798/">Link</a></p>
<p>China will lie, deceive and manipulate every chance they get. It's what communists do. I think their low case numbers come from low testing. They know it's nothing to be worried about so they can make it seem like they are doing so much better than the rest of the world by doing exactly what it is that we are not doing: stop testing non-symptomatic people and dial down the PCR test at a normal cycle rate.</p>
<p>Another thing to look into is that those with a specific neanderthal gene are found to experience more severe symptoms with covid while those with a different specific neanderthal gene have the opposite effect. <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/neanderthal-genes-may-influence-covid-19-severity">Link</a>.</p>

        <p>There seems to have been a coronavirus about 20,000 years ago that gives Asians protection against COVID-19. Itâ€™s doubtful Chinese scientists would have known about that two years ago, though.</p>
