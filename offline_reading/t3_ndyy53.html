    <strong>Burbank CA government meeting during covid. They are trying to shut down a restaurant that will not comply with lockdowns. The guy said Rosa parks had to be punished for breaking the law. Wtf? Around the 4hr16min mark in the video.</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.dailywire.com/news/rosa-parks-actually-had-to-sit-in-jail-after-she-was-taken-off-the-bus-burbank-city-council-member-compares-legal-battle-with-local-restaurant-to-civil-rights-icon-in-bizarre-rant</p>
<p>As referenced by the original Daily Wire report, “the city of Burbank has been going after Tin Horn Flats for months after bureaucrats realized the restaurant was allegedly not abiding by the city’s COVID-19 mandates last December.” </p>
<p>During a “special meeting” held by the Burbank City Council on February 22, the hyperbolic nature of these efforts were put on full display when Council Member Konstantine Anthony rejected Tin Horn Flats’ argument by comparing them to Rosa Parks, saying that “Rosa Parks actually had to sit in jail after she was taken off the bus.”</p>
<p>“The idea that the health of this and the science is debatable, and simply because there’s a debate we can throw out all of these orders, that is ludicrous. That is not the way you run society, or government. You do the best you can, you get the smartest people in the room, you take a democratic vote and you pass laws and ordinances,” Anthony said soon after the 4:16:00 mark in the recording of the meeting.</p>
<p>“And if they’re wrong, they get changed, and if they’re unconstitutional they get thrown out in court. But you take them as they come, and you follow the law as it is.”</p>
<p>“You know, Rosa Parks actually had to sit in jail after she was taken off the bus. She did her time!” he said, after a brief pause. He then appeared to immediately undermine his own argument.</p>
<p>“I mean, granted she changed the law. The courts came down and ruled in her favor, but she still had to pay the penance by violating a lawful order, at the time. It was a lawful order at the time. So we have to look at the time and the dates that we have before us. The violations were done at the time when there was a lawful order in place. Not before, not after, but during. If it changes down the line, that’s a different conversation.”</p></p>

        <p>So where do these fucking outspoken Marxists live? Not advocating violence by any means, but stop standing in front of Tinhorn and go stand in front of these asshole council members' houses, peacefully obviously. At the same time, there's a reason they want everyone here disarmed. Easier to beat you for calmly protesting the "wrong" things.</p>
