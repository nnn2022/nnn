    <strong>Something about trump we need to acknowledge...</strong>
    <p><p>Trump is just as guilty for pushing vaccines and covid tyranny as biden is.</p>
<p>Trump could've fired fauci as soon as facui advocated for this shit </p>
<p>Trump could've pushed to reduce CDC power and used executive orders to fight these "mandates" </p>
<p>Trump sold his supporters out during January 6th when people were rightfully angry about all the BS we're facing RN </p>
<p>Trump could've passed legislation against vaccine and mask mandates </p>
<p>Trump could've refused the vaccine outright rather than faking getting it</p>
<p>And most of all, Trump could've not helped push and develop the vaccines in the first place. Operation warp speed was his plan, not bidens. </p>
<p>I'm not saying yall are wrong for believing him, but we need to acknowledge Trump could've done a lot more to protect and save us than he really did. Just sayin...</p></p>

        <p>I think he was banking on winning the election instituting his purge at the start of his second term. There were rumors he planned on yeeting out a lot of people in high places so he had to play along or else there would be a torrent of single issue covid voters that would swing a fair election. Little did he know, he wouldn’t be getting a fair election.</p>

        <p>Anybody who believes Trump was going to have a "purge" at the beginning of his second term must have also believed him in 2015-16 when he said he'd dramatically increase infrastructure spending in the US.</p>
<p>Trump was probably controlled opposition to make anybody opposed to the Deep State look bad. Yeah, a billionaire opposed to the Deep State- I can't believe anybody fell for that BS.</p>

        <p>I agree with a lot of what you said...</p>
<p>However. </p>
<p>Even though I thought they had an absolute hard on for vax passports I never thought the population would be so easily manipulated to support them. </p>
<p>Never in my wildest dreams did I actually believe they would do this. </p>
<p>He said they would be optional. </p>
<p>Why would he put laws in place when even the media was calling that a conspiracy and zero people were advocating for it. </p>
<p>That's the only thing I want to point out. Everything else is on point.</p>

        <p>I hear u friend. But Trump should've at least taken some predictive action. Idk something. If we could've suspected vaccine passports were coming mid 2020, he could've seen it coming November last year.</p>

        <p>the way i see it: warpspeed was a trap for greedy big-pharma, it sped up the process by 2 years, reading great reset and EU plans, it's clear that lockdowns were planned to last till 2023, then rollout "safe" vaxx, but they got lured into vaxx-race, also made russians to desperately launch sputnik :D</p>

        <p>I was in no way a supporter of Trump. Didn't vote for him either time. Was glad when his presidency was over.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I had to change my political views. Because of that, I had to reevaluate Trump's presidency. </p>
<p>While I think he's a flawed man and don't agree with everything hi did or said, I think over all, he had Americas best interest.</p>
<p>Things I couldn't wrap my head around were how he turned on all of our traditional allies. The Paris Agreement, his position on Globalization during Davos. </p>
<p>These are all things I just thought he was bat shit crazy for.</p>
<p>Now, look at things. Our allies are tyrannical. Look at Canada, France, Australia, and other places around the world. During Davos, Trump tried to remove America from this agenda. Stated we could be allies and participate, but not at the cost of Americans liberties. </p>
<p>Regarding the vaccine, trump tried pushing alternative medications and was clearly told to shut up by his advisers/experts/professionals. Go back and watch the briefings he gave.</p>
<p>Trump was in over his head and got played. </p>
<p>The current environment makes me look back at all the drama and attacks on MSM, that I ate up, wondering now how much of it was just to discredit and completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>I couldn't watch Fox news. I primarily watched CNN. Earlier this year, CNN stopped making sense to me. With the BS the Dems are doing now, I imagine they were scrambling and causing as much chaos as possible during the Trump admin, as he was actively disassembling their foundation of the Global Agenda. </p>
<p>So, whether Covid is/was intentional or not, it really doesn't matter, it was a situation that was politically exploited, and the Democrats won that game.</p>
<p>Something to remember is, regardless of someone's profession, they're only people. Doctors, Police, Military, Therapist, whatever. They're all people with their own emotions, own goals. </p>
<p>Anybody can be slandered, anybody can be propped up.</p>

        <p>Dude...I resonate with what you said so much and completely agree. I felt/feel the exact same way. Had the same realizations, used to think CNN was real news and now I'm utterly disgusted by them (don't trust ANY form of mainstream media now, they're all garbage run by conglomerates who just want ratings/money), etc. Was not a fan of Trump, but now can't stand Biden.</p>

        <p>This is Monday morning QB stuff….</p>
<p>It was an election year for one. Any of those moves would have sealed his fate for a lot of his older, more centrist base. Remember this was all about a year ago, when people were clamoring (not all of us but lots) for a vaccine. I think had he gotten re-elected, we wouldn’t be in the shape we’re in now. He would have gone right at DiBlasio for the NYC vaccination mandates. He supported Texas and Florida being “open”…he wouldn’t have pushed for a national mask mandate. He would have fired Fauci as soon as he won the election bc he would have been secure in his 2nd term. He obviously didn’t handle the early phases of Covid very well, especially with some of his comments like “it’s gonna go away and disappear “and things like that so he had to do something (Warp Speed)…who could have known how bad it would get under Biden and his spineless leadership?? Well I don’t disagree with some of the things you say, a lot of this is 20/20 hindsight. Trump was really in a no-win situation, because no matter what he did the media would bash it, and he was trying to win an election. What’s sadly ironic is all the anti-Trumpers saying “He’S LiTeRALLy HiTLeR!!” when the current administration is much more tyrannical and Orwellian. It’s also hilarious, some of those video compilations more people say they would refuse a Trump vaccine, and now they’re all too eager to promote it and push it.</p>

<p>LOL no way. Trump was NEVER going to win that second term and he probably knew it. </p>
<p>Fauci isn’t even the problem, he’s a front man. Firing fauci would solve zilch.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you are highlighting this as it has perplexed me for quite a while. Back in 2020 when the daily task force press conferences were going and Trump would be speaking I would always be thinking "does he not know that a massive part of his so called base probably wants nothing to do with this ~~vaccine~~ experimental biological agent?"  </p>
<p>And to that point -  how about all these other politicians and media personalities that constantly encourage getting it but don't quite fully commit to acknowledging what is totally obvious. It certainly doesn't work as promised - its dangerous - and all the data points are manipulated or outright false. </p>
<p>The impression I was left with (as I try to make sense of it) is that they know the real truth but are afraid to speak it and that they are only willing to go to a certain point with what they say and do. They play this game of tip toe where they nip at the edges while not crossing into the anti-vax zone where they could be fully accused of it.</p>
<p>If the above is true then I conclude Trump's game was: <em>I'm only going along this vax shit to placate these fuckers while leaving an out in the name of choice for everyone else</em>. But his re-election did not happen so... game over.</p>

        <p>Trump only gained the attention of patriots because he made two claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>The news is fake</li>
<li>The deep state is real</li>
</ol>
<p>Patriots understood both claims to be true long before Trump threw his hat in the ring. Had he not said these things, no one would have given him the time of day. Although both claims are true, he did nothing to address either issue.</p>
<p>Instead he used these truths to gain the people's trust and then went right on serving his masters at Davos. The CARES Act is an abomonitation.</p>

        <p>what's with this subreddit and TDS? as a non american, i can't see any connection to it now. Was Trump mandating the vaxx? Was he arguing about it? I mean first time I've heard of Hidroxy, it was from him. First time I though smth is not right here, was because of his speeches and arguing about masks and other ways to cure stuff. At the same time in EU it went like "shut it down", "muricans are stoopid because Trump", "we know better, there is no other medication for this deadly v" and so on...</p>

        <p>&rt;I'm not saying yall are wrong for believing him, but we need to acknowledge Trump could've done a lot more to protect and save us than he really did. Just sayin...</p>
<p>Preface: I voted for him both times, but it's undeniable that Trump failed to deliver on the things he promised - plain and simple. He had the opportunity to drain the swamp and didn't because he wanted to get reelected. He could have set term limits, changed insurance laws, adjusted the minimum wage - he could have really helped change some things. He just held these these things out in front of us like carrots towards the end for reelection. In the end all he did was give them more power and ammunition and dipped like a ghost in the night. He failed us, and I will never forget that.</p>

        <p>Trump and the few people who weren't traitors were busy trying to keep the 2020 election legal and block what the Democrats did with millions of illegal votes mostly through mail-in voting. All his possible legislation against forcing a vaccine and vaccine passports wouldn't have mattered if he lost, as we now can see. Also he is far from a medical expert, he couldn't have known that the vaccines weren't good in the first months of them being discussed. Stop looking at this in hindsight, try looking at this from when it happened and realize there was a ton of stuff going on behind the scenes.</p>

        <p>That's right.  No one is going to save us.
In fact most of us want everyone else gone. </p>
<p>Except of course, those that need others around to prop themselves up or feed upon.</p>

<p>Lockdowns enabled last minute changes to voting laws which were the sole reason hundreds of thousands of fraudulent mail-in votes could be counted for Biden.</p>
