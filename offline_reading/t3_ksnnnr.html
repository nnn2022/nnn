        <p>Couldn't possibly be due to fear mongering and scaring the shit out of people who think theyre gonna die if they catch a cold, so they get hysterical and go to the hospital. Of course they get admitted to ICU because its a pandemic after all. Fuck these people and their lying ass statistics</p>

        <p>That isn't even slightly true. The ITU numbers are variably defined but there has been a massive expansion in NIV  and optflow requirements,  which are often done in a level 2/3 setting.</p>
<p>People's fear does not make them suddenly need ITU. That's not how any of this works, we actively try to hold off ITU as much as possible,  hell the majority of patients we admit are ward based celling of care. </p>
<p>Do you know anything about medical and hospital care?</p>

        <p>"requirements" - this is my contention. As much as the media likes to present as such, doctors don't know everything - they make mistakes. Doctors especially don't know things about novel diseases, thus their reaction to corona followed what they had been told by the media and China - that people had been collapsing in the street and others were dead within a few days. What followed (and continues to) is the overuse of intensive care, as doctors reverted to severe measures for what they believed to be a severe disease. This leads often to the worsening of a patient's condition, and even sometimes death.</p>

<p>They don't need to. We are managing organ failure,  which is not really COVID specific. If they can't come off 15L on a NRBM, then you trial optifow, when that fails you try CPAP, after that I+V.  That is standard. </p>
<p>Ventilation,  which is what you are talking about,  is now done much less and only in extremis. They are not the only people needing ITU. </p>
<p>I stress once again how little you know about inpatient care</p>

        <p>Nice try again dressing this up in your lab coat-speak, but this fails to address my point. There is no requirement for assistance of breathing for as many Covid patients as there were in hospitals; doctors should have been sending these people home rather than using preventative methods on supposedly 'at risk' patients, which combined with all the other effects of being in these hospitals worsened their conditions.</p>

<p>You make an assertion with no evidence at all,  no personal experience and not even the barest understanding of medicine or medical care. So yes, saying how the fuck would you know is a reasonable question. </p>

        <p>Are we just going to make this a 'no you prove it' argument? Surely as the know-it-all medical professional you might have something better than that? Also "Evidence" and "personal experience" are not interchangeable terms; don't rely on anecdotes to support your refutation if you want to bring up words like "evidence".</p>

        <p>I suspect it is not provable to you regardless. </p>
<p>There is no data on the exact requirements of every ITU admission.  Its an increased patient volume and rapidly changing,  by definition they are too unstable for standard beds and require more invasive monitoring or care. They are hugely expensive and require far more nursing,  expanding bed base is very challenging </p>
<p>Anecdote is still evidence,  especially if from multiple people in multiple hospitals. It is the lowest form of evidence,  but still is.</p>
<p>This isn't a refutation as you have yet to make anything other than a baseless claim, there is nothing to refute.</p>
