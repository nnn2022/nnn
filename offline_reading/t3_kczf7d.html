Walking around in the street seeing all the retards with their face nappies, where I am is going back into a bother lockdown. My mental health is getting worse and worse by the day, my career is in tatters and my youth is being stolen from me and all I feel is just sadness and anger I'm just fucking sick of it man.</p></p>

        <p>I need to reclaim my own life back...Starting with these masks<br>
- I will have a mask on when I walk into a store (so I am not immediately turned away)<br>
- Take the mask off when inside the store, while shopping<br>
- Put mask on when going up to pay<br>
- If I am asked to put my mask on by another shopper - I ignore them completely<br>
- If I am asked to put my mask on by an employee - I leave the store   </p>
<p>(I commented this on another post, but relevant here too)</p>

        <p>It really does depend on location but here in the UK I have worn mine about 3 time since the pandemic began. It is illegal to ask someone to provide proof for medical exemption here as it violates the data protection act because your asking someone to disclose their medical history. I never wear mine and have only had a few encounters with assholes telling me to wear them but I just get out my inhaler and tell them I'm exempt.</p>

        <p>People are way too worried about what other people are doing. Not everybody is going to have the same perspective on this and it’s pointless to try and get 350 million people all going the same direction. My advice for anyone is worry about YOU. Do what YOU feel is best for your situation. I wear my mask because it’s not a battle worth fighting at the moment. Even if it only reduces my odds of getting sick by 5% it’s worth it. Social distancing isn’t always practical but it’s not a bad idea. Lots of sick smelly people out there....not a bad idea to keep some distance. As for lockdowns and stuff being canceled and whatnot. We’ve all been impacted to some degree. I’m using crippling depression to make me so numb I’ve stopped caring. I work to pay my debts and that’s about it. I hold faith this is for a good reason and we will come out the other side better off. Beyond that I don’t give two fucks what anybody else does. I worry about what I can control. I see people with masks. I see them with them pulled down. I see them not wearing them at all. None of it matters.</p>

        <p>Hey man I'm real sorry to hear about all that. Honestly I am. I still wear a mask because my city has a pretty decent amount of old people and thankfully my state is not locked down to very hard to begin with so I consider that a decent compromise. But others aren't nearly as lucky as I am in that department. You're right this needs to let up. We did the hard lockdown and if didn't help. You're not the only one suffering in this pressure cooker. So man I just wanted to say I'm sorry to hear your troubles. Stay positive best you can, I know I'll try too.</p>
