    <strong>Alright, I want to hear from the liberals on this sub.</strong>
    <p><p>Prove the trolls wrong.</p>
<p>This isn’t a partisan sub, nor is it restricted to Americans.  We know this.  But just to drive home the point, post your past or present political ideology...</p></p>

        <p>I'm a liberal registered Democrat.
I consider both sides of every argument and come to my own conclusions. I know that's no longer allowed but here I am.</p>
<p>I am not anti-vaccine. I was not "vaccine hesitant" I just hadn't got around to it yet when I found this sub.</p>
<p>My first post in this sub was to shit-talk somebody.</p>
<p>I disagreed with somebody in this sub and I got banned from other subs for doing so. Not because I disagreed, but because I posted here at all.</p>
<p>That surprised me. Censorship keeps people from hearing both sides of the argument. If one side is right about what they are saying why would they need to censor the other side? </p>
<p>I am now very reluctant to get the injection, not because of what the "anti-vaxxers" are saying, but based on the actions of the pro-vax crowd.</p>

        <p>A great take. This is how people should be on every topic, but everything now is so divisive. </p>
<p>I think once you realise how much the narrative is being controlled, you can't take anything they say about the situation seriously. They're literally blocking public knowledge of so many important issues about the virus and the vaccines yet still expect everyone to do as they're told.</p>

        <p>Speaking as an old white male, i was liberal as a young man but became conservative as i aged.  Liberal and Socialist ideas simply aren’t sustainable without resorting to Communist-style authoritarian tactics.  No sane person will act against their own personal interests regardless of how altruistic the promised outcome.    That said, clearly there are a lot of insane people in the world.</p>

        <p>Yep, the problem with a vanguard party that shows people the right way is that it’s never clear when the direction is no longer needed. It’s why a lot of leftist policies lead to totalitarian societies. That said, freedom (that is the freedom to be stupid) isn’t any more sustainable. You have totalitarianism on the one end and Hobbes’ Leviathan wrecking small independent sovereigns on the other.</p>

I love to see liberals/and Democrats , defend the indefensible.

        <p>Bernie fan, voted for Obama twice. I used to call myself liberal, not so much anymore. I'm against people being forced to do anything, even if I think it's dumb. You want an abortion, that's your choice. You want a vax, that's your choice. You want to eat shitty food and die early from heart disease, again your choice. If I don't want something like a vax, that is MY choice and it pisses me off people are trying to make us do things to our bodies we don't want to do. The current regime in the US needs voted out, because all they want to do is control everyone. For what they call the greater good.</p>

<p>if it makes you feel any better, you're probably more of a liberal than the majority of "liberals" today. I think everyone needs a refresher on what liberalism is....it's sad.</p>
<p>I guess I'm considered a "classical liberal," now, given everything that's happened to the left over the past few decades, but I registered myself as an independent at the end of 2020.</p>

        <p>I used to think of myself as a liberal long ago, but was always skeptical of politicians, and became even more skeptical during the Clinton years.  I confess to having voted for Obama in 2008, but it soon became apparent that I was being misled and lied to by that charlatan, especially when he gave a free pass to the corrupt banksters.  So I ended up contributing time and money to Bernie's 2016 campaign as a kind of nose-thumbing to the Dems.  The lying and cheating the Dems did that year confirmed my skepticism about their intentions, and Bernie's complete lack of pushback after he got shafted felt like a betrayal.</p>
<p>Now I find myself more aligned with people on the right in regard to the defining issue of our time, namely the tyranny exemplified at its worst by the government's response to the "pandemic".  I feel completely homeless, politically speaking, and am convinced that the only way out of this mess is to stop paying attention to partisan politics, and instead recognize our common ground across the political spectrum.</p>

        <p>I’m 1.88 towards the right on economics and 1.49 towards libertarian on social issues…. According to political compass.</p>
<p>So fairly moderate but slightly libertarian leaning.</p>
<p>Voted for Gary Johnson in 2012.  Didn’t vote in 2016 or 2020 cuz the candidates were shit.  </p>
<p>Became completely disinfatuated with politics when Hillary and Trump became the 2016 candidates.</p>
<p>Unbelievable that trump/Clinton/Biden was the best we could do.  </p>
<p>Never liked trump, and don’t watch Fox News.</p>

        <p>i am fully against the vaccine becoming "mandatory" or being made nearly impossible to live without. it violates human rights and bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>i also will happily address you by your preferred pronouns and validate your gender. </p>
<p>i also think healthcare should be free in my country. no one should have to die from being poor when billionaires exist. </p>
<p>i also think religion should be kept out of politics. i am a christian, but not everyone is or wants to be.</p>
<p>i also think the summers are getting hotter every year, and humans are responsible for the rapid deterioration in our air quality.</p>

        <p>UK here.</p>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea what I am any more. I am merely a layman, and these days it seems that the left is the right, the right is the left, and the centre can be anywhere inbetween the two extremes!</p>
<p>I have historically voted for the conservative party as I have most often seen them as more economically responsible than the labour party, the most viable alternative.</p>
<p>It isn't as easy to summarise, but instead of nailing my flag to the mast of a particular party or political idealogy, I just try and set out some of my opinions on the more 'hot' topics and let others place me on the political spectrum as they see fit!</p>
<p>As regards COVID, I would classify myself as centrist on the issue, although my impression is in the UK I am seen as hard-right bordering on 'conspiracy theorist'. My positions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is certainly a virus / pandemic.</li>
<li>It is likely, I believe, on the balance of probability to have been a 'leak' from the research institute in Wuhan.</li>
<li>The release of the virus was not planned i.e. it was not purposefully introduced into the public. There is no solid evidence of any Bill Gates/five G/lizard overlord plot to control the world.</li>
<li>That said, governments all over the world are using this as a guise to push top-down authoritarian measures onto their citizens, which are disproportionate to the risk posed by the disease. Examples being 'enforced business closures' and vaccine passports, pushed by Macron and now being snuck in by the backdoor here in the UK.</li>
<li>Wearing a mask, based on a common sense approach alone, is likely to reduce the spread of any diseases spread via droplets. However, the frilly gaping single-ply disposable masks used by the population at large in the UK will do very little, if anything, to prevent the spread of the disease. At this stage, where the majority of the population (and largely all those vunerable to severe illness) have recieved their vaccine, the mask is as much a symbol of subservance and virtue than it is an effective tool against cutting down the spread of infection.</li>
<li>Vaccinations are generally a very positive practice and have saved countless lives across the years, although as with any medical procedure one needs to assess their own risk and be ultimately responsible for their own health.</li>
<li>Forced vaccination in order to access certain facilities (pubs, nightclubs, sports arena's, concerts etc.) is a breach of human rights. One is born with the rights to patronise these places and fundamentally one should not have to undergo a medical procedure in order to 'opt in' to certain societal privileges.</li>
<li>I am not personally satisified that the vaccines as they stand have enough long term real world data to convince me (young male, no respiratory conditions pre-existing) to have the vaccine. No matter the level of funding, I do not believe it is possible can do 10 years of research adequately in 1 year. I understand that the technology behind the MRNA has been researched at length before, but I am incredibly hesitant as this is the first time it has been deployed en-masse.</li>
<li>To a very limited degree, we are all responsible for the health of the general public. To give an example, I don't think that it would be acceptable for me to drive the wrong way down a motorway, or to tip my businesses waste materials in the local drinking water reservior. That said, the individual is ultimately responsible for their own health and I cannot therefore be held infinately responsible for preventing others catching COVID. I am frustrated particularly whereby people who will willingly smoke, take recreational drugs, drink copious amounts of alcohol and have poor diets, berate me for posing a risk to their health. I am also frustrated when larger corporates, that regularly pollute the environment, avoid taxes and national obligations, produce 'sin' products (like tobacco etc) push vaccine mandates onto their employee's or use vaccines in their marketing campaigns - see the recent Heineken adverts for one example.</li>
<li>I believe that in the UK, the 'selfish' position is to clamour for repeated lockdowns and similar measures, not to decide not to recieve the vaccine largely for other's sake. I believe the mental and physical health damages caused by the lockdowns (not COVID itself) have been grossly underreported in our national and mainstream media.</li>
<li>
<p>Following on from 10, I am very unhappy about the manner is which the government has awarded grants and COVID support payments to individuals and businesses. As an accountant, I have seen countless examples of wealthy commercial property owners gleefully taking the £10,000 rates grant, whilst individuals that work more hand-to-mouth get nothing or at best, very little. It is highly inequitable and I am not happy that as someone who worked throughout the pandemic, I am going to be responsible for paying back debt that we have been saddled with so that neighbours could stay at home for months and have BBQ's in the sun. Labour and Conservatives have failed to correctly fund the NHS for years, to the point where it has become an ineffecient organisation filled with beaurocracy and middle management and almost unfit for purpose.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whilst I believe in Public Healthcare, to me there is cognitive dissonance in the way the government treats the NHS. We were encouraged to 'clap to the sky' for months on end in support of the NHS. At it's height, the NHS became effectively a quasi-religion. Now we find that the government is in a pay dispute with many NHS workers. The doctors and nurses at hospitals, from personal experience, are great people. However, for a long time GP's have become 'gatekeepers' to the NHS. Getting a face-to-face appointoment has been nigh on impossible for years prior to the pandemic. The organisation needs to be overhauled if we want a socialised healthcare system that is sustainable in the future.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAGE are un elected body who hold disproportionate power over the decisions of government. They are comprised of as many behavourial psycologists as disease experts, and I believe are politicised. See - Susan Michie, a member of the UK communist party who is a clinical psychologist. SAGE's predicitions, particularly those by Mr Neil Ferguson, have been shown time and time to be at best wildly inaccurate and have at each step over-estimated the severity of the pandemic dramatically.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suppression of any counter narrative and any lack of debate on the COVID issue has been discraceful. By ignoring the many mass protests around the world, in London in particular, the BBC/SKY/ITV have become untrusted in my eyes. Reddit, Facebook, Instagram are all acting of the arbiters of morality and science all of a sudden and I feel it is big tech overreach. I would be very interested in watching a government scientist debate someone like Mr Vernon Coleman for example. If these people or 'vectors or misinformation' are spreading such plainly incorrect information, surely it would be a simple case of one televised or streamed debate where the public could watch the 'misinformation' pusher squirm.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have quite a lot of other points, but I need some shut eye after work. It has been helpful just to vent today. All the best chaps and chapesses. I would be really pleased if anyone has any comments on this - even if you disagree with my opinions on the matter!</p>

Anyway, that's what I am...its not <em>that</em> uncommon in Europe and the UK and no thanks I don't want to answer to yet another bunch of political theorists explainining why I <em>cannot possibly exist</em> when I am pretty certain that I DO exist.</p>

        <p>Voted Democratic from Kerry to Obama, some mild voter suppression stopped me from voting Hilary (probably for the best, honestly), and I have stopped participating in the charade at this point and would like mostly to be left alone. 
Theoretically, I would classify myself as anarchist. Practically, I would align with the Democratic socialists and Libertarians, depending on the issue.</p>

        <p>My politics: equalise to the best degree possible  basic freedoms as far as health, food, education, shelter (I don't believe this is at the exspense of others if managed correctly).</p>
<p>Any notion of hierarchy must be justifiable under a high level of scrutiny relative to responsibilities. This would mean extremely cautious and mathematical based protocols to be applied specifically onto those tasked with said hierarchy (not regular citizens).</p>
<p>I believe all publicly funded services besides the basics should be opt-in by each individual/family. Those that contribute get to use said service along with total transparency as far as where their funds are spent.</p>
<p>Most of the functions of government today can be replaced by Blockchain smart contracts (with total privacy, transparency, etc). Also there could be 1000s of types of "currency" (similar to bartering), the key difference being they're all exchangeable with each other elemimating the known issues of the past system if trading goods.</p>
<p>In summary, I think an intelligent yet simple economy with privacy and complete control for everyone as a bare minimum. Those that want to work towards a more luxurious lifestyle are also no prohibited, aslong as it's not limiting others from the basics they need. Those that want to live in a cave can go ahead.</p>
