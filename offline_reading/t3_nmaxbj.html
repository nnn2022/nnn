    <strong>Moderators: why you don’t ban covidiots from this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>Literally anywhere else you go and say ANYTHING that is slightly against the narrative you will get massively downvoted and most likely banned. This way I got banned from a freaking comic sub by saying the comic calling anti-maskers is stupid, although WHO have changed the statement multiple times and yes, officially, in countries like Germany you must have a specific sort of mask and can’t just wear any clothed one. </p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter. There are clearly people who get lost and end up here. No matter what arguments and statements we give them they keep fighting, repetitively saying the same ass-brainwashed-monologue I see on other subs. </p>
<p>Why you just don’t ban them? There’s no use of having covidiots here. If a doomer still has this mindset  after over a year they WILL NOT CHANGE. Those people are MENTALLY ILL and need a THERAPY. There’s no way sane person would ever justify the authoritarian dystopia we ended up in. </p>
<p>Please, just ban them. Report them. I’m tired of arguing and they just waste a space.</p></p>

        <p>We are not the party of censorship.  Let the others be the party of censorship.</p>
<p>We can win debates, they cannot, which is why they have to shut down all dialogue which goes against their narrative. </p>
<p>The others, the real Nazis, the real Stalinists, claim that speach is "harmful" (to them), or that it's "misinformation" (in terms of their propaganda), and so they have to shut it down.  If people are able to point out their lies and their agendas they will lose power.</p>

        <p>In fact, creating echo-chambers where only "vetted" or "trusted" speach is allowed is a huge part of the Party of Censorship's ability to maintain power.</p>
<p>This is why universities create "safe-spaces" where only certain types of thought are allowed, and it's why you're not truly allowed to debate your professors in class, at least not without fear of punishment or your grades suffering.</p>
<p>It's why social media bans and shadow-bans anyone who goes against the narrative.  </p>
<p>It's why so-called "journalists" ask weak questions when speaking to Biden or Psaki or Fauci. </p>
<p>It's why the media outlets bring out fake "experts" to parrot bland and established talking-points.</p>

        <p>Some do come here and manage rational discourse, and any willing to have intelligent conversation should be not just allowed but encouraged.  Many who are here and disagree with lockdowns and masks didn't always think this way, they had to be lead here.  This path needs to continue to be open.</p>
<p>Some will never agree, but as long as they're being civil, we should continue to talk to them, and listen to them.</p>

        <p>This is the way. Enforcing basic rules about being civil and not spamming can work well enough to separate the good opponents from the bad, because people with a different viewpoint coming in good faith will usually behave, and the trolls won't.</p>

        <p>I thought that someone would say that and I understand the point, however, no covidiot will ever think “hmmm this sub is so nice, gives a freedom of speech to everyone 🥰”. There’s no gratitude and they perceive all of us as “bad guys” and their mission is to repetitively say the same bullshit that they say anywhere else. I don’t think it should be accepted as it’s the only place of a common sense and it’s exceptionally a lot of them here.</p>

<p>If they want to ban and censor me, fine, I'll go elsewhere.  If they want to come into our land to talk, learn, and engage.....who knows, maybe we'll get a few converts who finally get it now that they've left THEIR echo chamber that only had one voice.</p>

        <p>Freedom of speech is a point of principle. Doesn't matter whether they're grateful for it. Freedom of speech is here to stay whether they like that or not (they don't)</p>
<p>Moreover, the tide is beginning to turn. People are getting banned from their own subs for benignly posting about vaccine side effects. Concerned women are being purged from social media for talking about interruptions to their menstrual cycles. Those people will find their way here, some already have. When they do, I for one want them to find a place where they will not be censored. It's not just critical thinking where covid is concerned that we have to encourage. We need to draw people's attention to the dangers and effects of censorship in general. This is the only way we can hope to improve society.</p>

        <p>All fair points, but as a matter of principle I couldn't agree with banning.</p>
<p>If they're doing stuff that should legit get them the Hammer, sure. But if they're only being obnoxious just block them, and suggest to others to do the same.</p>
<p>Once they've been ignored long enough they'll either move on or start to change their tune. They won't want to, but when they realize that nobody is even reading their posts/comments, they'll realize they really only have two options </p>
<p>And if they don't it won't matter, because they'll just keep getting ignored.</p>

        <p>Disclaimer: Not a mod</p>
<p>I don't think they should be banned. If we're truly against censorship, we should act like it. I'm not afraid of seeing perspectives that differ from mine. Nobody should be. That's the point.</p>
<p>Let those other subs be echo chambers if they want, we can't control that. But we can control what <strong>we</strong> do. We should show that we're not afraid of disagreement like they are. We aren't looking to silence people, nor are we looking to create a false appearance of consensus like them. Even on CovidVaccinated, dedicated Branch Covidian NPCs are being banned and having their posts removed for simply talking about side effects. This is wrong, and we should not mirror this behavior.</p>
<p>Censorship is wrong. By all means ban spammers (like people from /r/AgainstHateSubreddits who have spammed Nazi shit here before) or people who post illegal content trying to get us shut down. Anything else, so long as it's on topic, should be allowed.</p>

        <p>Is there anyway we can compromise this? I agree, banning isn't the option but also agree that these post are quite annoying. I've found a lot of great sources here and I'd hate for them to get to get lost in the mix of the covidiot posts. Can we maybe make a rule about the "genuinely curious"/"serious question" posts asking us why we think the way we do? Maybe we can put like a "read/see these sources before asking those kinds of questions" or something like that? Idk lol. Again, not advocating for banning but almost forcing them to do their own research before posting could help?</p>

        <p>If they come here, they never come here to change minds. It’s a very optimistic and naive way to think, come on, do you really think that someone after a year of this circus will change mind because “idiots” from Reddit told him so? Any argument bounces back just like they were walls. I think I have hope lost way more than most people here lol</p>

        <p>honestly .. banning them prevents others from seeing how dumb their ideas are .. it allows us to express our views and opinions in opposition to theirs .. which allows us to bury them .. plus outright banning anyone for their position or ideas is Orwellian .. let's not become them .. rather let's become better than them</p>

        <p>Free speech is free speech. Banning people for voicing their opinion is wrong no matter how stupid their opinion is. They are like little Chihuahuas, terribly annoying and yappy but completely harmless.</p>

        <p>The thing is we don't know who really is curious and who is a troll/shill.</p>
<p>We likely can't convince the troll/shill, but we stand a chance with the curious.
And whoever we convince will be voting this fall either with their wallet or ballot. If we want more people on our side to resist it then we need to convince them.</p>
<p>In Ontario there was a massive demonstration and less than a week later the premier announced plans to open up.
In Nova Scotia there was a small demonstration and was mocked everywhere. Then the government announced an extension of the lockdown.</p>
<p>Don't feed the trolls. Don't pay the shills wages.
With warmth grace and facts bring the undecided over. Offer them cookies!</p>
<p>They are the ones who will decide how NNN will be treated when the next COVID wave hits. I want them on our side.</p>
