    <strong>There is still hope</strong>
    <p><p>I went to an inside water park located outside of the city. They were closed since march last year and finally were allowed to open last month. There were rumours that unvaxxed people were not allowed to enter. I looked them up on Facebook and I couldn't find this anywhere. I told all of my friends to go there and they told me "dude, they won't let you in, you're not vaccinated for God's sake".</p>
<p>A few of them are vaccinated, others aren't (thanks to me for that). I told them it's not the case and they kept telling me you had to be vaccinated to go there and to any swimming pool. Well now I am there with a friend, the employees don't even wear masks and the only thing we had to do was answer six questions if we got in contact with someone confirmed with Covid, if we have any symptoms, etc. But nothing else. Everyone here has a great time and I love it. It's like Covid doesn't even exist (it doesn't, but that's another story). Now all of them envy me cause I'm there.</p>
<p>I'm really happy these guys here are normal and reasonable, gives me hope.</p></p>

        <p>that's great!  here in Ontario we are waiting for our OUTDOOR water parks to finally reopen (tomorrow is actually the big day).  masks still required while you are waiting to get in, getting food, indoors, going to the restroom, etc.  While the mandatory masking sucks, it will be nice to get out again and so glad they aren't making people wear masks outdoors like Canada's Wonderland - not sure who would go there under those conditions!</p>

        <p>Dude is a draconian bastard. He started off with temporary measures, and since he could get away with it - no checks , balances or review, the time constantly got extended 'antoher 2 weeks' then 4 then 6 then completely indefinite with himself on the Throne, making the final decision.<br>
WTF happened to Canada dude, this is crazy. He needs to go. all Provincial leaders do</p>

        <p>Yukon is very nice, between BC to the Yukon, we get every kind of terrain imaginable.. from snowy capped mountains to desert to tundra to rain forest to boreal forest - natural hot springs, glaciers..</p>
<p>but even there the Premiere is a freaking nutcase, making restrictions over the province for '1 party' which he claims has risen cases, etc.</p>
<p>I swear all our leaders have gone rogue in Canada and turned into dictators.</p>

        <p>No one wants to say this is political, but I'll guarantee you the stark differences between one business or pool or rec centre and another seems to be on political lines (after mandates are lifted) </p>
<p>A more conservative business will allow you in, and another Leftist business will be mask and vax only.</p>
