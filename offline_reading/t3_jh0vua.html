    <strong>The Utter Insanity of thinking that lockdowns will make the "pandemic" end sooner</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen many doomers suggest that lockdowns (and masks) will make the "pandemic" be over SOONER. Where this idea comes from I have no idea, but it can't be grounded in any kind of reputable epidemiology. </p>
<p>Lockdowns and masks do the exact opposite. They make the pandemic last LONGER, by spreading cases out over a longer period. </p>
<p>Everyone here already knows this obviously. But I hate all of the gaslighting, and wanted to point out yet another example.</p></p>

        <p>Herd immunity isn't about getting infected on purpose. No serious epidemiologist is advocating for that. </p>
<p>It's about letting the virus infect those who are least at risk of complications, and shielding those who are most at risk. </p>
<p>The virus will end due to herd immunity either way, whether or not we get a vaccine. A vaccine helps specifically BECAUSE it accelerates herd immunity. We basically have 2 choices:</p>
<p>a) we lockdown everyone until a vaccine, which is uncertain, and not guaranteed. This prolongs the pandemic and puts the 70 year old immune compromised grocery store worker who can't stay home at risk. There is also a lot of collateral damage using this strategy: suicides, domestic violence, drug overdoses, delayed vaccinations in the developing world </p>
<p>b) we shield those who are most vulnerable, and allow the virus to target less vulnerable young adults. We allow people to make their own choices. If healthy young people wish to stay at home, because they do not want to be infected, that is their choice. If elderly people wish to participate in society despite the risks, that is their choice as well. </p>
<p>I don't understand why it is controversial to suggest that b) is better</p>
<p>Honestly, though, I would willingly get infected with SARS-CoV 2 if it meant that 130 million people in the developing world wouldn't starve (which is the amount of people the UN estimates will starve due to the lockdowns)</p>

        <p>I mean scientists literally came up with the strategy of focused protection, and 40,000 of them have signed the Great Barrington Declaration. Just because they are advocating for a strategy you don't like doesn't mean they aren't also experts. </p>
<p>Focused protection is also how experts said we should handle every pandemic before this one: 2009 H1N1, 1968 flu, 1957 flu, even the 1918 Spanish flu didn't have this level of lockdown hysteria.</p>
<p>Also unprecedented: shaming people who happen to spread a virus. I guarantee you've been part of a disease chain of some type of flu that killed someone somewhere at some point. Disease is a part of life, and the idea that we can be disease free is very strange to me. </p>
<p>Science is not a homogenous field. There is disagreement and debate. That's the whole point.   </p>
<p>By the way, in my opinion, the lives of 130 million potentially starving people are more important than my friends and family not getting a relatively wimpy form of the sniffles.</p>

        <p>Interesting that you would bring up my mom. </p>
<p>Do you drive a car? Do you eat meat? Do you buy any goods that are made in factories that produce air pollution? Do you use any polluting chemicals (ex. Cleaners, solvents) in your home? Have you ever lit a fire/candle/barbecue anywhere?</p>
<p>If so, then the carcinogenic pollution attributable to you from any/all of those activities directly contributed to my mom's death of cancer last December. We could stop producing carcinogenic chemical pollutants today. We don't. Why? Because it's inconvenient. Do you want to be held responsible for my mom's death?</p>
<p>Very very few people care or are willing to change their lifestyle even one inch to stop producing these types of chemicals. </p>
<p>Unlike synthetic carcinogenic compounds, which we have control over and which we could stop producing tomorrow if we wished, viruses are something that has been around literally FOREVER. And that humans have been coexisting with since the dawn of time. My own grandmother, who is "high risk" by virtue of being 94 years old, literally could not care less about this pandemic. She grew up in a time where polio and measles were real threats. No social distancing, mandatory masks, or lockdowns during outbreaks of these diseases. Why? Because viral disease is an unfortunate part of human existence. </p>
<p>And again, NO ONE IS SAYING that we should PURPOSEFULLY infect people like a chicken pox party. What they're saying is that a strategy that leaves 130 million people (including CHILDREN) in the developing world to starve in order to save a comparatively minuscule number of octogenarians already on their death beds isn't a good strategy. Or a fair trade off.  </p>
<p>How would you like to be in the same situation as many in the developing world where you (and your family) die of starvation, or tuberculosis (due to delayed vaccinations)? This is the situation that lockdowns are pushing literally millions of people into. The lives of people in the developing world matter too.</p>

<p>What we got was a half hearted,jubled up mess of bull shit.Where majior retailers stayed open and sucked half of the govenments financial relief efforts.It's kinda like those poor people that try to commit suicide,fuck it up and get left with half a face.</p>
<p>Essentially we as a civilization Tryed to commit suicide over something that big picture is insignificant.Now we have half a face.Instead of trying to deal with the problems that led us here and the results of our actions.The people that want another lock down want to put another round in the chamber and try again.</p>

        <p>Exactly. This would only work if literally the whole world locked down at the same time and everybody followed the rules, which is totally unfeasable.</p>

        <p>What pro-lockdowners saying "if everyone followed the rules, this would be over right away" miss as well is that literally no government policy has 100% compliance. It's like saying "if everyone followed the rules and didn't murder anyone, we wouldn't have any murders" or "if everyone drove safely and obeyed traffic regulations, we wouldn't have any car accidents". That would be a fairy tale world, and that's obvious to most people.</p>
<p>If a policy isn't able to be complied with at the level that's required for it to be effective, then it's not a good policy, and should be abandoned.</p>

        <p>Yea,my thought was close borders and enforce with military and martial law.(the reason for the national guard) In retrospet that probobly wouldn't have worked either way....but February was diffrent.I work in the maritime industry so I was following this since the first lockdown in wuhan.It looked like it might completly shut down my industry.If corona was actuly deadly we'd be totaly in a diffrent place.</p>

        <p>Everyone will not die. The virus has a 0.3% fatality rate, heavily skewed towards older people. </p>
<p>Our current lockdown / mask strategy does NOTHING to protect the immune compromised, 70 year old grocery worker. It "protects" privileged, upper middle class, office workers who can do their jobs from home, many of whom are in their 20's. The exact type of people who don't need any protection. </p>
<p>While a vaccine would certainly be helpful, a rushed vaccine that hasn't been properly tested is less than ideal. It depends on the vaccine itself, in the end. But I am cautiously pro-vaccine. That doesn't mean that we should lockdown until a vaccine that may NEVER come.</p>

        <p>The point is to keep capacity at hospitals. If too many people need professional help with covid you will eventually run out of personnel. More people die because they don't get assistance. Restrictions and lockdowns are applied to slow down the spread if it gets out of control. It cannot be fully stopped because some people will travel anyway.  So yeah the point is to delay pandemic</p>

        <p>Because the world works proactively now. They are not overwhelmed at the moment (depends on the country) because restrictions keep them away from getting flooded with covid patients. If cases double each week for longer period and you don't restrict people, then it'll will ruin the healthcare.</p>

        <p>The fact that they can't afford to keep staff on means that if an outbreak of *anything* happens they're now more likely than they were in 2019 to not be able to keep up.  </p>
<p>You can't just snap your fingers and hire a bunch of providers, they need training in the systems used at the site and time to learn how they fit into the care apparatus. You lay off a bunch of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and secondary staff and you send a powerful signal that *those careers aren't good fields to pursue*.  </p>
<p>That's not even touching on the backlog of cancer screenings and other preventative care that's building up because of the overreaction to the Wuhan Coronavirus. Can't be proactive if people can't see a doctor.</p>

        <p>Actually no. I'm not selfish. </p>
<p>I have personally benefitted a lot from the lockdowns. My industry is booming, so I got a new job with a much higher salary and better working conditions. My university classes now have open book online exams, so they're much easier. I prefer a small get together with friends at my house rather than a larger gathering at a restaurant anyway. </p>
<p>Who has not benefited is the 130 million people who the UN estimates will starve because of the economic devastation of the lockdowns, the many people who will die of drug overdose and suicide, and the other untold number of people who will die of delayed medical treatment. For example, 400,000 more people will die of TB due to delayed vaccinations. </p>
<p>While lockdowns have been bad in the developed world, they have been absolutely devastating for developing countries. </p>
<p>Not only that, they have FAILED to protect essential workers WHO ACTUALLY ARE AT RISK. A 70 year old working at a grocery store SHOULD be able to stay home. Same with the immune compromised. Lockdowns do NOTHING for these workers.</p>
<p>Masks provide a false sense of security. They do very little to absolutely nothing to stop the virus. A false sense of security does nothing to help anyone. </p>
<p>And since when do you need to be an expert to have an opinion on something? I bet you aren't an expert but you still have an opinion. Plus, many medical professionals have come out against the current strategy. </p>
<p>If we stopped reporting on case numbers, no one would even know there was a pandemic going around.</p>

        <p>Alright. I'll bite. </p>
<p>New Zealand is a tiny island nation that is using an unsustainable strategy. They can't stay locked down forever, and as soon as they open up to the outside world, the virus will return. </p>
<p>The entire point of lockdowns and masks is to flatten the curve so that healthcare systems aren't overwhelmed. This is from the CDC and WHO. </p>
<p>The point is not to reduce fatalities directly from the pandemic. That will only happen when the virus stops circulating. </p>
<p>I don't think anyone is TRYING to make this last longer. I don't think there's a conspiracy. But I do think that the people saying these things don't realize that the point of lockdowns and masks was never to eradicate the virus.</p>

        <p>If you get that wear a mask. Avoid contact and keep a distance. Or the healthcare will be overwhelmed in the second wave like we managed to avoid this spring. If you keep spouting bs like nothing is going to happen if we ignore the virus. Like trump and the US has done and why we are in this state right now. A lot of people will die. Or will we just let another 200.000 people die because some people become ignorant and dont like that they have to wear a mask for 15 minutes. This isnt about you, this is about the people that can AND WILL  get terminally ill from this. And even if someone isnt vulnerable they may have lost someone so just wearing a mask to show that you care for the pandemic and everyone that has died can make a difference. Grow up</p>

        <p>Can you just objectively look at a couple of facts and not use emotions? Not trying to insult you or anything, just would genuinely like to hear your response.</p>
<p>&rt;BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE FUCKING DEAD</p>
<p>There is a 0.3% chance of dying population wide (skewed toward elderly). The median age of Covid death in the US is 78. The life expectancy in the US is 78.</p>
<p>&rt;You can see that in new zealand where everyone stayed inside for a month and now the pandemic is gone.</p>
<p>New Zealand is an island with 5 million people. The US is a massive country with 328 million people. New Zealand has very low cases right now, but the virus is not gone, it still exists elsewhere and will reintroduce itself to NZ.</p>
<p>Nothing I just said was an opinion or emotional statement. Those are all facts. Viruses don't just disappear entirely even if we lock everyone inside for a month. Lockdowns and shit were aimed at flattening the curve, not eliminating it.</p>
