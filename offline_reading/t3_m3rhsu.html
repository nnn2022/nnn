    <strong>Proof That The Israeli Vaccine Efficacy Study Shows No Effect of the Vaccine Reducing the Severity of COVID</strong>
    <p><p>This is for people who need to talk to family members who believe doctors and the news like they are infallible gods. </p>
<p>The news has lately been waxing poetic about the success of the Pfizer vaccine in Israel. I am assuming they are using Israel as a template for what the rest of the world should look like. </p>
<p>I read the study sometimes touted by the media showing how the vaccine is helping reduce the severity of COVID:  https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7009e3.htm?s_cid=mm7009e3_w </p>
<p>Here is what I ascertained:</p>
<p>They compared the number of &rt;70 year old’s on mechanical ventilators (used as a proxy for a severe COVID case) to the number of &lt;50 year old’s on ventilators. </p>
<p>The reason is that 85% of the &rt;70 year crowd in Israel has received both dosages of the Pfizer vaccine compared to 10% of the &lt;50year population. </p>
<p>They compared the ratio of the rolling average of both populations who were on ventilators and found that the ratio dropped from approx 6:1 to 2:1 from late 2020 to the present, marking a 67% decrease in the ratio of severe cases, which they attribute to the vaccine being rolled out. </p>
<p>But their data on table 2 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7009e3.htm?s_cid=mm7009e3_w#F2_down shows something different. </p>
<p>When you compare the number of 70 year olds on ventilators from before that segment of the population was fully dosed to the number of people over the age of 70 on ventilators after being fully dosed, they stayed the same and even increased. </p>
<p>Then look at the rolling average number of &lt;50 years of age on ventilators and their numbers are also increasing. </p>
<p>Of course these numbers when looked at in context shows that less than 0.0001% of the population of &rt;70’s is actually part of the severe covid case contingent. Also they don’t make mention of other existing medical conditions in said data. </p>
<p>So my conclusion is that the 67% efficacy number really shows nothing as the base population numbers for the &rt;70 age with a severe case after both doses of the vaccine stayed the same or increased. </p>
<p>TL:DR Digging deep into the data shows that the vaccine had no effect on whether someone had a severe reaction to the alleged “SARS-COV-2” virus. The media and the Israeli government is lying.</p></p>

        <p>Interesting. So why even use a ratio in the first place? Shouldn’t it be enough to say that the number of people on ventilators in a highly vaccinated group dropped by a large percent? Oh, except they can’t say that because it didn’t happen. So let’s use a ratio to make the numbers look good in a headline, because most people only read headlines anyway.</p>
<p>(At least that’s what it looks like to me... are there any smart people in here who can explain the discrepancy?)</p>

        <p>You hit the nail on the head. </p>
<p>The absolute numbers of 70+ year olds who were considered as severe COVID cases stayed the same or went up even after being given the 2nd dose. </p>
<p>The number of people &lt;50 years of age on ventilators also went up (still &lt;0.00001% of the population lmao). </p>
<p>Therefore if the denominator goes up but the numerator stays the same/goes up less than the denominator than the ratio is smaller. </p>
<p>Effectively this analysis shows us nothing and gives a nice sound bite.</p>

        <p>&rt;the Israeli government is lying.</p>
<p>The same government that redacted all the specificities of its Faustian bargain with Pfizer-BioNTech AND paid extra for the jabs? THAT Israeli government?</p>
<p>&rt;Also they don’t make mention of other existing medical conditions in said data.</p>

        <p>&rt; They compared the number of &rt;70 year old’s on mechanical ventilators (used as a proxy for a severe COVID case) to the number of &lt;50 year old’s on ventilators. </p>
<p>You got it backwards. They used number of &lt;50 year olds as control (proxy). Few of them were vaccinated, so there should be no change in their susceptibility to the virus, therefore this time series can be used to measure the baseline (how prevalent the virus is).</p>
<p>You can see an increase in &lt;50 year olds (because the virus is spreading), but no corresponding increase among 70 year olds. Vaccine effectiveness  can explain this difference.</p>

        <p>I’m saying they used people on ventilators as a proxy for delineating what a “severe case” is. </p>
<p>When you look at https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7009e3.htm?s_cid=mm7009e3_w#F2_down</p>
<p>The number of 70+ people on ventilators stayed the same or increased on a rolling average basis (approx 100 to 120 out of a population of 750,000). </p>
<p>The point is that the vaccine did nothing to those numbers even after the 2nd dose was applied. </p>
<p>If anything the under 50 numbers started going up from a rolling average of approx 20 to 50 (out of 6.4 million) once the vaccine program was initiated.</p>
