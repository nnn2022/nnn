    <strong>Being a doomer is a mental illness</strong>
    <p><p>Title says it all. The amount of fear these people live in is not healthy. No critical thinking skills to look at the current events logically. Just clouded by pure emotion fueled by another mere person they idolize on a screen. Not only is it a new religion, but a mental illness.</p></p>

        <p>A lot of the people who are doomers use it to validate their existing issues. Hypochondriacs, those with OCD, social phobia, etc would previously be expected to conform to normal society. Now they can get the old normal society to conform to them.</p>
<p>Previously fear or dislike of touch was a mental disorder, now it's justified as social distancing. Previously obsessive cleaning and fear of germs was OCD, now it's expected. This has completely changed society to the point where what we considered mental disorders in 2019 are normal.</p>

        <p>I think you're right. They all seem to be driven by ulterior motives. Is it possible that:</p>
<ol>
<li>People with bad noses like masks because they envy others.</li>
<li>People with few friends like lockdowns for the same reason.</li>
<li>People who hate working like WFH because they don't have to look presentable, or commute, and they can spend half the day on Facebook.</li>
<li>People who don't like visiting family have an excuse to avoid them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I realize it's all anecdotal, but I've observed each of these behaviors among the biggest doomers I know.</p>

        <p>I have definitely seen number 4 A LOT. I have a sibling that already always made excuses to not see our parents for months on end, even though they live in the same town. Now they can just scream"COVID!!!!!!!" and get away with it.</p>

        <p>The biggest advocates of lockdown are the many thousands of people newly inducted into the WFH class.  They don't want to give that up because it's not only quality of life that improves, you earn more from not commuting.</p>

        <p>Another year or so of the masks, the vaccines, the fear, paranoia, pre-existing conditions and most of them will die off like the dodo.</p>
