    <strong>To those who think this groups comments are breaking the law...</strong>
    <p><p>Ok... When you post an opinion you open yourself up to opposing arguments.</p>
<p>Me personally I love a good debate!</p>
<p>However petty remarks that these opinions are breaking the law, are not critical thinking, they are surface level remarks at the best.</p>
<p>Before you make your next response I urge you to step away and think. So that you respond constructively and thus, open up a discussion.</p>
<p>Rather than simply saying ‘you are wrong’ end of.</p>
<p>Just in case you missed it, here is why this group is not breaking the ‘so called law’.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The term "freedom of expression" and includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas. Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right. It states that "everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.</p>
<p>No one has the power to stop a person thinking and no one has the power to stop a person speaking. One voice has the power to connect to another and grow.</p></p>

        <p>Pretty sure the governors have banned the constitution and its amendments, so that argument doesn't fly any more :(  The entire UN has tossed human rights out the window too.</p>
<p>I wonder how long until the party-of-censorship currently in power proposes laws to make it illegal to disagree with the state's version of science.  Government-controlled media and propaganda are really popular with these types, it's much easier than having to rely on real science and facts.  (Hence Newsome refusing to release data, it just gets in the way.)</p>

        <p>‘I shall take my voice wherever there are those who want to hear the melody of freedom’.... no one can ever take away a persons right to speak. They can say it’s unlawful but no one can stop a person thinking or speaking their mind. One persons voice can still connect with others and be heard. Look at how the numbers of this group and groups around the world are slowly but surely growing. Please don’t give up and please keep speaking.</p>

        <p>Just in case you missed it, there are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions">several forms of speech that are not protected under the first amendment </a>, including “speech that incites imminent lawless action,” as well as certain cases of “false statement of fact,” </p>
<p>&rt; The Supreme Court has established a complex framework for determining which types of false statements are unprotected.[14] There are four such areas which the Court has been explicit about. <strong>First, false statements of fact that are said with a "sufficiently culpable mental state" can be subject to civil or criminal liability.[15]</strong> Second, knowingly making a false statement of fact can sometimes be punished. Libel and slander laws fall under this category. <strong>Third, negligently false statements of fact may lead to civil liability in some instances.[16]</strong> Lastly, some implicit statements of fact—<strong>those that have a "false factual connotation"</strong>—can also fall under this exception.[17][18]</p>
<p>this is worthy of mentioning, though I wouldn’t risk my freedom for it,
&rt; There is also a fifth category of analysis. <strong>It is possible that some completely false statements could be entirely free from punishment.</strong> The Supreme Court held in the landmark case New York Times v. Sullivan (1964) that lies about the government may be protected completely.[19] However, this category is not entirely clear, <strong>as the question of whether false historical or medical claims are protected is still disputed.[20]</strong></p>

        <p>You say speech that incites imminent lawless action. Which law would this be, that Is being broken?</p>
<p>Also you mention false statement of facts. Which i find interesting and would be interested in seeing your data and evidence to support this statement. Of those facts which are untrue.   </p>
<p>Also please be aware I am in the UK and hence subjected to different laws and hence your response will need to account for those laws.</p>

        <p>So first, I’m from the US and going off of US laws, not the principal of free speech which is the basis of the law but not an actual law in itself. I am not claiming that anything you said or read falls under these categories, merely showing that the principal is all encompassing but the law has caveats.</p>
<p>As for imminent lawless action, it applies to any federal law (again, in the US). There’s no federal mask law or vaccine enforcement so this isn’t really an issue but there’s been really  organized stunts that get hung up on trespassing charges.</p>
<p>False statement of facts usually applies to false advertising or slander and libel (things that can be demonstrably disproven) but can be applied to anything published (everything you put on the net).</p>
<p>The UK has a lot more exceptions for free speech so you’re up a creek.</p>
<p>&rt; However, there is a broad sweep of exceptions including threatening or abusive words or behaviour intending or likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress or cause a breach of the peace (which has been used to prohibit racist speech targeted at individuals),[2][3][4] sending another any article which is indecent or grossly offensive with an intent to cause distress or anxiety (which has been used to prohibit speech of a racist or anti-religious nature),[5][6][7] incitement,[8] incitement to racial hatred,[9] incitement to religious hatred, incitement to terrorism including encouragement of terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publications,[8][10][11] glorifying terrorism,[12][13] collection or possession of a document or record containing information likely to be of use to a terrorist,[14][15] treason including advocating for the abolition of the monarchy or compassing or imagining the death of the monarch,[16][17][18][19][20] sedition,[17] obscenity,[21] indecency including corruption of public morals and outraging public decency,[22] defamation,[23] prior restraint, restrictions on court reporting including names of victims and evidence and prejudicing or interfering with court proceedings,[24][25] prohibition of post-trial interviews with jurors,[25] time, manner, and place restrictions,[26] harassment, privileged communications, trade secrets, classified material, copyright, patents, military conduct, and limitations on commercial speech such as advertising.</p>
