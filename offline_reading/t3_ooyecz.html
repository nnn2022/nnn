    <strong>NSSP Footnote on a CDC COVID-19 tracker graph is a lesson in crap methodology.</strong>
    <p><p>Dr. John Campbell has a million YT subscribers, because he seems like a grounded person who reduces alarmism. Yet he picks and chooses what he will "analyze".</p>
<p>Here he discusses the US Delta third wave... https://youtu.be/ZxyjyBu9l-E</p>
<p>4:35 Notice how the Y axis title is cut from the frame! Seemed a little red flag.</p>
<p>So I went directly to John's CDC source. A CDC covid data tracker. He had set it to view data for "Trends in ED visits". It's in the viewing menu that isn't alphabetized, and I can only surmise the menu is a cluster-F to deter folks from looking too closely. But if you take your time "Trends in ED visits" is there.
https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits</p>
<p>So apparently the Y axis is the percent of emergency department visits for those "with COVID-19". But if people read the graph's footnotes they would see this Y axis title was defined as covid-19-LIKE symptoms....</p>
<p>Covid - LIKE - SYMPTOMS üò§</p>
<p>He completely ignored the CDC footnote regarding the definition of the "measure" that is capturing "coronavirus" for this graph...</p>
<p>The footnote said "Emergency Department (ED) visits captured through the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) are being used to monitor COVID-19-like illness". </p>
<p>Naturally anyone glancing at this graph and Y Axis Title, would assuming the CDC or ER staff actually verified that these patients in the ER had COVID-19. Instead how are we know when the NSSP is over-reporting any respiratory illness that is covid-like in symptom presentation?</p>
<p>Would you like to know how NSSP defines Syndromic Surveillance when they capture data or how they strengthen inter-rater reliability? Because Inter-rater reliability would be the degree of agreement among independent observers who rate, code, or assess the same phenomenon, and in this case it's "covid-like symptoms in the ER". Yes? You would you like to know their method? </p>
<p>Too bad, this is about as transparent on "consistency" as the NSSP will be. They say they collect "de-identified data including chief complaint, diagnosis codes, patient characteristics, and location to state and local health departments or to data aggregators such as Health Information Exchanges." Go ahead and look at the NSSP's pdf document at their provided link as well to learn more about their surveillance methodology or more about the CDC's BioSense Platform. Only the CDC could get away with calling this reporting bias "sound science".
https://www.cdc.gov/nssp/how-sys.html</p>
<p>Furthermore, if NSSP is gathering "diagnosis codes"... let's say the ER department wants to get some of that financial reimbursement our legislators promised for treating a covid-19 case... How does the ER code for screening covid-19? With the latest American ICD-10-CM billable code  Z11.52
https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/Z00-Z99/Z00-Z13/Z11-/Z11.52</p>
<p>Now please read question number 10 and 11, from this FAQ! It's the March 24th 2021 Frequently Asked Questions Regarding ICD-10-CM Coding for COVID-19 that was shared online by the AHA coding clinic. I'm not allowed to directly copy the text or pdf, as it was written by the American Hospital Association‚Äôs Central Office on ICD-10-CM/PCS. But it can be viewed if you go to the FAQ link yourself and read question number 10 and 11. 
https://www.codingclinicadvisor.com/faqs-icd-10-cm-coding-covid-19</p>
<p>Now you understand why NSSP didn't want to delve into the gritty details behind those "diagnostic codes". Because NSSP exploits reporting biases that are occuring in hospitals that have to use these subjective coding methods to get that corona-money.</p>
<p>I did wonder what the CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) was. Turns out it's a collaboration between CDC federal partners, local and state health departments, and academic and private sector partners who have formed a "community of practice". Want to know more about the community members in the CoP? It lacks specifics right here!  https://nsspcommunityofpractice.org/about-the-nssp-community-of-practice/</p>
<p>I just know my state can't effectively collaborate and track MRSA between hospitals to effectively control the spread, but I imagine NSSP is tax dollars well spent....</p>
<p>Mandated in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002, the CDC BioSense Program was launched in 2003 to establish an integrated national public health surveillance system for early detection and rapid assessment of potential bioterrorism-related illness. But nowadays it can track injuries from wildfires and epidemiology data in general.
https://www.icf.com/clients/health/cdc-biosense-digital-platform-public-health-monitoring</p>
<p>But the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) also said they collect those ER diagnostic codes and store them in cloud through the BioSense Platform.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn more about the platform's quality as a measure... But this published article on BioSense doesn't delve into specifics.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5676506/#__ffn_sectitle
This article does give BioSense a decent review for usability, stating "Certain functions have been used more than others across the various tools to conduct syndromic surveillance, with at least 50% of participants reporting use. These included creating data access rules, viewing and verifying raw and processed data, running time series, conducting free-text queries, and assessing data details and total ER visit counts by hospital, county/region, or state."
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6606091/</p>
<p>Regardless... It doesn't change the fact that BioSence seems to facilitate reporting biases. The CDC is tracking "covid-like symptoms" in ERs with very loosely defined Covid diagnostic codes gathered from ERs by BioSense. I believe the CDC covid tracking graph's Y axis title "Percentage of COVID-19 ER admissions" is incredibly misleading based off the details in the footnote on how this is defined.</p>
<p>John Campbell is a smart fellow. Smart enough to financially gain by appearing to "debunk" some alarmism, while still riding on public fears. So of course he doesn't benefit if he is fair or thorough in analysis, as he hopes his audience won't notice what he is obscuring. They might stop watching! This circus of fear propaganda and departmental reporting bias needs to end. It's not like I can leave a yelp review for the CDC!</p>

        <p>He is disingenuous by what he doesn‚Äôt talk about. Here‚Äôs the thing though: it‚Äôs inevitable that his channel will eventually be deleted by YouTube. He talks too much about ivermectin and vitamin D. He thinks he‚Äôs safe because he‚Äôs also very pro-vaccine and never properly addresses the safety of the vaccines, but his channel will eventually fall foul of the ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù police and it will be a wake up call for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>I doubt he will be deleted. I can see how folks like John Campbell, are the corporate stakeholders sophisticated form of propaganda. He's a shill that they benefit from.</p>
<p>He's an academic and A&amp;E (accident and emergency) nurse. So I KNOW he understands how to critically analyse a design...

        <p>I hope you're right.  Here's another doctor on YT who's pro-vaccine, but dared to even slightly veer off the tight script he was meant to follow:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXeT3TC5tWI - his channel is under a lot of pressure right now.</p>
