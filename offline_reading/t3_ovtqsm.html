    <strong>Ive Lost..</strong>
    <p><p>Ill start by saying I am under 18yrs old. Over 15. Living in Canada.</p>
<p>Well, as the title states, Ive lost the battle.</p>
<p>For so long, I wasnt too keen on just following the sheep of the media, and only giving into the sheep lifestyle of following what the grand governments and corporations tell us to do. How do people continue to trust the same governments and companies that have been lying to us over and over again, aswell as give no regard to the destruction of the Earth? How do we continue trust these powerful ruling entities as if they havent been fucking us over?
Im not necessarily anti-vax, but im also very much a free thinker. I do NOT want  unknown substances or something that  I dont know what the after effects are, injected into me.
Im not worried about microchips or anything “extreme” like that (but I have nothing against those who do believe that) Im more so worried about foreign substance, aswell as untested substance where we dont know the long term effects. People are literally putting their trust into the same things that continue to dictate us with lies, and im not for it. But theyve crossed a line and cornered me and my rights.</p>
<p>They said at first that peace was an option, that if you didnt want vaccines they werent going to force you. Now, every where you look they have these subliminal messages trying so hard to throw you into the sheep herd. Not only that, they threaten you with youre own lifestyle. “No vaccine = no leaving your home, no visits, no sport activities, no going to work, no doing groceries, no going out. The list goes on. 
I was pushed into a corner against my will to get vaccinated, just to have my rights and liberties back. 
Ill admit, Im the selfish one labeled by society because i was never wanting my vaccination in the first place for numerous reasons, but im selfish because regardless of what misery , suffering, and global scale panic the vaccine MAY cause in the future, im giving up my dignity and beliefs in exchange for my rights aswell as a normal life where they havent cornered me with no rights. Theyve won the  battle against me by being scum and taking away the rights of those who have an opinion against this large scale global dictatorship scheme.</p></p>

<p>Fellow BC guy here, I'm not wearing a mask anymore and they can fucking arrest me but there's enough of the population that will not comply. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for Canadians we don't want to offend thy neighbor. But we're soon realizing our neighbor is also fed up with mask mandates and restrictions.</p>

        <p>Please research the requirements for you to become an American citizen. I know it’s only a matter of time for us, but for the sake of your sanity, please consider relocating. I don’t know how you made it this far unless you’re newly awakened. The great rest is upon all of us. Get out while you still can.</p>

        <p>Hold off as long as you possibly can. The vaccine has only been rolling out for ~6 months, even less for youths. If the vaccine is as dangerous as some experts have been suspecting it could be, we’ll start seeing those repercussions soon. Evidence of ADE, for example, is starting gain traction. If/when enough vaccinated people are suffering from blood clots and ADE, my hope is the vaccine’s role in that will be undeniable and they’ll have to start relaxing mandates. </p>
<p>This isn’t something I wish to happen, or would celebrate happening...I <em>hope</em> the vaccines are mostly harmless, and that the doomsday some doctors have been predicting doesn’t become reality. There are so many people who had absolutely no other choice, and those who legitimately didn’t know better, and I don’t want them to suffer. It’s wicked that governments are playing Russian Roulette with our lives.</p>
<p>So if you have <em>any</em> option to not get vaccinated, if you can still hold on a little longer, even if it means you need to sacrifice going out in person with friends or skipping a concert for a year or two, please consider waiting. If a year goes by and the majority of the vaccinated are all on their 5th booster and doing just fine, then you can know you’re not taking a big risk. You can take the jab any time, but you can never untake it...it may never be 100% safe, but we have no idea if it’s even 50% safe, yet. Don’t gamble with the quality of the rest of your life just because you live under a tyrannical regime. Now isn’t the time to give up the fight.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

        <p>I'm Canadian too.  Yeah...  Our country is really in the dumps right now.</p>
<p>We have a clown as a Prime Minister, and the Pravda as our Nationally funded broadcaster.  </p>
<p>Our country is drifting directly towards authoritarian Communism.  What you are feeling is the angst of knowing and understanding this, but feeling powerless to do anything about it.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do about it either.  I don't think there is much we can do.  I take small hope in the knowledge there are many others like us, and that the narrative is falling apart daily.  I can't offer much hope after that.</p>
<p>Try to enjoy your life as much as you can.  That's pretty much all I can say right now.</p>
