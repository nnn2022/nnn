    <strong>Should I ask to film the solicitors?</strong>
    <p><p>Mentally preparing for if and when these people come knocking on my door and I want to have questions ready for them but I‚Äôll also walk out with my professional camera set up and ask if they mind if I film the interaction, they should have nothing to be nervous about right? Many people have ring cameras anyway. I‚Äôll put together my own script just like they are doing.</p>
<p>I know some people think we shouldn‚Äôt disclose our private medical information but I‚Äôd truly love to put these people on the spot. Can we think of the best questions to corner them? Or is this a bad idea?</p>
<p>Edit: the goal isn‚Äôt for legal protection, I just want to put them in their place and potentially post it for everyone to see.</p></p>

        <p>Some states have sane laws, which allow recording of a private conversation as long as ONE party is aware they are being recorded.</p>
<p>That means you can record yourself in a conversation with someone and you don't have to tell them... But you can't record other people if you are not a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>Other states like California (of course) have laws that prevent recording conversations unless ALL parties are aware they are being recorded. This, of course, is to protect wrongdoers (usually wealthy ones and police.)</p>
<p>There also may be a difference between laws that make recording legal/illegal and laws that allow it in court.</p>
<p>It's worth finding out what your state laws are in this regard.</p>
<p>I would say the most INCRIMINATING video will happen if the person doesn't think they are being recorded.</p>
<p><strong>The most important thing to find out is if they are tracking the addresses of who is unvaccinated.</strong> Names, too, obviously, but I don't think they will be that obvious. An address is all they need.</p>
<p>If you can obtain proof that they are tracking this information that would be useful.</p>

        <p>Yeah I'm not a lawyer (if that's not obvious, lol) -- when I looked into it, it was in regard to whether a recording with a landlord which indicated their guilt would be admissable in court. In Texas? Yes. California? No.</p>
<p>Here's a page regarding California law:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stimmel-law.com/en/articles/secret-recording-conversations-california-crime">https://www.stimmel-law.com/en/articles/secret-recording-conversations-california-crime</a></p>
<p>Texas:</p>
<p>&rt;Under Texas Law, it is a crime intercept or record any wire, oral or electronic communication without the consent of at least one party. The good news is that you count as one party and if you're recording then you have probably given yourself consent to record the conversation</p>
<p>I mean look --- just do it, regardless. I didn't mean to complicate the issue bringing up court. You're not taking it to court.</p>
<p>But if you capture them saying something they shouldn't have --- blur his or her face before you release it on the internet just to be safe.</p>
<p>Again -- DO IT, by all means!!! But look up the specific laws in your state so you handle it in a way to protect yourself. (Even if that means hiding the whole thing altogether.)</p>
<p>Sorry to overcomplicate the matter.</p>

        <p>I was caught off guard, I thought it was just a salesperson - we get them from time to time. This was about a week before we heard the national announcement.</p>
<p>It was a young lady, maybe 25-32? She was masked, so I can't say for sure. She was friendly, polite, and when I refused to talk to her about it rather aggressively she backed up and politely apologized and started to leave.</p>
<p>Then I awkwardly said, "Good luck though!"</p>
<p>So it's a pretty uneventful story... Like I said, I wasn't expecting it so I didn't think to inquire more.</p>
<p>She had a clipboard and was apparently noting the results of her door-to-door check, and she also had a bag with her. I don't know what was inside, but it may have just been water or something. It has been warm here.</p>

        <p>All states have this because of federal law. Some states go a step further and require two party consent as an addiion. You were correct overall, I just wanted to provide additional color around the topic.</p>

        <p>Only tell them you are recording if your state requires it. The rules are typically only about what is admissible in court and your goal is just to share the video so it probably falls under slightly different jurisdiction but better to be safe than sorry, always CYA.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm conflicted about how to deal with the door knockers. </p>
<p>I thought about just not answering the door but I think this will result in them continually returning and knocking. (That‚Äôs how it worked with the census people)</p>
<p>I thought about telling them I‚Äôm vaccinated and then saying something stupid like ‚ÄúBelieve Science‚Äù so they think I‚Äôm one of them - But if they are knocking on my door they already know I‚Äôm not vaccinated.</p>
<p>I thought about answering the door and telling them I‚Äôm hard of hearing and asking to read the paper they have... but all this accomplishes is getting access to their script - possibly their list.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think anyone knocking on doors understands the vaccine well enough to discuss or debate it independently and I don‚Äôt think there is any benefit to trying to do that with them. </p>
<p>I have thought about signing up to be a door knocker so I could help others navigate this. I am strongly considering adding a ‚Äúno canvassing‚Äù sign next to my ‚Äúno trespassing‚Äù sign.</p>

        <p>There are potentially a few ways to get access to the script. Another method could be to say something like ‚ÄúI have a family member who is reluctant to get vaccinated and I want to be better equipped to discuss it with them, can I see the materials you have? I‚Äôd like to see something that reads like a conversation for ideas so I can present it to them in a non threatening way.‚Äù</p>

        <p>You'll probably get a lot of laughs because I'm guessing they're entry-level nobodies hired off the street, not vaccine fanatics. You'll be able to debate circles around them. People imagine Dolores Umbridge showing up at their door, but it's probably just some loser who needed a job.</p>
