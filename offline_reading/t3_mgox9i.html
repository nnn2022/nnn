        <p>What‚Äôs interesting is how many of their comments share a similar theme to the sort of themes you see posted here, echo chambers, media brainwashing, flexing bans. There are so many comments I‚Äôd like to respond to and say we think exactly the same thing about you. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs really awful how everything is so polarised these days. I don‚Äôt think this sub is by any means perfect and I think there are a lot of people that post here who I don‚Äôt agree with. That said, I really think that any time anyone on this sub tries to advocate brigading or censorship towards opposing views, they are quickly rebuked and told that this would be a case of sinking to their level. </p>
<p>Never forget that we are the ones advocating for liberty and that will never be seen as such a bad thing with the benefit of hindsight. Their way of thinking is completely unsustainable and unpalatable to the man on the Clapham omnibus.</p>

        <p>This comment is what really separates this sub from the others though. Personally, I don‚Äôt think we should even cross post when subs talk about this one. I don‚Äôt care what they think and I don‚Äôt think anyone else should either. Let them be afraid. If they wish to come here and engage in civil discourse then by all means. But just sharing this stuff for the sake of saying, ‚Äúhey look these people think differently than us‚Äù is no different than what they do IMO.</p>

        <p>Mask/ Vaccine/ Lockdown Science for Reddit </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"It should be concluded from these and similar studies that the filter material of face masks does not retain or filter out viruses." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Yet there is no convincing scientific data that supports the effectiveness of masks for respiratory protection" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Masks will always fit fairly loosely with considerable gaps along the cheeks, around the bridge of the nose and along the bottom edge of the mask below the chin." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"By making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, at the end of the day, the only thing that provides personal protection for the person wearing the mask is a respirator. And that is the thing that healthcare workers should be wearing" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"My biggest problem with telling people they can wear masks is it gives you this false sense of security. And it might even encourage you to think that now you‚Äôre protected and you‚Äôre protecting people around you." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"just want them to understand that they aren‚Äôt very much more protective than if they weren‚Äôt wearing them. And they‚Äôre really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.‚Äù </p>

<p>the person involved [in experimentation] should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.‚Äù¬† </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúProper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúDelorme‚Äôs hospital went from seeing roughly 20 suicide attempts per month involving patients 15 or younger, the AP reports, to more than double that‚Äîand, disturbingly, more determination than ever before in the attempts.‚Äù¬† </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúIn the meantime, lockdowns and other restrictions have harshly curtailed social interaction and, tragically, catalyzing the aforementioned youth mental health crisis. Here in the US, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 25 percent of young adults considered suicide during the lockdowns, while overall mental health and suicide rates appear to have spiked as well.‚Äù¬† </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúComing from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health ‚Äì leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden.‚Äù¬† </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúThose who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume."¬† </p>

<p>‚Äú Only 17% of doctors say they will get a COVID-19 vaccine if it is authorized before all clinical trials‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúNurses were less likely than doctors to say yes (11%); 69% said no; and 20% said they were unsure. Answers did not vary substantially by age.‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúOn April 12, 1955 the government announced the first vaccine to protect kids against polio. Within days, labs had made thousands of lots of the vaccine. Batches made by one company, Cutter Labs, accidentally contained live polio virus and it caused an outbreak. More than 200,000 children got the polio vaccine, but within days the government had to abandon the program. "Forty thousand kids got polio. Some had low levels, a couple hundred were left with paralysis, and about 10 died," said Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician, distinguished professor, and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan.‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúFrom 1955 to 1963, between 10% and 30% of polio vaccines were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40).‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúThe government launched the program in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúOne, the vaccine may not be safe. Two, if it is not safe, people will lose faith in vaccines. Three, if a vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, people will have a false sense of security and increase their risk. Four, if a substandard vaccine gets an EUA, a better vaccine may never get approval, because people would be reluctant to enroll in trials and risk getting a placebo instead of a vaccine.‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúAside from questions of safety that attend any vaccine, there are good reasons to be especially cautious for COVID-19. Some vaccines worsen the consequences of infection rather than protect, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE has been observed in previous attempts to develop coronavirus vaccines.‚Äù </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúAs recently as 2016, Dengavxia, intended to protect children from the dengue virus, increased hospitalizations for children who received the vaccine.‚Äù¬† </p>
