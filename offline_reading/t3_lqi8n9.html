    <strong>Theory, what is cov-sars-2 is just a mutated influenza virus?</strong>
    <p><p>This theory popped in my mind few days ago.</p>
<p>Influenza cases are down. Obviously influenza doesn't just disappear like that.</p>
<p>I know that influenza is not tested currently as much as in previous years but it is still being tested globally and test results are pretty much negative for regular influenza A and B.</p>
<p>What if cov-sars-2 is just heavily mutated influenza virus? I know that influenza and corona are part of totally different virus families and mutations happens few amino acids at the time but is it totally impossible to develop such a huge mutation?</p>
<p>Or maybe I am just overthinking and covid is just rebranded flu and influenza A and B results are not reported to public :)  </p>
<p>edit: Just wanted to say how thankful I am for this sub! Only place where I can actually say something if I have thoughts that differs from the main stream media.</p></p>

        <p>If anyone has symptoms they are assumed to have covid and if anyone with symptoms tests negative then they repeatedly test until a positive is achieved. No one is testing for the flu at all.There are four common coronaviruses that are all lumped together as common colds and each one likely had a major outbreak when they first jumped to humans. As more people are exposed, general immunity will go up and hopefully in a few years this will be lumped in with the four and mostly forgotten as a minor nuisance.</p>

<p>even though the symptoms are exactly the same as the flu, <em>Oh but I can't taste my chicken tendies, it must be covid19</em> they will screech, nope...</p>
