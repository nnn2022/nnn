    <strong>Vaccines going back to normal only if?!</strong>
    <p><p>How come it will only be ok to gather if EVERYONE has the vax? If one person is vax, shouldn't that protect them from everyone else who isn't?</p></p>

        <p>The rhetoric is characterizing "normal" as being carefully rationed to the "vaxxed"... the inconsistency is itself consistent with how this situation is being handled from the start.  It's been a year since "two weeks to flatten the curve" was rolled out and the restriction orgy got its start.</p>

        <p>"Great question, fellow human! While it is believed that the purpose of vaccines is to prevent certain illness, a recent study from the latest edition of Vox Health has shown that vaccines have an efficacy rate that varies depending on the fluctuating levels of co2 emissions in the atmosphere which, the compounding issue of climate change that we've done little, if anything at all, to combat obviously doesn't help this situation. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/images/line_chart_label_colored.jpg">check out this chart</a>. Notice anything? Exactly. The masks work as you can plainly see by the times the lines go down and we were wearing them. You see that dramatic uprise on the graph? If you look at the dates you'll find it as no surprise that's when the insurrection happened, an event that set us back some signifcantly. All in all, we just need to keep our noses to the grindstone but if we all work together we can beat this thing! Hopefully this helps, stranger!"

        <p>Logically, only 70% of the population is needed to be vaccinated for a virus to slowly disappear.</p>
<p>But that logic "changed" when this pandemic showed up. Turns out that it is not useful for the elite anymore.</p>

        <p>So? If the vaccine prevents you from getting a severe case of it, why does it matter if transmission is still possible if everyone who wants to be ‚Äúprotected‚Äù gets it? Sure I can still spread it but everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to deal with that can get their own vaccines to protect themselves and then it really doesn‚Äôt matter. Them constantly bringing this up is incredibly annoying</p>

        <p>It's called herd immunity, it's not about the individual, it's about not maintaining somewhere for the virus to live and be transmitted, it's about protecting those who have legitimate reasons, not paranoia or conspiracy theories, to not be vaccinated, like polio, measles, etc.</p>

        <p>Except exposure runs the risk of killing someone, so getting a vaccine is a much safer alternative to actually getting the illness, and if getting the illness is the only way to get immunity and have immunity then there is no point to trying to get to herd immunity because everyone would have to get it to be immune, thus eliminating the very idea of herd immunity to begin with.</p>

        <p>That's untrue. Many more people get the flue vac and people still get the flu. The flu has many different strains just like covid. We already have new strains of covid that we can't vac for. So all this $$$ going into it is pointless. People are dying from covid either. They are dying from pneumonia, which sets in due to covid, but people who get the flu can also get pneumonia and they aren't dying.</p>

        <p>You can die from pneumonia just from having it alone! No it doesn't matter how they got it, bc the cause of death is still the same regardless!</p>

        <p>Of course it matters how they got it.</p>
<p>If there is a clear correlation between death from pneumonia when it is caused by A but not when caused by B then it is still important and A is clearly a major contributing factor to the death.</p>
<p>You also clearly don't understand how cause of death works, there is  rarely ever a sole cause of death.</p>
<p>Someone can die from lack of oxygen to the brain as the actual cause of death, but the secondary cause could be choking on a piece of food that is too big, strangulation, drowning, or any other number of things.</p>
<p>Just because something isn't the immediate cause of death doesn't mean it isn't the cause of death, it's why every death certificate has multiple lines where it has one immediate cause of death and then a lines under it that say "Due to or as a consequence of" and another section for "Other significant conditions".</p>
<p>By your logic there has never been a single death caused by AIDs or Cancer.</p>

        <p>Regardless of vaccines, herd immunity will be reached. As with all diseases, after enough people have been infected and recovered, we reach herd immunity. The reason we didn't just do that initially was to protect those who may not survive infection. Whatever you think of that, we can agree that vaccines make that irrelevant. If someone is at risk, they can choose to take the vaccine and thus do not have to worry about transmission because they are protected and will not get sick. As for those who choose not to, they are making that decision because they are comfortable with the risk of covid, and the only people they're potentially putting at risk are themselves, but that's their choice. Vaccination is an individual thing, not everyone needs to get it for it to work. In the remaining people who choose not to get a vaccine, the virus will spread and infect them, and they will gain natural immunity. This will contribute to herd immunity, so if not enough people get vaccinated to reach herd immunity this will get us the rest of the way.</p>

<p>That's actually not true though, they are putting any vulnerable people they come in contact with that don't have the ability to get the vaccine at risk by their actions.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but there comes a point where we can't make sacrifices for these people anymore. We've given up a year of our lives for vulnerable people. If some people have a weak enough immune system not to be able to get the vaccine, they're just going to have to take responsibility themselves. If they don't want to take that risk then they can take precautions, but these people don't get to override bodily autonomy for everyone - we've given up enough.</p>

        <p>There's this thing called personal responsibility. The majority of people can get the vaccine and take responsibility for their own health. It's not my responsibility to inject unwanted substances for the few who can't. If the risk of covid bothers those people, they'll have to take it into their own hands. There are limits and boundaries when it comes to protecting strangers, and irreversible medical procedures are one of them.</p>
