        <p>This was completely forseeable lol</p>
<p>Even if it was just for money, they would not miss the chance to sell mandatory doses to the whole world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that is not the case. We are on the verge of the no turning back point.</p>
<p>Soon everyone will have to decide between what is right amd what is easy.</p>

        <p>LOL I can’t believe this is a shock to people. I remember when my coworkers got the shot and their green passport (Israel) expires in six months. They were like what ever could that mean?? I was like it means y’all need another vaccine when it expires!! Of course none of this was info they were given before taking the vaccine. Fucking criminal.</p>

        <p>Did people really think they were going to let this massive vaccine infrastructure they just built go to waste? All these new billion dollar factories all across the world for just one season of Covid? Lol, no. The new normal is multiple shots. Every year. Forever. This is Satan’s world (for now) and we’re just living in it.</p>
