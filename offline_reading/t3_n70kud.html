    <strong>Actually felt free and felt so good (=</strong>
    <p><p>I went out last night to the beauty supply store just for something small. I kept in mind how Desantis got rid of Covid restrictions just a few days ago so I also wanted to see if any businesses would take it seriously. 
I walked across the parking lot and held my hair wrap band thingy that i been using for a "mask" in my hand just incase i ran in to any issues while inside. As I approach the door i can see the door looking blank. All the mask signage was down. I thought, "ok, well we're going in then." I put my "mask" back in my purse". As im about to enter I notice a woman on the phone we approach the door at the same time, I offer to let her go in first and she quickly puts her mask on. Who knows if she knows, I didn't care. It felt good to have the law on my side for once. I enter, I grab what I need and I'm walking back to the front to pay. I see other customers with masks on. But im not surprised. You see I live in on of the top blue counties in South FL(the propaganda is wild out here). So it doesn't phase me especially when you know the truth. 
I go up to pay and it was hard to hold back the smiles and inner laughter i had. This was the same store that made me pay for a mask last year when i didn't have one on. I wanted to laugh so hard but i held it in. The cashier greeted me as normal and I felt so happy that this was all over....for now.</p></p>

        <p>I could care less what other people do, I just wish California would get rid of the mandate so I could have the law on my side. I wouldn't be shocked if California never does though, we have Newsom and he'll probably be replaced by someone equally shitty. As long as you don't have to wear one though, the more people see you the more will feel braver to follow so that's great</p>

        <p>Best bet is to move if you can. I think Tennessee has the same laws regarding covid restrictions as Florida. I think. Its cheaper there too</p>

        <p>Thinking about it, everywhere "good" is pretty far away so it's a bigger decision. Probably will end up doing that though because you guys look like you're actually living while we here have been sitting at home for a year now ðŸ˜µ</p>

        <p>Some of us are living. A lot of people are delusional in South Florida they have their own personalized mask mandate in their heads for whatever reason. Im just glad they cant say anything anymore because its no longer "in the books" so to speak. Im assuming the smaller the city the less people take this whole thing seriously. Tennessee is pretty good too tho.</p>

        <p>Publix still has the signs up but they don't enforce it. I haven't tried Target yet. But I'm done with masks until I have to go the peoples republic of Virginia next month.</p>

        <p>Yea publix was one of the businesses that said they'll still require it but yea i doubt they'll actually enforce it since there's no basis for it anymore.</p>
