        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; Democratic Assemblymen Herb Conaway, D-Conaway and Andrew Zwicker, D-Middlesex, introduced legislation last week that would make the influenza shot a requirement for admission at public and private schools, preschools and colleges and universities.</p>
<p>&rt; The goal is to pass the bill, (A4576) before Oct. 1, “so people can build immunity in their systems in advance of flu season,” said Conaway, a physician.</p>
<p>&rt; Vaccinating students will significantly reduce the number of people experiencing “severe flu symptoms or a severe combination of flu and COVID-19 symptoms,” and “result in fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to influenza,” the bill said.</p>
<p>&rt; The flu vaccine is not among the battery of required vaccines to attend elementary, high school or college in the state. New Jersey already requires children who attend day care and preschool to get the flu shot.</p>
<p>&rt; Sue Collins, co-founder of the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice, said she would testify against any bill mandating the flu vaccine. She noted that the flu vaccine is “notoriously ineffective.”</p>
<p>&rt; And at a moment when people are social distancing, washing their hands more and wearing masks in public, these Covid-19 precautions “will lessen the flu virus and other virus transmission,” Collins said.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>The effectiveness of the flu vaccine in the 2019-20 season ranged from 38% to 44%, depending on a person’s age, according to an analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the prior decade, overall effectiveness ranged from 60% (in 2010-11) to 29% (in 2014-15).</strong></p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Collins also said influenza vaccinations are the most likely to be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System. “Flu vaccine can be highly reactive,” she said. “This is not a vaccine that should be mandated.”</strong></p>

        <p>Theory: this is how they'll create the second wave, via these mandates. Very concerned this year's flu shot will have something special in it to make more people sick.</p>

        <p>Already happening in MA. I would expect it to spread to the rest of the northeast at least.</p>
