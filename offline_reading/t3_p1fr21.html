        <p>According to Dr. Stock:</p>
<p>Point 1: Virus particles go through masks, making masks unnecessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, virus particles go through cloth and surgical masks, even N95 masks, but the mode of transport is an aerosol or droplet, which is much bigger in size. Droplets are the biggest of the two and where most viral transmission occurs. Some droplets get through masks, but masks significantly reduce the number that do. The droplets that make it through, because of their size, contain a lot less virus. In many cases, it will not contain enough virus to infect others.</li>
<li>Aerosols are smaller and get through basic masks with ease. But just like with smaller droplets that get through, they contain smaller amounts of virus. Studies performed on influenza and other <strong>non-COVID-19</strong> coronaviruses show that aerosol infection is possible, but it usually takes a much longer time of exposure. In other words, droplets still remain the biggest risk factor.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Bad advice. Masks don't effectively protect you from aerosols, but they do from droplets, especially when the infected has to wear one as well. Fewer droplets means reduced chance of infection. Of course, the longer you're indoors, the more those aerosols become the greater risk even if everyone wears masks. It depends on ventilation and how close you are to the infected, but a blanket statement against masks is misleading and misguided. You have to ignore a lot of factors to reach that conclusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point 2: A condition known as "antibody-mediated viral enhancement" caused by vaccines results in the immune system fighting the virus wrong, leading to a more severe infection. Studies in animals since the 1st SARS outbreak have shown that RNA vaccines cause this condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>First problem here is that he meant to say "antibody-dependent enhancement" otherwise called ADE. If ADE was truly caused by COVID-19 vaccines, we would see negative efficacy rates of death and severe infection occurring among the vaccinated, but in fact, we are seeing the opposite occur.</li>
<li>Numerous studies have been done on animals, ranging from monkeys (like the macaque) all the way to mice. All studies performed show that the RNA vaccines are highly successful at preventing an infection from moving from mucous membranes into the bloodstream, which is the type of infection that can lead to severe symptoms and death.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Clueless as to why this is a part of his argument. He seems to pull this out of thin air. Blatant nonsense.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point 3: COVID-19 vaccines fail to stop infection and the spread of infection. They just make you less likely to be symptomatic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes and no. Vaccines prevent <em>severe</em> infection but not all infections. The goal of the vaccines isn't to wipeout the virus, because that will never happen (think flu and colds). The goal is to significantly reduce the number of people that die or require hospitalization. It is effective at accomplishing that goal. At some point in time, perhaps years or a decade down the road, the COVID-19 virus will evolve into a less pathogenic form, similar to how other coronaviruses became the common cold. That's the hope anyway, and vaccines will help expedite the process.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Misleading. He is hinging this idea on the assumption that vaccines don't work...<em>at all</em>. But we know that's not the case. Vaccinated individuals have shown to recover more quickly, meaning there is a shorter window of time that the virus can jump from a vaccinated person. Shorter windows mean reduced spread. Furthermore, asymptomatic individuals expel less pathogen (or virus) than a symptomatic individual. Aside from less virus exiting the infected, an asymptomatic person isn't coughing or sneezing, both of which propel droplets and aerosols further (as opposed to talking or breathing). If the vaccines result in quicker recovery and less chance at showing symptoms, then clearly they can make a difference over time. This isn't rocket science, folks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point 4: Treating with vitamin D, ivermectin and zinc adequately defends against serious infection. It is a viable alternative to vaccines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Stock has data from 15 patients to backup this statement. <em>Fifteen</em>! Many docs have individually treated hundreds since the pandemic began, and while many will agree that providing adequate vitamin D and zinc will boost the immune system, not many will tell you with a straight face that it will be enough to prevent COVID-19 infection. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of ivermectin, with conflicting results in different studies.</li>
<li>Conclusion: False. You should never rely on an uncontrolled study, especially one with only 15 participants. Furthermore, vaccines are a part of preventative medicine; they are not treatments. An incorrect categorization here only further weakens the argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong>:</p>
<p>Not everything he is saying is completely inaccurate, but a lot of false assumptions are made in the conclusions he's drawn. When it's not a false assumption, he's completely ignoring factors that would need to be taken into consideration. Then there's all the research he's ignoring or failing to mention. It's one thing to present unfounded theories as opinion, but to present them as fact is disturbing.</p>

        <p>The Dr listed his address and if you look him up, you’ll find his practice. </p>
<p>Give him a call and see if you can meet up. Then go sit with him so you can present your own data that shows you in favor and then have him come back with another video that says he was incorrect because of your grande info. We’ll all wait… thanks.</p>

        <p>I'd consider it, but probably wouldn't be much of a productive conversation, considering he can't even call "antibody-dependent enhancement" by the right name. This is a family practice doc people...wake up! You must really be reaching for straws if you're stooping to this level. Must be hard being an anti-vaxxer!</p>

        <p>No. Just like him, I am up to date with my required vaccinations just not this one. No way will I inject an unlicensed vaccine. Don’t care for EUA. Certify it because my body my choice.</p>

        <p>And you do realize that the FDA reviewed 3 months of data to approve emergency authorized use of the vaccines, correct?</p>
<p>It's not full approval, because that's a much longer process that looks into the manufacture and storage of the vaccines. It's being fast-tracked now and will likely have full FDA approval in the next 2-3 months.</p>
<p>Guessing you'll be singing a different tune when that time comes, eh? 😉</p>
