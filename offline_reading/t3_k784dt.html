    <strong>The hypocritical life of a locked down Latin American</strong>
    <p><p>1- You order practically anything online and they deliver to you. Fancy some expensive French Champagne? Lunch with Argentine meat? Artisanal burger? Any non essential item? Got it in less than 2 hours.</p>
<p>2- Gym closed? What are personal trainers for? You can run laps on the street, no one will arrest you. No police will care about just walking the street.</p>
<p>3- You are at home, but the cleaners, doormen and other workers commuted to cater you. No one in apartment buildings was dismissed. If you have a nanny or a maid, she (because most domestic workers are women) will be commuting to your house, because she is afraid of unemployment.</p>
<p>Personally, although I don´t believe in lockdowns, but I paid two monts of salary for my maid to stay home and I did the cleaning myself and she returned in June. But most domestic workers beg their bosses to not to be dismissed, because they need the money.</p>
<p>4- If you are well connected, you can even go to illegal parties or speakeasies. Every week, the local news tell about some parties busted by the police. Usually, there are some Mercedes or BMWs in the door.</p>
<p>5- Lots of shops with doors half open, if you fancy some shopping.</p>
<p>6- Want a barber or hair dresser? You can go to one with the door half open. You call and they open te door for you. If you want it at your home, they go to it too.</p>
<p>7- You write on instagram #fiqueemcasa or #quedateencasa when at least half of society is moving about to cater things for YOU to stay at home. Hipocrisy abounds.</p>
<p>8- In the poor people´s suburbs, everything is open and no one gives a shit. Police does not close shops, bars, churches or hairdressers in the suburbs, only in rich areas.</p>
<p>The city center is a ghost town. The suburbs are bustling with movement.</p>
<p>9- You realize that lockdowns are a complete stupid theater. A top 10% elite pretends to stay home when the rest of society is on the move to cater to them and the enforcement only exists in the central and rich areas. Even when the cities looke like ghost towns, people were in buses, trains and cars doing what they had to do, but in a discreet manner.</p>
<p>10- You realize that, for every imaginable restriction, there is some way to cheat. There were cities where you needed a document proving that your bus ride is essential. What happens? Everybody has a disabled mom that needs care.</p>
<p>11- Police hardly ever enforces restrictions on religious services if the mayor or the local council is a minister, because, in Latin America, the mixing of religion and politics is very strong and it is common to a minister to be in office. The mayor of Rio de Janeiro is a protestant bishop.</p></p>

        <p>Same here.</p>
<p>In rural America nothing ever changed. Shut down bars and restaurants for a couple weeks in the spring.</p>
<p>After that back to business as usual. Bars, theaters, restaurants, buffets, all open. Thank God.</p>

        <p>They realized that CoVid-19 for the majority was nothing more than a bad flu and was not worth the damage to economics in their nation.</p>
<p>BTW: Had my parents die from this virus and had bad symptoms myself from it but had to realize I was not the mean for this virus and neither were my parents.</p>
<p>The issue with OUR case is that a negligent rehab center sent 69 year old Daddy home with this disease to 69 year old Momma and 40 year old I with this disease.</p>
<p>Something they should not have done in the slightest and that I have a malpractice lawyer examining the circumstances about because they knew a week before sending Dad home that they had CV-19 cases (actual SYMPTOM having cases) and didn't do a CV-19 test before sending him home.</p>
<p>Something that the Social Worker handling his case said was negligent.</p>

        <p>Good luck on your case!</p>
<p>Once there is widespread community transmission, the only way out is herd immunity.</p>
<p>Lockdowns only prolong the inevitable.</p>
<p>If hospitals are overrun it makes sense, under any other circumstance, it is insanity.</p>
