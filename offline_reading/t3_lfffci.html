    <strong>Saw an Idiot Today on My College Campus</strong>
    <p><p>I go to college in a state that is turning blue but is still red at least until 2022. Most students at mycollege are brainwashed sheep that always wear masks even when outside surrounded by nobody. Today, I saw someone really stupid though. She was walking outside a good 30 feet away from me wearing not one, not two, but three fucking masks. How she can breathe with that shit on her face, I have no idea. Why would she be wearing three masks outside away from everybody else. She looked perfectly healthy too and would likely get mild to no symptoms even if she did get Covid.</p></p>

<p>I will answer your question with another question, why would any one be a willing participant in their self destruction? In addition, why would any one in their right mind, in good health (as you pointed out), listen to medical advice without consulting their primary care physician to understand the ramifications of listening to that medical advice?</p>
<p>The only answer is that the individual has surrendered their right to think for themselves, to think logically, critically and reasonably. They have absconded their ability to do any form of analysis, especially when it comes to their personal health, safety and future.</p>

<p>Well, OP <em>did</em> say he was on a college campus, so your post kind of goes without saying.</p>

        <p>Three masks? What a clown. Never mind only one mask works and it’s the disposable kind you have to put in the trash after one use because it’s designed for it</p>
<p>Cloth masks you made yourself are just adult version of carrying a blanket or teddy around as a kid. It’s a mental thing</p>
