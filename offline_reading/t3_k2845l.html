    <strong>Facial Recognition Thermometers Sighted at Library</strong>
    <p><p>I just saw that they installed facial recognition thermometers at one of my local libraries in NYC.  I have trouble seeing it as anything other than a veiled attempt at surveillance. Current library policy does not allow patrons to congregate; you can browse the collection or use the computers. Library usage is limited to picking up and dropping off, so a person would not spend more than a few minutes in the library at a time and will not come into contact with another patron for more than a passing moment, if at all. Consequently, it is highly improbable that the library would be a source of spread.</p>
<p>Since the library poses such a minimal risk, I have to assume this is simply an attempt to use the library to create an access point for government to target healthy individuals who it otherwise would not have access to. Clearly, if you show up to the library with a fever, you will be turned away and presumably the government will use its facial recognition data to track you down and force you and those you know to test and quarantine, which is terrifying enough in my eyes. But moreover, how far will that extend? Will the other patrons who happened to use the library that same day also be traced and told they are COVID risks for such a tenuous connection?  Will they be forced to quarantine and restricted from their places of employment or forced to submit to unnecessary medical intervention to prove their innocence? Will this remain standard library protocol even after the pandemic is finally deemed ended? Will it be installed in other public places? </p>
<p>We are straying so far down a path of government surveillance and control that I do not know if we will ever be able to retreat.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen many companies instituting temperature checks that look like they are capable of facial recognition as well. Creepy stuff.</p>

<p>Simply becouse you like to read it doesn't mean you are healthy</p>
<p>Also one of the things I like about this pandemic is that I'm required to wear a face blocking object when passing by one of those things</p>
<p>And one way to look at this whole situation is that the EU or whoever your big brother might be is a milk cow and your country is the guy who milks it, as long as there are money to get they would buy cool but unnecessary stuff to fight the pandemic</p>

<p>The term "healthy" can be debateable, but the point is that most of the people using the thermometer are not actively sick and are not exhibiting symptoms that would justify medical intrusion into their lives. We are not all patients-in-waiting. </p>

<p>Apparently they have mask-proof facial recognition thermometers (see <a href="https://www.turnstiles.us/product/cvx021-contactless-facial-recognition-infrared-thermometer/">https://www.turnstiles.us/product/cvx021-contactless-facial-recognition-infrared-thermometer/</a>). While I have no conclusive evidence on the matter for the one I observed, logic tells me that it would also be mask-proof technology since everyone who uses it will be wearing a face covering. It would be useless otherwise.</p>

<p>What? How is this supposed to be consolation for the lack of citizens' privacy and autonomy?</p>

<p>It's not in any way, but mostly how it goes is we need XXX$ amount of money to buy this equipment to fight the pandemic and its over our budget, XX$ gets spend on the equipment and the rest gets in the middle man's pocket </p>

<p>I belive some of the face scanning equipment was avaliable before the pandemic and whether or not the anti mask feature works is mostly about of how big of a mask you can get</p>
