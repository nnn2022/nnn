        <p>That's so weird! When there was an outbreak of a deadly virus in the Papal States during the 1860s, things got so bad that the streets and homes were full of dead bodies. A local town's government had completely collapsed and it's leaders fled the town. The Pope had to send the Roman military into the town just to deal with the bodies and infected. Some of the soldiers died but they eventually got the outbreak under control.</p>
<p>A century and a half later you're telling me that we didn't even need field hospitals for an extremely deadly pandemic that spread further than the one in the Papal States? No families starving in their homes because they're afraid to leave and get infected. No clinics totally overrun or abandoned. Not one government at the local level hasn't collapsed. And none of the national guard had to be patrolling the streets picking up dead bodies?</p>
<p>Wow that's insane. What did they put in the water to help us get through this pandemic with ease?</p>

<p>CRISPR.</p>
<p>What, you missed the wheelbarrows with 'bring out your dead'?</p>
<p>Cuz those were totally happening...somewhere...in between the protests and rallies.</p>
<p>Here in LA I remember reading we were so overwhelmed with dead that they had to change the rules about burning all the dead bodies that no one got to see before they were burned.
Still don't know a single person who knew anyone that had covid. I know a ton who had bad side effects from the shot.</p>

        <p>I know 10 people that had COVID including myself. Maybe 1 or 2 were wrong, because that was early on. One of them died but was an old, black man that worked at my company that never told me about his medical status. Maybe he had health problems I didn't know about.</p>

        <p>The big lie related to "fluoride" is that it is a single thing. </p>
<p>&rt;Although sodium fluoride was the first compound to be used within our country’s tap water system in 1945, it has since been changed to a different compound called fluorosilicic acid.</p>
<p>The idea that they merely switched to sodium-fluoride is wrong. In a lot of places they use a complex, industrial waste product that simply has at least one fluorine atom in it. Therefore they get to call it fluoride and pretend it's exactly the same as calcium-fluoride or sodium-fluoride.</p>

        <p>The complex fluoride is a waste product produced by the phosphate fertilizer industry. It's just an easy way to get rid of super toxic waste. </p>
<p>About a decade ago I read an article about a guy in fluoride who invented a machine that rips substances apart at the atomic level. Seems like they could have one of those to deal with any waste product by now.</p>

        <p>Bacterial infection (like TB), has been demonstrated to occur. If you give a rat mycobacterium, it is likely to develop TB. If you expose other rats to that first rat, they are likely to develop TB too. This bacteria is practically invisible, but it's the only class of invisible monster supported by evidence. Yet, I am not afraid of TB, and you probably are also not afraid of it.</p>
<p>Viruses do not have any such evidence to suggest that they are the cause of infection. If you exposed a rat suffering symptoms of a virus to another rat, the second rat will not get sick. To test vaccines on animals, they have to inject a concoction of substances into each rat to make them sick.  </p>
<p>That is what it really comes down to, what goes into your body.</p>
<p>We know from first hand experience, if you eat moldy cheese, you could develop food poisoning from ingesting bacteria. What happens then? You get fever, upset stomach, puking, cold sweats, etc. In other words, flu symptoms.</p>

        <p>I read an interesting evolutionary theory of why people tend to get nauseous themselves when they hear or see another person vomit. </p>
<p>The theory is that if you are near someone else while they get sick, then it’s likely they are a part of your “tribe”. Meaning you could have likely eaten the same thing. And if one person in your tribe is sick, it could mean you all ate something dangerous and your body wants to purge itself of it.</p>

        <p>It's an interesting idea. Something similar has been observed in the plant kingdom, it's part of their immune system. Plants are connected by root networks. They send microorganisms to each other as signals to each other. They are basically helping each other grow, because trees are stronger when they grow together.</p>

        <p>There is an increase in viral load in people who have flu symptoms, some people can handle them without a problem. Viruses are real, but im open to the idea that maybe they don't cause the disease I'd need to see some science though.</p>

        <p>Yes, viruses are real. They may contribute to illness to some degree, it's an open question. Most medical science has assumed a priori, without evidence, that most medical problems are related to viruses. And we are witnessing the worst case outcome of that problem.</p>
<p>If medical science were open to asking different questions about illness, the world would probably be a much nicer place. There is interesting history behind all of this. Germ vs Terrain Theories. Bechamp and Pasteur.</p>

        <p>Quick maffs. Without any sort of prevention, nor cure, the 1860 cholera outbreak, killed around 5.5% of Chicago's population (3500 people), infecting a great majority of the population (as it was common back then, nowadays understanding of viruses and bacterium have lead to a sharp increase in prevention and precaution, leading to a lower number of infected people). </p>
<p>Assuming it took a roughly equal percentage of lives on the Papal States, that means out of the projected 3.124.668 innabitants in 1853, 171.856 died. That's over 170 thousand, on a time when medicine, news, and just general knowledge were mostly non-existent. It's easy to imagine why 170 thousand dead, would easily overwhelm any local government. Without modern power tools, any government would be hard pressed to deal with 170k corpses by hand, as there simply wouldn't be enough gave diggers, or people/carriages to go around to drag the bodies to a mass grave.</p>
<p>NY went from 25 burials a week in mass graves (reserved to poor people who can't afford a funeral, and unclaimed corpses), to 25 burials a day, during USA's phase I of Covid. But we have access to heavy machinery nowadays, so the logistics (opening the holes, transporting the bodies, etc) was mostly solved by motor vehicles.</p>
<p>This is the same logic used to question the reported historical numbers of the Thermopylae battle (aka the 300 spartans v persians), by merely examining the logistics back then.</p>

        <p>I believe a lot of field hospitals were set up by the Trump administration as well as the hospital ships in California and New York. A lot of the governors did not want to use Trump's field hospitals because that would make him look good. So the obvious solution was to send those sick into nursing homes.</p>

        <p>I also believe that the governors specifically asked for all of this equipment from Trump knowing they would never use it, but praying he didn't have the resources to actually provide it.  </p>
<p>They were planning to use the first...</p>
<p>"Sorry we just can't swing that right now.  You have to make do without it."</p>
<p>As an insurance policy so they could blame him for any deaths that came afterward.</p>
<p>They really underestimated the strength of the Federal Government to get their shit together in an "emergency" and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Loved how Trump essentially told them he would give them whatever the fuck they wanted, but if they were expecting a blank check from the government to bail them out of years of failed policy, they weren't going to get it.  </p>
<p>Of course the second Biden got in that's exactly what he gave these States.  Here in NJ they are discussing spending one billion dollars rebuilding playgrounds in the inner cities with the surplus of cash they got from Covid relief.  How the fuck is that permitted?</p>

        <p>Nobody forgot about viral interference, it’s the fundamental concept of vaccination.
Most of all virology is based on these hypothetical assumptions which see correlation in a process and attempt to describe it. Don’t assume that viral interference is an infallible mechanism, rather it might be a mechanism used to try to fit a narrative. It doesn’t make it a true.</p>
<p>The more likely reason the flu cases have went down is purely political and another example of diagnostic manipulation.</p>

        <p>That’s a very good question. I don’t know where it went. But I’ve seen it with my own eyes. I’ve worked many “flu seasons”. I promise you man people were not coming in with influenza. You can see it a mile away. I only had 1 positive flu patients last year. These people were definitely coming in with COVID - they looked waaay different than influenza plus the lack of smell and taste is very unique. Hard to explain but when you work with sick patients all day almost every day it’s very easy to spot. </p>
<p>Honestly, I think viral interference is more likely the reason as I don’t think masks work. But honestly if I didn’t work in medicine Id almost certainly think that it was influenza.</p>

        <p>We shut down our entire economy over a virus that only kills those who are elderly, obese, or have some other comorbidity. The elderly should have stayed home while the rest looked after their health and did the best they could to social distance while still working. We would've avoided trillions of dollars worth of damage done by the ridiculous lockdowns.</p>
