        <p>I live in Illinois, and sadly yep can totally confirm Pritzker is such a damn buzzkill prick.</p>
<p>-Overreacts and closes down indoor dining and indoor drinking, in all 11 COVID health regions of the state. I've heard reports a lot of restaurants and bars(at least in the more rural parts of IL) are now saying fuck it, and quietly are remaining open for indoors now. A lot of IL counties and cities/suburbs/towns, have come out and said that they won't enforce this new order on restaurants/bars. And at least one COVID health region(the one in northwest Illinois with Rockford) sadly had stricter mitigations imposed on it, such as that gatherings couldn't be bigger than 10 people. Under the mitigations in other regions that were just imposed, this was set at 25 people. I believe before all these new health regions had mitigations imposed on them at the end of October, this was at 50. Sadly, I can just tell that it's a matter of time before this crap is imposed on the other 10 COVID health regions. </p>
<p>-He was stupidly trying to not allow medium and high risk high school(i.e. basketball being medium risk IIRC, football was high risk) sports to occur. It was where the head of the Illinois High School Association(IHSA) finally told him back(not in these exact words, but essentially their response back to him and the Illinois Department of Health meant that) fuck you, we don't care what you're saying and will play those sports. And any high schools, coaches, and students wanting to play those sports again, were welcome to participate. Keep in mind when all this stuff started, that Pritzker did an exception for horse riding/equestrian events where those youth sports events didn't have to stop, YET all other such sports events had to. Sadly yep him saying rules for me, but not for thee. (or however that quote exactly goes, someone want to tell me if I got the saying right?) It does NOT make sense at all to be only one of a handful of a states(3-5?), still not allowing high school sports to resume. If the Big 10 can vote to bring back college sports, and ditto with other states voting to bring back high school sports(i.e. Minnesota, Michigan), certainly it won't be the end of the world to allow high school athletes to come back in Illinois.</p>
<p>Hopefully whoever challenges him in 2022(doubt whoever beats him will be out of the Democrat primary, but that probably it'll take a GOP challenger to do it), will beat him and he won't get another term. Also LMAO that he wasted something like $55-60 million on the 'fair tax'(my ass, won't be when later on the lower income levels get soaked with an increased income tax, look at Connecticut for what would've occurred here if that crap passed) graduated income tax ballot initiative, that was never going to pass. That failed IIRC, with something like 54% no votes. Ugh those ads were really obnoxious, to the point they tried annoying ads like that stupid 'we may be slightly different on our politics(one Democrat, one Republican), but we're both voting for the fair tax'. I'm glad in real life, that people think about this stuff a little more critically. Also, this initative(if it had passed) would've done nothing, to fix the cost of pensions.</p>

        <p>The IDPH actually switched basketball to high risk out of absolutely nowhere, like minutes before the IHSA was about to have a meeting about it. While the IHSA said basketball can go ahead, I'm thinking most schools are going to end up opting out. Word is liability insurance companies won't cover schools that play.</p>
