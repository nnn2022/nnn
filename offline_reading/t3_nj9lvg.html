    <strong>Are there any states that won't require hospital employees to take the experimental injection?</strong>
    <p><p>The hospital I work for in the state of Pennsylvania is now requiring that all employees get the Covid 'vaccine' within the next few months or else be terminated. Of course, they offer a medical or religious exemption but also state that certain positions will not be allowed to have an exemption. I am fairly certain that this means those positions providing direct patient care, like a nurse or patient care assistant (I will find out for sure). So I am screwed. I will not get the injection. I knew this was coming but I thought they would at least wait until there was FDA approval. Not so. Some thanks I get for having worked on the Covid floors for the past year. </p>
<p>I am also asking because I have a young adult child that just graduated with a health science degree from a local college that pays for 75% of your tuition if you work part time for the hospital that I work at while you are in school <em>and</em> work for one year post graduation in the position you went to school for. Now this child is also screwed because, if he/she does not get the 'vaccine', he/she will be required to pay back the $70,000 tuition within 3 months' time because he/she cannot fulfill the 'work for one year post graduation' requirement. That is a breach of contract, in my opinion, on their part.</p>
<p>So, can anyone tell me if there is a hospital somewhere in this nation that does not and will not require the injection as a means of employment? We, as parents, would pay the $70,000 in a heartbeat if our young adult child could be assured of an injection-free hospital job in another state.</p></p>

        <p>Florida it’s illegal to mandate them at public institutions, so if a hospital is state/county-owned, they can’t require it. Private hospitals are probably another story though</p>

        <p>Your comment was very helpful. I was unaware of Florida's laws (I'll look into FL and TX laws further) and unaware about the existence of regular public hospitals. In PA, the only public hospitals we have are state psychiatric hospitals - that's it. Thanks!</p>

        <p>I’m not sure about state specific regulations, but it may be worth looking into workers’ compensation policies. I probably wouldn’t talk to HR directly about it until gathering more information, possibly from a lawyer from your state who specializes in workers’ compensation. It could be worth 150 bucks or however much a consultation would cost. </p>
<p>I think a lot of employers are bluffing. They say that it will be required by a certain date (without flat out requiring it) so many people will run out and get it. Then they may change their tune as the deadline approaches to avoid liability. </p>

        <p>With regards to your son/daughter, it is a clear breach of contract. I'm sure he/she would have never signed it had he known he would have to partake in a human experiment.  Read through the contract he signed and see if there are any provisions in there that could even remotely be construed as required vaccinations as a condition of the contract.  Your money might be better spent on a lawyer.</p>

        <p>Well, for starters, they are saying that "we will work on this process in the coming weeks", meaning providing us with the steps to request an exemption. So, they throw out this mandate then don't have everything in place for those who want to exempt themselves from it. Very nice. Feels like a stall tactic.</p>

        <p>It may be a violation of ADA laws, as well. They can mandate the vaccine, but they must provide accommodation if you can’t take the vaccine (and they’re not allowed to ask why you can’t take one)...AKA, they’ll probably make you wear a mask if you don’t get vaccinated. They can only terminate your employment if “accommodations can’t be made”, but they can’t say that if masks have been acceptable up til now.</p>
