    <strong>Nurses discriminating again unvaccinated ???</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone here keep an eye on the nursing subreddit? I am an RN so I’ve been a part of that group for years. I see multiple posts a day now of nurses complaining about “anti vax” colleagues, in the context of these new vaccine mandates for hospitals. Also I’ve seen them post how they don’t treat unvaccinated patients the same. It’s insane! I worked ICU and had to treat people regardless, many were drug addicts or morbidly obese, but I didn’t provide them lesser care  because I felt they brought illnesses on themselves .... I also used to work in a forensic mental health facility and had to work with rapists and murderers.... the whole point is I was their NURSE and still had to provide them medical care.  In that role, it wasn’t my place to judge but my place to provide medical care. I don’t understand what is fucking happening but everyone’s lost their goddamn minds. How is this ok??! I see colleagues posting the same shit on FB and I don’t even know what to say. I am not getting this “vaccine” and it just is so hard for me to wrap my head around it. One nurse on that subreddit even said that they hope insurance doesn’t cover medical bills for the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Help!!! I don’t know what to do. And if my job mandates the vaccine I’m going to quit but I don’t even know where to look for work.  I posted the other day I’m looking to relocate, and Florida or Texas is looking better and better each day. I hope there’s still some sane people there. </p>
<p>Is anyone else on here a nurse?? How are you handling your coworkers and where are you finding work? I currently work from home which means it would make NO sense for my employer to mandate the vaccine, but common sense doesn’t seem to exist anymore.</p></p>

        <p>Yea. The whole thing makes no sense but we are labeled “anti science” “anti vax” and “conspiracy theorists”.   Fucking insanity. I’m truly worried I soon will be unemployed and unable to go shopping without showing my vaccine card.  I live in NJ which is terrible now but I’m thankful every day that it isn’t fucking California. They seem to be the worst with all this shit so far.</p>

        <p>im sorry, NJ much like NY, CA, and usually NJ follows right behind them</p>
<p>in Germany the vax passport will be tied to your bank card which will not work unless you have taken the poison.  passport will not be optional.  everyone will have one.</p>

<p>I feel like people want to call me “selfish” for not getting the vaccine even though I think it’s selfish to force others to take something to suit THEIR needs. This reminds me of when these dudes in dresses wanted to use women’s restrooms but if we complained it made us uncomfortable, we were the assholes. Sure I have the change MY comfort level to suit everyone else’s.</p>

        <p>the dudes in dresses, that was our mental conditioning.  fortunately in your case, you work in a field that has a shortage of workers and takes time, training and money to become qualified.  while it may take a move, youll always be able to find a job.</p>

<p>youll have to seach <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo.com</a> to find relevant articles.</p>
<p>as i understand it is proposed at this point, but, if proposed and to the detriment of personal liberty, in this climate, its already happened, just a matter of it being rolled out.</p>
<p>just like fraudci, in yesterday morning he was calling for the FDA to give full approval to vaxx poison so Feds can mandate usage, by the evening news, they were saying they should have fda approval by the end of the month.</p>

<p>Yes, even the most radical proposals have a funny way of becoming rules lately. The pass sanitaire was once just a "proposal", and the Président de la République said on national television, with a straight face, that it would NEVER happen and that vaccination would NEVER be mandated. But here we are ...</p>

        <p>specific with regard to the vaccine passport/bank card connection.  this was predicted by ex pfizer VP, chief science officer, 16 years at pfizer, in 2019.  at the time, i thought that was a little far fetched, but i am proven wrong.  </p>

        <p>Nurse recruiter here. Not all facilities are mandating the vax at least yet. Some allow for religious or medical exemption. So sorry you are going through this. </p>
<p>Company recently demanded "vax status" for all employees to keep the info in a database. Currently have segregation set up for in office work.</p>
<p>Even in Florida despite what Desantis has done about masks. Places still require them for staff and patrons alike.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why I have zero trust in any medical professionals any more. Especially after 18 months of "" saving the nhs"". Put my health on the line so I can get treated like a sub human piece of shit all because I can make my own medical decisions.</p>
<p>They aren't doctors and nurses any more, as you can't question the""science "" what you have is gospel with a band of ultra orthodox inquisitors to enforce it.</p>

        <p>Yea and the same people who keep talking about following the “science” have been on vacations without masks going to Florida and wherever the fuck and then post shit about how we should all stay home and not gather for like thanksgiving and it’s all our fault for not staying home!! Then they feel the need to constantly post their martyr stories about working in the ICU and how burned out they are. </p>
<p>When I worked at the ICU it was in a HUGE hospital (in the top 3 in the country to not be too specific) and it was ALWAYS FULL. We even regularly flew in sick people from other countries like Abu Dhabi who pretty much came and got to the top of the transplant list because they have ridiculous amounts of $ while average Americans were denied for not having enough $$(but that’s another story for another day).  </p>

        <p>My cousin recently became a nurse, he thought that once he graduated that he would be the authority on health in our family. When he got pushback against the vaxx, he crumbled and ex communicated us. It hilarious how people think, they never cease to amaze me. He thinks because he read a book he becomes an authority on someone's personal health decisions, as if understand science is some sort of impossible thing to do unless your educated. What a joke. It doesnt take more than common sense to know that the pandemic is over blown and that financial interests take more and more control precedence over the situation. He cant accept that though, he is scared because he realized slowly that the health industry has corruption. He HAS to believe he is part of something good so he can work without bad conscience. Its really rather sad.</p>

        <p>I have a family member like that. Medical school and training all cost money and time and very few like to think they've wasted it. I've been studying health for a decade now, I've helped family, friends, even pets with conditions that pharma-led medicine will tell you is incurable. Yet that member will scoff any time I bring up my studies. And sadly I watch as they remain ill themselves and live in terror of covid. It takes a massive switch of mind to go from wanting to learn medicine to seeing through the BS to actually want to cure people.</p>

        <p>Isn’t providing lesser care to anyone for any reason a violation of the Hippocratic oath? What assholes. I’ve seen some posts but haven’t really witnessed it myself. I did feel like I was being talked down to last time I had to go to the doctor for being unvaccinated but fuck Em. Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one. I hope they understand that life insurance companies won’t pay out if they croak from the vaccine because it is considered experimental.. idiots. I really hope things work out for you. We need people like you taking care of the rest of us free of judgement. Much love ❤️</p>

        <p>Thank you!!! I’m just so stressed over all of this and refuse to give in. Sometimes it feels like I’m the only one left with common sense and some brain cells.</p>
<p>I had to go to the doctor a month ago and was treated like garbage after they asked if I was “fully vaccinated” and I was like “uh you mean like all of my regular shots , yes..  covid, no”.  They dismissed my complaints and provided zero care and charged me $230 (I have a deductible plan but never go to the doctor so had to pay it). Absolutely absurd.</p>

        <p>If your employer mandates the influenza vaccine due to income from CMS(?) being tied to those vaccination rates, then they will likely mandate the Covid vaccine too. <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-final-rule-improves-health-equity-access-treatment-hospital-readiness-and-covid-19-vaccination">https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-final-rule-improves-health-equity-access-treatment-hospital-readiness-and-covid-19-vaccination</a></p>
<p>Texas just upheld a hospital's right to force vaccination, so Texas is not a good option as the gov there does NOT prohibit employers from forcing the vax. I think we are left with Florida and Wyoming at the moment.</p>

        <p>Most hospitals in Florida have mandated it already. I currently work in NJ, but got my nursing license in Florida recently as a back up in case NJ got too Covid crazy.  Almost every job posting in Florida states you need to be vaccinated so I wasted my time with that one.</p>
<p>If they mandate the flu, which most hospitals and nursing homes have for years, they're mandating the Covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>Oh god! You know I’ve been in healthcare since 2004.  Started as an EMT. Didn’t need the flu vaccine then. It was offered and I could just sign off that I was opting out. Suddenly it became mandatory.... it’s great you can “choose to work elsewhere” as they say, except when everyone is mandating the same thing you end up with the choice of paying your bills or being able to choose what happens to your body.</p>

        <p>Exactly. All these people saying you aren't being forced and you can just work somewhere else are clueless. Best bet is to go for an exemption. I am not affiliated with this site, but I did purchase the manual and I got an exemption. https://vaccinerights*removethis*.com/index.html</p>

        <p>Some places aren't even allowing medical or religious exemptions. Yes, it is illegal, but what good does "illegal" do you once you're been fired and then have to fight for your job back, and look for another job? You're just as unemployed</p>
<p>Look at the laws in your state (in the US) regarding vaccine requirements for school kids. Some states do NOT allow religious or personal philosophical exemptions. CA, MS, CT, ME, NY and WV allow neither a personal NOR religious exemption. If the laws governing school kids and vaccines translate to the workplace... then in these states, you can be certain that workers WILL be required to get the clot shot AND be denied unemployment benefits if they refuse.</p>

        <p>Yea, I remember back in nursing school they talk about being culturally sensitive. For example, jehovahs refuse blood transfusions. But that doesn’t mean I walk in and say “hey you’re a fucking moron we’re just going to leave you in your bed to die”.... you respect their wishes and try to do the best you can do help them get well without the transfusion.  Apparently now it’s ok just to tell people who don’t want the vaccine that you won’t treat them. So crazy</p>

        <p>Nurse in Texas. Can confirm mRNA is mandatory in most hospitals by 10/1 or terminated with no option for unemployment. Feels like a nightmare. Who will they replace us with?  Who will be healthy enough to care for patients when we know mRNA doesn’t give sterilizing immunity?  The ones already with vax- some - maybe 10% - keep calling in sick.

<p>Sacred Heart Hospital. Wonderful place and won't mandate anything. Pensacola cost of living is very very affordable. Like extremely. For a nurse, you'll be a top 5-10% earner in the area. Place is beautiful, cost of living is just low. </p>
<p>Tons of places to live and downtown is maybe 10 minutes from the hospital. With your income, you could live downtown. Which is about 10 minutes from the beach. </p>

        <p>Yep. I unsubbed from r/nursing. Just was so tired of the BS. I'm a Georgia RN. My hospital just mandated due to CMS and their medicare reimbursement. 40% of our nurses are not COVID vaccinated and several are protesting this. </p>
<p>If my exemption isn't approved I guess I'll be fired in 6 weeks. It's scary for sure but this is something I'm firmly decided on. I believe in freedom and the right for people to choose what goes into their body. The thought of giving in just because it's easier just makes me sick. </p>
<p>We live in crazy times. It's insane the level of censorship were facing especially with big tech and big pharma in bed with eachother at this point. I can't even describe how many times I've quoted vaccine/virus facts to some of my vaxxed friends and coworkers and them not caring or even acknowledging what I said. </p>

        <p>I work in a MICU as an RN. These people are full of shit. If you treated these patients any different on the basis of their vaccination status you would be fired on the spot. You don't just have free reign to be a shitty nurse. You have doctors and residents to answer to and aids and managers there to make sure everything is going ok. It's pure propaganda and not true at all. THE MAJORITY of our current covid patients in our ICU are fully vaccinated. We have had more young people come in for vaccine related injuries than we have for covid this entire time. It's blatant. Nurses aren't just some robotic subset of people that blindly do what they are told. Most look at this vaccine for what it is, an experimental vaccination being pushed in the most tyrannical way it can possibly be pushed. And the difference is we get a front row seat to see it failing people that put their faith in it. </p>
<p>Most of the nurses that I work work with haven't been vaccinated yet and plan on signing the vaccine waiver to get out of it.</p>

        <p>That’s great to know that many of your coworkers are refusing as well. </p>
<p>I previously worked ICU nights so I can definitely see where some nurses might just provide subpar care to be passive aggressive. I worked some real catty bitches though .... like they may do the bare minimum but ignoring call lights or maybe not changing a bedbound patients right away and just chatting at the nurses station instead. They’d do that anyway if they were just feeling lazy. Some of them were just terrible human beings which is why I left that setting. </p>
<p>I personally felt like the doctor I recently saw completely dismissed me after asking if I was fully vaccinated and I said no. I’ve been having lower right abdominal pain for months.  I almost never go to the doctor but finally caved and went to a GYN. I was worried it was something like an ovarian cyst or growth as it’s not going away, same spot, etc and she just didn’t even hear me. Asked how long it hurt for after I had just told her. Then did a quick exam and said everything looked fine. Charged me $230 for that. Maybe she just sucked anyway but I felt like as soon as I said I did not want the vaccine (after she asked) then she just sort of quickly rush me along and provided no help.</p>

<p>I'm sure you've seen these kinds of posts every so often where caregivers admit openly to treating patients abusively because of all sorts of things (politics, race, whatever). If they weren't exposed to the media, the employers would never know.</p>

        <p>So I suppose you're right. I work with some really awesome nurses most of whom having been nurses for well over 10-15 years and have seen some nurses get called every vile name in the book, seen CIWA patients openly tell nurses they were going to rape them and their children, seen patients spit on nurses and aids and the ones I know usually just let it roll off their shoulder and crack jokes about it to hold onto sanity, but typically have never heard anyone say "I hope this trump supporter anti vaxxer dies", but i have no doubts out there that there are some self absorbed, psychopathic health care workers that do.</p>

        <p>Nurse here. If they mandate a vaccine I quit. I deleted my messenger account because I don't want to debate with my ex nurse mates anymore. Everybody from my messenger chat group is following our governments bullshit, proudly testing newborns, anticipating in mass forced covid testing, posting pro vax propaganda and so on. I am sad and feeling ashamed to be a part of our healthcare system. I love to be a nurse and I meant to be a nurse because I love people in general and want to help them. But many of us are not helping people anynore. 
Stay strong fellow nurse. You are not alone in this💗</p>
