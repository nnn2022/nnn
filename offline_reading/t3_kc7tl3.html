    <strong>It's PAST time to ban junk food.</strong>
    <p><p>I was not really surprised to see that the number of obesity related deaths per year is estimated at 300,000. The more you know.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wvdhhr.org/bph/oehp/obesity/mortality.htm">And that was in 1991. I am sure the percentage of overweight and obese people has only gone up since then.</a></p>
<p>"According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco use. An estimated 300,000 deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic."</p>
<p>"Using data on all eligible subjects from all six studies, Allison et al. estimated that 280,184 obesity-attributable deaths occurred in the U.S. annually. When risk ratios calculated for nonsmokers and never-smokers were applied to the entire population (assuming these ratios to produce the best estimate for all subjects, regardless of smoking status, i.e., that obesity would exert the same deleterious effects across all smoking categories), the mean estimate for deaths due to obesity was 324,940. Additional analyses were performed controlling for prevalent chronic disease at baseline using data from the CPS1 and NHS. After controlling for preexisting disease, the mean annual number of obesity-attributable deaths was estimated to be 374,239 (330,324 based on CPS1 data and 418,154 based on NHS data)."</p></p>

        <p>Nah, people have a right to consume whatever they wish, even if its unhealthy. </p>
<p>Letting us allow the government to tell us what to eat would be just as foolish as what we are dealing with now with this whole mask mandate crap.</p>

        <p>This year, a lot of those are reclassed as COVID. When you hear stories of "healthy" people dying of it, it's a good bet they're in this category.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't bet on it and doctors have known for years that being obesity /= to being unhealthy on the merits.</p>
<p>In fact numerous doctors have been out and out saying it: That heart disease and other things that are 'linked to obesity' might not be linked to it, it is just that we look for it more often in people who are obese.</p>
<p>Plenty of right weight people dying of heart attacks due to congested arteries.</p>

        <p>No need to ban. Educate yes, but it’s like smoking or parachuting. You just automatically accept the risk when you choose the activity.  (Like leaving your home in a pandemic. Dont want the virus? Stay home, but that means you have to accept the risks involved with that choice. You can’t get away from risk no matter how you try!)</p>

        <p>Between working full time, even from home, and keeping up a house, having a few hobbies, etc, one thing I've never gotten any good at is healthy cooking. There are at least healthier prepared meals available now, but I always go for convenience in food. I want something quick to prepare that lasts for weeks in the fridge or freezer.</p>
<p>There are some delivery options but being in a rural area I can't use instacart or other grocery delivery services, they're just not here yet. Just frozen meal delivery services that will ship anywhere. The only fresh food I could have delivered is pizza/subs/etc.</p>
<p>My diet is basically a lot of snacks throughout the day and one full meal for supper. Nuts (usually almonds), bananas, granola bars, etc. Whatever I can grab and go right back to whatever I was doing. Lots of water and 2-3 cans of diet soda too. Not as bad as I used to be but boy do I wish I had a chef.</p>
