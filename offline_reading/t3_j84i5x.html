        <p>What kind of racist narcissistic drivel is this?  “White privilege?”  No one ever gave me anything for being white. I never got to walk into a bank, show my skin color, and walk out wealthy. </p>
<p>Everything I have I got for myself by fighting tooth and nail against everyone else who was fighting for the same thing. </p>
<p>I’m sick and tired of hearing about white privilege especially from”minority” politicians like AOC as she goes home to her house that costs way more than most Americans make in a year. </p>
<p>Look we have had a black president. We have female and minority politicians and billionaires. There is no white privilege. It’s simply a matter of growing up in the right family or fighting your way up when you’re born into the wrong families. I had to fight. Nothing was given to me.</p>

<p>The route to business recovery and growth post-COVID-19 must be coupled to sustainability, in order to create a fairer society for all.</p>
<p>Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman and Founder of the World Economic Forum, has defined today’s challenge as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">“The Great Reset” of capitalism</a>.  Indeed, how companies behave today will shape the way they – and business in general – will be perceived long after the crisis. There is little dispute among business leaders over the scale of the challenge or even the opportunities that could be unlocked as our economies begin to normalize, but there is no template on how to adjust to a post-pandemic world.</p>
<p>Post-pandemic world!? These clowns manufactured a " crisis " to implement draconian changes and thought nobody would pay attention? The covid and lockdown hoax narrative is falling apart fast, we are starting to defeat them through lawsuits and soon enough, voting!</p>
<p>The goal of this great reset bullshit and I quote: to impoverish the non-technocratic middle class, to acclimate the population to major increases in global surveillance (biometric, contact  tracing, etc.), to transfer health decisions from individual doctors to the State, and greatly advance the progress toward the One World Government - where the vast majority don't get to use any carbon energy, like heat or transport fuel, because, well, "Global Warming".</p>
