    <strong>Got an anwser about hospitalization rates.</strong>
    <p><p>There is an ask the expert thread in my countries subreddit and someone who claimed they are technical health worker anwsered questions.They use tor+vpn to  remain anonymous and protect their job.</p>
<p>I asked the following question :How does the current extra burden on hospitals compare to flu season?</p>
<p>Answer: During the flu it is little bit more but insignificant compared to current.</p>
<p>It is reliable information?</p></p>

        <p>Personally I think this virus has caused more hospitalizations but I think the response has been disproportionate and the money we spent locking down would have been better spent on supporting those at most risk and investing in our health systems. This shows that it's not about helping people but a power grab by those in charge. Flattening the curve in no way actually helps the most vulnerable, only prolongs the pain for everybody. Why did they send the infected back the the old folks homes? "We didn't think about it" was the uk answer when the most vulnerable were known from the very beginning. Bullshit or totally unacceptable. Its a bad flu year, it's just that people are not able to accept  that it means deaths. There is a good chance that poor political and medical interventions caused more deaths than necessary.</p>

        <p>The problem is that this flu was uncommonly lethal to people over 60.</p>
<p>Including my own parents who Mom was healthier than me and by the merits, I should have been the turned into cremains and not her.</p>
<p>Something about how this virus works stinks. We have never had a coronavirus that was this damned chaotic in whom it targeted for sickening seriously.</p>
<p>Remember: We had literal bodybuilders in the best shape of their lives having to be put on ventilators. That is not normal.</p>

        <p>The average age of covid deaths is higher than the normal age of death in the uk. Isolated cases do not prove a rule.</p>

        <p>Body builders often take steroids which suppresses the immune system so it's actually NOT surprising they are vulnerable to covid.</p>

        <p>In my county in California, we have had 85  covid hospitalizations, and 9 deaths, <strong>total</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, we have 5 covid patients in hospital, including 1 in ICU.</strong></p>
<p>The county has admitted to letting (currently) 140 covid positive people "self-quarantine" at home, presumably with their families, who visit grocery stores etc to stay fed. How does that affect community transmission rates?</p>
<p>We are in another lockdown based on "infection cases", despite hosp. and death rates being extremely low. <strong>We havent had a covid death here in 3 months.</strong></p>
<p>Yet, its the antimaskers who get blamed for continued community spread, and increased lockdown measures.</p>

        <p>The issue is the massive backlog of people who weren't able to go in for scheduled surgeries, missed diagnoses and screenings, undetected early stage cancers and heart problems which are now in the later stages and can't be ignored. This is the big issue. By clearing out these hospitals, other and more serious long-term issues have been ignored that are essentially ticking time bombs that require eventual hospitalization due to neglect of early intervention. </p>
<p>Secondly, - <strong>only 10% of icu admissions are covid patients:</strong> https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-capacity#hospital-utilization - and this includes patients who are there for other reasons but happen to test positive for covid upon entry although they are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>In Miami: </p>
<p>https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article247234864.html) </p>
<p>and Toronto : </p>
<p>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-almost-half-of-kids-in-hospital-with-covid-19-were-admitted-for-other/ </p>
<p>... there are articles that say that about half of covid patients admitted are there for other reasons. </p>
<p>So if we take away half from the 10% icu admissions that leaves us on average with about 5% actual covid admissions to ICU's. So with flus absolutely vanishing off the map this year and it being flu season, I would hazard a guess that things are fairly normal for this time of year as hospitals are often at 85% percent capacity on a normal year and people don't realized that.</p>
<p>EDIT: Or if anything, they are slightly busier due to backlog issues and not covid, and that is a lockdown issue, not a virus overwhelming hospitals one.</p>
