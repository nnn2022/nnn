    <strong>COVID Math</strong>
    <p><p>This post is primarily directed towards the CV19 vax advocates + doomers hanging around on this sub. Would like to hear the rational for truly anyone under the age of 60 getting the vaccine. From what i have read they claim the vax is 95% effective and “safe”. Do i believe that figure is correct or they are truly safe, certainly not. But for sake of conversation let’s just say those are both factual. 
Natural immunity for ages 0-19 provides a 99.97% survival rate 
Natural immunity for 20-49 provides a 99.98% survival rate 
Natural immunity for ages 50-69 provides 99.5% survival rate 
Natural immunity for 70+ sees largest drop to 94.6%. The only age group who’s figure comes in below the mark of the supposed efficacy of the vax. Though i am not personally a proponent for MRNA gene therapy on any age bracket, i suppose from a strictly numbers perspective, it’s most logical for this and only this age group. Also per the CDC 6% of CV cases were the sole cause of death. I should also point out that the average death due to covid is higher than that of the typically life span of someone in the US.
Next, the counter arguments from these people is we need to reach Herd immunity for those at risk or the other sub sect I’ve seen cited is for those who can’t get the vaccine. I won’t comment on the “those who can’t get the vaccine” as i have read enough from reputable doctors that believe MRNA gene therapy can have devastating health effects. Though have all been promptly silenced. I will comment though on attempting to reach Herd immunity for these at risk groups. Why were young healthy people locked down for a year straight? When real science would suggest allowing individuals to roam who will not die of the virus is the most effective way to reach this goal. 
The next false counter argument I’ve seen is that somehow vax immunity is superior. There is a reason for those blank spots on your vax card they are for the boosters you will need or for the next made up strain. I know i have had antibodies for over a year and know others who do as well through natural infection and have yet to be reinfected . While i do know several people who have received both doses of vax and still contracted. Those who received vax and still contracted were also avid double maskers.
Though I feel like i have checked off most topics of conversation, I’m sure someone will still try and pin me as “anti science” and endangering grandma.
That being said, this sub has given me hope that there are others out there who have seen though this facade and kept a relatively positive outlook on life as a whole.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccines Pfizer and moderna have around a 95% relative risk reduction which they tout as efficacy and fool people such as yourself. In reality, the absolute risk reduction is approximately 1% for both companies. They fail to report this for obvious reasons. Furthermore, their numbers can hardly be believed when they didn’t even confirm all suspected covid cases.</p>

<p>So I personally feel the obsession and urgency to get everyone vaccinated is dumb, but here is a way I could in theory justify the push for getting everyone vaccinated.</p>
<p>This whole mess has lasted as long as it has, not because of the most extreme doomers, but rather the more Luke warm doomers closer to the middle. And this is a very large group of people, many of which are quite influential. These people do actually want things to go back to normal, but they have dug them so far down the covid hole that they are incapable of just letting go and doing a full 180. There is so much pressure within their social circles to maintain the seriousness of covid, that they have basically forced themselves into a position where they believe that the only way out is through mass vaccinations. Now, obviously they are wrong, and have been manipulated, but at this point the wrongness of their position doesn't really matter. The reality is that in order for things to ever go back to normal, this group must be appeased. Once they feel comfortable, the extreme doomers will have no allies, and will be a small, insignificant minority unable to really influence policy. Unfortunately, having a large majority of people vaccinated (70% ish) is the only thing that will make this middle group feel comfortable. So it comes down to - do you stick to your guns and not get vaccinated based on principle and not giving in to their demands? Or do you just give in and get the vaccine that is most likely perfectly safe, and may help you not get that sick in the future, just so these people can feel like the they got a win, and can let the world go back to normal?</p>
<p>Now as someone who feels like the hype around this vaccine is dumb, I will always respect those who stick to their principles and don't give into the pressure. But I do think that an argument can be made that people just giving in and getting the vaccine might actually help get things back to normal. Now, it's hard not to think that the goal posts will always continue to be moved by those that will never be satisfied, but there is part of me that does think that this could actually be the last thing needed for things to go back to normal.</p>

        <p>I do not agree with some of the way the governments have handled the pandemic, but I am a firm believer of the necessity of vaccinations for all age groups. It is true that if we would only vaccinate the weak, we could probably get this virus under controll, but unfortunately not every weak individual is able to get vaccinated. For instance people who are in chemotherapy, or people who have received an organ transplant, lack the ability to create immunity due to their severely damaged or disabled immune systems. So for them we should aim for herd immunity. </p>
<p>Another reason we should all get vaccinated is the risk that the virus evolves into a strain which is resistant to the immunity created by vaccinations. Every time a virus duplicates itself, many mutations occur. Most of these mutations will do nothing, but after mutating a lot, viruses could differ so much from their original strain that it would not be recognized by our immune systems. If more people get vaccinated, the virus will spread less and the amount of mutations that occur will reduce. This, in turn, will reduce the chances of evolving in to different strains which vaccinated people have no immunity against. </p>
<p>TLDR
Some people cannot get vaccinated and they need to be safe from te virus as well. And the more people are vaccinated, the less likely there will occur mutations which will render previously achieved immunity less effective.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to your comment on these points</p>

        <p>A person with natural immunity from infection would not benefit from a vaccination.
Vaccinated people can still be infected and can still transmit it.... how are these people helping people with weak immune systems? 
People with weak immunity or going through treatments need to take THEIR OWN precautions and not expect everyone around them to change behavior. Anyone who thinks it's reasonable to demand others mask up or get an experimental injection is an asshole.</p>

        <p>Over before they are contagious? If they have viral lead in their lungs and cough or sneeze they have the potential to spread it... and from what they say, you get about 6 days of it (instead of 2 weeks) and probably won't need a ventilator and you will probably live....they hope... hope is all they really have because of lack of data. The words the spokesperson for Pfizer was using definitely suggested you would be infectious if you contracted it and viral load increased.</p>

        <p>Theoretically you could infect other people if you have only 1 virus particle in your body, but the chances will be way lower than if you had a million. Vaccinations increase the rapidity of detecting the virus and initiating the immune response. This will significantly lower the amount of virus particles in someone's body at the peak of infection, which will significantly lower the chances of infecting others. After being sufficiently vaccinated, the chances of infection others is so low that those persons are practically not contagious.</p>

        <p>:) what a stretch.... if it's just a particle that can be coughed out it isn't an infection or disease... its going to be millions of viral particles that get sprayed to pass it on. Even then the viral package needs to stay moist and the right temp... then it actually has to come into contact with an appropriate cell.... in the real world, one particle is unlikely to infect.</p>

        <p>My point exactly. A person with just a few particles cannot infect others. Vaccinations cause less particles to be formed and be available to infect others. Thus, vaccinations work against the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>Vaccinations don't cause less particles, as such... they lessen the time you are sick. All the time you're sick though,  youre infectious... its a shitty product that hardly works at all, which the manufacturers should be embarrassed to bring to market, frankly.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your ability to disagree and converse still. But i think we have some fundamental disagreements on immunity sources. I will always favor natural immunity as the body self regulates a T cell response to these viruses making it effective against all strains, something vax simply cant do. Nor do i agree with MRNA vaccination as a whole, nor would i advocate for vaccination during the middle of an “outbreak”. My point re: letting healthy people roam runs a parallel to your “more people getting vaccinated”. I simply think the simpler and more reasonable alternative is as stated: let more young people outside, they get infected, don’t get overly ill or die, create immunity and mitigates the possibility of becoming resistant to strains through vax immunization.</p>

        <p>Vaccinations activate the immune system the same way a natural infection does, which means that there will still be a T cell response, otherwise T memory cells would not be created and immunity would not be achieved. I do believe that natural immunity is more effective against different strains. It is just really hard, maybe even impossible, to keep the weak and the free roaming youth separated long enough for natural herd immunity to occur. Vaccinations will just speed up this process a little</p>

        <p>The vaccines will push virus to mutate in a way that natural immunity would not.  Much like how use and over-use of antibiotics helps to create super bugs which are drug resistant, like mrsa.  So when the spike protein on sars-cov-2 mutates sufficently, the vaccine will be obsolete, while natural immunity which was exposed to the whole virus and a multitude of virus id’ing epitopes will still be able to recognize and defend against the mutations(ie variants)</p>

        <p>Natural infection indeed creates immunity for a wider variety of strains, but that still is not a reason to not get vaccinated. The vaccine will not push the virus to mutate. The more people that are vaccinated, the less the virus will duplicate it self. And because mutations are caused during duplications, this wil mean less mutations. The way how antibiotics helped to create super bugs has nothing to do with viruses and vaccinations. If a person uses antibiotics insufficiently and quits the use before all of the bacteria are killed, a few of the stronger, more resistant bacteria will survive. These bacteria will then duplicate themselves into a new bacteria which all posses the resistant traits. Do this a couple more times and you get super bugs. Since the immunity caused by vaccinations will prevent people from being a host for the virus, instead of killing of the weaker viruses, mutations will not originate in the same way.</p>

        <p>The vaccine does not prevent infection or eliminate the virus. It simply increases the immune system’s ability to fight it, reducing symptoms and all but eliminating mortality(allegedly) and therefore viral load and transmissibility.  Plenty of evolutionary “space” for mutations and natural selection- more in the case of the mRNA vaccines since they are thusfar monochromatically focused on one single epitope; the spike protein whereas those of us with infection induced immunity saw whole virus and a multitude of virus identifying epitopes.</p>
