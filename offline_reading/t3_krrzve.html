    <strong>Can i have a civil discussion with you?</strong>
    <p><p>I see many posts saying that covid is just a rebranded seasonal flu because flu cases are abnormally low this year.</p>
<p>I think that the flu cases are so low because of all the restrictions, lockdowns and other things, and because many people wear a mask, try not to be too close to eachother and wash their hands more often. That's it. </p>
<p>Please don't attack I'm just saying...</p></p>

        <p>My counter to that is, if masks, restrictions, and lockdowns are so effective then why are <em>Covid</em> cases surging? Why would Covid spread like wildfire, but not the flu? Even if Covid was the mOsT cOnTaGiOuS eVeR, you'd think wearing masks and social distancing, and even the lockdowns that have been implemented would curb it to <strong>some</strong> extent.</p>
<p>Does that make sense to you, OP? Think about it.</p>

        <p>I can't find the article I saw a couple of days ago on here, but think on this:</p>
<p>CDC (IIRC) is now lumping pneumonia, influenza, and Rona deaths together under the category "PIC". Ergo flu cases are "non-existent" because they are being lumped in with Rona to inflate "case numbers".</p>
<p>It's all a scam to keep the panic going.</p>

        <p>You make a good point. Even so, as someone who knows people who have had covid and even died from it in some cases, I feel like this has all gone too far. In the name of saving every last person, we have kind of made life miserable for everyone. Everything worth doing to enjoy life is restricted or banned at the moment, with no clear end in sight. How many more events and experiences must people miss out on? How many birthday parties, holidays, graduations have to be lost? It seems trivial at first, but imagine being a young person who is missing out on life. A whole year gone, and who knows if this one will be gone too.</p>
<p>My aunt died of cancer the other day. I can't afford to miss the weeks of work necessary for quarantine in order to be at her funeral.</p>
<p>I'm madly in love with a woman in another country, but I can't visit her until who knows when.</p>
<p>Should we be taking precautions? Of course. But in my opinion, the things we're doing to ourselves will have consequences that will outlast this plague for years to come.</p>

        <p>That's a good point.  So can you explain why in Sweden, where they have few restrictions and few wear masks, influenza is also down to almost nothing?</p>
<p>Not only is the flu almost gone but parainfluenza and RSV are nearly non existent this year as well.  Why do you think that is if they have the same R0 transmission rate as COVID or perhaps a little higher?</p>

<p>Flu didn't suddenly disappear, it's just that this season was relatively mild. It's not that flu season is always massive</p>

        <p>I do except that the corona is more virulent but it is not more deadly than the flu, I think they are on the same playing field and with "mutations" that theory is more and more accurate</p>

        <p>I have never said that it's a mortal disease which will kill you instantly and the numbers show it, the problem it's high contagiousness, if it manages to infect a large number of people I wont matter that the chance to die is very slim, a large number of people will die. Also with more and more beds in the hospital taken by patients with severe covid symptoms are negated to other people with other diseases which may not have a chance to be cured thus provoking more deaths unrelated to covid, all the other viruses, cancers and diseases still exist.</p>

        <p>In one sentence you contradict yourself in your post "the problem it's high contagiousness, if it manages to infect a large number of people I wont matter that the chance to die is very slim, a large number of people will die" </p>
<p>If it is highly contagious and infects a large number of people and you mention that number is slim, then how will a large amount of people die when 99.7% recover just fine? I do agree with you on other diseases going untreated because hospitals don't except patients are are non-corona</p>

        <p>Ok let's say  that in 100 people get infected and the 1% dies, that's not a lot</p>
<p>Not imagine 100.000 people getting infected, that 1% is much higher than the 1% of the other group</p>
<p>And then there's people with other health problems that may die so the percentage is going to be higher than 1%</p>
<p>The thing I don't understand is that many people are saying: well people with health problems did this to themselves let's just let them die, sorry but that just seems killing the un-perfect part of the population.</p>
<p>Not talking about you, but I saw many saying this.</p>

        <p>I can understand what you're saying, the higher number in the group the 1% of deaths would be higher, ok fine I'll take that... but the rate of 1% death rate still does not change or even increase, the same can be said about the flu, before all of this were you aware that the flu kills so many in a given year? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you were aware of it but might not have known the exact number because that is never reported to the public, it is mentioned online if you look for it, but it's not an 'in your face' number. What about other deaths like obesity, heart disease, smoking (second hand smoking) those kill at a monstrosity of a death rate, why do those take a back seat and only deaths from corona are being focused on or even seem to matter now?</p>

        <p>Eeeh I can't explain that I'll admit it, health is a big business expecially in the USA I can't deny it, that's why I prefer the free healthcare in my country. But right now the major concern is the coronavirus expecially because it's hitting everyone's personal life unlike obesity and smoking.</p>

        <p>Again that's a logical fallacy, how does obesity or smoking not effect everyone's personal life? If you smoked near me every single day and I have a case of secondhand smoke, I would literally be in bad shape and could die from it, there are about 200k+ secondhand smoke deaths in the US</p>

        <p>My approach is on a different layer:</p>
<p>You can't know if any of their outrageous claims are true at all, because you have no way to reproduce or verify any of them yourself.</p>
<p>It's all based on faith in the experts (and ridicule and bullying against those who don't blindly believe) and the lie of the good heartened politicians - who only want to protect you - but who are the exact same people who send armed thugs after you to cage you if you have green crumbles in your cigarette - or if you don't pay them what they demand you must hand over to them according to them. </p>
<p>And if you resist the armed thugs they will escalate their severe violence even more and eventually openly murder you. Why do you trust people who literally enslave you - and even to an absolutely ridiculous degree?</p>
<p>And don't you find it a bit suspicious that every single "crisis" always has further enslavement and restrictions for the masses as "solutions"? Doesn't this give them every incentive to make up as many crises as possible to grab the most power?</p>
