    <strong>My experience in Mexico</strong>
    <p><p>Just thought I would share my experience (in terms of COVID restrictions) in Mexico in case anyone is interested in escaping to somewhere relatively sane, and also because I've heard a lot of mixed things about Mexico. I've been in San CristÃ³bal de las Casas (state of Chiapas) for a few weeks. I'm not sure, but I've heard that most of Mexico is very much into hygiene theater (masks everywhere including outside, temperature checks, sanitizer, etc.) along with some restrictions on businesses. It varies by state though. I've heard that Tulum and CancÃºn (state of Quintana Roo) are pretty relaxed, but I haven't been there yet. I'll just talk about SCDLC/Chiapas in this post.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-Airport/flight experience is pretty similar to anywhere else, although no test is required. To get to SCDLC I flew from CDMX to Tuxtla GutiÃ©rrez which is an hour from SCDLC.</p>
<p>-As soon as I stepped out of TG airport there were two taxi drivers chatting without masks. I got into a taxi and neither of us wore masks. That was a nice start. I got a couple of other taxis and didn't wear a mask although the driver wore a mask in one case.</p>
<p>-Outside about half of people wear masks. Too much for my liking, but at least you're not required to wear one (maybe there's a rule, but it's not enforced if there is one) and since a lot of people don't wear it, you won't feel anxious for being the only one. It also varies a bit in different areas or at different times. I've heard that the Indians/indigenous people don't really care much about COVID. It seems to be true as far as I can tell (generalizing obviously). For example, there is an indigenous market where almost no one wears masks.</p>
<p>-In the gym I go to almost no one wears masks (including staff).</p>
<p>-I've been to nearly 10 restaurants and never wore a mask. Some people wear it when they walk in and then take it off, then put it on again when they get up from their table. I don't bother with that, even if they have a mask sign up. The staff usually wear masks (maybe 80%). They took my temperature and asked me to use sanitizer in one restaurant, but not in any of the others.</p>
<p>-I wore a mask in my hotel because they had a mask sign up. But I noticed some guests didn't wear it, so I stopped wearing it and the staff didn't mind (they usually wear it, but they pull it up and down a lot).</p>
<p>-I go to a Spanish school and almost no one wears masks. Maybe a specific student will wear it and their teacher will wear if the student wants it.</p>
<p>-I took a tour and wore a mask on the bus because everyone else was wearing it and I presumed it was mandatory. I took it off as soon as I got outside.</p>
<p>-Supermarkets (particularly OXXO chain) will require you to wear a mask and probably take your temperature and use sanitizer. However you can avoid this (depending on what you need) by going to smaller shops or outdoor markets where you usually don't need to wear a mask and often the staff don't wear them either, and they generally don't require temperature checks/sanitizer.</p>
<p>-Everything seems to be open. I'm not really a big "nightlife" person but walking around at 10 pm, there's a lot of life in the streets.</p>
<p>-People are generally relaxed about COVID. While some people wear masks, they don't seem to care if other people don't. "Social distancing" isn't really a thing here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's about it. I escaped from a country that went absolutely insane. It's nice being able to live a pretty normal life where people aren't terrified of each other. It's a nice city (apart from the graffiti), the people are friendly, the food is good, there's a lot of nature nearby and it's quite cheap.</p></p>

        <p>My friend went to Cozumel and says the hygiene theater there was ridiculous.  Their luggage was sprayed when they arrived (with what I donâ€™t know,) as was their hotel room, daily.  Masks at all times, everywhere, even in cars.  They were maskless in their car one day and a cop followed them, pulled them over and told them to put on their masks.  She says you get three days in jail for violations of hygiene/distancing policy.  </p>
<p>No way am I ever going there until this all stops.  She says their resort was a ghost town.  Wait till they figure out that all this theater is scaring people away and it isnâ€™t doing anything productive anyway.</p>
