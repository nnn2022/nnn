    <strong>Did cern mess with the timeline? How did we get in this authoritarian/communist/clown world?</strong>
    <p><p>Just a decade ago things weren't like this. Now we are in this clown world where old Marxist tactics are being used and everything feels inverted and politically correct now. The culture has also changed a lot since about 2012-2015.</p></p>

        <p>OK so if you have seen the work done by Terrence Mcenna, Graham Hancock, ET Al or the interview with the Navy guy talking about project looking glass you will have some understanding about the situation we are now in.</p>
<p>The time lines were due to coalesce in 2012. But I am not sure whether they did or didn't.apparently the situation was inevitable no matter what course of action was taken, same outcome, every time. No escape kind of thing. It is possible that CERN has altered something or that we are now living out an alternate time line. Mandela effects have become increasingly noticeable and hundreds of synchronicities have occurred beyond reasonable acceptance in normal reality. So yes, things are now different. Have you noticed? , well done, you are awake. If you have not and want to leave an un informed ad hom then be my guest. </p>
<p>Whatever the situation, we are in unchartered territory. Bidens hands go through microphones, suez canal gets blocked by collision deemed accidental, vaccines approved in days and pushed like heroin, people made prisoners in their own home and some even like it, robot wars lands on Mars allegedly and sends back some videos for us to watch, are you hearing this? And the lord god Elon controls us all with his tweets. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. But it was definitely the times, not the time we had before 2012.</p>

        <p>Yes, i've done research on all of that. Project looking glass is hard to believe but i don't know how else to explain what is going on lol. Things are just....weird/off now. At least to me. But it doesn't seem like anyone else is noticing or cares, or is awake, or whatever you want to call it. I think most of the mandela effects are BS, but who am i to judge? If we did shift realities then i can't just tell someone else they are wrong. There are a few that stick out to me though</p>
<p>The statue of liberty being on Liberty Island 
No cornucopia on fruit of the loom logo
Moonraker</p>
<p>None of those make any sense to me. I am almost positive they were different when i was younger. </p>
<p>And i've also noticed a lot of synchronicities lately. Things that were not happening or noticeable before 2015 for me. So how does it keep happening? Have they always been there or am i just starting to wake up/notice them? I just can't see the latter being possible but who knows. I do know for a fact though that the culture is completely different than pre 2015. There was a huge shift around 2015-2017 and it's been clownish every since.</p>
<p>Also i don't consume any mainstream media. I quit in 2015. Which correlates exactly to the time period i started noticing all of this stuff.</p>

        <p>Maybe you were consuming the same indoctrination as everyone else before so you were on the same page. Now you’ve become decalibrated and are instead more connected with actual reality so you experience synchronicities. You were just too entangled in the absurdity before to notice how dumb it was.</p>

        <p>Yeah i agree with what he said. 2017 is when i really started noticing all of this too. He mentioned that nobody does the peace sign anymore too. There are a lot of little things like that that changed tbh. People used to say chea and other dumb stuff back in the day too but you never hear it anymore.</p>

        <p>So that kid is really interesting and I have seen theories of thus kind before. I also like looking into how things are presented to us because I think that always has something to do with either the universe itself or the controlling factors such as the elite which are responsible for overseeing the production and presentation of information.</p>
<p>In this case two things really stand out.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The article is written in such a way as to steer their audience in the direction that thus is just a crackpot kid with a mad idea. This is absolutely to be expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most interesting thing is the alleged name of the child. Max Laughin. Now this may have escaped the attention of some but if you look back at many false flag events and mefia fakery, you will find a catalog of ridiculous names. So here we have Max Laughin, which is phonetically identical to max, short for maximum laughing. I. E this is a joke right? But the thing about this reality is that it is fu of inversion, so the Max Laughin might be trying to make us think this is a joke, but is actually a glimpse of the truth.</p>
