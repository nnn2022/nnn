    <strong>Besides proper nutrition and exercise, there is a huge, largely ignored factor in preserving and re-enforcing our natural immune system: the symbiotic relationship we have with the microbiomes our bodies contain.</strong>
    <p><p>Big pharma and their partners in the class of plutocrats that fancy themselves to be our owners intentionally obscure this fact. It is evidenced by their complete blacklisting of lyctic bacteriophages, naturopathic medicine, and lack of promotion or discussion in general about maintaining a healthy personal microbiome. </p>
<p>I highly recommend that anyone interested in learning more about the things I mention read further:
1)"The art of fermentation" by sandor elix Katz, a living testament to the efficacy of this theory in the form of a 30+ year survivor of hiv
2)read about the eliava Institute in the Republic of Georgia, and what they produce (and have since the 1st world war)
3) look into what the ingredients of major pharma products that actually work and don't have a million side effects are. For starters, did you know that Tamiflu is made from the concentrated extract of star anise? Don't feel bad, most people dont</p>
<p>Please, for those that like to read and are actually interested in maintaining their own health without the interference, meddling, and manipulation of the evil behind the push for medical tyranny- read on these things, and be well.</p></p>

        <p>I take non-dairy probiotics and 4000 IU vitamin D3 supplements daily to boost my immune system. </p>
<p>I also practice mindfulness and meditation to keep stress, anxiety and depression at minimum.</p>

        <p>Both of those things are wonderful, and the connection between maintaining a healthy mental state in order to maximize physical health is another thing that is heavily downplayed by the ptb as well, and less than a coincidence the the mental heath of us all is very literally under constant heavy attack at this time by the same forces by physiological and psychotronic means. The one thing they can't have control of is our own individual wills, unless we cede it to them, and this drives them crazy. </p>
<p>Being that you are not a new initiate to the ideas that I am expressing, I do invite you to learn more about lyctic bacteriophages. They may yet be available in your country, not to profile, but your username looks hindi to me, and I know that besides republic of Georgia and Russian federation, India did have them available over the counter not too long ago, and may yet...
Phages used to be available over the counter here in the usa also, but big pharma had made them completely unavailable by the 1970s because they are naturally occurring viruses that are not pathogenic to humans, but instead kill bacteria relentlessly. For every family of bacterium, there exists a phage in nature that specifically preys on that family of bacteria, and thus does not damage the helpful bacterium that exist in our bodies in a natural and necessary mutualistic balance. The fact that they cannot be patented and only need to be isolated and concentrated (not super complicated to do) was the major factor in their exclusion from the market in the usa and much of the world by pharma players that preferred to sell their antibiotics. </p>
<p>Only recently have they had a re-kindled interest in western medicine, due to the growing emergence of antibiotic resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria, like staph turning into mrsa. But due to their limited availability here now, they are doing all they can to completely pirate the limited use authorization they now have. Really sickening.</p>
