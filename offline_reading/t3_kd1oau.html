        <p>One of my Facebook friends spent all of March making fun of people wearing cloth masks and bandannas over their faces because they were useless. Now he spends all his time shaming people for not wearing cloth masks. </p>
<p>At some point in April, the entire narrative literally did a 180 and for some reason, no one noticed nor cared. Fauci went from telling us not to wear masks to telling us we were killing people by not wearing them. At the time, they claimed that they had initially lied in the interest of preserving PPE for all first responders, but that doesn't make sense because cloth masks are not PPE and everyone could make them out of materials they had at home or order them from online. So why did it happen? There weren't any medical studies that came out that proved masks helped, in fact the general medical concensus was that masks didn't help. I'm still trying to figure out what caused a majority of public figures to completely reverse course and how they managed to convince a majority of the population that they needed to do the exact opposite of what they had been saying mere weeks before. </p>
<p>This is just one of the many, many, many things that don't add up about this whole debacle.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it stinks to high hell, and is a curse of being like us: we remember shit, and want REAL reasons for the change, not some contrived smoothed-over retconned horseshit.</p>
<p>That whole 180 was very mysterious. To me it's clear somebody(s) higher up ordered the change, and the entire media, political, and medical apparatus fell into line over night. And while it seems clear that people like Gates and Schwab have had an explicit agenda ever since October of last year (Event 201), it's not clear why they would have withheld that information from people like Fauci, who was very plugged into that whole matrix of nefarious assholes. Was he waiting on the check to clear, or what?</p>

        <p>I do know that at first, facial recognition systems weren't good at picking up masked faces, and then there was a report that they had improved. That could have something to do with it, which is really sinister.</p>

        <p>The other side will say “it’s because we learned more and realized masks do help. Science is ever changing and this is a novel virus”. All the same BS as usual. No science changed here, masks are as they’ve always been it’s not like we’ve had some brand new one come out that fends off everything. No, the only thing that changed was the realization that people were more easily controlled than they realized and that they could mandate this to exert more control.</p>

        <p>Byambasuren’s review also found that asymptomatic individuals were 42% less likely to transmit the virus than symptomatic people.</p>
<p>One reason that scientists want to know how frequently people without symptoms transmit the virus is because these infections largely go undetected. Testing in most countries is targeted at those with symptoms.</p>
<p>As part of a large population study in Geneva, Switzerland, researchers modelled viral spread among people living together. In a manuscript posted on medRxiv this month2, they report that the risk of an asymptomatic person passing the virus to others in their home is about one-quarter of the risk of transmission from a symptomatic person.</p>
<p>Although there is a lower risk of transmission from asymptomatic people, they might still present a significant public-health risk because they are more likely to be out in the community than isolated at home, says Andrew Azman, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, who is based in Switzerland and was a co-author on the study. “The actual public-health burden of this massive pool of interacting ‘asymptomatics’ in the community probably suggests that a sizeable portion of transmission events are from asymptomatic transmissions,” he says.</p>
<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03141-3</p>
<p>So while asymptomatic people are less likely, they still do infect people</p>
<p>As well the general public and the scientific community believes in asymptomatic spreading of the virus, so you should be proving to me that it doesnt exist</p>

        <p>The best is how the official narrative is that they all coordinated and conspired to lie to us because there was a mask shortage. Ok so you're admitting you don't think very highly of us and are willing to lie to us about public health matters. Why exactly should we continue to believe anything you say?</p>

        <p>Yeah, if masks do work then why isn't there collective outrage about how people were pretty much purposefully infected? I lived in Chicago in March/April and we were packed into the grocery like sardines. Peak infection scenario. </p>

        <p>They (the elites) pulled a reverse psychology. They knew if they said masks don't work that people would scramble to get the masks and wear them. Then when people started buying up the masks the narrative changed. </p>

        <p>Uh, the science has changed. 6 months ago the science all said that masks did nothing. Now the science says masks do everything. We just follow the science, unlike you dumb conservatards /sarcasm. It just so happens that there were major breakthroughs in mask research, the prevailing wisdom of decades just so happened to do a 180 degree flip in August 2020.</p>
