        <p>Here’s what I think: </p>
<p>Covid has made the wealthy even more wealthy. Big pharma and people like Bill Gates are trying to get absolute control over us. In the US at least, Covid was brought here to get Trump out of office. The media sides with whatever’s gonna get them clicks, so they are siding left. In the end it all comes down to money and control, but mainly money. Think of all the money big pharma is making right now. Pfizer, Moderna, and all of those companies and their workers are wiping their butts with $100 bills. </p>
<p>It was never about a virus, it was about control and money. They want endless lockdowns for control and endless booster shots for money. They LOVE it. We signed up for none of this BS. We need to fight for our future and for our kids’ future. Would you want your kids to live in this world? I certainly wouldn’t. Should we have to fight for our freedom in the “land of the free and home of the brave”? No. But now we do so lets get on it and reverse as much of this crap as possible</p>

        <p>The other subreddits are full of egotistical tribes who value obedience, submission and idol worship vs freedom, asking questions and following intuition.  The hypocrisy, virtue signaling and just plain abuse I’ve seen just bc someone has a different viewpoint is astounding. We are a group of thinkers, analyzers, questioners and researchers who value the freedom of living outside of a determined box, making personal choices and living life without an agenda being shoved down our throats. We live life to the fullest, no regrets, because we know a life that’s heavily monitored, controlled and scrutinized is not a life worth living.</p>

        <p>The thing is right, this pandemic everyone here probably has no agreement on the origin of it. If it's planned, lab leak, naturally jumped from animals to humans. We can toss this aside as we'll probably not know for certain ad that has been shown to have originated in China where they have a tight grip on things coming I'm and out of the country. The below is I think the most biggest issues or main talking points</p>
<p>1) It's people choice to take the vaxx or anything into the body (injection or tablets, whatever) or not and we shouldn't be held hostage because of it. If we don't want to take it why shut us out for the most basic social needs?</p>
<p>2) with regards to mrna vaxx it is experimental and there are no long term studies yet for it. I'm aware mrna has been use for cancer patients and for maybe about a decade now but having it made for this pandemic and injected on millions of people I think is not right. I get it's a pandemic and it was rushed but naturally we don't want the cure to be bigger than the first problem ( goes for anything in life) but it seems it's bigger problem than the virus itself.</p>
<p>3) there is no scientific evidence (that I've seen) masking and lockdowns draft or control the covid pandemic. The evidence is quite clear it doesn't. Vaxxed and masked people can also get infected.</p>
<p>4) no liability from big pharma.</p>
<p>5) it seems to be proven the vaxx is not as good as advertised. Whether you vaxx or not you can still catch it, spread and potentially anyone can die from it. Individuals react different to vax or covid a lot of factors come into play but that doesn't mean  we should all be punished for it. People want to work, live life have joy in the outside world despite trials we face collectively in our home planet.</p>
<p>And finally what we don't stand for is the gradual stripping of our freedoms, over the top surveillance and censorship. This is a huge one because even if it said to be temporary (however long the duration of covid) it will be harder to reverse it and you can damn well be sure the governments will try everything to prolong these measures they put in place for as long as possible or permenant. We like most people he live in a democracy where we accept all kinds of people of race, religion  or no religion, disability etc only to be shunned out of society for valid medical concerns and stances. Freedom isn't free and if we going to earn it again...we will earn it again. Freedom is rightfully ours including yours if you disagree or don't realise what you're losing. this isn't about the virus. Why is Freedom hard to get back despite trials and hardships in our world???</p>

        <p>We just want people to live their lives how they feel. As in if people want to wear a mask then they are free to. If someone wants to take the vaccine then they are free to. </p>
<p>We don't want stuff like that forced onto us. </p>
<p>There has also been a massive redistribution of wealth to the wealthy, closure of small business, people becoming more dependent on the government. The world is heading in the wrong direction. We should be lifting people up but we are pushing more and more people down. This isn't sustainable.</p>

        <p>That's pretty broad, but in simple, somewhat objective terms: leadership is employing a myopic focus on complete disease eradication by vaccine while considering no other factors. When other ideas come up on how to treat COVID, they are immediately dismissed. government missteps have resulted in destruction of small business, harm to the economy, and the scapegoating of "the anti-vaxxers," who are actually not one group but several with distinct reasons. Some of these are religion, a focus on natural health, past harms by health care or government, and yes, some uneducated crazies. They are all treated like uneducated crazies. The government, instead of trying to find other workable solutions that consider people's long, solemnly held beliefs and values , is mandating a vaccine whose effectiveness is questionable for a virus whose effects don't quite line up with the data. Those who don't get it risk losing their job, not getting an in-person education, and being barred from indoor establishments. What's more is their family and friends are being turned against them by media articles stating that it is the fault of the unvaccinated that COVID is still here. Everyone hates each other. We probably need some social workers, psychologists, and anthropologists included on the COVID leadership team to consider the greater impact on our people. </p>
<p>There are likely other factors behind the scenes but it's hard to say which ones are true.</p>

        <p>We just question the common narrative, so it is easier to silence us then it is to answer the questions. Things such as: Why would a restaurant in Chicago require vax id for patrons when the person that caught covid which forced closure a week prior had the vax? Or, is it fair for a person sentenced to parole be forced to vaccinate as part of his sentencing? Why are the Pfizer contracts immune to any legality issues and they are not required to disclose any adverse affects for over 10 years? We just ask questions of our government, media, fellow Americans, fellow Humans.</p>

        <p>Hi OP. I don’t know for sure of course, but it seems like the virus is being used as a way to covertly usher in an AI-mediated social credit score system. Such a system only benefits those who implement it and not those who live under it. It is a living nightmare for those who live under it. You can look into such a system in Uyghur concentration camps—everything those people do is tracked, recorded, and scored on a system. Government can cut anyone off at any time for any reason. Absolute control. </p>
<p>Have you noticed the crack down on privacy in the last year? New cameras popping up in your hometown? I have. Facial recognition cameras everywhere. If you use social media, Instagram and Facebook—who work with and for the government—have access to everything you do on your phone—pictures, messages, call logs. This is only two of many examples. If you are paying attention with an open mind you will notice this too, I’m sure of it. </p>
<p>As per CDC stats, this is a virus that is only a threat to very old and enfeebled people. Forcing this vaccine—with unknown long term effects—indiscriminately on everyone is not in humanity’s best interest. I advocate for it only if you are in a high risk group. </p>
<p>As for myself, I have cystic fibrosis, got COVID and recovered from it in 3 days with appropriate treatment. Doctors who are being censored say that T-cell immunity can last for years, if not decades. </p>
<p>A good video to watch is Michael Yeadon’s “Final Warning to Humanity,” which you can find on places like bitchute and odysee. 
The rabbit hole is deep and this 55 min video is a good starting place. </p>
<p>Sorry for the hate you’re getting here. Can you see now why censorship is a bad thing? It keeps reasonable people from having reasonable discussions and pushes people to be angry and extremists in thought and opinion. After this tragedy washes over us all, I hope humanity can come together and work toward a better future for everyone, not just those who sit at the top of corporate and government organizations. We as a species are in deeeeeep need of healing.</p>

        <p>I’m guessing the majority of people in this sub distrust the government / big pharma connection. The way scientists who disagree with the ‘settled’ science are viewed as heretics and deplatformed. The way social media, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn etc censor everyday people. The force with which the jab is being marketed to people around the world, including laws and threats from government officials. There are probably more reasons. </p>
<p>I don’t think many people know what’s actually going on right now (myself included of course). I don’t think it’s as clear cut as, ‘Here virus. Virus dangerous. Take preventive medicine.’ People are distrustful for one reason or another. What we do know though is money and power have been centralised since the start of the pandemic and it looks set to continue.</p>

        <p>Good point. A lot of doctors and scientists have shared contrary information and have been dismissed as spreading disinformation. The optimist in me refuses to believe so many scientists would just be out there telling lies or even spreading information they don't have significant evidence for.</p>

        <p>Mass hysteria over something that has, at worst, killed 0.2% of the population, the vast majority of which were over 65.  Imagine how afraid we should be of heart disease.</p>

        <p>My honest thoughts is that covid is a little pushed over the edge on the media but it is real. Like yeah I literally took trains the whole covid and never have I got it and my whole family has been covid free with all of us working regularly. That had me thinking that most of the deaths from it is honestly are not true.</p>

        <p>It's hard to say. I remember learning how to "lie with data" in school. The results don't support your points? Filter them till they do (eg 70% of people prefer Candidate A could become the more compelling 95% of women over 40 prefer Candidate A). I think to an extent they do that with the data. I also think the frequent tests make it look worse.</p>
<p>I also believe in COVID, but I also still believe what the CDC and other officials said at the very beginning: that for most people it will be very mild (might even still be on their website). Based on current health, lack of comorbidities, hygiene, exercise, number of people i come into contact with, my chances of getting COVID and passing it to someone are extremely low. Even lower is my chance of going to the hospital or dying. The pharmaceutical industry's history is full of examples where they said something is safe and effective and it was later found to be unsafe and ineffective. I don't take any drugs, not even Tylenol, and haven't had a vaccine since childhood. I just can't rationalize getting this shot to myself. Trust me, I've tried. It's very uncomfortable for those who have not taken it right now.</p>

        <p>I disagree with a lot of things here but I agree with some as well. This sub allows much more  dissenting opinions  than most I was banned from asking questions in good faith or disagreements in other subs and that lead me here.I’m sure this place will get silenced eventually then I’ll likely just uninstall Reddit</p>
