    <strong>Decided to open my mouth and Come out Against Vaccine Passports</strong>
    <p><p>I opened my mouth and posted against vaccine passports on FB and another personal website. I figure at this point if I lose friends over this what will it matter? [I put up the Guardian article, and Naomi Wolf warning on Twitter] BTW can someone give me the link to Zuby
s posts?</p>
<p>I am pissed because an elderly friend took one of the shots and ended up having to call 911. I think she is okay now but this tells me the bad side effects are far more rampant than known. Younger people are going to be pushed into having these shots and losing years of life and future health IMO.</p>
<p>I am not discussing whether I got vaccine or not, they can guess, don't care. I figure if they do pass this garbage, that all our freedom is lost anyway and it occurred to me, they probably are entering names in a database, so faking with a fake card if someone decides to do that isn't going to cut it.</p>
<p>I hope some states refuse, glad Florida has. I have the feeling my state will oust our Dem governor on the next election. I am a progressive so have complex feelings about this, but leftists can bring totalitarianism too.  The Covid crap is getting out of control. Well now I am noticing they are saying it is spreading still and I don't even know anyone who has it.</p>
<p>Update: I get the feeling the posts are going to be ignored. One independent thinker friend who lives in another country did respond. Crickets otherwise, guess no one is telling me off. I did see acouple more "I'm getting the vaccine!" posts.</p></p>

        <p>It is nice to read a post from a person who identifies as progressive recognizing that our political system is two sides of the same coin. Freedom is at risk regardless of which party is in power. I wish you all the best, and hope you stay strong.</p>

        <p>thanks, I voted for Biden and regret it. I was a Bernie supporter. Because of this vaccine passport BS, I am done with the DNC for good. Some people told me reform of the DNC was possible but I think with Bernie ousted, never going to happen. The corporations own the parties and own this place and they got the propaganda and demographics perfected for each group. The extreme manipulation sucks.</p>

        <p>Yeah we regret it. I even wrote on my blog [under a different name] telling people to vote for Biden because Trump was so awful.</p>
<p>One irony of that is I wrote I thought tyranny could come from the right but said it was possible from the left too. LOL</p>
<p>We got played. I wrote all the stuff I hated about Biden too, and even wrote, I am voting for Biden to "buy time" and I wanted Biden to deal with Covid [in a real way not line up to be shot through with poison way]</p>
<p>Yeah we got played. I think the system is so corrupt it's beyond the pale.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I feel like a sucker that I thought Trump WAS the problem when all he was, was the Hegelian Dialectic reality actor meant to corral the lefties into the "obey the government and science" corral. I knew I should have left the country but with this one the elite have grabbed control of the whole world and I don't have the health to go to the third world. Yeah none of them are taking it serious.</p>

        <p>Because you believed the propaganda of the corporate media. Trump was not a dictator, facist, or a modern version of hitler. The fact you lived in "terror" for 4 years goes to show how misguided your worldview is.</p>

        <p>You are the REAL woke if you're recognizing that the democrats/"liberals" can bring authoritarianism too.</p>
<p>The tough part is not rubberbanding it and being taken in by the "other" authoritarian side.</p>
<p>Very honorable for you to speak up on sites with your name attached and everyone you know on there. It's true though, it will come out into the open soon enough with anyone you're close with anyway.</p>
<p>This fall: want to out to a restaurant or to the grocery store or into the corner shop while with a friend or loved one? They'll find out right then and there that you don't have your covid pass.</p>

        <p>Thanks. Yes they can, the cancel culture, the ignoring of class issues, the advancement of war, and THIS, totalitarianism via medical fiat, they are going full bore authoritarian. You are right one has to avoid rubber banding it. I believe TPTB use both sides against the middle. We are literally being crushed in between them. I even question the insurrection, I don't support it of course, but I wonder how that has been used to help advance "obedience" to authority.  Yeah it's probably going to come out in the open. I believe the virus is real, [I know some disagree with me here, that's okay, I do think the PCRs have been manipulated of course--and still wear a mask--so will I feel free like all the vaccinated who have thrown their masks in the trash and who are openly socializing? Remember this decision is based on my high risk, I understand healthier people who make other decisions.</p>
<p>Some have warned of the viruses the vaccinated may even be developing [the ADE] So that alone will "mark me". At the rate things are going, I may have to come out of the unvaccinated closet to stay alive, anyhow, court case etc, like if someone tries to cancel social security on me because I didn't line up obediently for a vacc that has much more risk to me then normal people.  Yeah not allowed in restaurants, or concerts or art classes. One liberal group could banish me too. I know that could be happening the "shunnings" I mention.</p>

        <p>Yes, all of this can definitely happen. I lost 3 jobs last year for not being covidbedient. Concerts haven't happened and even STILL a lot of restaurants have been closed for dine in (despite there having been no government order for quite some time), so those are already not an option anyway. Lots of shunning going on too, from strangers in the grocery store to my family.</p>

        <p>I know I am going to be shunned With one group it is going to be painful. I am on the spectrum and lost the family, had to walk because they were abusive years ago. I was dependent on outside clubs and groups to have any social interactions. Others will be facing lost jobs, now for refusing the vaccine. I know one guy who got the vaccine because his boss told him and because he works with health care recipients, he was told he "had to do it". I think he should have quit his job or refused, but most are giving in. My husband is in gig employment but I am noticing noose tightening being attempted even with that kind of work. Yeah say goodbye to concerts. Even though the shitty gene therapy doesn't prevent transmission, they want to ban people who haven't gotten it basically from society.  Yeah it's horrible you are being shunned too.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I hope your sister refuses. Health is worth all the money in the world. Tell her once that is gone there will be no career. I was disabled in my 20s and have spent my adulthood in lower income. The bank won't care if her body is overtaken with severe autoimmune disorders.</p>

        <p>I have a condition related to EDS in that many with it have EDS too so I am very familiar with it. I don't think she would do well with it, not at all. Some sane countries [not this one] have warned people with allergy histories and autoimmune disorders to stay away. She may be able to get a legal exemption. I wonder if any are stepping up in the disability community or if they are all blinded by DNC rhetoric. Oh have her read FDA pfizer papers, it lists autoimmune stuff.</p>

        <p>I have been on it with her, and thankfully our mom is with me. My mom's oncologist as well as her primary care doctor have both recommended she neither wear a mask nor get the vaccine. Good lord the arguments I've heard her have to go through when she tells them that multiple doctors have told her not to mask up.......... people just legitimately can't understand how bodies are unique and come with unique medical histories and needs??</p>
<p>Side note: my mom, on top of EDS, has gone through surgery for cancer (second occurrence of breast cancer, first was about 15 years ago) as well as being diagnosed with emphysema within the last year, while also dealing with having an ileostomy put in last year as well, does not wear a mask, has not changed her social life, and has not gotten sick in the last year. And she's in her 60's. By all "statistical" accounts, she should be dead-by-covid about 5 times over by now.</p>

        <p>Glad your mother has stayed healthy. I believe the virus is real but I think they've lied about a lot of it. Yeah she should have been dead by covid. I joked once, that the way they talk we should be seeing bodies strewn in every street. </p>
<p>I have COPD and the masks are a nightmare. I do get short of breathe A LOT in them. I think someone with advanced COPD or emphysema the masks do compromise us. I am disabled but if I had to wear one 8 hours a day it would never happen. I am glad your mother has doctor's with some sense. Mine told me he would understand whatever choice I take, but my trust of him went down when he told me he got it. I am sure he was under job pressure etc, but it bothers me. :(</p>

        <p>Definitely, she is an odd case!! I have been saying for a while now that she is either the luckiest or unluckiest person in medical history - probably literally speaking - based on what she has had to go through, and yet survived. In the 80's she contracted an incredibly rare mycobacterium while stationed in Okinawa. It took doctors all over the world literally 9 years to figure out what it was before the CDC themselves cultured it out. There had been 5 other documented cases in medical history, all of whom died... so her leg is still in a pickling jar somewhere at the CDC for them to do their "studies" on. That alone "should" have killed her.</p>
<p>Then there's the autoimmune conditions, cancer (twice), etc etc..... not to make light of the situation, but she even tried to commit suicide a little over a decade ago, and even a purposeful overdose couldn't kill her. She has some kind of "protection" going on for some reason 😅</p>

        <p>Wow she's made it through a lot. Yeah don't have her go get a vaccine that will make her system busy with spike proteins and messing up her immune system. She is definitely immunocompromised if she lost her lag to a rare mycobacterium. Hope she listens to your warnings.</p>

        <p>She is doing her own warning to others 😊 thankfully her relevant doctors are also not nutcases. It's nice to have her as the one close family member who isn't brainwashed by all this propaganda. She's quite a lady.</p>

        <p>Well, that's my mother I was talking about here... my sister is a slightly more concerning matter. She says she will not take the jab, but she has a pretty hefty income from working for a huge bank to lose/be threatened with. I hate to say it, but I really don't think she'll make the right decision when it comes to taking the jab or losing her job. I'd LIKE to say I think she'll still know better, but I don't know...</p>
<p>My mom and I have been talking with her about all the covid propaganda and lies all year long. Sister is VERY nonconfrontational middle-of-the-fence. She recognizes that this is a very propagandized event, but doesn't think much past that. She also recognizes that masks don't do anything, scientifically speaking, but wears one wherever they "ask" that you do. Basically, she has taken the path of least resistance so far, so I imagine she'll do the same when it comes down to vaccine passports etc.</p>

        <p>Glad your mother questions it all. Yeah your sister may give in, prepare yourself. You can't tell people what to do. A close friend of mine even went to go take the vaccine. Lined right up. And it was over a job. I think those of us who refuse "The narrative" are going to be in the minority.</p>
