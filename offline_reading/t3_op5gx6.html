    <strong>The reasons why East Asia is still on the COVID bandwagon (Hong Kong)</strong>
    <p><p><strong>In this post, I briefly explain the cultural factors and give possible explainations of why COVID hype is still high(ish) in Asia.</strong></p>
<p>Masks, social distancing, temperature checkers, alcohol rubbers. These are the signs you would always see everywhere in Asia since COVID era.</p>
<p>Topics regarding Asia, especially East Asia, is not something you see everyday on the subreddit or discussions regarding Corona, yet, the situation here in the ground (Hong Kong) is just as bad if not among the worst in the world.</p>
<h1>The truth is, East Asia is the perfect 'testing ground' for strict restrictions, because of the unqiue cultural aspects that allows it to be easily subdued.</h1>
<p>In East Asia, you are taught to be conform, obey, don't cause trouble. I would label the societies of East Asia as <strong>Conformist.</strong> Contray to Westerners saying that Asian societies are collective, they are not. They are hyper-indivdiualist, hypercompetitive; The collectivistic aspect of the culture are mostly apperciated by older people; They help each other in their communities. I haven't seen that spirit in the Youth. East Asians don't really work for greater good of their community more than other people, that's why Karoshi (work to death) is a thing.</p>
<p>In addition, the East Asian culture is introverted. The Youth are playing video games all the times at home, they don't really mind the online classes, says it's great for them because they don't have to go outside and face other people.</p>
<p>Lots of East Asians living in the cities, also have low self-esteem, hence they like the masks because they think they 'look better' with it which is complete bullshit and an avoidance of facing the reality.</p>
<h1>Why people still fear COVID?</h1>
<p>I can tie the fear of COVID to some main reasons, in additional to the above ones.</p>
<p>1.Not COVID-skepiticism enough material in local languages</p>
<p>2.Strict laws, being caught without masks can mean you're fined 1/3 of your salary (HK is among the most expensive places in the world)</p>
<p>3.COVID is still mysterious in East Asia, as there's never been any outbreaks</p>
<p>4.Mass-masking fuels anxiety</p>
<p>5.Sheep-ish mentality of the locals (Amazing the same protesters from 2019 would 100% get on the bandwagon that is COVID restrictions meant to take away their freedom)</p>
<h1>Good news</h1>
<p>Not all of us are sheeps. In Japan, there is a facebook group with 3500 something people called Corona Lie Eradication Corps (コロナ嘘撲滅隊) that posts localized material. In Hong Kong (and some Taiwanese members), there's a anti-pandemic group called Say Fuck to the "Pandemic" (企硬！向奕晴說FUCK). This group posts both English material and localized material. I personally translate material in my spare time from English to Chinese and share it with the locals.</p>
<p>COVID skeptisim is growing among the youth, many of us actually see that the masks are to last forever.  </p>
<p>People who were doomers to begin with, don't go outside much anyway so online forums shouldn't really be a measurement.</p>
<p>The Older generation, who's actually seen harder times, don't care. Many of them don't wear the masks. It's the youth who like the masks so much.</p></p>

<p>Damn, that's disappointing to hear, especially from HK.  What's the fucking point of risking your life against CCP tyranny in 2019, only to just bend over and grab your ankles for those same tyrants the very next year just because there's a nasty flu going around? And a nasty flu they created themselves!</p>

        <p>Most people are trend followers, just like everywhere else. A lot of Hong Kong protesters don't know what they are fighting for, only came because their friends and it's 'cool' to do so. Oh and, its' funner than playing LoL at home.  </p>
<p>by the way, Taiwan is even worse, at least in Hong Kong lots of people are aware that something's up with the 'pandemic' but in Taiwan it's extremely bad. People in Taiwan literally support police <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4250059">fining a couple for drinking water INSIDE their car</a> and smart <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIF8vrz_3S0">cameras that can detect maskers and non-maskers</a>.</p>
