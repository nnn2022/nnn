        <p>I had a friend die from pneumonia after a bad flu a few years ago. </p>
<p>He was out of shape, smoked like a chimney, ate like shit. They hooked him up to a ventilator and he died. Sound familiar? </p>
<p>34 years old. </p>
<p>The only difference between what happened to him and today is, today he wouldn't have had his wife by his side. That's it. </p>
<p>Covid is a repackaged flu. TV is the virus.</p>

        <p>TV <em>is</em> the Virus. </p>
<p>&rt;There's the television. It's all right there - all right there. Look, listen, kneel, pray. Commercials! We're not productive anymore. We don't make things anymore. It's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Yeah. Okay, okay. Buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, if you don't, what are you then, I ask you? What? Mentally ill. Fact, Jim, fact - if you don't buy things: toilet paper, new cars, computerized yo-yos, electrically-operated sexual devices, stereo systems with brain-implanted headphones, screwdrivers with miniature built-in radar devices, voice-activated computers...</p>

        <p>2018 IIRC a family member of mine lost 3-4 friends in a single year from flu related complications... No one cared because no one is afraid of the flu that's actually pretty freaking rough in ALL demographics and do asymptomatic cases even exist ? (Genuine question as I have never heard of it because no one cares about flu).</p>

        <p>I had 2 grandfathers die a few years ago. How did they die, you ask? </p>
<p>They both were in their 80s, caught a cold, and developed pneumonia. They died of a common respiratory infection.</p>
<p>No one cared. No one wore masks. No one cancelled Thanksgiving or Christmas.</p>
<p>Just imagine trying to explain to someone 10 years ago what we are doing right now. They would think it's some B movie on the Sci-Fi channel.</p>

        <p>10 years ago not every loser had a cell phone with internet access. They tried to pull the same shit off many times in the past. Swine flu? Bird flu?</p>
<p>This time they were so successful because of the fact that every sheep had a phone with internet and sheeple made the media's job so easy. Sheeple spread the rumors and panic so effectively that everybody was bombarded with this garbage heavily 24/7. </p>
<p>Also the name COVID or Coronavirus is more scary than bird flu or swine flu. It's just a flu after all.</p>

        <p>Just explained this, lol, but I'll copy+paste it here as well.</p>
<p>Oh my god.</p>
<p>Influenza has been around for a REALLY long time! We have developed vaccines for it. It used to be really deadly, but now we have a vaccine. Vaccines put little things that kind of act like wanted posters into your body. They don't harm you or give you autism or cancer. These wanted posters show our immune system what the flu looks like, that it's bad for us, and how to kill it. Then, when our immune system finds the flu in our body, it instantly knows that it has to kill it, and how to do this.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be insulting your intelligence with this, because I'm sure you already knew that, just clarifying how they work for other people who might be reading.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-19 on the other hand, doesn't have a vaccine YET. Top scientists are working on making one.</p>
<p>So yes, the flu is spread, (actually a lot,) but it's usually killed before it can do any damage in the body. If you've gotten your flu vaccine, and you hear that it's not for you but for other people, that's because it can transfer to other people before your immune system even finds it. So if you get your vaccine, and the influenza is killed quickly, it can't transfer to anyone.</p>
<p>Basic logic, right?</p>
<p>Now, with the combination of masks AND the vaccine, the flu is going down exponentially better than it would've with only the vaccine. Since we weren't wearing masks in the past years, obviously some people who don't have their flu shot are going to get it and transfer it to others who don't have the vaccine, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Again, basic logic?</p>
<p>Since Covid doesn't have a vaccine, we have to wear masks! In my opinion, we shouldn't let people out if they can't wear masks. I wish masks only protected the wearer, but it's almost not for them at all. It's common decency to do anything within reason to save a stranger's life, (right...?) and wearing a mask can help someone who is asymptomatic (in that weird period where you have the virus, but don't have the disease yet) not spread the virus to anyone they even remotely come into contact with. Even if you're not sick, that's why people should still wear masks. It's to protect anyone else around them, at almost no cost to the wearer. When we get the vaccine, there probably will still be some Covid cases! Just like the flu. What the top minds of the world are trying to do (for ungrateful people who think they know more, might I add) is learn more about Covid/the corona virus so that we can get a vaccine and push the numbers of infections down to somewhere around the flu's, and make it less dangerous, so people who have to work around someone who's infected don't go into ARDS and die in a hospital. :)</p>
<p>For your statement that the flu is the corona virus... I'm not sure how to respond to that, because I'm not sure what you mean.
Do you mean that they're the same virus? (Obviously false)
Do you mean that they're the same diseases? (Again, obviously false.)
Or do you mean that they share a couple traits, like being illnesses for the human body? (Because both are illnesses, I'll give you that.)</p>
<p>So yes, wear your mask. Don't go outside unless you want to possible expose this LIFE-THREATENING virus to a stranger. You don't even have to be nice! Just be decent.</p>

        <p>Ok, I know they are different viruses, just to clarify. But you did copy paste so I get it.</p>
<p>We have been developing flu vaccines for years and sure they help. But, they've never brought down flu by as much as this. You can't tell me that masks did that, because it simply isn't true. There have been many studies conducted on masks in the transmission of influenza and similar viruses pre 2020, and they all concluded that there was little effect.</p>
<p>Last thing, covid isn't a life threatening disease, really. For some, yes, but to this group of the population many diseases which are mild for most of the population could be life threatening for them. Still, despite this, the average survival rate for 70+ is still 94.6%. So it isn't a death sentence. People need the choice to make decisions and risk assessments dependent on their individual situation. It is wrong to lock people up for not covering their faces when it has such little effect. And to close, unintentionally paasing a disease onto someone and they die from that is not equivalent to killing someone. It never ever will be.</p>

        <p>I never said that giving someone covid is the same as personally killing them, but it does endanger their life.</p>
<p>Just because I don't like car crashes doesn't mean I don't like cars, and I'm not saying you shouldn't drive them.</p>
<p>I like freedom, obviously, I just think that putting on a mask (even if it barely helps) is something that people should do.</p>
<p>Masks have stopped the flu. Why else would the flu be so low this year? Because we're socially distancing? That helps too, along with masks.</p>
<p>And for your comment about 94.6%, that is true.</p>
<p>I'm just saying that those 5.4% of people shouldn't have had to die because someone didn't have their mask on, and we could lower that number by wearing more masks.</p>
<p>India has a 1.5% mortality rate opposed to the USA's 2%, and masks are mandatory in India.</p>
