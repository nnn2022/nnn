    <strong>What is there not to believe about the virus?</strong>
    <p><p>Alright, so just to start off, I'm new to this subreddit, so sorry if the title or flair doesn't follow a rule, but I'm genuinely curious.</p>
<p>Are people here against the virus itself or people who are taking it out of hand?</p>
<p>The virus sucks ass, yeah. And it's been around for over a year now, and while activities where people are distancing from each other and such is fine, impatience isn't an excuse to try to go back to normal. The virus isn't a political opinion, and as a person with immuno-compromised family members, I hate people who aren't taking this pandemic seriously. You guys are the ones complaining that it's taking too long, but you're also the ones making this issue worse by not taking it seriously. If everyone just followed the guidelines for a few damn weeks, we would be back to normal already. There's no one to blame except for the people who aren't taking it seriously, and while the government is ridiculous in some aspects, it's not their fault; it's other people that are skeptic about a pandemic that affected the world, not just the US or wherever you are.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure where you live but most everyone followed the rules where I live. If an intervention is going to work, even partial adherence should show some positive results. Any intervention that required 100% compliance is a bad idea and destined to fail. Thinking the lockdown measures “worked” is entertaining. What does work mean exactly? Does that mean reduce transmission? Flatten the curve? Covid zero? Flatten the curve was never intended to “beat” covid, and at the start they expressly told us that it would just reduce the peak, but lengthens the time that it takes to get to herd immunity. It seems to be by the definition of working “flatten the curve” worked. Flatten the curve goes against against all traditions of epidemic that prioritized society functioning to prevent societal collapse. Lockdown “science” was developed by a teenage girl for a sconce project! That fact you’ve bought it hook line and sinker is hilarious.</p>

        <p>The media and governments keep operating on the basis that this is a magical alien supervirus that has it's own rules and no one knows anything about (even after over a year). As if it wasn't a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus...hardly anything enigmatic.</p>
<p>Do you actually believe that this is a totally sane, normal, scientific response to a respiratory virus?</p>
<p>Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this one before? Why do you think that back at beginning of the 2020 they weren't going insane? Why do you think they act like numerous studies (like the ones on masks, for example) published prior to 2020, don't exist anymore? Why do you think they act like they don't know the difference between CFR and IFR, and other obvious things about virology and epidemiology? Why do you think decades of established science, logic, reason, science, and common sense was flushed down the toilet a little more than a year ago? Why do you think the WHO changed the definition of herd immunity (and then changed it back after they were called out on it)? Why do you think there's been 24/7 blaring fearmongering for the past 12 months? Why do you think "experts" completely ignore the massive damage lockdowns  have caused to every facet of society? Why do you think the worse possible modeled scenarios are being used to drive public policy? Why do you think the science community is ignoring all the observational data from around the world that shows that most of the prescribed safety measures aren't effective (masks, lockdowns)? Why do you think they're censoring &amp; silencing doctors who advocate for cheap already existing medicine like Ivermectin that had shown extreme effectiveness in lesssning symptoms and saving lives? Why do you think schools were shut down (even though children are literally 5 times more likely to die from the flu and this information has been avaliable since February of 2020)? And last but not least...why do you think there's worldwide rallies for freedom all over the world? I'm not aware of any other pandemic that had rallies for freedom globally...</p>
<p>I think the fact that people are marching for freedom all over the world during a "deadly global pandemic" that "demands" a myriad of draconian restrictions and rules, should be glaring proof enough that the covid response is truly a massive psycho break from decades of established science, logic &amp; common sense and that something very nefarious is going on.</p>
<p>What has happened after March 2020 has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Everything concerning this virus is a massive break from all protocol and sanity.</p>
<p>The point is that this a 0.2% IFR common respiratory virus which has an average mortality age over 80...and this is how every common cold virus originated. A virus like this doesn't warrant ANY draconian measures. Never forget <em>that</em> is the prime fact, and they are always trying to obscure it. This whole thing is a dystopian false narrative that has made the populace believe a mild respiratory virus is a plague. That is the main talking point here. You know the truth about this virus, then the entire narrative comes crashing down.</p>

        <p>Herd immunity does exist, but it takes time for that to happen, and while the large majority will survive, there's still that small percentage of people who will die, and we need to take this into consideration. Going outside and wearing a mask + social distancing isn't a dystopia, it's just staying safe before enough vaccines are made...</p>

        <p>Shutting down schools over a low IFR virus that doesn't even effect children in any significant way is a dystopia. Enforcing lockdowns that cause destruction to every facet of society (and consequently more death because of economies crashing) is a dystopia.

<p>Why do you keep ignoring the fact that is a low IFR virus that didn't warrant any of this insanity? Acording to your logic, wr might as well shut down schools forever so no kid ever unknowingly gives their grandparents influenza which might kill them...don't you see how ridicilous you sound?</p>

        <p>... you realize that showing no symptoms doesn't mean that you DON'T have the virus, correct? As you've said, which is also a proven claim, "most children aren't affected by the virus", they don't have to worry about it, and even though they might not experience symptoms, they can be carriers of the virus.</p>

        <p>If you don’t want to get sick stay home. I shouldn’t have to be forced to quarantine or lose my job/business if I don’t want to quarantine. Wether the virus has a survival rate of 99% (which it does) or 5% it is still my choice wether or not I go out in public, because if the safe thing to do is stay home, my going out won’t impact your staying home. What I do, will not affect what you do unless the people who control is under threat of violence get involved. So don’t blame us just like I (and hopefully most on this sub) don’t blame you.</p>

        <p>Yeah, of course. Taking off your mask in the open if no one, or barely anyone is nearby, is fine, but if you're in a public area with a bunch of people, then wear a mask so that you don't put them in potential danger.

        <p>Smokers/vapers: wear a mask and exhale the smoke or vapor near a mirror. Everybody else: wear a mask and go somewhere cold enough to see water droplets in your breath when you exhale, like a walk-in cooler, and watch as well as you can. See where it goes.</p>
<p>If you want droplets kept out when you inhale, wear an n95, fitted correctly, with a shaved face. If you want to keep them in when you exhale... too bad, you can't. A wide, long shield with a snug headband will direct droplets downward and <em>maybe</em> help a little (try that experiment too). Masks do nothing for the kind of droplets you make when breathing and talking, and if you're coughing forcefully you should stay home anyway.</p>

        <p>How come other countries did it then, and they either have much less cases or it's almost completely wiped out? It's not a "government" thing, it's a "listen to the fucking healthcare officials because they know what they're talking about" thing.

<p>You mean some island nations (that still regularly lockdown over a single case) and a few totalitarian countries that bullshit their numbers? Yeah, no.</p>
<p>If lockdowns were truly a viable solution you would be able to name 5 land countries that eliminated covid, right? Go on, name at least 5. I'll wait.</p>

        <p>Would you not prefer a lockdown every once in a while instead of being stuck with businesses closing, mask wearing, limited access, and so forth? Other than the lockdown to prevent cases from popping up, New Zealand among a select few of other countries are back to normal.</p>

        <p>I don't prefer any of the bs, because this is missing the point entirely...the point that this is a 0.2% IFR virus that doesn't warrant any of this insanity. </p>
<p>New Zealand is a tiny island with a miniscule population that can easily close its borders and yet still is regularly locking down entire cities and abusing its citizens over a single case. The NZ "success story" is also pushed tens of thousands of children into extreme poverty.</p>
<p>And if you haven't notixed, you couldn't name at least 5 countries. Because the facts are on my side. Literally nothing you believe about the response to this virus reflects reality.</p>

        <p>Not wearing a mask in public areas and such isn't saving lives either; it can do quite the opposite. While it's not common, the fact that the possibility does exist is something that needs to be taken into consideration.</p>

        <p>It is really simple, there is the neutral state, you live your life, I live mine and we stay out of each other's business unless we both want to interact. Now you come in and start pushing things on me based on some potentiality. It's not "just a cloth", I've already lost my job and not just that, the whole place I worked at is pretty much gone. We had some cool "research" going on but not anymore because it was not essential. Calling it bullshit is simply pushing back because you won't let up pushing.</p>
<p>And also tunnel vision. Just take a step back around and think. I'm pretty sure the vaccine people want to vaccinate you and keep vaccinating you even if there is no virus, because it brings them money. And the rich man wants to take your money and bring you down. Etc. Everything all around is fucked, and the only counter-argument you can give is "it would have been much worse if there were no measures" even though no one can judge what would have been. </p>
