    <strong>Ugh, These People</strong>
    <p><p>I really don't understand how you could be so antifreedom, even for yourself. I fight against this, not just for my own freedom and the freedom of my loved ones, but for everyone's freedom, because everyone deserves freedom. They have the freedom to be a paranoid wuss and wear a face diaper and  be prisoners of their own homes, but we should have the freedom to not do those things. Nothing is ever good enough for them. On NoNoNewNormal, I saw someone write this:</p>
<p>"I just don't get the whole "freedom" angle. Freedom to...not have a face covering?"</p>
<p>.....Yes, you idiot! We have the freedom to wear whatever the hell we want, that's not something you have a say over. You do NOT get to tell us that we have no choice what we do with our own goddamn faces. Our faces belong to us, not you, not your fear, not the government, not society, not a grocery store. You do NOT get to tell us that if we want to participate in society, that we don't have a choice. They're like, yeah, because of our fear, you don't get to choose. We get to choose for you and you don't get a say since we know everything. </p>
<p>It makes me sick. But, I don't know what I was expecting from someone called "buttsareneat."</p>
<p>These people seriously think they're the sane ones. You know who else hated freedom? Nazis!</p></p>

<p>They can grocery delivery, amazon prime, and every other tool at their hands to accommodate their fear of this terrible virus. But it's not good enough for them, they have to impose their paranoia on everyone.</p>

        <p>I really hate that after a year if you want to breathe and live life everything has to be virtual or curbside to accommodate the doomers. At this point the zoom option should be for those who need or want to abstain from life for whatever reason. But no, that wouldn’t cause enough suffering and doesn’t get authoritarians dicks hard so we don’t do it.</p>

        <p>They've been frightened by propaganda and heavily influenced by the hundreds of expert psychologists the government employees to manipulate the population into compliance. It's constant and almost all encompassing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately when people are manipulated this way, frightened and sent into a moral panic, they're very susceptible to authoritarian/totalitarian ideas and can ultimately be pushed into committing outrageous atrocities.</p>

        <p>To breathe fresh air! To not breath in carbon dioxide. To not deoxygenate our own blood! It’s called natural law and it is sovereign! Above that of any other laws! It’s called natural law and inherent rights as human beings. This law is sovereign.it is the very basis of justice and freedom from tyranny.</p>
<p>Peace can only happen when we have sovereignty over our lives, our bodies and our consciousness. Sovereignty also requires responsibility. It means that we must cultivate the necessary faculties and skills to be able to discern right from wrong and truth from lie. These people who are brainwashed by a man on TV think it’s their right to tell you you have to do something to your body foe their wellbeing do not understand bodily sovereignty.</p>

        <p>This! My parents are very covid safe but they do so while being very anti lockdowns and pro people freedoms. They literally shut themselves in their house, and yes I know it’s insane but at least they are not trying to change other people. I’m 17 but don’t live at home and go out all the time, and I tell them, my parents are proud that I’m living the life I want to. Their logic is simple, they don’t need to do anything. My father retired right before the pandemic and my parents have a beautiful house in nature and enjoy each other’s company. My father is so mad about lockdowns though. “How do these democrats expect anyone to make money”. While I disagree with my dad about the virus my dad just says, there are valid points on both sides and I just don’t know and don’t want to take a chance that will be bad long term. His point is when your 17 a couple months does make a big difference but big picture for him at his age it doesn’t make a difference. At some point he will realize nothing we do will satisfy these crazy people and they don’t want the real normal they want the NEW NORMAL. Wish they wouldn’t be afraid of the virus but I still respect that they don’t feel their opinions have the right to infringe on anyone else’s right to live their life.</p>

        <p>So should a operating surgeon have the freedom to not wear a mask because he wants his freedom? It would be against freedom if he couldn't be a surgeon and wear no mask at the same time. Or a Kindergarden teacher wearing very revealing clothes, you would cut down their freedom to protect your children. Freedom isn't automatically taken away just because there are minor restrictions of it.</p>

        <p>This is not a minor restriction. These are highly unnecessary and idiotic things to do. It changes the entire way we live our lives, and we never consented to it. This is different from just being a doctor, they signed up for that. We didn't. All we want is to live in society like normal people without your paranoia being shoved down our throats "for the greater good." If you can't see how this is at all different and your "comparison" is not a comparison at all, I don't know what to tell you.</p>
