        <p>I really needed to read this. I'm talking to a friend whose 23 year old healthy wife won't let him do welding school because she, herself, is "high risk".... What the actual fuck... I'm losing my sanity trying to explain this to people but we're in two different realities and idk what to do about it.</p>

        <p>I’ve just come to the point that there really isn’t any way of changing their minds and  having an open discussion with them. With their stubborn minds, they are the only smart, right ones. No other opinion/fact matters. </p>
<p>I have coworkers who are honestly afraid they will catch COVID and die. They’re all young, healthy individuals. The fear that media has instilled in these people is unethical, but at the same time I don’t really feel sorry for them. They refuse to open their eyes and question everything that’s going on.</p>
