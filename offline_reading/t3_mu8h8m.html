        <p>He's not a bad cop. It's an approved police 'hold' that was used 247 times in 2019 with not a single person dead. George Floyd had a .13 fentanyl level when people die at .03 (aka over 4x the amount when the average person overdoses.)</p>

        <p>Correct. But they’re also supposed to be moved into a recovery position after a certain amount of time. Chauvin never did that.</p>

        <p>There's no guideline on 'how long before moving into a recovery position'. Also, you can see he was on his back not his neck in several of the video clips, so the 9 minutes and whatever seconds is a bullshit narrative, esp when Floyd was asked clearly "Are you on anything ? Did you swallow anything ?" and then lied about not having swallowed 4x the lethal dose of fentanyl. Again, THIS HOLD WAS USED 247 TIMES IN 2019 and NONE OF THEM DIED.</p>

        <p>There is an exact guideline for when they are supposed to be moved into recovery position. According the Minneapolis Police Training, its  after they are restrained with handcuffs. He already had handcuffs on so forcing him into that prone position was excessive. He was also clearly on drugs which makes it more neglectful on the officers part. Yes they asked him if he was on drugs but of course a lot of people are going to lie in that situation. One of the officers even says “this is why you don’t do drugs kids”</p>

        <p>"  He already had handcuffs on so forcing him into that prone position was excessive. " He requested to be put on the ground and then he was struggling once he was on the ground. Instruction is to subdue the perp until they stop resisting, which George Floyd did not ever settle down. He was not 'clearly' on drugs, he was asked and he could speak, thus he did not seem like he was incapable of speech or overdosing. He LIED about swallowing the drugs when asked. And yes, the officer said that because he was acting like the crackhead he was. You DO know crackheads act like crackheads even when crack is NOT in their system,right?</p>

Five reasons not to trust George Floyd, including this 2019 arrest video where he's pulling the same crying, pleading whining bullshit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7reJpf-23o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7reJpf-23o</a> It also proves the prosecutor doctored the footage and lied in the court case's final arguments (the prosecutor played a clip pretending the cop walked up with guns drawn, when the REAL video shows a flashlight tapping on the window)</p>

        <p>Lies. He said 'I can't breath' like 30 seconds into the attempted arrest, like 10-12 minutes before he was on the ground. He also faked that shit in the past : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7reJpf-23o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7reJpf-23o</a></p>

        <p>So because he said he couldn’t breathe before that means when he was in a position where a normal person couldn’t breathe and he said he couldn’t breathe he was lying? If you say you can’t breathe and then I choke you and you can’t breathe why should I believe you saying you can’t breathe? Do you see how that argument doesn’t make sense? Just cause he started panicking saying he couldn’t breathe when a normal person probably could, doesn’t mean you just get to do whatever to him and claim “how would I know he couldn’t breathe?”</p>

<p>He wasn't. Again, the hold has been used 247 times in 2019 and no one died [and half the time, it was used by black cops!]. Again, he was saying 'I can't breath' TEN MINUES BEFORE BEING ON THE GROUND. So yes, he was lying, stupid.(Proven even mroe in the 2019 footage where he pulled the same bullshit.)</p>

        <p>Are you for real? Do you honestly believe that if you were having a panic attack, like he appeared to be having, that you would be able to breathe with an officer pinning you down like that? We’ve established that hold has been used but that’s irrelevant because according to MPD training, it is for getting a suspect who is resisting into handcuffs. After they are in handcuffs they are supposed to be moved to their side or sat up. Seriously dude quit bootlicking and go watch the trial. You might learn a thing or two</p>

        <p>He was not having a panic attack, he had meth and 4x the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system, stupid. He was ACTING LIKE A CRACKHEAD. I know, I've seen a thousand crackheads in my life, kiddo. They make that same fake ass screaming sound and make up a thousand excuses like we saw in the 2019 footage, STUPID.

        <p>No, you didn't. You're ignoring the clear cut facts he presented. A week of people crying about what they saw on the street from a bad angle means nothing. Clearly you haven't seen the 20 minute video where it shows over 10 minutes BEFORE he was on the ground lying to cops, won't get in the car, is faking being scared, swallows his drugs (we have the photo/video proving it plus the 4x lethal dose in his system ENOUGH TO KILL FOUR PEOPLE, KIDDO.)</p>

        <p>\&rt; lying to cops</p>
<p>Somone lying is not a reason to kill someone.</p>
<p>\&rt; won't get in the car</p>
<p>Not getting in a car is not a reason to kill someone.</p>
<p>\&rt; faking being scared</p>
<p>Firstly, pretending to be scared is not a reason to kill someone. Secondly, you have no proof that he was pretending, you are just saying that because of your arbitrary OPINION... court cases are driven by FACTS. Did you watch the court case? There was no evidence presented during the court case regarding that fact he was faking his feelings.</p>
<p>I have some evidence to suggest that he was scared though. Did you know that George Floyd has been shot by police before? He was. He has literally had a bullet fired into his body. Imagine the PTSD one could develop after literally being shot.</p>
<p>In this situation, the police officer who originally interacted with him, pulled out a GUN out on him for pretty much no reason. Wouldn't you be scared in that situation? Especially if you've been shot by police before? It's plausible to assume that they triggered a panic attack because of his past experience.</p>
<p>\&rt; swallow his drugs</p>
<p>Medically, the drugs didn't have much of an effect based on the numerous medical professionals that testified. Additionally, someone being a drug addict is not a good enough reason to kill someone.</p>

        <p>LOL, you clown. January 6th was peaceful. Cop died from natural causes. ANTIFA/BLM tried to infiltrate, got beat up and handed over to cops, and how many shots fired? Compare that to any ANTIFA / BLM riot in 2020 or 2021, you dishonest creep.</p>
