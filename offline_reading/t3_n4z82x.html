    <strong>i don't even know who i am anymore and this covid world is impossible to live in</strong>
    <p><p>i have been suffering with depression since i was about 9 years old. i am currently 20, finishing up my third year of university. i have had many dark periods in the past which i will not get into. after a certain amount of seeing how many things i was missing out on or ruining for myself due to me having a hard time managing my emotions. one thing that really helped me was beginning to take care of my body in terms of how i eat and exercise at around the age of 16. i began to eat better and to run despite me being so out of shape that my whole body hurt. after months of this, i began actually enjoying exercise and doing it more regularly. when i went to university, i really struggled socially. i am a quiet and awkward person and i wasn't really able to make friends. the only friends i really had freshman year were people who took advantage of my kindness, because i am someone who goes above and beyond for my friends, and unfortunately i didn't think i could do any better, so i stayed around people who made me feel lonely and used. in the middle of my first year of college was when i began isolating myself, and this was one of the darkest times i've ever experienced. not having family or any familiar people around to care for me or guide me led me to barely leaving my room for months on end.</p>
<p>the next schoolyear, although i went through a lot more difficult experiences, i began figuring out the things that made me feel better. i would go to either the gym or the indoor track at my school multiple times a week and it helped so much. i made myself busy and tried to branch out to meet new friends because i knew how much of a toll being alone took on me. i found a reason to get up and get dressed every day and took pride in my unique, kinda-cool kinda-weird style.</p>
<p>it is a year and a half after that. i have completely lost myself. i am back in my university's town renting an apartment but i stay in bed all day and stay fairly isolated except for seeing my boyfriend who i am very lucky to have. i haven't properly exercised in so long because i'm not about to go to a gym in a mask. i have always struggled with exercise induced shortness of breath and it is difficult enough for me without a mask. i am lucky to have spent the time away from school with my family who i love very much, although we are a bit dysfunctional and it can be difficult sometimes. i feel like i am disintegrating before my very eyes. i have ruined my posture and i feel like all of the hard work i have done on myself was temporary and that makes me so upset. i have panic attacks multiple times a week and i cry at least every few days.</p>
<p>places are open but there is nowhere i want to go. i don't go onto campus except for mandatory covid testing and my job. i am tired of being reminded of all of these regulations. i am tired of everything being about covid. i am tired of seeing little kids in masks. i miss seeing people smile, i miss going to parties even though they gave me anxiety, it was just something that felt like a different world and my peers and i are having every part of our college experience taken away. my sister is graduating high school and her mental health has also taken a sharp decline due to all the shit she has to endure because of the overreaction of this stupid virus. i am tired of being reminded everywhere and i am tired of the people who try to make all this shit trendy (like posting their vaccine cards or all of the stupid stickers on snapchat with all the covid slogans). i have become unwillingly addicted to my phone and computer.</p>
<p>i used to enjoy my classes, but these online classes are beyond terrible. they make me feel so depressed and my professors give us extra work because they can't interact with us and i can't do any of it anymore. we haven't even gotten a proper break because it's a risk apparently. i feel like i am slipping away from myself and giving up on life. i have lost all of my motivation, interests, ability to take care of myself. i feel constantly hopeless and tired. i feel like everything i have worked hard on has been destroyed because of this terrible response to this virus that is not nearly as much of a threat as they say it is. i am tired.</p></p>

        <p>Before commiserating with you on the virus, I want to stand by you and say: you are not alone. It breaks my heart to hear that you are going through all this. I used to suffer from depression and I know the severity of the word “tired”. Please please know that what little I can do (reaching out to you, praying, offering to message you) I do to show that there are those out there who care. </p>
<p>If anything, just know I care. </p>
<p>On the virus, this is near how they want people to feel. Preying on our exhaustion till we submit. The sad part is sometimes people will be pushed too hard to submit till they break. It’s disgusting. </p>
<p>Finding passion, maybe we could talk one on one so I could understand your position more and offer a person to toss ideas and feelings off of. Just an offer.</p>

        <p>I second what the other kind commenter said. If you need someone to vent at, feel free to PM me. I'm a guy, not a girl, but beyond that (glaringly obvious) difference, your college experience sounds so similar to mine - being quiet and having social anxiety, but enjoying parties nonetheless. For me, I felt it was a personal "hurdle" of sorts. Each time I went out, I could come home and tell myself "at least I wasn't a hermit." I, too, miss that aspect of life, and would like you to know you aren't alone whatsoever in the figurative sense. After a decade of working in kitchens, I was finally starting to feel like I knew how to have/cultivate a conversation with a stranger, and a year of this bullshit has taken me back to square one in that regard.</p>
<p>I hope you can find the energy to get outside and get yourself some sunshine. Even if you aren't exercising regularly right now, just taking a short walk and breathing some fresh air can be so helpful for clearing negative thoughts. I've had many times in my life when exercise was a regular habit, and just as many times when I got out of that habit. Each time, it only took a week or two to undo months (or even years) of work. No matter. You are moving <em>forward</em>. And you've done it before, so you already know how to get there. But be kind to yourself. There is a fine balance to be drawn between pushing ourselves to maintain our health (physical and mental), and counterproductively beating ourselves up for failing to maintain in this or that way. Those negative thoughts don't belong in your life. Fuck them. They don't define who you are, and even more importantly, they don't define who you can become. Same goes for social skills for those of us who struggle that way, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Remember, some of us are actually in this together!</p>

        <p>Okay I commented on your uni post, I really want to help with this while being respectful, and not wanting to belittle your depression or your habit of thinking along a depressing track (that's what it is in many cases) , the game is called Focus. You have to focus on something that inspires you and think of it like a rubber band ball that you can start out very small, but your goal is to just get the positivity ball slightly bigger every hour of the day. </p>
<p>There is a system that super elites use which you can apply to anything, which really will help, which is reading books - listening to audio courses (like Tony Robbins "Get The Edge", "Your Wish Is Your Command," you can find tons of them on youtube), and attending events with likeminded people or virtual events. </p>
<p>If you engage in these 3 things on a daily basis you can get your positivity ball really big really fast. The hardest part is, you have to Give yourself permission to have fun and to have a good time. The way I do it is I realize that just being positive and centered, I'm able to help other people feel good, which is huge in the current climate. So it's actually a humanitarian act of goodwill just to be happy. A lot of people feel guilty being happy or having a good time right now, because they feel like they should be suffering as much as everyone else. But that's just a recipe to keep us all trapped in hell. Imagine if every 3rd person you saw on the street was glowing and in love. And just everywhere you went, you constantly got a quick hit of love and gratitude and inspiration just from walking past them. YOU CAN BE THAT PERSON FOR OTHERS! It's almost like a martial art. Please feel free to DM if you want specific suggestions of more books, audio courses etc. I used to think that stuff was cheesey but it's pure gold right now and can literally save lives.</p>
