    <strong>A Note On Reddit &amp; Bots: Yes, they're probably real</strong>
    <p><p>Alright so this is a little nugget of information that I share with people in my personal circle and would like to pass along to you. It's probably common knowledge to most already, but fuck it.</p>
<p>So, Tencent is one of Reddit's top shareholders: <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/08/tencent-invests-social-platform-reddit.aspx">https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/02/08/tencent-invests-social-platform-reddit.aspx</a>. They're a Chinese company that usually is involved with the gaming space but they are taking major positions in various social media companies (one can only speculate as to why).</p>
<p>A quick duckduckgo search yields this: <a href="https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html">https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/en/index.html</a> (NLP = Natural Language Processing). Now, I'm not an expert in NLP, but I do understand the fundamentals of it and have my finger on the pulse of what the state of the art is in similar fields that I am an expert in. When I see titles like "Recurrent Chunking Mechanisms for Long-Text Machine Reading Comprehension" or "Generate, Delete and Rewrite: A Three-Stage Framework for Improving Persona Consistency of Dialogue Generation", among their <strong>many</strong> publications on the subject of NLP, while I haven't read the publications themselves, it's easy to infer that they're working on bots that are able to at the very least understand language (in fact the technology to do that has been around for a while, it's not new by any means, and it's widely available).</p>
<p>It is not, by any means at all, outlandish to assume that they have bots capable of the following (in order of ease of implementation/efficacy):</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding sentiment of posts (ie: this is a post that fits the narrative, this is a post that doesn't) and upvoting/downvoting en masse depending on what narrative is being pushed. This is actually pretty easy and anyone with an intermediate understanding of AI could use open-source tools to do this. Not at all unreasonable to think this.</li>
<li>Same as above, but replies with some pre-written response depending whether or not it makes sense to do so. This would be tougher to keep under wraps because you'd start seeing the same posts being made over and over again as well as off-context replies. What is more likely though is that they combine a result of "this post is talking about a vaccine positively" and then piggyback/signal boost that comment with more canned "vaccine = good" responses + upvotes that aren't meant to actually start a dialogue but rather to trick people into thinking that the general public thinks a certain way</li>
<li>All of the above except the bot can actually curate a convincingly human response and engage in a dialogue with a person. This is tricky to pull off at a large scale and as far as I know is still an open problem in NLP but given enough data and hardware you could probably make it work. I doubt that they would go this far though since upvotes + signal boosting comments are really all that's necessary to push a narrative, no need to actually engage with people. People will see "oh look, everyone thinks xyz, I should think that too" without actually talking about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To top everything off, the bots don't even really need to be perfect - everyone is reading comments under the assumption that a human is writing them, and will chock any inconsistencies up to bad grammar/quirks in writing style most likely. </p>
<p>I will say that I don't have any confirmation that Tencent is actually implementing these things in Reddit, but they're not researching NLP for no reason. I tend to take it as a certainty that bots do exist on Reddit and are being used to push a narrative because it's always good to take stuff that you read with a grain of salt. The reason I'm posting this to this sub (I'll post it on others as well) is to reinforce the idea that what we see on here is likely not representative of the general public when it comes to opinion on lockdowns or vaccines or anything for that matter.</p></p>

        <p>Great post. It really is important to get this message out. Here are two things to add:</p>
<p>1.
 https://www.cbsnews.com/news/48-million-twitter-accounts-bots-university-of-southern-california-study/</p>
<p>This article is from 2017, things are far worse now.</p>
<p>2.
 https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1001</p>
<p>California is the only state to pass a law making it illegal to pretend chatbots are people. The law is ineffective since it can't be enforced, but it helps people understand that this is a real threat.</p>

        <p>Fantastic input. Also if the bot is created in a non-california IP I wonder if it counts. Probably not, I'd imagine</p>

<p>NLP stands also for Neuro Linguistic Programming, which is a hardcore branch of psychology if you want to look it up. </p>

        <p>Look at what something that is probably pretty primitive, the game AI Dungeon, is capable of in this space. Now take that to the state of the art, and of course it's not just possible, but likely.</p>
