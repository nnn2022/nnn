    <strong>Long term consequences of constant sanitizer use.</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this question. </p>
<p>Are there any negative long term effects of using sanitizer unnecessarily over an extended period of time? I always remember being told not to use sanitizer all the time because of antibacterial resistance. Is there a possibility of that happening with the constant sanitizing most places are doing?</p></p>

<p>So yes. In order to kill covid, we're increasing the likelihood of everything else mutating for its own survival.</p>

        <p>Some sanitizers do that much more easily than others. If they're basically poison for bacteria, a mutant might be less susceptible to that particular poison and you can end up with a resistant strain. Sanitizers that work by physically destroying germs, and work on both bacteria and viruses, are much less prone to that because the germ would have to completely change what its coating is made of and a simple mutation won't be enough.</p>
<p>Luckily nobody (I hope) is trying to use antibacterials to slow viral transmissions. </p>
<p>Coronaviruses in particular have delicate shells and can be damaged with ordinary soap.</p>

        <p>The whole sanitizer thing is just insane. Living a clinically sterile life should never be the goal.</p>
<p>For anyone that has a normal immune system, basic hygiene and common sense is all you need.</p>
<p>From the moment you wake up and get out of bed, you face risks in life. When you step outside and interact with the world, you face risks. Your immune system is well equipped to protect you (not sure why the world collectively forgot all about this).</p>
<p>This includes contact to bacteria and viruses, to the order of <em>trillions</em>. You're constantly inhabited by and coming in contact with them everywhere. </p>
<p>This fear that has been instilled in people that there's an invisible contagion <em>everywhere</em> and we have to remain absolutely sterile and isolated at all times to be "safe" is beyond misguided and far more dangerous than any virus.</p>
<p>You can't <em>not</em> have long term effects from widespread over-use of sanitizer any more than you can't not have long term effects from obliterating the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people and forcing an entire generation of children to wear masks and fear other children and feel guilt for being part of a chain of infection. We will be dealing with the consequences of this lunacy for decades to come. Over use of sanitizer is sure to be among the problems.</p>

        <p>Can confirm. Wife is an RN and her hands were covered in blisters for about a month after her hospital mandated that they use hand sanitizer all the time. Which of course increased the likely hood of her getting a disease. She uses it a lot more sparingly now.</p>

        <p>Even washing your hands too frequently with water and soap can cause skin irritation. This winter I washed my hands far less than usual (because I've basically stayed at home the whole time, so my hands didn't get particularly dirty) and my skin has been in perfect condition. So much better than other years.</p>

        <p>Ugh please don't even remind me of MRSA! My mother-in-law has it, probably C Diff too, and I'm terrified of <em>smelling</em> like her someday. That's why it pisses me off so much that people are buying up all the disinfectant wipes. I'm far from the most hygienic person, my feet probably look like Toph's feet from Avatar: The Last Airbender, but I make goddamn sure to disinfect the toilet after my mother-in-law uses it.

        <p>this is true - a couple months into this my husband tried to clean his bathroom using *only* bleach and rubbing alcohol and he didn't turn the fan on and he thought he was having an asthma attack and i was like, "you fucking dumbass, you're supposed to dilute the chemicals and have a fan or a window open, ideally both. are you trying to kill yourself?" he didn't know that, and i'm sure a lot of these other newfound paranoid germaphobes don't either.</p>
<p>people literally have no idea what they're doing with this stuff and have no common sense. (my husband falls into the no common sense, never cleaned a bathroom before category, which is embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as being a doomer.)</p>

        <p>I only use it at the gym.  After my workouts if the locker room sinks were not available cause half the time the sinks are busted lol.  But that’s the gym that’s normal   I never really used it. Just soap and even then I wouldn’t scrub my hands every 20 minutes.  When I use the bathroom, when my hands are filthy and after I eat   Normal stuff.  So many times I’d be walking around the mall touching clothes, phones at the Apple store or whatever and then go eat without washing my hands.  You need this germs in life.</p>

        <p>I think sanitizer is anti-microbial rather than anti-bacterial so some of the antibiotic resistance theories don’t carry over as well but I do know that a lot of the sanitizers that are off-brands and rapidly made overseas without proper oversight are being recalled for using methanol, which is highly toxic and can cause serious health issues.</p>

        <p>Right now don’t use any of it unless you have some like Purell from long before the shortages. </p>
<p>A lot of cheap sanitizers are being made with wood alcohol and other deadly ingredients and the FDA is slacking on monitoring that.  </p>
<p>Do not buy those weird brands you’ve never heard of or brands that aren’t known for sanitizer that suddenly popped up.    </p>
<p>Don’t even buy suave or known brands but they aren’t known for hand sanitizer.   The real companies that make it like Purell are sold out for a reason.  Some shitty company that didn’t exist a few months ago or never made sanitizer before doesn’t suddenly have great ingredients and factories for it when worldwide known brands that exist only to make sanitizer have shortages.  These new shitty ones are inferior at best and most likely have dangerous ingredients to make up for the lack of proper ones.   </p>
<p>I tried a couple of new ones and at best they just made my hands sticky.   Why exactly would so called ethyl alcohol which in all other cases is DRYING make my skin sticky?   Because they aren’t saying what’s in it. </p>
<p>These facts are from recent news reports. Google it.  </p>
<p>It is risky to use the ones that are out now.   Please just use soap and water.</p>
