    <strong>Do people actually get mad at you when you don't wear a mask in a business?</strong>
    <p><p>I mean I'm sure they would in like LA, NYC, or one of the ultra-blue commie shithole cities</p>
<p>But like I'm just done, I'm never wearing a mask again. Has anyone encountered anyone actually getting confrontational for someone not wearing a mask that's not in a big city/metro area?</p></p>

        <p>I live an hour north of Minneapolis, do most shopping between home and half way to Minneapolis. The closer I get the more masks I see, but there's only one store I frequent that I know they'll tell me to put on a mask or leave. Everywhere else I go no one has said a thing. I've been maskless for about three or four months. Plenty of times I thought someone, employee or customer would say something. But it hasn't happened yet. And as of april 30 Biden's100 days of wearing a mask is over. Then you have a great reason not to. The president says we don't have to anymore.</p>

        <p>Upper midwest here. I’ve never masked up during this whole ordeal except on an airplane to Florida last June. I’ve only gotten a couple weird looks but not once has anyone ever confronted me.</p>

        <p>I only mask up if there is a sign at the door. The reason is, they could simply ask that I leave and I must, since I open carry. I figure if I don't wear the mask, they can ask that I leave and they are already probably triggered by the level of 2A freedom im exposing to them.</p>

        <p>Blue state here. I forgot my mask running out of the rain and into a restaurant to meet my parents. there was about 6 seconds of distance to cover between the entrance and where my parents were sitting.  within that window of 6 seconds, a waiter immediately noticed and snapped at me that “you couldn’t just walk in here like that!”  Both of the front hosts were busy helping other people so they didn’t even notice.  A random waiter walking by was that bothered by my maskless face, which I was even trying to conceal with my high jacket collar and long hair.  I really 
, really despise these people.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I quit going to Natural Grocers recently. I never bothered anyone about it when I worked there but some kid got all puffed up last time I went in. I did get him to admit that he's been trained to harass customers now, walked away laughing at least.</p>

        <p>In western oregon almost everyone still wears a mask to shop. Some rural gas stations/bars you can get away without wearing a mask but most businesses/ customers will ask you to leave if you dont put one on. Portland is real strict. A nice breakfast restaurant that i went to on the coast stayed open during the pandemic and got fined just under 20k for penalties. Best breakfast I bout ever had in my life after a year of lockdown.</p>
