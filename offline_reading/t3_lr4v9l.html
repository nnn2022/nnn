    <strong>Everything the Science Has Gotten Wrong Since This Pandemic Has Started.</strong>
    <p><p>This is for all of the people who say to "listen to the science".</p>
<p>The science has said.</p>
<p>We need just 2 weeks to flatten the curve.
Actually this'll be over by the summer.
Actually we need more time but once we flatten the curve we can go back to normal.
Actually we need to wait for a vaccine.
Actually no restrictions will change with the vaccine.
All we need to do is wear masks and then we can reopen everything.
Coronaviruses don't mutate so once we have a vaccine we're good.
There won't be a vaccine as there has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus before this.
We need to close everything because the combination of covid and the flu will overwhelm the healthcare system.
The vaccine will only be 70% effective.
Natural herd immunity has never worked without a vaccine before this so we must stay closed.
Lockdowns prevent covid.
Super inaccurate models.</p>
<p>Please comment if I've missed any. These people need to take their "science" and shove it up their ass.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry for the bad formatting I'm on mobile.</p>
<p>Edit2: There is no human to human transmission.</p></p>

        <p>This kind of fits the bill:</p>
<p>NYT January 8th: "There is no evidence that the virus is readily spread by humans"</p>
<p>WHO January 14: On Twitter "Peliminary investigations have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China</p>
<p>January 21: We get the very first reported coronavirus patient reported in the US: CDC</p>
<p>January 22: Dr. Fauci told Newsmax's Greg Kelly, "This is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is notsomething that the citizens of the United States should be worried about right now."</p>
<p>January 26: Dr. Fauci again, this time in an interview with John Catsimatidis. "It's a very, very low risk to the United States"</p>
<p>January 28: BuzzFeed News, "Don't worry about the Coronavirus. Worry about the Flu."</p>
<p>January 31: Vox News on Twitter "Is this going to be a deadly pandemic? No."</p>
<p>January 31: The Washington Post, "How our brains make Coronavirus seem scarier than it is"</p>
<p>Janurary 31: Trump, in direct defiance to the liberal media, liberal politicians, and WHO, begins blocking travel to and from China.</p>
<p>He gets called xenophobic and paranoid by several people in the democratic party. This can be looked up on Google very easily.</p>
<p>January 31: CNN "As the Coronavirus spreads, fear is fueling racism and xenophobia"</p>
<p>February 2nd: NYC Health Commissioner "...the risk to New Yorkers for Coronavirus is low and our city preparedneess is high. There is no reason not to take the subway, not to take the bus..."</p>
<p>February 3: The Washington Post, "Why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to Coronavirus"</p>
<p>February 5: The New York Times, "Who says it's not safe to travel to China? The Coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn't work anyway."</p>
<p>On February 24, Pelosi told people that Chinatown was safe and that she hoped people would come to hang out. She and everyone else was there without masks and told people to come join her.</p>
<p>February 26: New york Times "Let's call it Trumpvirus. If you're feeling awful, you kno who to blame."</p>
<p>March 2: Bill de Blasio on Twitter, "Since I'm encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus, I thought I would offer some suggestions. Here's the first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see "The Traitor" u/FilmLinc. If "The Wire" was a true story + set in Italy, it would be this film.</p>
<p>March 2: NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, "...when you're saying what happened in other countries vs. what happened here, we don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries."</p>
<p>March 4: CNN Anderson Cooper tells people to be more concerned about the flu than the coronavirus.</p>
<p>March 9: Forbes states, "Covid-19 travel update: Fauci says cruising is ok if you are healthy."</p>
<p>President Trump sent a Naval Hospital Ship to New York and California. He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds. He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York. Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that. He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals. This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>

        <p>It's extremely hard to believe that these epidemiologists still don't know that covid isn't a horrible plague...that it is a 0.15% IFR (infection fatality rate) respiratory virus, which has an average mortality age over 80...that this is how every common cold virus originated. You don't believe they actually know those things? I mean come on, you really fall for their little playing dumb act? They knew a bunch of things prior to March 2020 that they magically don't know anymore. Funny how that works. It's been clear for a long time now that they are full of shit, that they are shamelessly sullying the name of science, and they do not care. They clearly want to LARP an apocalyptic pandemic and they don't care that they have flushed decades of established science down the toilet or any of the immense harm they are complicit in causing (the enormous lockdown damage, billions of masks ending up in the ocean, kids lost a year of education &amp; social development, etc.). Scientists should have been the first ones speaking out against this false narrative, not shamelessly spreading quackery. Instead, the vast majority of them are complicit in this, and have made science a meaningless term with all the clownery they chose to embrace. The few scientists that did speak out were quickly dismissed and silenced. Gee, I wonder why. </p>
<p>But this really isn't the first time that people in science and medical professions have been willing to sully the name of science for their own political ideologies. This whole covid bullshit is just on the most massive scale they ever did it. When this happens, it also creates the phenomenon of those that dare speak out any logic, sense, and truth are ostracized, ridiculed, and silenced...the quacks therefore come out and try to discredit them, dismiss <em>them</em> as the "quacks" and "nutjobs". This quickly leads to many just choosing to not speak out for fear of having their careers and reputations destroyed.</p>
