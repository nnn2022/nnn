    <strong>I don’t know how much longer I can stand my friends bugging/urging me to get the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>Admittedly, this is a rant post.</p>
<p>In the early months of 2021, this wasn’t an issue, but became worse as the news began spouting a negative stigma of unvaccinated people and I just want it to stop. Every time i’m out with them the topic of vaccines comes up at least once. The conversation is always targeted towards me because i’m the only one that refuses to get it.</p>
<p>“It’s your responsibility!”
“You need to so you don’t have to wear a mask any more”
“It’s just a shot, why are you so scared?”
“You need it to go back to college”</p>
<p>I keep my response as basic as possible to refrain from getting into an actual argument as I don’t like arguing.</p>
<p>“I don’t want it and I don’t need it”</p>
<p>Look, they can make their choice to get vaccinated and I’m totally fine with it. Hell, it might even be pretty effective, but please for the love of all things holy I just want them to stop bringing it up. They talk like I’m missing out on a free iPhone 11 at CVS. The news is slowly and steadily making things worse and nothing is worse than knowing it’s a sham and watching the world go downhill with it. </p>
<p>I’m glad there are people here that I can tell this to and not be seen as a crazy person. I appreciate all of you existing.</p></p>

        <p>I say the same thing to every single person who tries to harass me about masks, injections, or anything else. "Just focus on yourself, and don't tell me what the fuck to do". I just say this in a raised voice. It works very well. Once in a while, the sheep just won't get it the first time I say it, and they will continue bitching. When they do this, I say it again, but with even more force. After this, they never harass me again. I have said this to so many people at this point that I have lost count. It is very easy to shut the sheep up. You need to just remember that they are afraid of you. Use that fear against them.</p>

        <p>Whoa now, let's not spread misinformation. That's the overall fatality rate including old, sick people.</p>
<p>OP said something about college, so we should assume early 20s, and they sound otherwise healthy. OP's "chance of surviving" is probably more like 99.99% (literally, based on CDC figures).</p>

        <p>yeah I was at my choir yesterday and i suspect i may be the only unvaccinated there. Someone asked me about it and I said what I always say. That i dont feel the need to get vaxxed yet and prefer to wait. Our choir director started up with that "you know you can get really sick right?"-BS. Like, dude, I'ma healthy woman in my early 20's with no other conditions and i never ever get sick. I think I'll be fine. And also, why is it any business of yours?   </p>
<p>I calculated my risk of hospitalization/death with a  <a href="https://qcovid.org/Calculation">tool from Oxford</a> and i had like a 0,003 chance of death and a 0.0118 chance of hospitalization.   </p>
<p>I 'll take that risk.</p>

        <p>I've had conversations with people and put them right. Told them that people still die and spread it after getting vaccinated so I'm not going to have a vaccine that doesn't work. I tell them I take vitamin D, zinc and eat lots of fruit. And I'm not overweight either so I'll be just fiiiiine. </p>
<p>I don't give a shit what anyone thinks anymore. Everyone I know knows I'm never having the vaccine and the reasons why. My family, my workmates and my friends. </p>
<p>Only my auntie is a bitch about it. It's been her dream year because she's a hypochondriac! She came round when I was at my mom's to drop something off last week. Her and her husband were both wearing masks in the car, she rang the bell and then stepped back a metre because my mom isn't vaccinated and will never be.</p>

        <p>You might want to show them this. Latest stats out of the UK -- 43% of people that have just died of the Delta variant (supposedly) had BOTH shots.</p>
<p>Worked for them, didn't it?</p>

        <p>People who are now trying to rationalize why they themselves were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Expect more of this as more people realize they were lied to by their governments and basically used as lab rats.</p>
<p>Sad, but this is what the majority of people will probably do to make themselves feel better.</p>
<p>Until, of course, the news media turns against these vaccines -- and they <em>will</em> as more and more people stop reading their articles pushing the current panic and fear. After all, it's all about making the most money from the garbage they write, and has never been about 'informing' the public.</p>
<p>That's when they will begin writing the millions of future articles about the shit show that was the Covid vaccine, so they can recoup the massive number of views they used to get when the Covid panic first begin.</p>
<p>When that happens, the shit really will hit the fan.</p>

        <p>It's also actually 60% of people that died had had at least ONE shot so, in effect, you've less chance of dying without a vaccine than with one.</p>

        <p>UK is at 48% fully vaccinated, so they're slightly underrepresented at 43%. That said, that's not much risk reduction, and certainly not enough to justify the massive campaign for vaccination. </p>
<p>More lives would undoubtedly be saved by using those same resources to mobilize campaigns for general immune system health factors such as vitamins, diet, and exercise. I know that's not as easy as just getting injected, but if those numbers are reliable, then it's just the truth.</p>

        <p>Thank you. Apparently I have a 0.0004% chance of death and a 0.0201% chance of hospitalization.  I like those odds. And since it's still possible to catch and spread it after "vaccination" it's not like it helps anyone else, so I'll stick with my natural immune system.</p>

        <p>Yep. My work never lifted the mask requirement even for the lab rats. So still no point. Everyone even had to go in for a respirator mask fitting a few weeks ago. And everyone still has to take covid tests every once in awhile. It's just insanity here. I read a comment from a troll a while ago that most of the world has already gone back to normal so we need to "get over it." Um, excuse me! This is not normal, not by any stretch.</p>

        <p>This is really Dreadful, I went through the same thing. I live in New York City and I work in healthcare. As you might imagine those two things have put me on the hot seat in a big way. At first I managed to get people to leave me alone by taking a page out of their book and being an obnoxious virtue signaler. I can't get it until every vulnerable person who is at a greater risk than me has had theirs, I will wait! I found that when I said that it immediately made them stop . But now it's very easy to get and everyone who wants it has gotten it. One friend of mine kept asking and I told her my PCP and rheumatologists both suggested I wait. She stopped asking now it's at the point where I don't give a shit. Stop  pestering me it's not going to happen. My job has gone almost fully remote now, they are saying we only have to come in twice a year. I'm going to be safe for a few more months. We have the vaccine passport here but I don't give a crap about Bruce Springsteen or the Foo Fighters or anyone else that makes insane demands on me having a medical procedure in order to attend events. As far as travel I will drive wherever I want to go until they inflict this whole climate thing on us and start making it harder to do that.</p>
<p>You have different approaches you could take, you could be honest and keep doing what you're doing which I think is the best. If you just want them to shut up and you want to keep them in your life, tell them you got it. This may be awkward though if you're someplace where you need it to get in. My feelings on this are if people stop wanting to be friends with us because of our medical status they are legitimately awful people and I don't want them in my life. If it's a safety thing and they are still scared? I can't be around people this neurotic at this point. Life is full of risks, it's a risk going out to eat, getting in a car and turning on the ignition. For our entire lives it was a risk eating birthday cake after someone blew out the candles. I am sorry that this triggered OCD and so many people but I'm tired of being held hostage like this. I have lost friends over the past year because of this and I'm realizing that it's okay. I'm going to make new friends. We will be on the same page and I won't have to constantly be stressed out around them and hiding parts of myself.</p>

<p>Whatever the media is blasting away at, the people think is OK to discuss.</p>
<p>They don't understand privacy etc. I mean you could just tell everyone to fuck off but then you'll have no friends at all. You can't expect all your friends to be perfect and super intelligent. You have to deal with and forgive them of their quirks etc</p>

<p>People who aren't sheep do still exist. They are just very hard to find. The op may be friendless for a while but it's better than having "friends" who try to pressure you into taking drugs. Sounds like the same kind of people that schools warn you about. "Dont do drugs kids."</p>

        <p>Ask them where they went to medical school, because it sounds like they're trying to become your primary care physician. Since there's a 99.99999% they didn't go to medical school, it usually shuts them up. "If you're trying to become my doctor I want to make sure you at least went to a decent medical school." or "Listen, I already have a primary care doctor for my medical decisions and I'm not looking for a new one right now thanks!"</p>

<p>People used used to talk about the weather, now it's about your medical status. I'm getting very tired of it. I visited my mum and a neighbour had asker her if I was vaccinated, she told them no and the woman's response was "I thought he would have got it to protect you, you need to tell him", thankfully my mother said she was vaccinated and that I make my own choices. </p>

        <p>A lot of people here are quick to say “ditch your friends and get new ones” but I don’t think that’s a good idea. They sound like good friends but they are brainwashed by the media.</p>
<p>So if I were you I’d get them to start questioning things. Like, why would they lock everything down over some virus that has over a 99% survival rate for the vast majority of people? Why are they making everyone wear masks even though they aren’t effective. Why are they giving incentives to take the vaccine if it really works? If it prevents transmission by reducing symptoms then that means asymptomatic spread is a lie, used as justification for locking everything down. Also if you have symptoms of a virus then just stay home? That is just common sense you don’t need the jab.</p>
<p>I hope you can get your friends on your side without losing any. Best of luck</p>

Went from watching the hill (now breaking points), Joe Rogan, and Bret Weinstein. When they didn't contract trace the first case in Washington from China. And then we were one of the first states to have an outbreak not long after that. Then Bret and his Heather have opened my eyes to the wuhan lab situation, how studies can be twisted/worded weird/biased, health experts, ivermectin, and the vaccines. They are genuine and are mostly careful on what they say. (I take everything with a grain of salt)
I do feel alone a lot though, thinking maybe I AM going crazy or have been suckered into this thinking. It's hard to sleep.
Sorry for the rant!</p>

        <p>You're not crazy, and you're not alone.  I also follow Darkhorse and Breaking Points.  </p>
<p>People like us are looking for authenticity.  We want to hear people who are willing to examine both sides of an issues in a way that sounds reasonalbe.  </p>
<p>We are rightfully suspicious of the covid regime because of the obvious cover-ups.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately we are a minority.  Our opponents are our friends, families, and co-workers.  They can't be changed, and they can't be reasoned with.  They have given into binary thinking.  </p>
<p>Stay strong.  I've decided that I have to find like-minded friends, and I have to leave my comfort zone to do that.  We have to support each other.</p>

        <p>I can relate to your dilemma. I don't think ditching your friends or lying about your vaccination status is the answer.  I've been tempted to do both and am so happy that I was true to myself and kept defending my choice to not get the vaccine (I had Covid and have natural antibodies, and literally do not need the vaccine).  I was able to identify my true friends, and my family is finally coming around now too. I hope your friends will eventually become bored with the topic or start to accept your position.  They just have to decide if they still like you even though you've made a choice they don't understand.  There is literally no reason to rush into getting an experimental vaccine. It will always be there if you should ever decide your risk factors have changed, but you can't undo it once you've taken it.</p>
<p>I would suggest sticking to your guns and answering with the fact that you've weighed your personal risks and it's less risky to you, personally, to not get the vaccine but you are happy they feel better that they have gotten it.  Eventually they will stop bringing it up, and if they don't, unfortunately they aren't your real friends.</p>

        <p>interesting.</p>
<p>if i would get annoyed like that, i would have a discussion, until they gave up and either see the truth or give up completely.</p>
<p>however a question needs to get asked, whether those are real friends, when they are pushing you to get an experimental extremely harmful poison injection.</p>
<p>maybe you could setup an actual data based discussion, which they can't win of course under the clear point, that this should stop any future insane push at you to get a poison injection.</p>
<p>and maybe they would stop afterwards.</p>
<p>but honestly if they won't stop, just look for sane people or saner people at least, who respect your freedoms and choices a LOT more.</p>

        <p>Same with my girlfriend's family. They are discreet about it but every time they are alone with their daughters because they know my view on this they subtly ask her and push her to get it so much now she's thinking about... I hate how things are right now I hope people wake up when another lockdown happens because of the Delta variant regardless of vaccination status before people turn on the unvaccinated with torches.</p>

        <p>It’s shame that you got shitty friends as friends are suppose to respect your decision but not to harass you so they can feel safe and be “morally” right, my advise is to ditch them if they continue. Regarding myself my friends knows I’m not getting it and they can’t ever change my mind as I’m quite stubborn and I’ll lose my shit if I feel harassed or threatened. Got few vaccinated friends but it seems they are ok with my decision or are too afraid I don’t know but I don’t care either way it works for me</p>

        <p>I shut people down as soon as they try and guilt me for not getting it. I refer them to the VAERS website and then bring up the Harvard study that says that only 10% of adverse reactions are probably even reported. Then I tell them that COVID has a 99+% chance of survival if you don't have any pre-existing conditions. If that doesn't work, I mention the last SARS vaccine killed 6 people and it was pulled. If none of that keeps them quiet on the subject, then I just ghost them. Fuck them for not respecting my own private health decisions.</p>

        <p>I would keep these "friends" on an arm's length. They might be the ones who will shell you out at some point. My rule is to never let people who know me to know anything negative about me, becasue all humans will stab you to the back because you can't underestimate how loyal these people are to their brainwashing.</p>
<p>If someone asks me am I vaccinated I take that as them asking me to lie to them, and hence I do what is told. It's kind of like your boss asking "what are your negatives as an employee". The even person with 2 brain cells knows to lie in that situation so why can't people when these government goons do the same with the latest government enslavement? You just answer them that "Yes. I do everything as my government recommends and I never question science".</p>

        <p>I have a few friends who are pretty all-in on the fear. I’m not. They’re aware of this, and do sometimes want to pick my brain on why I feel the way I do. The trick is, I actually have answers and refutes to their counter arguments. To the point that I’m even causing them to rethink their stances on the last year. </p>
<p>If your friends are absolutist, then you have bigger issues than a vaccine. If your friends are true friends, you should be able to disagree and continue drinking a beer together.</p>

        <p>Those aren't friends!
You see friends respect each other and stay out of each other's personal business when it's obvious they're opinion on something isn't wanted or agreed with. True Friends can agree to disagree and remain friends.</p>

        <p>Pufff your friends are very intrusive... I mean most of my friends disagree with me regarding this topic but at least there's mutual respect between us and no one forces anyone. Maybe it's because where I live people aren't so scared of covid anymore not as if they question the current narrative or something like that (unfortunately) but more as if they're like "okay life's going on we can't keep beingbscared of this anymore"</p>

        <p>While I usually wouldn't advise it in this sorta situation where they are trying to peer pressure you into putting something experimental in your body and they won't take no as an answer i'd probably just infer or outrigtht say their being Nazis.</p>
<p>The main goal being to shut them up, they might also get super offended and hostile but either way you'd probably be showing them that there's no point in trying to pressure you into getting it.</p>
