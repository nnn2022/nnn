        <p>What about when you first heard about coronavirus? </p>
<p>I’m in the UK, and I recall hearing about it in China - just from academics around the university talking about it being on the news. This was probably end of Feb/ beginning of March. Then the chat of it started dominating every conversation, you know, in the same way general elections etc do. Then I was balls deep in my thesis for a while so didn’t really speak to anyone. Suddenly, it was in the UK and we were going into lockdown. </p>
<p>Obv I don’t know what country you’re in and thus what the very beginning looked like for you...</p>

        <p>I’m also from the UK, I also stopped believing when nobody was dropping dead in the streets like it was shown in the media, when “overrun” NHS workers had time to make TIKTOK dance videos &amp; when the lockdowns felt rushed and staged.</p>
<p>This hoax has also got me questioning the truth of historical events, ie was the plague or another touchy event actually that bad? Or have we just believed the narrative and figures we were taught.</p>

        <p>I help doctors and scientists prepare studies for publication. My clients are non-native English speakers and most are from China.</p>
<p>So, I was talking with the doctors and healthcare professionals throughout the lead-up to the outbreak in Canada and elsewhere (and still do today, including many people who run clinical trials and develop medicine and vaccines). I was not speaking to anyone directly involved in handling the situation in China, so all second-hand knowledge at that time.</p>
<p>Based on what I was hearing in January and February, when we were starting lockdowns, I was pretty worried. The death rate seemed to be about 5% and one of the most famous victims was a doctor in his early 40s.</p>
<p>When Trump started talking about Hydrochloroquine, I asked some of the doctors there what they thought of it. One's own mother had been treated with it and recovered (in her 80s) and we watched the death rate plummet in China at this time. Since, the death rate in China dropped down to 1 death in 4000 infections.</p>
<p>A report came out of Italy last summer saying that as of September of 2019, 11% of one city in Italy had already had covid. But it went completely unnoticed. The authors said, it was noted that the flu season was worse than usual; but there were no reports of this in the Italian press for this period.</p>
<p>If 11% of the population had a disease and spread it with abandon but it went completely unnoticed for 6 months, then how bad could it be?</p>
<p>At the same time, we had already had whistleblowers in New York hospitals saying they were killing the patients with ventilators (something that China had stopped doing and greatly decreased the death rate after stopping) and neglect. NYC was showing 27% seroprevalance for covid antibodies, other's had innate immunity and the death rate, despite the government's best efforts to increase it by paying for covid cases (and deaths) was still around flu levels.</p>
<p>So, last year, multiple indicators showed that covid was either as bad or safer than the flu. Nothing indicated it was worse. Nothing except the government's response which was not changed or adjusted despite the obvious low death rate from the disease.</p>

        <p>I was.  I'm an "essential worker" so I been out there since day one.  I was the idiot wearing a mask and using nitrile gloves to pump gas or open doors.</p>
<p>I did my best not to panic, but when I would hear our supervisors talking about us like chess pieces, I would flip out and lose my shit.</p>
<p>I noticed we were stuck out on the front lines, but the hospital we work at was empty.  They got so few patients they started sending staff home or calling to tell them not to come in.</p>
<p>Then the ridiculous rules for reopening started.  I went to a bar and ordered a drink.  The bartender asked me what kind of chips I wanted, and i said I didn't want any.  She told me they HAD to serve chips with the drinks in order to stay open.  So basically covid could tell if I had a beer with or without chips.  That's what solidified my stance on this whole thing being complete bullshit.</p>

        <p>I wwasn't  worried at first before it reached my country. A few days after the first cases in my country i left to go on holiday to Egypt. And i was fully convinced by the time i returned from my 22 day trip it would all be over and done.</p>
<p>While on Holiday i got a bad cold  and didn't feel too hot for a few days and people kinda treated me like a leper whenever i sneezed or blew my nose. Which weirded me out.  But i got better within a few days. Then like 10 days in or so we got word that we would be forced to fly home by the travel agent that day cause Egypt was closing its borders.</p>
<p>That made me a bit worried, but mostly confused. I assumed "okay well something kinda bad must be going on then, best comply". So we went home and for a little over 2 weeks my life kinda stopped. I couldn't go to my internship, i couldn't go to scouts or choir, i didnt see anyone. And after about 2 weeks i was like "well okay time is up, the two weeks to flatten the curve are over, let's go back to normal now. "</p>
<p>After that my sketicism only got stronger. They started reccomending masks, then demanding masks in public transport. Professors of law came in the news saying that "nooo a wider mask mandat is absolutely impossible in The Netherlands, our constitution doenst allow for that."Then we got wider mask mandates anyway.   Then I wasnt allowed to visit my grandma in her care home as she was dying. I didn't have a proper graduation cermony. When my grandma died and then my granddad (both not from covid) we were only allowed to have tiny services. Then we got a curfew and werent allowed to buy alcohol after 8 PM.</p>
<p>An actual judge ruled that all of  this was unlawful and that the "covid emergency law was not legal and all fines given under it must be overturned" and the government went "fuck you judge-who-has-studied-actual-law we do what we want"</p>
<p>And every step of the way, every transgression, every extra measures, my skepticism got stronger.</p>
<p>I was fine with putting my life on hold for 2 weeks, that was a small price to pay in my mind.  Washing my hands and distancing was fine too at the time and made sense.  But everything after that is what changed my opinions and what pushes me further and further into the resistance.</p>

        <p>Sad to hear about your grandparents.</p>
<p>I have a very similar experience, I also live in NL. When they started with the "temporary" lockdown to flatten the curve, that's when I started doubting things.</p>
<p>So many things that didn't make sense, but instead of seeing people around me also questioning things, I saw mostly conformity to the state. Very different from the "liberal, open, and free" Netherlands I moved to so long ago...</p>

        <p>I believe they should be open, but safer for you to check that with the actual hotel.</p>
<p>On the 26th they dropped the majority of lockdown rules, however masks are still required on public transport. https://nltimes.nl/2021/06/26/full-list-coronavirus-restrictions-june-26</p>

        <p>I never once got scared. When they shut down the university in early March 2021, I went STRAIGHT to the beach to swim. </p>
<p>Why was I not afraid? 6,900+ people were on the ship between 19 and 24 Jan 2020 where \~30 passengers (3 infected) were from Wuhan. ZERO new infections and deaths. Clearly not EbolAIDS 5000 Extreme Pro Plus and thus nothing to worry about.</p>

        <p>At the outset, I was skeptical, but gave the state the benefit of the doubt, erring on the side of caution.</p>
<p>My mother was of the group allegedly most effected.  60+, multiple co-morbidities.</p>
<p>I took many precautions to prevent her from getting it, but she picked it up from work early on, May 2020.</p>
<p>Once she had it, I didn’t have a reason to not get it.  I was more concerned with the possibility of losing my mom than I was with catching something, even then, I figured would be a discomfort at best.</p>
<p>Mom had symptoms for about two weeks.  I spent about three hours a day with her, close contact.  I made it over to see her about 10 days in the two week period.</p>
<p>I never experienced any symptoms.  My father, also 60+, lost smell/taste for a couple weeks, but no other symptoms.</p>
<p>After seeing the person who was supposed to die survive, I stopped giving the state the benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <p>They didn’t have any real reasons.</p>
<p>They essentially stated that they would only prescribe HCQ for hospitalized patients.  AKA, when it was too late for HCQ to be effective.</p>

        <p>March 2020. I wore a full face respirator...for a biological disease dropping people dead and got made fun of. The same people who laughed at me then when Seattle had 20 cases now have a vax and wear masks like its a religion. You took it out of peer pressure. Not fear of corona.</p>
<p>Watching CPC citizens drop dead, convulse, get knocked out by Bio Ops holding MPLs drag people around. Fake? Real? Don't care anymore imo. I know what I know and explaining it anymore on the internet is futile. I will not take covid any more serious than I did after March 2020 simply out of principle to the rest of those who were sticking their head in the sand when this started and now take it serious. I will gladly admit I was wrong. I legit thought this would cull the Earth. Take some time and check it out.</p>

<p>At this point. I am convinced Covid, was at first a accidental(?) release and did kill people. Aerosoled AIDS/HIV is what I heard it described as almost a year ago. No way all of those are fake. Not a chance. In conjunction with the response force used it makes sense. Since then however, I believe that while covid does exist, it is negligible. We have obfuscated the actual deaths and count numbers to the point nobody can even give you a good indicator. We will see when or if people start dropping dead in a year or two, however there won't be a space on the internet for you to communicate that with so good luck. It's coming for us here in the West and TenCent lapdog reddit is helping the agenda.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the same people who think COVID is going to kill everyone <strong>a year and a half later</strong> are the same people who initially thought that COVID was a big nothing burger.</p>

        <p>I was more scared of the fact that I couldn't find actual essentials (diapers) for my kid. Made me wonder how much prices will soar, if they'll impose even more limits on what and how much you can buy.</p>
<p>But yes, I followed the rules from March to mid-April 2020, naively thinking it'll all blow over by then. </p>
<p>What changed my mind? Our Prime Minister constantly telling people to go home &amp; stay home and himself traveling to a different province with his family for Easter 2020 while the rest of us didn't see family and weren't able to attend church for the holiday.</p>

        <p>I was scared for around a week or two, but was more scared when I saw how they were responding.  Pretty much instantly I saw the potential effects on the economy, society, education, life quality etc.  Fear of the virus paled into insignificance after that.</p>

        <p>I was at first, because I didn’t really know what we were dealing with. After a month or so I realized it wasn’t as big as they were saying it was. And then once my 81 year old grandfather (who doesn’t exercise, has diabetes, a little overweight) got it and was perfectly fine… I knew it was all a joke. My mother helps take care of him and she never got it which was pretty crazy considering they say it’s “so contagious”… I’ve also had several other family and friends get it and it was just a bad cold, no one was hospitalized or died. I know the virus is a real thing but it’s not as deadly as the media is making it out to be.</p>

        <p>As I recall, we had a pretty good idea that it did not affect kids pretty early. I remember dropping my six year old for school on what would wind up being her last week for six months, and her telling me that the teachers were saying scary stuff. I remember telling her that it seemed like she and I would both eventually be infected, and maybe not even know.</p>
<p>I was living in Toronto and traveling a lot in 2003 during SARS. Even younger then, I found a lot of the paranoia laughable, and that was what was brought to mind last Spring. Without really having any kind of understanding of what was happening, I reacted to what seemed like an overreaction to me, by not worrying about it.</p>

        <p>I was skeptical from the start. What confirmed my skepticism was learning that the average age of the people who died in the area of northern Italy that was badly affected, was over 80 years of age, close to their life expectancy. That confirmed that it wasn't going to be as bad as the Spanish Flu outbreak that occurred post WWI, which caused a majority of deaths were in the much younger 18-40 age group, depriving those victims of many years of life.</p>
<p>I've never been afraid of the virus, but I am afraid of the way society is creeping towards an Orwellian dystopia.</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie, absolutely. Life was busy at the beginning of it all for me. Started a new job, had a toddler and a pregnant wife. So, initially, I was a little fearful. As time went on, my wife started doing some research and started to share with me. </p>
<p>I think a lot of people are in or at least were in that boat. Too busy to actually look into it.</p>

        <p>I followed it pretty closely on 4chan starting in November/December of 2019 with Corona-chan posting, and webms of people dropping dead or bleeding on the street and I was just thinking "man China sucks" and I was interested when it came to the US, but then I found out about Event 201 and a week later it became the focus of the talking heads, and I knew it was all fake. Scared? Maybe a little in November of 19. Kinda more just excited we were going to get a real happening, but for the most part I was chill.</p>

<p>As an ardent anticommunist, I was following lots of the anticommunist accounts in Asia, particularly Hong Kong.  Those accounts were used as tools to leak the videos of people dying in mainland China.  I now know it was a psy-op, but to leak those images to the Chinese anticommunists was a smart play on their part.</p>
<p>I lost my fear in May.  The US CDC released massive amounts of data and it became clear that I was more likely to die in an auto accident than from COVID.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t scared but being a commuter on trains into and out of NYC every day I knew there was a good chance I’d get it.</p>
<p>I was right.</p>
<p>I began feeling sick in early April, and it never went away but my fever faded fast.  In early May I woke up with a fever, body aches, chills.  I knew.  Went to urgent care.  Positive pcr test.  It took me until August to feel myself again.  I had a positive antibody test in blood panels both in July and December.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of getting vaccinated in March despite not trusting it, because my wife was getting it and I tried to convince her not to but she ended up making an appointment for us and I caved to the pressure from many people, and regret it deeply.  I feel more fucked up after the Pfizer shots than I did once after clearing Covid.  I’m in my mid 30s and I was feeling great.</p>
<p>After getting vaccinated I had effects that reminded me of Covid, with some new fun features thrown in like bad tinnitus lasting 4 weeks after the 2nd shot.  I developed a UTI as well and I’m male.  Odd.  Never had one of those before.  I feel dizzier than normal, and the body aches and chills I had from long covid actually got worse and hasn’t gotten better at all.</p>
<p>Im not taking any forced booster.   I’m more afraid of this sketchy experimental medicine “vaccine” then I am of another case or Covid, even if it’s worse or some scary “variant.”  My fear of Covid is at literally 0%.  My fear of other people, the government, the vaccine… is far higher.</p>
<p>If I could go back in time I would not get this vaccine and risk the consequences.  I was cowardly.  I knew my employer would mandate the shot, which they did.  Despite being vaccinated I feel a moral obligation not to submit my Covid card as is being requested.</p>
<p>Someone on my team is refusing to get vaccinated.  I never asked them because their vaccination status is private health information, but my boss was asking constantly and I said I don’t think we should be doing that since there’s still HIPAA.  HR agreed and this supervisor was asked to cease and desist.  </p>
<p>The person not getting the shot refuses because their father had an allergic reaction in the room and needed epinephrine.  HR laughed at their rationale in a private meeting.  Fact is they don’t know what they can or will do to those that refuse to comply.  I don’t like that I also have to sign a health contract, that there’s a snitch line for violators, that I need to get a pc test before I return to office, and by complying accept being randomly tested for covid.</p>
<p>Part of me wants to call project vertitas, and feels like I should have began recording everything, especially after they pushed CRT stuff hard.</p>
<p>We’re still 100% remote but even if you’re not returning to the office the vaccine mandate is for everyone.</p>
<p>I work for a very large institution with a lot of influence and power.  If they mandated this it makes me believe that they’ve analyzed this heavily and believe they have legal grounds to do it.</p>
<p>I’m so tired of all of this.  I’m trying to just put it out of my mind and go on with my life but it keeps coming back in my face.  Now everyone in NYC is like zomg Delta plus.</p>
<p>I live in a nice nyc suburb and love it here, but if we go towards another lockdown I’m gone.  I’m already looking for jobs in pro-liberty states and will make sure not to vote for what destroyed New York.</p>
<p>I expect that I’m either going to be forced to wear a mask in office despite being vaccinated, and that complying with a mandate and submitting my paperwork is consenting to endless boosters.</p>

        <p>I was skeptical right from the start but the wife had me doing all the dumb covid rituals because she was terrified of it. Luckily we're both lazy so the washing groceries didn't last long and she has had it at this point and no longer believes the hype. I was obviously cautious from the start but as I watched everything unravel I soon got to the point where I wasn't believing any of it anymore but I have had to going along with the restrictions as they are mandated in my area (SW Ontario), I definitely don't wear a mask outside and never have.</p>

        <p>In the very beginning I thought it would be just like every other nothingburger flu that the media scaremongers about. </p>
<p>I only got freaked out when things started shutting down. I stayed home, only went to work and didn’t hang out with anyone for about a month. I was one of the first people to start wearing a mask. But I never shamed anyone else for their choices.</p>
<p>It was actually all the shaming on social media that caused me to wake up, because I’ve always despised cancel culture and authoritarianism.</p>

        <p>Was kinda scared at first. Not so much for myself but for my grandparents and parents, especially with my mom working in a hospital. We quarantined for a while, but once the blm riots started happening and the msm said “covid doesn’t spread there” ……..that was when I woke up. That was too much BS. Then my mom told us the doctors weren’t allowed to ask patients who had covid if they’d been to a protest. 🙄 Give me a fucking break.</p>

        <p>I was afraid at first not going to lie. Seeing those videos of spring breakers partying together in mass gatherings made me say "how stupid of them!". However, after Surgeon General Jerome Adams made these warning comments:</p>
<p>“this is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly.”</p>
<p>“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized,” Adams said on “Fox News Sunday.” He added: “It’s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.”</p>
<p>+ all the BLM protests and seeing that cases/deaths didn't spike that's when I started seeing that this whole thing has been overblown and a scam.</p>

        <p>I was homeless and I was scared of water access being turned off more and more everyday in the first week. I was really sick at the time and I went nuts on home remedies like salt water and walked around in a tank top all day to get that sweet sunshine vitamin coz I didn't want any one to notice I was sick .... and I didn't want to get more sick than I was in case it was covid. I was more scared of someone finding out I was sick than out covid though. Everyone was acting crazy. I had to intervene when someone almost choked another passenger on a bus for sitting on the wrong seat. There was a fire... just a random fire on a median and NO ONE stopped to call 911.</p>

        <p>When it was only in China, I was worried it was a test of an ethnicity specific virus that would only infect Asians as a test of the technology before rolling out a supervirus that killed virtually all non ethnically Chinese people. After non-asians started getting it I was cautious with wearing a full face respirator until we saw the results here since I figured China's data meant exactly fucking nothing and it could be anything from less than the common cold to worse than the black plague. After seeing what it is, went back to living normally.</p>

        <p>I was concerned. I bought a bunch of back up non-perishable food just in case grocery store shelves got thin. I was big on hand sanitizer and wiping everything down. This last for about a week and then I saw that it was just a glorified cold/flu with 24/7 prime media sponsorship.</p>

        <p>At first, I thought this was it - the end of life as we knew it. That the virus was going to kill millions and millions of people and that the whole world would collapse. I was scared for my own life, despite being a healthy 17 year old. By the time April/May rolled around, I was skeptical and critical of lockdowns and other measures, and was no longer scared. I knew it was all a big overreaction. By August, I began to suspect that there was more going on than just incompetence and stupidity. By the end of the year, I was fully aware of the conspiracy side of things.</p>
