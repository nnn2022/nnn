    <strong>If there's one silver-lining to the lockdowns, it's made a lot of people realize how crazy and unhealthy we were living just because society said it was normal.</strong>
    <p><p>It's normal to eat junk food. It's normal to drink unfiltered tap water from plastic bottles. It's normal to take SSRIs. It's normal not to exercise. It's normal not to floss your teeth. It's normal to be overweight. It's normal to not take care of your skin. It's normal to be addicted to drugs/porn/video games/social media. It's normal to not be able to look at yourself naked without cringing. It's normal to breathe stale, recycled air. It's normal to never walk barefoot on the grass. Normal, normal, normal.</p>
<p>Not all of these are going to apply to everyone, but most of us are guilty of at least one.</p>
<p>Some people here just want everything to go back to the way it was, but if we want to get the chains of Big Government and Big Business off our necks for good, we can't just return to our complacent slumber. We need to be proactive and reject the unhealthy lifestyles foisted on us by people who do not have our best interests at heart just because they tell us it's normal.</p>
<p>I don't want a new normal and I don't want the old normal either. I want a New Abnormal where people stop trying to be normal and we start focusing on taking care of and accepting ourselves and each other.</p></p>

        <p>agree with everything you said, but for me personally i really struggle with SSRIs. i’ve been on them for over a decade, and every time i’ve weaned off them (6 times, most recently several months ago) i end up so suicidal i can’t function and am uncontrollably crying. it disturbs me that i can’t get more than 30 days of pills at a time and that if i was unable to get them, i’d be a mess. have done sooo many different behavioural forms of therapy, healthy lifestyle stuff, but these pills seem to the difference (at least for the time being still) between functioning depression and feeling the strong urge to end my life. it bums me out. </p>
<p>but yeah, normal no good.</p>

        <p>Definitely don't go off SSRIs if it makes you depressed or suicidal. I've used SSRIs in the past and they can be useful in some situations, but they're a bandaid at best and I don't think they're good for anyone long-term.</p>
<p>Have you considered experimenting with psychedelics? LSD is what got me to finally kick SSRIs for good. The positive mental health affects of occasion psychedelic use are well-documented. Even ketamine (which I've never done) is starting to be recognized to have therapeutic benefits in very low doses. Like anything though, moderation is key. High doses and frequent use can lead to bad outcomes.</p>
<p>I think that Eastern spirituality is also a lot more effective than most Western-based therapy techniques for dealing with the root causes of depression. Here's a good book to start with if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2UYch2JnO4</p>
