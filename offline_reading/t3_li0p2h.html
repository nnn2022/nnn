    <strong>Klaus Schwab isn't so bad</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously. I know he's been made into some Dr. Evil boogeyman and doomers will tell you his life's work is a 'conspiracy theory,' but if you actually read his book you'll find the man himself says many of the same things we do. Here's a quote from a chapter entitled "The risk of dystopia:"</p>
<p>&rt;Most people, fearful of the danger posed by COVID-19, will ask: Isnâ€™t it foolish not to leverage the power of technology to come to our rescue when we are victims of an outbreak and facing a life-or-death kind of situation? They will then be willing to give up a lot of privacy and will agree that in such circumstances public power can rightfully override individual rights. Then, when the crisis is over, some may realize that their country has suddenly been transformed into a place where they no longer wish to live.</p>
<p>And another:</p>
<p>&rt;However, at a global level, if viewed in terms of the percentage of the global population effected, the corona crisis is (so far) one of the least deadly pandemics the world has experience over the last 2000 years. In all likelihood, unless the pandemic evolves in an unforeseen way, the consequences of COVID-19 in terms of health and mortality will be mild compared to previous pandemics</p>
<p>I don't want to say he's an ally, as his Great Reset is ultimately a very risky suggestion in light of the sheer corruption and incompetence of global government (as he comes close to acknowledging). It would cause untold havoc, conflict, and distress. But he definitely isn't some Big Brother cult leader. He's opposed to a lot of the same things we are, including much of the 'new normal' - with its intense surveillance apparatus and unchecked state power. Give a man some credit.</p></p>

        <p>That's not in there either, funnily enough. I think our fascination with Schwab is allowing the people actually pushing that kind of bollocks to escape scrutiny.</p>

        <p>I havent done much personal research into Klaus Schwab. How much of this do you think is just PR stuff to sound reasonable to get people on-board with the "great reset"? Tyrants seldom announce that theyre here to take over the world and stomp on your face with a boot. It often happens incrementally with seemingly reasonable propositions over a long period of time.</p>

        <p>I haven't read the whole great reset but I did open the PDF and one of the chapters entitled moral choices or something or something moral caught my eye and I read it</p>
<p>One of the statements regarding masks is thisw</p>
<p>Great reset quote from chapter 3.1.2 moral choices</p>
<p>"Simply put, what we expose as facts or opinions are moral choices that the pandemic</p>
<p>has laid bare. They are made in the name of what we think is right or wrong and therefore define us as who</p>
<p>we are. Just one simple example to illustrate the point: the WHO and most national health authorities</p>
<p>recommend that we wear a mask in public. What has been framed as an epidemiological necessity and an</p>
<p>easy risk-mitigating measure has turned into a political battlefield. In the US and, also, but less so, in a few</p>
<p>other countries, the decision to wear a mask or not has become politically charged since it is considered</p>
<p>as an infringement to personal freedom. But behind the political declaration, refusing to wear a mask in</p>
<p>public is a moral choice, as indeed is the decision to wear one. Does this tell us something about the moral</p>
<p>principles that underpin our choices and decisions? Probably yes" -3.1.2 moral choices</p>
<p><a href="http://reparti.free.fr/schwab2020.pdf">http://reparti.free.fr/schwab2020.pdf</a></p>
<p>I agree with him and disagree with him here I disagree with him in the insinuation that not wearing a mask is implying that you are less moral than someone I think a lot of times a person choosing to not wear a mask is them showing their moral objection against these lockdowns in such, Hence the line "Simply put, what we expose as facts or opinions are moral choices that the pandemic has laid bare."</p>
<p>However, I agree with him when he states it is " framed as an epidemiological necessity</p>
<p>He simply stated it was being framed like this this reminds me of another quote from the book where he states that this pandemic is far less deadly than others we have faced and is a great opportunity for change, however when he's on the Tv he does not say that...</p>
<p>I think anyone that writes a book like this about changing the world in their vision etc it definitely  a bit nuts but hey i have not read it i will print it out and bind it with cardboard and zip ties and read it while I read other books</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One last thing is I remember seeing ac lip in 2020 of him saying 75 years ago great people got together to.... What is referencing I thought it was the first Bilderberg meeting but I'm off by about 9 years</p>
