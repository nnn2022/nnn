    <strong>Is it just me or are those who truly care about being healthy more likely to not take the jab?</strong>
    <p><p>I just found it pretty interesting that I'm the only one in my family, extended family, and group of friends that didn't get the jab. I am also the only one who takes extremely good care of my body and mental health. It's also super interesting that once I started making an effort to be healthy over the past year, many of my perspectives on life changed to that of a "conspiracy theorist"</p>
<p>I think the reason might be the fact that society today sees solutions through a narrow pipe, unable to see all of the alternative and less-risky solutions. I've noticed that the people getting the jab are those who also eat fast food, live sedentary lives, and have the mindset of going to a medical doctor for any physical/mental problems for a prescription instead of looking for a more natural remedy. Am i tripping or have you guys been noticing this too?</p></p>

        <p>It just takes one crack in the dam, and time. </p>
<p>I’m a bit of a researcher, so it started with me when I was able to diagnose minor medical issues better than my own doctors and “specialists”. I then saw friends of mine completely ruin their lives by taking medications, especially benzos and antidepressants. I noticed that most of these strange people in society, like these Antifa kids, are all heavily medicated. </p>
<p>I noticed little things like how using a physical aloe plant on a sunburn is literally 100x more effective than absolutely anything you can buy in a drug store. I noticed how friends who had developed sleeping pill dependency could cure themselves with CBD. I noticed how many skin conditions can be cured with just sunlight, most digestive issues can be fixed with a change in diet, and everything is helped by exercise, especially “depression”. </p>
<p>The final conclusion: the medical industry is incompetent and corrupt. It’s somewhat of a trope that they only care about profits, but it’s true and people need to behave accordingly. You can’t “tRuSt ThE eXPeRtS” when the expert’s main motivation is removing dollars from your wallet. And that is true whether you have government healthcare or private healthcare.</p>

        <p>Amazing comment, and I’ve noticed the same. It wasn’t until Rockefeller’s push to petroleum based medicines that all the “earthy” cures were abandoned over 100 years ago</p>

        <p>Yep, and now those cures are demonized as "quackery" even though they've been effective for thousands of years. Here in Korea, herbs, diet, and acupuncture are used quite successfully for "unexplained" conditions like infertility and hair loss, while allopathic medicine has nothing to offer but expensive medications with a host of dangerous side effects.</p>

        <p>I’ve healed my eyesight from -4.5 aperture to currently -2.5 in 3-4 years, by just getting several glasses in increments of 0.25 aperture. </p>
<p>The American optometrist association actually tried to pass a law a couple years ago that would’ve made it so that consumers can no longer view their own aperture.  </p>

        <p>A lot of people regret it. Some people even kill themselves.</p>
<p>Why slice my eye and put in a lense and do all this crazy shit on one of the most sensitive body parts- when I can just wear gradually weaker glasses and go look long distances(golf course, field, city balcony) for the same result?</p>

        <p>I used to have heavy allergies as a kid. Used to have asthma. I was told by the pharma industry that "tough luck, can't do shit, take these drugs for the rest of your life :)"</p>
<p>My asthma is basically nonexistant. It gradually got better along the years but the final nail in the coffin was acupuncture. Believe me I was skeptical myself but if it fucking works it fucking works. Used to be allergic to a whole bunch of foods. Now I just am not. Got my body used to them by slowly getting exposure in small amounts and getting in good shape and living a healthy lifestyle. I only get seasonal allergies a couple of weeks a year, then I take some nettle extract and the symptoms just go away.</p>
<p>They are not healers. They are businessmen - or I should say conmen. And their business model is keeping people sick and addicted to their bullshit drugs. And boy oh boy do they hate competition. Especially if the competition is just growing freely in nature or is in fact, inside your very own body.</p>

        <p>Well, I'm not an expert by any means. I just know my own experience. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, you could at least try it. My asthma was very severe as a child, then I gradually grew out of it. They may not disappear completely, but there might be a chance of lessening the symptoms. Personally, I keep an inhaler with me but I rarely need to use it, only in very specific situations when I'm exposed to an allergen that I know affects me.</p>
<p>We human beings are extremely complex beings. I think modern science is just scratching the very tip of the iceberg on what makes us sick and what keeps us healthy. I look at health in much more of a holistic way, stress for example is a major contributor in all kinds of ailments. I think the most important thing is to live a healthy lifestyle in general. Good food, exercise, limiting stress are the things I would start with.</p>

        <p>That's cool. Cayenne is cheaper and more convenient. I recommend Bragg in the glass bottles for drinking ACV. They make them so the sourness isn't as harsh. I tried vinegar and water, and the taste gets pretty awful.</p>

        <p>I've noticed the same thing with skin issues.  People have been asking me for years about my perfect skin; I've had professional makeup artists on film sets mention it.  My secret is literally following my grandma's advice: never use soap, only water to wash your face.  Don't wash every day in the winter; that dries out your skin.  Makeup is only for stage, sets, and evening affairs.  Get outside every day, but don't burn yourself.  Don't smoke.  Eat a variety of vegetables; God made it easy to cook nutritious food-- just use lots of different colored vegetables together and you'll get all the nutrients.  I was playing a 15-year-old on TV when I was 28 this approach works so well.  </p>
<p>I've also noticed things like the way massage works better than pain pills to recover from being hit by a car.  These things are pretty damn important.</p>

        <p>Yeah I do think genetics plays a big part. By far the biggest part, actually. </p>
<p>I spent three years taking ecstasy and speed every single weekend 20 years ago. I have smoked for 25 years. I have a couple of whiskeys every night. And my diet has not been good in the past. It's only recently improved. </p>
<p>Yet I'm mid 40s and look 15 years younger than most in the mid 40s. The guy I sit next to at work is 54. He eats only good things, doesn't drink, doesn't smoke and rides to and from work on a bicycle every day. And he looks 60.</p>
<p>But my body on the inside most likely looks like a horror show compared to his. So genes might sort out the outside, but the inside is far more important.</p>

        <p>I like to research, too and 15+ years ago when I was thinking of starting a family,  I realized I really needed to think about what I put in my body a bit more serioiusly and started doing some research.</p>
<p>I am so thankful that my mom always cooked from scratch so it was easy for me to continue doing that. So many people are seemingly unwilling to follow a recipe and cook something half way decent. McD's, pizza, etc. is just too alluring. Those same people are sadly not seeing the irony with the donut for a jab incentives out there.  </p>
<p>As they say,  there is no flu season, there is only a low vitamin D season. I have taken that to heart for probably 20 years now and don't even get colds - even when my kids are sick as dogs and I'm the only one taking care of them.</p>

        <p>Actually the fruit diet probably did kill him as pancreatic cancer has roots in insulin sensitivity. That’s why this particular cancer is on the rise in Japan as their modern diets are heavy on the high glycemic index foods with less and less protein/fiber.</p>

        <p>This ticks me off so much.  My brother and my dad both are on blood pressure meds for life (my bro is only 36yo).  I asked both of them if they had thought about, I dunno, changing their diet and exercising?  Neither of them wanted to put in the effort.</p>
<p>When my doctor told me my blood pressure was a tad high, I immediately started dieting and getting my weight back to mid-normal BMI.  Who the hell wants to be on something when they can avoid it?  My dad has to stick a needle in his stomach twice a day for diabetes that he could have completely avoided with diet/exercise.</p>
<p>The funny thing is my dad and me are on the same page about the covid vax and most other things - my brother on the other hand is a far left doomer.  Goes to show laziness is on both sides of the table I guess.</p>

        <p>I exercise a lot now. I noticed that there is a mild improvement in your mentality based on the reality that you are physically better. It's like if you were taking a Mustang to a drag race rather than an old Corolla, you'd certainly feel better about the Mustang. However, there is a huge improvement in your mind and mood that is based in just being healthy and happy rather than a superficial thing.</p>

<p>There's definitely a place for modern western medicine, but you must understand that there is a profit incentive behind it as well. </p>
<p>The food pyramid? Lies, all of it. It was based on whichever industry paid the most to be featured on the bottom of the pyramid. I myself cut out gluten and saw my unmanageable ulcerative colitis symptoms DISAPPEAR after the "science" said that diet does not affect this condition.

        <p>One size fits all! Because we worship double blind controlled trials, as if people don't have differences in constitution. So any medicine produced needs to be powerful enough to bang out the same effect in everyone regardless of their physical differences. (Not that medicines are even tested properly on women.)</p>
<p>And medicines only focus on the symptoms, not the root cause. Hair falling out? Let's force more hair to grow instead of fixing the underlying imbalance! Can't get pregnant?

        <p>It's disease management, not medicine. Medicine cures people. The purpose of our healthcare systems is to maintain a manageable level of disease that justifies ever-increasing budgets, but without a workforce too sick to work. Best example of this is diabetes-causing foods being the norm in hospitals, and part of government food guidelines, while diabetics are managed with lifetime insulin shots. All instead of simply reversing T2D with low/zero carb diet. Because removing carbs from the diet cuts the vultures (big food and big pharma) off from profiting from that individual. Our healthcare system is really extension of big food and big pharma.</p>

        <p>There's also this exaltation of doctors without understanding how they think. "I'm not a doctor." You hear people say that as an excuse, and of course they don't have any idea how doctors are stuck in a box and refuse to think outside of it.</p>
<p>People with high conscientiousness and high intelligence are the most likely to go through high levels of schooling. They have the intelligence and the discipline to study all the crap doctors are forced to study like memorizing every crook and crevice on every bone in the human body (stuff I'm sure they forget most of). The bad thing is that this high level of conscientiousness makes them linear and orthodox thinkers, and obviously, they've embraced the orthodoxy of big pharma's established paradigm.</p>

        <p>Yep I completely agree. Appealing to authority is a bad argument, and appealing to the authority of other's is even worse. I'm an engineer, and I would never pretend to know more about the engines I help design than the mechanics who are hands on with those engines every day for decades.</p>

        <p>Doctors do not study with as much depth as you believe. It is a well known institutional fact that doctors and nurses learn anatomy and physiology by outlines. Something Biologists don't have the luxury of. It is specifically because the Physician no longer exists. Every doctor, save for some General Internists who are on Accelerated Tracks because they're going to be the only doctor in an underserved rural, and isolated area (and this is part of the deal for mostly free medical school) are remotely close to the Physician AND they aren't allowed to also major in pediatrics. They have to choose between that and general internal medicine.</p>

        <p>That's interesting. My cousin is an Internist and a Pediatrician in a underserved rural area in Tennessee. Now it makes sense why he's staying in the boondocks ... mostly free medical school. Good deal.</p>

        <p>And freedom to be good at being a doctor. Also, if he indeed managed to get both in school, he's likely someone who should be a doctor. They are REALLY opposed to letting you master more than one specialty. Though, there are issues in East Tennessee so they might have allowed him to do it so that they could get someone out there and stay out there.</p>

        <p>You are called a conspiracy theorist because the MSM and Big Pharma do not want honesty and truth to be mainstream anymore. By excommunicating your opinion, they have effectively put you in a corner and prohibited any reasoning/debate, because in their minds, they are right and you are wrong. However, you will have the last laugh. This gene therapy is destructive and will have serious medical implications in the future. </p>
<p>COVID-19 was so "bad", and I use that term extremely likely given the overall mortality rate amongst the vast majority of people, for those people that are now getting the vaccine: overweight, unhealthy people. It is because they are incredibly lazy and don't want to put in the effort to get their life back on track so they aren't at risk for COVID. In the United States particularly, you see that people would rather pop a pill than get off their couch and fix their life. Most of Americans eat horrendously: high fat, high sugar and processed foods/meats that are pumped with hormones, pesticides, etc. Rather than changing their diet, they look to the All-Mighty Big Pharma to create a drug to help maintain their lifestyle, i.e blood pressure meds, type 2 diabetes treatment, etc. I speak with obese and overweight people on the daily due to my job, and you would be shocked to hear how many of them are suffering so much, <strong>solely due to their weight</strong>. Food is medicine, but because of greed, the MSM and western medicine (not all doctors, but a lot) want you to believe that there are no alternatives. There was a weight loss pill that was just approved by the FDA (but I mean, are we really surprised? That organization is so watered down it is a complete joke), which illustrates my point. When you present an overweight/morbidly obese person with changing their entire lifestyle, which takes commitment and self reflection, or popping a pill, I am almost sure that they will choose the latter. </p>
<p>This is the dilemma that unhealthy people face today: they were told for months that their risk of dying from COVID is extremely high and they are presented with a "vaccine" that is supposedly supposed to be a cure-all for the virus. So of course they are going to sign up. But even with healthy people, I know several very fit and health-conscious people become chronically ill from the jab. It is a slippery slope.</p>

        <p>Actually saturated &amp; animal fats, especially from butter &amp; red meat, are the ultimate super foods. Why do you think they’re pushing veganism so hard?</p>
<p>It’s processed seed/most plant oils &amp; GMO/monocrop grains &amp; legumes, along with refined sugars of course, that contribute to  those diseases, along with plastic/petroleum derived toxins.</p>

        <p>I am not a medical professional and am merely an observer of American culture/diet habits. You are missing my point entirely. Can you provide a source supporting the assertion that butter and red meat are healthy to consume regularly? These products are only beneficial if you are consuming organic, grass fed beef/animal products. These foods are too expensive for the vast majority of Americans. I was referring to the overall health of Americans, which is generally poor, that is negatively affected by an unhealthy diet, comprised of these foods. I did mention high sugar, i.e processes sugars. Additionally, the frequency and quantity with which they consume these products is alarming. Your comment is contradictory because veganism by its very nature avoids/reduces saturated/trans fats, notably butter, pig lard and red meat. I don't know if you are being satirical or not. No processed food is good for you, period.</p>

        <p>It's the opposite. Seed oils, or polyunsaturated fats are what's making everyone obese. 
Saturated fat, like coconut oil, is actually good for you. Look into Ray Peat, he has many articles written on this.</p>

        <p>I was an RN for 15 years, I had a wonderful job for a Silicon Valley company but as soon as the government decided to use the medical profession to usher in a totalitarian agenda I became a whistleblower, I accidentally discovered classified information that implicated the US military in the spread of COVID. I lost my license for this so I know I am correct. </p>
<p>Kinda convenient a virus that is deadlier to Chinese pops up in a city of 19 million in a heavily populated economic zone of China during a trade war. It's also convenient it popped up just in time for Chinese new year, when many people would be congregating and traveling. I might also mention 2 other pandemics that destroyed China's pork and poultry industry, necessitating them to import poultry/pork from the US. It seems mother nature smiles upon the US so often....</p>

<p>They've really done a number on young people who swear by the vaccine as if in some kind of cult. </p>

        <p>Its an interesting hypothesis. I personally am not as healthy as I would like to be but I do eat well, exercise and spend plenty of time in motion. But a few LBS could drop. I am not doing it cause its being pushed in a very ominous way as well as its totally unnecessary like the flu shot.</p>

        <p>Eating well, exercising, and spending time in motion is more than can be said for a lot of people. And the fact that you acknowledge you could do better and WANT to be healthier? Instead of spouting "hEaLtH aT aNy SiZe" nonsense? Your mindset is light years ahead of the general population...</p>

        <p>Thanks, and I agree, the "healthy at any size" crowd is more woke-ism and doctors should not be supporting it, I don't think fat people necessary need to be shamed outright but definitely not be lauded as they have been in the last few years. Nicole Arbour is on point with her fat people video. Many unhealthy people and habits are part of the reason healthcare costs are so high in this country.</p>

        <p>Yep. I don't think it's right to mock or belittle overweight people, but scientific facts should be stated truthfully instead of the truth being distorted to make people feel better. And you make a good point about healthcare costs. Everyone ends up paying more when a large percentage of the population is overweight.</p>

        <p>Definetly intereting because for me its like the opposite. I am very healthy, at least, I feel very healthy. Got maybe a minor cold once in 2 years. I do have a physical job what keeps me in motion but thats it. Rest of the time I'm attached to couch or pc chair. I don't do sports and hate excersize. I order food almost everyday, it's not like mcDonalds crap but still not the healthiest food. Like pizza or chinese or a beef menu. The most healthy thing I eat is a half apple at work a few days in the week. Despite all of this I'm considered slim by most people. Around 5.5 ft and 124 LBS. I do have a little belly fat but its normal natural female belly fat which wouldn't be there if I would train once a week. If I go to work on my bycicle I lose weight very quickly and then my butt is hurting when I sit on hard surface because I sit more on my bones instead of fat. So my intake is considered not healthy at all, still I feel healthy (allthough my foodhabits may cause harm later, i'm in mid 30's now). 
The reason I don't want the vaccine is similair to yours. The propaganda around the virus and the vaccine is almost hilarious. I'm not an antivaxxer in general, I even believe maybe healthcare does good things sometimes. But this whole circus is so sketchy from the first day and it is so obvious whats going on. There are a couple of cheap, patent free medicin which do their work just fine but doctors who use this got demonized. In their own report, Moderna tells litterally it is in a test fase, we don't know what this new semi genetically therapy will do in humans because we haven't test it so far. </p>
<p>It already sucks we are milkcows since it is payed with our tax money, but Im not a lab rat so they need to force it in me!</p>

        <p>They are starting to vaccinate &rt;12 in my country now. One of the arguments from the lead pediatrician was that "they now don't have to test before going to events, something they would like to not have to do anymore just like the &rt;18 group". </p>
<p>How evil can you be to pretend that is a good reason to vaccinate a group that has zero issues with this virus? Because then they are (temporarily) less effected by some artificial measures that should not have been there in the first place? Pure evil</p>

<p>She likes spreading fear about covid. Complains about the smallest things (I took shotgun, she said it was fine, but still made the ride a living hell because she wasn't satisfied sitting in the back, refused offers to swap places)</p>
<p>She eats junk food more than normal food</p>
<p>Consumes alcohol every 2nd day </p>
<p>Sweets? A lot. </p>
<p>Control freak? Yes sir.</p>
<p>She can be a good person but her addictions and vices are too much for her which makes her quite unbearable most of the time. So yeah, I can see the link between you are experiencing and what I am noticing as well. People who generally are douchy, unhealthy, loud and so-on seem to go for the jab without questions. Its a terrible shame whats to come to those. But in the end, its their choice, not mine.</p>

        <p>Overconsumption of PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), through mainly seed oils, causes obesity, and I suspect, reduced brain function. Or perhaps people not getting enough cholesterol and sugar (these are good for you, our brains are made of cholesterol and run on glucose).</p>

        <p>I am disabled but I have to do a lot to remain alive....like eat a lot of vegetarian food [eat some meat because I am anemic, but I have it reduced massively, eat healthy food, avoid processed foods because they make me sick. I was having severe bowel problems but when I made sure to cut GMO food out of the diet, I got control of those.  I am someone who looks for anti-GMO label on food and while I am too poor to make this complete, I buy as much organic food as possible. I am on a lot of medication but have rejected some as harmful. I hang out in health food stores and holistic places too, for years. </p>
<p>I don't eat fast food, it makes me sick too. I am not going to line up for some poison not thinking about it.</p>

        <p>I have some ideas. Look for local farmers in your area that sell grass finished meat and pasture raised poultry. It can't get any healthier than that. Make sure they don't use any gmo feeds for their poultry, do rotational grazing so they don't have to use something shit like fertilizer on the pastures and you should be good to go. Also, if your body allows it, try to grow your own food. You can save a shit ton of money doing that.</p>

        <p>I live in apt, but did get some gardening space off site. I wish I did have my own land but around here that's expensive. I definitely am going to look for some local farms to get meat, I do buy vegetables from a farmer 6 months out of the year. I ate lettuce I grew this week.</p>

        <p>From what I can tell, those who want to pop a pill or use an ab stimulation machine while they sit and watch wheel of fortune are those who are more likely to take it. Those who watch their diet, exercise, <em>avoid</em> adding unnecessary things to their body, and believe in supporting one's own immune system and gastronomic biome, are less interested in getting the jab.  It comes down to effort.  Quick fixes versus time and effort is all IMO.</p>

        <p>This whole pandemic literally whipped me into shape. I have a pretty big shed out the back of my house and it was full of gym stuff I’ve accumulated over the years but never bothered to use (Pull Up Bar, Mounted Dip Bars, Squat Rack, Bench, Barbells &amp; Weights). Seeing that covid didn’t effect the healthy i decided to work out during lockdown. I’ve went from 60KG to 71KG in nearly a year, made some significant gains along with a bit of fat (which is to be expected for bulking) and I can say I’ve never felt better. People complimenting me how I look has boosted my confidence more than ever and done a great deal for my mental health. Been taking my vitamins D, Zinc, B12, Magnesium &amp; Quercetin which is supposed to be good for your body if you end up catching covid. 
The whole pandemic has me actually looking after my body and my mind a lot more and to save that I will not be getting vaccine.</p>

<p>Although, I believe people may not seek or are aware of more natural alternatives to health issues. It’s a matter of how the individual wants to manage their health. If they want to trust their health practitioner completely, then fine. Or if they want to get multiple opinions and do their own research, then that’s fine too. Now more than ever, I personally do my research for natural alternatives before I go to a GP, and weigh both options.</p>

        <p>It’s because you took personal responsibility for your health. They want it to be somebody else’s. As a result, they need the vaccine to work. You know you have other options.</p>

        <p>You’re not tripping! You’re absolutely correct. I too noticed everything you mentioned. Pretty much everyone in my family decided to get the lethal Covid injections, even though I insisted that they don’t, or at least wait for it to be FDA approved.</p>
<p>Well, many of them are really regretting they got it now. They all have horrible side effects. One of my uncles died right after his second injection. My grandfather passed a week after his second injection (he was in his 90s, but I think he’d still be here if not for this poison) and here I am, healthier than I’ve ever been in my life — jab free of course. I’ll never get injected. I made a promise to myself I wouldn’t.</p>
<p>It’s everyone else who’s crazy! Not us.</p>

        <p>They are too lazy or lack the self-respect to keep themselves fit, so it makes sense they're looking for the magic pills on health. They don't trust their own body and why would they, since they treat it like shit. I wouldn't trust a rusty ass machine that has been beat to hell and never been properly taken care of either. The insecurity is radiating off of them. That's why they get so fucking triggered when not everyone is taking that shitty ass vaccine.</p>
<p>People who know that maintaining good health requires dedication and effort, won't give two shits about the vaccine. I trust my body, I trust my immune system. When I die, I die. I don't worry about it. I have made my peace with my inevitable death, I've got nothing to fear.</p>
<p>I see people smoking a cigarette with a mask hanging off their neck. Buying processed food, sugar, wheat, alcohol, all that bullshit while wearing a mask at the grocery store. Meanwhile, I buy meat and butter, veggies fruits and berries. It's like bro are you even trying? Haven't worn that nasty ass rag once. I've gotten sick a grand total of one time since march 2020 and that's because our child got some nasty bug at the daycare. I was over it in a couple of days. Sucked, but hey, that's life.</p>

        <p>Sure. I already have a natural aversion to 'medicine' which for the most part are scary pills.</p>
<p>I rarely even take Advil or Tylenol, and if extreme need (like a pulled muscle) even then sparingly.</p>
<p>I don't believe in 'covering stuff up' that hurts or otherwise.. I'm at my dentist and she's recommending 'sensitive teeth' toothpaste and I'm like 'But I don't have sensitive teeth, as far as I know, so why is the same spot bothering me then?"</p>

        <p>The same thing can be done to improve the immune system using any combo of eating healthy, exercising in moderation, being active, getting vitamin D from the sun, don’t smoke or drink in excess, I consider the risk from the vaccine more than the risk of catching covid for healthy people and the immune system being able to deal with it. We’ve had a whole year to promote healthy lifestyle. </p>
<p>It’s my opinion that anyone getting the covid vaccine is only bringing their immune system in line with an average healthy person, it’s a quick fix to get back out for deck beers and cheeseburgers.</p>

        <p>Omg, yes.</p>
<p>From my experience, most of the people who jumped at the new vaccines, when you ask them "are you worried about the side effects?" Respond with "Meh" or seem like they don't care about what happens to them. In contrast with people who do NOT want the vaccine; most say "I'm worried about adverse health effects."</p>

        <p>in taking responsibility for your health, you naturally hold it at a higher value. Why would any person who invests time and effort in their health get a jab that has shown to make healthy people sick? If my immune system can’t stand up to the virus, fine.

        <p>Someone on r/news tried to tell me that I was believing in a Trump-era right wing conspiracy not to take the vax, and then linked to a news article saying the same. But literally all the trumpers I know have taken it. They firmly believed in Operation Warp Speed and feel that the vaccine is a Trump success…</p>
<p>However all the nutritionists and health nuts I know are vocally against it… and my yogi are all very much against it. </p>

        <p>I don't care that much or worry about health 24/7, but the way the "vaccine" works is too random and it's more likely to cause more harm than getting exposed to a small amount of viral particles. Especially since I have a 99.8% chance of survival (and that is only counting the cases that sought out some medical attention). Plus I've had the thing during the initial outbreak, worst thing was 1 day of sore muscles like from a flu. Took traditional flu medicine and it cleared out in 3 days. </p>
<p>The way I see it taking this type of experimental therapy if you aren't at risk is like betting 10k on a football match and if you win you get an extra 0.02%.</p>

        <p>&rt;there are definitely alternatives to chemotherapy such as fasting (fasting isn't a one size fits all situation though).</p>
<p>This shit sounds so out of touch with reality and kind of condescending. If fasting was a legit alternative to chemo no one would be going through chemo. </p>
<p>There are a lot of bullshit "home remedies" out there. While I agree that there are some ailments that can be treated naturally or at least help with symptoms. There a lot more that need legit medical intervention, and there's nothing wrong with that. It shouldn't be the last resort for everything, it depends on the situation. I have known people who died because they viewed it as a "last resort" but it turns out it was their only chance at survival but they didn't see it that way at the time. Both didn't want to die, it was preventable. Both regretted not seeking legit medical help.</p>
<p>Sniffing/drinking essential oils is not going to cure anyone. That shit is a scam, just throwing it out there.</p>

        <p>A study by researchers from the University of Texas together with Pfizer and BioNtech and published this month by Nature journal found that antibodies elicited by the vaccine were still able to neutralize all tested variants, including Delta, albeit at reduced strength.</p>

        <p>I don't know more about vaccines than those who made them. What I do know is that I'm not getting the covid vaccine...lol. mRNA research has been going on for a while, but it's interesting to see that those developing those vaccines have never succeeded. It took a pandemic and censoring of real treatments such as Ivermectin in order to get them approved under EUA. mRNA vaccines have never made it to phase 3 of clinical trials prior to these covid vaccines, so that alone is pretty sketchy. In addition, all 3 major covid vaccine manufacturers (pfizer, moderna, j&amp;j) all have sketchy histories and I am not comfortable getting a vaccine from people who have done sketchy things.</p>
<p>You must be going through a lot. To go on a subreddit and berate others for choosing what they put in their bodies is sad. I hope whatever's happening in your life gets better. </p>
<p>Look man, I look after myself and will never put some weird ass shit in my body. Am I perfect? No. I still eat non-organic fruits and vegs, fluoridated water, etc. but I am getting closer and closer to being where I want to be. </p>
<p>If we were all vaccinated, the delta variant, delta plus variant, and other variants will still be roaming around. If you haven't realized it yet, the vaccines were never meant to stop the pandemic, hence the CDC recommending vaccinated individuals to continue to wear masks. Covid will be around regardless of whether we all get vaccinated or not, because it will continue to mutate. Learn to live with it and protect yourself by being healthy. Hope all is well :D</p>
