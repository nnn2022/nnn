    <strong>Is it my severe depression spiraling or is this happening to everyone?</strong>
    <p><p>I was on my state's subreddit and they posted new data on the covid numbers.  I responded to the post mentioning how I do not understand how people believe all this.  Why aren't people wearing hazmat suits if it were so deadly?  Why aren't we focusing on all diseases that cause high death rates? Why are medicines so expensive? Why do cigarettes and alcohol get sold if they ruin the lives of people that use or drive under the influence and kill innocent people?  I was permanently banned from my state's subreddit with no explanation of "covid".  I questioned it and was told the vaccine is safe and I'm the one spreading propaganda and need to stop.  What happened to freedom of speech?  Why can't we respond to things anymore or have a valid discussion about something?  Why does one group get to decide what is considered safe/science?  I feel incredibly sick inside. Powerless. Misunderstood.  Lost in a sinful world.  Even my own spouse took the vaccine and doesn't understand or want to listen to anything other than the narrative.  I'm starting to question my own sanity.  I do suffer from depression and a mood disorder so maybe I'm off my rocker?  God help us all.  I am starting to wonder if it is in my own best interest to just log off the Internet entirely.  Oh yeah, I also got an update from the school about following mandates and how they are strongly recommending students 12 and older to get vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>The thing that bugs me is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why didnt they push vit D, zinc, and exercise, and explicitly tell people to loose wright because the obese are at risk?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why didnt we do mass testing for influenza and TB at the same time (we could have potentially eliminated TB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is it decriminalized to now pass on HIV in california</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why didnt we do mass std, hepatitis testing during the pandemic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why couldnt we have subsidized insulin at least a little bit with some of the trillion $ bailout $?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is depressing.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  Now, where do you go on the Internet that is safe?  Do we just have to suck this shit up and deal with it?  Maybe I need to pull out my bible now too.</p>

        <p>I could’ve written what you just did, I have had many times I felt exactly the same. Like it’s all too much. It’s so much bigger than us it’s sucking us in like a giant title wave and we can’t even fight against it. The world is circling the drain and all the kicking and screaming isn’t going to get us out of this. But there’s something inside of me, I don’t even know what it is, and it wants to fight. That part of me knows that my gut is on to something. I’ve never felt like this about anything in my entire life and I am not a young person. I’ve never been one to listen to alternate viewpoints that were vastly different from my own but once I started doing that I realized nothing was what I thought it was. The last couple of years have been a huge awakening for me. It actually started for me probably about four years ago, I started realizing all the lies and all the manipulation. Then when this hit I had already gotten used to being able to discern manipulation and propaganda.</p>
<p>When you feel overwhelmed step away from it for a while and just don’t read news or think about it. It will be there when you go back to it. It’s incredibly difficult being around people who are not aware of what’s going on and they view you as some sort of crazy person. Find like-minded people for a support system. Do not give into the gaslightingYou know what it is. I think most of us here have probably followed similar journeys. Do you really think millions and millions of people are all wrong? Are all paranoid and suspicious and conspiracy theorist? No they are not.</p>
<p>I do feel like we are living in a lawless World right now just like you, and at this point I feel like I can’t even speak or text openly on my own phone. Just know this, you are not alone, there are millions that feel like you. But the powers that be don’t want you to know that, they want you to feel alone and crazy. Why else would they be doing everything possible to censor us and prevent us from speaking to one another? In your gut you know what this is, you’re being tested on a daily basis and I understand that there are times when it’s all just a little too much.  </p>
<p>I just watched this and I thought it was amazing, I felt understood watching it</p>

        <p>I had that old familiar dark sinking sadness feeling crash into my brain after several months of dramatically improved mood. I moved to the south right after Christmas. Things are still normal here but it feels so tenuous. I feel scared and upset.</p>
<p>I think getting off the internet would help. Maybe checking news once a week. But it’s hard. Luckily I’m off social media and never going back. But still.</p>

        <p>I wonder how many others are experiencing these same feelings. I got off Facebook back when covid first started because it was too upsetting to me. I do enjoy my algorithm on Tik Tok because it gives me some hope but then there are days like today where I question reality altogether. Maybe it's all an illusion. I think I need to schedule a counseling session but then I'll have anxiety until it happens. Ugh.</p>
