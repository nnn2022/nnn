        <p><em>Politruk</em>, the Soviets called them.  A guy embedded with a unit to make sure everybody was having pure thoughts about the government.</p>
<p>I don't think the Nazis had anything like this, their...enthusiasm...didn't need to be enforced.</p>

        <p>It was part of the SS's job to make sure people aligned with party doctrine. I don't think they had an official role but they had SS agents within units that didn't publicly identify as SS.</p>

<p>Civilians, sure, through the <em>SD</em> and the <em>Gestapo</em>.  I've never seen anything to indicate that this was practiced in the German military, though.  Might have been, for all I know; Hitler loved his spies.  The true history of what happened will probably never be known.  The post-WW2 propaganda machine could have given Dr. Fauci some lessons.</p>

        <p>Propaganda is more my thing and what made me swallow the purple pill. It's been a side hobby for a quarter century studying everything from Rome through the Soviet Union and CIA disinformation during the cold war. I'd been concerned about the media conglomeration since a few years before WMDs in 02/03. During the 2016 election I went from concern to outright alarm watching the switch get flipped to full power. </p>
<p>Fauci is undoubtedly taking his ques from somewhere but he's not a propagandist. Whoever is behind it though makes me feel like a rank amateur trying to decipher the techniques being used.</p>

<p>You're right, he's a classic mouthpiece; he's not inventing the propaganda, but he's more than willing to spread it.</p>
<p>To make him even more dangerous, he actually <em>believes</em> the horseshit he's shoveling.  A zealot's zealot.</p>

        <p>I don't think he believes it, I think he's getting rich off of disseminating it though. I'll tell you though that the people behind the politicization of Covid which are effectively the Pharma companies are evil. The way they've manipulated the media for over a quarter century to keep cigarettes unnecessarily addictive in order to protect usage of the leading vector of disease globally is disturbing. They're knowingly killing six million people per year to protect their profit margins. The mechanisms they've put into place to do it is pretty damn effective.</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure he does.  Fervently.  I mean, I guess he could just be doing it for pay, but I don't get that impression at all. When I look at him I see a fanatic.  I watched him do this exact same thing with AIDS back in the 80s.  He was a nutcase back then and I'm sad to see him back in the disease limelight again.</p>
