        <p>These mods are probably hoping to get us riled up and vocal causing reddit to have to make a decision to side with us or against us. Any guesses which way they'd go?</p>
<p>The problem is most of us really don't care. r/iamatotalpieceofshit being sanctimonious? That's just funny.</p>

<p>Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities</p>
<p>Effective April 17, 2017.</p>
<p>Engage in Good Faith</p>
<p>Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for their co-collaborators. It’s not appropriate to attack your own users. Communities are active, in relation to their size and purpose, and where they are not, they are open to ideas and leadership that may make them more active.</p>
<p>Management of your own Community</p>
<p>Moderators are important to the Reddit ecosystem. In order to have some consistency:</p>
<p>Community Descriptions:</p>
<p>Please describe what your community is, so that all users can find what they are looking for on the site.</p>
<p>Clear, Concise, and Consistent Guidelines:</p>
<p>Healthy communities have agreed upon clear, concise, and consistent guidelines for participation. These guidelines are flexible enough to allow for some deviation and are updated when needed. <strong>Secret Guidelines aren’t fair to your users—transparency is important to the platform</strong>.</p>
<p>Stable and Active Teams of Moderators:</p>
<p>Healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.</p>
<p>Association to a Brand:</p>
<p>We love that so many of you want to talk about brands and provide a forum for discussion. Remember to always flag your community as “unofficial” and be clear in your community description that you don’t actually represent that brand.</p>
<p>Use of Email:</p>
<p>Please provide an email address for us to contact you. While not always needed, certain security tools may require use of email address so that we can contact you and verify who you are as a moderator of your community.</p>
<p>Appeals:</p>
<p><strong>Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment</strong></p>
<p>Remember the Content Policy</p>
<p>You are obligated to comply with our Content Policy.</p>
<p>Management of Multiple Communities</p>
<p><strong>We know management of multiple communities can be difficult, but we expect you to manage communities as isolated communities and not use a breach of one set of community rules to ban a user from another community</strong>. In addition, camping or sitting on communities for long periods of time for the sake of holding onto them is prohibited.</p>
<p>Respect the Platform</p>
<p>Reddit may, at its discretion, intervene to take control of a community when it believes it in the best interest of the community or the website. This should happen rarely (e.g., a top moderator abandons a thriving community), but when it does, our goal is to keep the platform alive and vibrant, as well as to ensure your community can reach people interested in that community. Finally, when the admins contact you, we ask that you respond within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Where moderators consistently are in violation of these guidelines, Reddit may step in with actions to heal the issues - sometimes pure education of the moderator will do, but these actions could potentially include dropping you down the moderator list, removing moderator status, prevention of future moderation rights, as well as account deletion. We hope permanent actions will never become necessary</strong></p>

        <p>Everybody that has gotten, or does get, any ban from unrelated subs like that, please report each of them as harassment.</p>
<p>After just finishing reporting a couple, I think that most ways of reporting them <em>might</em> go back to the sub mods.</p>
<p>The way to be sure that a harassment report goes to reddit admins seems to be ONLY by doing it exactly this way (I'm sorry if I'm mistaken here, but this is the best I've got so far):</p>
<p>Use a web browser and go to https://new.reddit.com/</p>
<p>I think it's likely critical to use new. Rather than just www. or old.</p>
<p>Navigate to "messages".  The URL should be:  https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/  but I think just following this link will <em>not</em> take you to the right place.  It seems like you have to navigate there.</p>
<p>Find the offensive message and capture the permalink.  In android, this is long click and select "copy link", in windows it's like r-click and select "copy link", so do whatever you need to do in your web browser to capture the permalink into the clipboard.</p>
<p>With that link in the clipboard, maybe use a new tab, or not, and go to:  https://reddit.com/report  I think you can follow this link and get to the right place.</p>
<p>Select the choices "I want to report spam or abuse", "this is abusive or harassing", "it's targeted harassment", "At me", and then paste the link in the spot for link.  I don't see any need for "additional information", but you do you.  Just keep in mind you'd be taking up a person's time to read that.  Please be considerate.</p>
<p>This is long to describe, but it's pretty quick and easy to do.</p>
<p>You will get a "Help Center Report" message confirmation.  That's how you know for sure it went to reddit administration, and definitely not back to the perpetrating sub.</p>
