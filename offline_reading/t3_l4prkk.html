    <strong>Bill Gates FAKED his vaccination and I can prove it</strong>
    <p><p><strong>1)</strong> So <a href="https://i.ibb.co/zSSSqvg/2.jpg">here's a screenshot</a> from a video in which Bill Gates talks about vaccines (the video is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCt23D8VXpc&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=CNN">december 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Pay close attention to his hair. Not the way it's arranged, but the color of his hair. It's got lots of shades of black right?</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1352662770416664577/photo/1">here's Bill Gates getting the vaccine</a> a month later, in January 2021. All of the sudden his hair is almost completely white. Sure you could say the lighting is different, but no way the change would be this drastic. It's simply too big of a change. He looks like he's aged about 10 years and he never dyes his hair, either.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://i.ibb.co/kXT3QTc/compare.jpg">let's compare his hair from both pictures</a>. Does the color of his hair look the same? Unless he took a time machine to the future and then came back 10 years older, that's not him. </p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Now let's talk about <a href="https://i.ibb.co/6Rtp5hn/2.jpg">the bump on his forehead from that december 2020 video</a>. You can see the same bump on his forehead in this video from <a href="https://youtu.be/Os5p0vecteg?t=63">July 2020</a> and also in this video from <a href="https://youtu.be/ie6lRKAdvuY?t=554">April 2020</a> so it's been there for who knows how long, but if you <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1352662770416664577/photo/1">check the picture in which "he's getting vaccinated"</a> then guess what, it's miraculously gone.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> The shape of his right ear is different. <a href="https://i.ibb.co/c6nc2yh/09vz5j35mcd61.jpg">Comparison</a>. And  yes, the mask is pushing out his ear, but look at the shape of it. These two ears have a different shape. </p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Why would he take his glasses off in the vaccine pic? He wears them all the time and you don't need to take off your glasses to get the vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> The only picture on the internet in which Bill Gates is wearing a mask is exactly the picture in which he's getting vaccinated. Funny timing, right?</p>
<p>THAT'S. NOT. HIM</p></p>
