    <strong>Event 201 : The Coronavirus Pandemic Simulation That The Media Never Mentions.</strong>
    <p><p>Event 201 <a href="https://youtu.be/Vm1-DnxRiPM">was</a> a coronavirus pandemic simulation exercise organised on the 18th of October 2019 by the World Economic Forum in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University,  the World Bank, various major media corporations  and ....(<em>sips Holy Water</em>)....the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The symptoms were the same, except that it started at a Brazilian pig farm in the simulation. These bodies planned the global response to such a disease.</p>
<p>The event started on the same day as the World Military Games in Wuhan, China. Something like 6 weeks later, we first heard of Covid in the mass media.</p>
<p>To my knowledge,  no major media organisation has seen fit to even mention that this took place since the onset of the outbreak. </p>
<p>Bill Gates has not been asked about this event in any form on CNN or the BBC. His foundation happens to have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/about/funding">donated</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/about/funding">millions</a> of British pounds to the BBC in the past.</p>
<p>I have my own feelings about Bill Gates and what he's really about, but informing you that this event took place is the main purpose of this post.</p>
<p>What is going on here is far darker than many of us can imagine.</p></p>

        <p>I read about this a little while back, shocking. This is all clown bizzaro world. I tell my husband all the time it feels like Gotham or something where almost everyone in power is corrupt and people are let out of jail so they don’t catch covid and have committed crimes again. Not sure it’s gonna get any better.</p>

        <p>Stop with the outrageous conspiracy theories! Just because certain parties had documented foreknowledge of the "pandemic" you think they might be involved? That's preposterous! Obviously 'Event 201', Rockefeller's 'Lock Step', the 'Dark Winter' exercise, and Larry Brilliant's "Contagion" are all just coincidences, and nothing more. </p>
<p>Bill Gates loves Africa, that's why he wants to inject Africa first. Pay no attention to the conspiracy theories that claim Gates' other vaccines have maimed and killed thousands of African children, or that they cause infertility, that's nonsense. Never question the motives of a rich man who wants to inject something into your bloodstream, for free.</p>

        <p>Today I started wondering how anyone could not be a conspiracy theorist at the point of madness we have reached. The government is just like, whoops, we had no idea this would tank the economy, cause suicides and a host of mental illnesses, second order deaths, and destroy millions of lives. Right.</p>

        <p>I have heard of this before. My question is this though: have these simulations been conducted with regularity in the past? The timing doesn’t strike me as significant, unless it had never been done before. But if they run the simulations regularly, then I don’t see this as anything more than a coincidence.</p>

        <p>I would agree, except this is just a bit TOO coincidental. The simulation specifically involved a coronavirus outbreak, only a month before the current coronavirus pandemic, and of course Bill Gates has his fingers in both pies. If the simulation was October of 2018, as I originally misread, or if the pathogen in said simulation was anything other that a coronavirus, perhaps I wouldn't be so suspicious. That would be nice. Pandemics are a natural occurence just like tornadoes, earthquakes, and wildfires, so I'd like to think the same of this particular pandemic. The bubonic plague wasn't some bioweapon created in a laboratory, and it did a much better job of killing and maiming people. Why would a "plandemic" utilize such a mild illness as COVID-19 when there are so many worse bugs to choose from? But the simulation hits too close to home, makes it hard not to believe certain entities either planned the pandemic or at least knew about it sooner than they care to admit.</p>

        <p>It's crazy that people defend Bill Gates, remember back in the 90s when everyone hated him for trying to cut out his partner in Microsoft (Who was fighting cancer) who helped build the company with a deal at IBM that Bill Gates didn't even attend?   </p>
<p>keep looking into this man and his forced vaccinations on tribal children giving them Sexually transmitted diseases and paralyzing people for life in some cases.   </p>
<p>just because a shill defending Gates has more upvotes than this, don't let that sway your mind. do your own research guys and look into him.   </p>
<p>Corbett report does a great documentary on him. u/PensiveAfrican thanks for reminding people about his event, the media won't so it's good that people like yourself do. ignore any negative comments and have a good day sir</p>
