        <p>I'm actually from Canada. The province I'm in has 160,000 people living in it. Today we reported our 160th case TOTAL since this thing started. 0.001% of our entire population has gotten it.</p>
<p>We've had no problems with wearing a mask here, and locking down/imposing restrictions when they were needed.</p>
<p>It's almost like when everyone chips in and goes along with stuff for a little while, it makes it so people don't get sick, and makes it so stuff gets back to normal sooner.</p>
<p>Anyways, enjoy raging all the time about having to wear a piece of cloth on your face.</p>
<p>EDIT: And to note, our province is a conservative lead province.</p>

        <p>Why on earth would you guys lock down and wear masks when the Covid impact has been so minimal? If we let the virus run its course, sure some poor people leeching off the taxpayers would have died because of their poor life choices, but we‚Äôd be back to normal. An acceptable trade off if you ask me.</p>

        <p>We haven't locked down here since the beginning. Everything has been back open here for close to a year at this point.</p>
<p>Why did we wear masks, considering the impact here has been minimal? To keep the impact minimal here. We like being able to live life. If we have to wear a mask when we go to a grocery store for 45 minutes? That's fine. It keeps everything at the state of "minimal", so we don't lock down.</p>
<p>And we also did it so people didn't die. What you said is true, where some people would have died that had been leeching off the government (not a reason to die, but I'll go with your example). But there are way more high risk people that could have died as well. I have an aunt with MS in a nursing home, and a grandfather in his 90's, also in a nursing home. They would both be high risk to get infected. I'd rather help fight a community spread, so that it doesn't end up spreading and reaching them. That's just kind of the mindset here, in general. </p>
<p>We could just not care and do whatever we want. But, putting in a minimal amount of effort has let us live pretty normally. So we're cool with continuing that, I guess.</p>

        <p>We have a population density here higher than 18 US states. We have a smaller population number, but we have a small land area to live on. Yet we still sit at 1 in 1000 being infected, having a considerably high population density for the size.</p>
<p>Then there's the two neighbour provinces we have, which have far higher population, and only slightly higher infection rates as us.</p>
<p>And even with our compliance, we have had spikes. Twice. Where we went into a partial shutdown, limiting the amount of people allowed in businesses. Each outbreak we had got back to zero. Everywhere will get spikes of an illness, regardless of how safe they are. Even with 100% compliance. But those spikes go down pretty quick if everyone works as one to get it back down to zero.</p>

        <p>Tell that to Belgium.  The highest death rate in the world with masks and various lockdowns.  Or Italy, or Spain.  Or the UK.  Try looking outside the US and Canada for your view. I know you want to hold your views that masks work (no evidence that they worked before the pandemic and still no good evidence either) and that Canada is doing such a super duper job that you can be proud of and feel superior for over those dumb anti mask Americans but feelings aside the evidence isn't there.  </p>
<p>It never was:</p>
<p>&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946‚ÄìJuly 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks.</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p>It's good for feelings though:</p>
<p>&rt;Thus we have the means for a self-perpetuating system: the mask symbolically protects against infection just as it represents fear of that infection.</p>

        <p>I will admit, I have no scientific studies that say how definitely effective or ineffective masks are. But I do know that we all banded together and followed these annoying little rules here, and we magically have a 0.001% infection rate. So I can say that they have been an effective tool in the fight.</p>
<p>And those countries are unfortunate examples of "following mandates didn't work". But remember, there are also examples like New Zealand, which handled things very similarly to what my province did. They have an infection rate of 0.0005%. When everyone does their part, stuff can be prevented. If it couldn't be prevented, it's a way harder time to get stuff back to normal, and then keep it healthy. But that isn't a reason to just give up and not do anything.</p>
