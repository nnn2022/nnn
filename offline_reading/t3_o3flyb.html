    <strong>NHS finally cares about false positives, but only after most people have been injected</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know if this has been posted here, but here you go:</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/06/11/the-nhs-just-changed-how-they-count-covid-cases-heres-why/">https://off-guardian.org/2021/06/11/the-nhs-just-changed-how-they-count-covid-cases-heres-why/</a></p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<p>&rt; <strong><em>NHS England has instructed hospitals to make the change to the daily flow of data sent by NHS trusts [â€¦] Hospitals have been told to change the way they collect data on patients infected with coronavirus to</em></strong> <strong>differentiate between those actually sick with symptoms and those who test positive while seeking treatment for something else.</strong> </p>
<p>They're basically saying here that if you would go to the hospital with a broken leg, and your PCR test result says you're positive (without any symptoms) - you enter the statistics as a "covid case". No matter if you don't have symptoms, no matter you went to the hospital for a broken leg. Combine that with the PCR test giving lots of false positives and you get hugely inflated numbers.</p>
<p>This is what skeptics have been saying all along and nobody listens.</p>
<p>The NHS now told everyone to stop doing this and only count covid patients who actually have covid symptoms. To "get a more accurate number" - wow it's almost like they should have done this from the start.</p>
<p><strong>This will massively lower the amount of "covid cases" and will make it look like the vaccin is working.</strong></p></p>

        <p>That's because people who are asymptomatic cannot spread the virus as they simply don't have enough viral load to do so.</p>

<p>No, <em>they've</em> been telling us all along. There are countless videos of government officials stating how they've been inflating Covid numbers and everyone's eyes just glazed over.</p>
