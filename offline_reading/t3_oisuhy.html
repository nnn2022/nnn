    <strong>Weird illness I had a couple of months ago</strong>
    <p><p>Don't know where to start with this one, even the thought of it makes me feel a bit crazy, so I'll get it outta the way with a TL;DR</p>
<p><strong>I had a very strange bout of illness a couple of months ago. The more I read about vaccine side effects the weirder it is, as it's like they're describing everything I went through, however I haven't had the vaccine. Both my mum and mum in law had been vaxxed and even at the time thought it was weird that I got so ill right after I first saw them after getting their vaccinations.</strong></p>
<p>So, this was about 2 months ago. For a week or so, I had been suffering with extremely painful sides. It felt like maybe a kidney infection of some kind, but all tests were coming back negative. Got tested for Covid and that was negative too. Had no other signs of a kidney infection or UTI, except for the pain. Not sure I'd even class it as "pain" really. More like severe discomfort. I couldn't turn or bend. If I needed to walk around a corner I would have to stop and pivot 90 degrees so I could carry on walking forward. It was like my tendons around my hips and back were turning into bone.</p>
<p>I wasn't feeling ill ill, but there was definitely something that didn't feel right. I had a day out on my rust bucket of a boat, did some cleaning, feeling absolutely fine apart from the lack of movement and tightness in my hips and side.</p>
<p>Started driving the boat. Felt a bit of a funny turn so sat down to catch myself. Stood back up and then BAM.</p>
<p>Woke up on the deck, boat still going full speed. I'd collapsed out of nowhere. Woke up with the BIGGEST adrenaline rush I've ever experienced. It was very odd. Going by how far the boat had travelled I was probably out for about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next two weeks, I wasn't able to stand up for longer than 30 seconds without getting the tunnel vision and knowing I would have to lie down or would black out again. Horrible chills. Not quite what you would expect of chills though, I didn't "feel" cold as such, but I couldn't stop shivering. No temperature when ever I would test, but like the boiler in my body was playing up. My feet and hands would go freezing cold whilst my head was burning up, but never had a high temperature. Had loads of weird things with my vision, vertical double vision or not being able to focus my eyes.</p>
<p>But the thing that freaked me out was the heart feelings. Every time I hear about the myocarditis affects from others it's like they're describing my experience. I felt like I was having constant heart attacks or something. I knew I wasn't but the palpitations were like nothing I had experienced before. I even told the doctor I thought I had a heart infection. He looked at me like I was an idiot, but something was telling me, there's something very, very wrong with your heart right now.</p>
<p>I know this is kind of a bullshit post, I just wanted to get it off my chest. It all started happening just after my mum and MIL got vaccinated and at the time I was like oh what a weird co-incidence. I'm probably just being paranoid, but I can't describe this illness. After multiple tests, nothing was found and I was being treated like I was making it all up or it was an anxiety thing, so I just dropped it and eventually started feeling normalish again.</p>
<p>Maybe it was just Covid itself and the disease can have similar symptoms to what the vaccine does? The whole thing left me feeling very confused and honestly I'm not sure if I've even fully recovered now. I don't feel ill any more I'm just tired all the time, but I wasn't feeling like that before all this happened.</p></p>

        <p>Just like that, shooting pains every now and then, just like you said, from hips to ribs and a constant feeling of discomfort or tightness all around my pelvis and groin muscles.</p>

        <p>Are you stressed out? This has happened to me before and they found nothing. I think it is adrenaline buildup and it happens when I’m feeling stressed and having too much caffeine. Sounds like that’s what it could be since you had high blood pressure and that’s it.</p>

        <p>Yeah man, could be. Although I gotta say, no I wasn't stressed at the time, not really. Life was going really well, we had money for the first time in ages, kids were getting older and easier, summer was here and the sun was out. I was feeling great.</p>
<p>There was a lot of anxiety when I was ill though. But it came AFTER collapsing and all the odd muscle pains and stuff. It felt more like I was being spiked with the worlds worst amphetamines. Like E's with no upside.</p>

        <p>Were you taking any supplements? Whenever that happened to me I was taking curcumin so now I avoid it. It’s an maoi and combined with tyramine foods it could contribute to an adrenaline storm. https://www.liquisearch.com/adrenergic_storm/causes</p>

        <p>Literally nothing. Was tested for Covid and that was negative.</p>
<p>Was tested for thyroid, diabetes, full blood work etc. ECG was fine.</p>
<p>The only things slightly off were I had constantly high BP throughout (I'm only 35 and never had high BP in the past, although I'm a smoker so that may have changed) and my Vit D was a bit on the low side (which I thought was odd as I had been supplementing).</p>

        <p>Thanks mate.</p>
<p>It's such a strange situation isn't it. On the one hand it feels like the whole world is falling apart, on the other I'm just at home with my family and everything is almost normal.</p>
<p>That's not quite "stress". It's like we've been put in a situation that forces our minds to gaslight ourselves, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>It's more like slow drip insanity. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that's the end game. The elites love that shit don't they.</p>

<p>This. 100%.  While a milder stress, it still accumulates in your body, over time.  Acute stress is deadly but mild stress over long periods of time, is just as bad for one's body.</p>

<p>Not constantly struggling to breathe, but walking from one side of the house to the other or fuck me, going up the stairs, I would be gasping for breath by the time I got there.</p>

        <p>Way better, but not sure if back to 100%.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell. Before Covid I cycled 100 miles a week but after a year of working from home I can't get back into the groove. I'd probably find I couldn't breathe like I used to, but that could be just getting out of shape.</p>
<p>But I was really gasping for air going up the stairs for a couple of weeks during the worst of it.</p>

        <p>Mmm.. I used to cycle with 2 other guys and one of them has the same heart issues as me, he was in ER all night.</p>
<p>The 3rd one is avoiding the injection. </p>
<p>2 of 3 cyclists and you..? I'm probably just seeing a silly pattern :) Glad to hear you're on the mend and things do get better.</p>

        <p>They probably gave you spike proteins which gave you the symptoms.  I wonder if you did an antibody test what it would show</p>

        <p>I have found that pharmacists are way more educated in medications than doctors. If you are on any type of medicines, I  would ask your local pharmacist about NAC supplements and any interactions. Usually there are no interactions with NAC unless you are on Chemo, have cancer or blood thinners. NAC is an amino acid that works as an antioxidant that repairs and builds new cells. The spike protein attaches to the cells. It’s worth a try if you are still feeling badly. </p>

        <p>See my post of today, is it safe to be around vaxxed people?</p>
<p>I feel like intuition is saying stay away. But I feel like dying inside because there goes the last of any friends or social connection. </p>
<p>I am already very chronically ill on edge of lupus. If more was to enter the picture it could be the end of my life.</p>

        <p>I feel you. I read your post and I completely understand.</p>
<p>I know I'm very lucky to be in the position I am. There are single people out there who live in flats and don't even have a garden to enjoy, in countries with much worse Covid policies than mine.</p>
<p>Are you in the US? I'm from the UK and at least where I live I think society hasn't gone full retard quite yet. I rarely talk to random people but I heard people complaining about the shot in the shop and started chatting to them, within a minute the whole shop was taking their masks off and moaning about it all. You could see the relief on people's faces when the mask came off and they could just be a human again.</p>
<p>I probably can't give you much useful advice cos I'm just not that smart lol, but if I were in your situation (assuming you're in the US) I would move somewhere more rural. At least my perception is that there are lots of states and towns where people would be less likely to suckle government teet.</p>
