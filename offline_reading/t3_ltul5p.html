    <strong>"I think lockdowns should continue."</strong>
    <p><p>Speaking with someone outside the US, and sharing that I had heard their weekend-long lockdowns might be ending soon, and expecting them to be excited and relieved, only to hear that they think the lockdowns should continue...CONTINUE.</p>
<p>These people are literally locked down EVERY weekend--all weekend, due to the scamdemic. They have been for months. To hear a YOUNG and HEALTHY twenty-something anxiously insist that it would be disastrous to end this restriction just enrages me.</p>
<p>How effing selfish and self-centered and ignorant ARE people???</p></p>
