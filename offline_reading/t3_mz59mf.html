    <strong>Even if the death rate was 15%</strong>
    <p><p>I would still want to hug, dance, eat at a restaurant, play sport, use the gym etc etc.  Doomers seem to think life is about survival at all costs, it’s actually way more than that.</p></p>

        <p>I disagree.  15% would be huge.  Most likely social collapse.  </p>
<p>But 15% is high enough kill rate where the disease would kill those without immunity quickly and soon immunity within a population would be achieved.  So at least there would be a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>With Covid, there shouldn’t even be a tunnel</p>

        <p>I’d argue that the measures we have in Ontario (total lockdown that’s so bad you’re not allowed to by spoons) should only be implemented if the death rate is over 10%. Freedom is worth death. Even if it means it my family that dies.</p>

        <p>You need to keep people working. That’s how the economy works. If people don’t work it’s way more harmful than this virus. And regardless the point of the post is that if this virus was as bad as we’ve been told, you wouldn’t need to bribe people to stay home. No one wants to die. If people were actually scared because the virus was actually deadly they would stay home on their own.</p>

        <p>Without people no economy, if everyone dies to a disease then there wont be an economy to fuck up.</p>
<p>&rt;if this virus was as bad as we’ve been told</p>
<p>Yes rhe death rate is low, BUT it is highly infectious. Wearing masks, lockdowns etc. lowers the chances of infection thus gettig rid of most deaths. If we didnt have masks infection rates would be much higher and there would be more cases and more deaths.</p>

        <p>15% is kinda high tbh, depends on the victims. If it can kill anybody, we sure would have to be more careful. Doesn't mean we need to put the people in lockdowns like fucking animals at the zoo tho.</p>

        <p>There are many, many worse things than dying of a disease. Living in a cage for most of your adult life, for example. Or dying of loneliness and depression. The latter is far more painful.</p>

        <p>I'm going to disagree with the premise. If we had an infectious disease that killed 15% of the population indiscriminately I would happily sit inside and wait for it to burn out. Not because the government said so but because that would be a catastrophic and potentially civilization ending type of outbreak. </p>
<p>Don't do shit because the government says so. Do it because its the right thing to do. </p>
<p>But with COVID we don't have a 15% death rate. We don't even have a 1% death rate or even a 0.5% death rate. We have an IFR hovering between 0.15 and 0.25% clustered almost exclusively in the oldest sickest people in society. </p>
<p>It's about calculated risk assessment.</p>

        <p>The government at most should have issued specific warnings and guidance for who was most at risk and how to behave if you don’t want to become infected. If that was done we would have saved many more lives than with this one size fits all strategy. The government underestimated the people and it hurt us. Now we have an institutionalized fear of nature that will damage us for decades.</p>

        <p>My friends grandma who was in her 90s supposedly died of Covid. The past year this poor woman lived in a nursing home and couldn’t touch her family. There is pictures of my friend and her kids visiting with a plastic wall shielding her grandma from them. This woman traveled the world during her life and was a bad ass. It was so sad to see those pictures that she was literally living as a caged animal the last year of her life. My friend went on to post this is why people should get vaccinated to save people like my grandma. Not to be a bitch but she was in her 90s, in a nursing home. Like how much life is left? If I’m in my 90s and reliant on others to do the most basic tasks I hope a respiratory virus just goes ahead and offs me</p>

<p>And people have been doing that for almost a year in China and other countries. All it required was hard quarantine, masks and social distancing for a couple of months. Instead of this shit show thats going on now.</p>

        <p>Don't know why you are getting downvoted. You left a very civil comment. It's sad to see alternatives to r/politics become it's mirror image.</p>
<p>I'll tell you why I'm sceptical of the vaccines and lockdowns. First of all, I live in Sweden so we only have some mild restrictions and no lockdowns or mask mandates. But, what I'm mainly sceptical about (or outright against) is overreacting out of fear. Studies in Sweden have shown that the death rate for anyone under the age of 70 is almost exactly the same as that of the flu and for people 70+ with co-morbidites it jumps up to 5%, and ends at 21% for males, 85+ with co-morbidites.</p>
<p>It looks like COVID-19 is much deadlier than the flu for old people with co-morbidities. But for anyone younger than that? Not really. Was a lockdown the right choice? I think we have to factor in how the lockdown hurt the economy and the psychological effects it had. And we basically know that now: There are studies showing that lockdowns have increased 'Deaths Of Despair' by anything from 10% to 60%. That's a disaster. In America, you now have an unemployment rate of 20%, almost equal that of The Great Depression and wealth has been moved from the middle-class, and small businesses, to the Big Corporations. </p>
<p>I personally think this could have been handled A LOT better. This virus doesn't warrant this kind of devastation. It's not even close to the death rate of Ebola for example, which is at 60%. We could have been extra careful to protect our elders without shutting down our economy, or closing our schools (that's a whole other area of research, the poor children who don't get to develop basic social skills because of isolation) and drastically lowering peoples quality of life.</p>
<p>And from this I think you can conclude why I'm against someone using a vaccine that is rushed, and not yet even FDA-approved, as a carrot to get me, a young healthy man, to enjoy my basic liberties. I'm not against vaccines in themselves, I'm against this particular vaccine, in this particular time.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>

        <p>It's a slightly weird conflict in your thoughts. You're not a fan of a lockdown for an illness that causes problems for a small number of people. So you're saying, let's not overreact and let's look at how there's no problem for the majority of people and let's take the most appropriate action.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the vaccine - which causes zero problem in the majority of people - you're on the side of "let's wait". You probably listen and read to the stories of the minority and want to follow their lead.</p>
<p>It feels a bit conflicting.</p>
<p>Also, let's go back in time a little bit. When lockdowns were announced, certainly in the UK, we didn't know enough about this virus. All we knew was that it was killing people at a faster rate than flu. We didn't really know how it was affecting younger people long term. They seemed to be able to fight it off and not die but obviously we had zero stats on long term problems. It was a new illness.</p>
<p>The facts that we had was that it was killing people, it was hospitalising people, on a much bigger scale than we'd seen. Maybe still small numbers overall but bigger than we'd seen.</p>
<p>Maybe they panicked. Maybe we could have protected certain groups while allowing others to carry on. But that doesn't sound easy and the option they took was a lockdown.</p>
<p>I'm happy to debate the pros and cons but regardless, I think a lockdown was a reasonable option. Maybe not the absolute best, definitely not the worst. I can see why they did it. I don't think it's part of a big oppressive plan. Its just a decision almost every country took, based on all the knowledge they had. I'm not sure I blame them for that.</p>

        <p>Not really, that's hardly the point. The point is that I'm a man in my 20's and I have no need for the vaccine whatsoever. The risk of me dying from COVID-19 is 0.0003%.  And nobody knows what the long-term side-effects of the vaccine might be. It's not FDA-approved yet. That's why I'm cautious, not against it, but cautious.</p>
<p>What's making me even more sceptical of this whole spectacle is the COVID-PASS that is about to be introduced. We skeptics were called mad conspiracy theories just a year ago for warning about where this sort of medical hysteria would lead. Now we're in a situation where half the population is panicking as if The Spanish Flu has made a return and ever man, woman and child who is criticizing this sort of year-long panic attack is branded as a 'superspreader' or a mass murderer. I hope you at least agree that children and young healthy people are not mass murderers for taking a walk in the park without a mask on. But that's where many people are.</p>
<p>Actually, Fauci wrote a report on COVID in March, 2020 called 'Navigating The Uncharted' where he himself claimed that COVID was hardly much worse than the flu. The lockdowns have done far more harm than good, far more. Hopefully the economy will recover after The Great Reset... Right?... Right.</p>

        <p>The vaccine isn't for you. There are plenty of reports that being vaccinated stops symptoms which stops you from passing it on. If you're not coughing or sneezing, you're much less likely to pass it on.</p>
<p>You should take the vaccine to protect the people around you. The person who touches the thing you touched after you, who has an underlying condition they didn't know about.</p>
<p>Your elderly relatives who you might go and see.</p>
<p>A million different scenarios.</p>
<p>People should take the vaccine to either stop themselves getting ill and potentially dying, or to reduce the risk to others! It's not always all about you as an individual.</p>
<p>I got the MMR vaccine. Measles and mumps wasn't going to kill me. But it stops the spread.</p>

        <p>There's no surface spread according to the CDC. Come on, man.</p>
<p>Why haven't we used the same model for dealing with the flu? Why didn't we implement mask mandates, a vaccine cast system and a lockdown to try to save the 80,000 people who died from the flu in 2018? Because society is not organized around raw safety. Raw safety would end in tyranny, which is what we're seeing creeping up now. A sort of medical social-credit system.</p>
<p>I'm not saying people should be cautious, or not take the vaccine if they're comfortable with it, or even wear a mask if they believe it helps. But we have to seriously consider what the ramifications for society will be if vaccines become mandatory and lockdowns become a normal part of everyday life.</p>
<p>I didn't take a vaccine for the flu when I visited my grandma in 2018. I won't take one now when I do either. I will ask her if she's okay with it, take the necessary precautions, and stay away if I'm sick.</p>
<p>Lastly, I repeat myself the vaccine has NO LONG-TERM STUDIES. If you are comfortable being a guinea pig for an experimental vaccine, that's on you. I'm not doing it, and anyone that claims I have to should think about what they've become.</p>

        <p>I think you may have to revisit your thoughts.</p>
<p>Travelling anywhere out of the country will require a vaccine passport. Getting into some workplaces. Getting your kids into school or nursery. Going to any sort of holiday place. Getting any insurance.</p>
<p>You will struggle without a vaccine I believe.</p>
<p>And my philosophy is that every single person should get every single vaccine available. If we do that, some diseases will become obsolete, like smallpox is. That is the ideal outcome.</p>

        <p>I'm in my 20s, perfectly healthy, and work from home, yet the vaccine is available to me. So it's safe to assume anyone who actually needs it has either gotten it, or decided not to. </p>
<p>That being said, I hope you are right because I really want my freedom back ASAP.</p>
