        <p>From the article: "A clinical scientist and immunologist-virologist at a southern California laboratory says he and colleagues from 7 universities are suing the CDC for massive fraud. The reason: <strong>not one</strong> of 1500 samples of people tested “positive” could find Covid-19. ALL people were simply found to have Influenza A, and to a lesser extent Influenza B. This is consistent with the previous findings of other scientists, which we have reported on several times."</p>

        <p>This is something I can't get over. Only China "claims" to have a vaccine made from isolated covid virus. How is this even possible?</p>

        <p>“Michael Laue from one of the world’s most important representatives of the COVID-19 “panicdemic,” the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI), answered that [1]:”</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/31/phantom-virus-in-search-of-sars-cov-2/">I am not aware of a paper which purified isolated SARS-CoV-2.”</a></p>
<p><strong>“They didn’t isolate the virus, that is the issue.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;-<strong>Dr. Wu Zunyou</strong>, the Chief Epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention</p>
<p><em>Quote at 1:38 in NBC video from January 2021:</em></p>
<p>“Return to Wuhan: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YbSdG2imqEM&amp;feature=emb_title">What Life Is Like One Year Later | NBC Nightly News”</a></p>
<p>&rt;“He answered, “They didn’t isolate the virus.” He was referring to tissue samples taken from animals sold at the market.</p>
<p>&rt;That’s an interesting answer.  Why have researchers and scientists claimed SARS-CoV-2 crossed species from animals to humans at that market, when no one ever isolated the virus from samples taken at the market?</p>
<p>&rt;The next, and <strong>far bigger question, is: When Dr. Zunyou says, “They didn’t isolate the virus,” is he ONLY referring to tissue samples taken from animals at the market? Or does his answer also apply to the first 40 human cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, which were claimed to result from a newly discovered coronavirus?</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2021/02/16/they-didnt-isolate-the-virus/">I’ve queried Dr. Zunyou. We’ll see if he replies.”</a></p>
<p>&rt;”Yes, there have since been papers saying they’ve produced viral isolates. But there are no controls for them. The CDC produced a paper in July, I think it was, where <strong>they said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you know what they did? They swabbed one person.</strong> One person, who’d been to China and had cold symptoms. One person. <strong>And they assumed he had it to begin with. So it’s all full of holes, the whole thing.”</strong> ^1
&rt;-Dr. Kevin Corbett, P.h.D.</p>
<p><strong>Christian Drosten created</strong> the fraudulent “Covid” PCR test:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”without having virus material available”</strong> ^1 ^2</p>
<p>&rt;“relying instead on the <strong>Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence</strong> published on the internet” ^2 ^1</p>

        <p>&rt;I believe that China and the globalists have set up this Covid hoax (the flu disguised as a new virus) to establish a global tyranny and totalitarian control police state. This intrigue included (also) massive election fraud to overthrow Trump.</p>
<p>This paragraph was completely unnecessary to the article, and seriously undermines credibility. Just stick to one issue.</p>
