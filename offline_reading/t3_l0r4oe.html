    <strong>Judge Williams Young's 2001 speech to the Shoe Bomber is insanely relevant in 2021</strong>
    <p><p>We need someone to rebuke the lockdowners and wokeists like judicial badass William Young did to Richard Reid in 2001. Relevant parts are bold. If one judge gave a speech to a woke lockdown-supporting anti-free speech asshole like this it would go viral and change everything.</p>

<p><em>"In a very real sense Trooper Santiago had it right when first you were taken off that plane and into custody and you wondered where the press and where the TV crews were and you said you’re no big deal.</em> <strong><em>You’re no big deal.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>What your counsel, what your able counsel and what the equally able United States attorneys have grappled with and what I have as honestly as I know how tried to grapple with, is why you did something so horrific. What was it that led you here to this courtroom today? I have listened respectfully to what you have to say.</em> <strong><em>And I ask you to search your heart and ask yourself what sort of unfathomable hate led you to do what you are guilty and admit you are guilty of doing.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>And I have an answer for you. It may not satisfy you. But as I search this entire record it comes as close to understanding as I know.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>It seems to me you hate the one thing that to us is most precious. You hate our freedom. Our individual freedom. Our individual freedom to live as we choose, to come and go as we choose, to believe or not believe as we individually choose.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Here, in this society, the very winds carry freedom. They carry it everywhere from sea to shining sea. It is because we prize individual freedom so much that you are here in this beautiful courtroom. So that everyone can see, truly see that justice is administered fairly, individually, and discretely.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>It is for freedom’s seek that your lawyers are striving so vigorously on your behalf and have filed appeals, will go on in their, their representation of you before other judges. We care about it. Because we all know that the way we treat you, Mr. Reid, is the measure of our own liberties.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Make no mistake though. It is yet true that we will bear any burden; pay any price, to preserve our freedoms.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Look around this courtroom. Mark it well. The world is not going to long remember what you or I say here. Day after tomorrow it will be forgotten. But this, however, will long endure. Here, in this courtroom, and courtrooms all across America, the American people will gather to see that justice, individual justice, justice, not war, individual justice is in fact being done.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The very President of the United States through his officers will have to come into courtrooms and lay out evidence on which specific matters can be judged, and juries of citizens will gather to sit and judge that evidence democratically, to mold and shape and refine our sense of justice.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>See that flag, Mr. Reid? That’s the flag of the United States of America. That flag will fly there long after this is all forgotten. That flag still stands for freedom. You know it always will.</em></strong> <em>Custody, Mr. Officer. Stand him down."</em></p>
