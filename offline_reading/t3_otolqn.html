    <strong>My sister just checked into the hospital...</strong>
    <p><p>... she got her second shot of Pfizer just a week or two ago. She insisted on getting the vaccine so she could "stop wearing masks" and "travel to Cancun" </p>
<p>She thinks it's panic attacks. It is not and I am telling her it's the damn second shot. She has been having chest pain, shortness of breath (one flight of stairs has her winded), diarrhea, and rapid heart rate, most especially this past weekend. I told her this is a telltale sign of myocarditis. Her and my brother are brushing it off as "maybe it is, maybe it isn't" because it is "so rare" but I am going to die on this hill if I need to, and say it was the Pfizer "vaccine" - I am so angry right now.</p></p>

        <p>No, of course not. But anecdotes lead to questions and questions lead to hypotheses.</p>
<p>While I am sure there is a lot of bullshit posted on this sub, the incentive is far less than to post bullshit coming in the opposite direction. You can test this information with information from your personal circle in the real world, incongruencies in the literature and national statistics can help develop a more accurate picture of the issue.</p>

        <p>Try to be kind with her. She’s going through a very tough and scary moment, and not to be morbid but you never know how long you get with your loved ones.</p>
<p>Be kind and loving, she can’t unvaccinated herself it doesn’t help to say you told her so. Anger in difficult situations is normal but make sure you aren’t directing it at those you care about</p>

        <p>This is exactly why I came here, because I know she is scared, and I don't want to make things worse. I would never say I told her so, but I had always been very forthcoming about my fears on this vaccine and they always made it seem like I was overreacting. But yes, I am going to be supportive, and just had to vent.</p>

        <p>That is very honest and very healthy use of anon social media. </p>
<p>I am super sad but also pissed at my sister and BIL for getting these shots. She is overweight and they both eat fast food 2-3 times a week. And now she’s had a slew of “really weird medical stuff” come up. </p>
<p>I will be supporting and loving to her directly, but it breaks my heart and sometimes ya just gotta scream into the void online. </p>

        <p>Thank you! :) My first reaction was extreme anger and then the realization that it can't be undone and how best to work through this. I am hoping I am extremely wrong and off target here regarding all the symptoms pointing to a heart inflammation, but not too hopeful.</p>

<p>I think everyone here all WANTS to be very very wrong about this. Fuck if the vaxxed are all fine in 2-3 years I’ll be fine with egg on my face and wear a sign that says “I’m anti science and an idiot”</p>

        <p>I think to be fair to her, the cost-benefit analysis of taking the vaccination is more skewed for people who are obese. Obesity is the single worst risk factor for severe disease from SARS-Cov2. It's definitely a tough decision to make when you are at risk for the virus, because the odds are so heavily skewed in the age and weight categories.</p>

        <p>That is what you would hope for. I think the vaccine is so controversial that this is what people are resorting to. For example, if somehow I felt compelled to get the shot because my job required it, I don’t know if I could bring myself to tell my parents who insisted none of us get it. It’s almost like you don’t want to disappoint someone so you do it on the sly and hope all goes well. I think that is what happened here. Something compelled her to get it but she didn’t want to upset him or cause a fight so she figured, I’ll be like everyone I see on tv and I’ll get the shot and be just fine and life will go on. Except it didn’t and now obviously made everything worse. 😐</p>

        <p>My grandma also got it without telling me or my mom even though I had been begging her for months to take a look at the articles and studies I had been sending her. Even tried to summarize the important ones through text so she’d have no excuse to be uninformed. Woke up the morning of my birthday of all days to call my mom and she said my grandma was still in bed (around 10:30am) which was super unusual for her. I even made my mom check on her and she said she was just sleeping. Fast forward to 30 minutes later my mom calls me FRANTICALLY saying that my grandma got up to go to the bathroom and she heard a loud bang, rushes in to find my grandma seizing on the ground in between the toilet in the bathtub. She had fallen and cracked her head and broken bones in her spine. Was vomiting and having seizures and going in and out of consciousness. I rushed to the hospital to meet the ambulance when they showed up. Her bestfriend showed up too and knowing how I felt about the c19 vaccine, told me about how my grandma had secretly received her second dose less than 48 hours beforehand. I’ve never been so angry and devastated in my life. I had been SCREAMING on the top of the mountain for months and months and she DID NOT LISTEN. So. There it is. I don’t get any joy out of being right. But it is what it is now. For context she’s 72 and before this was on zero meds and was very self sufficient. After this incident, she’s had to have a pacemaker put in and is on a lot of meds now.</p>

        <p>I was telling my grandma since the pandemic started that the numbers absolutely do not add up, and this is likely a push for some vaccines at some point. Sure enough. Told her the results of the preliminary tests they were doing, told her the case of the lady who lost feeling in her arms and legs and "couldn't feel God anymore" following the AZ shot, she was supposedly religious so I reminded her how the bible says the mark of the beast is given in the arm or on the face, I showed her the CDC numbers and explained how the PCR test makes them irrelevant, I told her we've never been able to vaccinate against coronaviruses, I told her everything. Called her every other day and she seemed so awake and present, we had fantastic conversations every day. Then she stopped calling. Finally found out she had taken the shots. 3 months later she was in and out of the hospital for heart issues, they said she was having "crazy thoughts" and she wasn't able to talk anymore. Then that was it.</p>
<p>At least we had some good conversations while we could. Words can't describe the vitriol I feel when I hear "do it to save grandma". This has never been about science. This has never been about saving lives. This has been about expanding the power and money of a very few. And we all know who those people could be. It's a sick world and most people aren't strong enough to accept it to be able to do anything about it.</p>

She has bullied him into getting it too. Recently he did but says he won’t go for the second shot.

        <p>Baby aspirin. I did see a report from a doctor on here that said under a microscope, blood from a high percentage of vaxxed people (I forget the percentage) was loaded with microscopic blood clots. Which would lead to eventual death in most cases according to this report. Who knows how true that is. But it certainly has worried now.</p>

<p>If it happens... I'm out. Unfortunately due to a misguided youth I'm military,  so I'm in and out a lot. Not many deployments going in now, but a week here a month there. So I generally have to trust that my wife is doing her research about healthcare and whatnot.</p>
<p>I'm really in a bad place right now.</p>
<p>Edit: Would willingly allow agent Smith into her body to claw me back into the matrix level blue pill.</p>

        <p>What are you gonna do when it becomes mandatory for military? I'm also in the militairy and if it comes to that point I will still refuse. I might get discharged, but if they are willing to discharge me over refusing to get the vaccine then fuck it whatever, I'll be dead before I get the clot shot. </p>

        <p>Just ask questions when it comes time for those "series" of vaccines if you get stationed overseas (5 years ).</p>
<p>Or you suddenly come down on orders to get deployed "somewhere".</p>
<p>Your reenlistment code will be RE4 (banned from enlistment).</p>

        <p>My husband , while I was with my 4 year old at his doctor’s appointment and then running errands with him, was driven by our neighbor (one of his closest friends) to get the V. Like, he didn’t even drive to get it…. The neighbor made sure he got it. This happened today. It’s really hard for me to process this because I even called him right before he got the S asking him, “are you sure you want to do this? You don’t think it’s weird he’s making sure you get it??” And he said no. Gotta go. </p>
<p>And he got the S. Now, we are not anti Vs. but, we both were on the same page about researching it more and to not feel peer pressured… by our friends. I have sent tons of research papers and articles from all different countries before this over the last few weeks. And he was undecided. </p>
<p>But, damn, our neighbor “had to drive him to make sure he got it today.” And I’m super pissed. And I am angry. Because no one should be driven to get a medical procedure to make sure it’s done…again, not anti V…. I just feel super anxious now and am running on a treadmill as I type this just to help my anxiety…..</p>

My relatives keep telling me how COVID can cause blood clotting but, evidently, so can the vaccines- the media just don't frontline it like it does with the virus. What vaccine did she take?</p>

        <p>Thanks. It seems like those who had myocarditis mostly recovered in a bit. I hope that is the case for her, too. They're running tests but we know how long <em>that</em> takes in hospitals (in the USA, for reference).</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s the upside here, is that for most the myocarditis is treatable and only temporary. I understand brushing it off, I don’t think the average person wants to admit something is seriously wrong with them ya know? Fingers crossed for her. Anxiety is long term, don’t know what is the lesser of the 2 evils here.</p>

        <p>My daughter got the shot too. She now suffers from vertigo. Sometimes it’s so bad she can’t get out of bed and it’s affecting her ability to work. She refuses to admit it was the shot. She refuses to tell me any other symptoms and thinks I’m a conspiracy theorist. I sent her supplements (zinc, quercetin, magnesium,iodine, vitamin D) but I have no way of knowing if she’s taking them. I even ordered ivermectin for just in case. I’m really worried. One of my coworkers started complaining after the second shot. He is now out indefinitely. They removed seven clots. My other coworker had swelling and bleeding behind his left eye. He lost vision in his left eye. He was also hospitalized with really high bp. His doctor told him he shouldn’t have gotten the shot because he already had COVID. They got Moderna. My daughter got Pfizer.</p>

        <p>They ran bloodwork, did X-rays, and an EKG and apparently found nothing. That just doesn’t sit well with me. They put her on a potassium drip and sent her on her way. They also referred her to a cardiologist. Hate to be a pessimist but I don’t think this is the last of this issue with my sister. I’m also more concerned they didn’t find a thing to explain her chest pain and rapid heart rate. Sigh.</p>

        <p>I've heard that this vaccine is causing microscopic blood clots which do not show up on any kind of scan due to their size and that may contribute to any of the brain fog, clotting, loss of energy, loss of the ability to exert one's self, memory loss, loss of motor function and so on. </p>
