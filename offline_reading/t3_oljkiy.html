    <strong>Swine Flu Vaccination Rates</strong>
    <p><p>Recently, the County of Los Angeles reinstated an indoor mask mandate</p>
<p>On the subs r/Coronavirus and r/LosAngeles, people were blaming anti0vaxxers for this, calling the selfish (while avoiding assigning any responsibility, let alone blame, to the county health department)</p>
<p>So I was wondering. What was the vaccination rate of the previous pandemic? Was it 90%? 80% Or even only 60%?</p>
<p>The answer was <strong>25%</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20100401/1-in-4-americans-got-swine-flu-vaccine">http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20100401/1-in-4-americans-got-swine-flu-vaccine</a></p>
<p>For the state of California, it was even lower, at 21%. By sharp contrast, the overall COVID-19 vaccination rate in Los Angeles County is about 60%.</p>
<p>Why were so many people hesitant about the swine flu vaccine? Were they ethics dunces? Were they selfish people who did not care if they action killed others? Should the swine flu vaccine been mandated? Should vaccine passports been enforced back then?</p></p>

        <p>Viral vaccines are a cash cow for murderous and malevolent pharmaceutical industrial complex robber barons. that's why. People knew it back then but Obama was president, and Bush before him was an establishment darling. covid19 was overplayed because it was easy under the Trump presidency with the state of the propaganda media on both sides. All they needed was another cataclysmic event to blow up into their new snake oil sale. People were just ready to be deathly afraid, still clamouring about a climate apocalypse and 'right wing terrorism' (nobody is more right wing behind closed doors than establishment Democrats). It's in the airwaves.</p>

        <p>There was no attempt to stop the flu by vaccination. It would not be possible given low effectiveness of flu vaccines. Flu has lower IFR, you get a vaccine to prevent being sick for five days.</p>

        <p>Ugh i was a kid when that one came out and i remember my mom screaming at me to get in the van because if i dont im putting everyone at risk and they will die.</p>
<p>Thank fuck i have my own house now because if i had to spend covid with my parents id probably blow my brains out. They got their 2nd "phiser" vaccines a few days ago. Didnt even do enough research to learn how to fucking spell it.</p>
<p>Rip my parents. An eternity in the sulfur pits because they chose vacations for them and medical tyranny for everyone who isnt part of their jab cult over mind body and soul.</p>

        <p>Ironically, I contracted swine flu in Los Angeles. Sickest id ever been, tbh I didn’t even know there was a vaccine available for it. Because it wasn’t incessantly on the news like this one is maybe?</p>
