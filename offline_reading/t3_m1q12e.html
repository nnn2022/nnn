    <strong>"This would've been over if people had listened"</strong>
    <p><p>More of a rant I guess so please pardon my venting, but I cannot comprehend what people mean when they say things like "well if people had respected the lockdown for the first month this would have been over by now", like how so? My country is rather small and I keep hearing this, and say we quarantined for an entire month and there are no traces of the virus left and everyone is healthy, then what? You close the borders forever? You don't let anyone else in or out in fear of the virus?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Take a look at NZ for example, you see people there berating other countries because they did lockdown and because they complied life is back to normal. That didn't last long as they have cases again. They didn't think the virus would come back from outside?  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And the cherry on top is the vaccination issue, if you get vaccinated apparently it doesn't give you immunity, it doesn't stop the spread, and there are new strains that outpace the vaccine creation, so what's the point?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm not denying covid nor encouraging people to be reckless just for the sake of being reckless, I just wish we could take a more rational approach, things like if you're sick stay home, get the right nutrition, focus on your personal health, etc. Instead of nuking the economy and condemning people to poverty, mental health issues, tyranny and so on.</p></p>

        <p>I think so too, as if it wasn't enough with all the existent divisions (which have been increasing a lot in the past 10 years) now we have to deal with this. Meanwhile crony politicians are making a fortune and extending control over its population, basically their dream come true.</p>

        <p>Such a stupid line. Lockdowns donâ€™t work. Even if all things had stopped. Nurses, police, firefighters, Mail carriers, delivery people, power plant workers, gas stations shut down, and truckers all stayed home. That would not have stopped the virus. After the initial weeks, once you open again, the virus spreads again. </p>
<p>The only way out is through it. We have to build herd immunity. That being said, there was NOTHING broadcast about ways to build your immune system so that a healthy population can withstand a virus. </p>

        <p>Your logic is flawed.</p>
<p>The seatbelt is designed to protect the person wearing it. You COVID safety zealots have turned that concept on its head--in your twisted version of reality equating masks to seatbelts, the seatbelt doesn't protect you, it protects the drunk driver who veers into your lane and causes a head-on collision, and prevents you from being ejected through the windshield, killing the drunk.</p>
<p>Wear your mask. None of us on NNN are arguing against your right to do so, if it makes you feel safer.  Just don't project your hypochondriac paranoia onto everyone else.</p>

        <p>Try again, small brain.  Common sense tradeoffs. The person driving really fast is the dangerous outlier and is a false equivalency. I'm talking about the rest of us:</p>
<p>https://www.iihs.org/api/datastoredocument/bibliography/2188</p>
<p>"Conclusions: Higher speed limits can yield societal benefits through reduced travel time, but there is a price to pay in terms of additional lives lost. Those responsible for managing the roadway system must recognize and carefully consider this trade-off before deciding to increase speed limits."</p>
<p>Before so many of us became Covidiot safety zealots, we understood this tradeoff. How many grandmas were killed in traffic accidents, and why weren't you lobbying for "Speed Limit Zero" like you are now clamoring for "COVID Zero" before we can ditch the useless masks?</p>
<p>If nanny statists like you were in charge, there would be no Interstate highway system. (Or Autobahn, Autostrada, or whatever Euro equivalent, if you are a Euro Leftist...you get the idea--the same studies were done there).</p>
<p>People will die no matter what the speed limit is.  But you Leftists put feelings before facts.  </p>
<p>In your world we will upend society to "save just one life."  Grow up.</p>

        <p>It's like being told okay, we're going to set the speed limit at 60 and people still die then being told okay, that didn't work, so new limit is 50 and people still die. Eventually, you'll end up with a speed limit of 10 or driving is banned</p>
