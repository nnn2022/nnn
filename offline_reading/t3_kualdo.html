<p>If you close it to read-only it's destroyed too, don't commit their crimes for them.</p>
<p>A re-organisation plan should be created - or spread in case it already exists, what I assume, as this warning come months ago already.</p>

        <p>Na that's all reactive. I'm not saying read-only = private sub. Work to gain more engagement - expecting the same system and processes that keeps failing to succeed is madness.  You're either being dishonest or are ignorant.  </p>
<p>It has to be read-only now and membership needs to be vetted.   </p>
<p>Literally every other sub that isn't blowing Biden with a mask on is being shutdown.</p>

        <p>That's such a bad idea. If you close it you are killing it. Transparency is the key ! and participation.</p>
<p>There's more and more people awakening and they need informations. Looking for places to educate themselves. But there's no education without communication. </p>

        <p>Closing it is a terrible idea, I'm half-sorry I used that as a clickbait title.  </p>
<p>The mods need to put in work to make it read-only, as explained in my post.     </p>
<p>&rt; There's more and more people awakening and they need informations. Looking for places to educate themselves. But there's no education without communication.   </p>
<p>You'll get the opposite if it's left as is. Spez will literally edit you comments, ban you from the platform, appoint stooges and endlessly upvote "wear mask for grandma" messages.   </p>
<p>&rt; Let's not be like the other side.   </p>
<p>I'm sorry to be harsh here but go fuck yourself. There's one side that's literally murdering, harassing, canceling and deplatforming anyone who so much as asks "Should I wear a mask?". Comparing it to the other side who does not support murdering children, police and red hats while Burning and Looting isn't being honest.   </p>

<p>You're either ignorant or dishonest by making such statements. This group will not exist as is for any meaningful amount of time.</p>

        <p>Calling for the death of this sub should bring up a bit of criticism. I'm not sorry you're so affected by being called out on such actions.    </p>
<p>Insulting me and dismissing my points doesn't change them.  </p>
<p>It's not okay to murder folks for red hats. Comparing that to "we should protect this sub" makes you a dishonest asshole.  </p>
<p>Here's an idea, how about you don't support street murders - then you won't have to worry about being called out for supporting street murders.    </p>
<p>You're either being dishonest or ignorant. This sub and it's users will be targeted, canceled and doxxed. Pretending that isn't true is fucked up.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you're talking of going private - might as well ban the sub ourselves then.  </p>
<p>I think it'd be better to go flaired only and we should recruit mods who only flair folks who've demonstrated agreement that it's not okay to destroy the world to save the world.   </p>
<p>But I don't know much about moding/reddit outside of they sell shit like "oh hey we're kicking gma and everyone else out of her 0 positive covid community" resulting in half the community being dead within weeks.   </p>
<p>Walking around the community is good for grandma. Locking her into a motel 6 and acting shocked she died from not receiving proper care is bad for grandma.   </p>
<p>Bonus points because gma is added to the "COVID DEATH COUNT" we're pounded with a few times an hour.</p>
