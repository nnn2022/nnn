        <p>I would heavily disagree. This puts a bad connotation around science. Good, pure science is a pure joy and wonder of our world. </p>
<p>Disgraceful, fake, and political science is the scum of this earth.</p>

        <p>I liked it.  </p>
<p>&rt;A new citizenry now develops, but it is more fragile and dependent than any before it. They are dependent, for their physical and mental health, on scientists who deliver them a steady supply of medication throughout their lives. In Italy, 99% of deaths from Coronavirus are people who suffered pre-existing conditions. That is another way of saying that they are members of this new citizenry, dependent upon modern medicine for their day to day survival.</p>
<p>&rt;To live out their lives, they are dependent on medication. Medicine keeps their diabetes under control, reduces their cholesterol and lowers their blood pressure. They survive, but they are vulnerable. And through the birth of this new fragile citizenry, a role emerges for the epidemiologist, the man of science who is tasked with dictating the kind of social interactions and behavior that enables this brave new citizenry to withstand the spread of whatever new disease might threaten them.</p>
<p>Especially this section.  We are creating weaker and weaker people.  More and more dependent on what the BMJ has called the medical-political complex.  </p>
<p>As a recovering science nerd, I think a lot of us think too much.  Tech solutions aren't solutions at all, they just create more complex problems.  In this sense it keeps the science Ponzi scheme going.  It forces society to become smarter and smarter which sounds good at it's core but to what end?  I think we are becoming weaker and weaker and more and more dependent on things and we are losing our humanity.</p>

        <p>Well, you’d have to ask what it means to be a human? </p>
<p>Humans naturally have a drive for innovating. So, really from a retrospective point of view, this is an inevitable consequence of evolving as a human being. </p>
<p>I don’t think you’d want to be stagnated in any particular human era anyways. They all have pros and cons.</p>

        <p>I dont know.  I've lived in other countries and in places that didn't feel the need to innovate.  They didn't need to always see something new.  They were  content with life how it was.  </p>
<p>There are different ways of looking at life and I think many of us are trapped in hypercompetitive overstimulated cities.  I kind of see the banality of constantly wanting more and not being content with what we have.</p>

        <p>Hmm that’s a good point certainly. </p>
<p>Especially considering that everything is driven by consumerism, which absolutely doesn’t provide long term sustainable content-fulness.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s a good thing at all - just saying it seems to be in our nature.</p>
<p>If you search into spiral dynamics, it’s a very interesting concept on the evolution of individuals and societies on a mentality-basis - the bottom being survival instincts (the homeless for example), which there was a point in history where most of us shared this state, and the top of the spiral being divinity - a figure like Jesus Christ, Buddha, etc. </p>
<p>Materialism fits somewhere in the middle, and that’s where most humans around the world are today.</p>

<p>Right.  And we constantly need to innovate to attempt to fulfill something that we can never fulfill because we've created an addiction to new things. As you mentioned it's not sustainable for our world but that's what is emphasized.  </p>
<p>Never heard of spiral Dynamics I'll have to look into it.</p>

<p>I just saw this from CS Lewis and found it appropriate.</p>
<p>&rt;Far from being freer and better humans, these new creatures will be “weaker, not stronger: for though we may have put wonderful machines in their hands we have preordained how they are to use them.”1 As a result of sophisticated biotechnology, “Man’s conquest of Nature, if the dreams of some scientific planners are realized, means the rule of a few hundreds of men over billions upon billions of men.” Lewis concludes: “The final stage is come when Man by eugenics, by pre-natal conditioning, and by education and propaganda based on a perfect applied psychology, has obtained full control over himself. Human nature will be the last part of Nature to surrender to Man. The battle will have been won.”2</p>
