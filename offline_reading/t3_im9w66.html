    <strong>Anyone else hate the obligatory "social distancing, of course!" disclaimer when people announce their parties, or even just going out to eat with a friend?</strong>
    <p><p>I hate, hate, hate how we're made to feel shame for having fun anymore, even when it's in an otherwise "safe" setting. I've seen people organize SMALL get-togethers that would have plenty of room for natural social distancing anyway, and they always feel the need to explain how they're going to be following COVID protocols. It's like they have to preface their announcement with that in order to offset the some of the stones, like, "Please don't kill me, we're gonna be good little children about it!"</p></p>

        <p>Yep. In my organization, whenever someone says "I hung out with my friend" they go on to say "with social distancing of course". Like JFC. You can't even be within 6 ft of your own god damn friend?! I'm so sick of it.</p>

        <p>I've been telling people "It's okay, I'm not a believer."  They either get very uncomfortable (because I just came right out said what's on their minds), or they act visibly relieved.</p>
<p>The other day I walked into a convenience store late at night.  The only people there was 3 or 4 Indians.  As I approached the front door I saw that they were chatting with their masks off.  They saw me approach and rushed to put their masks on.  As I entered (without a mask) I smiled and said "It's okay guys.  The masks are bullshit.  I know it, you know it."  They took their masks back off and smiled at me.</p>

        <p>Also I’ve been trying to make eye contact to give other un-maskers (there are so few here) a silent “high five” when I see them. But now I’m going to just start giving them a big thumbs up. And/or saying “hell yeah rock and roll!” Or something similarly dorky.</p>

        <p>It would seem my friend group has adopted an unwritten law of simply not publicizing our gatherings anymore. My friends are all at different levels of risk with it but no one is really hiding out anymore or making a huge deal about it. I’ve hung out with a handful of people pretty regularly for pool parties this summer and no one mentions it. We don’t take pics anymore. We don’t check in. We just enjoy each other’s company and no one else even gets the satisfaction of knowing we’re together. </p>
<p>The people who do this kind of shit online get off on people complimenting what good little citizens they are. It’s the worst in my generation (millennial) because of the goddamn “everyone gets a trophy” complex. It feeds their seratonin when someone recognizes their compliance. I don’t mention anything covid related at all anymore. I post random memes and that’s it. No more pics of me with people, no more checking in when I take a vacation in October. Social media blackout. I’m done giving anyone the satisfaction of being able to ridicule me for not living in fear.</p>

        <p>I think In a way that’s good. Checking in was weird AF anyway. Now that I never get on social (since June) I wonder why I spent so much time showing half-strangers what I was up to and what I had on my mind. It feels incredibly eerie now. Like just a weird damned thing to do. Like making your existence a slick media product.</p>

        <p>I think (I hope) that this will be the dominant mindset among normies in the future.  The internet of the 2000s is long dead, all it is now is a surveillance, psychological warfare, and marketing tool that's aimed straight at you.  </p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if future historians viewed social media as this enormous fad that gripped society for 20 years before it faded away?  I'm ready to see what a post-social media world would look like.</p>

        <p>I like when people say things like that - it means they're idiots and I should avoid the social gathering. If y'all are stupid enough to say this crap then I don't want to hang out. I don't want to go to a socially distanced dinner get-together or socially distanced night at the pub. I'll wait until you all stop acting like morons first.</p>

        <p>My friend made an announcement for her birthday party a couple of weeks ago on FB. She put in a sentence on the bottom "P.S. Don't forgrt your masks 😉". Of course, we had all been out and had been to parties during this time before with her so I knew that was just posturing on FB.</p>
<p>We get to the party, sure enough, no masks lol.</p>

        <p>The fact is, there's a limit at which people can tolerate being told what to do.  And when it comes to things that you constantly need to remind people to do or not do, you have to wonder if it's worth it.</p>
<p>For instance: we don't need to be told not to murder people.</p>
<p>However, we constantly need to be reminded to wear masks and "social distance".</p>

        <p>I’m just curious if you’re personally in a job or school that will fire or suspend you if you went to a wedding out of state? Or to a party where the FB invite didn’t mention masks??? I know of no such profession. </p>
<p>Not trying to press you, I just wonder if half the people who are doing this.... (and many, MANY would not actually be “punished” in a meaningful way beyond a little social discomfort for like a second, but are swearing they would because they need to feel like their lack of courage is absolutely necessary for their self preservation)...and they see everyone else do the same thing, and they are doing it because YOU are doing it.</p>
<p>And god help us all - you are doing it because they are doing it. With no real punishment hanging in the balance. </p>
<p>I could be wrong. I’d love to know employers who would fire people over this. </p>
<p>This reminds of people who won’t go maskless, and claim it’s because they fear getting beaten and dragged out of the store. It’s just not true. We have to face the fact that it’s just hard and uncomfortable and takes lots of courage. It’s not actually dangerous.</p>

        <p>I don’t blame them for complying with things in order to avoid conflict/personal repercussions (especially professional). </p>
<p>I do blame people for proactively encouraging fear and embracing the new normal - as those people directly contribute to perpetuating this insanity. If someone has an irrational fear or unreasonable expectation, you hurt them by catering to it (and thereby reinforcing it). </p>
<p>Here... you aren’t going to face ANY issues 99.99% of the time for simply <em>not mentioning</em> social distancing or masks or such. </p>
<p>If someone else makes an issue of it (unlikely in most cases), then simply express surprise that you forgot to mention and say “oh of course.” No one will have a problem with that. </p>
<p>But if YOU make an issue of it by proactively advertising compliance, you’re communicating to them, “this is something right and important that I care about” ... which effectively amounts to telling <em>them</em> to care about it.</p>
<p>Edit: again, this doesn’t apply if your work will be impacted somehow - then you just do what’s best for you.</p>

        <p>I make it clear I don't follow any of this before the gathering so if the organizers have a problem and want to enforce these crappy rules, I won't go. That includes events with relatives. What's the point?</p>

        <p>Yeah, it’s cringey. More virtue signalling to add to the pile.</p>
<p>I also hate when people posting pictures of social outings feel compelled to state that they followed the rules. As a recent example, a friend posted a picture of herself hanging out in another friend’s house. She wrote: “Her house has five bedrooms, so there was plenty of room to social distance.” Do we really need to hear this?</p>

        <p>Yep, and I always skip the invitation when people pull that shit.  Because there are only two possible outcomes to an invitation for "socially distanced" hanging out:        </p>
<p>1) you're lying, you're not going to actually follow SD protocol, thereby you are a virtue signaling piece of shit.  I have no time for holier-than-thou assholes who don't practice what they preach (or preach what they practice)</p>
<p>2) you actually <em>do</em> plan on keeping a 6ft distance at all times, aren't going to want to hug or handshake, aren't going to want to ride in the same car, are going to be constantly complaining that places are too crowded, so on and so forth, in which case the hang is going to be lame as fuck.  I have better shit to do than babysit a brainwashed germaphobe who is afraid of their own "friends"</p>

        <p>One of my girlfriend's best friends had her birthday party at her place back in July- a gathering of around 15-20 people. She put in little "sanitation stations" around the house and backyard, with hand sanitizer and whatnot. She was worried for a lot of the night because so many people were over- not because she was scared of COVID, but because she was scared of having neighbors or passersby report to the police that there was a large gathering of people. Nobody at the party really cared though, we all had fun, socialized, had a potluck-style spread of food that everyone enjoyed. But I remember just feeling bad because she felt somewhat guilty for celebrating her own birthday with friends. What a bizarre world we are living in where one feels that way.</p>

        <p>So far I’ve only dealt with this once. My husbands good friend and his wife invited us over for a socially distanced visit. We were only allowed to sit on their porch and had to stay six feet from them. Couldn’t go in their house. We didn’t want to go at first but we did because we didn’t want to seem like jerks. It was kind of awkward. They haven’t been out since March and don’t even visit their family (except outside and distanced). We have taken two vacations this summer, been to lots of get togethers with family and friends. I felt bad for them honestly and their son being stuck at home all summer and not getting to play with other kids. My kids would have gone crazy if we didn’t leave the house for that long.</p>

        <p>Some of my friends posture and virtue signal on Facebook when I know they are not actually doing what they say they are. It’s pathetic frankly.</p>

        <p>I haven't been out to eat with my partner yet. I just don't feel like it will be a satisfying experience anymore and I have no idea what the state of my favorite sushi belt place is. They probably shut down the belt i would bet, which is honestly the funnest part about sushi. It's silly too, because honestly what's that even going to do? I never see people take a plate then decide they don't want it and put it back. Maybe it does happen but in my experience, no.</p>

        <p>I hate it all.  I absolutely hate it, I hate the disclaimers on maskless footage from before the circus started, and I hate the way people wear masks on camera when there's no one within 50 feet of them just to remind everyone watching to be afraid.  Pete sake, animated characters in commercials and music videos are wearing masks now!</p>
<p>But what I <em>really</em> hate is when musicians release songs with unnecessary references to masks and The Virus in them - I guess just to make clear that "I'm not advocating going out and partying <em>right now</em>, just at some undetermined later date when the authorities allow it!"  You take a great song, and you ruin it with a completely unnecessary virtue-signaling genuflection to The Narrative which will last far longer than the scamdemic itself does.</p>
