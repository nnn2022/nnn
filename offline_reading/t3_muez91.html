    <strong>Is it hypocritical?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey just another guy who wants to see things to back to normal. Luckily living in Utah things are getting pretty close. But I had some concerns about this subreddit maybe you all can help alleviate them?</p>
<p>Seems everyone on here is claiming people are fear mongering about COVID and respond by fear mongering about government control.</p>
<p>Is one fear mongering somehow better than the other or is it all just a hypocritical display of incompetence?</p></p>

        <p>The difference is, all we want in this sub is freedom of choice... my body my choice... whereas the other side is trying to impose on us...</p>
<p>Most of us here are not anti vax or even anti mask... we simply believe it should be a choice, no government should be able to exclude people from society for not having a substance injected into them.</p>

        <p>There is a legal concept called "your rights end where mine begin". It's the legal precedent for outlawing smoking in restaurants. Yes, you can smoke. But, when your smoke is inhaled by a server and harms them, you no longer have a right to smoke indoors.</p>
<p>Same thing here. You have a right to spew little droplets of your saliva when you breathe and talk. Buy, when those droplets have a high probability of entering my nose and mouth, you now have a legal obligation to stop those droplets.</p>
<p>That why we wear masks.</p>

        <p>This is the perfect explanation. I’m very glad to see this as I generally like to go around to various circlejerk places on Reddit and upvote people who have a correct belief but are being downvoted by the mouthbreathers that believe they have special rights despite never having read the Constitution and not having any real legal or scientific evidence to back up their claims...</p>

        <p>The issue is that your actions can directly or indirectly harm another’s life. If you spread a disease that leads to someone having to go to the hospital and the hospital is running out of staff to assist your with you cancer treatment or your surgery or birth of a baby, that is a public health crisis. I think that we can agree that if you need medical attention, a doctor or nurse should be available to help. At the moment, we have too many people getting sent to hospital due to complications of COVID, that manpower is stretch thin.</p>

Hope you have the same position on a woman’s choice to do whatever she wants with her body, including an abortion, I hope you don’t try to impose your beliefs, religious or otherwise, onto what they can and can’t do. That would be hypocritical and embarrassing honestly.</p>

        <p>Yes, but with that you are also saying, “I do not want to listen to the government because they do not know what is best for me.” They may not, but they may know what is best in general, such as masks. They may not be good for one or two people, but for 300 million? And some of them with compromised immune systems? And no antibodies at all? That would definitely be a yes for masks during a pandemic. This just comes down to people wanting to be noticed, and maybe those same people really believing what they believe, so they don’t obey the government and go all over the media about it. Sometimes people make the wrong, uneducated choice, and they mess up a perfectly good plan. Vaccines are the same way. They have always been mandated, not just the covid vaccine. They help you, and if you believe that there are random chemicals that hurt you, thats wrong. They are in very small amounts and cannot hurt you, unless you are allergic.</p>

        <p>Here’s a thought. If you have compromised immune system or have underlying conditions you are free to stay home. That’s what I would do. But I’m healthy and I don’t want to take a shot that hasn’t been thoroughly tested like all the other vaccines. That’s my choice. I have a 99.9% chance of surviving Covid. </p>
<p>If I don’t wear a mask and I come in contact with someone who had heath conditions who decided their freedom to go out and get a beer at a bar was more important than staying home, that’s on them. </p>
<p>Sick people quarantine. Well people don’t.</p>

        <p>Ok, fair point. But, what if there are people who go out and do things for those people with compromised immune systems, and they catch covid from other people? What do they do then if they can’t bring necessities to the people with messed up immune systems? Do they let the person starve, or do they hope that the person doesn’t catch covid? See, even if the people that have compromised immune systems don’t go out and possibly get the virus, they still have a chance when helpers go out and maybe get covid. The best we, as a people, can do to help is listen, think about how your actions affect other people, and wear masks. Stay safe</p>

        <p>Yes, they should take their own precautions. Great idea. Other people should realize that they too should wear masks not for their own safety, but for other peoples' safety.</p>
<p>You know what? I hate masks, and I hate wearing them. But, I wear them because I know that there are other people who need to have masks and other people to wear masks so they can stay safe and others stay safe.</p>

        <p>I see your point, but when does "My body my choice" start becoming a societal issue? Because it <em>isn't</em> just your body. We're not talking about getting a tattoo or a piercing, we're talking about something that can affect the people around you - people who, for one reason or another, aren't able to get the vaccine themselves. </p>
<p>I get that you can't force people to be helpful, but what if everyone had that kind of attitude? If people in important professions decided "We're not going to help this guy because it's our body and therefore our choice." I get it's not quite the same because, say, a medical professional would've decided on a career that focuses on helping others, but again, if enough people have this mentality the number of medical professionals will start to drop. And what's more, in this case, we're not talking about years of education just to serve the public for even more years in high-stake stressful situations, we're talking about getting a vaccine. </p>
<p>To me, this isn't a case of what <em>I</em> want. This is a case of me being able to help others by doing very little. Same with donating blood. Or giving to charity. You can choose not to do any of those either, but can we really function as a society if everyone has that attitude?</p>

        <p>Well, herd immunity depends on the disease. I'm sure what the numbers are for Covid-19, but I know for polio the threshold is about 80%, meaning that 1 in 5 can avoid getting the vaccine. But that doesn't mean 1 in 5 gets a "free pass", those 1 in 5 should be saved for the people who can't safely get the vaccine. </p>
<p>But I don't think we can divide the world up into "can" and "can't"s. We won't ever reach 0% crime, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have laws and law enforcement. We can't save everyone, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have hospitals or send ambulances out to people who had, say, cardiac arrest, even though the statistics show that a large percentage of those people will die or suffer brain damage regardless of the ambulance. </p>
<p>I don't think it's a case of having your cake and eating it too, to me it's about the effort of trying to see the nuances of grey instead of prematurely giving up because the odds are against you.</p>

        <p>if not having said substance makes you a risk to the rest of society, then 100% the society should not want you involved. </p>
<p>Thats not weird, thats not wanting your choice to not take a vaccine effect the health and safety of the rest of the people. </p>
<p>Just like if you don't pay your taxes, you shouldn't reap the benefits of tax funded systems. If you don't make the choice to protect those around you by getting a vaccine, then you are also making the choice to step away from society because you are a risk.</p>
<p>Society doesn't want you nearby because you have made selfish choices, don't cry that the government are taking too much control because you cant be both selfish and a part of the collective...</p>
<p>Societies are literally built in order to improve the livlihood and safety of the members, if you are choosing not to vaccinate then you are a risk to the community and those taking the precautions have every right to exclude you from it. Thats not taking your choice away, the choice is still there, your choice just no longer effects the community in a way in which would be taking our choice to take precautions away.</p>

        <p>If masks and social distancing is still in place even with vaccinated individuals, then wouldn’t it not matter whether someone was vaccinated or not? Secondly. And more importantly. You can still spread it with the vaccine. You can still catch it. </p>
<p>You will see. This vaccine is going to create an actual deadly virus the likes of which you’ve never seen before. Resistant strains will become stronger meanwhile you’ll be pressured to get booster shot after booster shot month after month. When all we had to do was go about life, let it run its course like the flu, and be on with it.</p>

        <p>Nothing of what i said contradicts any of your 'Counterpoints' nor does your reply contradict the simple facts i shared.</p>
<ol>
<li>we have booster shots and yearly vaccinations for the Flu. 2. The Flu would be subject to becoming worse as you have said too but it's also become evidently less dangerous than when we first discovered influenza.</li>
<li>I won't be pressured, because i will take the yearly vaccination for covid the same way i take my vaccination for the Flu and the original vaccine for covid- without a bitch and a moan, in my arm and continue on with my life completely unnaffected but now able to hug my family again without fear of infecting them. Living in England has been a blessing, we have very little anti-vax misinformation and it has done wonders for us. </li>
</ol>
<p>My main gripe is with this subreddit in general assuming that exluding unvaccinated people is a totalitarian move and the governments are out of control - They are not, they are implementing measures that keep the majority safe. If you choose not to get vaccinated then that is an active choice to step away from society because you are a risk. You can't eat your cake and have it too.</p>
<p>Likewise with masks - masks have been proven to slow the spread of disease. The evidence mounted during this pandemic only logically points to the need for face masks in more general settings outside of red alert pandemic situations but in no way says it needs to be a long term mandatory wear. Right now we are still in the height of Covid, going to the shops should have us masked up without question, its common decency to those around us vaccinated or not. Once the virus settles (Like every other virus we have dealt with has with more research and time) then we can start shopping without masks and save mask use for when someone actually has an illness but needs to continue about their business.</p>
<p>If you are refusing to mask up or vaccinate because of your basic human right to choose what you do, then you will be refused access to society because of everyone else's basic human right to a healtheir environment, and the same right to choice as you had to yours.</p>

        <p>My point is why get vaccinated. You say it’s to hug your family again, and live a normal life, yet you can still transmit the virus apparently. You can still catch it. So how is that protecting anyone including yourself? That is my question.</p>
<p>Masks do not work. Mask mandates lifted in states here have had decreasing numbers of covid, while their reporting is proven to be even more scrutinized now. The adverse effects of masks outweigh the potential for stopping transmission. The problem is no one wants to read scientific findings about it because it goes against the main narrative. That isn’t science. That’s an agenda.</p>

        <p>Mask mandates do work as far as i have researched, plenty of crosstalks from both sides but the majority of scientists and independent research groups have stuck their necks out to show a large reduction in transmission.</p>
<p>Whilst vaccinated you CAN still pass it on, but it's more like how a condom is only 99% effective, yet catches prevents pretty much all pregnancies.</p>
<p>Vaccinations reduce the likelihood of you passing it on dramatically, so i can hug my family knowing im basically safe from passing it on AND that they are now less at risk if i do somehow manage to infect them because they are vaccinated.</p>
<p>If you would like proof of vaccinations working, look at the UKs stats. Our pandemic is basically over because of how well we have distributed vaccines, there is so much misinformation out there but you can't bullshit nationwide results.</p>

        <p>Could you clarify? seems like a bit of an immature response. Would be rather concerning to see someone so fragile that they proposition a fight when they have realised the flaws in their thought process. But then i may have misread your tone and text is unforgiving like that.</p>

        <p>I didn't propose shit. I asked you if you were willing to fight me over it, as you are the one wanting to force me out of society. And I suppose the answer is 'no'. So I guess your arrogance is impotent. You won't make me do shit. I will not wear masks and I will never take the vaccine. Better accept it.</p>
<p>All these internet hero's constantly talking tough shit about isolating people from society but won't actually do shit in real life. I'll just continue to live my life as I have always done.</p>

        <p>I edited my original comment to just request clarification rather than include the rest of my point upfront, but you confirmed that i had the correct assumption. So here is the response.</p>
<p>"On the off chance that it was simply a question of would i stand up for what i believe in - I'm not keen on starting a fight, no. i've seen enough action in my time to know I'm not interested in starting unnessacery fights and will avoid them for as long as i can converse instead, but i more than know how to handle myself and I would fight anyone threatening the safety of myself or my peers for their own selfish gain without hesitation.</p>
<p>TL;DR:</p>
<p>I would not be the one to engage in violence for an issue like this, seeing as its built out of missunderstanding and an inability to reach mutual understanding, that could be solved via better communication rather than Ape violence, but i would fight you for it if you forced me to, yes."</p>
<p>However you have then assumed that because i was not instantly ready to hop on your 'totally not real' proposition with a straight yes that i would not fight. It's really odd thinking.</p>
<p>This is the sort of mindset that will get your ass beaten when you attempt to start the fight with someone that has enough experience in fighting to know its not the choice you want to take. </p>
<p>All i can assume from this is that you equate someones intellectual and logical integrity with whether or not they are willing to take a swing - that's doesn't paint you in the most intelligent light.</p>
<p>I'd love to have seen you debate with Stephen Hawkins, I'm sure curbstomping a bloke in a wheelchair would have changed the reality that you are living in too</p>

        <p>That's the thing, I wasn't the one forcing anyone, you are the one that came up with the idea of booting people from society. Which I consider a violent act.</p>
<p>Edit: @ your edit, bro I am not the one that wants to fight, reading comprehension please. What the fuck do you think your plan will entale? Laws are made to keep us from society and we just roll over and accept being pariahs? No. We will not stop living our lives and being free, so what then? Are you going to force us with violence?</p>

        <p>then that right there is one of the misunderstandings i was talking about, and doubles down on why i was so confused that you brought up fighting at all.</p>
<p>You wouldn't be booted, you would be dissallowed access to community provided services and shunned from the community. Police won't come to support you when you need it, Ambulances won't rush to you when you struggle to breathe and bars clubs and restraunts won't allow you access to their services because you are a risk to every one else using the services.</p>
<p>You aren't being booted out, you are just being left out. Why should we sacrifice our time, safety or tax funds for you in these ways when you are unwilling to make a tiny sacrifice to your pride for us?</p>

        <p>Again, you advocated for violence by wanting to exclude certain people from society. How do you think that's going to be enforced? Don't be naive. You are advocating for the violent removal of covid pariahs from society. And if you didn't realize that would somehow have to be enforced, you're extremely naive. Ofcourse you aren't going to be the one doing the enforcing, you let that dirty work to police and politicians. My grandpa survived a labor camp, I will never accept anything possibly happening like that ever again.</p>

        <p>I'm really, really not, it would be enforced by denying access. AKA the ambulance doesnt even turn up. You can then walk to the hospital and attempt to force yourself access, but then that would be you instigating the violence, not me. Please stop running us in circles.</p>
<p>If you start getting violent because you have been denied access somewhere then you will be forcefully denied access instead, which can include violence true, but that violence would be in self defence because YOU are attempting to force entry to somewhere that, via your own choices, lead you to be ineligible for entry.</p>
<p>The right to deny you access is also the same right that allows you to deny a vaccine and a mask. Your choice will have consequences in the form of NON VIOLENT disclusion that you would need to esculate in to violence.</p>
<p>That would be YOU choosing to instigate the violence, your option of getting vaccinated and joining the rest of us inside the community is still always an option that you are choosing not to take because your ego has made you believe you know better than the rest of us. You would also be physically putting those in the place you are attempting to gain access to at risk of disease, so any violence you cause in trying to forcefully gain access would be twice as eligible for the self defence argument.</p>
<p>In all scenario's that i am advocating for, violence is not needed. Violence would be the choice made by those  on your end of this arguement.</p>

        <p>Considering the weirdo has blocked me so i can not directly reply to his wild accusations, his comment is:

<p>How have you managed to get this so backwards? I am jewish for a start mate, your need to believe all those that disagree with your world view are completely far right dictators has lead you to a weird hill to die on.</p>
<p>If my (jewish) community members were walking disease risks then i would very much be telling them not to go in to shops, and would refuse service if its my choice to do so, yes.</p>
<p>Thats not fascism, Its common fucking sense mate. Your ego-driven, self-involved mindset deciding you are being opressed because people arent going to let you just walk in to their premises whilst being a risk to their life is honestly really concerningly opressive in and of itself. Why do we have to justify not wanting your diseased self around us? Do your fucking part and we wont have issues.</p>

        <p>In the US, at least, we recently had a presidential election with one very pro-mask, pro-restrictions, etc. candidate and another less pro-mask, anti-restrictions candidate. </p>
<p>The pro-restriction candidate won the popular vote.</p>

<p>In response to your comment:<br>
This would mean the majority of people (voters) are not <strong>so</strong> opposed to the "lockdown" that ending it is a priority.</p>
<p>This may not be the same as "agreeing" with it, but is indicative of the level of tolerance for COVID procedures, policy, etc.</p>

        <p>Great questions! Variables matter a LOT with transmitting like communities that are close knit vs. spread out population, popular traveling destinations vs. home cities, the state enforced safety mandates and down time in between lockdowns, income level/age/race/political party/etc. That affects how quickly and easily it’s spread, who is getting together and who is wearing masks, who is staying in the state, etc. Again, it’s a lot of variables. </p>
<p>Second, Texas is doing well for a couple reasons. The people who got vaccines, had previously immunity from having Covid, the warm weather which means more people outside vs inside gathering, etc. The rise of vaccines is great but in places where that ain’t happening enough, we might see more surges. Including Texas.</p>

<p>A lot of retirement communities and nursing homes required stricter mask/distancing/visitation mandates than the rest of the state. A lot of old people weren’t exposed to covid because of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who pick up cases in Florida and go home don’t get counted as Florida covid cases. If they tested positive at home in Michigan, they’re a Michigan case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diverse population means some communities interact less with others meaning less transmission. And some communities taking it more seriously than others. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many low income people don’t get access to testing or treatment so they don’t get counted by the state. And many many people got sick.</p>

<p>And again, variables. We’re still learning about this disease. Maybe the climate in Florida makes it harder to spread who knows</p>

        <p>This says it wants to extend abortions to 24 weeks, risk of death, or infant incompatible with life in addition to taking abortion out of the criminal code meaning you would not be charged with murder of an infant in crimes against pregnant women. It says nothing about extending abortions to 9 months except when there is no viability or risk of death. And for the record I’m actually against this bill as well</p>

This crazy pro-masker got mad at me out of nowhere as I was taking my seat, just for coughing in her baby's face. "Stop coughing on my baby! What the fuck!" I was so angry, I started screaming bible verses at her for a solid ten minutes, asking her how she thought it would be ok to infringe on my rights like that. Then Jesus came and aborted the baby and everyone clapped. He handed me the sequel to the Bible, you can read all about it in r/BibleConspiracy. I have schizophrenia. :-/</p>

        <p>People who get to 8 months pregnant and have an abortion aren’t just realizing “ah fuck, I’m pegert, gotta abort!”</p>
<p>It’s people who want their child but most often the fetus is either already dead, brain dead, or has conditions like anencephaly or other severe deformities where they’ll die after birth.</p>
<p>Late term abortion is basically just induced stillbirth and it’s sad as fuck, it’s not someone killing the baby they’re almost to term with because they decided randomly they don’t want it. It’s love for their child if they choose not to let their child be born only to suffer, or their baby is even already dead and that person knows it.</p>

<p>&rt;The significant drop can be explained by the introduction of face masks in elderly and nursing homes</p>
<p>So they masked non healthy, non vulnerable people.</p>
<p>&rt;Concerning the effect of masks on community transmissions, the survey needs to rely on pre–COVID-19 studies.</p>
<p>This study looks at one specific place at a specific time (April 2020 early in pandemic when we were being shown videos of people dying in the street). It mentions, but does not account for other regions, measures put in place or the psychological / behaviorial effects of seeing masked individuals (increase distance without mandate).</p>

        <p>But you can see people. You can play sports, as long as it's not with too many people, that is. You can go to restaurants. You can attend gatherings.</p>
<p>This isn't anything to do with Nazi Germany, because there is no oppression. You're saying this right now, aren't you?</p>

        <p>I am in the UK so no,</p>
<p>The issues I have are:</p>
<p>Why force everyone to be vaccinated and not just the vulnerable?
The statistics and science have shown that over 99% of the population survive Covid-19 perfectly fine.
Why? Because their own immune systems naturally produce the antibodies requires to kill the virus.</p>
<p>So for the vast majority of the world a vaccine is unnecessary...
Why can't we just vaccinate the tiny vulnerable population and let everyone else carry on as normal? This way everyone will be producing the required antibodies for protection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the vaccines were safe and effective, then why do the vaccinated population receive no benefits from taking the injection?
They currently still have to wear masks and social distance etc etc they can do nothing differently from the unvaccinated... surely if they worked this would not be the case.</p>
<p>In light of all this - does the whole thing not seem incredibly suspicious?</p>
<p>Now the absolute worst part of the entire thing so far...</p>
<p>Vaccine Passports: - Why?!?!?! </p>
<p>As has already been established in my earlier point, there is no need for the majority of the population to get the vaccine... as we will produce antibodies naturally...
So why would they force us to be injected with a substance if we want to take part in normal society?</p>
<p>Is that not the epitome of Tyranny?
&rt; get injected with this substance or you cannot go here or do that?
&rt; today it is Covid-19 but tomorrow something different, whatever they want
&rt; we will have no freedoms, not even over our own bodies?</p>
<p>-do you not see how dangerous of a weapon this is against the people?</p>

        <p>The death rate from COVID is low <em>when medical care is available</em>. If we had seen hospitals across the country being overwhelmed with patients then the death rate would have been way higher because many people would have received no treatment. This is what “flatten the curve” was all about.</p>

        <p>Every person that gets the virus allows it to mutate slightly as it passes from person to person. The Kent variation caused the huge spike over Christmas and we're seeing more and more variants coming out around the world. The Indian variation is reported to be affecting younger people. </p>
<p>If the virus is just allowed to infect people unchecked we are going to end up facing a serious deadly variation. It doesn't seem suspicious in the slightest, just plain common sense.</p>

        <p>I take your point, but the variants we have seen here (UK) such as the Kent variant has been far more infectious, spreading very rapidly. There's been some debate as to whether it was more deadly, but it put far more people in hospital than the original first wave. We're hearing of the South African, Indian and Brazilian variants now and so far.</p>

        <p>Dear god you are from the UK, please tell me you are a lone crackpot with these ideas because they are devoid of merit and any scientific reasoning....</p>
<p>If you are going to quote statistics and claim scientific credence then provide peer reviewed journal articles to substantiate your claims or quieten down!</p>
<p>Your immune system does not recognise a viron it has never been exposed to before, so it tries a random antibody on the virus when that fails it tries another. It keeps going until it finds one that works and then mass produces it. This takes time, in this time your body reacts to the viral infection. This reaction can kill or leave your body so weak you need support to survive. </p>
<p>While it is true the majority of people dying from this are elderly or other underlying health conditions it is not all people, add on to this that an infection can have lasting health damage (long Covid) if from an asymptomatic infection and you have future burdens on the health service being generated from people who seemingly are fine from an infection.</p>
<p>Lastly you have the viral reservoir issue; that larger the number of being hosting the virus the greater than chance of a mutation, mutations are dangerous as they can lead to more infectious or dangerous strains.</p>
<p>So you vaccinate everyone to protect everyone, from long Covid, from mutations and from the smaller possibilities of death and life changing illness.</p>
<p>For full vaccination to be completed you need two doses plus 3-4 weeks. This does not provide 100% immunity because vaccines do not work like that, but reduces the likelihood of serious illness. So you carry on with the rest of the rules because the number of fully vaccinated in this country is a small fraction of the population. When they are fully vaccinated then they will carry on with the rules to reassure other people. People do what they see other people doing.</p>
<p>Vaccine passports have not come in to being and are hotly debated still, this is a speculate point. All your other points are twaddle and have no basis. Ironically I am with you on this; we should not have them. Everyone should be in the same boat until we have this resolved.</p>

        <p>I’m just going to address a few of your points, since I don’t particularly feel like writing an essay at the moment; </p>
<p>One of the reasons everyone needs to be vaccinated is because there are some vulnerable people whose medical conditions prevent them from being able to take the vaccine. The best way to protect them is to vaccinate everyone else. There’s also the fact that we don’t even yet know the full repercussions of contracting and surviving covid. People have gotten permanent scarring in their lungs, brain impairment, and a whole host of other issues they’ll have to deal with for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>While it’s true that we generate antibodies on our own, that takes time, and it’s better to have them before COVID enters your system, that way you can fight it off before it reaches your lungs and causes real damage. Vaccines work by injecting into your immune system something that looks like the virus, so that your body can prepare in advance. Sure you can build a bomb shelter while the barrage is underway, but isn’t it better to be warned and prepare ahead of time?</p>
<p>On your point about masks; the covid vaccines all prevent you from becoming seriously ill or hospitalized, but have varying degrees of effectiveness at keeping you completely asymptomatic. Even if you are asymptomatic or have very few symptoms, you still carry the virus, and can still give it to others. masks don’t protect you. They prevent you from passing covid on to others, and if everyone wears them, nobody will spread it. That’s why people care so much that everyone wears masks. It’s not like seatbelts. </p>
<p>These are just a few things I wanted to point out.  Hopefully I answered a few of your questions. Feel free to disagree of course, not much I can do about that.</p>

<li>No one is responsible for anyone elses health. I have a disability before you accuse me of not understanding, I'd NEVER expect everyone else to undergo medical procedures to supposedly protect me.</li>
<li>Swine flu has been linked to causing narcolepsy, which destroys people's lives and there is no cure. Every illness causes permanent damage to the body to some degree, it would only be a small population of patients where this is even a concern. I'd argue narcolepsy is worse than scarring on the lungs, where was the lockdown for that?</li>
<li>The chance of you dying of covid and the chance of being vaccine damaged are near identical, I would rather contract covid as at least nurses have experience dealing with covid, which they don't when it comes to vaccine reactions that they're taught don't exist.</li>
<li>You're acting like this 'vaccine' isn't completely questionable, the vaccine companies have done basically nothing to assuage the public, only demanded they use their experimental product.</li>
<li>Masks don't work. Even if they did, the sides of a mask would produce a jet of escaped air that will spread the virus even further, ever notice your glasses steam up when wearing one? It's like thinking flushing the toilet with the lid down is more hygienic: it's the worst thing you can do as you create a jet of toilet water. Not to mention how you keep touching the mask and rubbing your nose spreading it more easily, then with disposal and pollution... Do you hate turtles or something?
Thank you for your thought out reply, again this is just my opinion, I'm not attacking you.</li>

<p>Water droplets that carry the virus is what the mask catches. So it has nothing to do with air. Everything about this can be tested, and has.</p>
<p>&rt;Not to mention how you keep touching the mask and rubbing your nose spreading it more easily,</p>
<p>Heard of hand sanitizer or washing your hands? </p>
<p>&rt;It's like thinking flushing the toilet with the lid down is more hygienic</p>
<p>That's a bit different. Your spit is not equivalent to fecal matter. Bacteria can be in the mask, but that's why you wash it. It doesn't grow instantly.</p>
<p>&rt;then with disposal and pollution... Do you hate turtles or something?</p>
<p>There are reusable masks.</p>

<p>I didnt say disposable masks weren't a problem. However considering that the majority of pollution comes elsewhere, the masks are insignificant in comparison. People leaving them on the ground are stupid, no question about that.</p>

<p>As well, with your water droplet points, studies have just recently been coming out (I'll see if I can find them after work) that the droplet transmission is not a significant factor, and that covid is spread the aerosol transmission.</p>

<p>That's not really the masks fault, more of the people not using them correctly or them going around touching things.</p>
<p>For example if Im in a store and I pass by or am standing by someone, wearing a mask will help.</p>
<p>If I go to the store and touch things unnecessarily without clean hands, I will be spreading my germs around, regardless of the mask.</p>
<p>It's like wearing a helmet and then thinking you can jump off a cliff.</p>
<p>&rt;and that covid is spread the aerosol transmission.</p>
<p>Sorry, water droplets and aerosol, both are what the mask catches.</p>

<p>That is true, however I would like to add that the changes were about the effectiveness of the masks against the virus. Masks have been used in the medical field for decades to prevent spreading bacteria.</p>
<p>Changing the recommendations isn't a bad thing, I agree with all that you have said. Changing the recommendations is a good thing, it shows that we have gained more knowledge on the subject.</p>
<p>Her mockery of ScIEnCe is very much an assumption that nothing in science changes. There are plenty of variants in things we know that we can find out more about.</p>
<p>&rt;Unfortunately, water droplets and aerosol transmission are not caught to the same degree by masks. What is defined as surgical masks by the FDA do not in fact, seem to make any claim to stop aerosol transmission as far as I can read:</p>
<p>Ill try and see what I can find.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn't block aerosol droplets, it would slow them down enough to where they fall after a few feet. Hence the 6 ft.</p>
<p>I will add that we do know that the aerosol droplets that carry the virus are heavy enough to fall to the ground. They did a study (idk if I will be able to find it again but I will try) and the only way for aerosol droplets to carry the virus over long distances was if they were light enough, but they could only get aerosol droplets small enough to do so artificially. The aerosol droplets that naturally occur from you are too large to go airborne completely.</p>

<p>About 60% of people who recovered from covid experience long terms symptoms like residual cough, fatigue, sometimes blood clotting. So not just fine. Over 3 million people have died from COVID 19 and not just old/immune compromised people. For reference, 300,000-650,000 people die of the flu every year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more the virus spreads, the more it mutates. Like the flu. That’s why we have a new flu shot every year. So if people don’t get vaccinated and wear masks, we keep spreading diseases that mutate requiring everyone to get vaccinated every year. It puts vulnerable folk at risk every time they come into contact with a mutated strain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is still the possibility of catching and spreading the virus even after being vaccinated. But most importantly, businesses don’t know who is vaccinated and who isn’t so the rules apply to everyone until they start requiring vaccination cards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Normal freedoms do not apply when it comes to life and death. Even George Washington required the entire US Army to get vaccinated against Smallpox</p>

<p>It’s not mutating to become more deadly so it’s almost the same virus each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That possibility is extremely low. Asymptomatic people already spread it less than symptomatic people and the vaccine reduces that further</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt; Data analysis in a study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Pfizer Inc found the Pfizer vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech reduces infection, including in asymptomatic cases, by 89.4% and in syptomatic cases by 93.7%.</p>

        <p>Capital GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Just say pandemic mate, you don't need to include global.
The more the virus spreads the more it mutates, correct. It mutates into a much weaker version of its previous self. 
Freedoms are freedoms. If you restrict them in anyway them.they weren't really, were they?</p>
<p>And tell one time 100% of a population got vaccinated? That's bonkers talk and just not feasible for anything to work</p>

        <p>You’re right, pandemic means global. Just trying to emphasize a point. It doesn’t necessarily mutate weaker, the new South African variant of the coronavirus is supposed to be even more deadly for example. And you’re right! I don’t think vaccines should be a freedom. I think it should be mandatory, with medical exception. And obviously we’ll never get 100% of people to agree but we need 70-75% majority in order to get back to normal</p>

        <p>Nope that was just an example. It could be 0.15%, it could be 10%, the point is that 99.85% of infected people are not going to die of Covid. If you even get the very small portion of most at risk people vaccinated you drop the death rate significantly. </p>
<p>For example in Canada the people over 60 years old make up 97% of the deaths. Vaccinating everyone over 60 would theoretically lower the death rate by 97%. And those people don’t nearly make up 70-75% of the population</p>

        <p>The hospitalisation % is far higher, which needs to be taken into consideration to ensure health services are not overwhelmed which would in turn lead to more excess deaths. </p>
<p>The hospitalisation numbers are more important when you look at excess deaths instead of just direct deaths form Covid. Taking these numbers in to account, people who could not get treatment due to the number of Covid cases in the accessibly health system, which resulted in their deaths should not be overlooked. </p>
<p>So looking at the pure death rate of Covid is misleading when talking about policy decisions on protecting a population. </p>
<p>Personally; I would prefer to take a vaccine with a ~0.002%(?) chance of a blood clot than risk a viral infection of the same or less chance that could kill or maim me. Then I am more likely to have a crash on the way to the vaccination place anyway.</p>
<p>Added bonus I can't hurt anyone with the vaccination nor by accidentally spreading the virus to someone more vulnerable</p>

        <p>Excess deaths are about the same as Covid recorded deaths (around 500k in the US according to CDC), and I’m not against the vaccine. I don’t think it should be forced but I think it’s a good option for those who want it. My point is just that we don’t need 75% vaccinated to return to normal</p>

        <p>You are quoting the lowest number you can there.</p>
<p>Total excess deaths across the United States 63,036-163,309.</p>
<p>Look at the same dashboard (god I hate tableau) for weekly number of excess deaths over the last 5 year period and you can see 2020 was far larger due to Covid. </p>
<p>Look at total number above average by cause and you can see over 100k deaths.</p>
<p>Going back to excess deaths with and without Covid, if you look at the data points you see that the is not always data behind them, if you want to truly determine the number you also need to offset the decrease in other forms of death from the baseline (reduction in automotive deaths (&amp; possibly gun?) Due to lockdowns etc moving the excess number artificially downwards.</p>
<p>Either way, the US will not be an exception to the modelling in western economies for Covid and non Covid excess deaths.</p>

        <p>That’s a good point, I’m sure some people died of Covid that weren’t considered excess as deaths were lower in other areas. But deaths also raised in other areas too. I don’t know the US stats but I know here in Canada deaths by drug overdose rose last year for example. Also if everyone who tests positive for a Covid test is counted as a Covid death, that inflates the numbers quite a bit as well</p>

        <p>Typhoid is easier to avoid than COVID. Typhoid has a lower fatality rate. Typhoid has actual proven successful treatments. Typhoid is a bacteria whereas COVID is a virus. So, no, they aren’t the same, and COVID has done way worse things than typhoid. </p>
<p>I work with healthcare workers, and it is pretty frustrating watching how hard they have to work, how stressed out they get and the shit they have to put up with because idiots are entirely uneducated about what is happening and have decided for themselves that it is a hoax or an overreaction. So you can spout off whatever crap you want, but I am definitely going to believe the people I have known for 20+ years who are facing this every day.</p>

        <p>Typhoid has identified, proven to be successful treatments. That is the point. And it is more difficult to spread. Your argument is entirely idiotic. And fatality rates range between 1-4%. 
It is hilarious that you actually think you have a solid grasp on this based on, like, 40 minutes of research on Google, pulling up the first articles you find. The reason I think COVID is more dangerous is because I work for a research institute with doctors, nurses, clinicians, epidemiologists and more who have spent their entire adult lives dedicated to learning about stuff like this and trying to solve medical issues. Our colleagues in the institute for infectious disease tell us this is a serious issue. They have a whole lot of actual scientific support for their findings. So when they tell me something is an issue, I believe them. But I am glad that you feel you know more and are better equipped to educate people about it.</p>

<p>No, I am actually from a 3rd world country where typhoid has been a problem at some point in the recent past. I know these things because I have actually studies them. Even if I had only spent 40 min, it doesn't negate the fact that those peer-reviewed articles PROVE that I am not being deceptive. If you have better information, please do not hesitate to provide it. I am open to discussion if you have facts. Ad hominems have no currency here.</p>

        <p>Dude.. you have provided exceptionally low quality “evidence” to support your position. These studies were mostly done more than a year ago as well and came out months after COVID really hit.. meaning there has been time to follow up on them and for successful treatment to become widespread. But it hasn’t. Why hasn’t it? Because the results weren’t reproduced because it didn’t work. For someone who claims to be a scientist, you seem to know very little about science. I sure hope you’re not the only person teaching those Masters and PhD students, because they are in a lot of trouble if you are.</p>

        <p>in this analogy, you’re wearing a seatbelt to save yourself. with a mask, its not just to protect yourself, but also to increase the safety of people around you. the reason it is mandated is because the choice not to protect other people in a community is not only selfish, but reckless, and carries deep consequence. of you do not wish to be a part of a community i recommend heading out into the woods to live alone where your personal choices won’t harm anyone else - as it should be.</p>

        <p>It doesn't block you breathing. Hundreds of years of using masks, tens of thousands of studies on it, millions of people globally wearing masks (sometimes multiple at a time) for upwards of 14 hours a day all prove without any shadow of a doubt that masks are safe and do not, in any way, restrict your breathing.</p>

<p>Why are you pretending not to understand that the virus particles are contained in the saliva aerosol that is reduced by the mask?</p>

        <p>You clearly don't even know how a mask works. Virus are kind of charged, masks take advantage of that and also have a static charge on them which attracts the virus to the fibres in the mask. Watch minutephysics' video on how masks work.</p>

        <p>You have no idea about how masks work. Your trachea is a couple million times bigger than the virus, so how does it get caught on it? Masks work in a similar manner, by catching the droplets in which the virus could get transferred.</p>

        <p>... The point of the mask is to catch the droplets that you exhale that contain the virus. Do me a favor, exhale on a window and tell me if you see condensation. Now put on an n95 mask and do the same. You should see little to none.</p>
<p>That's the point of the mask. The actual virus itself doesn't float through the air. It is carried in "water" (spit) droplets. The mask limits the amount of these droplets thst you spread.</p>

        <p>In all seriousness, what are your thoughts on the comment below? What do you think when someone responds with the comment that the virus itself is that small, yes, but it cannot presently move without being attached to <em>something</em>....which at present is primarily by water droplets, spread when people sneeze/cough. Genuinely interested in your thoughts...what do you think about mask use for that purpose?</p>

        <p>Lol dude your purposeful obtuseness is embarrassing. Nah I don't wear mine 24/7 but the point is I shouldn't have to wear something that goes over my mouth or nose because its not fucking natural. Maybe from where you're from you're used to seeing people for a total of 5 minutes cause your debilitating fear cripples you from social interactions, but when I go out I like to socialize and shit.</p>
<p>Edit: man people got <em>triggered</em> by this comment. And to the smart ass who asked how I walk around this stupid, I'll tell you this: maskless, healthy, and still alive! Enjoy that harmless piece of cloth for the rest of your life tho!</p>

        <p>Literally just a peice of cloth yet you're acting like it will somehow make you more stupid than you already are. Why do you wear a raincoat when it rains? It's not natural at all. Wearing a mask doesnt affect your ability to socialize unless you like to stare directly into their mouths.</p>

        <p>The thing is, if we had dealt with the pandemic properly there would be a risk of a "new normal" all of the people who refused a proper lock down and precautions are the reason we are on year 2 of this. The same people complaining about masks are also the reason that we still need them. Luckily, with the vaccines we should be finishing this dumb shit soon, so in the end thank the scientists for ending what we could have ended ourselves.</p>

        <p>Isn’t everything that happens fated to happen , and therefore natural?  Maybe planets such as ours are fated to spawn life that will eventually reach out past it’s orbit. This is just a shower thought I’m having an in no way contributes to conversation you guys are having. I thought you made a good point. As for me, wearing a mask has had about as little impact on my life as having to wear pants when I leave the house.</p>

        <p>That’s one perspective. Words limit the meaning of what I’m trying to say. We could be fated to make things happen. In fact, just forget the get the word fate. Empty it out of your head. Think seed in the ground, plant grows, fruit forms. Planets born. Conditions ripe for life. Life evolves to leave planet. It’s not really worth debating.</p>

        <p>Tell me mate, do you wear shoes? A shirt? Socks? Cause I don't think those are "fucking natural" but you still wear them. Also masks don't restrict your breathing. I have lung damage and breathe just fine with it on. If I can do it you can too.</p>

        <p>Been wearing a mask for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for over a year now. Doesn't stop me breathing at all. In fact, the only negative thing it does is make me a bit warmer when I'm doing physical work with it on. It also doesn't stop me from socializing at all. It's not like it glues your lips shut.</p>
<p>The fact that you don't realise the irony of saying someone has a debilitating fear, while also you yourself being fearful of a piece of fabric over your mouth shows how dense you are. Man up.</p>

<p>&rt;Maybe from where you're from you're used to seeing people for a total of 5 minutes cause your debilitating fear cripples you from social interactions,</p>
<p>Lol, taking precautions is not fear. Im not afraid of covid, just like I'm not afraid of car wrecks. There's a difference between taking precautions and being scared in a hole.</p>

        <p>People wear masks all the time for various jobs. It’s never been a problem. Stop using a bullshit excuse and just admit that you’re either too lazy to spend two seconds putting on a mask in social areas, or you just want to be “cool” for your anti-mask friends. That’s all it is. None of this “government control” garbage.</p>

        <p>You wont wear cloth over your mouth because its “not natural.”</p>
<p>Okay, Karen.</p>
<p>Is your shirt natural? How about those pants?  You wear those out of necessity, why draw the line at a mask?  I bet your ass you’d let a company choke you out with a tie if it meant a good job.  Just admit you are afraid.</p>

        <p>Funny how “debilitating fear” is a go to for y’all. You think people who wear masks, quarantine, and remain socially distant, as recommended by the cdc, are “debilitating afraid” yet here you are on a subreddit devoted to fear. Fear over some “new normal” which you lack the self-awareness to realize is your own invention</p>

        <p>... Now that's just an outright lie.</p>
<p>I'm a theatre nurse (theatre as in an operating theatre) and there has always been a requirement to wear masks during surgery. Because the alternative would be spilling spit droplets into a person's open body while talking or breathing.</p>

        <p>No, not all in the operating room are required to. I wasn’t thinking of just the surgeons.  <br>
Anesthesiologists for example. And the requirement is probably different depending on your country.</p>

        <p>If your country doesn't require masks for surgery, I'd not get surgery there because you'll probably get an infection and die. All western nations mandate them due to them cutting the risk of infection dramatically.</p>
<p>This is settled science, and has been for over 100 years. At this point you have to be extremely stupid to be anti mask, as in unable to tie your own shoes because you're unaware that shoes even exist despite them being on your feet level stupid</p>

        <p>You're trying to use logic with zealots. That doesn't work. They already live in fairy land you can't logic a path they'll follow. They don't give a shit what science says they care about what Kevin on Facebook shared from some scientist he can't actually reference said. Have a logic argument with any other zealot, religious, sports, guns, etc... it's futile to go with logic that sits in front of their faces. They don't give a shit that nearly 600k Americans died, Kevin told them that's a lie and that's what the government wants you to think. I applaud your accuracy but you're not going to convince them of the truth.</p>

At least I give more shit about myself than other people, because other people never gave a shit about me in the past. I owe none of you anything and there’s nothing warped with that. You’ve been brainwashed into thinking that people who ARE selfish like this are assholes and killing everyone.

<p>My local grocery store has online ordering with curbside pick-up. I'm not required to wear a mask during this process. You should see if establishments near you have a similar program.</p>

        <p>It’s not a joke, it’s more expensive because delivery charge and you have to tip them. Don’t be condescending, I would know because I’ve worked for nearly all the delivery services and deliver groceries to people too afraid to go to the grocery store themselves</p>

        <p>You're not understanding.<br>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/rc5NnM9">This is what I'm referring to.</a></p>
<p>There are 4 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Curbside pick-up : Free  </li>
<li>Delivery (store to door) : $9.95  </li>
<li>Delivery (warehouse to door) : Free  </li>
<li>In-store pick-up : Free</li>
</ol>
<p>Only #2 costs extra and <em>may</em> be expected to tip (don't know, never did this).</p>
<p>I was doing option 1 even before the pandemic. It's just convenient after a long day at work to just pull your car up, they load your groceries, and then you drive home.</p>
<p>Edit: multiple stores did this pre-pandemic, I'm sure even more are doing it now.</p>

        <p>Ok first of all, there are laws that allow businesses to refuse service to people not wearing masks. The gay couple can’t change who they are but anyone can wear a mask. One scenario involves a person being refused service because of the owner’s religious beliefs, and the other is someone being refused service because they were too lazy to wear a mask like everyone else in the store. It is completely within your power to change and wear a mask, whereas that is not the case with the gay couple</p>

        <p>Just because something isn’t genetic doesn’t mean they can change it, or that it isn’t determined at birth. There may not be a “gay gene” but a persons upbringing and childhood can influence their sexual orientation. Either way, that’s part of who they are. Unlike your fear of masks. That can be changed. It’s a hell of a lot easier for you to wear a mask than it is for someone to change their sexual orientation. That being said, it’s completely ridiculous to compare these two scenarios. Requiring masks in stores is no different than asking customers to wear shirts and shoes and pants when they enter. It’s a matter of human decency, but I’m sure that’s a new concept for you.</p>

        <p>I absolutely believe that it's about the upbringing and related experiences - particularly sexual trauma. Just like a child can be taught to be a career thief, they can get the help they need to unlearn those things. If they learned a certain habit, they can unlearn it...and it's by choice. Tough choices are made by brave people. It's always easier to play the role of the hapless victim than it is to be courageous.</p>

<p>&rt;When did you make that choice and why, what was the appeal of choosing that sexuality before you changed your mind?</p>
<p>Science! Anal sex is 20X more risky for HIV than vaginal sex. Gay/bisexual men are responsible for more than 50% of all HIV cases in the West despite being \~2% of the population. They also account for a disproportionate representation in herpes, syphilis and gonorrhoea. Why be a human petri dish if something else is available?  </p>
<p>&rt;Why do you think the overwhelming majority of people can't choose their sexuality?</p>
<p>Everyone can choose, which is why perfectly straight people engage in homosexual activities during long stints in prison, and revert to heterosexuality once they get out. People have the ability to choose but they have been brainwashed into thinking that "they were born this way" when Kinsey knew from the 1950s and 60s that sexual orientation had a scale. At least people are coming round to the idea that sexual orientation is fluid... which shows that it's not immutable because of genetics.</p>

<p>You know you can be gay and not have anal sex lol</p>
<p>But if you can consciously decide to find vaginas arousing they're certainly better than sticking to mouths and hands lol</p>
<p>But this is interesting, it wasn't actually related to religion at all? But rather a practical consideration of the negatives of anal sex?</p>
<p>&rt;Everyone can choose</p>
<p>Nope, I can't choose to find the same sex attractive, there are only a small handful of people who claim they can.</p>
<p>&rt;which is why perfectly straight people engage in homosexual activities during long stints in prison, and revert to heterosexuality once they get out. </p>
<p>Being driven by desperation doesn't exactly sound like a concious decision, and considering this doesn't happen with every man (and is largely an American phenomenon) it suggests they had latent same sex attraction beforehand.</p>
<p>&rt;People have the ability to choose but they have been brainwashed into thinking that "they were born this way" when Kinsey knew from the 1950s and 60s that sexual orientation had a scale.</p>
<p>The scale means most people aren't 100% straight or gay, not that it's a choice lol</p>

        <p>Are you able to turn yourself gay by choice? Your evidence is shit, because it doesn't prove that being gay is a choice, it just proves that it isn't genetic. A lot of human traits aren't genetic and yet the person that has them can't change them.</p>

        <p>Psychopathy has often been considered untreatable. Its unique characteristics makes it among the most refractory of personality disorders, a class of mental illnesses that are already traditionally considered difficult to treat.[146][147] People afflicted with psychopathy are generally unmotivated to seek treatment for their condition, and can be uncooperative in therapy.[130][146] Attempts to treat psychopathy with the current tools available to psychiatry have been disappointing. Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that there is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as yet, no pharmacological therapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of psychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more adept at the manipulation and deception of others and be more likely to commit crime.</p>

        <p>There is no point in keeping this up if you are gonna take things out of context. </p>
<p>Right after that bit you decided to use as "evidence" there is this part: </p>
<p>Attempts to treat psychopathy with the current tools available to psychiatry have been disappointing. Harris and Rice's Handbook of Psychopathy says that there is currently little evidence for a cure or effective treatment for psychopathy; as yet, no pharmacological therapies are known to or have been trialed for alleviating the emotional, interpersonal and moral deficits of psychopathy, and patients with psychopathy who undergo psychotherapy might gain the skills to become more adept at the manipulation and deception of others and be more likely to commit crime.</p>
<p>Meaning that is no known way yet to treat it, and even worse, those who do undergo psychotherapy have a chance to become more deceptice and likely to commit crimes.</p>
<p>Either way, becoming a psychopath isn't a choice, just like being gay, or straight isn't a choice. </p>
<p>Here let me try and give you another perspective that might make it clearer, assuming you have a hobby or a passion, did you choose to enjoy that certain hobby? Think about it, you don't choose what you like, you just find out you like something or someone and act accordingly.</p>

<p>&rt; Influenza cases went down 98.5% in the US. Influenza, like C19, is a respiratory infection caused by the passing of infectious airborne droplets. If the same measures used for C19 caused a 98.5% drop in influenza cases, why are C19 cases continuing to rise in the US?

        <p>What I don’t understand is why people are ok with 3 million dying though, when there are ways to lessen this? It’s the deflection argument, the one that truly means absolutely nothing. One person is upset that 3 million people died from covid, so the other says well that’s less than the flu, or cancer or whatever the argument is that day. That’s the part that frustrates me is that it’s compared to everything else, and not just seen as terrible? Doesn’t matter if more people die from something else, if my wearing a mask has the potential to save even one life from covid I could never argue against that. I don’t think I could live with the guilt of knowing I passed covid to someone and they died as a result, if wearing a mask had a chance to change that.</p>

        <p>You <em>really</em>  don't see the correlation between flu deaths and covid-19 deaths? <em>really</em>? a virus that is closely related to the flu?</p>
<p>I suppose you also wouldn't see the fact that those who are healthy, and not immunocompromised/elderly have a roughly 99% survival rate. Saying you could have prevented them from dieing is like saying if you hadn't decided to drive a car, maybe you wouldn't have been involved in a car accident.</p>

<p>Edit: for those down voting corona virus is a SARS-COVID family while the flu is part of the influenza virus family. They are different families all together. They even look different, having different receptors and such.</p>

        <p>The CDC estimated 22,000 flu deaths in the US in the 2020 flu season, which was lessened mostly due to the social distancing and mask wearing due to covid. My comment was not to say that there are no similarities between the flu and covid, but that the argument always seems to go “covid killed 3 million people, we should do something” and someone responds with “just as many people (or more) die from the flu (or car accidents, or cancer etc.)” Yes that statement could be true, but the problem is that it does nothing to stop or lessen 3 million deaths! It is a deflection argument, but doesn’t actually address the problem</p>

<p>&rt;!Hint: If your answer is either "C19 is caused by a novel virus" or "The virus that causes C19 is more infectious" I will be thoroughly disappointed because it shows that you don't understand that infectiousness is completely unrelated to the size of air droplets which masks are allegedly meant to prevent.!&lt;</p>

        <p>Because C19 is much more infectious and can be carried asymptomatically much more so. In addition to lockdowns, social distancing and masks causing a huge reduction of the flu, people with the flu will likely stay home when they are sick as they are likely to have symptoms. C19 can spread silently and quickly, but each person is different.</p>
<p>Why this sub think they are "woke" and know better than leading virologists and scientists over the world is beyond me. Nobody wanted this. None of us enjoy it. We arent calling for "restrticting your freedoms" or wanting you to wear a mask so we can all have a big laugh. People are dying in numbers never seen by the flu. It's like 6x the amount the worst numbers flu has done in a year in the US, and that's WITH the lockdowns and masks and distancing. Even if you assume the flu cases were lumped in, which they werent, it's still 5x. Others have gotten permanent damage to their lungs. This isnt a flu.</p>
<p>I dont know what it is. Maybe everyone in here just doesnt like being told what to do, ever. Maybe your vacation was cancelled and you took it personally? But the delusions in here are real and you guys are literally trying to justify it with a mini echo chamber and cherry picking rare data that suits your rhetoric. Its madness. Chill the fuck out and wear a piece of cloth over your mouth so it doesnt increase infection rates. The fact that this is even a complaint is childish. Literally like a 5 year old throwing a tantrum for not having things exactly they way they want. This is why it's a mandate and not a choice. Too many immature people who cant make the proper decision to do it on their own.</p>

<p>I don't get this error in logic: how does the infectiousness (ie, how quickly something spread) have to do with how well you are masked, how many times you wash your hands and how socially distanced you are? If it's still spreading like wildfire despite these measures and being of the same size as influenza and common colds, then the methods don't work. </p>
<p>Asymptomatic spread is extremely rare and this study had 10M participants:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">Post-lockdown SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening in nearly ten million residents of Wuhan, China | Nature Communications</a> </p>

<p>Yawn! I have already explained the difference between IFR and CFR and am amazed that you still make this mistake 16 months into this PaNdEmIc!

        <p>Capitalism is the reason so many people are on or below the poverty line. And when did I ever mention communism?</p>
<p>I don’t have a perfect other idea, but you can’t deny that capitalism as it is now is a problem.  The best we can do (and frankly it’s a joke that it isn’t happening right now) is tax the rich, deprivatize the prisons, universal healthcare in the US, and Universal Basic Incomes. I guarantee you that with those, people wouldn’t have been starving or on the brink of getting evicted right now.</p>

        <p>Yes, capitalism is what dragged billions of people into abject poverty around the world. Communism is what made the USSR, N Korea, post-colonial Africa, Cuba and pre-WTO China into bastions of economic growth and prosperity. Thank-you for correcting my understanding of world history!</p>
<p>What we have now is NOT capitalism: it's post-capitalistic cronyism. In a capitalistic society, losers don't get bailed out - they are allowed to fail. In a capitalistic system, you don't have super PACs and revolving doors between industry and regulators. I assume that I am talking to a Bernie Bro, but do you think that the rich will stick around to be taxed? The reason that there are so many prisons is because the law is broken: fix the law, get the petty non-violent criminals out and you'll see the problem resolve itself. Not sure that you understand how UBI works but unless the money is backed by goods and services, the currency in which the UBI is disbursed won't be able to buy much. </p>
<p>I have much to say about the US healthcare system: the biggest problems are the bureaucracy, the highly concentrated health insurance sector and the unholy alliance between price-gouging Big Pharma, the medical professionals and health insurance. The US is also ridiculously unhealthy - imagine a country where &rt;80% of the pop is overweight! Someone has to pay for that and it's either you - through higher taxes or you - through higher healthcare costs. </p>
<p>Capitalism didn't cause the eviction and poverty damaging the US today: most of it is attributed to the INSANE response to C19.</p>

Fortunately Covid is a very slight risk to the vast majority of us.  The restrictions on the other hand affected almost all of us, negatively.  And there was a very strong chance that my mother was going to die soon, and alone, because we weren't <em>allowed</em> to visit her, but you don't seem to care about anything that isn't Covid.

<p>What?  I am considering my mother, and all of her family; we weren't allowed to visit her, even if we wore a mask and temperature check etc.  Under no circumstances were we allowed to visit her.  We could have worn masks, socially distanced, wore medical grade uniforms if necessary, and visited her alone in her solitary room, but we were not allowed to do that.  It is just <strong>so</strong> selfish of you to not care about that, and only care about the <em>very</em> small percentage of people who have died from your disease du jour.</p>

        <p>Wrong again, I said:  "The restrictions on the other hand affected almost all of us, negatively" which you <em>completely ignored</em> showing your narcissism.  Again, all you care about is one single issue, a disease that over 99.96% of us have survived after over a year.  You don't care about any one suffering otherwise.  Damn bro, you are selfish.</p>

        <p>Did anyone ask the people in nursing homes what they wanted?  I would bet that most of them wouldn’t choose to be locked up in a jail with no visits from family.  Even people in prison get visits under normal circumstances.  What has happened to elders in nursing homes violates the Geneva Convention.  It is literally torture.  Which would be fine if they were ASKED what their wishes were, which they were not.  Oh, and by the way, the ones that got sick were infected by staff.  No visits from family, but staff made people sick and everyone is fine with that.  I find that unbelievable.</p>
<p>I have lost two aunts in the last year.  One from cancer and she had to die alone, and one from the dreaded virus.  She obviously had to die alone.  Just think how terrible that is, just picture it.  If you can’t, you have lived a privileged life and have no right to lecture others.</p>

        <p>So you'd happily go into a care home where the most vulnerable are and risk infecting your parent and possibly the whole home, the most vulnerable from the disease? If you'd infected her she'd probably die very soon, along with a good number of the other residents. It sucks, big time, but looking after her and her friends should be more important to you.</p>
<p>And what most people overlook is that every person who is infected acts as incubator for the virus as it slowly mutates - we're starting to see some nasty variants developing around the world that could set everything back again. Get your jab, wear a mask, donate to charities helping third world countries vaccinate and we'll see an end to this.</p>

        <p>I would have happily gone into a care home to visit my dying mother who <em>did</em> die very soon, but she wasn't allowed to see her family.  I/we would have worn a mask, had our temperature taken, kept our distance.... pretty much <em>anything</em> to visit our old and confused mother.  If you have a problem with putting the "most vulnerable" at risk, then take it up with the idiot governors like Cuomo and Newsome and other who <strong>forced</strong> nursing homes to accept C-19 positive patients.</p>
<p>&rt; nasty variants </p>
<p>You fucking clown.  If you don't see the sham by now then you <strong>are</strong> a clown.  It used to be 'don't overwhelm the hospitals'... then President Trump provided military hospital ships Comfort and Mercy, and field hospitals too.  Then they said 'never mind to that, we need ventilators', so President Trump provided those.  Those also went unused.</p>
<p>......... sheesh......... just the fact that you would suggest me going to visit my dying mother is somehow wrong......... just Fuck You.  You get a jab, you wear a mask, and you go fuck yourself.</p>

        <p>The main issue is that both the infection and mortality rates are grossly inflated. </p>
<p>It is estimated that somewhere between 2% and 10% of positive results from the test have been accurate. This has been reported by the media recently, so I assume that you have seen this?</p>
<p>However, the inaccuracy of the tests has been known since last year. Everybody who gets a positive result in these inaccurate tests is counted in the infection rates. </p>
<p>As for the death rates, this gets inflated as they count anybody who dies within 28 days as a COVID-19 death, regardless of the cause of death. I personally know two people who committed suicide because they received a positive test result and both of them were reported as having died from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Aside from inflating the death counts, the mortality rate is also not flat between different age groups. The majority of the people who died were 60+. Additionally, most of these people had pre-existing conditions and actually died of their pre-existing condition rather than COVID-19.</p>
<p>The key to surviving this disease is having a healthy immune system.</p>
<p>This information has been known for over a year, yet the charade about this being an extremely deadly virus that kills healthy young people continues.</p>

<p>Science, is not a religion and doesn't need anyone to believe it. The onus is on the ExPeRt to PROVE what they THINK is true using the best-available information at that moment in time. Stop making science a cult!!!<br>
I cannot wait for you to start using DDT and smoking because "you believe the science."</p>

        <p>Smoking has been known to be hazardous for nearly a century now and DDT has been banned in the U.S. for half a century......due to science.  Using 50 year old facts as a gottcha attempt to discredit science is well beyond ignorant.  Science is very much predicated on the fact that it is not perfect. Continually trying to improve is kind of the point.</p>

        <p>Well with what we know now about covid,  we can tell it's fearmongering about fake fears. However,  with what the govt is doing now,  there are some valid fears the govt is going to take away more liberties. Look at the Michigan post just before this one,  or how people routinely said no,  there won't be vaccine passports last year but the msm and certain govts are trying to push them</p>

        <p>Fear mongering - the action of deliberately arousing public fear or alarm about a particular issue</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with fear mongering. For example a hurricane is coming to hit Florida. The news talks about it non stop for days. Everyone should be well prepared by the time it hits or will have gotten out of the state. Fear Mongering isn’t a bad thing. What bad is using lies to fear monger. </p>
<p>More importantly though stop using the word everyone. I have never once talked about fear mongering on this sub until this comment.</p>

        <p>I can see what you’re saying. Many of us here are afraid and fear things that haven’t happened yet. However, we make these claims based on history repeating itself. It’s scary to think about. I hope the things we “predict” in regards to social credit scores, vaccine passports, and tyranny don’t come true. It’s just hard to not talk about when that’s becoming a reality in other parts of the world</p>

        <p>No it is not. Most people don't comply in fear of a virus. They comply, because they fear the government and police. This is just another invisible doomsday threat theory that the media is pushing. Im sure if the media pushing cases and deaths of every other viruses and  diseases around the world before the covid every day nobody would ever leave their houses. They would be injecting every drug the government on pharmacy companies would sell them "in their best intrest".</p>

        <p>Probably, idk just seeing what people knew about any yearly illnesses that effected significantly less people this year with the mask mandate in effect? I'm curious since many in countries I've been to it's normal and expected to wear a mask if you have any flu like symptoms and have to go out in public.</p>
<p>I used to get a bad cough every year but I didn't  get sick at all during my 4 years in Japan. As soon as I got back to the US, I started getting sick every year. At least until this past year I haven't been sick. I understand there are many other reasons that this could be the case but I also don't see a reason why I should discredit the masks neither. </p>
<p>There are people that emotionally or physically can't wear masks and I understand that but the idea  with the masks isn't to completely stop it, but to lower the chances of the disease to spread.  More people wear them, infection rate goes down.  Even if the masks don't help slow the spread of covid, it does help the spread of other diseases. Why choose this to complain about when masks aren't noticably effecting ones breathing? Surely there are better things to fight and complain about.</p>

        <p>Can't people just put up some restrictions to stop the pandemic?</p>
<p>I mean if all people wore masks and got vaccines, then the virus will go away sooner or later.</p>
<p>If we don't do anything the virus may be here forever.</p>

        <p>Pretty much everyone here is just angry that they’re being told what to do. They claim that the virus is a hoax after doing some “research” and then accuse the government of somehow planning the pandemic...blah blah blah. And they use the classic “I have my rights” argument. Wearing a mask doesn’t take your rights away. It just protects other people from getting the virus. It’s really not a big deal to wear one but people on this subreddit have a tantrum for some reason. And then they try to scare people who wear masks by saying they’re being manipulated, while also saying they shouldn’t give in to fear. So you’re right. it’s all very hypocritical.</p>
