    <strong>Reasoning in times of Covid</strong>
    <p><p>I was one of those that was early to the party. Before most people, I knew all about the spike protein and itâ€™s damaging effect. I realised the vaccine side effects were enormous and many victims were falling anonymously, but in great numbers. </p>
<p>I actually thought those two things - once they seeped into our consciousness - would put a stop to the mass vaccination campaign. How naive I was. </p>
<p>It turns out you canâ€™t reason with people after their amygdala has been flooded with fear and propaganda. Itâ€™s as if once frightened, any confirmation of that fear is grabbed like a life raft and held on to for dear life. 
The more objective and often more comforting truth is treated with disbelief, to the point of aggression. </p>
<p>Weâ€™ve all experienced this, Iâ€™m sure.</p>
<p>If someone understands the spike protein causes vascular damage on its own, then the one blogpost that contradicts this is found and all other studies or official documents are dispelled. Even if they are more recent.
Show them a peer-reviewed study from Nature or The Lancet - which by their own account is the highest of the high - and suddenly the science published there is wack. 
Show them a vaccine injury victim and it is fake news, or exceedingly rare, or there was some medical issue that caused this weird looking drug addict to slide into convulsions. Probably just withdrawalâ€¦</p>
<p>All reasoning and more shockingly, all their humanity is gone. You care about your 90 year old vaccinated grandma but not about a 35 year old mom who canâ€™t function anymore? Okâ€¦</p>
<p>Iâ€™m at the point where I understand that reasoning and evidence simply will not cut it. Iâ€™ve learnt to stop looking for confirmation from my family and friends, which I didnâ€™t realize I did until now, and stand in my own power. 
Still love and want to protect them, but in a way that is far more unconditional and free. Like, you wanna jump off that cliff? Go ahead, and Iâ€™ll love you anyway. </p>
<p>The only thing we can do is vibrate at the highest possible frequency, dance hug sing and laugh, keep our life happy and light, stay grateful, and accept that people will get hurt or die. Even people we love. 
Everyone chooses their own destiny. Those who will not hear it will need to crash into that wall hard before they grow. And as illustrated above, it will take a hard crash to break them out of their spell. That is not our responsibility. 
This time it wonâ€™t be a half-done job. All of societyâ€™s ugliness is surfacing, and will need to be addressed. Until the last one wakes up, weâ€™ll be stuck in some version of this nightmare. Might as well get comfortable and dance in the rain until the storm is over. </p>
<p>It is a sad but freeing truth. </p>
<p>Stand strong ðŸ’›</p></p>

        <p>A great little post, which is not only well written but also poignantly heartfelt. What is quite interesting is that this situation is reflective of our societies and how they have functioned for many years. At least the last 40 years where access to the TV, media and programming has been more prevalent.</p>
<p>Would this psyop have even been possible without all the tools in the armoury? Smart phones, social media, 24 hour news, celebrity endorsement culture, global censorship, government lockstep, non disclosure contracts, over weighted public service sector employment? The answer is obviously no. </p>
<p>So I think we have to ask ourselves the question, if they needed all this stuff to pull off this crisis, were the foundations deliberately introduced in order to achieve these aims. If so, how long has this been in the pipeline? And if this is the case, with the massive undertaking that has obviously been in the making for many years, what on earth is the long term purpose of this. Order out of chaos?</p>

        <p>This was a lovely post, I can relate to so much of what you have said here. Besides being in a slave world and forced into permanent vaccine stupidity, my greatest worry is losing people I care about. I try to be calm about it and pray that people don't have any long-term damage from these injections. That will be the best possible outcome. I don't want to think about the worst, I've lost many people in my life and I just don't want to go through that again anytime soon.</p>
<p>I've said this here before but the  main problems are that we have no power, the people all over the world have no power. Those that do have the power are altering reality and calling it THE SCIENCEâ„¢</p>
<p>We have seen experts saying that maiming side effects from the vaccine are normal. There's no talk of treatments anymore at all. Even if you're the founder of the treatment you're kicked off of social media and called a crackpot and silenced as misinformation. If you don't get on board with this vaccine passport you're a science denying white supremacist conservative bigot.</p>
<p>Science is not science it's a socio-political controller now, we are not in a paradigm of Truth and honesty. The depth of this is much deeper than its presented. We're in extremely dangerous territory.</p>
<p>Dems want to stop misinformation by censoring our personal text messages, there are places where people are not allowed to congregate because it will spread misinformation about the vaccines, if we don't have any ability to talk about it what power do we have? </p>
<p>If truth is silenced and reality is bent to fit someone else's agenda and truth, and actual truth has no value then you have no weapon to fight with. It might seem alarmist to others but it's not.</p>
<p>Maybe some of the deaths on the vaers site could be coincidence, but we deserve clarification. Enough of this bullshit saying fuck you there are no side-effects get it or you're not allowed back into society. People are waving away all of those vaccine related deaths but why we are meant to let the coronavirus death toll stand? And that's knowing how notoriously inaccurate the PCR test is and the fact that coronavirus was listed as a cause of death for people who died from other things and that is known as well? It's just all too much.</p>
<p>If they can force us to take a vaccine like this and threaten us with preventing us from working, School, providing for our families, then they're going to be able to do whatever they please. We are not in a world of good ethics or truth anymore.</p>

<p>Perfectly summed, and this has been true forever.</p>

        <p>Well said, and yes they know that fear makes people compliant and obedient.  Itâ€™s also good for ratings with people glued to their 24 hr news watching a ticking death count.  What sense did it make last summer when hospitals were told anyone suspected of having Covid could be classified as a Covid death (and receive a higher reimbursement rate)?  Fear.  The left, who traditionally have been hawks against gov and business abuses have been turned to be advocates for and sometimes demanding these abuses.  And they canâ€™t even see it because their fear has blinded them to it.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Iâ€™m so disappointed in the politicisation of this issue and how far along people will go with it. Iâ€™ve had many conversations with intelligent, great people where Iâ€™ve said â€˜thatâ€™s politics, it has nothing to do with scienceâ€™. 
But they canâ€™t snap out of it. </p>
<p>Iâ€™ve posted a personal friend who is in the ICU with myocarditis and a neurological disorder after vax on Facebook and itâ€™s mainly deafening silence. These are all liberal â€˜caringâ€™ reasonable people. I guess they canâ€™t argue with that but also canâ€™t bring themselves to send supportâ€¦
Thatâ€™s what I mean in my post, the time of bargaining and providing information is kind of over. Iâ€™ll give it to those who want to know or ask for it. I wonâ€™t stop saying what needs to be said or doing a bit of misinformation slaying now and then. But itâ€™s really not much use. 
All it does is drive people away, and then â€˜theyâ€™ win as well. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s all about sort of letting go of that feeling that you have all the responsibility on your shoulders and understanding that everyone has their own â€˜karmaâ€™. All you can do is try to live in truth and love - which of course will win in the end, and which â€˜theyâ€™ are trying to break. Hence the lockdown rules and why you canâ€™t have any fun, canâ€™t dance, canâ€™t hug, canâ€™t get together with friends. </p>
<p>Do that which they donâ€™t want, which is live in joy and love and not in fear, and thatâ€™s an important small battle you can win every day. </p>
<p>(And now I should follow my own advice haha)</p>
