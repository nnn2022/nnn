    <strong>Planning a trip to Calgary/Banff to celebrate reopening</strong>
    <p><p>My girlfriend and I are planning on visiting Alberta for the first time from July 1st to July 7th, when Alberta will be moving into stage 3 with all restrictions removed. We were excited to go somewhere where people act normally, but we've learned that Calgary will still have a mask mandate during this period until at least July 5th. Since we want to have a good time, we're interested in hearing from anybody in Calgary that can let us know about good restaurants or other establishments we can patronize that won't force us to wear masks. Here in Toronto, saying you have a medical exemption usually means people will just leave you alone - is it similar in Alberta? I read on the Calgary government website that you will need to provide proof in the form of a doctor's note, is this really the case? We'd both prefer to support businesses that are resisting the current state of affairs. We'd also like to go rock climbing, seeing as gyms in Ontario are still closed, if anyone has any information on good gyms in the area. Thanks in advance for the help!</p></p>
