    <strong>Putting the Covid Death Numbers in Perspective</strong>
    <p><p>The purpose of this post is simply to put numbers into context, and to consider their relevance in terms of public policy and the overall societal view of and response to Covid.</p>
<p>Let us accept that 500,000 people in the United States have died from Covid.  I know this is very controversial as there is a lot of evidence to suggest this number is greatly exaggerated.  But let's just go ahead and accept it.  That's a big number - 500,000.  But what does it mean as a percentage of the population?  Most recent estimates are that there are currently about 330 million (330,000,000) people in the United States.  If we accept that 500,000 people have died from Covid over the past year, that means that 500,000/ 330,000,000 people in the US died from Covid this past year.  Which equals 0.15% of the population.</p>
<p>Yes you read that correctly.  If we accept the worst-case scenario for Covid deaths in this country over the past year, it means that 0.15% of the population has died.  Put another way, if the Covid death rate were to continue indefinitely at the rate it did over the past year, it would take NEARLY 7 YEARS for ONE SINGLE PERCENT of the population to die from Covid.  Now obviously we know that that wouldn't even be expected to happen because pandemics burn out, and well over 1 in 7 people in the population have already had Covid, but those are just the raw worst-case scenario numbers.</p>
<p>Consider this for a minute.  The "Black Plague" occurred from somewhere around 1346-1353 AD (ie lasted around 7 years though some estimates say less).  If that entire plague had killed only 1% of the population over that entire 7 year span, do you think it would even be in the history books?  Do you think you would even learn about it?  And yet that is Covid, at it's very worst possible.  Absolute worst-case scenario is 1% of the population in nearly 7 years.  0.15% in one year.</p>
<p>Now of course we'll get the emotional arguments.  "What if it was your Grandma"? etc etc.  But I'm just providing numbers.  Don't get me wrong - any death is, in a sense, tragic.  However we seem to have completely forgotten as a society that the human death rate has always been, and will always be, 100%.  You are going to die.  Everyone you know is going to die.  Period.  It is simply a question of how and when.</p>
<p>The ultimate question then is, does a disease that kills 0.15% of the population per year (whether you're locked down or not because the rate is no higher in FL or SD), merit a response that destroys millions of livelihoods, sets children - especially vulnerable ones - back years in their development and education, and turns society on its head?  This is the question that needs to be asked.  </p>
<p>And don't forget, the average American believes that 9% of the population has died.  Show them the numbers.  I'll bet if many of your doomer friends discovered that the rate is actually 0.15%, they'd be pretty shocked.  I'll bet many of you reading will be shocked to realize this as well.</p>
<p>Final question.  If you're someone who is still in the camp that it IS worth shutting down society for something with a death rate of 0.15% of the population per year, then I'd like to ask sincerely where you think the line should be drawn?  0.15%?  0.10%?  0.05%?  0.01%?  0.001%?  0% and the expectation death fully ceases to exist?</p></p>

        <p>The recipe for this particular epidemic is no different than any other.  1 part same diseases that have always been around.  Add a generous amounts of a deadly treatment to inflate deaths.  Quadruple ordinary levels of propaganda focusing on death related to this disease.  Attach financial incentives to cases and deaths.  Profit</p>

        <p>totally agree and ive been using that logic on people to great effect.  i put it 1/1000 average age of 82 died, and i’m not ok with shutting things down for a year for that, i’m just not.   there are going to be so many negative societal side effects for this shit, that at worst is like 10% of yearly deaths, many of which were people who already had a high likelihood of not making it many more months or years due to complicated morbid conditions.</p>
