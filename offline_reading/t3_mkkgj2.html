    <strong>Some advice for confrontations with doomers...even police</strong>
    <p><p>If you ever find yourself in a confrontation with a doomer, whatever they might be doing.... reciting faucis new bible verse or asking you to put on a mask. remember the best possible option is too just smile and walk away. </p>
<p>getting involved in that argument will bring you down to their vibration and has a possibility to affect you after. </p>
<p>i have noticed after watching many rebel news videos on youtube that the police like to just monopolise their thoughts onto you without question and they do this with the power of the law.... its crazy right.... an officer can arrest you for not agreeing with them... crazy world. </p>
<p>anyway, just remember to be happy above anything else. your own thoughts are valid and real and hold truth to whatever level you see fit. </p>
<p>so stay strong, stay happy, stay winning, stay breathing fresh air not mask air.</p></p>

        <p>Yes, I've discovered the same, just walk away, it's SO not worth engaging. I have however bought police grade mace for my wife and I. She works in DC and the amount of men that confront her about not wearing a mask OUTSIDE is infuriating. I'd rather she have a knife, but DC is so fucking crazy she would prob. End up getting arrested for defending herself ðŸ™„</p>
