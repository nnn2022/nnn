    <strong>I hate how it's everywhere</strong>
    <p><p>There's the masks, the mainstream bs, the virtual school, people dying without loved ones present, women giving birth without the support they'd have had just two years ago. All in the name of this new flu that I can't bear to see the name of anymore. Whether you're in fear or you see the bigger picture, it's an assault on the mind. Life out of lockdown is not a reward, it's a right. I mentioned to the guy I love how frightening it was to see people fall in line so quickly, and he said "well, it was do or die at one point". It was never do or die, and before this mess he seemed like the type to question all the bs. I didn't get into it, I didn't want to argue. </p>
<p>I'm so sad and tired. These psychopaths have shown their true sadism and people call it "concern".</p></p>

        <p>Welcome to the club. Thankfully my spouse agreed with me and was so well-researched. He got me through the darkest days with these bs restrictions and lockdowns. Not thankfully, he passed away in February (not of COVID) and now I feel like I’m fighting a battle by myself. It must suck when your SO doesn’t see the same way you do on such important topics.</p>

        <p>I think one of the most sickening aspects of this genocide is that it's cloaked in self-righteous good intentions. Was this really the endgame of decades of dumbed down education and popular entertainment? So that we'd happily cheer on our own extermination? It sure seems like it.</p>

        <p>I can't speak for heavily populated areas but living in Alberta has been bizarre. Our numbers have been laughably low since this whole thing started last March - we are not even a blip on the radar. 2000 total deaths and only 300 or so people hospitalized across an entire province of 4.5 <em>million</em> people. We are not even a blip on the radar - up here the memes have become reality and it really <em>is</em> just a case of it affecting old people or fat people.</p>
<p>This has <em>still</em> caused people to be overly paranoid and at each other's throats for not following protocol.</p>
<p>It's almost like once the first few months passed and our region was relatively fine, people got caught up in the sunk cost fallacy aspect and <em>wanted</em> it to be worse than it was.</p>
<p>It almost reminds me of the cult around Star Citizen, where there's so little of a game after all this time, that people on the various forums and subs just blatantly make up features they think will be in the game later on down the line, and then get massively fucking asspained when someone comes along and says <em>"actually bud, none of this is even going to remotely happen."</em></p>

<p>EXACTLY THIS!!! </p>
<p>So many "compassionate" people just <em>desperate</em> for the numbers to jump in Texas and Florida so they can be right about a fake virus. </p>
<p>They'd rather this all be real just so they can feel warm in their virtue signaling. They are, by any measure, absolutely rotten inside.</p>

        <p>I am a Brit but live in California and I think it’s been a similar situation for me. California is  a huge state but I live in a remote hi desert community that has virtually no covid but sadly we get thrown under the umbrella that is California. It’s decimated our community up here. We had very little to start with so closures of businesses etc can have a catastrophic effect. I love movies and pre covid me and my friend went once a week to my local movie theater up here. Not since a year though. If our little local theater closes it will be a 100 mile round trip just to see a movie! I get angry. Really angry. I haven’t been able to go to my library for a year. One of my absolute favorite things to do. So I hear you. I have a very good friend who is an American but moved to BC a few yrs ago. He has been traveling around the US visiting friends for like 5 months not wanting to go back as he doesn’t want to quarantine!!  I think he now regrets moving as he said it’s insane where he lives!</p>

        <p>Alberta bro, very liberal on most aspects, 100% agree.</p>
<p>At the beginning, covid was an unknown so lockdown made sense until we could study it more</p>
<p>We studied it more and found that it's... really not that dangerous unless you're already a very unhealthy human being. People don't want to admit that MAYBE they could have been wrong so they keep doubling down.</p>
<p>Every time a 92 year old dies from it here it's this huge fucking concern but a 92 year old will fucking die from the common cold.</p>
<p>At this point everyone I know or have met in person knows it's a farce, it's just online echo chambers filled with losers who have to get their self worth from championing their slacktivism who pretend we should be locking down again. The people who've never left their house to begin with.</p>

        <p>hi, I’m new here, but yeah this has been my takeaway too. the left should feel utterly embarrassed about the part they’ve played in this. just complete lack of vision and backbone when the rubber finally meets the road. just trying to explain to nominal leftists that, like, pfizer is bad actually and they have never had your best interests at heart....it’s just baffling. they’ve just been worked so completely.</p>

I think that we're going to have to deal with this for the rest of our lives. First it was the Trump outrage cycle, then Covid, then the summer riots. People will need to learn to tune out lunatics for their own sanity because there is no other way out.</p>

        <p>“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”</p>

        <p>Exactly the same in Turkey. I hate it. Everyone has accepted this slavery system. It is compulsory to wear a mask outdoors. I can't properly breathe with those goddamn masks blocking my nose. Schools are closed. My little cousin hasn't been in school for a year. Online education system can kiss my butt. When someone you love dies(even if not from corona) you can't attend their funerals because of those damn social distancing rules.</p>
<p>My mom is extremely paranoid and believes whatever the TV shows. That's why we always argue. She got the vaccine but it wasn't enough to overcome her fears. Some of my friends were depressed because they lost their job after covid-19 measures. Nobody thinks about them. All they say is, "don't let grandmothers die".</p>

        <p>My father had to be in the hospital. My mother and brother “weren’t allowed inside” my brother went to where they throw out the trash and offered cigs to the cleaning crew. Got inside with a nurses kit on. Then let my mother in a fire door and they saw him. Obviously a bit hysterical but people shouldn’t be put in awful situations in hospitals with covid as a excuse.</p>

        <p>A year ago my boyfriend was saying "nothing's gonna happen" no pandemic here." Another one of his famous lines was "oh well, if I die I die." That really pissed me off that he wasn't believing me or taking it seriously.  I was preparing for the worst. After only a week after talking about it he was like "I don't wanna hear about it  anymore!" Now he's buying into to it somewhat and I'm the one who doesn't want to be reminded of it constantly. I guess I shouldn't say he's buying into it. It just seems like he's nuetral. Both of us are sort of on the same page with masks &amp; vaccines. But I'm more active in voicing my frustrations, when he only deals with the mask thing when we are actually in public. I take the anger &amp; frustration home with me.  I don't know how people don't carry resentment. I tend to be a deeper thinker than him. His thoughts are "what car accessories can I buy?" &amp; "What new weed accessories exist?" I am very pro-freedom. I ponder the world around me and how I'm getting screwed over. I'm also spiritual. I like to analyze the world around me and try to make sense of it.  I guess it could be worse. He may not be as annoyed by "the new normal", and doesn't like to hear me complain about it, but at least he's not accusing me of killing grannies. I guess it's good that that, with the 2 most pertainant issues that affect us, we basically agree on (mask n' vax).</p>

        <p>The partner is also on the "doomer" band wagon. But I have been slowly showing her articles and statistics, also when we go out I point out all the obvious signs of nonsense like how the local grocery store got shut down but Walmart was able to stay open. </p>
<p>She is slowly opening her eyes and starting to come to her senses. She has started questioning things she sees now also and comes to me to talk about certain issues she has concerns about.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel, it’s inescapable and constantly on your mind.  I used to argue with my partner about it, and it was horrible, but eventually he came around to the anti-lockdown side of things.  Now we’ve established a mutual agreement not to talk about it because it’s too depressing, but it’s hard not to talk about something that’s always there, everywhere.</p>
