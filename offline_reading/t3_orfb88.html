    <strong>Friends and allies in Ireland - and potentially further afield</strong>
    <p><p>I am wondering if there any people here from Ireland who want to connect.</p>
<p>I suspect that advertising ones location on Reddit might be slightly frowned upon, but in this case I think the risks of not doing so potentially outweigh the risks of some authoritarian creeps reading this.</p>
<p>Like most readers here I don't like the sound of the new normal. But ... I was never particularly enamored with the "old normal" either. If we object to the new normal I think we are at least partly under an onus to explain what we are <em>for</em>. In that light, here is my pitch.</p>
<p>I know many readers here probably lean towards 'libertarianism' in some way so I wanted to speak to that briefly ...</p>
<p>Very few things are as important to me as liberty - but I disagree with many libertarians on land ownership and the degree of faith they place in the "free market". (Regarding land, I am thinking of the 'Lockean Proviso'.)</p>
<p>I am genuinely looking for other 'libertarians' - but specifically that subset of libertarians who:</p>
<ol>
<li>are more interested in investing in relationships rather than pensions,</li>
<li>though they might champion the defense of 'private property', acknowledge that land (and certain other natural resources) are a 'special case', and</li>
<li>who put as much stock in friendships as in money.</li>
</ol>
<p>I respect the "free market" and people's right to participate in it, but believe that the relentless "pursuit of money" is a very narrow form of self-interest. I believe that other forms of human interaction - such as what David Graeber referred to as the 'human economy', or even a 'gift economy' (no explicit 'quid pro quo') - deserve consideration also.</p>
<p>Maybe this is too much information - but I thought it better to share too much rather than too little information. (I think that the unquestioning veneration of the 'free market' amongst libertarians is a little tedious and myopic.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Part of the reason I emphasised these ideas (thinking beyond money and the market) is because I think we need to be very creative in how we get ourselves out of this mess. Personally, I was interested in these concepts before Covid-19 and the Great Reset - and would still advocate for and bounce these ideas around occasionally even if this dystopia was not on the horizon - but these recent events do give us another reason to think outside the box.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lastly ... I am primarily interested in figuring out ways we can support each other - rather than in just debate and analysis.</p>
<p>Of course I acknowledge that debate and analysis are important, but at this point I think that certain aspects of what is happpening are patently obvious. If we don't do something soon, we will quite likely find ourselves in detention camps or worse.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Once we figure out how to prevent that from happening we might have more time for analysis then.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>E.g., can we figure out how to help people (including ourselves) who are at risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>being evicted by landlords,</li>
<li>losing their jobs,</li>
<li>losing their houses because they lost their jobs 12 months ago,</li>
<li>being excommunicated from their family and kicked out of their home,</li>
<li>suspended from their college campuses,</li>
<li>(before long) being unable to buy food or other essentials</li>
</ul>
<p>- all because they refuse to be vaccinated - or because they harbour skepticism of the prevailing narrative?</p>
<p>I don't know if we can - but I think we should put our heads together and try.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Ways I was thinking we could connect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>discord, Telegram, or other messaging channels</li>
<li>Fediverse node (e.g. Mastodon / Pleroma)</li>
<li>regular zoom meetings - or other video conferences or group calls</li>
</ul>
<p>I am open to ideas.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>P.S. Please don't hijack this thread with advocacy for crypto-currency. They are not the 'creative' solution I have in mind.</p></p>

        <p>I presume you are referring to Gemma O'Doherty. If so, I largely agree. She is a very brave woman.</p>
