<p>Are there real human people who think this way? Is it possible? I suppose so. People who don't have friends or families or children and literally never go outside (because of the deadly virus, you know) so they've completely lost all touch with reality.</p>

        <p>Because a mask, social distancing, and staying home is enough, also a hazmat suit is expensive. Also attacking my grammar is saying “I have no argument because I’m stupid, without saying “I have no argument because I’m stupid”. Plus I’m pretty sure you were still able to read it right, so is it that bad?</p>

        <p>The cheapest hazmat suit I can find is $28, or £20 where I live. That's absolutely affordable. A pack of disposable masks cost about £5 in any normal supermarket, so you're paying less for a hazmat suit in the long run than you would with masks.</p>

        <p>You’re a fucking fool. Wear a mask, it isn’t hard. If you don’t want your kid to wear a mask, keep them inside. You’re not responsible for other people’s health but that doesn’t mean u can go around spreading a deadly virus because you don’t agree with wearing something over your face. Not everyone can afford Hazmat suits but nearly everyone can afford a cheap little mask from a nearby shop. People like you are the reason why so many countries are being fucked over by COVID. It’s really not hard to wear a little bit of cloth over your face for the duration that you’re outside.</p>

<p>Bullshit. A cheap hazmat suit costs about $28, disposable ones are probably even cheaper. In the long run, buying disposable masks all the time is more expensive.</p>

        <p>The thread that you screenshotted and posted here. Also, there is no need for hazmat suits. If everyone were to just stay inside their homes and only leave when necessary for work/essentials then we wouldn’t be in the position we’re in now. And a hazmat suit is much more impractical than a mask. Also, in regards to you saying “everyone who is afraid of it and is high risk”, EVERYONE is at risk, some more than others but not all the deaths come from old people. Thousands of people are dying from this virus everyday and you can’t even have the morality to wear a mask? You’re pathetic.</p>

<p>You really think everyone would do this? You're naive to think 100% of the public will comply, with any plan the government proposes.</p>
<p>&rt; "And a hazmat suit is much more impractical than a mask."</p>
<p>No, it's not. Explain how it is. It puts you at almost zero risk, you can go anywhere you wish with it, and you won't have to worry about random people not taking precautions (which is inevitable, as any plan that requires ALL of the public to make it work, will fail). You just refuse to wear one because you'd rather control others.</p>
<p>Don't speak to me about morals when you guys are the ones supporting a fucked economy.</p>

        <p>Well obviously everyone hasn’t done it because we’re in the situation that we’re in now. But if everyone WERE to listen to the government then things wouldn’t be as bad as they are. </p>
<p>A hazmat suit is a full overall, it’s much easier to grab 2 strings, put them round your ears and pretty much forget you have a mask on your face, instead of wearing a complete plastic suit with some sort of mask which requires filters. You have to pay for new filters otherwise the hazmat suit is pretty much useless. </p>
<p>Also what the fuck are you on about controlling others? We just want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but a piece of shit like you doesn’t comply to the rules could easily spread COVID. That’s all we want, safety for ourselves and our loved ones.</p>
<p>Oh, and why do you think that the economy is completely fucked? COVID you nobhead. And you know what could potentially stop the spread of COVID? Staying inside, wearing a mask if you need to leave your house for work or necessities, social distancing and common sense. </p>
<p>Also, if you love Hazmat suits so much, buy one.</p>

<p>Again, you have unrealistic expectations. </p>
<p>&rt; "A hazmat suit is a full overall, it’s much easier to grab 2 strings, put them round your ears and pretty much forget you have a mask on your face, instead of wearing a complete plastic suit with some sort of mask which requires filters.

<p>So pay for filters. Not a big deal and they're not that expensive. If you're not going out often, you'll be buying them infrequently. You bitch about others not wearing masks, but you refuse to take maximum protection and wear full suits because its "harder."</p>
<p>&rt; "Also what the fuck are you on about controlling others?"</p>
<p>Wanting people to sacrifice their education, forcing them to wear something they might not want to wear, and telling them when to go out is controlling. </p>
<p>And what are you talking about that the economy isn't fucked? Are you actually serious right now? Are you arguing that lockdowns haven't affected the economy at all?</p>
<p>&rt; "Also, if you love Hazmat suits so much, buy one."</p>
<p>No, because I'm not scared of a virus like you.</p>

        <p>Well we wouldn’t need to pay for a Hazmat suit if we were to not leave the house. A mask would be sufficient enough if you don’t leave the house very often, which you shouldn’t be. Why should we buy a £20+ hazmat suit and also buy filters if we can buy some masks that are less expensive and be used just as much as the more expensive hazmat suit? </p>
<p>The only reason you’re being “forced” to wear a mask is for the safety of yourself and others. Telling people to wear hazmat suits would have the exact same effect, but worse. So many more people wouldn’t want to wear a complete Hazmat suit over a face covering, making more people ignore the rules, which would spread the virus even easier. </p>
<p>No education is being sacrificed, students are learning from home. The only reason that people’s education is being “sacrificed” is because now it’s much easier to decide not to learn. If anyone should be blamed for the lack of education, it should be the people who are denying their education and choosing not to show up to school-related video calls or not doing work sent to them via email or Microsoft Teams. Nobody is to blame but themselves.</p>
<p>Also, I never said that the economy isn’t fucked. I was agreeing that it is, but it wouldn’t be if people had common sense and listened to the rules. But there will always be people like you. </p>
<p>I really hope that the virus kills you, because the world doesn’t need people like you.</p>
