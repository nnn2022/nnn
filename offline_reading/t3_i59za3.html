    <strong>Why are people validating doomers' irrational fears????</strong>
    <p><p>If someone expressed fear about having to drive to get to school each day because they were afraid of getting into a fatal crash (the LEADING cause of death for school-aged children in the US, per <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2018/12/21/child-death">https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2018/12/21/child-death</a>), they'd likely be sent to therapy. Because even though there's a risk of death in many things we do each day, it's not normal to be so paralyzed with fear that you refuse to leave your house–rational people know this. Fear of getting into a car accident would NEVER be accepted as an excuse for someone skipping school. Again, they would be told to seek therapy for anxiety, and made to suck it up. </p>
<p>Why, then, are young people constantly whining about how they're going to "die" if they catch COVID? Why are these edge lords making memes and fake memorial pages and headstones suggesting that schools across America will become graveyards if they open this fall? From a virus so benign for them that they literally have less than a 0.1% chance of dying from it? A chance so small it hardly even registers on their cause of death list? And why are people acting like IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL to be so goddam afraid of this virus, even if you don't fall into a high risk category?</p>
<p>This royally pisses me off, because as someone who genuinely does struggle with things like anxiety and paranoia and have been working with therapists for a long time to try and get it under control, I'm FURIOUS that the world is tearing down my progress and totally backtracking on all that shit they told me for years about how it's unhealthy to dwell on irrational fears and let them take over you. And YES, covid IS a fucking irrational fear for young people, based on all the hard data out there!!!! The fact that people are acting this way about it makes me feel hopelessly sick inside, because it's showing me that you know what, maybe we <em>should</em> let fear consume us; maybe all those people who taught me to be strong were faking it all along and just feeding me a load of BS, because their actions right now are showing me that NOTHING they told me has any sort of credibility in the "real world"!</p>
<p>In the real world, it seems, it's better to lock ourselves away and worry about an essentially harmless virus for young, healthy people than suck up the risk and actually make a life worth living. The only people who should be seriously freaking out are older folks or those with compromised immune systems. But it makes ZERO sense why people act like it's perfectly fine and normal for high school and college aged idiots to accept their inevitable deaths or permanent injuries should COVID come their way, because it's just. not. true. Not statistically likely to happen AT ALL.</p>
<p>To say I'm disgusted with our society right now would be an understatement. The constant paranoia and doomerism is making me want to jump off a fucking bride.</p></p>

        <p>No, it’s not that simple. People aren’t stupid and they don’t just accept whatever is told of them. They need to feel safe and a new virus doesn’t make them feel that way.</p>

        <p>I don't know... I think people are actually that stupid.  Once they hear a thing, they cannot get rid of that initial thought no matter the data, logic, and reason thrown at them.  That's why the talking heads in the media are so dangerous.  They are crafting the narrative.</p>
<p>Once the media told people that the virus was &lt;this&rt; deadly, or spreads by &lt;this manner&rt;, or will kill &lt;this many&rt;, people just keep regurgitating the same thing over and over.   When presented with actual facts they claim those facts are wrong or just a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Example:  Children, schools, and COVID.  People simply refuse to accept the fact that children are for all intents and purposes immune from COVID-19.  Looking at actual CDC data backs me up on that.  Same with asymptomatic spread.  But people still think opening schools will kill all the kids.  It really makes me upset to feel like I'm helpless to persuade anyone, even with facts and data on my side.</p>

        <p>The problem with your analysis is that you suffer from the same faults as they do. You’re not immune from the problem of confirmation bias.</p>
<p>We all suffer from it.</p>
<p>Even incredibly smart people are prone to confirmation bias. They learn so much about a topic (say infectious diseases or any other disciplines) and when new information comes along that challenges the preconceived notions of what they know, they don’t just change what they believe or know to be true.</p>
<p>They fall victim to dismissing the new information and finding ways to rationalize their own opinions.</p>
<p>Level of knowledge isn’t the problem. It’s not about people being stupid and the smart people being able to see the truth.</p>
<p>It’s human nature to believe what they want to believe about a topic or an idea.</p>

        <p>Sadly humans are not rational creatures.</p>
<p>So the obese, type 2 diabetes smoker with an airflight phobia munching on a hamburger in the airport departure lounge is FAR more concerned with the astronomically negligible odds of dying in a plane crash than they are with cancer or heart disease, when there is an astronomically high chance of them dropping dead from their lifestyle at any minute.</p>
<p>And the people going out to swimming pools are far more concerned about catching Covid than they are about drowning, when it's far more likely they'll die of drowning.</p>
<p>You've done all the right things, keep doing them and try to ignore the mass hysteria.</p>

        <p>I was terrified at first, it had me so scared I feel like I looked my own death and that of my family ( something that I have tons of anxiety about) in the face... and facing your fear as it comes towards you is a huge part of feeling better. </p>
<p>Now that I see what living with this around us looks like... I feel so fuxkibgn lucky it wasn’t worse. I want to LIVE my life! And watch as my family live theirs.</p>

        <p>The fear is real, even if the threat that they’re afraid of isn’t necessarily really much of a threat.</p>
<p>Arachnophobia is real even if the likelihood of someone being attacked and dying from spiders is virtually zero.</p>
<p>You can’t invalidate someone’s fear and expect people to just get over it. No matter how irrational it is, you have to acknowledge the existence of the fear in order to deal with it effectively.</p>
<p>That way the fear can be shown to be more powerful then the threat and ultimately eliminate the fear.</p>

<p>My argument is: you can be afraid of a thing, yes.  You are human, of course you are afraid of things.  No one should begrudge you that.</p>
<p>However, just because you are afraid of a thing, it does not mean everyone has a responsibility to cater to that fear in exactly the way you demand it.  </p>
<p>Just because someone is afraid of spiders, it doesn't mean everyone else should be, either.</p>

        <p>And I’m not arguing that either. I take issue with your dismissal of fear and its effects.</p>
<p>Fear is as infectious as a virus. It’s a threat response mechanism. If someone in the room is afraid of spiders, it triggers a response in others. It causes people to increase adrenaline and ask:</p>
<p>“Is there a reason to be afraid of spiders? Maybe I should be afraid of spiders too.”</p>
<p>People aren’t afraid because they’re “catering” to people who are in fear. It’s a necessary part of the human response and can’t be just dismissed because “you’re not afraid”.</p>
