    <strong>Apparently I'm scum because I don't believe in the point in masks and living like this for years to come. Feeling such despair :(</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know anymore, everyone is so hateful. Can't they see that living like this is pointless? I don't know what to do. Everyone seems so content with living like this and want to spit venom on those that don't comply. Feels like a tyrannical world we are living for but they can't see that. The government are controlling us. As if they know any better than we do. No one has a fucking clue. Why can't we take the risk if that's the case. Why can't those at risk stay at home or wear a mask. I'm fed up, tired and don't know what to say to people anymore. This world is beyond bizarre and people want to be told what to do and trust and enjoy the government giving out their orders. I feel so ostracised. Anyone else feel defeated with all of this going on? I find solace in listening to people like Peter Hitchens and a few others who I believe haven't given in to this madness. Anyone else feel similar? What to do in times like these?</p></p>

        <p>There are people in your country and in your city who feel the same as you do. If you can find them and befriend them it may help; humans are not meant to be alone, especially when facing something like this.</p>
<p>So it's normal to feel as you do. See if you can find your people!</p>

        <p>I think lots of people feel like this way. And it’s devastating and maddening, of course. </p>
<p>Vacation to a free, unmasked place if you can. There are good recommendations on this sub for places to go. Parts of ID, WY, SD, IA, ND, UT in the west. Parts of NH, TN, FL, GA in the East. </p>
<p>If you are on the west coast, in the northeast or in MI, it’s possible that you’re in a skewed sample. And things aren’t as bad as they appear to you. Things are different in other places and seeing it with your own eyes will uplift you.</p>

        <p>So the best thing to do as cases rapidly increase day on day is to go to a massive protest with no-one wearing masks.. I understand things are currently frustrating here especially with more and more lockdowns and restrictions coming into force, but one of the reasons that will probably be shown to have started the second wave will probably be the number of people who have stopped wearing masks. I can never understand how anyone can consider wearing a mask restrictive or difficult unless you have severe asthma or another condition of the sort. Is it really that hard to wear one while you pop to the shops or pick up a coffee? Its hardly the same as being oppressed or controlled by the government. It's something that many people are doing to protect not only their own but also other peoples health as well. You will see how dire this situation will get over winter as the virus takes grip on society again. We can not eradicate the virus and we can only hope a vaccine will come soon but you have to understand that it is best if we not only wear masks when out and interacting with people but also keep the high standard of hygiene up to limit the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>UK here as well mate and I feel the exact same. I feel like I’m living in a clown world, everybody reciting Skynews and BBC word for word. I feel like I’m surrounded by a bunch of brainwashed morons, who if the media told them they must never see their loved ones again if they had the dreaded COVID-19 they’d straight up comply. No questions asked. As long as that’s what the media say.</p>
<p>Mobidly obese people shaming others for not wearing a mask, when these people literally cannot walk because of the shit they eat and drink. Content to take multiple tablets a day just to continue to live their shitty existence, but yeah make sure you wear your mask while you’re in Tesco on your mobility scooter. I mean come on it’s ludicrous. If the government even give a single solitary fuck they’d ban all fast food, make everybody exercise, educate people how to live a healthy lifestyle. But no, wear your mask. Don’t worry if you’ve compromised it over and over, just wear. Maybe wear gloves as well, which by the way should be changed ALL THE TIME! </p>
<p>There are still people however who refuse to believe the obvious lies, hypocrisies, propaganda, etc etc but unfortunately we are clearly the minority. The media does an excellent job of manipulating the masses to believe anyone that would dare speak out against the narrative, even question slightly, is a raging conspiracy theorist lunatic flatearther. </p>
<p>Ostracised is exactly how I feel. I don’t want to be around society, I don’t want to listen to the obvious bullshit over and over. Listen to some jobsworth tell me they’re saving lives by telling people to put on masks or preaching that young people are to blame, or the Asian minority, or the poor. </p>
<p>Anyway tldr people are idiots, there’s no point to even try and change people’s mind, it won’t work, they’ll always have some ridiculous answer. Some crap they’ve been told to think. At this point just focus on yourself, your loved ones, be good to the people that matter, ignore the ones that don’t. Things are going to get a whole lot more fucked up. Try and stay sane. Peace out ✌️</p>

        <p>I feel like anyone who still thinks masks are effective (disregarding entirely the argument of whether they are even necessary) should be forced to tear out drywall or mow dry grass with a mask on.  I have done both of these things and while the mask helps vs the dust particles some, you still get a bunch in your throat.  Last time I checked resp droplets and virus particles are smaller than dust.</p>

        <p>Have you thought of moving elsewhere? Not everywhere is crazy town. In remote areas, especially mountainous, in a few of the civilized countries left in the world, there is no “new normal”. Admittedly it is harder for Americans to leave the USA if they have no other passport.</p>

        <p>Understandable, I'd assume you are the smart kind that did stop taking precautions. I'm with you there brother, why taking my valious time looking at the traffic before joining the road, my seatbelts are nice and tight. If they worked, people would stop dying on accidents.</p>
<p>Oh wait, they keep dying! Fuck... That means there is no "science". Idiots like some guys just shout that at everyone who questions the bullshit seatbelts. If seatbelts were so affective, we could resume driving with no precautions and speed limits by now.</p>
<p>-As a side note, countries that did take the mask very seriously (mainly asian countries that did have a culture of using it before) are much better off and much closer to normal life than any of the peoplein countries actively saying they don't work.</p>

        <p>We can start with empirical evidence. Countries with people actively protesting against lockdowns, actively ignoring health guidelines and actively not wearing a mask because of their personal political bias, have had a good chunk of deaths per capita, their economies stagnant, and are restringed from travelling to other countries managing it better.</p>
<p>On the other hand countries that did the exact opposite of the listed above (Asian countries for example), have had a considerably better outcome in comparisson, and only hold few restrictions. People usually lists Sweden here "hurr durr never even went into lockdown and they are good" yes they did later on, and people who say that forget to mention their deaths per capita are almost the same as the US, so theres that.</p>
