        <p>I've got a hypothetical, and since you seem to be open minded, I'd be interested in hearing your opinion.</p>
<p>What if spreading lies, calling covid a hoax, and sowing doubt about the vaccine's efficacy is just a foreign power's plan to dismantle us?  With enough people buying into thier (hypothetical) propaganda via social media, they could delay or completely prevent our country's ability to get past covid for years to come. This would hurt our economy, restrict our personal abilities to travel freely, and shorten our lifespans. </p>
<p>People are definitely capable of evil things in 2021, I have no doubt about that.</p>

        <p>Well they are doing that shit with other things, trying to get people mad and riled up at eachother, but I feel it's too obvious to see what's really going on especially with our politicians acting in such selfish childish ways, like with this whole reversing trump policies.... Literally just because they're from trump... Good policies that benefit the people and the country, and it's the same politicians and people that fanboy for them(due to pandering) that push this bs so hard and dehumanize/humiliate anyone who thinks otherwise. They're trying to lock everyone up and wreck the economy for a fucking flu that's for the most part only potentially lethal to the elderly. They're changing definitions(herd immunity) and completely censoring individuals. When China(who is fully open) says they want Biden(who had deals with ccp) to be president, it's obvious to see what's really going on but as long as orange man it's gone and done tweeting mean things, democracy is restored😩</p>

        <p>I think an important question to ask in any domestic or global political/social movements, is who stands to gain from this? </p>
<p>I disagree that Trump's policies benefited the people, and that probably stems from some basic differences in our positions on issues like reducing pollution, strong individual/personal freedoms, ensuring people can visit doctors and dentists, and funding social safety nets like social security. I think plenty of his administration's policy benefited both himself and the rest of the wealthy elite, unfortunately. Deregulations, tax breaks for corporations, all of that wealth just pools to the top. You may have a different perspective, and that's fine. </p>
<p>That said, he was just a single part of the republican party. The republican politician's playbook has pretty much been to spread fear and sow doubt for a myriad of issues, in order to benefit the elite and corporate entities. There are probably some good, honest politicians in the republican party, but they are a minority. Most are lobbied and personally benefit from passing policies that benefit the elite.</p>
<p>The democrats don't spread fear as much, but they lie all the same. They promise and fail yo deliver. They're lobbied and paid off all the same. They give us a measly $1400 for the last year of hardships. Eight democrats refused to raise our wages, after they were elected to do so. The DNC held Biden up like a raggedy puppet, begging people to remember the relative "calm" before trump.</p>
<p>My current expectation is that Biden isn't going to be very different from Trump. He's not going to implement any meaningful changes that will benefit you or I. He's going to continue to do things that benefit the rich. He's basically a republican dressed in blue. </p>
<p>Our country's political compass is so skewed, somebody like Bernie Sanders seems "radical" for talking about stuff the rest of the world already has had figured out for decades, stuff that would be considered centrist in most first world countries. You may disagree, even think I'm an idiot for even mentioning Bernie, and that's cool. But I'd urge you to consider the fact that since our shit is so fucked on both "sides", we're not benefiting from our government one way or another.</p>
<p>Who benefits from blurring these lines within our individual realities? Who benefits from separation and polarization of our countrymen? Who benefits from saying Covid is a hoax? Who benefits by molding our opinions on the vaccination? Who benefits from keeping covid restrictions around? Why would they want us to have yet another reason to be in opposition instead of cooperation?</p>

        <p>Aaand there’s the answer in your response - this whole thing is more about people supporting Trump than anything else.  So denying the reality of covid and all is also a political move? Cool.</p>

        <p>No you ape, I'm pointing out how they're acting in a "anti trump" manner, I don't worship any politician, they work for the people they're not superstars. Policies like ones for the border, how tf does opening our border during such a lethal pandemic help and protect the American people?? It's obvious they are doing it to insure more voters cause they're losing their grip on us black and Hispanics that are starting to see how they're being used</p>

        <p>I’m
Not sure I’m following.  Calling covid a hoax and getting people to not take a rushed vaccine for a disease that factually has not proven to be any more deadly than the flu...  would be accurate and smart; how does that dismantle us?  The only thing dismantling us is the lockdowns.  The hypothetical doesn’t work unless in this hypothetical you
Change covid to actually being deadly, but then that’s a completely different scenario where there is no half/assed lockdown because people actually would be dropping like flies and afraid to go out.  if that were the case this whole page would not even exist nor be necessary in the first place.  </p>
<p>Also you seem to falsely pair together as a necessity; covid spreading with the economy shutting down or a travel ban.  These are government mandates that have nothing to do with covid spreading or not spreading.   (As again we have states as evidence showing lockdowns do not change amount of cases or spread.)  I think I need to reiterate that the entire reason of this whole page’s existence, NNN, is due to the fact that covid is not nearly as deadly as the media claims nor does it warrant the reaction we’ve had from our government.  If covid were very deadly then this would not be a debate to begin with.</p>
<p>I guess my point is there exists no possible situation where we’ve been “duped” into thinking covid is a hoax.  The reason we think it’s a hoax is because factually it has proven to not be as deadly as the media claims.  It’s really that simple.  If it were in fact deadly and we were “duped” into thinking it wasn’t; well that’s not even hypothetically possible because  then we’d be personally seeing the effects of it and not need the media to tell us how bad it is to begin with.  And again even in your case, the hypothetical“duping” of say, Texas, into not worrying about covid and opening up, has not resulted in any problems that “dismantle” them in any way whatsoever.  So it’s just not a possible hypothetical.</p>

        <p>You sound convinced many people have been duped, so you do acknowledge duping people is definitely a possibility, if not a reality. You are just also convinced that person being duped is not you, which takes a world of confidence. </p>
<p>If there's a possibility where covid is a hoax, there's also a possibility that the "covid is a hoax" platform is a hoax itself.</p>
<p>So an analogous argument would be climate change denial. A portion of people think that the scientific evidence for human induced climate change has been fabricated in order to benefit the elite class. They would claim that we've been brainwashed into our way of thinking, think we're being controlled.</p>
<p>But that same person would deny that they themselves could be subject to a sort of brainwashing or control in order to benefit the elite. Even though there's strikingly similar motive and means to do it. </p>
<p>Either could be true, but we as humans tend to only be able to hold one side of an argument in our heads at one time, often not seeing the common threads that bind them.</p>

        <p>Yeah no I see your point, and it would make sense in a different type of situation where there were two different active narratives being pushed.  But you’re not seeing the reality of this actual situation.  The simple reality is that the doomer narrative is the only narrative being pushed, and any opposition is being censored and ridiculed.   </p>
<p>NNN can not even be called a narrative; it is rather individual people coming together and voicing skepticism on THE narrative.  How on earth can observing the issues in the mainstream narrative itself be a “hoax”?</p>
<p>To make a hoax is to create a lie;  we are not creating anything; we are simply responding against the claims that covid is so terrible or that lockdowns are necessary; based on all of the factual data revealing these facts.  (Such as suicides being counted as covid deaths, for one example).   It’s logically (and hypothetically) impossible for mere skepticism to itself be a hoax.  </p>
<p>Calling our views a hoax would be the equivalent of that classic scenario where two kids try to sneak into an adult rated movie dressed up as a man in a tall trench coat, and when the cashier realizes it and calls them out on the hoax, the kids’ response is “No, YOU’RE the hoax!”  </p>
<p>When we merely observe the facts indicating that covid is a hoax, and you say “what if YOUR position is the hoax”, you are logically the equivalent right now of those two kids screaming in response “No, YOU’RE the hoax!” To the cashier.  </p>
<p>There’s just absolutely no substance or even possible logic to that claim.  The onus is not on us to even give your claim any credit because it is logically not even possible in this actual situation for us to be the hoax, based on the definition of what a hoax is.</p>

        <p>Reading studies from CDC and independent sources indicating that the virus is being treated far worse than necessary. covid deaths are over-reported because they attribute any death in which the patient had covid as a "covid death" which is misleading. I.e. you could be shot dead in the street, while you have covid, and they will list you as a covid death. Masks show little to no effect on case or death growth rates. I.e. masks are useless. Giving government authority to shut down the entire livelihood and culture (being social with other humans in person) is historically ominous. The common sense part, is that the entire "pro mask" fear brigade is using this whole situation as an excuse to lecture, yell, and patronize anyone who disagrees with them. They use the situation as an easy path to attain moral virtue. You can browse popular reddit threads to see this psychology - they wear masks to signal to others how virtuous they are, not because they actually believe they work. If they believed masks were essential then they would all be wearing n95's, gloves and faceshields in public - but they don't. They do the minimally necessary action to attain a sense of moral superiority. It's a giant mess.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oh and the other reason I'm skeptical is that we locked down the &rt;99% majority to "save" the 1% who are vulnerable, instead of locking down the 1% to keep the rest of society going on with their lives. Total incompetence. We know the vulnerabilities, obesity, diabetes, lung problems, being old - and being generally unhealthy. Why didn't we give these people resources according to their vulnerability? Instead of wrapping 1% in bubble wrap, we wrapped 99% in bubble wrap. The more you think about it, the dumber it sounds.</p>

<p>Testing is limited and costs money. Nobody is rushing to pay for anything potentially extraneous these days. The cost alone of testing all of our nations healthcare workers on a regular basis would probably be quite substantial.</p>
<p>We would also be utilizing scarce testing resources. This means that we might not have enough tests for regular joes like us when we need it. </p>
<p>Additionally, medical professionals have training with PPE. So even if they did have covid asymptomatically, they would be at a decreased chance of spreading it because of the availability, training, and use of the PPE. </p>
<p>Of course, there is no way to avoid exposure. My wife is a nurse, and she's seen plenty of outbreaks over the course of this last year. Her pregnant manager was out sick with covid, and her company made that manager use PTO for the duration of the 2 week quarantine. </p>
<p>Shame, it always comes back to money somehow.</p>

        <p>I get that logistics play a part in this, but I would argue health care would be a priority for testing over the droves of people pointlessly getting tested because they have the sniffles.</p>
<p>I get that these workers PPE help reduce spread in the work place, but they could expose their family.</p>
<p>I think asymptomatic spread is over exaggerated and instead of giving tests to people who are more likely to be exposed to covid, they want to mass test to increase case numbers and use it to excuse restrictions and mandates.</p>

        <p>They are a priority for the vaccine, right?</p>
<p>Also, if they did mass testing to increase numbers, how would you explain the large proportion of negative test results? Wouldn't they just give false positives if they were trying to exaggerate the asymptomatic spread? Something like 95% of tests come back negative. </p>
<p>I'm not a virologist or even great with biology, but I can see the value in having a wider net cast for data analysis and review of different strategies, rather than focusing on testing only hospital workers.</p>

        <p>Here is a  conversation with a medical doctor about unknown danger of mRNA vaccine that I recorded. </p>
<p>Tldr; A doctor has legitimate sounding worries that mRNA vaccines will kill brain cells and repeated exposure will result in neurological disorders.</p>
<p>I think lipid nanoparticles may have too broad a tropism, far broader even than attenuated virus vaccines (which are still limited to the tropism of the wild-type virus), and thus could pose a uniquely high safety hazard due to cytotoxic attack on the broad cellular range that uptakes the LNPs. Since the LNPs would enter cells via endocytosis, the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes would be expressed on MHC-1 molecules, making them targets of cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes, attacking a much greater range of cells than any previous vaccine modality. This is concerning in general, but it’s a nightmare scenario if the vaccines are crossing the blood-brain barrier and endocytosing into e.g. oligodendrocytes (multiple sclerosis risk) or motor neurons (which could possibly cause an ALS-type picture). No other vaccine has this broad tropism. That is THE major safety concern here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because of the anatomy and circulatory trajectory from the deltoid and cephalic vein (essentially a straight shot into the SVC), if enough “spillover LNPs” are getting shuttled into the right atrium and transiting through the pulmonary circulation — which could be high, another reference here for the rich vasculature around IM injection — then one of their earliest stops on the map after exiting the heart would be in tissues serviced by branches of the common carotid and subclavian arteries (including the CNS), enhancing delivery to tissues behind the blood-brain barrier simply due to higher relative concentration at tissue corridors more proximal to the injection site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if initial transit through the BBB and into other sensitive tissue parenchyma is relatively low, there’d be a cumulative effect with each booster delivering more spillover LNPs to those non-local sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related to that point, the duration of immunity is still unclear, and there seems to be general agreement that while COVID-19 symptoms are reduced with the immunization, viral spread is not. If antibody and memory B/T-cell levels wane within a few months after vaccination, then we’d be looking at repeated boosters possibly multiple times a year given ongoing community dissemination. And since the development of many e.g. CNS disorders is gradual — with subclinical issues taking shape over years before clinical manifestations become apparent (as seen in MS and ALS) — such cumulative damage likely wouldn’t raise red flags at first, but could increase in likelihood with successive boosters.</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>I’m in the medical field, here to report that basically what occurs is a lot of practitioners or staff just pretend to go along with whatever the patients stance is to avoid any drama. 
Many will lie about their vaccination status to patients too. I think ppl fail to realize not everyone has the same opinion as what the mainstream media wants them to think</p>
