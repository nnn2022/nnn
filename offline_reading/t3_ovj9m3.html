    <strong>Anyone else feel like we’re winning this war?</strong>
    <p><p>It seems like with more and more people waking up they’re rapidly losing power and their narrative is crumbling. Typically when you wake up you don’t go back to sleep so every person counts. </p>
<p>I’ve also never seen trump supporters this active even when campaigning, if he doesn’t win next election it will shock me. </p>
<p>I live in a liberal state and I’ve never seen this many people not wearing masks since 2019. There’s that 1/100 that continues to wear a mask and be a good little rule follower, but I think covid is over. </p>
<p>These variants and lock downs are such eye rollers and I’m not sure how many more lockdowns people can take before they just don’t lock down anymore. </p>
<p>I’ve never felt better since the pandemic started and I’m excited about life again.</p></p>

        <p>Same for me in a blue state on the East Coast. People are freaking the fuck out about being around people without masks (and reports are over 70% of adults got their shots) and I just saw a notice from the place that does my eyebrows that they won't treat anybody who doesn't present proof of vaccination, without an explanation of a medical issue that prevents you from getting it. FUCK THAT!</p>

        <p>Wait what?! I am in a blue state on the east coast, and when I go out maybe 1/10 people are wearing masks. I haven’t seen anywhere requiring the vax for entry either thank god. Although it would be great if they identified themselves so I could stop shopping there.</p>

        <p>More and more employers require vax. If your really rich you can continue to buy stuff, but if you need a job in order to afford restaurants, food, etc, you are more and more likely to need vax. Education also requires it many places.</p>

        <p>I think you’re looking at it a little short sighted. There is already a huge employment need in America. Jobs are hurting for people. Requiring something that half of America isn’t going to get may get a few stragglers to get the clotshot but not many. There are also 100% going to be people on the opposite side of the spectrum who are against it, and own businesses. I’m not worried at all. </p>
<p>If they try to mandate it, and people start leaving their jobs, and they can’t fill enough jobs because no one wants it, they’d be forced to change their plan.</p>

        <p>I haven’t worn a mask in months and most people here aren’t either. Or maybe I just ignore the people that are? Either way, I’m not in a major metropolitan city. I have no need to lie about my day to day life. Probably 75% unmasked here, and I see a lot of American flags on pickup trucks and people living life.</p>

        <p>Lots of American flags tells me you might have a lot more people leaning right than my area. I live in a pretty liberal and ethnically diverse area, so of course they're right on board with the agenda. And I say this as a poc whose political views span the spectrum - I don't agree with either political party. But I have a neighbor who I share my real thoughts with, and he has traveled to areas with a much higher percentage of conservative-leaning populations and they weren't even wearing masks when it was fully mandated indoors in their states. I was kind of jealous!</p>
<p>In my area, it was just about a month ago that seeing people mask-less in store started to be common. And now it's swinging back the other way, people are back to masking out of caution.</p>

        <p>I see a majority of the people wearing masks are not ones to approach me about my lack of one that’s for sure. I see a ton of kids and younger persons not wearing them, or adults either. I also live close to a pretty popular summer vacation area, but there is a high crime area right by it. Both are equally diverse but I don’t know. Maybe in the coming weeks I’ll see more masks.</p>

        <p>Maybe my area just sucks, then. The mask signs are much more relaxed, but I see more and more people in masks, despite the high vax compliance percentage in my area. Today was the first day I tried telling two friends who I've had good, balanced conversations with about C-19 that I <em>haven't</em> taken the jab and was sure they'd never want to see me again (still tbd.) I'm trying not to live too much in my head but yeah, I'm definitely at the point where I feel the noose tightening. Especially after the eyebrow place decided now that they don't want to deal with anybody who isn't subjecting themselves to the injection, even though masks were always required there.</p>

        <p>I have to disagree with you. Their main source of power is the US Dollar and the federal government just missed raising the debt ceiling. They will default and most likely within the next few weeks. When this happens, currency becomes completely worthless and physical gold and silver rise to their fundamental, non-manipulated values many multiples higher. The data proves this.</p>

        <p>Yes, depends on where you talk about but in most places the real fear isn’t there anymore. Media and gov are doing their hyping and fearmongering and powergrabbing and some people are going through the motions but many others are waking up.</p>

<p>Our government has been quite careful not to push things quite as hard as the US federal government or other European nations. Maybe if they really go for it like Macron has in France people will awaken and shit will kick off.</p>

        <p>Nope they are very supportive of the whole thing. They are controlled by their emotions, and very easily too. The media/government does a good job of layering the tyranny with decadence.  A little lockdown here... A little free money there... A little close your business here... A little free money there... A little jibjab here... A little closed business because of said jibjab there... </p>
<p>It's a war of attrition. </p>
<p>My family say they believe the injection works, but told me I can't see my grandfather this week because I came into contact with an injected asymptomatic carrier (only tested by PCR). My grandad is injected. </p>
<p>So if the injection works, why isn't it working? </p>
<p>They just say it is working. Probably because it feeeeeels better than accepting that it's not. People are catching covid and genuinely believing that if it wasn't for the jab they would have been in hospital, but they aren't thinking that it's strange that a vaccine they had less than 3 months ago has already let them down. </p>
<p>They just started the freebies in the UK too. Young people can get a free taxi and free take away food if they go get poked.</p>

        <p>The great majority of military personnel will reject the shots on the basis the order is unconstitutional. Based on the fact it's an unconstitutionally elected cabinet. Now I do not support djt as he pushes the vaccines but he did win the election and we all know it. We see maricopa refusing to give up the routers and passwords. We see the ga and wisconsin evidence. But sadly our scotus refuses to see the evidence and take the case. Poor corrupt usa.</p>

        <p>I have to disagree with you. Their main source of power is the US Dollar and the federal government just missed raising the debt ceiling. They will default and most likely within the next few weeks. When this happens, currency becomes completely worthless and physical gold and silver rise to their fundamental, non-manipulated values many multiples higher. The data proves this.</p>

        <p>Because a collapse is not the problem, it is the solution. The system is already dead from literally over a hundred years of theft, extortion, abuse, corruption, fraud, money laundering, and frankly every terrible thing humanity has ever done. So when the system finally collapses, all of that stops on the spot.</p>

        <p>Yes. That's exactly what needs to happen. A gold standard prevents this type of corruption and mass theft. It’s a MUCH fairer system for the people who actually use the money, rather than the ultra rich 1% hellbent on destroying the world for their greed.</p>

        <p>The thing is, the system will collapse no matter what they do. That part is inevitable. How it turns out is ultimately up to us. If humanity gives in and goes with that social credit system, even if they were coerced or deceived into it, then they're stuck. The rest of us can choose to go with a gold/silver standard on our own by getting the metal ahead of time. Actively telling the elites we will not comply, and putting our money where our mouths are.</p>

When this happens, currency becomes completely worthless and physical gold and silver rise to their fundamental, non-manipulated values many multiples higher. The data proves this.</p>

        <p>…it’s all Monopoly money now. Government has the resources it needs to defend itself and the ruling class. Now the only people who care that it has any value (which they’re driving it at 120mph into a brick wall) is us, the lowly plebs they’re allowing to wander around and do their building for a pittance of a wage and a sense of purpose (or not).</p>

        <p>Sorry, but I really feel like we're losing and the rate at which we are losing is accelerating. I had thought we would start to see something like a return to lockdowns in some places in the late Fall / early Winter. Then it was looking like maybe that was moved up to right after Labor Day. Now, I think we'll see fairly broad lockdowns (all states w/ Dem govs or RINO govs, i.e. nearly all the states that locked down the first time) by the end of the 2nd week of August.</p>

A traditional job is yet another tool to prevent you from ever achieving anything in life while the company you work for acquires all the wealth and power you have provided to them.

        <p>No. Today I saw more masks at the grocery store than I have since last year.  I live in a conservative state, didn’t expect.
Ever since slow Joe did his thing, states and hospitals are following suit.
I just hope people don’t cave. We have power, look at restaurant staffs, can’t even get people to work.  Everyone quit.  All sorts of places can’t even get help.  Screw’em.
I’m personally Livid they are treating nurses this way. They worked on the front line the entire time and now throwing them under the bus.  Mandating the vaccine.<br>
You’d think the case count was back to Jan numbers the way they are acting.  Nurses made it all this time; sleepy Joe speaks, and it all changes.<br>
Wonder if the libs will blame him when hospitals are understaffed and no one is there to take care of Covid patients....or unvaxxed in their minds.
I have seen countless nurses that have been there 13-20 yrs walk away.<br>
This country is gonna be in a mess.
Connecticut, 63% vax rate, yet cases up 148%.  Vermont 67% vaxx yet 129% increase.  I’m gonna enjoy watching them squirm to explain it when 80% in some states are vaxx and it’s still increasing...pfizer is now only 84% effective after 6 months....countdown to 0%</p>

        <p>The only win in my opinion, would be people getting together, forming their own community and government, living completely independent from big corp, producing everything needed to survive. That's a true win against NWO. Anything else is a delusion or a distraction, leading society to the inevitable NWO "utopian" agenda.</p>
<p>Ps. No real "conspiracy theorist" who actually does research believes in the political circus.</p>

        <p>Another depressing sign is that you now see mainstream personalities and outlets saying many of the things we've been saying here since this began, e.g. Jon Stewart. BUT, after saying that they jump right back into the propaganda basically ignoring the implications of everything they just said. I don't think this fits the dictionary definition of gaslighting, but it is definitely a related narcissistic mind control strategy.</p>
<p>For example, the NYP (you know the "conservative" newspaper) editorial today is entitled "Ignore the hysteria: It’s time to move past COVID, America". </p>
<p>https://nypost.com/2021/07/31/ignore-the-hysteria-its-time-to-move-past-covid-america/</p>
<p>It starts out well enough with stuff like:</p>
<p>&rt; The latest Team Biden and CDC guidance is a hopeless mishmash based on fear, politics and butt-covering, not solid science. The data behind new guidance about the Delta variant, as Dr. Joel Zinberg noted in Saturday’s Post, are “preliminary,” based on small, possibly unrepresentative samples. One study involved the AstraZeneca vaccine that isn’t even used in America.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Let’s face it: The CDC and its public-health peers have been disaster shows all pandemic long (recall the test it insisted was the only acceptable one, until it turned out to not work?), but the failing has reached the level that the only rational thing to do is to not take its hopeless advice as gospel. Be sensible, but don’t let the scaremongering stop you living your life.</p>
<p>Nice, right? We're winning, right?  But... then ends with stuff like:</p>
<p>&rt;So get vaxxed. Don’t make a scene over the stupid “Mask on the planes, trains and taxis” rules. Try to persuade any unvaxxed friends and family to get jabbed. (But don’t scream: It doesn’t help; people have reasons that make sense to them.)</p>
<p>So "Yeah, the CDC, FDA, WH and everyone else in the public health space absolutely cannot be trusted. That being said.... do absolutely everything they say for some reason and hey, while you're at it, try to make everyone you know fall in line too. Wear the mask. Take the shots. Don't complain. #Based!"</p>

        <p>I think the media and government tightening its grip and amping up the fear and restrictions is a sign that we are making headway and that things aren’t going the way the media and government want, but I would not conflate that with winning the war.</p>
<p>As others have said here, they didn’t come this far to simply let us win and say, “well shucks, guess we’ll just have to do better next time.” We’re in for a lot of hurt with new restrictions and mandates. I hope it’s not the case, but you can see it being pushed and promoted in the media, meaning it’s probably only a matter of time and they’re trying to expose people to it to help cushion the impact when it’s done.</p>

        <p>Same here. I was in Seattle and Portland recently and both are incredibly liberal cities. Every store, restaurant and bar had a “Mask Required” sign. However 1/10 people wore a mask and no one told me to put one on a single time, even the people working there didn’t tell me to. This was a really big surprise to me</p>

        <p>No. This country is still under a state of emergency as they continue to push injections for a virus that does not exist. What are they so anxious to inject into everyone?

        <p>hospitalizations are up because people are seeking/needing treatment for underlying conditions that were delayed when 'elective' stuff was stopped last year. hospitals across the usa laid off tons of staff back then</p>
<p>and don't forget that they get more money for every 'case'</p>

        <p>I have to disagree with you. Their main source of power is the US Dollar and the federal government just missed raising the debt ceiling. They will default and most likely within the next few weeks. When this happens, currency becomes completely worthless and physical gold and silver rise to their fundamental, non-manipulated values many multiples higher. The data proves this.</p>
