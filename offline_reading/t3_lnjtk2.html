    <strong>Truth has been buried.</strong>
    <p><p>There is a definite problem with
Finding truth and I have been examining this for a lot longer than I’m comfortable with.</p>
<p>We have absolutely all information available to us all the time. And people obviously understand that this information needs to be vetted because information doesn’t automatically mean truth and fact. This information is chalk-full of fabrications, imaginings, re-creations, and agendas. So people have been forced to pick where they get their information from, and by gawd, when they get that information it’s the final word on the matter.</p>
<p>Here’s where the problem is and where I’ll lose a lot of you: there is no journalistic integrity and there hasn’t been since man realized that sensationalism sells. Fear sells. So what do we, the consumer, the product, do? We flood the market. We panic buy.  So Fox News does it, MSNBC does it, CNN does it, and so on ad infinitum. Showing you all the little ads in between. Nobody is above it. Because they want you watching and buying. These news entities are in competition to get more people all of the time.</p>
<p>Here’s one example of this extremely obvious mixing of truth and lies given to us on mass scales.  Anthony Fauci is chief medical advisor. He’s a physician AND a scientist. And in May he said flat out masks don’t work to stop the spread. Then news networks scrambled to say he changed his mind about all that and that we absolutely need to wear masks.  I’ve heard the argument that not enough was known about the virus and new facts came to light about it and that changed everyone’s mind. I don’t buy it. Our doctors knew a lot about this virus already (the 18 strains before it) and it helped them map out the new strain. Fauci saying so confidently one minute that masks don’t work and then saying the opposite just doesn’t add up. I don’t think fauci is stupid, and I don’t think you get to be a doctor asked to be chief medical advisor by being stupid. Maybe he is though, he fumbled pretty terrifically with AIDS. He’s saying what he’s told to. And just given a million bucks for “defending science”? Folks, science defends itself. Propaganda on the other hand needs an awful lot of defending. And coercion.</p>
<p>Now if you can’t see an obvious connection between our government and our media publishers look at where the money comes from. Look at who owns the networks; who donates to the right and the left sides of the aisle. Who benefits from small businesses shutting down? Who benefits from people relying on the government? Corporations. Government. And I know it’s taboo to mention, the wealthy elite?</p>
<p>So that leaves us with an important question, and that is where do we get truth?  I think...Personal connections, personal experience, and asking more meaningful questions.</p>
<p>I had a moment when I was discussing the impact of fossil fuels in personal vehicles on our environment. I started thinking about bigger vehicles. I asked someone and they mentioned cruise ships. One Princess cruise ship puts out as much carbon monoxide a day as one million cars. Now, maybe that’s false,  the statistics online could be exaggerated, but put it into perspective and think about the amount of fuel your car holds versus how much a cruise liner takes. Think about sitting the two engines next to each other and it’s not hard to make that comparison. And if you really think we need to shut down oil and coal in the US, why don’t you do a quick search to see what the other countries are doing this year. There are thousands of new coal plants going up all over the world. Except for here.</p>
<p>Information without discernment is just chaos. Inside I believe each one of us knows how to pick out the truth from the falsehoods, but we need guidance to do so. People think knowledge is king so they learn and expand their minds constantly, and others also take good care of their bodies to stay at the top of their game. But what about the third side of this triangle? Body, mind, soul. Nurture your spirit as much as you take care of mind and body and all three just start running in sync with each other. Baby bye bye bye.</p>
<p>And take this to heart. Politics is not your personality. Get one if it is. Because none of you understands it enough to be standing on your virtual soap box screaming about it. I don’t understand it and that’s why I don’t push a side’s bullshit. I only understand enough about politics to know the government does what benefits itself instead of what benefits the people. It hurts me to see everyone so complicit in this consumption of us by the leaders of our country.</p>
<p>And I think I’ve made myself clear about where I stand on most things, but just so there’s no question about it (since I don’t post ten memes a day about my political leanings) I’m pro-choice(because if I a child is born while it is UNWANTED it is so likely to have a life filled with at the very least neglect and poverty, and likely abuse of all sorts. If we want children to be born no matter what we need to have tons of couples on standby ready to adopt), pro-legalization, pro-2A, pro-2 parent families, pro-adoption, taxation is theft.</p>
<p>I really don’t want this commentary to be viewed as anything besides my own observations. The things I see in all this information that we have is that we just don’t care what the truth is. We’ve got the links to back up whatever claim we like. With no discernment. No dignity, no integrity, no anonymity, and no respect.</p></p>
