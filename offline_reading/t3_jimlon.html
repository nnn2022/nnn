    <strong>Why do people think that if a cloth mask can catch droplets then it can also prevent the spread of covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I can't tell you how many people I've argued with who think that if a cloth mask catches droplets then it can also prevent covid. There are many other factors at play besides catching droplets which may lead to covid spread. First, the virus can be aerosolized, so if the mask doesn't fit tightly or does not filter out the virus perfectly, then the mask wont work. Secondly, if the mask becomes moist then the virus will pass right through. So, unless the mask is worn for a short period of time and then disposed of, it becomes basically useless. Third, if someone does has covid amd they touch their mask then everything else they touch will be contaminated with the virus. </p>
<p>But, people on reddit seem to believe that catching droplets = prevents covid, ignoring all the other factors which come into play.</p></p>

        <p>The people that act like this literally think because they have a mask on they are 100% safe from everything...  You see them touching everything, touching their masks, then at the end of their outing, take off the masks, and put them in their pockets or cars ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>The argument that " surgeons wear masks" yes they do, but they are in a sterile environment! They take off the mask at the end of surgery and it is carefully disposed of.</p>
<p>Better of just using hand sanitizer..and washing hands when you get home..</p>
<p>Just like I've done for the last 5/6 years.</p>

        <p>Surgeons also are in temperature controlled areas so they can breathe properly with the masks </p>
<p>The whole "surgeons wear them" argument also doesn't make sense cause they wear them for other purposes "not to prevent spread of virus"</p>

        <p>I don't even use hand sanitizers. Water, and sometimes with soap is the best.</p>
<p>The more chemicals added in to a product, the more likely it'll cause problems in our body. You may have seen news of hand sanitizers recalled.</p>
<p>Even certain soaps can be suspect. In Canada, Triclosan, a chemical used in many liquid soaps were to be not used since it was found it'll cause issues. Triclosan is an anti-bacterial agent.</p>
<p>Excessive use of pharmaceutical drugs also cause issues, such as anti-bacterial resistant bacteria. Triclosan is thus a double-whammy in this regard. There was a campaign going around with the slogan "Not every bugs need drugs" or something.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree with you in regards to antibiotics where they can cause bacteria to become resistance to the drugs if over used.</p>
<p>In regards to anti bacterial gel it's something I've used for many years, at work, before I eat, thats due to for example being on the tube knowing how many people go toilet don't wash their hands and then touch the poles while standing up, which I then touch and I really don't want their germs on my hands..üò®</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve been watching people sneeze and cough with a mask on without covering their mouth with their arm. Shit still flies out of the mask and the sides of it and a virus goes right through it. </p>
<p>It seems to me that wearing masks and not covering your sneeze or cough is actually WORSE than not wearing a mask and still covering a sneeze or cough with your arm. Masks are actually creating a society of people who are less hygienic when it comes to not spreading seasonal viruses.</p>

<p>That's what they think, I don't see that as the problem. The problem is when they force you to wear a mask or stay indoors which destroy your health. </p>
<p>So that's the argument. A stranger comes and dictates what's "healthy" and what's not to you the moment he doesn't even know you. And he's also accusing you that you carry a disease without proof. And the moment you explain that your health is damaged because of these restrictions and completely ignores what you say and how you feel.</p>

        <p>If I might, people of all stripes seem to be engaging in a bit of overgeneralization here.  Kind of strawmanning the issues.</p>
<p>Why do THEY believe Covid is  hoax?  People are obviously dying!</p>
<p>Why do THEY believe masks can stop Covid?  People with masks are obviously catching it!</p>
<p>Fact is there are only a small number of people that believe that Covid is a made up disease.  Most who who believe this believe that it is a new virus but is being over-hyped by government and media.</p>
<p>Fact is there are only a small number of people who believe that masks can totally stop Covid.  Most believe that it is a useful somewhat effective tool to slow the spread.</p>
<p>They latter groups are both correct. </p>
<p>So to address the OP,  masks DO slow down spread. They don't prevent you from catching it. They don't prevent others from catching it.  But if everyone wears a mask, the transmission rate goes down. </p>
<p>Also fact:  Practically no one wears a mask correctly and all the time, so the effect is pretty small.</p>

        <p>I really don't wish to get into a battling studies argument.  Of course there are studies that show this.  And there are studies that show that they don't.</p>
<p>If an illness is spread through oral exhumations it only stands to reason that a mask will slow it.  Not stop it, but reduce it.  Statistically in some instances it seems to work.  If a condition is spread by spitting in someone's face, and fewer people spit in other people's face, the rate of spread will slow.   Not 100%, maybe not 50%  but it will slow.  Some spit will always get around.  Not a reasone to NOT slow it. </p>
<p>This is not a defense of mask mandates.  But both sides need to accept a bit of science and common sense.  Masks are neither 100% preventative NOR 100% useless.</p>
<p>I leave the question of whether it is morally right to mandate them the student.</p>

        <p>Catching droplets isn't the only factor in spreading covid. There are many other reasons why wearing a homemade cloth mask offers basically 0 protection and may actually increase risk of infection. </p>
<p>That's why there needs to be a study to prove that cloth masks can prevent or slow the spread of covid. There actually is a large Danish study I believe, it's a peer reviewed RCT, but major medical journals refuse to publish it. </p>
<p>You can believe that they help, but it's only a belief, there's not proof</p>
