    <strong>Why the poverty angle is the best bet when making our case to doomers:</strong>
    <p><p>The entire media apparatus has them convinced that lockdowns and masks work, so that angle is a lost cause. Plus the whole virtue signaling thing makes it an impossible sell. The strongest argument against lockdowns is poverty.</p>
<p>There was an article in the NYTimes a few months back fearmongering about how covid claimed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/health/coronavirus-statistics-deaths.html">2.5 million potential years of life in the US</a>. Using the same framework, according to MIT, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/study-rich-poor-huge-mortality-gap-us-0411">the wealthy, on average, live about 12 years longer than those in poverty</a>. Eight million Americans were impoverished because of lockdowns, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/8-million-americans-slipped-poverty-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-new-study-n1243762">NBC</a>, meaning the years of life lost to lockdowns in America alone (even ignoring the mental health stuff, delayed treatments, etc) is in the range of <em>96 million</em>. That's more than 2.5.</p>
<p>Extrapolating to the world at large (and, let's be honest, poverty is much more extreme in the global south and Africa than in the US), the World Bank says <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/07/covid-19-to-add-as-many-as-150-million-extreme-poor-by-2021">lockdowns have sent 150 million more people into extreme poverty</a>, defined as less than $1.90 per day. Assuming the 12 year life expectancy gap, which is an extremely conservative estimate, it means on that on poverty alone lockdowns have cost 1.8 billion years of life. See how a virtue signaling doomer responds to that</p></p>

        <p>Won't phase them a bit. They don't care about people at all. This isn't about saving lives, it's about obedience and they hate they we're not playing along, non-conformity is disturbing to them.</p>

        <p>There's no dealing with them. They have to be destroyed personally by the lockdowns for it to hit home.</p>

        <p>I think they would like it. It shows how virtuous and selfless they are. All it would take is some propaganda saying having a house is bad for the environment and people with jobs are spoiled and selfish, especially the ones that eat every day.</p>

        <p>Very. Very. Bad idea.   </p>
<p>They are going to poverty angle to take away from those who work and save.   “Well it’s not fair that <strong><em> should cost </em></strong>_ to ___ !    We need to increase the taxes on you so things are ‘equitable’ “. </p>
<p>People are so stupid and think that anything that comes from the government is free or has no cost.</p>
