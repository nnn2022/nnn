    <strong>Some Possible DD regarding Pfizer and their credibility.</strong>
    <p><p>Just came across this thread on a subreddit called CovidVaccinated (recommend you check it out) that’s titled ‘anyone regret getting the vaccine?’ </p>
<p>The comments under there are... i had to make this post.  I can’t link anything and type text in here so I’ll try and link some stuff in the comments. </p>
<p>People claiming stuff from soreness to heart conditions and being woken up. I just did a quick search of ‘Pfizer lawsuits’ (another thing I recommend you do) and found an article from November 2020 that brings up some wild topics. For instance they received the biggest fine in us history for paying doctors to say what they want them to. It’s all in the link. </p>
<p>Astounding. Pfizer is pfucked.</p></p>

        <p>Welcome to waking up, my friend. Keep on heading into the rabbit hole. You'll be blown away, and probably a bit depressed at the same time. The world, and especially social media/major news corporations is a wild place right now.</p>

        <p>Its pretty incredible that you can use an example of the government oversight leading to a huge fine for a pharmaceutical company as evidence of a vaccine conspiracy. Why would the government set up a process that pfizer broke the law by circumventing, then investigate pfizer, then litigate pfizer, and then fine them billions if they are in cahoots and the government WANTS THEM to hurt you lol?</p>
<p>Pfizer is literally over 170 years old, am I supposed to be horrified by a list of wrongdoings where the majority is literally fines for marketing tactics and not paying taxes lol?</p>
<p>What you've just illustrated is how willing first world democracies are to stand up to companies like pfizer and hold them accountable</p>

        <p>I’m simply demonstrating this companies credibility is questionable at best. They paid doctors to say what they wanted them to say once why wouldn’t they again? Did you even read that sub Reddit of people
voicing their concerns? You literally just told me that you’re A-OKAY with government corruption and big pharmaceutical. Say what you want in response to this but I will not answer. I cannot help you.</p>

        <p>&rt;I’m simply demonstrating this companies credibility is questionable at best.</p>
<p>You haven't done that, because demonstrating a company that is almost 200 years old isn't credible when it comes to VACCINE PRODUCTION, because of a bunch of marketing related fines, isn't shocking or revelatory.</p>
<p>Is there a single drug manufacturer who has existed for even HALF as long that doesn't have a similar record?</p>
<p>&rt;Did you even read that sub Reddit of people voicing their concerns?</p>
<p>See, you have to disregard the data from every countries vaccine reporting system, assume they are in on a coverup with all the scientists and organizations that helped conduct the trials, and I'm supposed to believe in that conspiracy based on anonymous posts to reddit lmaoo, k</p>
<p>&rt;You literally just told me that you’re A-OKAY with government corruption and big pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>What you've outlined is that the worlds first worlds democracies are so vigilant at holding drug companies accountable, they will levy billions of dollars in fines for simply circumventing an official approval process and airing unapproved commercials</p>
<p>You cannot help me, because the best evidence you have is anonymous posts on an internet message board lol</p>

        <p><a href="https://ibb.co/3kqBkY8">HERE </a> is an instance in which the company in question was sued for producing a virus in the lab and infecting a worker with it. Then covering her up. From that article I cited about their wrong doings. Just tax stuff though.</p>
