    <strong>Is it just me, or does it seem like people are invested in the virus and want it to be deadly?</strong>
    <p><p>It’s weird, I’ve noticed doomers come on here to argue with us, and despite all of the evidence of this not being nearly as deadly as portrayed, they tend to get very angry (emotions are a strong sign of a programmed response), and then wish death upon you. You would think most people would take the statistics, and what is happening in Florida and Texas as great news! Instead, it’s becoming very apparent that there is a concerning percentage of people who seem to actually delight in this all, and want it to be as bad as possible just to prove some point. It really does seem to me that there are those that want life back to normal, and those that want this to go on forever. Evidence be damned.</p></p>

        <p>I'm yet to be physically accosted for not wearing a mask but I suspect that my retort would follow the lines of "do you think covid will fuck up your breathing? When I break your nose you'll be <em>really</em> worried about your breathing."</p>
<p>I'm a default pacifist but even a rabbit bites when threatened. Natural law includes personal responsibility to protect your physical wellbeing.</p>

        <p>The Public Freakout subreddit has had a lot of these types of videos lately. I’ve seen two already today: one where a guy is attacked from behind while shopping at Walmart and another where a guy is head butted while riding the bus. As you might predict, the comments are mostly in praise of the attacker.</p>

        <p>Lock down is great for keyboard warriors. It's easy to say something, virtue signal online, and there's plenty of validation to be had with likes/ follows/retweets, etc. I guess for some people it's all they got so keeping things like this is a benefit to people like that.</p>

        <p>Yep. Throughout all the plagues in the past, they locked themselves in their houses and no-one had to hear their BS. Of course, back then plagues would kill at least more than 0.12% off the population in a year.</p>

        <p>Back then they didn’t have the technology to track and catalog every last spec of viral RNA on the planet and then broadcast it onto your 60” flatscreen TV in real time 24/7.</p>
<p>None of this would have happened 10 years ago. Teleconferences still largely sucked balls, internet wasn’t as fast, social media was different, mobile phones weren’t as powerful, etc.</p>
<p>10 years ago the only artifact of this pandemic we’d see is more signs reminding us to cover our cough, wash our hands and stay home when sick. It requires a massive level of arrogance to do what we did now.</p>

        <p>Few things at play, beyond the “some people like this bullshit because reasons” group: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>humans hate being wrong and will often go out of their way to avoid appearing to be, or even internally acknowledging that they are, wrong (if lockdowns not necessary, then their support for them may have been wrong) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for humans who have fully placed their trust and obedience in government, it is scary and distressing to acknowledge that your relevant government may have been wrong (if Florida is doing it right, then your pro-lockdown leaders might be doing it wrong) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for humans who have personally endured hardships or made sacrifices for lockdowns, it is painful to acknowledge that those hardships might not be necessary (eg you refused to visit your grandma who begged to see you for a year, so the idea that you were wrong to do that and hurt her as a result is tough to accept)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Psychologically, doomers went all-in on lockdowns. Anything to even suggest that their massive investment in supporting lockdowns was a mistake will flip the majority of them out, because they’re human.</p>

        <p>I understand it is human nature, but I can’t help but find these people to be disgusting. They act like they care about grandma, but would rather see grandma die and be proven right. As a general rule, they love to virtue signal and feel morally superior.</p>

        <p>I agree with you completely - it just helps to understand these aspects of human nature (and they are disgusting). </p>
<p>Even doomers who change their mind will often find a way to do so without ever acknowledging that they were wrong (“I was right to be a doomer then, but now I’m not because something changed; I was right when I supported lockdowns and I was right when I stopped supporting them”). </p>
<p>On the flip side: when you see someone openly acknowledge that they were wrong (about anything they held strong opinions on) and have changed their mind, you’ve likely found a quality human. That’s often a reliable indicator of higher intelligence and good character (much more so than simply holding the “right” position to begin with). There are plenty of ex-doomers in these subs who fall into that category.</p>

        <p>Very well stated. I’m open to the fact that I’m probably wrong about 99% of what I <em>know</em>. I guess that’s because I understand I am human, and I’m not attached to any particular outcome. I only want the truth. People tend to be so committed to outcomes, that truth is of little relevance to them.</p>

<p>Bingo. </p>
<p>In my experience, many people who are committed to a particular outcome (including the outcome of “my original opinion is right”) literally cannot comprehend the idea of anyone being committed to the truth rather than an outcome. It is super frustrating.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's a good observation.  </p>
<p>I'm not really sure where this comes from, unless it's blind partisanship.  </p>
<p>I think looking at which party those people support, things start to become more clear.  They are supporting the line fed to them by the establishment.</p>
<p>They might be similar to the characters in 1984 who engage in the Two Minutes Of Hate, screaming at the TV daring anyone to defy them.  </p>
<p>From there, I suspect this still has very much to do with Donald Trump.  It's almost as though they need a villain, and they need to defy him.  Pure partisan knee jerk reaction.</p>
<p>It is very disappointing to have watched way too many people go down this road.</p>

<p>You can argue that most of them are also just  ignorant about the dangers of the vaccine ("[they're] not a doctor!"), and the medical facts surrouding this. Yet people here excuse Trump and treat him like a hero, while saying everyone else on the "other side" are evil demons who deserve to die from whatever is contained in the vaccine. </p>

        <p>Not really. You just want to employ mental gymnastics to defend your favorite politician. Both sides are guilty of this. </p>
<p>Like all politicians, I think Trump has (or had) access to the "real data" that showed this virus was a nothingburger. He just continued to peddle the narrative anyhow. For what reason? We don't know, but I highly doubt he's just an innocent who had no idea of what he was doing or what he was pushing with the lockdowns and vaccine.</p>

        <p>Something about Western culture or the way the news is reported would be my guess. I’m in Japan.  In Tokyo they’ve been closing bars at 9 for the last 2 months (which is nonsensical) and basically everyone wears a mask, but there’s zero politicization of covid. A large percentage of the Japanese population is going to refuse to take the vaccine not because they’re anti-vax but because it hasn’t gone through proper testing yet. I’ve had disagreements with Japanese peers regarding masks, lockdowns, etc. but it’s never ever become personal, just a polite disagreement as these things should go. I haven’t lived in a western country for years so I don’t have the knowledge to speak about what it is specifically that is different from Asia.</p>

<p>Identity politics is largely not a thing in Asian countries.</p>
<p>Western governments have spent the last several decades pitting different groups against each other and asserting that all their problems are the fault of somebody else. This is the result.</p>

        <p>Mental priming. They desperately want the data to fit their first impression (which incidentally was heavily influenced by crappy data and emotion). </p>
<p>FYI an IFR of 3.4 means that up to 10 million Americans would die. Not an insignificant number. Thank god the virus wasn’t that deadly. But when subsequent data shows your initial instinct was incorrect, you have to reassess and change course. I honestly thought this was gonna happen in April (wrong).</p>

        <p>There was a podcast where Adam Carolla interviewed Alex Berenson a while back. I remember Adam talking about his changing views on the virus. At first he was concerned and truly worried, especially when celebrities started to catch it. Then he did his homework and realized something smelled fishy. What he did not do is “throw all his chips down onto the table at once”. He “put a few chips down in the beginning” but was willing to pull them back or put more down as he got more information.  A lot of these doomer fuckers threw their entire stash onto the table and have yet to pull any back out....</p>

        <p>We've been seeing this since Georgia started reopening last spring. They were rooting for it to fail. It didn't happen. Instead, the worst states were those with strict lockdowns and restrictions, and that remains the case to this day. They want to be proven correct that we are doing the right thing by destroying the economy, but the data does not support it. Mitigation measures do not work. The data is clear you're going to go through seasonal patterns for your region no matter what you do. If you lockdown, you just have to deal with economic fallout as well.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, we've known since the beginning that mental health is tied to the unemployment rate, and then there are the side effects of being locked up. Not to mention health in general. We've forgotten (and tried to reclassify) everything else for this one virus.</p>

        <p>This is true and if you see any good news on even the main corona subreddits, they quickly try to make it bad news (even if by all metrics, it is good news). They deep down, either WANT it to go on longer, despite their words about wanting it to end, or they are scared of being proven wrong, so they grasp at straws perhaps.</p>

        <p>Disagree here... I'm an introvert, perfectly happy with my own company and a select few, I do sit at home mostly (through disability)...from a very personal perspective early lockdowns were great for me - far less idiots on the road for one!</p>
<p>However, I've been staunchly anti-lockdown since before they were even introduced because I could see exactly what would happen if they were</p>
<p>My son is an introvert and also very anti-lockdown/mask/measures like me... he's worked every single day of the scamdemic despite being in a v vulnerable group and been bombarded with letters to shield</p>
<p>Weak-mindedness is their common denominator, I believe...in fact, most of those I know who are eating up this BS are far from introverted - just no independent critical thinking skills...the kind who 18months ago were saying "I hate the Government, all out for themselves" yet suddenly think "this is about our health! They really care about us!" - total morons</p>

<p>Introvert here. Stop lumping us with the antisocial weirdos who get off on death in the name of public good. We just like to have smaller groups of people to be around and enjoy more solo activities. </p>
<p>However, I don't want it all to be forced; these lockdowns aren't helping anybody and I can already predict the nasty effects it'll have on people, not to mention a generation conditioned by the "new normal."</p>

        <p>this exactly, thats why you will see its mostly left wing people like redditors, because they are more likely to be unsuccessful and unhappy and thus crave the feeling of power in general, which they get not by achieving goals but controlling others, i think its something like that.</p>
<p>its the same kind of people that get powertrips, the same kind of people that would torture jews at Auschwitz, the same kind of cops that use police brutality, the same kind of people telling others to wear a mask or tbat they are not allowed to see their children in the hospital.</p>

        <p>I've noticed this for a long time, especially with the "wait two weeks" crowd.  Since last year, they have consistently been disappointed that people are not dropping dead in the streets, and that large gatherings are not producing the sort of "superspreader" results that they had anticipated.  I recall remarking last spring, possibly in my provincial subreddit, on how their constant frothing at the mouth, waiting for mass death was especially odd in the context of them calling me a selfish murderer for stepping outside my house.  The angry downvotes pretty much always confirm that what you're saying is correct, and has hit a nerve.</p>

        <p>From the very beginning I was amazed at how eager people were to have this be as bad as possible. It was like on a wall inside their head they had that X-Files “I want to believe” poster with the UFO on it.</p>
<p>Fuckers simply refused to remain calm and think rationally or skeptically.  The amount of word salad vitriol you’d get hurled at you for even daring to say “maybe it won’t be that bad” was (and still is) off the chart. The number of people who call me “dangerous” and a host of foul insults when I post a simple screenshot of the Washington state covid dashboard showing now <em>not bad</em> things are is infuriating.</p>
<p>It is truly fascinating watching what happens during mass hysteria. It just really sucks being trapped in it. The only blessing is I live in the USA and I’m privileged enough to escape my state and travel to Florida to regain sanity.</p>

        <p>If you asked them “do you hope you are wrong, and the virus really isn’t a big deal?” I believe they would hope they are not wrong, even though that is a really good thing. They are attached to the outcome, and it is astounding to see. They are not operating in good faith. As an example, I think Biden and the Democrats are going to do irreparable damage to our nation, however, I <em>hope</em> I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>They're totally attached to the outcome, great call. This reminds me of the time I was telling someone in my local sub (now banned) that this virus didnt warrant our reaction and something else is going on with our governments and this stinks of a power grab and wholesale change of our living conditions via government dictate and this will go on much longer than 2 or 3 weeks, finished off with the "I hope I'm wrong" line. His response was to tell me to come back a year from then and see how wrong I was. It's been almost a year and where I live new restrictions were just put into place at the beginning of the week. They're imploding the economy so all we have left are shitty big chain stores that can afford to lose a few weeks of revenue.
I'm sad I cant comment on that sub anymore to say "told you" lol</p>

        <p>I've noticed the entire United States has a portion of the populace, a large portion, that are fascinated with "disaster" and calamity.  They are not-so-silently cheering for the next shoe to drop, at every turn.  From the fascination with murder story documentaries, to global pandemics, they can't get enough.

        <p>I don't want anyone to die before their time, and telling strangers on the internet to die is a pointless venting of emotion.  </p>
<p>I think there are misinformed extremists on both sides.  I have disagreed with extremists on both sides.  But there is a lot of false information shared in this subreddit.  People shouldn't based decisions on false information or selfishness.  </p>
<p>I want nothing more than to go back to normal.  That is the biggest source of my frustration with people opposed to vaccines and people who deny the seriousness of the virus that we are battling.  I see the path to normal through mass vaccination and continued efforts to stamp out the virus, to the point where the risk of getting Covid is the same as the risk of getting other diseases that we have nearly eliminated through vaccination.  </p>
<p>The level of care that needs to be taken is directly proportional to how many cases are in a community.  That is not a threat, it is logic.   I want my kids in school maskfree in the fall and I want to travel with family and friends, and eat in restaurants, and have a big backyard barbecue.  You can tell me I can do those things now, but I want to do them when I know that I am being considerate of the higher risk members of my community.  My cancer survivor friends, my parents' generation, those with health challenges.</p>

<p>Nope - Everyone is free to make their own choices, and <em>encourage</em> (not force, not punish if they don't comply) others to do whatever.</p>

        <p>I said everyone should be able to choose for themselves, and you said that only works if there's no false info, which implies that if there <em>is</em> false info (which is always), you want gov restrictions on business, whether it's closing it down or limiting its capacity.

<p>Okay, then let me rephrase: People lie about shit all the time, that doesn't give state governors the authority to tell private businesses that they're not allowed to be full or else they get shut down. Seems a bit nitpicky, but whatever.</p>
<p>There are already rules for things like max capacity and table spacing (fire/health code, etc.). If you want virus rules, fine - there's a system for adding them, and it's not executive orders.</p>
