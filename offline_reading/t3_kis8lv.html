        <p>They found that places with mask mandates had more cases than places without, and concluded that mask mandates don't help. That's some serious science right there.</p>
<p>Next they should compare how many people die in hospitals (from all causes) compared to other places, and conclude that nobody should go to a hospital.</p>

        <p>Your statement makes ZERO sense. Why are people so obsessed with the magical masks? Is it a cult now? Because you do understand viruses and bacteria are invisible right? And that they are smaller than the mask holes? Or are you still really really confused? 🤔 masks spread infection. Wake the fuck up</p>

        <p>Yes but when those droplets dry, you're left with viral particulates and aerosols which stay in the air for extended periods of time, that is according to Fauci and those around him. They can easily become airborne and supposedly infect those who come into contact.</p>

        <p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>Fauci said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZcTqW1Ngj4">that mask may help someone "feel better" but don't do much</a> .</p>
<p>Also from the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not. </li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and “did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.”</li>

<p>Here is something you might find interesting:</p>
<p><strong>CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</strong> page 39 they have not isolated the virus :</p>
<p>"<em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.</em> <strong><em>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</em></strong>*, <em>assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied BiosystemsTM 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real- Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use</em>*.

<p>This is further corroborated by Dr Tom Cowan in his <a href="https://blog.nomorefakenews.com/2020/10/19/dr-tom-cowan-explores-the-covid-virus-invented-out-of-sheer-nonsense/">article</a> titled:</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tom Cowan explores the COVID virus invented out of sheer nonsense</strong></p>
<p><em>“First, in the section titled ‘Whole Genome Sequencing,’ we find that rather than having isolated the virus and sequencing the genome from end to end, they found 37 base pairs from unpurified samples using PCR probes. This means they actually looked at 37 out of the approximately 30,000 of the base pairs that are claimed to be the genome of the intact virus. They then took these 37 segments and put them into a computer program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs.”</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was done by assumption and arbitrary inference. If this is science, a penguin is a spaceship.</em></p>

        <p>The article you linked measured effectiveness of a <em>recommendation</em> to wear masks. Masks fight coronavirus spread by lowering Rt. A small change in Rt, e.g., from a few individuals that decided to follow the recommendation, will not have visible effect. To make a difference, Rt needs to be brought down below 1.</p>

And how about the fact that microscopic virus particles are obviously going to get through not-so-microscopic spaces in the fabric?</p>

        <p>I’m against masks but even I understand the idea that they prevent you from spreading something if you were to have it, not protect you from others. They don’t stop the virus itself but droplets from breathing, talking, or coughing. </p>
<p>Masks are probably better than nothing if you use them as intended, but most people reuse disgusting cloth masks that are likely detrimental.</p>

        <p>Mask hygiene is possibly quite dangerous. I think since asymptomatic transmission is so low, it doesn't make sense to wear masks unless you are sick. And if you are sick, you should be at home recovering. Also, the microscopic size of the particles can get through the gaps in fabric, so it will still go through in the form of aerosols, though droplet transmission is lowered. The effect of masks in protecting others isn't really proven, but I'd imagine while they may be helpful they can't be that effective if masks are not effective in protecting the wearer. Either way, their effect does not justify a mandate.</p>

        <p>From the article:</p>
<p>"The analysts allowed the mandate states a 14-day grace period from the time of implementation in order to begin counting cases against mask efficacy in order to arrive at accurate results."</p>
<p>"Supporters of the protective-mask mandates might say that the mandates were often imposed once cases already spread quickly, so there’s a negative bias of increased cases in those areas (or times) that had mandates in place, but there was “no evidence of any reduction in cases or even better outcomes many weeks later,” Horowitz writes."</p>

<p>A comparison should be between "with masks" and "without masks", not between "before" and "after". Otherwise you can conclude that water is poisonous because everyone who drank water eventually died.</p>
<p>Look at the countries that have beaten coronavirus like South Korea and Taiwan, and note one common thing they do differently is wearing masks. They did not even have to to any lockdowns.</p>

        <p>If you read the whole article, it states that they compared:</p>
<ul>
<li>with and without mask mandates</li>
</ul>
<p><em>and</em></p>
<ul>
<li>before and after mask mandates</li>
</ul>
<p><em>as well as</em></p>
<ul>
<li>adjusting for population density</li>
</ul>
<p>All analysis showed the mask mandates resulted in more cases per population than no mask mandates.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> kind of study that would be more conclusive, and should be done, is a Randomized Controlled Trial with some communities being assigned mask mandates and some not. Since this current research shows that mask mandates may be increasing cases, there is no ethical reason to not carry out a RCT study.</p>
<p>Hope that the government listens to the science.</p>

        <p>Population density is not the only confounding factor. They did not control for implied number of infections, therefore their conclusion is akin to saying that the wind is blowing because the trees are swaying.</p>
<p>RCT is not the only way to do science. You don't need to perform RCT to test if Newton's laws work. Likewise, in this case you can separately test the two hypotheses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by droplets or aerosols, and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks substantially reduce the number of droplets or aerosols people exhale and inhale</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By now there is plenty of evidence to support both, otherwise you would not see doctors and nurses who care for COVID-19 patients wear N95s.</p>
<p>Now if you believe that SARS-CoV-2 is spread by electromagnetic radiation from 5G towers then sure, there's no point in wearing masks.</p>

        <p>In physics you control all the variables and study the one you want. In medicine, a RCT is a close as you can get to that, since you are basically studying the human body which is very complex and affected by human actions and thoughts.</p>
<p>Just because that's how you think this virus acts, doesn't mean it actually acts that way. There are other confounding factors like people touching their mask, poor fit, and being over-confident in their mask, to name a few of the more obvious ones.</p>
<p>A RCT is designed to look at the overall, real-world effectiveness. Your statements are equivalent to doing tests on cells in a pietrie dish - those results don't always apply to the real world, which is why RCTs are done.</p>

        <p>The way droplets and aerosols travel through the air and filtered by masks is well understood through physics. The only reason US has two orders of magnitude more coronavirus deaths per capita than Hong Kong, Taiwan, or South Korea is because half the people in the US lack critical thinking skills, don't know enough physics to understand how masks work, blindly trust politicians, and are inventing excuses instead.</p>
<p>We can't get coronavirus under control not because people wear masks incorrectly, but because people refuse to wear masks.</p>
