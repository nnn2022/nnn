        <p>Video title: 2019 'Project Runway' Contestant Named Kovid Who Made Masks Has People Buzzing</p>
<p>From the description: </p>
<p>&rt;Clips from a 2019 episode of “Project Runway” have been making the rounds on Twitter and TikTok after fans noticed that the show has a wild connection to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  </p>
<p>&rt;Season 17 of the fashion design show, which aired in 2019, included a designer named Kovid Kapoor. </p>
<p>&rt;One of the challenges during the season was called “Head To Toe,” which called for contestants to create a printed design that was featured, well, head to toe.  </p>
<p>&rt;Kapoor’s design for the challenge eerily evokes a look that would become all too common just a year later. In a red plaid design, Kapoor created a suit with an accompanying face mask.    </p>
<p>&rt;A year later, people on social media can’t help but notice how Kapoor’s garment foreshadowed a look we’d all be sporting in 2020, and how similar his name is to the virus COVID-19. (A name used in Indian culture, Kovid is actually a Sanskrit word meaning “intelligent or poet.”)  </p>
<p>&rt;Additionally, two of the hosts of the show repeatedly called Kapoor’s plaid mask outfit “sick.” A TikTok of the exchange from user @Joanschumachermartin went viral over the weekend.  </p>
<p>&rt;People have periodically recalled Kapoor’s appearance and design on Twitter over the last year, with one particular fan garnering the attention of “Runway” host Karlie Kloss.   </p>
<p>&rt;HuffPost reached out to Kapoor for his thoughts on the coincidence. He didn’t respond, but he did share a tweet that seems to indicate he finds the conversation he’s ignited to be humorous.</p>
<p>&rt;Well, Kovid, we can only hope you’ve made more masks in the last year, because we’re sure they’ve come in handy.</p>
