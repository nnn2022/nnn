        <p>I've read several articles about people in their 20s that "died" of COVID19, but when you reads further you can see many of them had battled cancer or other diseases several years before the virus. It's easy to just blame the virus and forget other relevant information. Many headlines are clickbaity and it's drawn out of proportions. The virus isn't dangerous for everyone, but some people wants it to seem like it's Ebola.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry for his wife and children ofc, but the title is really misleading. As a bodybuilder it's quite likely he was on anabolic steroids, and being juiced up for years is really damaging for the hearts and arteries..</p>

        <p>Stories like this eventually become giant piles of horseshit. It has happened over and over again.</p>
<p>The original story comes out, its 6 pages long and on the front page of every major newspaper and website....</p>
<p>"An unborn child died from coronavirus today, becoming the youngest person to ever succumb to the virus. The fetuses mother and father also died after testing positive for the virus."</p>
<p>All the crisis builders over in the coronavirus rooms hold a virtual tear collecting session, where they remind each other that they are surrounded by white supremacist and that the president is the one who somehow killed the family. The story is read by millions within 3 hours. The esteemed doctors and scientist hold a press conference to tell us that we are the most selfish species in history and to announce that we're in for a looooooong, miserable winter.</p>
<p>Three weeks later the Monowi Gazette, in rural Nebraska, does the follow up article about the family. Its two paragraphs long, stuck on the last page in the arts and entertainment section...'</p>
<p>"The unborn child that reportedly died from coronavirus recently, did not die from coronavirus. The young mother and father suspected of dying from the virus did not die from the virus either, although their reported positive test results for the virus were accurate. Both were tested two months ago and both tests did come back positive at the time. However, three days after receiving the tests both were informed the test results were false positives. The medical examiner released a report on the deaths yesterday, stating, "after proper examination and extensive testing, I can state with confidence, the three unfortunate and untimely deaths were caused by severe and traumatic injuries sustained in the horrific automobile accident, the family was in, that occurred on I-95 three weeks ago."</p>
<p>The second story is usually read by 8 residents at the Monowi Gardens Assisted Living Facility. If it is ever presented to any of the mythical virus worshipers, they tell us it doesn't matter, the accident would've never happened if the president had done his job better and if we had just worn our masks. They demand we still believe all three deaths should be listed as virus deaths because, you know, TERROR and stuff.</p>
