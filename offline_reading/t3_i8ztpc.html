        <p>The arguments for seat belts are lazy. For one, seatbelts actually work. Masks have dubious effectiveness at best and at worst can make you more likely to get infected. Most jurisdictions don't have seatbelt enforcement as a primary focus. Whether or not they abuse that is another discussion.</p>
<p>Besides, the only place you wear a seatbelt is in the car. You don't wear one in the store, the restaurant, or especially your home.</p>

        <p>And a seatbelt does nothing if you are just sat in your car overlooking a nice view.  This is what gets me the most, even if you could acknowledge some effectiveness to masks indoors, it's people sat outdoors on a lovely sunny day, with their face muzzle on, that's what really gets me, and it's like sitting with your seatbelt on without the key in the ignition and saying it makes you feel safer, it's that ludicrous!  I suppose you could fall out of the car 😃</p>

        <p>The long term health issues one makes me want to scream because its retards purposefully misunderstanding, or maybe they're just dumb, I'm not sure. Either way, yes some coronavirus patients will have long term health complications. This is true of almost all severe respiratory illnesses. They can cause scarring in the lungs, and decrease lung capacity and oxygen absorption. This isnt new or weird or unstudied. And it doesnt happen to everyone, usually only those who are so sick they need ICU care, and often a ventilator. The vents themselves can cause permanent damage to the lungs as well. The fear mongerers assume everyone who gets the virus will be hospitalized, but the majority are asymptomatic the entire time. Not having symptoms, yet having long term health issues that kill you down the line sounds like some movie plot BS.</p>
<p>As far as the "heart disease" or whatever else they're pinning on COVID, prove it. Prove the dead person did not already have heart disease due to poor American diet and no exercise. Until then I dont believe a coronavirus causes things like heart attack, stroke, etc. Those just happen to be some of the leading causes of death in the US. Hmmmm...</p>

        <p>If it makes you feel any better, Reddit is notoriously pro-covid. People in the real world aren't <em>quite</em> as loony, and I'm sure a lot of people are against the masks and such but go along with it because it's easier to go with the flow. (cough spineless weaklings cough) Even though deep down they probably disagree with it.</p>

        <p>This is the logical fallacy of false equivalence (and it may also include others).  It requires that you consider wearing a seatbelt as essentially the same type of thing as a lockdown when in reality those are very different propositions.</p>
<p>There are other ways to rebut the “argument” (I happen to be against being forced to wear a seatbelt for a number of reasons), but this is another tool in the toolbox if you want it.</p>

        <p>When people say "if you agree with seatbelt/drunk driving laws, you should also agree with mask laws" they're being imprecise, usually unintentionally. What they actually mean is "you were ok with the government intruding on your freedom in the interest of public health before coronavirus, why are you no longer ok with it?"</p>
<p>Which is a fair question in my opinion. They just don't present it fairly. And the rebuttal will depend on your own views.</p>
<p>A) Evidence for driving laws is stronger then evidence for masks. This is an ok argument but you're almost never going to convince anyone to change their mind with it because it comes down to a subjective choice. There is no logical reasoning for the amount of evidence needed to make this choice. Some people have a low threshold of evidence needed and they'd rather be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>B) Tell them you're also against these examples of driving laws and you would be in favor of slowly phasing out laws like this. This is my preferred argument. I think people should be allowed to make their own decisions and then, if necessary, held responsible for negative results of their decisions. People should want to wear seatbelts because it's obviously the smart choice. Letting governments make decisions like this for the people assumes that government officials know what they are doing (clearly this is not always true) and it also takes away peoples' autonomy. This is not progress, it is regress. (sorry for being long-winded on this one but I feel like this is a controversial opinion that requires at least some explanation)</p>

        <p>Yeah I'd love to know how to rebut this. I got into the seatbelt argument with someone, but I personally think seatbelt laws are stupid. If I'm a full grown adult, I think the choice (and of course the consequence) should be mine and mine alone.</p>

        <p>Same. I'm not going to go out and protest about being forced to wear a seatbelt like I would a mask, tho, because seatbelts aren't even in the same ballpark as masks with how uncomfortable and invasive they are. Not to mention seatbelts don't keep everyone on edge and afraid of people not wearing one. I don't think they should be mandatory or given a fine for not wearing one, but to compare them to masks is lazy and ignorant of why people don't want to wear them.</p>

        <p>The rebuttal I could see in response to that is that not everyone who drives drunk will get into an accident, and not everyone who gets hit by a drunk driver will die. Both the virus and the drunk driver can easily kill certain people in the right context. But not everyone gets killed in a drunk driving accident as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps a rebuttal to this rebuttal could include data on how many people die from getting hit by a drunk driver divided by how many people get hit by a drunk driver and comparing the death rate, but I don't know those numbers.</p>

        <p>Yeah that got brought up, too. And tbh, idk if I like drunk driving laws either. Like if you have a few drinks but can still drive perfectly, who cares what your BAC is? Some people drive like drunks when they're 100% sober (old people!!). As long as you're following the laws, who cares how drunk you are? Now, if you're swerving in and out of your lane, not stopping at stoplights, etc. then that should be a crime... but that's already a crime when you're sober too.</p>

        <p>Also BAC doesn't mean the same effect on everyone. Someone lightweight could get drunk as shit on one shot, whereas it may have nearly zero effect on another person. So that metric isn't the most useful.</p>
<p>There are also people who tend to drive extra carefully when they are not sober, to the point that they are in a sense better drivers than when they are sober and more careless. I have been in cars many many times with a driver who is not sober, have yet to be in an accident. Though to be fair, the substance used was not alcohol so idk how that all compares.</p>
<p>I haven't made up my mind about DUI laws yet, haven't thought through it enough.</p>

        <p>My husband just suggested that drunk drivers have a light on top of their cars to alert those around them that they're drunk. And if someone is drunk driving without their drunk light on, then it's a crime. I kind of think it's a brilliant idea 😂</p>

        <p>LOL that's hilarious. I think proponents of drunk driving laws would point to the cases where that doesn't help, like if the drunk driver isn't cognizant enough to notice a red light and T-bones another car at full speed. The light wouldn't necessarily have helped in that case  🤷 I'd be curious to see if there is any country that implemented something more like this though, that would be an interesting experiment.</p>

        <p>By far it seems like most focus on seatbelts, but there is a smaller portion of people who realize that seatbelts are not a good analogy for their way of thinking about it, rather a better one is drunk driving. In that case, there are people who take action to prevent others from driving drunk. Drunk driving is another comparison that you'll have to find a rebuttal for.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don't think the seatbelt thing is even quite a good analogy for the reason they want to use it as well, since the only people who really get hurt from lack of seatbelt wearing is the person not wearing the seatbelt. If they were a little more thoughtful about it I think a better analogy pro-mandaters would use is drunk driving, since pro-mandaters are concerned both about one's own health plus the health of others, and drunk driving is much more likely to affect people other than the drunk driver as well. But there are a lot of other factors to consider, so it's also not totally the same.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Just say "What, you want people to die?" Bam, argument won. There's no room for nuance, and of course no one (at least not in the public eye) is ever going to say "Well, yes, it's a necessity."</p>

        <p>Seatbelts is easy. I wear one to protect myself, not others (unlike masks). But they don't understand that because they have the IQ of a banana.</p>
