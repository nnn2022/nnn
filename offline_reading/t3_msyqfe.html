    <strong>The "Smile-Friendly" Businesses List!</strong>
    <p><p>I encountered a lot of wonderful businesses today that welcome or at least don't get scared of seeing a smile or an uncovered face. I got to thinking, we should give our full support to those places that don't kick customers out for showing their smile.</p>
<p>Please Note... <strong><em>I am in Texas. Last month, Governor Abbott rescinded the statewide mask orders and included a ban on counties and municipalities to make their own ordinances that require masks. Mask rules are now left to the BUSINESS, not the government.</em></strong></p>
<p>These are the businesses I patronized today, that welcomed my smile and face. Note that results may vary by staff on duty and/or local laws and ordinances. For your submission to this list, please include only the name of the business, and the date that your smile was welcomed (or at least not dismissed). If you are in a "Free State" like Texas, feel free to list the city. If you are NOT in a free state, please list only "Big Box" or national chain stores, not small businesses... since the small family businesses stand to lose the most if a goon should rat them out.</p>
<p><strong><em>ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE IN DALLAS, TEXAS on April 17, 2021</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Albertson's</strong> <br>
<strong>Auto Zone</strong> <br>
<strong>Advance Auto Parts</strong> <br>
<strong>Dollar General</strong><br>
<strong>North Haven Gardens</strong><br>
<strong>Redenta's Nursery</strong> <br>
<strong>Taco Bueno</strong> </p>
<p>Let's keep this thread going and growing so that we can show our support for the sensible businesses and hard-working, customer-friendly employees who work there.</p>
<p>Some folks did express concerns that lists like these may make such businesses the target of local authorities and "goon squads". If you are in a non-free state, please think carefully before posting these. We want these businesses to remain, and we want to support them so that their employees and future employees can continue to support their families, and so on. We do not want to put anyone in harm's way.</p></p>

        <p>I'm in maine, and I'd suggest (unless the owners state otherwise) that businesses in locked down states not be listed. If they're doing so under the radar, outing them might end the behavior. If they want to get the word out, by all means support them!</p>
<p>Im still looking for restaurants in NH to support near the maine border, I'll bring my family and all our smiles!</p>

        <p>Not North Texas, but in the Austin suburbs I can confirm that Advance Auto Parts, Home Depot, HEB, Lowe's and Walmart all have mask signs but are not enforcing them. I have yet to find a local small business, especially a restaurant, that does not enforce masks.</p>

        <p>YES!! Lowes, HD, and HEB/Central Market are all smile-friendly. I echo that experience in North Texas.</p>
<p>Texas' Governor Abbott has rescinded statewide mask orders and has also issued an executive order prohibiting counties and municipalities from issuing local orders. It is solely up to the business as to whether to require masks or not.</p>
<p>As for small local businesses... Redenta's and North Haven are local, not chains.</p>

        <p>If he prohibited cities from making their own orders, Austin sure didn't get that memo.</p>

        <p>Oh, Austin got the memo all right. They just choose to ignore it. That's why Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit over the mask mandates, etc., only for some liberal   District Court  judge named Lora Livingston (Texas 261st District Court, a Democrat, go figure) to rule against him. That same judge ruled against Paxton and the State in a similar lawsuit around New Year's. Austin and Travis County do whatever the hell they feel like doing, and as long as a Travis County judge ... the same one... keeps taking these cases, nothing will change.</p>

        <p>please remember that there are a certain group of people out there looking for these lists specifically to cancel these businesses. It's already happened in my small rural town of 750 and the health inspectors were called in after they were bombarded with complaints from "concerned citizens" about stores not enforcing masks. As amazing as it is to share the businesses names to help them survive this, make an effort to do so privately and locally instead of on a huge public platform like this.</p>

        <p>Portlander and Blueparadise... good points. I edited my post, and now recommend that only people in Free States like Texas list specific businesses other than national chains, and to be careful when doing so if posting from a "Control State". However, DO continue to support Smile-Friendly businesses, and discreetly recommend them to others.</p>
<p>Thanks for that.</p>
