    <p><p>How much is too much?</p>
<p>At what point do you say "no"?</p>
<p>If you can't say no, what does that mean?</p>
<p>In my opinion, if you can't say no, you have no leverage and therefore no negotiating power whatsoever.</p>
<p>The strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must.</p>
<p>This is opinion and I am not an expert, so evaluate for yourself.  I do believe the virus is real, but I also suspect that a vaccine will not fare any better than our natural immune systems.  Vaccines only work because immune systems work.  If someone is extremely unhealthy, a vaccine that is unable to produce immunity will not offer much protection; perhaps symptom reduction: <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/10/27/covid-vaccine-trials.aspx">https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/10/27/covid-vaccine-trials.aspx</a></p>
<p>Mercola is a fringe health doctor, but he at least advocates freedom of choice.  The current paradigm is leaning towards government mandates of lockdown, technologies to track and restrict people <a href="https://covidpass.io/">https://covidpass.io/</a> , and pharmaceutical intervention with zero liability:  <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2020/08/03/577696.htm">https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2020/08/03/577696.htm</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, our economies are being strangled by lockdown and big players make loads of money while smaller businesses suffer.</p>
<p>Shutting down society is madness.  This is another step towards  authoritarianism.  In an era where people like calling the president a fascist, why would anyone want reasons to have an authoritarian  government validated?  When does this stop?  How much is too much? Do you trust Pharma to save us?  I don't, they have an established history  of bullshit via mental health meds and other bullshit meds that they endlessly peddle. The illusion of safety is the paddle with which we are  being trained.  There is no safety, only calculated risks.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Sweden seems to be doing fine.</p></p>

        <p>Couple of points. There is a virtually infinite number of viruses on this planet alone. If you start worrying about them you will lose your sanity. Besides they're part of evolution, without them life might not existed. The second point are the restrictions. Anything that it is imposed, mandated, enforced is basically a scam, because it doesn't really work.  Things that are truly essential for life are not dictated. Water or air they are not pushed. And feel free not to use them. So how comes that such a policy needs to be dictated in a democratic society? It's evident is useless. The only thing I see is control</p>
