    <strong>New worldwide movement needed</strong>
    <p><p>It seems to me that the current worldwide mass psychosis is a result of a new cult which clothes itself with fake science. This “science” is never to be questions and its tenets are to be taken as dogmatic fact. All those that dare question any of the so called “facts” or the reasoning behind them are branded “conspiracy theorists” (heretics) and are “canceled” (the modern “scientific” form of crucifixion).</p>
<p>Obviously traditional organized religion fell foul of those very same dogmatic traps which was the reason that the (then) newly emerged field of science found it such an easy target. The dogma of organized religion was just so obviously ridiculous that even a minimally educated person could see through the charade. The main business of the church was to make money, which even a cursory glance at the Vatican reveals was wildly successful. The new fake science religion is also all about making money. But the wealth is not so obviously displayed, this time being held by shareholders and bondholders.</p>
<p>Real actual science does a very good job of describing certain rules of the properties of <strong>physical matter</strong>. This is where its utility ends. It has no place whatsoever in the realms of the psyche. Neither has it anything to say about spirituality or consciousness. The implicit declaration by (so called) “science” that man is only a random conglomeration of matter which accidently came into being, to live out a chaotic haphazard life, the result of which is to return to nothingness, is not within its purview to make. This removes all hope from people as well as failing to address many well documented phenomena which completely disprove that fraudulent hypothesis.</p>
<p>Thus both religion and science have failed humankind miserably. It is my assertion that in order to undo the massive damage of the current dystopia that fake science has created, we need a new powerful movement to directly combat it and bring humanity back into the equation. Only religion currently has the numbers, adherents and clout to take on this new fake science cult. So what to do?</p>
<p>Einstein said that “It takes a different kind of thinking to solve a problem than the kind of thinking  that produced the problem”. Nobody can deny that he was a pretty cluey guy. We find ourselves in the midst of a mother of a problem which conventional thinking in both religion and science certainly helped create.</p>
<p>I believe there is good in both sides, but the saying “a pinch of truth in a pound of lies” applies equally to both. We need to extract the “pinch of truth” from both. Then the two parts of truth will combine to form a gestalt that adherents from the two camps will recognize as something to aspire to. The religious will see that the spiritual side of man is acknowledged, respected and not denied. The scientific will see that the fairy stories of old have been purged and their intelligence is not being insulted. We also need to take money completely out of the equation as it only distorts anything it comes in contact with. This would need to be something outside and above politics and commerce.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am being overly optimistic. However, I can't see any way out of the current ridiculous situation unless there is a union, synthesis and rebirth into a greater “philosophy” (or whatever name one would wish to use). There are many texts which point in this direction. It is certainly not my original idea by any means. But whatever happens, the “new normal” that appears to be developing is certainly disgusting, and not where I would wish to live.</p>
<p>[edit] After a few days, I am dismayed by the lack of interest. We appear to have a massive worldwide problem caused (in part) by conformist group-think. It is clear (maybe only) to me that we desperately need what Einstein said to fix this. Maybe in a few generations the penny might drop. Or maybe everyone is deleriously happy and I am naive to think it can change. </p></p>
