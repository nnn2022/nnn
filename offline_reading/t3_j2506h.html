    <strong>There is no getting through to them.</strong>
    <p><p>I've tried everything. Truly. I've tried reasoning, being kind, telling them this is not about anyone's health and that it is about compliance and power. They refuse to see it. They shout insults and 'Karen' and shame you instead of having an ounce of self-reflection. </p>
<p>It really doesn't matter how clearly you put it, that the government does not care about us, that the science on these masks has no merit (it says on the box that masks do not prevent the spread of coronavirus), it does nothing. They CHEER people being arrested for not wearing a mask. They cheer police harassment of innocent civilians trying to walk down the street in peace. They will cheer worse when the time comes.</p>
<p>I wish all of you strength and compassion in the coming times. I fear things are not going to improve. Most people's minds are made up and set in stone. Stay strong everyone and be as kind as possible, for your own soul's sake. </p>
<p>Bless.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, most people disagree with you. Not because you are "enlightened" but because you fail to see the basics because you are already firmly entrenched in this worldview. You probably believe the Q movement as well. I would bet money on you at least putting some stock into that.</p>
<p>There are people who know enough about the natural world to allow scientists to do their thing and make recommendations. And then there are people who assume scientists and everyone else is out to fuck them over. All evidence whos that is wrong as hell. it is a possibility, sure. But all you are doing is buying into everything that fits your worldview.</p>
<p>In fact we all do that. I would argue that certain worldviews are absolutely more correct than others, though. Guess who's worldview is based on paranoia, and ignorance? It's certainly not mine.</p>

        <p>I’m not a QAnon person. I’m literally a left-leaning independent. The lockdowns have killed more people than they’ve saved and done more harm than good, that’s not a controversial worldview, or even one based in paranoia and ignorance. If you are legitimately scared of COVID-19, then that is based in paranoia and ignorance. Pretty ironic lol</p>

        <p>Im not scared of corona. Not at all. Wearing a mask, washing my hands, and trying as best I can not breathe in anyones fumes is a simple and effective solution. Why be afraid of something we can't control? I assure you I don't wear a mask out of fear. I wear it because it is not hard to wear one, and it makes logical fucking sense.</p>
<p>The lockdowns happened worldwide. It was not a ploy by the US government to gain more control over it's citizens. We are not in lockdown anymore. We are limited in a few minor ways but that's it. There's nothing to fear, really. Just wear the damn mask, use your brain, and go about you day.</p>

        <p>I wash my hands, but that’s basic hygiene and you should do it whether you’re in a pandemic or not. I don’t wear a mask because it makes absolutely no logical sense from either a scientific biological standpoint nor from a practical pragmatic one. </p>
<p>No, my region is not really in lockdown anymore, which I’m deeply thankful for. However, my family lives in a part of Canada which is considering locking back down due to a rise in cases, and everyday I fear for their well-being, financial situation, and mental health.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask is the epitome of not using your brain. The science doesn't support it. The real-world data doesn't support it. You have turned your brain off and accepted masks without any evidence to them being at all helpful.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns happened because of Chinese propaganda, number one. (Michael P. Senger has fascinating, horrifying Twitter threads and articles about this.) We never did this before, because it was never considered a tool in the kit so to speak. We never did it for a reason. Not even for viruses far worse than this one. It was considered anathema to how to handle a pandemic. Now we do it because China did it. We destroyed SOCIETY. Whole industries. People are thrown into permanent poverty. Millions will die of starvation.</p>
<p>We are in lockdown in many places. Look at what's going on in Victoria, Australia, the UK, California where we are still LOCKED UP, and so on.</p>

        <p>You need to learn to stop putting people into boxes. People are multifaceted and believe many different things. You instantly lose once you try and put fake beliefs in people’s mouths, all it does is show you have nothing left to go on except trying to discredit someone else.</p>

        <p>Like some other commenter said, it's most likely children with nothing else to do piling on. They have nothing to do so this is their main source of entertainment for the day. And like you do with any children, you just ignore them and they'll go away to do something else (most likely their homework).</p>

        <p>Because it is dumb as shit. Yeah, the masks are more for other people's safety than your own. MY FREEDOM isn't as important as your life. Imma wear my mask just in case. I may be asymptomatic. And while you may be in your prime and healthy as can be, you might spread it to your grandma, and boom. The mask is a huge inconvenience to me, but I think that it is worth it.</p>

        <p>So actually, the story is a bit more complicated. I have a friend who works for the CDC and he's hinted that the mask mandates are actually a reverse psyop. Liberals and the media get their followers to wear masks, so they can spread their tracking chips via 5G directly into the lungs of real hardworking patriotic americans. They will probably be spraying those chips for another 2-3 months. People make fun of me for wearing a mask but I'll be the last one laughing when Biden/Soros/the Obama foundation are tracking your every move.</p>

        <p>They put those warnings so they don't get sued in the event that the user does not properly wear the mask and contracts the virus.</p>
<p>Proper filtration grade masks can capture particles as small as 0.3µm. The virus particles range in sizes from 0.06 µm - 0.14 µm, however, they bind to liquid particles such as your saliva. This is why these masks are in fact extremely effective. </p>

        <p>So what happens to the virus particles when the liquid evaporates? They stay stuck onto the mask fibers that are commonly spewed off or inhaled? Or they just stay in the mask without still being suspended in liquid droplets, even though you just admitted that there's  plenty of space for them to be expelled through the fabric?</p>

        <p>Sorry, but the science doesn't not support your conclusion. Masks have shown to have no measurable impact on slowing the spread of this disease. Almost without exception, every place on earth that has mandated masks has seen no slowing of viral spread. Trajectories have not flattened. Masks are not extremely effective. They haven't been effective in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Wisconsin, Illinois, Maryland, Virginia, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, France, Spain, UK, Belgium, Italy, Morocco, UAE, India, Indonesia, The Philippines, Japan, and countless other places. The fact that people keep regurgitating this notion that masks are effective is beyond absurd. The numbers clearly show this, yep people keep clinging onto the lie that masks work. Sorry, they don't.</p>

        <p>Ok, so let's look at the US states that you mentioned because I don't have time to write a novel to explain all other countries. If masks are worn correctly, they are extremely effective. The issue begins when people do not wear their masks correctly. Another large issue in the US is how many of it's residents have not been taking COVID seriously, and will host parties regardless of mandates put into place to protect its citizens. Look at Canada for example. We reduced the number of daily cases via mask mandates, social gathering size limits, and shutting down parts of the economy. The only reason that our cases have spiked again is that school is back (and kids don't keep their masks on) and because people are starting to ignore the government mandates. Masks are proven scientifically to work, I'd like to see some factual evidence disproving the effectiveness of masks.</p>

        <p>Ok, let's look at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/cYmLWQT">Canada</a>. As you can see, mask wearing has had zero impact on Canada's numbers. The virus spread rapidly throughout April, peaking on May 4th, and without any masks, the number of cases plummeted (and this was as things were starting to open back up even). Mask mandates didn't really happen in Canada until Mid July. And as you can see, regardless of mask wearing, the cases have steadily increased at a similar rate as they did in April. So how on earth are you coming to the conclusion that Masks were effective in Canada? By what metric are you making that judgement? But of course, instead of admitting that the policy may be flawed, you have to resort to blaming people for not doing it correctly or enough. But studies <a href="https://theconversation.com/canada-is-not-immune-to-the-politics-of-coronavirus-masks-144110">show</a> that 83 per cent of Canadians currently wear masks as part of their normal routine. </p>
<p>So how have you come to the conclusion that masks are proven scientifically to work? How was this proven? When was it proven? Who proved it? I am fairly confident you have never actually researched the subject are are just parroting what you have been told. Here are a few studies showing that masks are ineffective:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/ - This one is an actual study where they separated healthcare workers into two different groups for a few months, one group wore masks, the other didn't. 
Conclusion: " Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds. A larger study is needed to definitively establish noninferiority of no mask use"</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x - This one is a summary of a bunch of studies. 
Conclusion: "None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask ⁄ respirator use and protection against inﬂuenza infection."</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747 - This is another analysis of thousands of published studies. Conclusion: Here are some highlights - "Our analysis confirms the effectiveness of medical masks and respirators against SARS. Disposable, cotton, or paper masks are not recommended." , "single-use medical masks are preferable to cloth masks, for which there is no evidence of protection and which might facilitate transmission of pathogens when used repeatedly without adequate sterilization" , "We found no clear benefit of either medical masks or N95 respirators against pH1N1" , "Overall, the evidence to inform policies on mask use in HCWs is poor".</p>
<p>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20200911-sweden-s-chief-epidemiologist-we-are-happy-with-our-strategy-on-covid-19 - This is just an interview with Anders Tegnell, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, talking about the science behind masks being very weak (it's around the 7 minute mark). </p>
<p>I could share many more with you. The point is that the science behind masks is very weak and there certainly is no consensus on the subject. But at this point, what we do have, is a bunch of real-world data from nations around the world where mask wearing has been mandated for months. And what does this data show us? You'd think if masks had been proven to work, that we would be able to see their impact in the places where people have been wearing masks. Here are a bunch of example from around the world:</p>

<p>United Arab Emirates - https://imgur.com/FkirVl5</p>
<p>Israel - https://imgur.com/Gv0l6wC</p>
<p>Canada - https://imgur.com/3XypjFZ</p>
<p>If you go through all of these examples, you will clearly see that masks have had no measurable impact on slowing the spread of Sars-Cov-2. This is the case, almost without exception. And then when you have places like Sweden that had no mask mandate, and still have seen a dramatic decrease in <a href="https://imgur.com/CIbIyhe">cases</a>, it becomes more obvious that masks don't actually work at all and are relatively pointless. </p>
<p>What has led you to believe so deeply in the effectiveness of masks? There is plenty of peer reviewed science that says that masks are not effective. There are plenty of experts that don't think masks are effective. Pretty much all the real world data shows that masks are not effective. So why is that you are so committed to the idea that masks work? It's very strange. is there some study that you have seen that is exceptionally convincing? Is there a place on Earth that definitively shows masks working? I'd love to know how you've gotten to a place where you are so converted to masks that you go online and defend them and try to convince others to join your religion. It truly is fascinating.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When removing a face covering, you should grab it by the elastic straps and not touch the mask at all. It should then be disposed of in a garbage bin and not on the ground. If masks are properly used, they are extremely effective.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns have not prevented deaths. Where is your evidence that lockdowns prevent death? They were imposed, and are still in place throughout many places in the world, and regardless 1 million people have still died. Lockdowns do not prevent deaths, at best they delay them. This was common knowledge in march. Lockdowns were meant to flatten the curve, not reduce the number of deaths. The death toll was always going to be the same, flattening the curve was about spreading the same number of deaths over a longer period of time so as not to overwhelm healthcare infrastructure. You are terribly misinformed if you believe that the goal of lockdowns is to prevent deaths. The fact that we are 6 months into this and you still are so confused is pretty sad.</p>

        <p>Yeah idk why they don’t realize the only true lasting effects from this will hopefully be that wearing masks during flu season or when sick will be normalized here like it is in Asian countries, and hopefully that stores like Costco keep early hours for the elderly and immunocompromised to make their everyday shopping easier. The people in this sub are the same ones that think this will lead to the government forcing us to wear hijabs (oops I said the quiet part out loud). Also nice wearing is caring award bro.</p>

<p>I’m curious what did the elderly and compromised do before covid 19? Surely the flu, H1N1 or other viruses and diseases would be deadly to them but we never adjusted society as a whole for it. It was personal responsibility</p>

        <p>Yeah except those viruses did not become a world wide plague like COVID has, makes sense why they didn’t really change anything here. And in Japan and Korea and all those countries masks are commonly worn as a preventative as well, but I have no problem if people wear them when they’re already sick as that still reduces the likely hood of me catching it even if I’m not wearing one. Also god forbid we learn something from this pandemic and realize as a society maybe offering our weak a safe place to shop for food is maybe not such a terrible idea?</p>

        <p>Nah I won’t be. Those so called children have been in hospitals able to receive their treatment, you just keep reading made up articles about it. The medical industry has long been at the forefront of mandatory cleaning procedures and to them wearing masks comes naturally since they’re not idiots. If anything, shutting down has saved those children as the immense reduction in patients has kept the hospitals from being overrun, those children still have access to healthcare heroes because those doctors and nurses aren’t busy treating mask denying idiots like you. This shut down has saved millions, it’s effectiveness has made idiots like you think this was blown out of proportion, but if we hadn’t Tahiti down we’d be seeing death tolls in the tens of millions already. So don’t try to use children as an excuse for your looney thoughts, the scientists working to control this that you demonize so much are the angels god sent to save so their work, idiots like you have fallen prey to the devil and his onslaught of misinformation.</p>

        <p>I have, many times over. Have you considered how we feel? Because all I have gotten from the pro mask, pro lock down side are insults and threats. Someone here called me subhuman garbage. It doesn't bother me personally, I feel for them but it worries me because we are being dehumanized. That is dangerous territory. </p>

        <p>See that is what you believe but it doesn't make it true. It's so amazing that a great swath of humanity suddenly became 'subhuman scum' just because of a narrative told to you by the media. That is all you are going on. In March masks were useless. I'll have you know I was the first one to wear one in my town back in March when this first hit. Then I learned what was really going on. </p>
<p>Just keep hurling insults though and dehumanizing people who disagree with you, it's your conscience not mine.</p>

<p>Remember don't touch your face!? Now touch your face all day long as you get up from your restaurant table and have to put your mask back on so you can touch the bathroom doorknob and everything else on your way. It's so contradictory I can't even fathom people are still buying it. </p>
<p>Now if I am actually sick, sure I'm not going to leave the damn house, but having healthy people walk about in any damn face covering because 'reasons' 24/7 with risk of arrest and fines is flat out tyranny. You will never convince me otherwise.</p>

        <p>Thats how science works, as we discover new things we try to learn from it, like how masks can help protect people. You can see with these scientific articles on masks.</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

&rt;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h694.abstract">Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.

&rt;&rt;Adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk of ILI‐associated infection, with a hazard ratio of 0·26 (95% CI 0·09–0·77; P = 0·015). A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

        <p>Thanks for posting actual sources instead of just shouting insults. This is how we get somewhere. </p>
<p>After reading over these, I have to say, I see a lot of scientific jargon in the vein of 'suggest' 'may' and 'could' in terms of any conclusions regarding mask wearing and preventing coronavirus spread. </p>
<p>Now here is another bunch of studies from the other perspective, with equally vague conclusions. (see below) The point is, if the science is still out on masks, inconclusive or what have you, then why the HELL are people being legitimately arrested, harassed, refused service, and fined for not wearing them? This is the issue I have contention with. I still wear them, I don't mind not breathing on strangers, I social distance and I act courteous and wash my damn hands. </p>
<p>But it is the government overreach that infuriates me and everyone else on this sub. We see this encroaching authoritarian nightmare occurring under the guise of helping and saving lives. I don't know, if you can't see that, then we just don't see eye to eye but I will keep trying to explain what the real issue is here.</p>
<p>Review of the Medical Literature Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., “N95”) does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p>Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) “Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,” American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 – 419. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002</a></p>
<p>N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>
<p>Cowling, B. et al. (2010) “Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review,” Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic-</a> review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05</p>
<p>None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.</p>
<p>bin-Reza et al. (2012) “The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence,” Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257–267. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</a></p>
<p>“There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”</p>
<p>Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,” CMAJ Mar 2016 <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567">https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567</a></p>
<p>“We identified six clinical studies … . In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism.”</p>
<p>Offeddu, V. et al. (2017) “Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,” Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages 1934–1942, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</a></p>
<p>“Self-reported assessment of clinical outcomes was prone to bias. Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection (VRI) was not statistically significant”; as per Fig. 2c therein:</p>
<p>Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019) “N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial,” JAMA. 2019; 322(9): 824–833. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214</a></p>
<p>“Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. ... Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>
<p>Long, Y. et al. (2020) “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis,” J Evid Based Med. 2020; 1- 9. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381</a></p>
<p>“A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>
<p>Conclusion Regarding That Masks Do Not Work No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. You can download the full paper here. Save it because it is being scrubbed.</p>

<p>&rt;The knowledge that there is no such thing as a scientific proof should give you a very easy way to tell real scientists from hacks and wannabes. Real scientists never use the words “scientific proofs,” because they know no such thing exists. Anyone who uses the words “proof,” “prove,” and “proven” in their discussion of science is not a real scientist.</p>
<p>None of the studys you posted mentiond covid, nore did they test for it, except for the last one but that is not a peer reviewed source and is a broken link.</p>

        <p>Studies show the opposite. If you actually looked at the studies, you would know this. Most studies show that masks are not effective at preventing the spread of viruses. And the real world data from mask usage around the world overwhelmingly shows that masks make no difference in viral spread. You have accepted that masks work, but certainly have never read the science behind it, and definitely have never actually looked at the actual data. What has you so convinced that masks work? Which studies have you read that have given you so much confidence in their effectiveness? Be specific. Which country's mask policy and results have made you such a firm believer in masks?</p>

        <p>Ok, lets look at your links.</p>
<p>Link 1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191274/
So this was not really a study. Here is what they did: "A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms." They basically searched key words from Mediline and Embase, and drew their own conclusions based on the articles that their search pulled up. When you look at their conclusion, the language they chose to use is very telling. Here are some of the highlights: "The study suggests", "could be beneficial", "where transmission may be pre-symptomatic", "suggest a benefit", "may be important", "may prevent health worker infections". This is far from convincing language. This is not a test or experiment. They just used a medical search engine to find articles about masks and respirators. </p>
<p>Link 2. https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/06/stanford-scientists-contribute-to-who-mask-guidelines.html
This was a Q&amp;A done in mid June. This is not a study and is nothing more than an opinion piece. And it was written when the vast majority of mask mandates were first being enacted. </p>
<p>Link 3. https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083
This is a study that shows how masks can block droplets. This is not a debated issue. Very few people doubt that masks can block droplets. Just because a mask can block droplets does not mean that it actually slows the spread of viruses, since there are many other factors that go into why masks are not effective at slowing viral spread. </p>
<p>Link 4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115281/
Here is the conclusion from this study: "None of these surgical masks exhibited adequate filter performance and facial fit characteristics to be considered respiratory protection devices."</p>
<p>Link 5. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15459624.2016.1225157
This is a study about filtration efficiency of N95 masks. It's not really a study about how masks prevent the spread of viruses. The study basically concluded that N95 masks are better than surgical masks (mainly in blocking larger particles). That is pretty much common knowledge and hardly controversial. Here's a excerpt from their conclusion: "However, previous studies with approximately similar size FFRs and SMs showed significantly higher penetrations or lower efficiencies for SMs.[25,28,38] Products with poor or mediocre filtration performance such as the SM models in this study can be consistently identified using only a more challenging method such as the NIOSH NaCl method used for NIOSH certification of particulate respirators. This confirms earlier reports from other laboratories,[37,39] and ours on SMs,[40] non-NIOSH certified dust masks,[41] and cloth masks.[42]</p>
<p>Your links do not support your conclusion about masks. I am fairly confident you have never actually read the articles you posted. 
Here are a few more relevant studies that conclude that masks are not effective at reducing viral spread:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/
This one is an actual study where they separated healthcare workers into two different groups for a few months, one group wore masks, the other didn't.
Conclusion: " Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds. A larger study is needed to definitively establish noninferiority of no mask use"</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x
This one is kinda like your first link. It was a summary of a bunch of studies.
Conclusion: "None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask ⁄ respirator use and protection against inﬂuenza infection." </p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747
This is another analysis of thousands of published studies. 
Conclusion: Here are some highlights - "Our analysis confirms the effectiveness of medical masks and respirators against SARS. Disposable, cotton, or paper masks are not recommended." , "single-use medical masks are preferable to cloth masks, for which there is no evidence of protection and which might facilitate transmission of pathogens when used repeatedly without adequate sterilization" , "We found no clear benefit of either medical masks or N95 respirators against pH1N1" , "Overall, the evidence to inform policies on mask use in HCWs is poor". </p>
<p>The point of all of this is that the science behind the effectiveness of masks is very weak. <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20200911-sweden-s-chief-epidemiologist-we-are-happy-with-our-strategy-on-covid-19">Here</a> is an interview with Anders Tegnell, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, who talks about the evidence behind mask wearing being very weak (around the 7 minute mark). Yes there are studies that show that masks are effective, but there are just as many that show that they aren't. And most of the studies that I have read about masks being effective, go out of their way to say their effectiveness is minimal. But ultimately, the real-world data is much more important at this point. Mask wearing has been mandated throughout the world for months. And what does the data show? Here are some examples:</p>

<p>I could go on and on. The data we have from mask wearing throughout the world supports the conclusion that masks have no measurable impact on slowing the spread of Covid-19. Why are you so convinced that they work? Not sure what small town you live in that has only had 7 cases since March, but the fact that you actually think that those low numbers are due to a strict mask mandate is, in your words, retarded.</p>

        <p>Are you seriously comparing drunk driving laws to mask mandates? Drunk driving laws affect a tiny number of people who choose to drink too much alcohol and then choose to drive a car. There are very few people that will argue that being drunk doesn't effect their driving. There is ample data showing that alcohol impairs driving ability. </p>
<p>Mask mandates are imposed upon everyone. My children can't go to school without wearing a mask. Healthy people are required to wear masks everywhere. And the science behind wearing masks is all over the place. There are studies on both sides of the argument, but most actually show that masks have little to no impact on preventing viral spread. And the actual numbers from countless countries around the world that have had mask mandates in place for months clearly show that mask wearing has no measurable impact on slowing the spread of covid. </p>
<p>Your comparison is extremely weak and makes little sense. Passing laws to protect people is not the issue. Pretty much every law is there to ultimately protect people. But passing laws, that are not based on evidence, science or data, and doing it via executive emergency orders, is a problem. It's a dangerous precedent and should not be celebrated or promoted. Drunk driving laws have near universal support and are not controversial. Mask mandates are hated by millions of people (including scientists, doctors, national health institutions, epidemiologists, experts, etc), don't make much sense, and have very little evidence that supports their effectiveness.</p>

        <p>Which would make sense if we're as deadly as they initially said it was. "Two weeks to flatten the curve" = same number of people get infected but hospitals aren't "overrun". Most weren't and aren't going to be because it's way less deadly than initially thought and we have better treatment plans now.</p>

        <p>If we could perfectly lockdown forever, I guess lockdowns could in theory be considered effective. But lockdowns, in reality, objectively do not work. Once restrictions are inevitably lifted, the virus will continue to spread. This has been proven time and time again throughout the world. Covid has spread freely throughout the world regardless of whatever measures humans have foolishly tried to enact. In fact, when it was the most deadly was actually during the most strict period of lockdowns (early spring). How many places have to conclusively show that lockdowns don't work until you people accept reality? And even if lockdowns do slow the spread, they are not "free". The economic, emotional, psychological, mental, physical, toll that lockdowns take is far worse than covid could ever dream of being.</p>

        <p>In some places they fucking were with police prowling the streets and even the military to make sure you didn't violate your one hour allowed to leave the fucking house! In the majority of the world people have lost their jobs, businesses, anything that brought them joy. Industries are decimated permanently. Kids cannot go to school. We cannot worship our chosen faith if we have one. I love how you guys think none of that matters and we can just keep on this way permanently, but you won, so whatever. Enjoy your basement.</p>

<p>Also, you may be waiting to say "ACTUALLY THE FLU LAST YEAR KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN COVID"</p>
<p>But that's just not true. The reason that number comes up is because the flu is listed as the lone cause of death, while covid is listed alongside  other things like lung failure or respiratory failure. This means that the covid deaths, and the deaths caused by covid are two different  numbers (the latter being the accurate number, as it includes ALL deaths related to covid)</p>
<p>So yeah. Not exactly like the flu.</p>

        <p>IFR is not the percentage of the population that will die.  It is the percentage of <em>infected</em> population which will die.  Herd immunity dictates that not all of a population will be infected.  In the case of COVID, herd immunity thresholds may begin as low as 20% infected.</p>

        <p>Why? Are you under the assumption that people don't die? What is an acceptable number for you? You have arbitrarily chosen .6% as some unacceptable number, but it doesn't really make any sense due to the fact that every human will eventually die of one thing or another. Why are you fixated on covid? It is bizarre.</p>
