    <strong>If masks do work so well, then why are countries with extremely high mask compliance, still having cases?</strong>
    <p><p>I am honestly open to having my mind changed about this. </p>
<p>Just had a quick search through journals and haven't found particularly compelling evidence for use of masks, especially outside healthcae settings. They all seem to day we need better studies/ more evidence. Where are countries/governments getting the evidence from that masks work?</p></p>

        <p>I’m ready for the downvotes, but I still want to know how you think masks control people? It doesn’t make sense to me. Face masks have been used in Asia (mostly at least) for normal colds and flus for ages before the pandemic, were they being controlled too?</p>

        <p>It’s a visual reminder to be afraid of the deadly pandemic around all of us and trust our politicians for they will surely save us.  Were it not for the constant reminder most of us would probably go on and forget about Covid (because while it’s there most who get and know about it don’t get very sick and for the few who do and perish it would be a topic of tragedy but not national security).  It anonymizes people and keeps them from making meaningful connections with other people and talking/organizing against the mandates-as in why do you think strip clubs were allowed to be open in many places but not churches?  Because our leaders can’t have people talking and sharing the ever growing opinion that this is more about control and we don’t need this draconian “protection”.</p>

        <p>It's only the sick who typically wear masks in those countries. They're also worn in cities with massive pollution problems. The healthy aren't expected to wear masks like the lunacy we've been seeing in recently. There has been zero evidence that healthy people wearing masks provide any benefit.</p>

        <p>Well, the main benefit of masks is that the people who are sick but don’t feel like it don’t spread the virus. Covid has a long incubation period compared to other diseases, which means someone can feel fine but still be contagious.</p>
<p>But you didn’t answer my question. How is it bad that non-sick people are wearing masks, even if they aren’t contagious?</p>

        <p>I have 3 main issues with masks.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We're constantly told that "masks work". Those 2 words are repeated constantly, but neither of those words are defined. Are we saying that an N95 mask could help prevent an infected person for spreading the disease? Or are we saying that any face covering whatsoever is fine and if we all just put one on the virus will be gone in a matter of weeks. As far as I can tell, the messaging tends to lean towards the latter. It's very common to hear "The longer you don't wear your mask, the longer we'll be dealing with the virus." That just isn't true and there's no effort made to clarify what the masks are supposed to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While they should help prevent the spread in theory, most people are just wearing some kind of cloth bullshit, pulling them down to sneeze, adjusting them, not washing them, reusing them, etc. They also provide a false sense of security. They can only really slow the spread at best if everyone wears them correctly, but people don't know that. Someone who is at-risk could go into a restaurant, wear it to their table and think they're completely fine, and we've been told that it's safe to do so. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They're mandated in places that don't make sense. Why should you be fined or assaulted for not wearing one walking by yourself outside? Why should restaurants and bars be forced to make you wear one while you're standing up? To keep at-risk people protected to some degree, wouldn't it make more sense to mandate them at doctor's offices, grocery stores and pharmacies rather than saying "you can't be outside without a mask." </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These reasons combined are why I see the masks as a way for governments to cover their asses than an actual public health solution. There's no strategy with the masks, the messaging is unclear and constantly changing and no one is allowed to question it.</p>
<p>Lastly, when you talk about a place where everyone wears a mask, like Japan, you have to remember a few things.</p>
<p>The government where I live in the US blames cases on people not wearing masks constantly. The city I live in has some of the most mask-compliant people I've ever seen, but we've always had the highest case percentage in the state. They wear it outside by themselves, in my apartment building, in every store, etc. I have to idea what mask compliance is like in say, Kyoto, but they could have "anti-maskers" just like any other country.</p>
<p>Japan has a 3% obesity rate while the US has a 30% obesity rate. For that reason, people who catch covid in Japan are far less likely to be symptomatic. And an asymptomatic person is less likely to go get a test.</p>
<p>The US has tested more people (flat number) than any country in the world. Japan has 65 covid tests per 1000 population while the US has 1045 tests per 1000 population. The US is testing healthy people for traces of a virus that isn't making them sick. We make some college kids get tested twice per week. We are constantly scraping the bottom of the barrel to bring up more cases.</p>

        <p>Interesting take on the topic, especially how it's perceived in the US. I'm from Austria and it seems like there are big differences.
1. it was always clear masks don't simply "work", they are supposed to help and how much depends on the type of mask. So cloth&lt;surgical&lt;N95. That's how it was communicated.
2. Because N95 masks are now widely available here, they're the only ones allowed. So no more people having a thin part of cloth in front of their mouth. The vast majority of people also manage to wear them correctly.
3. They're mandated only in places that make sense, so in all the examples you listed. I wear a mask for an average of 5 minutes a day, so that's the aspect of the lockdown that bothers me the least.</p>
<p>While our government still lacks a few communication skills, especially regarding their strategy for the future, it seems like less of a chaos than it is in the US.</p>

        <p>In my state, you have to wear them to go in any business. Some places near me have city mandates, so you have to wear one walking outside. I'm also supposed to wear one in the hallways of my apartment, in the parking garage and in any common area. Gyms also require them while exercising. If I leave my apartment without one on, I'm technically an anti-masker.</p>

        <p>I kind of envy you. Here in Spain masks are mandatory where you can't maintain social distance.. which means everywhere. So you have to wear it on the street, in every store and if you're having a drink outside (the only way), you are expected to do the "lower your mask/drink/put your mask up ect.."</p>
<p>It's interesting that in Austria only a certain type of mask is mandated, here it's anything you want. Compliance is very high where I am but "cases" are still very high. That's why we have a 10pm curfew.. <em>sigh</em></p>

        <p>Well we are still in quite a lockdown, so there is not too much to envy about us. But I doubt this will go on much longer as the deaths are decreasing even though the cases are increasing, so quite unsurprisingly vaccinating the people at risk helps at that. </p>
<p>But I have to admit that I'm not as critical of my government and corona in general as this sub is.    So I don't believe there is a big conspiracy, our whole situation can be pretty much accounted to people being dumb, and not malicous.</p>

        <p>It does sound like your country is not going overboard with lockdown restrictions, especially compared to others. Ireland for example, has had one of the lowest death rates in europe and yet has had one of the harshest lockdowns (5km travel limit, limit on the number of people who can visit your house, not being able to buy non-essential items ect..) and for me it's very hard to not consider it malicious. I think that so many of these policies make no logical sense if the idea is to keep the death rate low. But that's just my opinion.</p>
<p>I do hope you are right and that it doesn't continue much longer. Can I ask when you think lockdowns and mask mandates should be lifted in your country? It's impossible to give a date of course, but under what conditions do you think it should end completely? Has your government talked about that at all?</p>

        <p>Well that's hard to say. What I believe will happen is that we'll gradually open up with mandated testing if you wanna go to a concert for example. (testing is free and quite efficient in our country, we have plenty of testing sites and it takes about 2 minutes) When enough people are vaccinated this will also fall. This is also what I think should happen.</p>
<p>So basically ease all restrictions in a way that the daily deaths don't rise again. This largely depends on the vaccination rate of course.</p>
<p>As an absolute maximum for any restrictions I'd take the date where anyone has had the chance to get vaccinated. This is planned to be in summer, but most of the restrictions will be gone by then so don't interpret this as me believing this will go on till summer.</p>

<p>Numbers are slightly different between the 2 sources. It doesnt mean that every single citizen is getting tested more than once. It means that some citizens (hospital workers, college students, etc) are being tested with high frequency. I've never been tested, but my cousin who is an ER driver is tested weekly.</p>

<p>The evidence that masks "work" are based on very limited studies like "there was this restaurant dinner where 50% the people without masks got infected and only 25% of the people with masks, so they work."</p>

        <p>There is a huge part of science and medicine about proving something in the lab and them showing it works in the real world.  They created computer simulations to show masks have some efficacy. Of course, if you release a simulation showing masks don't work all your funding would be taken away.  But then if you look at real world data mask seem to have no positive effect. </p>
<p>You can argue why that is.  People touch their masks too much cancelling any benefits?  But they don't work.</p>

        <p>The science is being manipulated for political and financial gain, it's clearly evident at this point. Yes the virus is real but it's been grossly over-exaggerated and the same billionaires are the ones profiteering on the back of this nightmare whilst the common man and woman (or whatever you wanna identify as) suffer in the short and long term.</p>
<p>People seem to forget science and certain political narratives can be bought and swayed with the right financial buying power. Why have we forgotten this?</p>
<p>Plus we've got the woke virtue signallers that are extending this nightmare even further for a few Facebook likes and kudos on Twitter.</p>
<p>Lockdowns set a precedent for the future, government can take your liberty at a whim and force you to do something against your will in order for you to regain them. In this case vaccinations.</p>
<p>Why nobody can see how dangerous this precedent is for the future of our children really bewilders me.</p>

        <p>The issue with this argument is that you're assuming masks prevent transmission. This has never been the case. </p>
<p>Masks mitigate transmission. That means that some people will still get sick, just a fewer number.</p>
<p>Would you ever think, "Hmm, people still die in automobile accidents. Why do people think airbags and seat belts work?"</p>
<p>Probably not, because that would be ridiculous. Safety precautions are almost always about mitigation, not prevention.</p>

        <p>The issue is there is empirical evidence to make the case that things like airbags and seatbelts have the type of impact that you're talking about, ie, airbags started to become more broadly implemented in the 70s/80s and you see a drop off begin to occur in deaths per capita to substantiate their effectiveness.

        <p>South Korea and Japan aren’t having no where near as many cases as the US and UK. I don’t know what data you’re looking at but I’d look again.</p>
<p>If you admit there’s evidence for use in healthcare settings, why wouldn’t it work outside? Healthcare workers are more used to wearing masks, and doing so properly, so there’s a reason it’s better in those settings. How many people have you seen pull the mask below their nose? Pull it down to cough or sneeze their hand? Pull it down to talk to someone?</p>
<p>Wondering why masks aren’t working as well for the general public is like wondering why home tattooers give people infections when they don’t sanitize anything correctly.</p>

        <p>Exactly. What they don't do is protect anyone from the fine mist but that contains less viruses than snot. On the other hand, the mist stays airborne longer and is inhaled no matter what silly mask you have. I'm not even sure that a N95 or even a gas mask will do the trick. There's a good reason the researchers have pressurized suits to handle contagious samples.</p>

        <p>Sounds good to me. But by just breathing normally, we don't release a lot of anything else than air and a little bit of water vapor. But I can absolutely see that any activity gets the airflow up enough to spew out particles where viruses can stick to. And the kind that bypasses any mask commonly used.</p>

        <p>Which is it then? Is there not a difference compared to other comment, or is it just about N95s? Or are you saying N95s don’t work? </p>
<p>Edit: Excuse me, the other comment was by another user with a w username.</p>
