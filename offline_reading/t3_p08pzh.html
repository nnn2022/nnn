    <strong>What vitamins and health foods do you take?</strong>
    <p><p>Earlier in the life of this sub, it was much more common to see posts about health, staying healthy and keeping your immune system strong. I thought it would be cool to bring that back.</p>
<p>What vitamins, supplements, health foods or superfoods do you take/swear by/recommend?</p>
<p>Note, I am NOT asking for supposed COVID cures. I’m asking what you take for general health.</p></p>

        <p>Depends. Vitamins/supplements could be useful if your diet is not super clean. But if you eat very clean food they become unnecessary and even detrimental. </p>
<p>I strive for PURITY:</p>
<p>That means distilled water, raw nuts, fruits, berries and vegetables when possible. Cooking is okay sometimes but you need living foods because the enzymes and bacteria are important for your gut flora. Your body can’t assimilate dead (cooked) cells as easily and most of it is waste material. Raw eggs are great but softly poached or softly scrambled is okay if raw bothers your stomach. </p>
<p>Avoid grains and legumes entirely, including corn and rice if you can. Basically a paleo diet with as much raw fruit, eggs and veggies as you can. </p>
<p>Avoid all CHEMICALS in your food. Look at ingredients, and if something is there that isn’t FOOD, then don’t eat it. This includes BS like “natural flavors” (not food) and conola oil and any kind of starches. </p>
<p>More importantly, avoid all chemicals on your body, including deodorants (heavy metals absorbing into your skin), toothpastes (petro chemicals and other harsh chemicals), shampoo/conditioner, perfume and makeup, laundry detergents and fabric softeners (use castille soap), kitchen cleaners and sprays (use water or vinegar). Basically, avoid toxic shit! All of it! That’s what really makes you sick... not some invisible germ floating around in the air. Remember: PURITY!</p>
<p>That is how I live. I haven’t so much as had a sniffle in years.</p>

        <p>Only eat whole foods/produce. If it comes in a package there's probably other ingredients such as preservatives. So be careful what you buy, and try to stick to whole, organic, fresh fruits and vegetables and eggs. Eggs should be organic and pasture raised if you can find them, and meat should be organic and grass fed if you can. Organic grass-fed butter is a god-send, especially if you can find RAW butter (it can get pretty expensive). One thing I forgot to mention: DAIRY can be trouble, so be careful with how much you consume (butter is an exception... go crazy).</p>
<p>If you're not used to eating like this, it can be very inconvenient at first (and expensive). It's so much easier to just grab a bag of chips when you want a snack. But if you stick with it you find it gets pretty easy. I like to make smoothies in the morning with avocado, strawberries, blueberries, and fresh squeezed (unpasteurized) OJ. I'll even crack a raw egg in there and it's a solid meal in 5 minutes. For snacking I like macadamia nuts, sauerkraut, or chopped rainbow carrots. I also love to eat celery with almond or cashew butter. You just gotta find the things you like and stick to them!</p>
<p>Sometimes there's things you can't avoid or situations where you have to make an exception (like if you're out with friends or something). Don't let your diet run your life, but you'll find that the better you are at limiting the toxins you consume, the less often you get sick, get headaches or stomach aches, joint pains, etc, until eventually you NEVER get sick for any reason. You may even find that certain "un-fixable" issues you had in the past, such as allergies or asthma or dermatitis, also seem to fade away.</p>

        <p>Technically any compound in Nature can be considered a chemical... such as water... so no. I'm referring mainly to industrial chemicals and food chemicals and chemical fragrances. The shit many of us ingest daily without even realizing it. Your body only recognizes FOOD. Real food that is alive. Your body needs living cells to use as raw materials and the enzymes and bacteria along with them need to aid your microbiome in digestion and other important functions. (I'm speaking mainly about fruit, veggies, eggs, nuts, butter being raw. You should probably cook your meat unless you know what you're doing :) )</p>
<p>Everything that is not FOOD is an "antigen," meaning a toxin, as in it doesn't belong in your body and will build up until your body purges it. Sometimes when you get "sick" it's not because you caught a virus, but because your body has collected too much shit and needs to "get it all out." It does this in a variety of uncomfortable ways, including generating mucus, running a high fever, etc.</p>

        <p>you mean instead of deodorant? Pure baking soda works much better than deodorant in my experience. Rub a little dampened baking soda (not baking powder) under your arms and you will be odorless for days. If your skin is sensitive to that, just dissolve some baking soda in water and dab it on your armpits. You can also use salt water as well. Works fine.</p>

        <p>I take a good multivitamin. Always have. One from Puritan's Pride. I read a long time ago that good way to estimate if it's a quality one is if it has 100% on Vit K. Seems to hold true. The ones with 100% K always seem to have high counts in everything else too. Plus additional minerals and such.</p>
<p>A glass or two of cheap red wine a few nights a week. A soda now and then. Coffee when it's cool. Iced tea by the liter every day in the heat like now.</p>
<p>Usually only eat dinner. Meat, fish, pasta, salads. Common stuff. Nothing overly fatty every day but not super healthy every day either. Snacks during the day. Nuts, cookies, etc. Whatever I happen to pick up at the store. I don't stick with a particular set of stuff. Whatever's on sale really.   </p>
<p>Go for a walk. Spend time outside every day. Unlike modern homes in CA mine is older and actually has yards so I have trees to trim, grass to cut, things to water. </p>
<p>I'm I work (HA! these days) I'm on my feet all day but it's been months. Sub custodial/maintenance/warehouse for multiple school districts. I'm literally around shit and trash all day when I was working and I'm fine. I probably have the highest immune system around.</p>
<p>Everything in moderation.</p>

        <p>a good daily probiotic can do amazing things for your body, your gut flora is integral to maintaining a healthy immune system. also— not a supplement but good sleep hygiene (brushing your teeth before bed, washing your sheets every other day, washing your face before bed, etc) helps with overall health. i used to take zeal everyday but it is super expensive so i’ve given it up for now. vitamin D is obviously great, we’re all pretty much short on it.</p>

        <p>Not nutritional advice, just my humble opinion:</p>
<p>Brussels sprouts are a robust vegetable that stays fresh longer than broccoli and other vegetables. It's full of vitamins and nutrients and can be easily cooked or eaten raw. Kale and spinach are huge, can be blended into a nice green drink. Supplements I take: iodine (since the body cannot produce it on its own), turmeric, a general multi-vitamin, vitamin D, Vitamin K (fights plaque buildup in the cardiovascular system and is not commonly in multi-vitamin stacks), calcium, zinc...</p>
<p>I'd also recommend spending some time researching the fact that a lot of vitamins are in the families of other vitamins, but are referred to by another name. This in my estimation is a marketing tactic to get people to buy multi-vitamins and other stacks like B-stacks, etc..</p>
<p>FILTERED WATER! You save money, and reach better hydration status when your body doesn't have to filter the bullshit from even plastic bottled water. The filter does the filtering so your ORGANS don't have to. Since I switched to filtered water (basic-ass brita filtered water) I don't crave caffeine, I don't drink coffee, I don't crave energy drinks: I crave water, and it is good.</p>
<p>My coworkers think I'm weird for quitting coffee, and actively try to get me back on "cause it's so good". Sure, it tastes good and it does have a nice buzz, but I appreciate a tighter budget and control over my energy levels. My body is now that much more energy independent when I look at calories for my energy source, not caffeine. Cravings are aesthetics anyways (Good for the tastebuds!). I used to drink at least one energy drink a day for years, now I can't justify the daily expense because the value I get does not exceed the costs for me personally.</p>
