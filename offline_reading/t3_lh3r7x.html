    <strong>Why would they ever let things get back to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in the U.S., in a relatively free state. I refuse to wear a mask, which does shut some doors (for instance, I haven’t flown in a year), but principles are that important to me. I understand other people often have no choice but to wear a mask if they want to stay employed, and I sympathize with them. </p>
<p>In the last year, governments around the world have tested us and we have “passed” every single test. Whatever shit they’ve served up, society has swallowed and asked for seconds. I don’t need to list all the restrictions and infringements here, first because you’re familiar with them and second because I’d run out of room. </p>
<p>There’s no numerical endgame here. The Governor of New Jersey – home to the worst death rates this side of China – has said COVID-19 must be <em>eradicated</em>. Not controlled, eradicated. A single case is too many. Shit, a single case shut Western Australia down, or at least Perth. </p>
<p>Health authorities and heads of government have received next to no pushback. The restrictions just get more ridiculous, contradictory, and invasive. So why would governments ever stop? When the citizens have turned out to be more compliant than even Kim Il-Sung ever dreamed of – not just doing what they’re told, but mask-shaming and trying to cancel the few sane ones among us – why *wouldn’t* governments tighten the screws even more? Tens of millions of Americans own guns and yet our tyrants remain in office, spreading tyranny. And none of them seem too worried about being voted out of office. </p>
<p>We can’t all move to Sweden, Florida, or South Dakota. </p>
<p>I do my part. I don't wear a mask, I laugh at those who do, I patronize businesses that cater to barefaces. I live my life as best I can, even though some things I used to really enjoy are gone indefinitely. If everyone did the same, this bullshit would end tomorrow. WE OUTNUMBER THE RULING CLASS, handily. But that doesn't seem to matter. </p>
<p>I don’t mean to sound like a doomer but how do we get things back to normal without it taking decades or centuries?</p></p>

        <p>Don’t take my questions as criticism, I’m just thinking out loud. </p>
<p>Who is the war against? Is it the govt or maskers? Who do you shoot? The army will have a lot of decent people in it and they’re going to follow orders - should they die? </p>
<p>And when you win, what do you do to maskers? Do you arrest them? Or should you be the bigger man and let them live their masked lives?</p>
<p>Interesting ideas</p>

        <p>Yeah I can understand wanting to let off steam - and maybe memes help grow the community. But without real discussion and thinking out how things might go in reality, no one is going to take us seriously. Doesn’t fill me with hope</p>

        <p>They don't have real discussions because they aren't living in reality. They're LARPing in their minds about winning this "war" and just having the world magically revert back to 2019 status quo, or kneeling at their bedside praying for something to magically revert everything to 2019 status quo, whether it's God or a politician or whatever. </p>
<p>As much as people here like to claim to be enlightened, and that they're critical thinkers, they don't seem to put much thought into what sort of war we're fighting, what we can realistically do to help and win, who our real allies are, how the world is going to look like after a victory, and so on.</p>
<p>Again, our side has many problems. Disorganized, delusional, and also relentlessly stubborn (due to tribalism, so people prefer to point fingers and alientate anyone who doesn't fit in the "tribe" thus we lose potential allies and resources they can offer). They refuse to acknowledge any issues or road bumps our side might face, and just cling to their views. </p>
<p>Yeah, this will probably get me downvotes, and more hate here, but somebody needs to be the one to break the news to "their own". If we refuse to acknowledge our own problems and flaws in logic, we're really no better than the "enemy", are we?</p>

<p>From what little I know, any rebellion in modern history required the military or at least a significant chunk of it to be on the side of the rebels. But do any Western militaries even have a dogma anymore, other than "Do what the chief executive says"? I can't see any current U.S. generals speaking out openly in favor of freedom and against the Biden Administration, let alone taking up arms to reinforce the point.</p>
<p>State militias? I don't know. Might be the most likely option, and that only in a handful of states. If it comes to that. </p>
<p>But we, the people, in what's allegedly the Land of the Free (sorry, had to laugh there) still have the guns. It's strange how every time there's a mass shooting in the U.S., the victims are always innocent schoolkids or nightclub patrons or something. Never the bastards who actually grease the wheels. </p>
<p>How about civil disobedience a la Gandhi? I don't know if current civil authorities would slaughter innocent protesters like in the Amritsar Massacre, but given that in the last few months I've seen Mounties citing Canadian kids for playing hockey and Australian cops arresting people for posting stuff on Facebook, I certainly wouldn't rule it out.</p>

        <p>It's my opinion that who the war is against and between really doesn't matter. Race war, civil war, Taliban. We're caught in a cycle. There needs to be a bombastic event to break the cycle long enough. Imagine if only 2 weeks or a month went by with the news preoccupied with something other than their current propaganda regimen. I think the facade would begin to crumble.</p>
<p>And for the record, I won't be fighting the war. I don't even own a gun.</p>

<p>That's the kicker for me (in UK). I'm pretty certain we won't get to participate in another general election. Ever.</p>

        <p>I’m in Illinois and currently not in Chicago so I can basically do anything I did pre covid. I left Chicago to go by my folks. We have no rules other than a few big box chains require masks. Now I know they don’t work as much as anyone. I have a massive fucking beard. No part of a mask touches me other than bridge of nose. For me.. I’m not gonna hassle a worker so if I go to a chain I’d put it on.. but I choose to avoid them. I use Amazon and door dash for all purchases that I can. I can buy soda at my liquor store. So I’m unaffected. But.. you know the time is coming where someone will try to test my resolve. I’m prepared to take that in any escalation possible. This two mask shit isn’t about safety.. they want to test compliance levels. The curfews are the same when they were around. I went out when I wanted to. No cop said anything to me. It’s near that point where non compliance and cops will need to decide .. risk vs reward.</p>

        <p>"Barefaces" is such a chilling term. if that's becoming a thing I haven't heard it yet. Just usually anti-maskers or covidiots. But there is something very primal and simultaneously post-apocalyptic about the term "barefaces." A whole new hate term, a slur for the righteous to throw around, to categorize and stigmatize.</p>

        <p>Really? Because I coined it myself (although I'm sure someone must have used it before me) for the exact opposite reason. To me it has a similar connotation to "barefoot", like you're unencumbered: free of the societal restraints that encourage you to wear shoes. Like you're sipping margaritas on a boat in a Kenny Chesney video.</p>

        <p>It's tough because getting back to normal without action on the part of the government would require that the general population stop accepting restrictions, but the virus situation has shown that people overwhelmingly value safety over freedom. Widespread vaccination might be a turning point in peoples' minds, but then again, its very possible that it won't occur sufficiently and the media/government's fear mongering will keep people in line. </p>
<p>As individuals, there isn't that  much we can do other than refuse to tow the line and try to convince those around us to do the same. We can try to vote out politicians who support the new normal, but its not a reliable method. Organization would obviously be beneficial, but even though it should be easier than ever to organize, its extremely difficult these days. The idea of free speech doesn't seem to be valued anymore, and people who organize against the new normal outside of the internet stand to lose a lot; they and their families will likely be harassed, they will be slandered by the media and put on some sort of government list somewhere, and their careers will be in jeopardy. As a whole, I don't think people who are against the new normal are ready to risk so much to get rid of it at this time. Unless that happens and gains traction, there sadly doesn't seem like there's a whole lot we can do actively.</p>

        <p>So I’m a European and I compliantly disagree with this subreddit but I was curious so I checked it out I’m not here to hate or bully everyone has a right to their opinion.
But what I don’t understand is Wy so many people here think that the “new normal” is gonna stick It literally benefits no one big corporations are getting hurt too and an economic collapse is not going to be beneficial for the 1% Wy do you think this is some si-fi end of the world novel there have been pandemics before and there will be more yet things will always turn back to normal. </p>
<p>Also in my country we have a curfew now witch is ridiculous so I do agree some measurements don’t make any sense but still not wearing a mask out of “principle” is just stupid it’s not a big deal to wear a mask in stores</p>
