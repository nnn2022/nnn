        <p>Two Nobel prize winners, Luc Montagnier (medicine) and Michael Levitt (Chemistry) have both said the same thing. There are two forces at play to produce more dangerous vaccines here:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>The vaccines are leaky. As the CDC said Tuesday, breakout infections have high viral loads. While breakout infections are more "rare" compared to unvaxxed people, rare for delta is still relatively common. The number of breakout infections means that even if 100% of the population were vaxxed, the virus would still be about half as infectious as a seasonal flu. That's leaky. And it means the vaccines provide enormous selective pressure to mutate around immunity, and they are leaky enough that they can't kill the virus fast enough to stop it.</li>
<li>Antibody Dependent Enhancement. The mRNA vaccines don't produce a real Covid immune response. Instead, they produce an immune response to the artificial spike proteins your body built. Its an artificial scenario that doesn't resemble anything from nature. This presents a liability, since now every person who has had the vax who gets Covid produces this antibodies, which are different than the ones you would have naturally produced. This is going to present opportunities for the virus to mutate to take advantage of these antibodies. Producing weird, slightly abnormable antibodies is how a lot of auto-immune disorders work. In certain ways, these vaccines are inducing auto-immunity issues. The antibodies they make work for now, but does anyone know how susceptible they are to be infected themselves if the virus mutates even a little? When your body figures out to make antibodies, it does so based on a broad range of viral features. When you use the mRNA vaccine, you are only training yourself to recognize the spike protein.</li>

        <p>I understand how the mRNA “vaccine” is different from a regular vaccine but I don’t understand how the mRNA “vaccine” is different from normal infection from the virus. When a virus infects someone doesn’t it inject its genomic blueprint (RNA in the case of coronaviruses) and force the host to replicate the virus? The only difference between being infected with the virus and being injected with the mRNA “vaccine” is that with the virus, your cells would be producing the entire virus and with the “vaccine” your body would only be producing the spike protein. What am I missing?</p>

        <p>Lets open its ADE because if it’s escape unvaxxed are in trouble</p>

        <p>I believe that is why the test animals died.  They fought off the initial infection.  But were dead within a year because their immune system could not fight off other/new viruses.</p>
