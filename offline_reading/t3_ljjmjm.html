    <strong>It was like no one had stood up to her before.</strong>
    <p><p>I was in the hospital about a week ago to have my twin boys. When my husband and I got to the hospital we weren‚Äôt wearing masks. I live in a state with no mandate so no one really cared. In the room I had a nurse that came in and out of the room. She asked my husband and I to wear a mask in a not so pleasant tone. My husband pointed out that she was wearing an N95 and surgical mask over it, and asked why we had to wear one. She stood there for a minute before changing the subject. </p>
<p>It looked like it was the first time someone said no. The whole time we were there, a few more people asked but we said no. The doctor who eventually came in was a bit pushy but I think my husband scared him a bit. No security ever came in or anything. </p>
<p>That whole scenario really got me thinking. He didn‚Äôt even threaten the people, they just simply said no and no one knew what to do. I‚Äôve been a bit scared to stand up for myself because I‚Äôm smaller and I was pregnant, but now I see that a lot of people don‚Äôt even know what to do when told no. It gave me a bit of hope.</p></p>

        <p>I've been facing the same kind of thing on a daily basis. I'm in rural England though but I've pushed back against their nonsense at every turn. They really get their nose put out of joint when you say no don't they.</p>

        <p>Yes, I think a lot of them can fold in the face of a <em>no</em>, used to people just doing what they're told by their position of "authority*.</p>
<p>I don't tend to have too many problems, but I can carry a certain presence/readiness about me that means people do not confront/try to intimidate me.</p>
<p>I have female friends however who have gone to the same store, who have been reduced to tears on multiple occasions on one visit from ongoing harassment and abuse.</p>
<p>I'd surmise, people can be selective on who and how they enforce things.</p>
<p>Your husband sounds like a good man. Glad he stood his ground üëç</p>

        <p>Spot on with the selectiveness! A shop assistant  recently  verbally attacked me and humiliated me publicly (trying to incite other shoppers to join in her hate) for not wearing a mask... i then witnessed a young" good looking" guy get served by the same assistant and she never even mentioned the fact he was not wearing a mask! I'm a middle aged woman btw.it seems certain people relish having an excuse to bully people they don't "like the look of"...i am technically exempt from wearing one anyway,not that she bothered to find that out..its so sad how humans are policeing one another ect.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's cowardice, this selective virtue and choosing who to attack in my eyes.</p>
<p>And likewise, I find the self policing to be absolutely abhorrent. And history has shown it as a precursor to very bad things.</p>
<p>I'm sorry you've been accosted like that. But I'm glad you have a good man by your side. I fear it's going to get worse before it gets better.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

        <p>That is supposed to be the case in the United States as well because of the ADA. They are not supposed to ask you "Do you have an exemption?" because that is asking for private medical data that you are not required to give them in order to use their services.</p>

        <p>Exactly many people are just afraid to say the magic word "no" that violates their body and their rights because the pushers look too scary. Even if they don't leave you alone at first they usually just have a tantrum over not being able to control what you do with your body. If it wasn't masks with them it would be something else..</p>

        <p>And still she chose to help you. Even though, she naively believed that you could also hear her mother ask her, "You're still being safe at work, right? You know I worry about you.."

<p>Thumbs up! Way to show the employees who's boss!</p>
