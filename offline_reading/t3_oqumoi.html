    <strong>A Little Solace I‚Äôd Like To Offer...</strong>
    <p><p>Hiya everyone, I know this kinda post may be insignificant in the grand scheme of things and what with the current escalation occurring, but I‚Äôm feeling a natural compulsion to say this.</p>
<p>I expect many of you can relate, but the alarming rate with which authoritarianism is gaining more and more momentum and seizing the world by the balls is making my heart sink. I‚Äôm still young so chalk it up to na√Øvety on my part, but I‚Äôve approached every facet of my life on the principle that everyone has the capacity for goodwill and compassion. For the first time I find myself adapting to pessimistic tendencies as a means for preservation. I‚Äôm disappointed in my fellow neighbors of this planet and even more so in my faith.  </p>
<p>The consistent suffering, the moral negligence, the snooty passivity. My suspension of disbelief is hanging by a very thin thread. We‚Äôre sacrificing all that gives life meaning for Schrodinger‚Äôs goddamn security bubble. I‚Äôd much rather be left to my own devices to protect myself by trusting my instinct, instead of this creepy coddling we‚Äôre being coerced into accepting. Among other terribly nefarious measures, of course.</p>
<p>So many of us are at our wit‚Äôs end. Crawling through the trenches of deception while being outcast as morons is no way to live. Our existence is about embracing nature, not tolerating the manipulation of it. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs become especially daunting and heartbreaking that after 17 months those we know don‚Äôt share the same moral propensity as us. The real tragedies don‚Äôt trouble them and their shields of blissful ignorance are what‚Äôs maintaining the falsehood that nothing untoward is happening. Even friends I love I feel like yelling at them for their justifications and rationalizations that prevent the necessary confrontation of reality. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not an angry person but this left turn off a cliff in the timeline has become so unbearable and I feel as if my soul were dying. I‚Äôve felt helpless and useless, like I‚Äôm not able to aid those who need the time and attention the most. I‚Äôve been asking myself what my purpose is. I‚Äôve not survived all I have for it to end like this surely?</p>
<p>In the eyes of the majority, I at least would rather be a principled moron than a subservient shell who‚Äôs eager to please. </p>
<p>So my message is this: To anyone who‚Äôs struggling with their own awareness or plight induced by the shifting landscape, to anyone who‚Äôs plagued by that nagging notion of fear and despair, or even anyone who just wants a new friend, please don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch with me and vent. My DMs are welcome to all. Lord knows we could all use each other‚Äôs companionship to ride out the storm and none of us should have to go through this alone.</p>
<p>Personal unity is the most important of all. It‚Äôs how we build bridges that can one day lead to a future of harmony and tranquility, but not before.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt mean to harp on this just stems from a very emotional place in me and I wanted to cap it off by saying godspeed you beautiful bastards (term of endearment intended)‚ù§Ô∏è</p></p>
