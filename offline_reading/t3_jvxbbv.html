        <p>Well, to be fair, so does driving. But there’s no need to be making alarmist claims. Additionally, we are unsure of whether absurd regulations will continue even <em>after</em> the pandemic has ended.</p>

        <p>What use for the regulations would we have after the pandemic is over? They are going to end after coronavirus obviously because they are only there to make sure that people don’t spread coronavirus, and in japan people wear masks when they have a common cold, it doesn’t ‘infringe their rights’ or ‘stop them from breathing’, no they wear it to be nice to their country but now when it is serious they are ready to wear masks, and look at new Zealand: before Americans came in and ended their covid streak their regulations ended and they stopped coronavirus in their country by wearing masks and staying safe. What is the problem with that?</p>

        <p>Trust me, there's nothing more permanent than temporary government programs. Inocme tax? A "temporary" tax during war time. Welfare State (US)? A "temporary" measure to help America through the Depression. Daylight Savings time? Another wartime measure started in Germany, then copied by Britian and the rest of the world. All of these things were introduced during a "national crisis" and were to be temporary. All of them are still with us to this day and are regarded as normal.<br>
The problem with the covid rules are: they're likely permanent, they come with <em>massive</em> tradeoffs (mental health, ruined economy etc.), the advocates (middle class journos) and enforcers (police and politicians) suffer no real consequences and, worst of all, the covid rules are an assault on the fundamentals of human liberty.</p>

        <p>Look man, I wear a mask every day. This isn’t a matter of whether or not masks are effective in combating the virus. In this subreddit, we make it our goal to call out absurd regulations and actions in regards to covid, actions that make no rational sense. Like how government officials shut down businesses and places of worship, but they allow — and endorse — mass protests in the street. Like how the same government leaders that claim moral superiority because they wear a mask are the same people that are allowing the mass death of the elderly by forcing them to stay in COVID-infested nursing homes. It really comes down to a distrust of people in power, specifically self-proclaimed “righteous” democratic leaders.</p>

        <p>I agree mass protests are stupid. But if you even watch the news, you’ll know biden is currently making mask wearing a law among other things, he is here to help. I’m not a stupid political adult that shuts down everything everyone else says, I am in middle school, but purely from doing my research and watching the news, biden is here to help and all the stuff that is bad and was bad like mass protests was all trump being brain dead. Don’t worry, in January when biden arrives it will all be better</p>

        <p>Let me tell you something, kid. Biden is not here to help, despite all the nice words he says. Politicians don’t get where they are by wanting to help people. They get where they are by stepping on necks to get there. No politician, regardless of whether they’re a democrat or republican is going to save you. It’s up to you to keep yourself safe and be successful, not the government.</p>

        <p>You think Obama was really good because he received absolutely no pushback from the American media, and people took his nice words at face value. The opposite has been true for Trump, not that I think he’s the bee’s knees either. The truth is that Obama is a war criminal like all the rest of the presidents for the last 30 years, and Biden is bought and paid for by China. Things won’t get better, they’ll get worse. Things are going to get worse, and I shudder to think of all of the opportunities your generation has already lost out on because of this pandemic and the overreaching government response to it.</p>

        <p>I find it interesting that young people (middle schoolers, high schoolers, early 20’s) are the most prone to being emotionally manipulated and are, thus, more susceptible to the ideologies of the left. Please try to listen to other perspectives. Be wary of government officials and perspectives that endorse unnecessary dependence on the state. Be wary of political agendas that are being pushed by every celebrity and multi-million dollar tech corporation and billionaires. You will come to find that the Democratic Party is not for the People.</p>

        <p>He bombed 5!! new countries as president and the result was thousands dead and a modern day slave trade is the now-failed state that is Libya. He also drone-striked a 16 year old American kid in the process. I’d say that’s pretty bad.

        <p>Listen, I get you’re scared of that. I feel bad for you and your generation for being scared shitless about all of this and I don’t blame you. Even if your parents have pre-existing conditions, COVID is not a death sentence. Take a deep breath and get off this thread for adults because you’re out of your depth, don’t want to hear what we have to say, and it can’t be good for you to be steeped in this rhetoric all the time. I wish you luck in dealing with this, it must be hard.</p>

        <p>Lol, don’t feel bad for me. My generation isn’t dying of Coronavirus either. It is a shame that so many people are dying, but there is only so much this can be controlled.

        <p>As long as you are making even the smallest difference you are still making one. So wear a mask and social distance. And you say plagues have happened before, yeah that’s a bad thing and we don’t want so many people to die, to me y’all are pro death and pro plague because y’all like your luxuries more than safety</p>

        <p>Let me ask you, did you ever wear a mask pre covid?  If not you may have been responsible for one of the 60,000 deaths caused by the flu every year in the US.  Do you drive a car or ride in one?  There are 38,000 deaths per year.  There are also around 16,000 murders per year.  I don't know man, you should stay indoors and never leave.</p>

        <p>Wait wait wait wait ‘few’? Millions of people have died and still are. Wake up. And I don’t smoke, I never did and never will. Football is overly dangerous I’ll agree but that is not what we are talking about. None of these points matter what does matter is that when you put yourself at risk you put others at risk.

<p>That reasoning is flawed to the core. </p>
<p>You cannot, I repeat. You CANNOT remove risk from your life. One day, you'll die. We all will. </p>
<p>Stopping all human activity on the premise that it's risky is just not normal. </p>
<p>How do you think you'll get food on your plate if you stop doing anything? </p>

        <p>I am not in high school, so I can firsthand say for the middle schools that we stand against covid. I have a little sister in first grade and she wears a mask and does remote learning without causing a tantrum. She doesn’t mind because she knows covid is bad</p>

        <p>It’s okay to be upset. I see only 14,208 readers of this subreddit, so I doubt we are responsible for all that many infections. The truth is that some people fucked up, and we all have to live with that now. Containment is not happening in this country.</p>

        <p>The problem with wearing a mask and keeping a safe distance is that’s not where it stops..
We can’t send children to school
We can’t open our businesses
We can’t have people in our homes
We have to show test results to go places
We can’t celebrate holidays 
we can’t visit loved ones
And it just keeps going</p>

        <p>Imagine telling someone to stop whining who said that they are pissed off at you for telling a teenager to kill themselves due to political beliefs and because you don’t have any common sense. Sad</p>

        <p>at this point it just proves to me that you yourself have realized that you have no point here. Kind of sad that some people go through over 18 years of their life just to end up acting how they were when they were 9. But I won't respond anymore, since if I remember anything from bullies in second grade is that they do it when they realize they are wrong and have no point and want attention. In your case it is just you realized what an absolute dick you were acting like. So I bid you farewell in the hopes that one day, somehow, you will grow a third brain cell.</p>
