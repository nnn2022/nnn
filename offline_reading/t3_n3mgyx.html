    <strong>The soccer team I coach went from being one of the best teams in the league to being one of the worst all due to masks</strong>
    <p><p>I posted this awhile back in which I fretted about the strict mask wearing standards for the team of girls that I coached...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m6xlqt/how_do_you_convince_someone_to_lay_off_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">How to convince someone to lay off on enforcing strict mask wearing?</a></p>
<p>Long story short, I coach girls soccer and when I was head coach last season, I never enforced mask wearing among my team. The girls enjoyed the season and we dominated the league, averaging 3 goals per game, which is a lot for soccer. This season, I stepped down as head coach and my former assistant coach took the responsibility of being head coach. She enforced a strict mask policy on the team where the girls had to always wear masks at practice and games, with the only exception to get water. Mask wearing was not a rule for the soccer league, it was entirely created and enforced by her. </p>
<p>The result was... my team has become one of the worst in the league with heavy losses week after week. None of the girls in the other teams we played again wore masks and those girls outplayed our team by having a lot more stamina. The girls on our team tire a lot more easily due to wearing a mask while running. They simply cannot keep up with the energy of the opponent unmasked girls. This happens week after week and I cannot convince her to lay off on the mask wearing because she claims it’s a “moral principle”. In the few games I’ve spectated, the teamwork and passing have also gotten a lot worse. I wonder if this is due to players never seeing what their teammates look like. </p>
<p>But all of this for what? Our state officially got rid of the outdoors mask mandate a week ago. Even if we didn’t get rid of it, COVID transmission from young kids who are OUTDOORS is so incredibly minimal. I know this isn’t a big deal because it is just sports and there are far worse things that have happened due to mask wearing and lockdowns; I’m just a bit frustrated at the degree to which people religiously adhere to mask wearing and how it turned my team from one of the best to one of the worst.</p></p>

        <p>Their parents need to intervene (assuming they are minors).  Especially, since their is no external mandate forcing this. There was recently an article posted to this forum about a cross country runner who collapsed while running with a mask.</p>

        <p>The girls have to stand together and refuse!</p>
<p>Maybe you could help with that...</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, all should quit the team.</p>
<p>It is child abuse to let the girls wear masks during practice and games! I'm surprised none of them passed out due to lack of oxygen...</p>
<p>They should protect their own health!</p>

        <p>Well, your assistant coach is in a cult. It has been known it's hard to get people out of cults, once they've bought into them.</p>
