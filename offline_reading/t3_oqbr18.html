    <strong>I have a problem with school and home</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m 15 and I’ve been doing research on the vaccine like weighing the pros and cons for me getting it.
My parents are pressuring me to get the vaccine and saying stuff like you will have to wear a mask to events we go to.
Now to be fair they are actually really good parents and all just I don’t feel so when it comes to this subject. 
My school obviously pro mandating the vaccine and mask wearing, as they have just came out with a vote to require masks if not vaccinated. The main thing for me is I realize that masks only work in very little common scenarios and I just hate wearing them but I also don’t want to get the vaccine, I’ve been hoping that the staff will be lax on the whole mask thing but I don’t think that will ever happen. </p>
<p>Any advice</p></p>

        <p>So statistically you're in no danger from covid - so the pressure your feeling is just other people's politics and fears that they are burdening you with. </p>
<p>Be proactive - tell them you'll wear a mask when required and when the first lot of studies involving teenagers are concluded, ask them to sit with you and review the data. You can always take the mask off when you're around people who don't give a shit...</p>

        <p>You're about to realize just how stupid most adults are.  You can put the official statistics right in their face, and they still won't see it.  Trust the science means listen to the talking heads, not reading actual reports.</p>

        <p>Wow sorry to hear you're in that position.  If it comes to it I'll be telling my lad he need to hold out as long as possible, there's no going back from taking the vaccine. It's not right that society is discriminating against you. People need to see it's not right and wake up to what's going on.  It's going to take perseverance from those of us who are able to understand the gravity of the situation, brave enough to go against the general consensus, and strong enough to shoulder the burden that seems to be manifesting.</p>

        <p>A lot of people will tell you not to lie.</p>
<p>They're wrong.</p>
<p>When it comes to pass that you cannot reason with otherwise reasonable people (and at this point, you simply cannot reason with anyone that's drinking the kool-aid), you must do what you have to do.</p>
<p>You're not old enough to go out and make your own decisions. You haven't even gotten a chance to enjoy the autonomy that a lot of us remember having once. You're gonna have to do what you have to do.</p>
