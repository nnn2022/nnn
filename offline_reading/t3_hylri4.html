    <strong>Voting this year</strong>
    <p><p>So I lean left and I‚Äôm definitely anti trump but the way the left has been the past few months makes me question my choices this year.  I, like many in this sub don‚Äôt want this shit to keep going on but at the same time I also don‚Äôt want another four years of trump so I‚Äôm kind of stuck with the whole voting thing.  I‚Äôm not too crazy about Biden in the first place but sadly he‚Äôs the only other choice that we got and he even went on record saying he‚Äôd issue a mask mandate üôÑ</p>
<p>2020 sucks</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôm libertarian but I‚Äôm voting Trump. Jo gave into the BLM mob. This tells me when the pressure hits she will fold, and as libertarians we are supposed to put principles above all else.</p>
<p>Not only that Trumpnhas don‚Äôt a lot of things I like. With this lockdown stuff: no mask mandate nationally, called fauci out, pushed HCQ, tried to open schools and threatened teachers, etc.</p>

        <p>I am 100% pro choice.  But If there is no country left, there will be no more abortions to worry about.  1st part of building a house is the foundation.  Right now, we need the foundation to stop the lawless protests/riots and we need to stop the fear mongering left who are trying the Trojan horse ‚Äúthe new normal‚Äù through Covid.  Do you really support AOC?  That‚Äôs who the democrats are currently Following.  If that‚Äôs your thing, then I don‚Äôt know why you would oppose a new normal.</p>

        <p>Long time leftist here, made calls for the Bern up until late March (right up until he dropped out). The way I see it, is, unfortunately the Democrats have cozied up to the dystopian corporations pushing the new normal more than I ever thought possible. The environment weighs on me a lot, but no one seems to care especially with all of the single use plastic everywhere. </p>
<p>Voting for Biden is a vote for censorship, BLM (the Marxist organization, not the actual concept), and basically the death of America as we know it. So it's either Trump or Jo Jorgensen for me.</p>

        <p>Hello, fellow leftist.  I feel your pain.  The 2020 election is again a contest between two terrible candidates, neither of which I'm too enthused about.  Biden is a total non-starter for me (I voted for Bernie), and Trump has demonstrated that he is absolutely horrible. 
 Congress is not much better.  In my district, Maryland's 6th, we have David Trone running for reelection.  My problem is that he's a carpetbagger that's more interested in himself than his constituents, as he doesn't live in the 6th District, and prior to running in the 6th District, he ran in the 8th District, where he lost to Jamie Raskin.</p>
<p>All in all, I don't like the way that the Democrats have handled this pandemic at all.  The party of the social safety net has been the one sending people falling by shutting down everything, and has not stepped up with corresponding relief packages for the problems that they caused.  We would have been much better off letting the virus run its course while we went about our regular business than shutting down and turning the country on its head.  The government's actions in response to the virus have inflicted much more damage than the virus ever could.</p>
<p>To be honest, the whole thing has left me conflicted, because the Democrats are still, in general, the party that I most align with, but they are dead wrong in their handling of this situation.  The Republicans seem to be handling this better than the Democrats, but the Republicans are otherwise a disgusting party, politically speaking.  I feel like I can't get behind either one, really, because they're both fucking up my life - the Democrats with the unnecessary shutdowns and mask mandates, and the Republicans with their generally repulsive viewpoints.</p>

        <p>You still have to vote in local elections. I got called for a survey by my state senator‚Äôs office. I said anyone who stops this lockdown has my vote. (That, and pro choice). One thing we found out is out state, county and city politicians have a lot of power right now.</p>

        <p>Joe Biden is not the only other choice. That's just what the two political parties want you to think. There is a third option, and her name is Jo Jorgensen. </p>
<p>Don't get caught in the trap of thinking you have to vote for the lesser of the two evils. That is absolutely not true. If everyone that has ever said "I would vote third party, but..." actually voted third party, it would win in an absolute landslide. </p>
<p>Don't let other people shame you out of it either. If you want real political change in the US you will never get it by voting for anyone in the Democrat or Republican parties. IMO it doesn't really matter if you necessarily agree with her on everything. She's a libertarian, as such has very libertarian ideas. Regardless if you agree with her on everything, or anything, or not, if you want something to actually have a chance of changing, vote for her. </p>
<p>Bonus points for Jorgensen, she's never been accused of sexual assault.</p>

        <p>In 2015 and 2016 I considered myself a ‚Äúnever trump‚Äù conservative, I was very upset when he won the nomination, because I felt I had no real choice in the election, I despised Hillary and didn‚Äôt like Trump. I ended up voting for Trump because I thought he was the least bad option. Now 4 years later I have grown to like Trump. The more the media has constantly come up with the stupidest things to criticize him about, and the more I‚Äôve actually heard him speak, the more I like him. He‚Äôs still not perfect and says and tweets a bunch of cringe, but he is way better to fight the new normal crap then what would happen with Biden and the left. You have to vote or not vote the way you feel, but I feel strongly a Trump re-election is the best chance at ending this crap the fastest.</p>

        <p>Please consider the very real possibility that Biden's running mate, who hasn't even been named yet, could be the next president- not Biden.  Biden has yet to make public results from a cognitive test and he's clearly showing signs of Alzheimer's.  Be careful who you vote for- Biden could be declared unfit pretty quickly by a VP who wants to be president.</p>

        <p>Voting in general - and the concept of government - kinda sucks.</p>
<p>You're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Though there's another option - just don't vote, and focus on what <em>you</em> can change. Life your best life, focus on your friends/family/yourself, and ignore politics. For the most part it's all just theatre; your vote doesn't actually change much, and the person in power doesn't actually change much.</p>
<p>But you can make a hell of an impact on your own life - and the lives of those closest to you - if you want to. If you choose to.</p>

        <p>Jo Jorgensen and the Libertarians are the obvious choice for the United States. Neither Biden nor Trump are consistently opposed to lockdowns or the "new normal" of mask mandates, so voting for one of them would be pointless if the objective is ending lockdowns and the "new normal". The candidate for President that stands for that that has the most support is Jorgensen.</p>
<p>Also consider, even if Jorgensen has no chance to win, what would send a stronger message to the powers that be that you want your freedoms back: voting for Trump or Biden, or voting for Jorgensen?</p>

        <p>I can't vote for Biden anymore, I just can't.  That really really sucks since I really don't want to vote for Trump either.  We really need a viable third party candidate more than ever.</p>

        <p>I wish we could draft a third candidate that spoke out against this madness, like RFK jr. or Ron Paul.</p>
<p>Watching the way Dershowitz groveled before RFK jr. during their recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfnJi7yLKgE">debate</a> made me think that the bad guys actually want to be stopped at some level, they're testing to see if we'll pull it together and stop them.</p>
