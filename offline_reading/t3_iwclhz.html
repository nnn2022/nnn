<p>I am genuinely afraid it'll never come back. This is as good as it will get. Because I really do believe that this shit is never-ending. The hysteria keeps on coming.</p>

        <p>I'm just so tired of masks. For me this is the most demoralizing and dystopian part of this whole mess. It's stripping us all of our humanity and everyone seems not even just ok with it but enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p>I'm in the south so we're pretty much reopened, I'm back at my office, I'm back at my gym and seeing friends and going out to do normal things. My fiance and I are even traveling via air next month.</p>
<p>So outside of missing large live events and postponing our fall wedding, my life is pretty normal. EXCEPT there's fucking masks EVERYWHERE. Granted, I've stopped wearing mine in most places (much to the chagrin of my sweet SO who follows all the rules to a T) but anywhere indoors here there's a mandate that you're supposed to wear one. </p>
<p>I just don't want to live like this anymore. This complete lack of control over my own life is the scariest feeling. The pandemic (or at least the media hardon for this mildly unique coronavirus) will obviously end eventually but I see no end in sight for masks and that's terrifying. I don't want to live in a world where masks are normal. It's unnatural.</p>

        <p>I hate when people post photos of themselves on social media wearing a mask in a situation in which I know they did not actually wear a mask. For example, a Facebook friend who lives near me posted a photo of herself wearing a mask in a friend's backyard. She smokes pot and drinks with that friend. I'm sure she doesn't wear a mask there. I'm in the San Francisco Bay area, where wearing a mask means you're a smart and good person.</p>

        <p>A few months ago, my mother-in-law asked if I had a bandana she could wear until she got some "real" masks. I gave her one in an attempt to keep the peace. First thing she did was take a mask selfie, send it to her siblings, and post it on Facebook. I took away the bandana when she wasn't looking.</p>

        <p>i also decided to bake some ciabatta, which is a stupid easy bread to bake that i can't possibly fuck up ü•ñü•ñü•ñ</p>
<p>(no, i never got into the early lockdown baking obsession. in fact, i love to cook and bake but i really haven't been doing so the last six months. i mean sure, i did braciole and full Thanksgiving dinner and lots of breakfast casseroles until about May because i love my husband and i love to feed the people i love, and then i gave the fuck up on trying, lol. i used to make a detailed meal plan for each week, prepare a list for the grocery store, and spend an hour shopping, then i would do our meal prep on Sundays. quite disciplined really, and then i lost my will to live! gotta get back to the business of living, Pippi.)</p>

        <p>okay so the ciabatta was a success! (trust me, i'm as surprised as you are, lol üò≤) </p>
<p>i'm bringing a loaf in to my office tomorrow morning with some local apple butter and honey üçØüçéüåª (Virginia does fall and farmers markets right, my friends)</p>
<p>this recipe makes four small loaves, so i'm not a saint or anything, and i don't think my husband should eat all this bread and neither should i, lol üòÇ but damn if this nutella and bread isn't hitting the spot!</p>
<p>sleep tight, amigos and amigas, and wake up tomorrow and get that metaphorical bread - be the light you want to see in the world, and don't let them take your sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è and if you have to, make your own damn sparkle ‚ú®</p>

        <p>SO and I went to the gun range to shoot our new purchases bought during lockdown. No one was enforcing masks!  It was great!  Some people had them on but the employees weren‚Äôt wearing them and no one asked me to put mine on when I walked in not wearing it. Even SO, who is less of a boat rocker than I am, took his off once he realized no one cared. It was nice to feel a little normal for a bit.</p>

        <p>My new friend is normal!!</p>
<p>We're texting and he said he got upset about workers not wearing safety gear when he went to a bank. I rolled my eyes and thought "here we go", but he explained he meant construction workers. There's a construction site near to the bank he went to. He meant to say the construction workers working without safety gear got on his nerves.</p>
<p>An actual dangerous job that does require safety equipment. He also differentiated between a specific task that would require, for example, a harness, and a task that wouldn't. To use words of his:</p>
<p>"They don't need a harness to measure where a cable will go, but they need one when they're three stories in the air!"</p>
<p>The irony is he considers himself weird because he's autistic and doesn't always understand emotions or hints. But he's the most normal person I know right now! YES!!</p>

        <p>I just noticed that more people are still drinking the Kool-Aid and wearing masks outside.  Also, the first refugees from California are arriving in my area (Central Florida). I pray that they share the same state of mind and don't vote for politicians who would support masks and lockdowns for the next pandemic or even the flu season.</p>

        <p>Every day I go for a walk outside on a beach path in my town. About 80% of people wear masks, even when they are walking alone or riding a bike alone. If I am about to pass someone on the path, people will adjust their mask to make sure it is correctly on or if it was around their chin, they will pull it up over their nose. I want to give people the benefit of the doubt that they are doing this to be polite to ‚Äúprotect me‚Äù from their germs (though I could care less). However, I really believe that a lot of these people are scared and when they see someone without a mask on about to pass them, they adjust the mask to protect themselves. Everything is just dumb right now.</p>

        <p>I am feeling very encouraged and wanted to share my experience. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and as soon as I got to Walmart I noticed both the doors were open and people were freely walking in and out, they got rid of the line outside the doors. When I walked in there was no bouncer there counting the number of people coming in or enforcing masks. They still had a divider up blocking the entrance/exit sides as soon as I walked in I saw someone ignore it and come out the entrance side. They had the mask required sign up but shoved to the side. When I was in the store a saw over half a dozen people without masks(and this is a state that has a mask mandate as well). All of the one way aisle stickers and arrows on the floor had finally been removed. I saw some older ladies stopped in an aisle laughing and talking with each other like the old days. They had the disinfecting wipes fully stocked for the first time since February and people weren‚Äôt panic buying them. I witnessed an employee upset and crying about something being comforted and hugged by another employee without concern of ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù. It felt like the first step back to returning to the old normal. This was in southwest Wisconsin for reference.</p>

        <p>Incredibly frustrated by being forced to comply with surveillance testing at my university. I‚Äôm a graduate student on TAship so this is my source of income (otherwise I would‚Äôve taken the semester off). But all registered students living in the area are forced to be tested every week. My university has some of the most draconian restrictions on students and unfortunately we also have low case counts so they think their measures are successful and plan to keep enforcing them. But really it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre in a small town and most of the students are from NYC where the pandemic is essentially over. Why should I bother to continue complying if, despite extremely low cases, they continue to treat us like prisoners? I don‚Äôt know what to do or who to complain to. I tried skipping my surveillance test yesterday to see what would happen and I got a call that I had 24 hours to take one and ‚Äúdo my part‚Äù (<em>barf</em>). Thinking of just skipping again and seeing if they come after me, but I‚Äôm scared of losing my job and career (I worked my ass off to get into this PhD program). </p>
<p>Sorry for the long post. I feel trapped and so disappointed in the university that was once my dream school and I just want to scream.</p>

<p>vote rationally, vote reasonably, vote your conscience.</p>

        <p>I pay so many damned taxes üòÇ</p>
<p>I think if I find a place I enjoy more than the hellhole that is Portland, OR, I will think long and hard about how I vote. I know west coast people flood other more moderate/sane places and unthinkingly keep voting the same way they always have, without thought to whether that‚Äôs preserving the very ecosystem they were attracted to in the first place. They keep on voting in the same kind of politicians that decimated the places they fled  from. </p>
<p>I just pledge not to do that. When I vote it will be when I feel like I understand the place and the politics, and it will be meaningful to me as a transplant to cast my ballot.</p>
<p>I sometimes think not voting is overly demonized. Or that, perhaps more accurately: voting at all is prioritized above being informed and reflective. I think it‚Äôs more moral to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure on this one and I don‚Äôt have the time to research it,‚Äù than to say ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt know who I voted for really, but I did vote.‚Äù </p>
<p>MTVs ‚Äúrock the vote‚Äù (I‚Äôm showing my age, here) comes to mind. It wasn‚Äôt called ‚ÄúMTVs actually get politically informed‚Äù </p>
<p>Haha.</p>

        <p>lol rock the vote hahahaha i still remember MTV when the veejays were shilling voter registration!</p>
<p>you're exactly the person who should be voting - thoughtful, deliberate, considerate. i'm not trying to fluff you!</p>
<p>i am always disappointed in U.S. voter turnout because it shows how many people among us just don't care, and it sucks. only ~58% of us voted in 2016, it's disgraceful! i don't know how to make people care about voting, but we gotta figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>source: https://guides.libraries.psu.edu/post-election-2016/voter-turnout</p>
<p>i'm so old that i remember taking the U.S. Citizenship test in 8th grade, and not only did i pass with 100%, but i was the only person in my "honors" class to pass, and the first person in the history of my junior high to pass the first time. fucking. embarrassing. </p>
<p>why can't we teach civics and government, FFS? jfc!</p>
<p>i wish we didn't have to vote on every item on every ballot. (for example, i'd love to skip voting for prez this year and vote for local and state issues only, but them's the breaks. i'm an adult, and adults make choices.)</p>
<p>also, i'm the asshole who doesn't vote the party line - always an R and a D and I vote on my ballot. whoever has the least bad idea wins in my book. not all conservative ideas are bad and not all liberal ideas are good. </p>
<p>then again, we seem like the sort of people who do our research and think about the problem at hand, and think about the future, and conduct a thorough risk assessment. we're probably too sensible to vote in most elections.</p>

        <p>Got my first handshake since all this started! :) Got told off for it later by someone else, "that's illegal!" Two people spending half a second touching each other's hands with consent is now illegal, and they can't see how ridiculous that is?! I don't even see how "that's illegal" is an argument - especially when the people who say that are regularly breaking the law with actions like speeding. "It's the law" doesn't make sense coming from somebody who selectively chooses which laws to follow. If you drive above the speed limit, you're saying you know better than the government and are making your own assessment of the correct speed to go based on your personal opinion of safety and convenience. So don't scold me for not following laws that I think are ridiculous. Hypocrites.</p>

        <p>Anybody been shopping at Walmart (yeah I know, terrible place but sometimes when you're in the sticks you can't be too choosy) and fantasized about ripping up those ridiculous floor decals every chain seemed to whip up within a couple weeks of this nonsense event?</p>
<p>...I kind of wish I worked for a decal printer now. We'd be rolling in cash.</p>
<p>But anyway, it's always so dumb seeing them. Not even just the "THIS IS WHAT SIX FEET APART LOOKS LIKE YOU IGNORANT CLODS" ones but the directional arrows that tell you to treat the grocery aisles as one way lanes. Fuck that, I walk opposite them just out of spite. I heard an old lady mumbling angrily into her mask about people (me) not following the arrows  as I went by her. I just smiled and gave myself a silent 'mission accomplished'. And pondered what would happen if someone "accidentally" put the arrows on wrong so that they both faced outward. Would the Masked Morons just give up on ever getting any peanut butter from the shelf trapped behind the don't-shop-this-way mark? Realistically, no. But it was amusing to picture.</p>
<p>The very fact this sub and similar ones exist is enough to give me back a little faith in mankind. Keep up the fight, guys.</p>

        <p>Having a hard time "coming out" to some people. I've been chatting over messenger with an old family friend and told her I'm on vacation in Croatia. She's a genuinely nice person and expressed concern about rising cases in Europe, particularly in more open places like the Balkans, and while she didn't outright tell me I shouldn't be here, I know she's probably thinking it. I could send her a barrage of links debunking the casedemic, but I really don't want to get into combative territory with this person who's been nothing but kind to me. At the same time, I don't want her to think ill of me for enjoying this trip. I know I can't have it both ways here but it's just tough.</p>

        <p>I've just been reading through some of y'alls discussions for a little while and wanted to ask a question just to clarify something. What's the negative to wearing a mask?
Like I get the while slippery slope logical fallacy but what does the gov get from having you wear a mask.
Like at least in my thinking it'll make it harder for them to keep tabs on you, especially because it interferes with facial recognition(which hypothetically would be the best way to begin to actually control your life 1984 style)</p>
<p>Please share your thoughts with me, I'm eager to learn.</p>

        <p>it is a scapegoat. why are you talking about 1984 like we are paranoid schizophrenics? i want my politicians held accountable for this colossal fuckup. we spend $7 billion a year on the CDC and their cunning plan was to ask people to self-isolate in dense residential areas while reminding us all to wash our hands after we take a shit.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the response,
I'm not sure what the CDC could have done differently. I agree that the politicians got in the way but the CDC wanted more aggressive measures then politicians were willing to enact (at least in many areas). But what does holding them accountable have to do with wearing masks or following guidelines?
Also do you not think that self isolation helps slow the spread of diseases?</p>
