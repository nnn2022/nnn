    <strong>Stop Making up Excuses Before It's Too Late</strong>
    <p><p>Anybody who's wearing a mask in America is stupid and/or a coward. I have NEVER worn the muzzle and I've had zero issues. One time a kid called me an asshole, but that was it. </p>
<p>People who say it's mandatory everywhere are cowards and making up excuses. They're just scared of someone giving them a stare. </p>
<p>There is no real mandate in America, YET. Because of some of you cowards, though, it'll become the law at some point and punishable by prison or something.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since I'm getting lots of downvotes both on the post and the comments where I try to educate you on how not to get harassed while not wearing a muzzle, it makes me think:</p>
<p>Is this sub only about posting memes and bitching about the "new normal" or do we actually want to prevent a "new normal" from happening?</p></p>

        <p>I gotta give it to you OP. I try not be confrontational but you're 100 percent right. </p>
<p>If you're wearing a mask and getting on this sub bitching, you're doing nothing, except showing that there is one more person on a very small subreddit that gets it. </p>
<p>It's time for disobedience. It's time for disobedience now! When you see someone else without a mask, tell them to keep it up and don't back down. </p>
<p>HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE! There is no reason to be rude, confrontational, or anything combative. JUST STOP DOING IT! </p>
<p>When someone asks you to put on a mask, you say nothing at all, do not break stride, do not engage, just move along as if the person isn't there. You empower them when you engage. SAY NOTHING! It only makes it worse. </p>
<p>YOU ARE NOT ALONE! YOU WILL EMPOWER OTHER PEOPLE TO GROW A SACK!</p>
<p>I promise you, YOU SEE HUNDREDS of people a day that wish they could be like you, and by you disobeying you will empower them to do the same. </p>
<p>JUST STOP COMPLYING!</p>

        <p>Thank you for your kind words. </p>
<p>As you mentioned confidence and being polite are key. Very rarely have employees asked me to wear a mask. I respond politely but very confidently that I can't wear a mask, and move on. No one ever bothers me after that. </p>
<p>Non-employees have never said anything to me, except a kid one time called me an asshole. I posted about the interaction on this sub a few days ago. </p>
<p>Non-employee activists, being the scared cockroaches that they are usually pick on women. That's why you see a lot of smart and brave women in videos getting made fun of and called "Karen." God, I hate it when they use that name for anyone from either side of the isle. </p>
<p>The mistake these smart and brave women make is they try to first reason with the idiots and then get frustrated and loud, and that costs them the battle. </p>
<p>They should ignore other customers completely and if confronted by employees, they should do as I do. Be confident, be polite, say you can't wear a mask, and start walking. IN THAT ORDER.</p>

<p>Exactly, and I've been saying that for months. I feel bad for the women who choose to make a stand, because you're correct they get picked on. No one fucks with me because I'm a man and I take care of myself and while I wish I didn't, I kind of have that "Don't fuck with me" look most of the time. 
It pisses me off so badly when I see a woman getting screamed at by a mob of people, and I know for a fact if it was me there the video wouldn't even need to be taken. </p>
<p>Just a lesson of, don't feed the trolls. Don't look at it, don't reason with it, just dominate it! </p>
<p>It really pisses them off when you just pretend they aren't there. But it pisses them off in a way that they tuck and run and probably find their first available dopamine hit by getting on the internet and complaining about it.</p>

        <p>I get your drift, we need to walk in politely, just like Axel Foley in Beverly Hills cop, and if they throw us out a gotdamn window so be it. Things like that is what gets others stirred up to passion and action, like with Rosa parks on the bus.</p>
<p>We just attempt to go mask-free as if it‚Äôs 2019, But no fighting or arguing, remain calm and polite and smiling and only leave if they lay hands on us.</p>

        <p>So what do I do if a cop or security guard tells me to wear one?  What if the random asshole confronting me about my mask doesn't let it go after I walk away?  What if I have such a bad temper that I'm not sure I can just walk away when someone confronts me?  Why should I try to reverse the "new normal" in a city like Chicago, which is already a lost cause?  Are these not legitimate concerns or something?</p>

        <p>The fear of all those things is what stops you from trying. </p>
<p>I grew up in Chicago, so I get it. Of course I had sense to move out of that hellhole asap, but that's neither here nor there. I lived there when it wasn't the murder capital of the US. </p>
<p>I was in Chicago 2 weeks ago, I have a customer there and my Mother still lives there. I went into a hardware store on Milwaukee, a market close to Logan Square, and several places in the suburbs back and forth with no mask. Nowhere, not once. The dude at Binnys in Downers Grove came up to me and stood in front of me and told me to put my mask on, and I smiled at him and walked around him and made my purchases. When I walked out he glared at me as if he wanted to kill me, but that's just the way it is. They still took my money. </p>
<p>I hear what you are saying, I really do, but the questions you are asking are the very reason the shaming, guilt, and fear works. You have to rise above that fear, because at the end of the day, that's all it is. Those are some big what ifs, and they just don't happen in reality, you just gotta prove it to yourself.</p>

        <p>Trust me, I get it.  When I was in rural Wisconsin, I never wore a mask. 
 And when I'm in the southwest suburbs, I rarely wear one unless I see a cop around.  But in Chicago, the only place where I can get groceries within walking distance of my apartment is a Target that has private security guards and sometimes actual cops posted at the entrance.  And there is a big sign near the entrance saying that you are required to wear a mask on the premises.  For me, it's just too risky to be the only guy at that Target not wearing his mask.  If that makes a coward, then so be it.</p>

        <p>I've been saying it for months, I realized very quickly after Covid started that NOTHING will change the apathy in America, their consent was manufactured, and where the rubber meets the road they will fold like a chair. There is only one person in my personal life that I know that possibly has the balls to revolt, and he's even sus. I mean revolt in a real way. I mean saying bye to your children type shit. </p>

        <p>Dude, fuck off.  I already told you that Chicago police officers sometimes stand at the entrance of the Target where I buy groceries.  And as far as they're concerned, the mask mandate is the law.  You're basically asking me to risk my entire future in order to engage in a futile act of civil disobedience.  It's nonsensical.</p>

        <p>I refused to wear a mask for months despite living in a small town and being the only one NOT wearing one since it was mandated in June. It was a pain in the butt but I chose to do it.</p>
<p>But now my town has gone full doomer and no longer accept ANY reason for not wearing a mask. So I'm refused entry, despite any and all efforts to do so without a mask.</p>
<p>What do you do then? Somehow I expect most people judging others on this matter live in an area that is currently lax on mask enforcement (like my town was at first) and when they're outright REFUSED entry, no matter the reason. They'll change their tune. If you're courageous to let yourself and your family starve to prove a point to the morons surrounding you, good on you.</p>
<p>I know exactly what comes after the masks. I know exactly the long term agenda at play here. I tried doing the right thing but things are getting much worst in my area. If the sheep want to wear their muzzles let them. I'm done.</p>

        <p>It is very fair to say it is geographical. I live in a midwestern state. We tend not to be irrational lefty acting virtue signaling morons around here. Although I go to the Chicagoland area frequently for work and they are Covid zombies over there and I still don't wear one. </p>
<p>If I was you and you feel that it's impossible to stand your ground, walk in with a space helmet on, buy a darth vader mask, hell when I feel froggy I'll throw a paper bag on my head from time to time for a laugh. Find a way to resist. It will garner you the courage to dig in when the time comes.</p>

        <p>I did this for a while, got a guy fawkes mask. It was hilarious the first few weeks. But then it became old and you can't see shit in one of those, plus I wear glasses. And they would get all fogged up.</p>
<p>Now I just put the muzzle and keep it under my nose so the glasses don't fog up.</p>
<p>Turns out I agree with OP completely. Just really disliked his condescending tone. Just sounds like he hasn't truly be forced to wear one just to survive yet. When it gets to that point he will and honestly, there's nothing shameful about it. </p>
<p>We fought the mask battle for as long as we could. Tried to show the people around us you could resist. But at this point, I've been insulted enough times that I frankly don't care anymore. I already know the vaccine is the next step and getting ready for that battle instead.</p>

        <p>Lol, I already shop without a mask. I've successfully cited protocols that allow me to shop maskless if an employee presses me to wear a mask.</p>
<p>That particular instance was a membership venue, I could technically take them to court due to me being able follow distancing protocol set by the governor but not worth the time or money. My job also went out of business for the moment so I won't have to go there anymore.</p>

        <p>I live in Canada (Alberta) and there are certain stores that won't let you in without a mask, but there are many that don't comment and some that ask me to put on a mask and I simply say I'm exempt and move on. They mumble under their breath and roll their eyes, but if it's not store policy to enforce the mask wearing, I've been fine going on my way.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right. We need more men like you.</p>
<p>I'm a small pregnant woman and if confronted at stores I say "I can't" and keep walking. </p>
<p>There are places where this doesn't work though... I can't find a single hospital, birth center, or even independent midwife who will take me as a customer without lockdown compliance yet. I'm still looking, but I'm not sure what I can even do if none of them will give me service without the muzzle.</p>

        <p>Ideally you could file a lawsuit for discrimination but most people haven't got the funds for that, especially now, worse case scenario is to claim exemption on mental health grounds, High anxiety for example</p>

        <p>I agree, it's revealing to see the excuses people have made to keep the mask on. I can understand it though, it's scary to single yourself out. </p>
<p>The way I see it though, the vast majority of people who wear masks are scared and obedient people. They are not the type to call anyone out. They may resent those that don't wear the mask but they are too scared to speak up about it. That's how we ended up in this mess to begin with.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the encouragement!</p>

        <p>Every single time Ive tried to enter a store without a mask, I immediately get asked to put a mask on. I get it, civil disobedience and everything. But I am actually going to the store because I need to buy groceries, not to argue with employees and the manager and get escorted out by security while being filmed and plastered over the internet in a public shaming orgy. </p>
<p>More power to you if you have never worn the mask, not sure where you live that it‚Äôs possible. I honestly think we need a much more sophisticated strategy than flouting mask mandates to get anywhere near fixing this mess. Protests, for instance, are much more effective. As are businesses refusing to shut down. I really don‚Äôt think you are going to get far by calling people who agree with you cowards and shaming them for wearing a mask. I 100% agree that it is absolute utter garbage that people are being forced to wear masks, however, it absolutely pales in comparison to the actual cost of these lockdowns. Since I‚Äôve joined this community I‚Äôve felt that focusing on the masks is a huge mistake, plays right into the propaganda of our overlords by making us look like we are losing our shit over ‚Äújust a piece of cloth‚Äù. </p>

        <p>There is a mandate in Chicago.  Outside the Target where I buy groceries, there is a big sign that says you are required to wear a mask in order to enter the premises.  There are security guards posted at the entrance.  Sometimes, there are actual cops there.  I'm not about to risk my freedom or even my life just to engage in some atomistic form of civil disobedience that will mean nothing in the grand scheme of things.</p>

        <p>Whether or not the mandates constitute an actual "law" is neither here nor there.  The governor of Illinois, the mayor of Chicago, the security guards at Target, the Chicago police, random assholes, they all act like it's a law. And Chicago is dangerous enough as it is without drawing extra attention to myself, so I'm not about to risk my freedom or my life just to make a statement that will mean absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things.  I have no interest in saving Chicago anyway.  Fuck this place.  I'm gone the second I get my degree.  So you do you.  I respect that.  But at least try to understand that not every situation is the same.</p>

        <p>I know what you're saying.  I'm saying it's not worth the risk to me.  In Chicago, things can go sideways in a split second.  All it takes is one random asshole or some cop having a bad day.  I don't know if you've ever lived in a city like this, but you don't draw attention to yourself unnecessarily or invite random interactions with strangers.  It's actually dangerous.  People get shot and stabbed and beaten and robbed here on a daily basis.  And the cops are no better.  They will jam you up without hesitation.</p>

        <p>I refuse no matter what as well. I only worry about going to doctors, and the ER if something should happen to me. I still won't wear a face diaper to save my life, but what could I do at that point? If I need immediate care, how would I get them to take me? They just mostly seem to stand there smugly like "No mask? Not our problem then, go away." One woman had a broken finger, but they still refused to take her. Yet what gets me, is if they took the time to argue with her, couldn't they have just as well taken her? Same thing happened to me in the spring. I was going in for a shot, and in the time it took to argue with the nurse, she could have given it to me already, and she was standing right next to me. Anyway, does anyone know what I could do? I am going to make an eye exam appointment soon, I finally found a place that would take me, 4 hours away. But what if I have an emergency and need to get to a hospital? Does anyone have any ideas? I feel like they'd just let me die. But one thing's for sure, I'm not putting on a face diaper for anything.</p>

<p>&rt;Is this sub only about posting memes and bitching about the "new normal" or do we actually want to prevent a "new normal" from happening?</p>
<p>Well, you're basically saying I'm a coward because I wear a mask when I shop for groceries.  But as I tried to explain to you, the "new normal" is already a firm reality in Chicago.  This place is a lost cause and nothing I do will make one bit of difference, which is why I plan to leave Chicago the second I finish my degree.  What you see as "cowardice" is just me being practical and thinking about the long term.</p>

        <p>OP‚Äôs position is objectively superior to yours (or mine). </p>
<p>By engaging in small acts of defiance, OP gains courage - each time he rejects the mask mandate, his defiance is rewarded with a sense of victory, of success. Such experiences accumulate and foster in OP the general belief that defiance is not only possible, but <em>likely</em> to be successful - and therefore a worthwhile endeavor. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, your behavior is reinforcing and normalizing compliance, while gradually cementing your perception that defiance isn‚Äôt worthwhile, or even possible. </p>
<p>In other words, OP‚Äôs behavior is gradually setting him up to take a real stand if and when necessary. Your behavior is setting you up to cave completely and permanently. </p>
<p>OP‚Äôs behavior is objectively better than yours is - the fact that you feel inferior (and therefore compelled to drag OP down to your level with comments dismissing his defiance) doesn‚Äôt change that. </p>
<p>And as for your feeling ashamed of being scared and complacent ... that‚Äôs a true waste of life and emotion. If you‚Äôre going to simply accept these mandates, then fully accept them, with no shame. You get to make the call about what is best for your life, both immediately and long term - and there is no shame, ever, in choosing what you honestly consider to be best for you. </p>
<p>The only reason to be ashamed is if you truly believe that <em>defiance</em> is the best option for you, and you don‚Äôt choose it solely because compliance is easier or more convenient in the moment.</p>

        <p>Good for you but wait t'ill the "rules" change in your area.</p>
<p>I hadn't worn a mask since this hysteria started but now the government updated the "rules" and none of the shops will accept my medical exemption anymore. So now I'm forced to wear a dirty piece of cloth on my mouth to buy groceries or I starve.</p>
