    <strong>Some thing that I realized</strong>
    <p><p>If this virus was as horrible as it was portrayed used masks would be considered extreme biohazards. What's the correct way to dispose a biohazard? A red biohazard bin. You would see more of those red biohazard bins but instead people throw out their used masks like they're candy wrappers.</p></p>

        <p>I was at the mall today and we went to the food court. I asked my wife if she thought anyone else thought about how it makes no sense that people walking through the food court had to wear masks but everyone (hundreds of people) sitting down were not wearing masks. As I was looking around everyone just looked so casual about the whole thing as if it made perfect sense.</p>
<p>We also had to wait outside a shoe store because they wouldn't allow more than 5 families in at a time</p>

        <p>Yup. You would NOT be able to keep your mask in your car, or pocket, any more than someone would keep needles tainted with blood. Also, it wouldn't be the case of "oh use whatever you want, bandana is fine!", you'd have to use a specific level of mask. And if the threat was so large, even these retarded governments would be giving away those special masks for free to the population, since the threat justifies the expense.</p>

        <p>I actually saw an article that more people should use cloth masks to cut down on pollution. Like are you kidding? If this virus is really a threat they should be encouraging people to use the highest quality mask possible and treating it like you would any other biohazard when it comes to disposal. It just doesn’t add up</p>

        <p>Bodies in the streets, collapse of services, mass general strikes, businesses closing voluntarily, pepole fleeing urban areas. Yeah, the rich folk are moving out, but if this was a real public health emergency, there would be rivers of human foot traffic streaming from major metros. There would be real, serious restriction of movement, flights, trains, busses, would all be shut down. If this were a real crisis, you'd see the signs all around. You'd know. All we have here is a full court propaganda press. You don't need propaganda to spread the truth. You need propaganda to sell a less than truthful narrative.

<p>If you count refrigerated morgue trailers we already have that. And if not, why would you expect people dying of an illness to be lying in the street? Wouldn't it make sense that once someone's very ill with a contagious disease that they would be at home or in the hospital, not walking down the street?</p>
<p>&rt;collapse of services</p>
<p>Some places are currently facing a collapse of healthcare services</p>
<p>&rt;there would be rivers of human foot traffic streaming from major metros.</p>
<p>Because joining a mass exodus and moving into a refugee camp is a smart way to avoid a virus?</p>
<p>&rt;movement, flights, trains, busses, would all be shut down.</p>
<p>So you'd rather them have COMPLETELY shut down the country?</p>
<p>&rt;You need a huge coordinated propaganda effort to sell a big lie.</p>
<p>A lie like that a virus that every government in the world has acknowledged and taken action to combat is actually a democratic hoax to hurt Trump? And also that it would dissappear after the election?</p>
<p>&rt;If this were a real crisis, you'd see the signs all around. </p>

        <p>We don't to C O M P L E T E L Y shut down the country for a virus with an IFR of .2%.</p>
<p>Even a virus with an IFR of 5% would not warrant that. Especially when the bulk of the populace dead are above 75 years of age, in nursing homes for things like dementia, and were coming to the end of life in the first place.</p>
<p>The problem is cases like those of my 69 year old parents. Mom had this disease forced on her by a negligent rehab center sending Father home with this disease because they didn't bother to do a CoVid-19 test on him even though they had actual symptomatic cases in their rehab center/nursing home.</p>
<p>I'm royally livid with that rehab center... but of course I'm not going to get ANY justice because Maryland is thinking of absolving rehab centers and nursing homes of ALLLLLLLLLL responsibility even in cases of medical negligence in this Casedemic.</p>
<p>Probably be dead in a few years since I cannot work due to mental illnesses.</p>

        <p>That's a good point.  I was also saying just this morning that wearing a mask can make a sick person sicker, as the virus/bacteria/infection, instead of leaving the body when you breath out, will accumulate on the inside of the mask, causing the person to continually re-breath in infection particles and when touching the mask to adjust it, will spread more virus onto the hands and everything the person touches.</p>

        <p>How about this one. Dining at an it's edible and quick family restaurant chain, a group were seated at a table and one of the party dropped the mask on the floor, didn't see it. another patron told him and though it was disposable so they probably,maybe had more somewhere, picked it up off the floor and put it on the table and then later on their face.</p>

<p>You know in a twisted way people should be glad they are lying about the convid/convirus because what I and I'm sure may others have seen and know of people's habits and practices  let's face it most people would be dead. And why no gloves?  People, not just kindergartners, touch everything. Oh that's right just wash your hands and pinky swear you did.</p>
<p>Yeah you know that Stephen King The Stand? Though a fictional epidemic yet somehow was more realistic? You read/watch it and like a lot of things, people say, no one can be that stupid that would never happen........yeah........</p>

        <p>My coworkers keep used masks on their desks and all on their keyboards. Masks are filthy and so are keyboards. I guess the irony of that is lost on them. At least they throw them away properly.</p>
