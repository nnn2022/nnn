    <strong>I don’t think the NPC‘s telling you to wear a mask believe their own bullshit.</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe it’s just me, but I have noticed that everyone in my life that is preaching to people to wear a mask and stay home are the same people that posted pics of them at Halloween parties on Snapchat.</p>
<p>First example, one of my coworkers was complaining to our boss about the store being over capacity and she didn’t want to risk getting covid, but then she took a weekend off to go fly across the country to see her boyfriend. I am the only non-doomer at this company. They are always trying to alter store policy to save us all from Covid, and yet my boss had to pay three of them sick pay for when they got Covid someplace else. If they’re exposed to Covid at a party, fair enough. But if they’re exposed to Covid at their job? God forbid.</p>
<p>I have this other friend who is really uptight about masks, if we go to a restaurant he takes the mask off to eat, but when the waiter comes back to the table to check on us he puts his mask back on. But he has no problem hanging out with me maskless and he has no problem going to parties maskless. This is also just one guy, I probably have 30 friends just like him.</p>
<p>Saving the best for last, there’s this one guy went to high school with who at the start of the pandemic snap chatted me and I assume everyone in his contacts every single day reminding you to wear a mask. It got so annoying, and then eventually I caught him at the gym not wearing a mask. The next day, when I got my Snapchat reminding me to wear a mask, I told him what I saw the previous day and asked him who the hell he thought he was preaching to. I have not since gotten a reminder to wear a mask.</p>
<p>I don’t think they believe their own bullshit, I just think they want to chance to talk down to you. Which sounds pretty in character for the way people seem to behave these days. No one will EVER pass up a chance to talk down to people. That being said I don’t think they’re actually doing this consciously, I’m not sure how they rationalize it in their head, but I don’t think they’re just looking for an excuse to talk down to you, I think they actually believe they are always doing the righteous thing at all times and are justified in talking down to you, even if they’re applying their own rules inconsistently. Sort of a 1984 doublethink scenario, where they are always believing they are doing the right thing, regardless of whether or not it’s consistent with what they’re telling you is the right thing if that makes any sense. They don’t believe their own bullshit but they do believe that whatever they are doing is the right thing which sometimes coincides with their bullshit whenever it’s convenient.</p>
<p>Do you guys notice your doomer friends not following their own rules? I’m very curious to see if I’m the only one.</p></p>

        <p>I think this is very common. My family have moaned about others breaking the rules, while breaking the rules themselves. 
I see many of those who complain about people not using masks, are often the ones that are quick to pull their mask below their chin for quickness, throw it in their bag or pocket and just inviting germs to it which defeats the point. </p>
<p>I think you're right in it just being a way for most to talk down to people. Because they think they're doing right, they couldn't possibly be the ones in the wrong. I think thats how it goes</p>

        <p>Was at a party in December. One of the participants drove us home later, complaining the whole time that it was people at parties causing the problems. People are just that dense, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>It makes no sense. </p>
<p>Some people I work with are apparently very afraid and stay very careful, but then everyone goes their separate ways and does whatever on the weekends, comes back on Monday morning and use the same phones, keyboards, pens, copy machine or whatever. I’ve yet to see anyone disinfect any of this stuff other than our weekly cleaning crew that comes in.</p>

        <p>It's a religious practice. People tend to be ignorant about science and statistics and unusually obedient to government authority, so they don't have any knowledge to analyze these strictures rationally. They only know "mask on = good," and they don't realize the real-world limits of using masks so they don't see the (stupidly obvious) contradictions in how they use masks.</p>

        <p>It's like any Placebo. The person who uses it thinks it is real, and it doesn't matter if they use it correctly or not - It's the belief that is important.</p>
<p>Try to explain to them it is only a placebo and not real - they flip their shit.</p>
