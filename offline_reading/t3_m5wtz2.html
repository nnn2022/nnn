    <strong>Had a baby shower last week</strong>
    <p><p>Had my baby shower last Sunday. 27 people attended with no distancing or masks or any of that bullshit and we all mentioned how stupid the whole COVID thing means we were all horrible granny killers. (My granny was there. She didn't spontaneously combust in the gathering which I thought according to doomers would happen.)</p>
<p>One of my friends in the group chat mentioned how we should all get tested to see what happens. So we did. All of us booked the same day and got our results back at roughly the same time. 27 people with no distancing, masks, all sharing utensils, hugging, and enjoying life met last week, and this week all 27 tested negative for COVID19.</p></p>

        <p>Got married in September. 100 guests. We were supposed to wear masks but nobody did. Hotel staff just shut the doors and minded their business. Nobody got sick. Even went to Disney World for the honeymoon. I’m NOT letting this stupid shit ruin my life.</p>

        <p>I hope you continue this approach when the baby arrives. I had my daughter last April and I’m so glad that I’ve ignored lockdown rules and visited my family and my husband’s family regularly. She’s almost one now and she’s so sociable and happy. We went to the supermarket yesterday and I realised how much visiting family has probably benefitted her when she spotted another baby of a similar age and started smiling and waving frantically. The baby just stared at her like she was an alien and it was just so sad. It’s so unnatural for everyone, but children especially.</p>

        <p>I own a nursery and we've been going through the wringer with babies born before lockdown who are terrified of other children and won't settle because of lack of socialisation. With the parents going back to work it is horrible for the kids since they spend each day screaming in blind terror over it.</p>

        <p>Oh god that’s awful. I’m so glad my daughter has seen her cousins so she’s had some interaction with children. She also seems really confident and sociable anyway but I can imagine some children are going to really suffer like you said.</p>

        <p>The worst we have is one wee boy who was born during lockdown. Today was his first time seeing other children. Mum didn't even take him to shops beforehand. He literally clung to mum then went ballistic at the door when she left. He was crying so hard he threw up and gave himself a nosebleed.
 His mum said she had no idea why he was so upset.</p>
