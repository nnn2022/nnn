    <strong>After this ends how will we identify each other?</strong>
    <p><p>Right now we share hate on the current phony covid narrative and it is pretty easy to identify one another.</p>
<p>After all this went down, I realize how different we are from the NPC's. </p>
<p>How will we identify each other after the storm? I won't feel good going back to mainstream subs ever again and would like to form relationships who people who aren't crazy in the future.</p></p>

        <p>This is really a great post, but I don't know the answer. I have lost friends over this who deemed my views on the lockdown and progressive movements as IGNORANT or bigoted. I almost have trouble believing that we got along so well for all that time.  </p>
<p>Granted, this is not to say I pushed my views on them, tried to convince anyone, or was even insulting. They just cut me off. I suppose we are just an inherent danger to certain types of people.</p>

        <p>Damn, your post hits home. Ditto. That, and indirectly being called crazy on more than one occasion by “friends”. I can’t even have a civil discussion about it nor do they seem to want to be friends with anyone with differing opinions anyway. Yikes.</p>

        <p>I mean I tend to think you'll be able to tell based on political leaning / philosophy. Politics is something that usually comes up once you're past date one or two  and I think that's something you can suss out. not necessarily in terms of left versus right but what their opinion of of how things are being run is. I think a lot of the anti-lockdown folks reaffirmed or formed their skepticism in the government from this and will probably hold that skepticism for a while.</p>
<p>And I think for at least the three to five years after all this while it's still pretty fresh I think it's going to be a pretty easy topic to ease into particularly for the people who didn't go nutso.</p>
<p>Don't know how old you are but 9/11 was an event that stuck around strongly in the cultural mind for at least five years and it's still a thought in people's mind today,  by the very fact that you immediately know what I'm referring to when I say 9/11.</p>
<p>I think that will be enough to help you figure that out if it's important enough to you. It's definitely worth holding over people's heads right now but the longer we hopefully get detached from this crisis the more I don't think it's fair to judge them for their beliefs at this time. People change and people learn from their mistakes.</p>

        <p>I didn't have too much skepticism of the government. I supported lots of 'left' policies. I actually was never really into politics. I minded my own business, worked on my own stuff, and anything bad in life was my fault. I never really "trusted" them but at the same time I never thought they would go full on insane.</p>
<p>Now I don't trust ANYTHING they say. All faith has been lost. 100%.</p>
<p>I never noticed or cared about 9/11.. but being Canadian maybe that makes it different for me. I am under 40.</p>

        <p>That sounds like me except I did think some 9/11 conspiracies were possible. I just didn't think it was likely. Then this happened and I lost all trust whatsoever in the government and MSM. I had this great trip to Canada planned this past May. My kid was super excited. It cost a ton. The border is still fucking closed. Not like I'd go on vacation during crazy, masked 🤡world anyway.</p>

        <p>This is a good question. I'm astonished with the reaction of the people in my life who I thought were skeptics. The veil has been lifted, and I can't unsee the ugliness. Social engineering is powerful.</p>
<p>This shit has permeated almost all aspects of culture. It's not so cut and dried anymore. I can't think of a free-thinker signifier we can use, and even if there was one, it would be eventually hijacked by NPCs to look cool. We already know 10 years from now that virtually everyone's going to say they were against the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Going forward, we should use the power of vetting and asking the right questions. But now is a good time to make friends with like minded people. I made a friend on this subreddit and we help each other out.</p>
