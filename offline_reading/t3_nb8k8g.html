    <strong>17-25 year olds are some of the most brainwashed, backwards people right now</strong>
    <p><p>As a 21 year old, I hate people my age. I took a walk with my girlfriend today, OUTSIDE, through our college campus, and 15+ people were wearing a mask outside walking alone. One kid was wearing a mask while riding his bike. Bunch of fucking idiots </p>
<p>This is supposed to be college, where people are able to think critically about a situation, and apply knowledge. How brainwashed do you have to be to wear a mask outside with not a person in sight for hundreds of feet? </p>
<p>This age group are the least affected by covid, have arguably given up the most in terms of lock downs and college and BEING SOCIAL, yet almost everyone i’ve talked to in that group, is a huge advocate for mask wearing and lockdowns. Unbelievable lmao</p></p>

        <p>My friend got vaccinated a few months ago. Today I was talking to her about her hair thinning. I told her to check out Nioxin (shampoo to help with thinning her). Her response? "it's not FDA approved."</p>
<p>My head exploded.</p>
<p>I'm early 30s, she's mid 20s.</p>

        <p>Yes it basically works by causing all your follicles to be in the anagen phase (active growth) for longer. But that also means that when they get to the exogen (shedding) phase they all fall out around the same time which can make it seem like your problem got worse, until they all grow back in.</p>

        <p>You know... I hadn't considered it until I told my mom the story and she asked when my friend got vaccinated. It's actually wild because she's having a multitude of health issues right now. But she additionally got the iud within weeks of the vaccine, and I know she's been having sharp pains and bleeding. It could be a combination of all things.. But I didn't consider her thinning hair as a result of the vaccine until today. And unfortunately, she is not one I can suggest this to. I stay in my lane with all talks Vax, unless I'M being engaged with like-minded folks. But I will continue to ask her about her progress or what not. I'll definitely recommend this to her 👍🏻</p>

        <p>Kinda unrelated but I had problems with hair thinning when I used to wash it every day. After I stopped doing that it’s thicker and fluffier than ever. </p>
<p>Now I only wash it every 3 or 4 days. I was afraid to stop because when i first did, it would get really greasy, but that went away after a week or two. I think it was from my body overcompensating to replenish the oils I was stripping out of it.</p>
<p>I still shower of course and am a very clean person in general, but I don’t think people need to wash their hair every day unless they’re doing something that would get it dirty. Just a thought, I don’t think it’s a coincidence</p>

        <p>Agreed 100%. For me, I have too much of a mental block about needing to wash it every day to feel clean, even though I do know that's irrational to think. So, what I've been doing lately sort of as a compromise is using a baby shampoo for every wash. Johnson's new formula is very mild with no bad stuff. It's much less harsh compared to regular shampoo. So I'm still able to satisfy my need for that clean feeling every shower without stripping too many oils. Might be something for the original poster to consider, if they also have this mental block about feeling clean.</p>

        <p>Cosmetologist here. Unfortunately baby shampoo that is tear free is incredibly harsh on your hair, despite how gentle it seems. The reason it's tear free is because it's formulated to be the same PH balance as the eyes (and your other mucous membranes) so it doesn't burn if it gets in a baby's eyes. The PH balance of your hair and scalp is much lower than your eyes and that can cause a lot of issues (dry scalp, dandruff, breakage etc). It's also very stripping of the hairs natural oils despite that baby soft feel. My professional recommendation is a cleansing conditioner or just using a conditioner appropriate for your type on the days you don't want to wash.</p>

        <p>Tell me how exactly is a selfie forcing you to do something? Just close instagram. </p>
<p>Again, it's a free country. You do you. Private businesses are allowed to do what they want. Private citizens are allowed to take selfies. They're not forcing anything on you. </p>
<p>If one of them accosts you, then yes, you have a point. But selfies are free speech buddy. Read the fucking constitution.</p>

        <p>That’s not the point, although actually that has never happened to me personally even though I have friends who are very enthusiastic firearm owners.</p>
<p>I want a gun anyway, and me owning one wouldn’t hurt anyone because I would be very responsible with it and only ever use it for anything besides target practice if my life or the life of someone I care about was in imminent danger. If I get this vaccine however I have no idea what will happen to my body.</p>
<p>No one is saying people who don’t own guns should be shunned from society, but that’s what the powers that shouldn’t be are trying to do with vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>"Force" isn't the right word - it's well understood that posting a picture doesn't <em>force</em> anyone to get a vaccine. It's also well understood that they have a right to post whatever picture they want. That doesn't meant it's above criticism though. </p>
<p>I think the point being made here is that selfies of getting a vaccine is contributing to a social pressure that presses on people to get a vaccine themselves. But it would be irresponsible to allow social pressure to contribute to one's medical decisions because social pressure doesn't determine the outcome of said medical decision.</p>
<p>I'd wager the poster isn't intentionally trying to pressure others into getting a vaccine, but intent is irrelevant.</p>

        <p>&rt;intent is irrelevant</p>
<p>by that argument, folks who unintentionally culturally appropriate clothing are 'pressuring others', and should be criticized, regardless of their intent.</p>
<p>I'm sorry but if the social pressure from some 26 year old millennial is getting to you, then you have already some serious doubts about your own values and beliefs.</p>
<p>Look you can criticize whoever you want. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of asking for the freedom to speak against the vaccine but also criticizing those who choose to speak for it.</p>

        <p>I think they are socially pressured into their belief system. Most are not willing to risk becoming the outcast of their tribe. And the rest where taught to believe that wearing your mask is the simplest thing you can do to save your tribe from death. Anyone not trying to save the tribe is now the outcast.</p>

        <p>No I just told someone else that they shouldn’t run away to the woods either we have to fight for our rights where we are. Their are laws against forcing children to do something that is detrimental to them. You just have to learn that and also learn how to stand up for yourself. </p>
<p>I couldn’t live with myself making my kids wear masks in school. You owe it to yourself. It’s OK to cause a scene, it should be encouraged. This is madness.</p>
<p>And yes, if you are in a job that contributes to this fascism then you should quit. I quit as soon as they threatened me for not making people wear masks.</p>

        <p>I can sympathize with parents who are dependent upon public schools for the daycare aspect. 
There are many options in between government funded public schools and backwoods homeschooling. 
Attend the school board meetings, email the chairpersons, demand masks mandates be lifted. Enroll in private or Christian schools. 
Not everyone can, or dare I say should, homeschool; but every parent of school age children has the responsibility to be actively engaged in their children’s education.</p>

        <p>I never made my daughter wear a mask anywhere, and if they tried to make her I turned around and walked out.  Thankfully I live in Florida where 99.9% of the time nobody cares, even the schools have dropped this mask nonsense.  Its nice seeing everyone run home from school looking normal and happy.</p>

        <p>One of my coworkers pulls up everyday with his mask on, alone in his car. He has his own office, so he has his door shut the entire day. I’ve seen him wearing his mask alone in there at his desk a few times. Been working here 11 months and I couldn’t even tell you what half the guy’s face looks like. </p>
<p>All I know is he’s a fucking dumbass</p>

        <p>Yes the irony of talking about personal mask choices and yet being triggered by someone choosing to wear one.</p>
<p>Look IDGAF about you not wearing a mask in a private space. I think businesses have the right to ask you to wear one, but it's none of my personal business.</p>
<p>Just like it's none of your personal business if someone wears a mask in their car or at home. Maybe they like it. What happened to mind your own business?</p>

        <p>Yeah but a personal choice that is a result of government propaganda with the purpose to influence that choice. </p>
<p>Moreover just because it's a personal choice doesn't mean I can't criticize it. If you wear your clothes inside out I am allowed to think you're an idiot. I'm not allowed to forced you to wear them properly but I can have whatever opinion I want to have about it.</p>

        <p>Damn that’s a stretch. I don’t remember running with donkey kong. Have we raced some time in the past? Someone who’s obese would run much harder than I ever would because I am in good health and don’t struggle to run, so you probably are right about that. Mr so fast so hard runner man.</p>

        <p>It's not just the masks. That's just a part of it.</p>
<p>Most are fed up with the contradictory measures and rules that go counter to any science based recommendations.</p>
<p>Also the back and forth approach politicians and the health ministers are taking defies any logic or reasoned approach.</p>
<p>I see many rightfully calling this out. If the measures and recommendations made more sense and actually followed the science they claim to based it on, more people wouldn't have a problem with it.</p>
<p>When science is ignored and the "just do it because I said so" approach is taken, that's when many will find an issue with it. And to be clear, that's where the freedom argument is mainly coming from.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be oversimplified to saying that people think masks remove their freedoms. Governments not following the recommendations of a large number of experts and scientists to enforce totalitarian measures like lockdowns and contradictory mask wearing rules is an attack on our freedom.</p>

        <p>College used to be where critical thinkers went.  Now it is a four year indoctrination/vacation while billions are are transferred from taxpayers to the education industry.  Most college students shouldn't be there and will end up working in a field that requires additional vocational training, OJT, or doesnt require their degree at all.</p>
<p>This is before you realize that most colleges manage to transfer no education, and the majority of students show no improvement in their critical thinking, reasoning, communication skills, or command of basic facts after 4 years.</p>

        <p>Ugh!  I agree with this so much!  I am pushing 40 myself, depending on the chart you read I am considered a millennial but I identify as a xennial (that awesome 5-6 years in the late 70s to early 80s).  </p>
<p>Anyhow - I am currently finishing up my associates degree (done after summer 2021 semester) and will begin my bachelors in fall 2021.  My bachelors will be in management of human resources, my associates is in business administration.  Aside from maybe 3-4 classes in my associates NONE of them will help me not pertain to office life and/or human resources.  How will I use biology in being an office admin or in human resources?  </p>
<p>As someone who already has experience in the field, I can tell you 100% that the associates degree is just a money grab by the college system.  It has nothing to do with anything relevant to your ultimate goal.  It's almost like combining all 4 years of high school into two.  Don't get me started on our high school curriculums.</p>

        <p>The answer is that “Management of Human Resources” shouldn’t even be a program you go to university for.  The idea that university is where you go to get training for a specific job is something that should go away.  University should be where you go to become <em>educated</em>.  The idea of a liberal arts education, where you study literature, history, math, sciences, etc is what university should be for, and if you want to learn how to be a nurse, x-ray recognition, HR professional, or even an engineer, you would go somewhere specifically to study that.</p>

        <p>The best thing would be that the universities are responsible for any money loaned to a student who wants to study there.  If the student can’t get a job that will pay for the degree, too bad, the university should have done a better job educating them.</p>

        <p>Yes. Even in high school they do not prepare these kids to enter the work force on any level. My son is currently a junior, 11th grade, in high school and he gets absolutely nothing from school. It's just a requirement. As far as what will actually help him in life and he can use, he learns more here from his father and I than from this institutionalized education system. It's all about standardized testing.</p>

        <p>I agree with this so much!  It would negate the need for all these irrelevant classes leading up to acquiring your associates degree.</p>
<p>Even if I just stopped with my associates in business administration, there is no need for biology to be an office administrator. It's wasteful of money and time.</p>

        <p>Meh for me personally I made the decision to get the vaccine. Mainly because of my immune disorder as in having a glutton allergy. Meaning I'm more affected by the common cold than most people etc...</p>
<p>That being said I understand why some don't want to take the vaccine and I respect all of your decisions. It's isn't anti vaxx to not trust a new type of vaccine.</p>

        <p>Take this for what its worth:</p>
<p>Young people and women in general are very concerned with fitting in and being popular. Many care more for validation from their peers than from more profound accomplishments. These people do not care about facts or science, they just want unconditional approval from their friends. They do not care if they are right or wrong; they only care that you are making them question their behaviour through your example.</p>
<p>Beware of these people because they are the banality of evil and they are legion.</p>

        <p>I’m in a similar boat right now. I live in Missouri, where masking and other restrictions are almost nonexistent outside of Kansas City or St. Louis. Yet in and around my college campus (not located in KC or STL), everyone blindly follows these rules. They’re the least at risk group, yet they “protect” themselves the most. I once believed college was filled with kids trying to at least look like rebels, but it’s pretty clear that’s become false.</p>

        <p>One issue that is really affecting modern life is the fact that internally, most people are the heroes of their life story, and need to be heroic.  People need deeply to feel that they are doing good and making a difference.  In college we used to value education and students would be proud of their grades and their hard work as students, and their future employment.  Now the average grade is A- as long as you show up, and everyone in the liberal arts is going to become a barista or waiter because they lack skills for anything else, they need to find some other personal narrative.  Usually one that isnt too hard, because if they were the types who liked hard work they would have done something else in life.  Some students go for being a race-savior, others a climate-savior.  Seems like lots of people have decided virtue signalling their rigorous compliance with nonesense hygiene protocols "to save grandma" is a demonstration of their inner heroics.  It is a great story, they wear a mask and that marks them as the elite, the people who truly know how dangerous covid is, as opposed to the rubes and white supremacists who ignore the rules.</p>

        <p>This is very well said. I think it partially goes back to participation trophies and “everyone is a winner” mentality that began taking hold sometime in the late 90s/early 2000s. I remember it when I was a kid and I’m sure it’s only gotten more extreme. The fact of the matter is, simply participating in normal (or even somewhat unique) activities does not build character or make you a hero. Heroism and success require focused effort and discipline.</p>

        <p>I'm 20 years old and live in a very blue state and county. I assure all of these COVID vaccine mandates are politically motivated, to which I don't wish to participate in. My university seems like they're going to keep it mandated, and I'm afraid of the possibility that Amazon (the job I work in) might do the same. I will either take the jab or become jobless without a degree.</p>
<p>I swear after everything I've seen online for the past few years, people are just fucking insane. I don't know what the hell I'm going to do if my school and job mandate it. I will probably have to abandon my family and move to Florida or some shit just to save myself.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be anything about conspiracies, it's just I simply don't trust a vaccine that has ZERO long-term studies when actually testing on humans. Fine, it's been studied for decades, but it's only recently it's been tried on humans.</p>
<p>What the fuck happened? Why the fuck is it controversial to say "I don't trust the government and media"?</p>

        <p>The majority of people following orders and mandates are those watching the news. The rest of em are all folks with anecdotal stories that are NOT the norm. It's all political and we've become self - policing... virtue signaling one another into violating our own bodies and intuitions. You're not wrong to have an exodus plan. If you're not and haven't planned on taking the jab, don't do it, friend. The likelihood that this'll be actually mandated nationwide is very high, but I still wouldn't ever take the jab myself. Best of luck to you.</p>

        <p>If vaccine is mandated at my job, I will refuse and get fired.  I thought about quitting on off chance it's mandated but realized I'd rather get fired to not give them satisfaction. </p>
<p>If vaccine is mandated by government, I'll sell the house and move family. That simple. No ifs or buts.</p>

        <p>universities have been taken over by marxists 20 years ago.</p>
<p>no one comes out of them smart.</p>
<p>in fact unless you are studying for a licensed profession, universities are useless. you'll learn faster and cheaper from a combination of youtube, small subreddits and torrented books.</p>
<p>going to university is almost always the low IQ choice, only exception is when your desired profession requires a license.</p>

        <p>Sorry, pal. But today, at least in the US, "college" and "daycare" are almost synonymous with each other. There are free thinkers, critical thinkers, but it's more the exception rather than the rule now.</p>
<p>That said, it also takes more courage to think for yourself now, so maybe there are more people who think critically but are too afraid to stand out. It's just a reality. We're weaker than ever, physical and mentally. Just do you. Don't let them drag you down. Waste as little mental capacity on them, and you'll be better off.</p>

        <p>Always have been always will be. Who supported the nazis the most. Well the young due to the hitler youth. Modern society doesnt have such a program obviously. But many schools and teachers still "brainwash" children. I have personally seen it as i am 20 years old and alot my friends who were apolitical at one point became leftists after some teachers started telling a bunch of lies about the how the world works. One teacher straight up said that all women would make less money than the boys unless they revolutionised society.  Another defended the actions of stalin and mao.</p>

        <p>I graduated from a west coast college a few years ago and this is scary accurate. Our teachers spewed bullshit liberal ideologies while at the same time preaching to us that capitalism doesn’t work. There was even a “communist” club in school and I shit you not the president used to walk around campus dressed in a Soviet outfit. Luckily the club had barely a handful of people in it but the fact that they were allowed to operate on school grounds is mind boggling.</p>

<p>How far can the population be manipulated and coerced into compliance through the use of fear, division and peer pressure.</p>
<p>I hear you when you say that people your age going to college should be thinking critically and asking questions to challenge any narrative. This is healthy and makes for a free and progressive society.</p>
<p>What's happening now is the complete opposite whether you believe in the official narrative or not. And that needs to be challenged with thought, reason and tough questions.</p>

        <p>I know. It's tough to witness but we won't get far by insulting each other and calling people names.</p>

<p>There has to be a certain amount of respect and patience. Keeping our egos in check is critical.</p>

        <p>They use insults and name calling when it's groups of people they hate and want to blame them for this, aka fat people, old people, minorities, LGBT+ groups, etc etc. Yet I get called out when I point this one, whether politely or not. Those posts that say shit like "Look, people ages 17-25 are to blame!!!" are upvoted and in the front page (this is literally one of the front page posts for NNN). I'm sick of the people on our side, to be honest. If I didn't care so much about freedom and not wanting to live in a fucking dystopia, I'd have stopped coming here long ago.</p>

        <p>I'm not trying to convince anyone, honestly, because I know they won't change their minds no matter what I or anyone else "against" them says. I know they're stubborn, bigoted, hateful, ignorant, and so on. I'm just venting, I suppose.</p>

        <p>LOL. Fair point. Venting is good for the soul.</p>
<p>Call me an optimist, I still think there are many reasonable people out there who have their doubts and might be confused but find it hard to resist the barrage of brainwashing they're being bombarded with daily.</p>
<p>If it's not the media or politicians, it's their family, friends and neighbors just blindly repeating things they heard on the tv.</p>

        <p>I say that as a 31 year old with no kids who’s mom was 31 when I was born (and I’m the oldest). My parents did a great job but I can definitely see the merits of being a younger parent.  My dad will probably be close to 70 by the time I have kids, and based on seeing my grandfathers age through their 80s, I have serious doubts that my dad will get to see my kids grow up.  I don’t regret the path I’m on but there definitely are some downsides more serious than “I’m young without much money and don’t know what I’m doing.”</p>

        <p>They're intentionally unprepared. It would take very little effort to teach basic childrearing in schools and even less to learn it at home (if the nuclear family weren't being undermined or completely destroyed).</p>
<p>When has any of the "earth science" or "language arts" they're teaching in schools been useful? Sure, you can diagram a sentence and tell us the different types of rocks but how does that advance the blue collar working class? The people who <em>actually</em> built this and every country? It doesn't, its intention is to force you into college and into debt. Mocking the the jobs that would allow you to start your life on your terms and coercing you into delaying your family until it's even less possible to care for them correctly.</p>

        <p>My campus was requiring everyone had their masks on unless they were in designated mask free areas.</p>
<p>I of course just put the mask under my chin since public safety officers were stopping people and sneaking they put them on. Turns out no one gives a damn as long as they see the color blue or white around your mouth area.</p>

        <p>The lack of common sense and critical thinking are becoming the normal, why? Maybe it’s all the bullshit that gets shoved through their eye holes via their phones. So much fake ass bullshit that most people consume without ever thinking about anything, they just believe it without any research at all. It’s the same reason workers compensation says there’s no such thing as common sense anymore, because people are so stupid and shortsighted they don’t think something will happen to them if they put their hand under a moving saw for example. I’ve seen that happen a few times and it comes down to so many of these people not thinking about the potential results of their actions or thinking “it won’t happen to me.” The media/government doesn’t help at all by manipulating these people with fear and anxiety and trying to normalize this behaviour.</p>

        <p>20 year old here. I just don’t really understand why my friends follow what they’ve been told so faithfully and without question. They’re so into all of this bullshit and I’ve just become more alienated from them as the months go on. </p>
<p>We went out for breakfast a week ago ( group of 5 ) and after, we all stood outside in the parking lot to chat some more after. They were all wearing masks in the parking lot and we were all out in the open. There was literally no point in doing so, maybe it’s because I’m not vaccinated, but we were also sitting close proximity to each other in the restaurant. I don’t understand the logic.</p>

        <p>They're scared, whether they admit it or not, and view each other and you as potential health hazards. I know it's a shitty realization, but they've been brainwashed, and don't have the mental capacity to come to their own conclusions. I won't tell you not to hang out with them, though it's pretty clear to me they are terrified of the virus, and they may turn on you if they suspect you might put their lives in danger.</p>

        <p>I think this perfectly highlights what Edward Snowden was talking about when he exposed the levels of government and corporate surveillance.</p>
<p>But people misunderstand the surveillance part; it's not about surveillance at all, it's about control. And the age bracket you quote are the perfect example of state control working as desired.</p>

        <p>Sadly a lot of boomers are following along with the stupid mandates, but not all of us. I think you are part of the problem by clumping us all together and throwing us out of your “cool group.”  Part of being a critical thinker is understanding that any time you generalize you are diluting your results. Come join the free thinkers and leave your prejudices behind. Power to all the thinkers and dissenters.</p>

        <p>I agree it's bad. On tinder, countless girls feel the need to have in their bios that their vaccinated, mask propaganda, "if u like trump swipe left", and bullshit like that. It's mind boggling. The virus has no effect on our age group and they do it because they're so brainwashed by msm and twitter and all that crap. It's sad</p>

        <p>My husband and I took our 3 kids to the local tulip festival last week. Gorgeous spring day, fresh air, thousands and thousands of every type and color of tulip spread out over 50 acres. 9 out of 10 people wearing f-ckin masks. OUTSIDE. Spread out nowhere near others! I’m starting to hate everyone.</p>

        <p>This is the example of decline of standards in college education. Some will say that’s part of Marxist “walk through institutions”, some says it’s natural.
Regardless, for a successful brainwashing you must keep the victim from finding out, or even if they found out, afraid to speak out.</p>
<p>That’s where bullshit college education comes in. You get a useless degree but also you are told you are better than uneducated people. That whatever bullshit you hear at uni it’s good and educated, and whatever everyone’s else says it’s not.
You end up with a paper which shows your own self important and mental scar, that if you ever disagree you are stupid.
Now even if you would like to think different... you are condition not to. </p>
<p>Resemblance with religions and cults?</p>
<p>And of course, I know there are still important and good unis which value knowledge and science, as there always been.
But they at all put in the same basket</p>

        <p>This virus has unleashed a plethora of weak willed individuals that has given them the perfect opportunity to virtue signal with their mask wearing.  Since these people blindly trust their authority, they believe they are doing a virtuous act by wearing the mask.  When you tell someone that they're protecting others from a disease in which you may not have symptoms of, that is classic Pavlov operant conditioning at its finest.  What a sad state of affairs we live in.  I took mine off 9 months ago, and never looked back.  In fact, I burned my masks except for one.  I am keeping it just as a reminder of the stupidity that we subject ourselves to.</p>

        <p>I think this is excessive generational hate. Zoomer here. I really believe that in all of human history there has always been a really small percentage of people who are actually smart. I would guess like 2-5% maybe? If you're not in that percentage, you are extremely prone to going along with whatever the majority thinks. I think this is true for every generation.</p>

        <p>Two of the most well-read critical-thinking young people I met in my life were high school dropouts. One of them was making over 6 figures at the age of 19 as he was a prodigious computer programmer. Education is indoctrination - you're far enough in to where you should get your degree and get out forever unless in the future you're going for a practical degree with utility.   </p>
<p>Remember in the Wizard of Oz when Scarecrow asked for a brain and they gave him a degree? He was still brainless but now he had a piece of paper that represented the contrary. Most of the pomp and circumstance is just theater and employers are starting to catch on. Still, a degree might give you a slight edge but it's definitely not worth the inflated price.</p>

        <p>Same age. Maybe it has something to do with where you're at but everyone says they see maskers everywhere. I see some maskers, usually elderly, or families, etc. But almost nobody here is wearing a mask. And although we have had a lot of people in this area vaccinated, there's a huge percentage of us who ... hm, what do we call ourselves here? If they're woke, are we truthers? Idk. Whatever. There's a lot of us where I'm at.</p>

        <p>I honestly can't imagine. It seems like it's getting to be actually dangerous to be different in a situation like that. Just know that there are places, like here in Texas, where there are a lot of people who agree with us, or don't give a shit, which is better than agreeing with doomers.</p>

        <p>First of all, I think it's a form of herd behaviour. Especially with the younger ones who don't want to stand out of the group, who have low self-esteem. In schools it always was a common problem. And now with this global 'pandemic' people are quickly startled by people who don't obey the rules.</p>
<p>Secondly it's becoming a fashion statement. It sounds stupid, but seriously. Have you noticed that people even have masks on their profile picture on Social media? It's not only to show they take the covid rules seriously, but also a form of fashion. All the rainbows, colours, patterns, glitters, polka dots are on these masks. It looks like people are enjoying it just like your average piece of clothing.</p>

        <p>I was in a playground with my kid and there was an unmasked mom forcing her 1-2yo baby to wear a mask... every 5 minutes I could hear her say "fix your mask", because the baby's nose was out.</p>
<p>Like, fuck you... even if you are a crazy masker and you want to force your baby to wear a mask AT LEAST wear a mask yourself too to show the kid that you are in it together... dont force the toddler to wear a mask while you are unmasked.</p>
<p>People are fucking crazy nowadays... legit lost their minds.</p>

        <p>You realise repeatedly calling the opposing viewpoint, brainwashed and stupid, sort of ironically hinders your ability for critical thinking? Some rightists dispose of opposing views as socialists, some leftists dipose them as Nazi's. If you too frequently use this mentality, you lose the ability to whatsoever objectively percieve contradictory information.   </p>
<p>Ive seen so many people on this sub talk about removing themselves from family, other social media platforms because they do not promote their opinion. This is what you call putting yourself in an echo chamber.  </p>
<p>I see only generalisations on this subreddit.  Other people 'dont do their own research.' 'cant see through it all' 'are brainwashed'.<br>

        <p>I know how you feel. I'm 26 and even from a young age I've never considered myself to be the same generation as my "peers" </p>
<p>Most new people I meet put me around 35+ just based on how I speak and act. Then I have the opposite problem when I mistake people my own age for being under 18. The differences between us are scary somtimes.</p>

        <p>You’re correct that it’s a lack of critical thinking. As a 25 year old young man, I see that most of my contemporary peers sincerely lack this capacity. In large part, the educational system is failing them. Jordan Peterson said one of the primary reasons one attends university is to develop the ability to listen to people who annoy you, on the off chance that they have something to tell you “that you can use instead of dying.” Instead, political correctness has prevailed and much of our generation lacks the emotional fortitude to be told they’re wrong, let alone the curiosity and desire to understand exactly why they might be.</p>

Also celebs making photos in "fancy" masks making it something that is supposed to be "cool". Also posts like "1 jab closer to normal life"... oh well</p>

        <p>This is true, unfortunately.  And it confuses me to no end.  This is the age when people tend to be most rebellious.  A long time ago, when I was that age, I was NOT a rebellious person.  I was lockstep on track in career mode.  Dressed the part, went by the rules.  I got angry and rebellious a bit late, but that’s my life story: always late.</p>
<p>Can’t figure it out.  An entire generation, with a minority that still rebel, and thank God for them.</p>

        <p>It's their first chance to "be part of something", "make a difference", "be a good example", yadda yadda, and they don't wanna fuck it up. They want to be perceived as "good citizens", likely because they are purposeless and lack a strong sense of sense. I am 23, and our generation has a SEVERE problem with purpose and individuality, so I assume that this blind obedience is trying to partially fill that void. Just my theory</p>

        <p>My observation so far is that it has more to do with if they live in reality or a fantasy world. I work in software development for a web application, and the ability to shape a fictional world (the web application) can mess with the concept of reality. All fictional worlds can do this including internet social media. The less a person spends failing and accepting their limits in the real world, the more that person acts as if the real world is against them. "Why can I not control reality when I can control my among us character?"</p>

        <p>It's not about being dumb, it's about fitting in. The majority of people will sacrifice truth to avoid being ostracized, especially in that age group. The only way to get people to stop wearing masks is to make it cool not to, and anti-maskers have been doing a pretty terrible job at that.</p>

        <p>I went to college with people who were illiterate. Seriously. That's when you realize, at least for a state college, that the essay you write to get in is pointless because they clearly just let anyone in. The amount of dumb people I was around in college, even before this mess, was eye opening. College isn't for smart people at all, anymore. It's high school 2.0.  Makes sense, too, when you graduate and realize your bachelors is almost meaningless to employers. Most have to get a Masters now to be taken seriously.</p>

        <p>People dont get their information from the same places, so frankly, they are ignorant to anything. Plus we have been told to always believe what the adults say, so its hard to question anything when you can get detention.</p>

        <p>This post seems ridiculous to me. It's like wearing glasses. Sure I only find the need for them in the classroom, but when you wear something frequently you don't think about it. Sometimes i take off my glasses when I go outside, same with my mask, its not a big deal. You cant see this and conclude with brainwashing.</p>

        <p>What is the issue with other people wearing a mask outside? It doesn’t affect you if they do it or not, right? Maybe they know it doesn’t matter but it makes other people more comfortable. I guess I’m just kind of confused and would like to know the other side</p>

        <p>I don’t have an issue with someone who wants to wear a mask. I’m not going to say anything to anyone who does that, I’m not going to say anything to anyone who wants to get a vaccine, I just don’t like being told that I have to. </p>
<p>It just doesn’t make sense to me to wear a mask outside with no one around. The last year i have suffered mentally because of being isolated and away from campus, and people my age are just giving in to whatever the government says and not even questioning it. it’s frustrating</p>

        <p>You’re right, I understand what you’re saying. I shouldn’t care if someone wants to wear a mask outside with no one around. I guess i’m just frustrated because it feels like i’m the only one my age who wants all of this to end</p>

        <p>No one wants to challenge you. You're in an echo chamber and I don't give a fuck about this sub. You post on some questionable subreddits as it is so maybe consider this a second chance before you go balls deep in to maga territory.</p>
<p>Perhaps you should critically think as to how you could be wrong. What about your own personal bias? have you removed that as a factor from your judgment or is your prophetic vision so corrupted from your hormones that the only thing you can concentrate on is how to fall in love instead of focus on school? Which is it? Maybe you can't have both, or maybe you can? The fact of the matter is that it's all your subjective experience until it isn't. Until you come across someone with basic rudimentary information provided to them by trusted medical professionals. And yet you would probably wonder, how on Earth could you be wrong? After all, YOU think critically why can't other people think for themselves??</p>
<p>You know why? Because most people don't care about your opinion, because you probably have no influence over them, because brainwashing isn't a thing unless you're a literal coomer trying to justify your right to express your poor judgment in risk analysis. So, that's what a Rutgers education gets you? Is your daddy proud? just PASSING grades? Poor analytical skills still ignorant no grammar.</p>
<p>Live a life worth living, try to be less of a piece of shit, and leave the world a better place than how you found it. Keep learning important shit. Congrats I just saved you like $20k worth of a semester of learning.</p>
<p>It's not about what college you went to. Plenty of people arent privileged enough for that opportunity. Go get challenged and get humble and get the fuck off this cesspool subreddit because your mere presence here spreads disinformation.</p>

        <p>Well, I can’t speak for everyone else, but it’s much easier to put on a mask and leave it on when I run my errands then needing to be vigilant about every person who comes near so that I would need to put my mask back on. I can’t imagine the logistics of putting on a mask while riding a bike is particularly safe. </p>
<p>As for critical thinking, my thought process goes: minor inconvenience of wearing a mask &lt; reducing the potential of transmitting a disease I have of contracting a disease I don’t.</p>

        <p>Have you done any research into this?
There’s zero cases of asymptomatic transmission; healthy people who aren’t infected are not transmitting covid. That was determine me by a study of 10m on covid from wuhun. </p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695</p>
<p>And even if it was possible for healthy ppl to spread it, masks don’t prevent covid. Particulates are too small and the mask can’t catch them. Here’s a danish study- https://fee.org/articles/new-danish-study-finds-masks-don-t-protect-wearers-from-covid-infection/ the link to the data is within the article. </p>
<p>Please don’t obey just for the sake of obeying. Know your facts and risks and don’t do things that result in loss of freedoms. Like showing your face.</p>

        <p>How the fuck can someone be brainwashed to <em>not</em> do something. That doesn’t make any sense. Like you people keep calling <em>us</em> the “cultists” or whatever. </p>
<p>What scenario is closer to Jim Jones? (the largest cult in modern American history)</p>
<p>A.) people lining up to be test subjects for a vaccine </p>
<p>B.) people saying “nah, I’m healthy, I’m good with not getting the vaccine.”</p>

        <p>If you're wearing a mask outside you're the one is who is brainwashed. If you put in .01% of your brainpower in thinking about it you'd realize it makes no sense how you could catch covid outside. The virus isn't just going to float there. The wind and weather is going disperse into a thinly spread area. If you breathe in few virus particles it's not going to do anything to you. You have to breath a certain amount of viruses in order to become infected.</p>
