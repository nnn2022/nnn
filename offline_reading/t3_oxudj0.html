        <p>"The reason for hospitalization and the age of the child at the time were not determined, but the latter finding appears consistent with a study of 38,801 reports to the VAERS of infants who were hospitalized or had died after receiving vaccinations. The study reported a linear relationship between the number of vaccine doses administered at one time and the rate of hospitalization and death; moreover, the younger the infant at the time of vaccination, the higher was the rate of hospitalization and death"</p>

        <p>This is vaccinated vs unvaccinated. As in...completely unvaccinated since birth.</p>

<p>Vaccinated people develop more chronic conditions than those that never have any vaccines.</p>

        <p>&rt;A cross-sectional <strong>study of mothers of children educated at home</strong></p>
<p>This is like intentionally choosing a selection bias and throws up red flags immediately</p>
<p>&rt;was carried out in collaboration with homeschool organizations in four U.S. states: Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oregon. </p>
<p>..as well as a self-selection bias</p>
<p>&rt;Mothers were asked to complete an anonymous online questionnaire</p>
<p>This is the way to obtain garbage results, by the way</p>
<p>&rt;on their 6- to 12-year-old biological children with respect to pregnancy-related factors, birth history, vaccinations, physician-diagnosed illnesses, medications used, and health services. NDD, a derived diagnostic measure, was defined as having one or more of the following three closely-related diagnoses: a learning disability, Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. </p>
<p>separating this because it makes the whole thing sound like a troll anyway</p>
<p>&rt;A convenience sample of <strong>666</strong> children was obtained, of which 261 (39%) were unvaccinated. </p>
<p>random number for no reason at all, surely</p>
<p>&rt;The vaccinated were <strong>less</strong> likely than the unvaccinated to have been diagnosed with chickenpox and pertussis, but <strong>more</strong> likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia, otitis media, allergies and NDD. After adjustment, vaccination, <strong>male gender, and preterm birth</strong> remained significantly associated with NDD. However, in a final adjusted model with interaction, vaccination but not preterm birth remained associated with NDD, while the interaction of preterm birth and vaccination was associated with a 6.6-fold increased odds of NDD (95% CI: 2.8, 15.5). In conclusion, vaccinated <strong>homeschool</strong> children were found to have a higher rate of allergies and NDD than unvaccinated homeschool children. While vaccination remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, preterm birth coupled with vaccination was associated with an apparent synergistic increase in the odds of NDD. Further research involving larger, independent samples and stronger research designs is needed to verify and understand these unexpected findings in order to optimize the impact of vaccines on children’s health.</p>
<p>Emphasis is mine.  This is a correlative study and while interesting it shows almost-nothing except that it would be worthwhile to study the idea further.  This is how you apply for funding grants.  To say that it is high quality conclusive evidence of anything is a stretch at best.  I think the far more interesting bit is </p>
<p>&rt;No significant differences were seen with regard to hepatitis A or B, high fever in the past 6 months, measles, mumps, meningitis (viral or bacterial), influenza, or rotavirus</p>
<p>It also seems to imply that being partially vaccinated is worse in some cases than being fully vaccinated.  That tells me a lot more study of a lot more people is required to draw any conclusions as well. It also seems to imply that vaccinated children go to the doctor more, which could correlate very strongly (with further study!) to being diagnosed more frequently with illness.  To their credit, these issues are addressed by the authors and they end with </p>
<p>&rt;Nevertheless, the study findings should be interpreted with caution. First, additional research is needed to replicate the findings in studies with larger samples and stronger research designs. Second, subject to replication, potentially detrimental factors associated with the vaccination schedule should be identified and addressed and underlying mechanisms better understood. Such studies are essential in order to optimize the impact of vaccination of children’s health.</p>

        <p>This is a pretty strange article. It’s saying all vaccines, not just the Covid vaccines. I’m against the Covid vaccine because there’s been no long term testing. It typically takes years to develop and test vaccines before being approved. Yet somehow we had 4 separate in 7 months. Then the government issues blanket immunity for the developers. That raises a lot of red flags for me. I’m not anti vaccine, I’m anti THIS vaccine.</p>

        <p>What if I told you...</p>
<p>the government issues blanket immunity for the developers of ALL vaccines...</p>
<p>Just sayin...the same thing they're doing to spread disinformation about this vaccine is what they've been using for years.</p>
