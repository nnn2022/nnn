    <strong>For all those that believe that the government is just trying to control us</strong>
    <p><p>I am genuinely curious why you believe that either this global pandemic is a hoax so the government can control us, or that it's greatly exaggerated so the government can control us. If its all about government control then why is it that people all over the world are saying the same things? Why would people in the uk for example care about how much control the US government has over citizens? Or vise versa.</p>
<p>Please note that I am not trying to attack or belittle anyone here, I want to understand what leads you to think these things and just want to have a civil discussion</p></p>

        <p>&rt;If its all about government control then why is it that people all over the world are saying the same things?</p>
<p>Because those governments are controlled by the same people. Countries are not a collection of independent nation-states, they are economic zones which global oligarchs use to extract wealth. The <strong>people</strong> in all nations are in a united front against these nefarious forces. Governments are not inherently evil, they are like machines. However when the people who run them are evil, then they will be used for evil purposes.</p>

        <p>The previous time something like this occurred, it was all about terrorism. Constant fear of an invisible outside enemy in order to exert control over people so changes in laws regarding surveillance, security, and monetary policy could be ushered in without people revolting. </p>
<p>This time it's all about bio-security. The virus is the enemy. It's invisible and it's not going away. Your neighbor could have it. Your family could be infected. Control will be consolidated on a global/international level. There will still be "countries" and "states," and they will all be tied to a burgeoning global control grid. You are always surveilled and everything you need to operate in this world will be digitized. There will be one global currency tied to carbon usage. You can't travel unless you can prove you're not a bio-security risk.</p>

        <p>The virus is real and is was created by the US and China working together. Everything that has happened after that fact is the consequence of some person, group, or entity looking to profit off of the virus. Vaccine makers cash in. "News" sites ratchet up the panic and generate clicks. Politicians crank down on people to look tough, and people support it like animals. Distillers stop making vodka, and make hand sanitizer. Etc...</p>
<p>But the bigger picture is that all politicians at the highest levels are all truly puppets the global elite. The mega-uber-ultra-rich. Dynastic wealth handed down for generations and generations. These elite own countries. Entire economic sectors. Their only desire is to control as much as they can as fast as they can to protect themselves from you: the slave. You do not live in a democracy. It's all a puppet show to make you feel like you have agency. You are a slave. Regular slaves like you and me realize the global system is fragile and we can never get a share comparable to theirs. There are a lot of us. We could change the system, so the elite perform these orchestrated and controlled demolitions of our lives so we can only focus on our immediate survival. They also create "parties" that we "vote" for to keep us fighting amongst each other like it was a football game, rather than direct our energies toward our true problem: them.</p>

        <p>Every institution gets corrupted by money. Charities, colleges, hospitals
, non profits... and also global health organizations like the WHO. </p>
<p>Gates gives as much to the WHO as the US Gov. He just so happens to be the one building vaccine factories too and expecting a massive return. When in doubt, follow the money.</p>

        <p>Every year we have a flu season.  Every year there are waves (stages) of the flu.  Every year people die from it, unfortunately, particularly those who are elderly or in poor health.</p>
<p>How many of those years have we all been ordered into our homes and told when we can or cannot leave the house and for what reasons we can do so?  How many times were businesses forced to close?  How many times have great swaths of the population been forced into poverty by these measures?</p>
<p>How many times were the sick placed directly into nursing homes and other facilities with the elderly which, to any thinking mind, should be a phenomenally bad idea.</p>
<p>How many times were people told that they will not be able to work, buy food, or travel without constant testing and an eventual immunization?</p>

        <p>Also, the reason I gave you grief for calling yourself a citizen is simple: you're a person, a human being, first and foremost before you're a "citizen" owing allegiance to any government. Do not ever let an authority tell you otherwise.  You're an individual human being with inalienable rights as one.</p>
<p>This fact is also pivotal to the information I hope you find if you research.</p>

<p>agenda 2030's main goals are a carbon tax (done), eliminating privately owned ICE autos (nearly done) and a 'global ID'</p>

<p>Why? This is what I'm trying to understand. How do you know the restrictions are effective? How do you know they're worth doing? Where's the data?</p>
<p>&rt; Right now covid isn't that dangerous, but it is very infectious and mutates twice as fast as influenza, so there is a possibility of it becoming more dangerous to more people</p>
<p>This is nonsense. Viruses mutate to become <em>less</em> deadly.</p>

        <p>To answer the first part, we know that masks and social distancing help prevent the spread of the virus because it is airborne and can also be passed through skin to skin contact </p>
<p>And the second part, while that is true, virus mutations are often unpredictable, especially when they mutate as often as covid, there is a possibility that it could mutate to become more deadly, even if it is a small one, I would personally rather not take the risk</p>

        <p>&rt;To answer the first part, we know that masks and social distancing help prevent the spread of the virus because it is airborne and can also be passed through skin to skin contact</p>
<p>No, they don't. For the same reason we will never get rid of influenza or common cold viruses. 1. Highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses spread fast. No masks or lockdowns or social distancing or other voodoo is going stop them. This is why these measures have all completely failed. 2. Highly contagious, mild respiratory viruses simply have an extremely high number of people who contract them and either have very mild symptoms or are completely asymptomatic, allowing them to go unnoticed for a long period of time. Since the vast majority of people won't have anything more than the sniffles, you don't really notice much going on, except a few more elderly people dying. This doesn't raise any alarms...just think about it, if China had never announced this to the world, and the U.S. didn't purposefully inflate the death count, would anyone even notice that we were in a "global pandemic"? Nope. By the time you even notice the virus is there, it's already far too late to do anything to stop it even if you could...because by that time the virus has already taken hold and will at that point keep spreading until herd immunity is reached. This is why it's so infuriatingly stupid that people actually believe this virus just magically appeared in the U.S. in March. That's not how it works. By the time the March mass psychosis started, the virus had already been spreading for months. Testing, isolating, and contract tracing, which works great for high IFR, low R0 viruses, is complete quackery when dealing with these types of viruses.</p>

        <p>Flu is not a single virus. There are several different flu strains and some we're better able to vaccinate against than others. Anyhow, I don't know why we're arguing about facts. See: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-tamiflu-vaccine">this article on the swine flu from 2009:</a></p>
<p>&rt; There is good reason to suspect the [swine flu] virus will become less lethal as it spreads. The virus is constantly mutating, and the strains that will spread fastest are the ones that do not stop people going about their daily lives and coming into contact with others. The most lethal viruses tend to be short-lived because they kill their host before the virus has had a chance to be passed on.</p>

        <p>The flu vaccine is not very effective. In 2018 hospitals across the US were actually overwhelmed and patients had to be treated in tents due to the flu - yet we had a vaccine for it.  Why didn't we lockdown, mask up and start social distancing in 2018?  What makes covid any different at all?</p>

        <p>Do you really think that after all these years of degrading and debasing us physically, spiritually, psychologically and socially that THIS TIME they really care about our health? Look up Agenda 21. Look up the 45 declared goals of the communist party. Event 201, Operation Dark Winter, all of these organizations and agendas have the primary purpose of establishing totalitarian control over everything you do and say. There is no depth to the evil in this world and psychopaths flock to positions of power in both the government and the private sector. Power is a drug and like with any drug, you build up tolerance, you need more and more to achieve the same effect.</p>

        <p>The most logical explanation I can think of, is that most politicians are simply doing whatever they think will get them re-elected. They are pandering to their base. One of the most importance psychological/economical ideas is incentive structures. People operate based on incentives.</p>
<p>Politicians are incentivized to appeal to their bases. This is why they get caught lying so often, telling the truth isnt in their best interest.</p>
<p>Scientists are incentivized to research/study the topics that will further their career. This can mean, but doesnt necessitate, searching for the truth.</p>

        <p>No. In these times, Its more wise to think pragmatically as opposed to scientifically. Unless you have a highly collective-minded society, then masks were doomed to fail, regardless of what the science says.</p>
<p>A basic human right would be bodily autonomy. You decide what clothing you wear, whether you accept physical touch from another, you decide where you're physically going, you decide with whom you associate, what physical labour you will/wont perform. Masks are a violation of bodily autonomy. Freedom of choice is paramount.</p>

        <p>Ok, let's look back before the pandemic, if a surgeon were to preform surgery on someone without wearing a mask, what would the reaction be? People would be rioting, there would be an uproar against this surgeon, so why is it that when it comes to everyday civilians wearing masks that its against human rights?</p>

        <p>During surgery, the surgeon could be operating on your open body. Any germs the surgeon has goes right into your body. It stops saliva or other particles from going directly into your body. Also these are clean, medical-grade surgical masks, not old, used, disgusting pieces of fabric people are using.</p>
<p>For common respiratory viruses we have never hid in fear behind masks. Even in severe flu seasons. Because masks don’t help. A virus will spread no matter what. We’ve also never locked down before. Because once you lock down, any easing in restrictions, even just a little bit, will lead to more cases. You need to let a virus, particularly a new one, spread so immunity is developed. Sheltering the vulnerable while letting the healthy develop immunity is how you do this. Not by wearing masks, locking down, killing businesses, destroying livelihoods, ruining mental health, etc. while waiting for a rushed vaccine that we have no idea what the long term affects could be.</p>

        <p>Walmart and Target were still open because they were considered essential businesses since they sell food and other necessities. This isn't the first election with mail in ballots, it has been done before. Other than those two things I can see the logic behind what you are saying, I don't completely agree with what you're saying, but I respect your right to say and think it</p>

        <p>The virus is real the threat is not. The entire panic was started as a way to tank the economy and take Trump out. Then governments realized "Hey we can really expand our power under this fake threat." Then is snowballed and is still snowballing, now they are not sure what to do. It did the original job it was intended to do but the media and government became so invested in the panic no one is sure what to do now.</p>
<p>I suspect by Mid-March the vaccine will roll out and everyone will magically stop talking about COVID. No more death counts, phony crying nurse videos, freedom passes or the like. Like H1N1 it was just go away.</p>

        <p>No, did you read what I said? The Virus is real, the panic over it was manufactured to try to destroy Trump. Sure people died of it, just like they died of H1N1 and Swine/Bird Flu, regular Flu. We didn't torpedo the economy over those, we didn't take away people's Freedom in the name of "safety" we tell people who and who couldn't go to work or run their businesses. </p>
<p>The actual death numbers are BS and we will never know the real numbers. Anyone who tests positive for COVID is listed as a COVID death regardless of their actually cause of death. Here is Colorado over the summer they quietly revised the COVID death number down 25%. That is one state.</p>
<p>The scare mongering all the "experts" assured was real never appeared. Hospitals never got overrun, no one ran out of ventilators, millions of people never died. It was all nonsense to destroy Trump.</p>

        <p>That is where I disagree, Trump was an idiot and didn't take it seriously at all, not to mention, he kinda destroyed himself when he told all of his supporters to vote twice, which is voter fraud. He literally told people to commit voter fraud so he'd win. Also, why would the rest of the world care if he was reelected? Why would the rest of the world say the same things if this was all to destroy Trump?</p>
