    <strong>Look. I like trump, but this has gone too far. I have no idea what is happening with him, but he’s acting strange.</strong>
    <p><p>ss: If he’s really “in on it” and here to destroy the deep state, why does he like the vaccines so much? It’s disturbing to me that he wanted to help the people and then he suddenly flipped. Like.... I know he’s always had an issue with bragging, but this is going really far. I always thought he was great until he started acting really sketchy lately. </p>
<p>His recent statement:
“Isn’t it incredible because of the vaccines, which I and my Administration came up with years ahead of schedule (despite the fact that everyone, including Fauci, said would never happen) that we no longer need masks, and yet our names are not even mentioned in what everyone is calling the modern day miracle of the vaccines? Without the vaccines, this world would have been in for another 1917 Spanish Flu, where up to 100 million people died. Because of the vaccine we pushed and developed in record time, nothing like that would even be close to happening. Just a mention please! The Biden administration had zero to do with it. All they did was continue our plan of distribution, which was working well right from the beginning!”</p>
<p>There are a few odd things I want to point out about this statement. 
The fact that he said “CAME UP WITH years ahead of schedule” when covid-19 has only been around for 1 year was strange. And the fact that he said “pushed and developed in record time” goes against all of the things trump supposedly was doing to help the people and to destroy the deep state. 
There has been a big character change since 2016 to now, and I’m not sure if it is his age combined with his inflated ego on being president, or if he has been brainwashed or replaced. Again, he’s always had an issue with bragging (probably bc he’s a business man and it’s a tactic) but this has gotten incredibly strange and kind of evil sounding. 
I don’t know what to think anymore. Alex Jones is also upset about the way trump is behaving regarding the vaccines. He is saying he won’t vote for him again if he doesn’t come out against them. Looks like Alex won’t vote for him, and I’m sure his popularity will significantly drop with this sudden change in character. Just something to think about.</p></p>

        <p>I hope the day comes when people realize the fight is between us, the people, and the corrupt establishment politicians who have drained and destroyed the place we call home. And, I hate to break it to everyone, Donald Trump is not on our team. I am not going to get into all the reasons why in this forum but, he isn't the answer everyone thinks he is. He was used to accomplish an objective, just like every president is. He served his purpose. We are more divided, therefore much weaker as a people, than we have ever been. </p>
<p>Until we the people accept the truth about what we must do, remove every establishment politician and start over from scratch, we will continue to deteriorate.  It sounds unrealistic and absurd but, its too late for anything less. They are a cancer that has taken over everything and they are very close to killing what remains. The cancer has to be removed. Its the only way.</p>

        <p>Trump never wanted to help the people.</p>
<p>He’s been the most successful controlled opposition operation in history bar none.</p>
<p>None of the current branch covidian environment would have been possible without him intentionally being painted to be the bad guy to the left for 4 years AND so many of his supporters falling for transparent Qanon psyop that got them to sit on their hands while he destroyed this country last year.</p>
<p>He could have ended the state of emergency, fired fauci last April, and pointed out all the numerous effective treatments instead of rushing a “vaccine” program that was never needed. The most he did was mention HCQ and then it played into the hands of the cultists as the NIH rigged a study basically saying it was ineffective. He could have invested resources into showing the statistical fraud of the covidians. He could have done so much more. If he was your friend.</p>
<p>Trump was never your friend. He said a lot of good things in 4 years and theoretically appeared better than the democrats at times but make no mistake—he was always controlled opposition.</p>

        <p>Trump doesn't really know much, which is why he thought being president meant something in the first place, he also supports 5G, he's been made into something he's not by his fans or whatever. I'd say he knows like 5-10% of the truth</p>

        <p>A good question. I see the danger of covid 19 vaccines in an upcoming ADE effect, but there is also the possibility left, that the vaccine isn’t about covid but to prepare for a biological warfare... but we don’t know who is kidding whom in the background... one thing is for sure in my opinion: they tell us not the truth</p>

        <p>Trump was a useful idiot in this sense, though he originally wasn’t a part of the plan. He derailed the WEF/Club of Rome/Bilderberg people for a few years, but they eventually realized they could use his presidency to their advantage, as far as the vax was concerned.</p>
