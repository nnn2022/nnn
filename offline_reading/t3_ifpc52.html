        <p>The problem isn’t so much businesses requiring masks, but governments requiring businesses to require masks. Leave it up to businesses to decide, and customers to decide if they’d rather go to the places that do or don’t require masks. But in many places, businesses legally have to require masks or they could get fined. So wrong.</p>

        <p>Yup all it takes is one annoying middle aged bitch to see the sign, take a pic, post it all over social media, and let the morally righteous mob take over. This usually leads to tons of fraudulent bad reviews on Google and usually multiple people report them to the state. It's just sad to feel like you ever need to do something like that.</p>
<p>Hilariously, WA state leaked their "snitch list" back in April (if I'm remembering right) and it had peoples real names and address. Shit really hit the fan and I think people stopped reporting because they're afraid of the backlash</p>

        <p>And it's always the middle-aged, at least in my experience. I'd understand the genuinely elderly being concerned, and I'd understand if so many of these people weren't obese or otherwise ill as a result of certain lifestyle choices, but I find it hard to believe they're truly so afraid of the virus when they never cared about their health before. They're on a power trip and/or trying to be trendy.</p>

        <p>Where I live there is no State Mandate, nor is there a County Mandate. But the individual Towns/Cities that make up the County have their own rules.  My town mandates masks in businesses and in Town operated buildings.  Last week I went into one of those buildings to vote. I carried a mask...  I didn't wear it, but I had it in my hands. No one gave me any crap.  The security guy who opened the door for me so that I wouldn't have to touch a potentially virus laden door handle wasn't wearing a mask.  </p>
<p>There is a Sam's Club about twenty minutes away from me. To get there I drive through communities with and without a mask mandate.  The Sam's Club is in a city that mandates masks.  On my last three trips there over the course of a month I was greeted once by a Sam's employee who asked if I had a mask... I said no... she held out a box...  I took one and put it in my pocket.  I lost that mask somewhere in the store.  The second time there were two employees at the door. The same scenario... except as I tucked the mask into my shirt pocket and walked into the store she yelled at me... <em>"You have to wear it!"</em>  I kept walking and shopped with the mask in my pocket.  The last time I was there they had a menacing Security Guard in an official looking uniform....</p>
<p>Guard:  Do you have a mask sir?</p>
<p>Me: No</p>
<p>Guard: (holding out a box of masks) Would you like one?</p>
<p>Me: No</p>
<p>Guard:  OK... enjoy your day sir.</p>

        <p>Idk about you but my local Walmart has private security that circle the parking lot pretty much 24/7. We have a huge homeless population and lots of junkies stealing regularly. So I think for a lot of them, they already have a  security team on deck. That's not counting LP either. Walmart doesnt play.</p>

        <p>Same here. We also have one-way security gates, I guess so people can die in the next fire. Spoiler Alert: All those security measures are absolutely useless, theft and vandalism has only increased, can't find a single pack of panties that hasn't been pilfered from. I wonder how much gas those security guard waste driving around the parking lot all day....?</p>

        <p>Jfc wear one or don't, but creating a culture where people feel they can violently impose their will is dangerous. At this point I make a point to only hang out with people who are reasonable about it (masks in crowded indoor spaces) and don't care or take note of anyone else's mask compliance. </p>
<p>No, I don't care if Stacy is wearing a mask in the dog park. Do you really have that level of free time to care?</p>

        <p>I do t get why everyone is so hurt over wearing a mask for 5min to an hour while in a store. Really not that big of deal. I hate the things myself, fogs up my glasses. However, it’s temporary and don’t let something small like that effect my life in such a big way. If it makes people feel safe then I can swallow my pride for a few minutes. I’m surprised that there are so many people against wearing masks. As long as it doesn’t end up costing me money I don’t really care. In and out. </p>

        <p>When I went to study in China during the summer of 1993, I lived at the dormitory at Nankai University in Tianjin. You asked me to enlighten you to see something from another point of view, like how one thing can seem silly to do to another seem the opposite. When I looked out of my window in my room, I could see some shapes on the lawn that looked like little girls, but I couldn't tell what they were doing. Yet I heard a sound of repetitive movement of some type of labor. I had to go down the four flights of stairs to investigate. When I came closer I could see that it was two little girls around seven who were tasked with cutting the grass with long scissors. I asked their mother through an interpreter, who was supervising them, "Isn't it going to take them forever to cut the grass that way?" Because it was not a small swath of land. However, the woman had never been asked about the efficiency of the task before. So she did not answer the question but she did enjoy the attention to her girls. After that conversation and a lot like it, I began to see that my point of view was often not shared with the Chinese even though it seemed like an opinion that was easier to have. Hard work and obedience were far more important than how a task could be done more efficiently in 1993's China.</p>

        <p>I understand that for you it’s not a big deal, and if that’s the case, great. But for me, I’m someone who has always been a bit contrarian. I’ve always chafed at being forced to do something that doesn’t make logical sense to me. So yes, being forced to wear a mask is a big deal.</p>
<p>Even if masks were actually effective, I’ve already had Covid and am immune, so why should I be forced to wear it? I’m the last person who should be wearing but a mask. Encouraging mask use is one thing, forcing people when there are so many exceptions to this blanket rule is ridiculous. Exceptions include: people who are immune, people with PTSD related to masks or construction of breathing, people who have medical reasons for not constructing airflow. I’m sure there are more situations people can think of, but there needs to be room for exceptions.</p>
<p>Finally, even though masks theoretically make sense, the data doesn’t support mask usage. In California, where there are a lot of cities with high mask compliance, their cases are rising, while in places like Arizona with significantly less mask compliance, the cases a falling rapidly. In New York City, mask compliance is high and cases are very low, but the virus already burned through almost half the population here. If the data doesn’t support its efficacy, then governments that support mask mandates aren’t actually looking at the “science” they hold as sacrosanct.</p>

        <p>Great reply! I would have to agree with you then, great explanation. Yeah if that’s the case then and what’s going on there, I agree. WTF is up with that. Here in Canada there is no law yet but heavily encouraged. Walmart is trying to inforce it, mandatory masks. But many walk in without one. They can’t force people to. Luckily the infections were I leave are relatively low. Province wide there is maybe 200-300 total since the start that got infected. In my city there is only 2 known cases. I get were you are coming from. Thank you for the reply.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s insane, which is why it’s so easy to cherry pick the facts to fit a narrative since the data diverges so drastically from one place to another, to the point where if you humble it all together, no one narrative makes sense. The only thing you can conclude is that there really is nothing you can do aside from taking normal hygiene precautions — this virus will burn through the population no matter what you do.</p>
