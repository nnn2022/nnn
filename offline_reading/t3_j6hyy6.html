    <p><p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on mocking people who go out and enjoy their life/express themselves rather than being scared of a .001% chance of catching the flu</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on unironically thinking you're a good person for dictating how people are allowed to breathe </p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on afraid of a virus that is less deadly than your drive to work</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on believing the societal destruction caused by governments worldwide is justified</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on listening to the government tell you how much they care about your safety while they compensate hospitals for putting people on ventilators (yes I know all hospitals are super honest, genuinely care about their patients, and would NEVER put money before some random plebs life)</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on pretending xi, gates, soros, barry, cuomo, pelosti, biden, fauci, and all the other insufferable cunts of the new world are well meaning, kind, and in no way corrupt or dishonest. Only Orange Man Bad. </p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on hoping Orange Man gets caught J-Walking so you can out him in Gitmo where he belongs</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on refusing to acknowledge the laundry list of federal laws broken and endless wars perpetuated by the previous administration, disappointed that it didn't turn out to be the "generational war" King Shit had promised</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on praying to satan and mohammad the pedophile, begging them to kill the leader of the free world with cooties</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on for 8 years obsessing over a reality TV star with a spray tan, seething every time he accomplishes something good and magnifying each and every gaffe he's made in his entire 2 terms</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on wishing death to people who do not politically align with you, while simultaneously wearing a petri dish on your face to prove how much you care about others lives</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on watching depression, suicides, overdoses, and violent crimes skyrocket due to the measures you support</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on gleefully looking at pictures of NYC boarded up and shut down, happy that you no longer have to feel jealous of all your peers being more successful than you, now that their lifes work and business have been destroyed</p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on refusing to acknowledge that even the CDC's bullshit death count is basically non existent for normal healthy adults </p>
<p>&rt;Sitting in your house with a mask on slowly waiting to die because you're a fucking programmed pussy that has never stood up for yourself since none of your beliefs or convictions come from your own original thoughts. </p>
<p>Some people would rather fucking die than live in the future dystopia you're infatuated on supporting. 
Some people would rather die than be told how to fucking breathe. Some people would rather die than live on their fucking knees, sucking the cock of whatever commie piece of filth governer they're stuck with. 
Some people believe in self defense, free speech, and the pursuit of happiness. You, and everyone on this sub (moronavirus? that's literally the worst attempt at a pun I've ever seen) are dead set on destroying the very idea of freedom. 
You hate freedom. 
You hate happiness. 
You hate everyone that questions the obvious, endless, destructive scams your CIA handlers come up with. You're like a bunch of lost toddlers. "I'M A BIG BOY" you tell yourself. But as soon as you don't have mommy government there to help you think, you realize you're not a big boy after all and everything you ever believed was a lie. Even then though, you still will not admit you were wrong. You will lie to your own internal monologue, justifying "I just wanted to save peoples lives! I didn't realize I was destroying all that is good in this world!" </p>
<h1>YOU KNOW THE DAMAGE THIS IS CAUSING IS IRREVERSIBLE. IF YOURE AFRAID OF SHOPPING WITHOUT A DIAPER ON YOUR FACE, YOURE IN FOR A HELL OF A SURPRISE. YOUR ANCESTORS DIED BRUTALLY FIGHTING FOR THE FREEDOMS YOU ENJOY. WHY DONT YOU PRETEND YOU HAVE A PAIR AND CONTINUE THE FIGHT RATHER THAN SIDING WITH EVIL, YOU ABSOLUTE DEGENERATE BRAINWASHED LITERAL, FUCKING LITERAL NPC'S</h1>
