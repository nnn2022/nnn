    <strong>Monkey Pox</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer; I read some articles and then continued to make this post. After further research, a lot seems to be plain wrong. E.g. I state that a traveler entered the US yesterday, but other news outlets seem to have reported this issue days prior.
Please take everything here with a huge grain of salt and as always, do your own research.</p>
<p>As you may have read, two weeks ago, the CDC authorized a new vaccine that they say combats the monkey pox.
What's monkey pox you ask?
It's a virus causing fever, headaches etc. and turns your skin into bubble wrap.
The incubation period is about 10-14 days.
Its lethality dropped from a historical 20% to 1-2% in 1996. Human-to-Human transmission was rarely documented, but is theorized to occur through droplet infection.
Yesterday we read that a traveler got diagnosed with it returning to Texas. CDC said no need to worry.
Today they report that it's been spotted in 27 states with 200 cases and a lethality of 10%.
To get this straight: a disease that seldomly spreads from human to human suddenly becomes 10% more lethal, jumps to 200 other people in a single day and skips the incubation period entirely just two weeks after Dr Foocci and William Doors get their new jabs approved.
Ngl, the bubble wrap skin looks terrifiying.
What do you guys think?</p>
<p>Edit: apologies, it is not the CDC that approved a vaccine, but rather the FDA beginning the regulatory review period.</p></p>

        <p>My first thought, whenever any disease is potentially lethal, is ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the risk factor?‚Äù. I briefly skimmed the top results when I Googled ‚Äúmonkeypox‚Äù (CDC, WHO, some news articles, etc) and none of them went into detail about what makes one personally susceptible to severe infection, they only rattled off demographic statistics. ‚ÄúUp to 1 in 10 Africans die‚Äù...but are these populations healthy? Are they nutritionally deprived? What are their lifestyle habits, their sanitation levels? Have there been any deaths in the first world? </p>
<p>My second thought, after looking at some articles about the 200 people, is that <em>none of them are confirmed cases, yet</em>. They‚Äôre only tracking the 200 people who had close enough exposure to patient zero, and as far as I‚Äôm aware, none of them have been diagnosed with it as of yet. So hopefully this won‚Äôt actually be going anywhere. </p>
<p>Apparently there was a US outbreak in 2003 when prairie dogs got infected by imported rodents from Ghana, and people then bought those prairie dogs as pets (didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing, lol). None of the monkeypox cases were attributed to person-to-person contact, only contact with the infected pets. Presuming these people lived with family members, went shopping, etc. and didn‚Äôt manage to spread it, if any of these 200 people being tracked come down with Monkeypox after only a few hours on a flight with patient zero, I‚Äôd be very suspicious.</p>
