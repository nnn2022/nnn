    <strong>Some good news: not all localities are buying into the lockdown nonsense</strong>
    <p><p>For the purposes of not "outing" myself or my business partners I will be keeping business details and exact location private.</p>
<p>I own a bar in a New England state that has some of the silly covid restrictions (must be served food before a drink can be served, capacity limits etc). Our liquor permit never required us to serve food, and we don't have the space or capital to add a health department compliant kitchen, so under our states guidelines, we shouldn't be able to open.</p>
<p>However, we worked out a deal with our town that if we offered menus to the restaurants across the street, we'd be able to open. My call with the health department ended with them saying "it's on the (state agency who passed the guidelines) to enforce them, we won't be issuing fines." We had our annual health inspection last week and our inspector (who is also one of our customers) said the food requirement was nuts and that we have done more than enough to keep our customers safe (expanded outdoor seating with patio heaters, plexiglass in between tables inside).</p>
<p>We are quietly operating close to normal. Over the past few weeks, people from the tri-state area are coming by elated that they don't have to purchase a frozen pizza to have a beer.</p>
<p>There have been exactly 0 cases that could be traced back to us despite this. </p>
<p>Small businesses need your help. If you know of any that are defying draconian measures, make sure you visit them often.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, my family and I have been trying to support small businesses as much as possible. We eat out way more than we did pre-Covid. We really don't want our favorite restaurants to close.</p>

        <p>What does the food stipulation actually do to curb the spread? Have you seen people eat? They spit shit everywhere I thought we were worried about droplets?</p>

        <p>Speaking for NY, it’s a classist way of Cuomo saying I can only go out for a beer if it costs me $13, and not to go bar hopping because then I have to restart the food bill again. But breweries are exempt because they’re production facilities.</p>
<p>Also if they force you to sit down and eat food they’re forcing you to socially distance more than standing up with a drink.</p>
<p>Or as a friend of mine put it on FB when I dared question Saint Cuomo - “You shouldn’t be going out at all. He’s trying to make it so you don’t want to”</p>

        <p>Right on!  My gym operates against the “emergency” mandates and I’m there every chance I can get (monthly fee tho).  I’d 100% patronize a business like yours.</p>

        <p>This might seem like a victory with the health department, but let me tell you they are not your friends. As soon as their mortgage comes due, they’ll lock-step and fuck you over.</p>

        <p>In Ireland some bars did do the same collabs with restaurants during our first lockdown but coming out of the second they said no bar is allowed to open if they don’t have a kitchen. Now we are in our third lockdown ... no bars, restaurants or hairdressers / tattoo shops are open but non essential retail is. Baffles my mind with these rules!</p>
