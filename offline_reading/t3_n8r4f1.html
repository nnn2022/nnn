    <strong>Is it just me or people are getting more sick from the vaccines than COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>It seems that the vaccine is making people sicker than Covid itself., one example I can give is my aunt she had covid last year in september, and she had a really mild case that lasted 2 days.</p>
<p>Well 1 month ago she got the vaccine even tho she already had covid(don't ask me why) and when she got the 2nd dose, on the next day she woke up with chills, body aches, headache and a high fever, she was like that for a whole week but thankfully she got better.</p>
<p>So isn't this weird when she first got covid she didn't yave fever at all, and had a really mild case, but when she got the vaccines she was twice as much sick.</p>
<p>So doomers id you want to call me anti-vaxxer so be it, and you can also say this is anecdotal, but pretty much in all of my family's friend circle, everybody who got vaccinated got really sick, so it's clearlly not anecdotal.</p></p>

        <p>It's  a power trip for them. They are never going to take their own vaccines. They know it’s murder by injection. </p>
<p>Alex Jones: They're going to kill you. And they're going to love it, and you're going to love it... Do let me tell you again, get your kids all the shots.... Satan wants you to die and it's liberal, so die! But, first for it excruciatingly painfully, hahaha, so these corporations can suck ever darn dime out of you.  Bill Gates is better than you.  He rules you.  Die!  He walks into the facilities with the kids with the shaved heads all dying, he just feels good.  The power he's got to devastate and kill, devastate and kill.  Muder, death, slaughter, just knocking them down.  He gets up on Ted TV and says we're reducing the population to zero.  And the left goes, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 'Cause  their 'god' has taken them over and they're just going to kill everybody.  So, drink your fluoride, drink your glyphosate, take your shots, eat your gmos, and just do as you're told...</p>

        <p>The next 10 years are going to be pretty ugly. The US was designed to fall apart when we lost our Christian values, which, for the most part, I think we have.</p>
<p>They have more than just the vax up their sleeves. Our fiat currency is a ticking time bomb.  The hyperinflation has already started.They're already talking about the need for a new Bretton Woods.  This time, it'll be digital, so when they want to cancel you, they can cut off your access to your $$.</p>
<p>There's also going to be a bunch of "Cyber-Covid" false flags, food and supply shortages, power outages, etc.</p>

        <p>You might be right. When did we become a world of amoral narcissists?  </p>
<p>If you can, get about 100lbs of rice per family member and an equal amount of beans and store them well.  Also, get water, etc, and build from there.  I think they're going to mess with the supply chains.</p>

        <p>My aunt had covid kinda bad (not hospitalized but pretty sick) last November. She finished her two shots a month ago and apparently she’s been getting awful migraines and throwing up ever since. 
To people considering the vaccine- I think NOBODY who has HAD covid should get the shot. Also nobody with a history of migraines. Trust me on this one</p>

        <p>Maybe this is why they give it to the young people last and why it's split into 2 doses.</p>
<p>They know that young people are more likely to get worse side effects and it's also less easy to hide it if a young person keels over and dies a few days after vaccination. If an elderly person does this, they can easily call it a stroke or a heart attack that was going to happen anyway.</p>
<p>They know that the 2nd dose is more likely to cause a bad reaction than the first. So first you've got to get through vaccinating the old, the middle-aged, the medically vulnerable, and then first doses for the young. By the time you get to second doses for the young and healthy, just about everyone in the population has already been double needle-stuck. So the alarm (of serious adverse events appearing in significantly large numbers that they can't hide it anymore) won't go off until the job's already done.</p>
