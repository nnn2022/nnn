    <strong>It makes me sad</strong>
    <p><p>All the propaganda, all the false information. It leads only to pain and suffering. Such simple things can be easily done to make the lives of everyone way better. </p>
<p>And it makes me sad, sad for the people who buy this pseudoscientific bullshit, and who hivemind against common sense and proven research. </p>
<p>You people make me sad</p></p>

        <p>No, not really. It's just a little weird and slightly disappointing to see the things on this subreddit.

        <p>Obviously not what I meant, you're either purposefully misinterpreting me or youre misunderstanding</p>
<p>What I mean is that nurses and doctors have always had situations where they work monstrous hours of backbreaking work. Yes it's gotten more widespread with covid, but denying the science isn't going to help those nurses</p>

        <p>That was the whole point of the post? To start out as if I was on your side. It's a little telling that I've seen your point 3 times now. </p>
<p>Tho if I had to pick a side I'd still go with the one that, you know, uses scientific methodology and had evidence for it's claims. And so far, that really hasn't been your side</p>

        <p>So you make the argument for your side by.. supporting our argument? I really don't understand what that seeks to accomplish.</p>
<p>You say that as if there isn't science on both sides, and evidence on both sides. If it was such a simple matter and there was a total consensus on the issues, every country and every person would be doing the exact same thing right now.</p>
<p>But if I had to pick a side, I'd pick the side of basic logic, freedom, and person responsibility. Such as, if you're so terrified and paranoid of this virus, stay home. It's easier than ever to do so. And that governments shouldn't be implementing terribly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns. The "cure" is easily worse than the virus itself at this point. So protect the vulnerable, and take any and all personal precautions mecessary for you to feel safe. Live your life, I'll live mine. Win-win.</p>

        <p>Please do show me the science for your side, I will gladly read through any articles and research you show me, because I myself haven't found anything convincing, tho that might just be me.</p>
<p>What is that "basic logic" you speak of? I get the freedom and personal responsibility thing, but don't you think that when exercising your freedom possibly puts other people in danger you should maybe be a little more considerate? </p>
<p>Lastly, I fully agree that governments have used this to seize too much power, however, again, putting other people in danger isn't the way to protest that. 
What exactly do you mean by "terribly harmful" restrictions and lockdowns? I get that it's very inconvenient, and especially the first one was poorly though out and rushed, but I see no "terrible harm"</p>

        <p>&rt;Please do show me the science for your side</p>
<p>Are you unaware that mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns tank the economy and cause massive spikes in unemployment, poverty, home loss, starvation, missed health checks, obesity, terrible education, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide, amongst a myriad of other terrible things? Not to mention the violation of basic human freedoms, rights, and liberties. Things that harm and kill countless people, and specifically harm and kill the Average Joe far more than this virus with a stupidly high survival rate that primarily harms the very old and/or very vulnerable.</p>
<p>Or that all of said mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns have been largely ineffective? Particularly the mask mandates, when you consider how the vast majority of people wear their mask improperly, touch it incessantly, store it improperly, and/or don't wear a quality that's truly effective - rendering it nearly useless. Yet with that dirty old piece of cloth over their face, they're treated as a saint by society, even if it's doing more harm than good. Meanwhile, anyone who doesn't live behind a mask 24/7 is seen as a terrible, selfish grandma killer.</p>
<p>&rt;don't you think that when exercising your freedom possibly puts other people in danger</p>
<p>I hope you never drive a car or have always worn a mask prior to this last year. If I'm out at a bar without a mask and encounter someone else, regardless if they have a mask and are socially distancing, I'm guessing that they aren't all the concerned about this terrible and deadly virus. Again, protect the vulnerable and protect yourself. If you're afraid, feel free to stay inside and let others live their lives.</p>
<p>&rt;What exactly do you mean by "terribly harmful" restrictions and lockdowns?</p>
<p>See above. It's slightly more than "very inconvenient" for countless people, especially when you consider that people can easily just "Stay home, stay safe."</p>

        <p>Of course your mental health is important, no one is arguing against that!
But if forcing people to do something temporary to protect the many vulnerable, then I think the morality of it is more justifiable.</p>

        <p>Why do you continue making assumptions about me? I did care about the vulnerable, as someone with an immunocompromised family member, and close friend, I've been taking it rather seriously even before 2020. 
Frankly I don't much care for what my or your government has told us, but I do care about what science has shown to be effective in reducing spread. The fact that governments have used that for their convenience is a problem we should definitely solve, but I say we do that after we've reduced the possibility of innocent people being hurt along the way.</p>

        <p>Most, virtually all, of your basic rights have been taken away, you have minimal freedom and liberty, and with policies that have been proposed on the immediate horizon this is just the start. And this won't be the end of it; the authorities will find more excuses in the future to further restrict and monitor you. The whole Covid pandemic, while I have no doubt that there is a real virus, has been entirely engineered to justify this. </p>
<p>It is likely from now on, even though this has never been deemed necessary previously, suddenly we will find ourselves continually thrust into one virus panic after another, with the population now having been trained to accept this, and the authorities will advocate ever more invasive measures in order to respond to this. None of this would have been remotely justifiable, and no-one would have accepted it under normal circumstances, but the whole over-inflated Covid drama has made it possible.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about you, I don't know how old you are, you may be completely unaware of what I'm talking about, but, unfortunately, the society that we live in is deeply compromised, and the population is broadly manipulated by a tiny elite. Most people posting here, not all but most, realise this, and those that don't can see that the Covid restrictions just don't make sense.</p>
<p>It may seem very sad to encounter all of things that you've seen on the news, and heard being repeated continually by the mass media over and over again. But if you take a step back, turn off the TV, and use your own powers of reason and observation in absentia of this conditioning and propaganda, you will realise that what has happened with the lockdown, the masks, the vaccines, and the pandemic is unjustified, completely irrational, and is detrimental to the overwhelming majority of the population.</p>

<p>I'm pointing it out because your instincts are demonstrably wrong in a way that could kill someone <em>literally</em>. (You should actually delete your comment about killing lobster before you cook it. That's dangerous.)</p>

<p>What does that mean? "When science supports what is understood by the common man"? My common sense says to just catch the virus, be sick for a few days and move on with your life. Actually, my common sense tells me you've probably already had it and all this nonsense is nonsense</p>
<p>&rt;I'm willing to call that common sense and go with it.</p>
<p>It's been proven that you're bad with "common sense".</p>
<p>&rt;Until the scientific consensus changes, I'll go with our most up to date understandings</p>
<p>The scientific consensus is what? That keeping kids out of school and maintaining a ridiculous population on unemployment, locked up in their homes and not seeing family is better than possibly spreading a virus that Science says, by their own data, should have already had it and you need a test to know you're "sick"? Come on.</p>

        <p>That would be great. Any actual scientific backup for your claims would be appreciated. Right now it seems like unsubstantiated whining and confusion.</p>

        <p>People may, can and are manipulated much more readily than you might want to admit. What sets those whom are less susceptible to manipulated apart, are the inner question(s) we ask ourselves; This doesn't make sense, this doesn't feel right; Why?. In doing so we seek different and other paths' to enlightenment (information), which leads to alternative narratives, leading one to further research the topic at hand, thus garnering one a higher understanding of said topic.<br>
An example of this may be seen elsewhere in the western sphere. Within the past 5 or so years, vast amounts of people have come to the sudden realisation that there are 1000+ genders. Common sense speaks for itself here, but some people have been truly deeply manipulated in to actually believing every aspect of the 1000+ gender narrative without seeking ones own comprehension, without questioning; Why?</p>
