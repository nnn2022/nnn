<title>“So there is a degree of risk. As with everything in life. We all face risk every day, to varying degrees. That is not at issue. What is at issue is who gets to decide which risks – and to what degree – are acceptable.” Eric Peters’ “It Began With Saaaaaaaaaaaafety Seats“</title>

<p>“According to the logic of the Safety Cult – full-size trucks ought to be mandatory, too. It is no less arbitrarily hysterical – or tyrannical – an idea than forcing child safety seats on all. Or forcing hundreds of millions of healthy people to wear a Face Diaper on the <em>assertion of risk</em> to a handful of <em>hypothetical</em> old and sick people (“granny” being abstract as well as her putative death a <em>potential</em>.)</p>
<p>The core tenet of the Safety Cult is that risk of any kind – as defined by them – is unacceptable and must be ameliorated, regardless of the imposition or the expense on <em>us</em>.”</p></p>
