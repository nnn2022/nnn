    <strong>Anyone know of any protests coming up in Glasgow?</strong>
    <p><p>So my country just enforced another March level lockdown. My education is ruined, I'm probably going to fail multiple subjects this year and if this doesn't end soon I'll probably just kill myself. I don't want to go down without a fight, if anything.</p></p>

        <p>To despair is to sin, friend. Hope is the most wonderful light you can have in these times when everything seems so dark. Just know that the times we are living in are so unnatural, and whether we humans know it or not, everything will return to it's natural state. This is a part of that transition, and it's hard, but it will ultimately be a wonderful and good thing. Please do not take your own life, as the only thing that is certain in our short time on this Earth is that we will die. Why bring that certainty before you know what might change? Keep the Truth like a fire in your heart, and may nothing shake you.</p>

        <p>Thank you. Deep down I know it will end, like it has ended so many times in so many disguises in history. It's just the uncertainty on <em>when</em>. Do I have enough hope to hold out till then? And worst of all, the feeling of utter helplessness over my own life.</p>

        <p>Everything within you was made to face uncertainty. Your ancestors survived ice ages, famines, wars. Everything that has occurred to your ancestors up to right now has made you who you are. Don't forget that. You are the product of the strongest of their times. I recommend reading Tolkien for some inspiration if that interests you. There is a theme that stands out among the rest in the LOTR trilogy: Hope. 
Please do not give up. Know that there is no way we can fail!!! Truth always prevails, whether it takes 5 years or 50. Know that in your heart.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your kind and true words. You have lifted my despair a little ways, and I cannot express my gratitude. I will try to spread that positivity to help others the same way you helped me!</p>

        <p>It feels and looks dark and gloom at the moment for many of us. But from your message it is clear you are a fighter. So don't give up. There is nothing or almost nothing in life that cannot be adjusted, adapted or dealt with. Try to deal with one thing at a time in small steps. And just keep working on whatever is important or crucial in your life at the moment. If it is studies, give it priority and don't despair. Small steps and one thing at a time to start with.</p>
