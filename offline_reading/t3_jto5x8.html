        <p>Seemingly there is no flu this year.
I don’t take unnecessary shots.</p>
<p>I also think the flu vaccine is just a way for big pharma to make money. I don’t think it does anything. Glorified placebo</p>

        <p>I don’t ever get one. Not because I have anything against it, but I just don’t care enough about the flu to go and get the shot. I don’t ever even think about it.</p>
<p>Edit: I won’t be getting it this year either. Still don’t care about the flu</p>

        <p>I got one (not the shot but the nasal thing) in college since it was free and got sick a couple weeks later. Since then I never bothered again. I'm not anti-vax in general but only believe in vaccination when the risk of not doing so outweighs the risk of potential side-effects. e.g. if I were often around the elderly I'd probably get a flu shot even though the success rate of it is not generally very high from year to year.</p>

        <p>I haven't gotten a flu shot since '07 or '08. Rarely get sick and I would get the flu when I had the shot anyways so what is the point. Don't plan on getting it this year either.</p>
<p>Probably won't get the new vaccine either if I don't have to but probably won't have a choice.</p>

<p>I used to get bad colds many times a year but for the past 5 years since I stopped eating fast food and looking after my sleep I haven't been sick once.</p>

        <p>The one time I got the shot, I got flu.  I used to get flu every year. I’m not bothering.  But I did notice the language does the shots has changed to get a shot for you, get a shot to protect those around you! WTAF?!?! Hell to the NO!</p>

        <p>I get the flu shot every year and get the flu nearly every year. I was going to get mine this year anyway just by default but all their constant bothering about it (I’ve been called by 3 pharmacies and 2 of my doctors offices “reminding me to get one because it’s extra important this year”) has made me not want to. Tell me to do something and I want to do it even less, I’m stubborn like that. Not that it’s ever seemed to help me anyway</p>

        <p>Honestly I just didn’t really care. The vaccine can be effective if they include the correct strains, the problem is that more often than not they miss what strains are the major issue that year and the shot is almost completely ineffective. I never minded getting it in the hopes that maybe they’d get it right and I’d avoid it. I have respiratory issues and the flu has hospitalized me a few times and I always felt I needed to do what I could to avoid it. Funnily enough I also had covid and it was nothing compared to the flu for me, was a tiny little cold.  </p>
<p>From my POV getting the flu shot doesn’t hurt, unlike the covid vaccine that will come out, which I do not trust as it has been rushed and may cause a number of serious effects down the line we don’t know about. However with the flu being gone this year (/s) and their constant whining at me to get the vaccine, I won’t be getting one and hey if I don’t get the flu this year maybe I won’t get one going forward.</p>

        <p>Nope, I've never gotten a flu shot and haven't gotten the flu since childhood (I'm 34 now). I've learned to treat my body well from dealing with some chronic issued that I've mostly been able to recover from, and that has been what brought me, well before COVID, to a deep distrust of the medical system. The medical system isn't all bad, for sure it can do some very helpful things in the right situations, but the level of manipulation by big pharma for their own profits is staggering. The issue I see is the profound arrogance of so much of the medical system towards control of people's behavior. If medical practitioners were considered more like any other people that are hired for their expertise and services, we wouldn't be in this mess.</p>
<p>A study a few years ago showed that getting the flu shot increased the risk of coronavirus infection by 36% <a href="https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/04/no_author/new-study-the-flu-vaccine-is-significantly-associated-with-an-increased-risk-of-coronavirus/">https://www.lewrockwell.com/2020/04/no_author/new-study-the-flu-vaccine-is-significantly-associated-with-an-increased-risk-of-coronavirus/</a> This was before COVID but it stands to reason it could apply to COVID as well, so that's yet another reason not to get the flu shot this year.</p>

        <p>I used to not get the flu shot but I got one when I was pregnant and I've been getting it ever since. My toddler also gets one. I am more scared of my toddler getting the flu than I am of her getting COVID, if you can believe that. I highly doubt that we will ever get this COVID vaccine (assuming we make it through this dark winter everyone is talking about!)</p>

        <p>I’ve only had the flu shot a couple of times in my life. I didn’t bother last year, but this year I might. My SIL is having a baby in the next couple of weeks and I know that babies can be particularly vulnerable to the flu.</p>
