    <strong>Guys... I'm having a really hard time dealing with recent developments</strong>
    <p><p>First off... I feel incredibly weak because I'm a middle-aged dad that should just be powering through this but I'm really at the end of my rope and I feel like I'm about to have a mental breakdown. With the election over it's likely we will have some kind of new wave of restrictions wash over most of the country after nearly a year of really struggling with work and trying to deal with kids being at home while not being able to see friends or family. </p>
<p>I recently talked to my parents and their state is going into a new wave of harsh restrictions and despite having covid and having gotten over it they are even more terrified now and continue to isolate and sanitize the entire house because my mom read that you can get it a 2nd time. </p>
<p>All holiday plans are canceled, Christmas and Thanksgiving. They have banned my sister from seeing them because she is leading a largely normal life and refuses to be alone. My sister lives in a single bedroom studio by herself and not going outside would basically make her a hermit. </p>
<p>I also had a friend tell me this morning that if it weren't for me calling her constantly to check on her she likely would have killed herself this year because all of her other friends have abandoned any kind of social interaction. </p>
<p>A new round of covid restrictions will also mean that I will likely be out of work in 2021 with no prospects for getting another job in my area. I barely hung on to my job this year as is... we can survive on my wife's income but it will be an extremely frugal life. </p>
<p>How are y'all dealing with this. I'm looking out at next year and seeing no end to this and I'm just losing hope.</p></p>

        <p>I normally do Thanksgiving with my wife's family. They've become so paranoid they want to do a "zoom-giving" (their exact term). So we said fuck it and we're going to have a big gathering at our house with friends. My point is keep close the friends and family who want to see you more than they fear the virus. Stop watching the news if you are. It's designed to put you in a state of anxiety. This will end one way or the other, but it could get worse before it gets better.</p>

        <p>Same here, I'm in California and most of my family is in the midwest so covid or not it's just me and my boyfriend and a few friends this year,but even if I was back home there's no way I would do a "zoomgiving" thankfully most of my family isn't paranoid about covid so that ain't happening</p>

        <p>The only other instances come from China at the beginning of the pandemic, when they sucked at testing and had a lot of false positives. Then when people actually got it, it looked like they were “reinfected”.</p>
<p>The fact that people don’t talk about China more is astounding. So much of the panic came from China putting out propaganda videos.</p>

        <p>There are different strains. It's possible to get infected by two different strains. Just because you have immunity to one doesn't necessarily mean you have immunity to all after infection. </p>
<p>HOWEVER - just because you can get it twice doesn't mean the second time is nearly as dangerous. Once you have some level of immune response from a first infection that second infection won't be nearly as serious - worst case it'll be flu-like symptoms and that's it. The whole reason this virus is different (and more dangerous) than the flu is because we don't have any real pre-existing immune response to it, so the first time it hits you it can wreak havoc. But once you have that immune response you're fine.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately your kind words of hope and encourage is not gonna stop someone from having a mental breakdown. </p>
<p>The reality of this lockdown is that, for some, it has been a real inconvenience that has significantly reduced our quality of life. For others it goes deeper than that. I think an important aspect of this sub is to show the raw reality of lockdown, how it is literally causing people to lose their minds. I am one of them and I am at my wits end. I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel currently and have relapsed into my bad habits and addictions. </p>
<p>OP— continue reaching out to that friend, surround yourself with people who don’t buy into this garbage lockdown, seek support to help yourself. It’s stories like yours that should remind people what governments have done to their people. They’ve ruined the lives of many in their gross abuse of power. They should be held accountable in a serious way.</p>

        <p>Kinda sad, but at this point I see this thing going full-circle. What I mean by that is, I see the c0vid fear continuing to ramp up and become more accepted until our entire lives revolve around it. Then, anti-c0vid opinion will become fringe. However, what becomes fringe eventually becomes counterculture, and counterculture is "cool." When it's counterculture, you'll see the types who are virtue-signalling doomers turn into counterculture, because there's a certain chunk of the population that always jumps on bandwagons to feel accepted by others. Once that happens, the counterculture will have enough support and it will turn into a revolution. Only then will we be free.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I'm explaining this as I would like to, but to me I don't really see another path right now aside from a massive war or civil war shaking up society so much that people will forget about c0vid because they're too busy trying to survive the apocalypse.</p>

<p>Yeah, 10 years ago when I was a fringey leftist, all my more conformist family and friends told me I was crazy and too extreme. (I was, but that is not the point of this story). I've since realized the error of my ways, but the bizarre thing is <em>every single one of them</em> believes now a lot of what I believed then. What was fringe then is mainstream now. That gives me hope that it can happen that way again.</p>

        <p>I'm not alone, then! Exactly the same thing has happened to me. I look around and am amazed that what I sincerely believed about ten years ago I now reject and everyone else is now preaching (albeit in a somewhat perverted and exaggerated form).</p>
<p>Does this mean that people like you and me will be in favour of lockdowns and mandatory masks in x years' time? Somehow I don't think so, but I hope it works the other way as you suggest.</p>

        <p>If Trump manages to hold on to power after losing the popular vote by over 5 million and the electoral college by 3 states it'll be the end of democracy. </p>

        <p>DO NOT BE ASHAMED TO COLLECT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.</p>
<p>First, you earned unemployment payments by earning wages, which were (of course) invisibly docked to pay for the unemployment insurance the entire time you worked.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is only one group of Americans that is too proud to accept "benefits" and that is why that group of Americans happens to be struggling really hard right now. I'll leave the exact nature of this group to your imagination, but I think you'll catch my drift.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where you live, but I’d suggest you stop following the rules. It’s really that simple. Invite your sister, any of her friends, and your friend and anyone she can grab to tag along and have Thanksgiving.  Start talking to the parents of your kids’ friends.  I can’t believe not a single one of them would forbid their kids to be around yours. Get your kids out of the house, let them spend the night or have friends spend the night at your place.</p>
<p>Same with Christmas.  Have some friends over, have a drop in for any and all who will come. </p>

        <p>My immediate family members have thrown the holidays out too. I have really been focusing on feeling grateful I have my kiddo and husband. Even though sometimes ...I just want to get away from my kiddo and husband. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The other night I was roughhousing with my kid and doing Eskimo kisses and smiling, making faces. So many people don't have access to that and its worth so much. Take a nature walk if you can and think about whats waiting for you at home, the good is worth all the bad of it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We will be ok. Were parents. We can handle juuuuust about anything.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If they come for my kids happiness any more than they already have though, Im suiting up for war. </p>

        <p>Why are holidays canceled? </p>
<p>It’s sad that you can’t do them with your parents, but it is important (most especially for your kids!) that you still do them. Call your friend, and your sister, and every sane person you know and arrange your own celebration. </p>
<p>Go all out, make this Thanksgiving the best one ever. What do you have to be thankful for? </p>
<p>The fact that you’re a free human who doesn’t require permission or approval from <em>anyone</em> to live your life, and that you’re teaching those lucky kids of yours to do the same.</p>

        <p>How old/young the kids?  I know its getting cold but find playgrounds in your area and get your kids out to run around.  I'm in the boonies and have a few very packed parks.  No masks any where.  I'm on my 4th cold this year and still alive.</p>
<p>I'm fearing the real cold when parks just wont do it particularly since I refuse to mask up.</p>

        <p>As I read your post, nearly every single detail made me think, "Did I write this?"</p>
<p>Please know you are not alone. I know it doesn't help, directly, but... It may actually be a quiet majority of people who feel as we do. We have been silenced and oppressed. Shut down. Our lives and livelihoods stolen from us. Forced to work more and harder, for less.</p>
<p>I don't know what we can do about it yet, but we have people relying on us, so we have to stick through it. But it's hard, yeah.</p>
<p>When you think about it --- they have taken so much from us, all while calling it a "mild inconvenience" and calling us "selfish" if we don't want to comply...</p>
<p>What else will they take? How far will they go?</p>
<p>We must fight this thing somehow, but first we must take care of those who rely on us.</p>
<p>Hang in there. You must. We must.</p>
<p>At some point, the tide will turn. People will wake up. Surely.</p>

        <p>I’m going a bit crazy from it all, too. My county in California just went into one of Newsom’s special alert color tiers, so they will probably but shutting and/restricting a lot of things soon, here. I have to wear a mask at work, gloves when touching customers’ cars, and sanitize them &amp; our courtesy vehicles when they come back. I am doing the jobs of 3 people (up from 2 pre-covid since my company is cheap), and I’m making the same close-to-minimum-wage shit wages. I can’t take my job anymore, they keep passing me up for promotion, and adding more shit for me to do. </p>
<p>Thankfully my family near me is pretty lax with all this covid fear, so I see my mom, sister, and grandparents often. My dad and sister in Arizona are over it too, so I see them as well. I have been dumped by almost all my friends long before covid, so no difference there.  But I can’t say I’m feeling very hopeful.</p>

        <p>Reminder that you are NOT weak. We are being asked to go against our human nature. We NEED socialization. I’d turn off all news and limit interaction with doomers. Celebrate with your sister and friends if you want to. We don’t deserve to live like this, nobody does. But we do have some control. You don’t need permission to enjoy your life as best you can. I’m sorry about your job and mental health, I really don’t know what to say about that. But this community is always here for you if you need it.</p>

        <p>Don't feel weak.  We are living in a dystopia right now.  We're working but basically unable to do anything fun that isn't outdoor exercise.  </p>
<p>Personally, I have a lot of good friends and I'm doing a ton of hiking/camping/backpacking, but even so I'm starting to burn out on my hiking hobby because it's really my only option for fun.  The thought that things might get <em>worse</em> again is intolerable to me.  I basically grew up in an extremely religious, authoritarian household where I was not allowed to have my own thoughts/opinions about anything, and was forced to be my mother's constant companion and caretaker as her health declined.  By the time I got out of the house, I'd graduated into the 2008 recession and my husband and I struggled with employment and money from day 1 of our marriage.  We were poor and stressed out and (in my case) severely overworked for 8 years.  Things turned around drastically in 2016 when I got my dream job which paid well <em>and</em> had a work-life balance.  I was finally thriving instead of just surviving.  I was able to get a diagnosis and treatment for my autoimmune disease.  I was healthy, and able to spend money on fun things that I chose for the first time in my life.</p>
<p>I got 4 good years and then 2020 hit.  I get a lot of people acting like I'm exaggerating about how unhappy I am living with the CA restrictions.  They don't understand.  They got to be real teenagers, and partied in college, and traveled as young adults.  Of course you don't mind a year of Suck when you got to live your whole life normal and happy.  For me, I have literally only been happy (other than young childhood) from 2016-2020.  This was supposed to be the beginning, and now they're taking this year from me and threatening to take next year too.  A year might not seem like much but when you've only had 4 happy years it's a lot to lose.</p>

        <p>I understand, and you're not alone. Don't obey. Don't comply. Do as many normal things as you're able in your area. My states locking back down, so is my parents most likely (NM and NV respectively) Luckily my parents aren't scared, but we've seen each other this whole time. No one else can help take care of them, I'll be damned if the government tells me I can't travel freely and see my family, friends, go outside, etc. There has to be a way we can find local skeptics to connect with.</p>

        <p>My suggestion would be, fuck the people that cancelled everything. Invite your sister, your friend and any other 'normal' people you have in your life over for Thanksgiving / Christmas. Let the rest of them do as they want, but don't let their madness infect you. I'm under lockdown in the UK but over the last 8 months I've made new friends (and kept a few old ones) who are against this new normal too.  Most of them are coming round for a normal dinner and drinks tomorrow.  In lockdown. This is what is helping to keep me sane, without that I'd be where you are. You've just gotta let the crazies do their thing and get on with living your life.  That is the only way you are going to get through this because it isn't going away, much as we might want it to.</p>

        <p>I know it would be incredibly difficult to pack up and move but it may be your only option at this point. South Dakota or Florida. There would be more work there and less restrictions. Not sure if there's opportunities for your wife there as well or if these states are even financially feasible for you to afford, but it is worth considering. What other options do you have really? A big change might be exactly what you need.</p>

        <p>I personally do not agree with the tone of this sub because I'm networked in the medical community, but I do sympathize with anyone struggling to find work. If you're really desperate here is a list of remote job opportunities across the country updated regularly and expirations removed, hope you find something and your situation becomes less severe, unfortunately this is where we are now due to neglect of critical disease fighting institutions.<br>

        <p>Haha at thinking the medical community don't agree with us, most of the doctors and nurses I've met think it's BS as well. At the last protest I went to there were 4 nurses in scrubs next to me.</p>
