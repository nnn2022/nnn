    <strong>How long do you think the public will tolerate this "new normal" bs?</strong>
    <p><p>" We as a people are far too willing to give up freedoms for the illusion of safety" George Carlin.</p>
<p>I think this quote is incredibly apt currently. The media has been more about fear than facts during this whole pandemic nonsense. When in reality it's mostly killing the elderly and immune compromised. Something along 98% of people who've gotten it have recovered. Yet the government is treating it as if it was the black death. Yeah now things are starting to open up but it's far from business as usual.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Who is really going to go to a five start restaurant where plastic is separating every table, where you most order and pay via the places app and are served by a waiter in a face mask and rubber gloves?</p>
<p>Education is going down hill as well the government isn't going to fit the bill for everyone to have access to a tablet or laptop. ( and in the US 25% of americans still don't have access to the internet)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There's so much rage in the air right now with lock downs,people losing their jobs over said lock downs and of course the death of mr floyd. Do you think once the mr floyd stuff simmers down we as a people will make our voices be heard on how this "new normal" simply cannot work?</p></p>

        <p>So ive posted on a couple of different subs and its mostly out of frustration.  I'm an artist and after years of hard work and holding down a normal job, I was finally about to have a groundbreaking year.  With published books, a big convention twice a month all culminating with a hard earned spot at SDCC.  I understood when the first few of the year were postponed.  But then those got canceled. And now a convention,  in Florida,  for October just canceled until next year because overwhelming fan outrage about it attempting to happen.  So im just feeling what's the point.  I live in Houston and Ikea was jam packed earlier.  Yet every artist and vendor or trade show employee is financially ruined.  Because it seems a whole lot of people DO want this to be the new normal.  No concerts or anything either? No museums? A life devoid of anything but grocery shopping and watching the same movies over and over on Netflix ? No thanks</p>

        <p>SDCC as is san diego comic con? If so, thats very impressive. I'm very sorry to hear this bs has had a impact on you. Yeah is this the death of concerts and cinema because people are sheep and eat up what the media is feeding them? It's a scary thought that I might never see a movie at the cinema again...</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry and completely feel your pain on this. I'm an avant-garde performance artist and had cancellations as well (a show I was prepping for 7 months which can never happen now, because it was anti-NHS, and now everyone claps on the streets for the NHS... it's the most pathetic, skin-crawling thing ever).   </p>
<p>Sadly though... in my 20+ years experience... this is just a gigantic leap in the trajectory we were already marching towards. I have often thought, "when the Boomers are too old or dead, I will have no fan base left." (And I'm a Millennial).</p>

        <p>I think people are getting fed up already. I went shopping today at an outdoor outlet mall and almost no customers were wearing masks, just the staff. There was a group of about 12 teenagers in line in front of me who didn't social distance at all and wore no masks. They were typical teenagers, in each other's faces and looking at each other's phones, etc.</p>
<p>I think more and more people will reject the new normal but are afraid right now to speak up. It will take a few brave people to speak out to start the ball rolling. My husband and I picked up dinner from a nice restaurant tonight and the server was so proper and formal but the minute I asked when he thinks the lockdown will be over, and indicated that I thought it was ridiculous that we can't even have patios open, he opened right up about how dumb this all is and how mad they all are, and how our city has seen almost no deaths but we have to be locked down because Toronto has sick people. It was like a flood gate opened. I think this will be the case more and more. We just have to start speaking up, but it's so hard because in some cases people's jobs and businesses are at stake if they do.</p>

        <p>Yeah im curious how long this can realistically be enforced until people start getting fed up Im already seeing it here. Was at target today and they force people 6 feet apart in line and won't allow more than one customers items on the belt. Which makes a line of 6 people almost reach half way down the fucking main aisle. Imagine how bad black friday would be if this is still going on. People will simply start shopping online more and more,</p>

        <p>It's so ridiculous. Here, all stores have to wipe down their counters with sanitizer before allowing the next customer to put their items on it. This is the provincial law. So that means the grocery store cashier wipes down the entirety of the conveyer belt between customers, so we can't start loading even when the other customer is paying and leaving.</p>
<p>Like you said, lineups are so long - they just get in the way of all of the other shoppers. </p>
<p>Today my cashier just said "do you care?" regarding wiping the counter down, and I said no, so she skipped it and put my order through and that was that. It was great.</p>

        <p>The wiping down after each person is silly and "safety theater"---like think how impossible it would be for anything to transfer from your hand to the box of chex mix, to the conveyor belt, to the next guy's bag of Doritos, to his hand to then potentially infect him. Like the chance of that working out perfectly is the tiniest tiniest percentage above 0 that it's statistically meaningless. </p>

        <p>Speaking of the environment...</p>
<p>Last weekend, my wife and I went out to eat for the first time since this charade began. I was glad to finally sit down in a restaurant, but they were using all disposable items: cups, utensils, takeout containers instead of plates. I was confused by this because aren't restaurant dishwashers required to sanitize as well? But the kicker was that all the disposable items were <em>styrofoam</em>! I was appalled.</p>
<p>BTW, went to a different place yesterday and they were using regular plates, so now I'm thoroughly confused.</p>

        <p>I really want to believe people will reject it, but then I see others seemingly okay with living like this. For instance, I hate wearing masks, and tend to not wear mine outdoors. Meanwhile, 95% of people around me are wearing them, and seem perfectly fine with the masks lately. </p>
<p>My mother has said she's fine living like this because she feels "safer" now (she has been pro-lockdown from the get-go). I see people online claim they love this new lifestyle, and don't want it to end, citing that it could be the start of a new utopia. It's so fucked up, and while there are people who hate the "New Normal", it feels like it's just not nearly enough to make any sort of splash in terms to reverting back to the way things used to be.</p>

        <p>I notice a lot of the elderly are pro lock down likely because the virus is mostly killing older folks. People belittle me often in public for not wearing a mask. I have a foot long beard so it kinda makes masks redundant for me. I like to think there's more anti new normal than pro normal. The media just won't cover it because clearly there's some agendas at play here.</p>
<p>I live in a tourist trap. I just don't think realistically tourists will tolerate all this new normal crap. Hopefully when profits in various businesses take a hit they will start rejecting all this new normal crap.</p>

        <p>Only if it fits an agenda, and since the media has labeled anti-lockdown as a Right Wing movement, we'll have a harder time getting our rights back if at all. It's disingenuous of them to lump all of us under that political umbrella, but they don't care. It's all agenda.</p>

        <p>Definitely!! I’m actually very liberal and voted for Sanders. I think Trump and Biden both suck (no offense if you like either of them, I don’t have a problem with people with different political views unlike many on my side unfortunately do) and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been labeled a right wing Trump supporter and conspiracy theorist for even pointing out negative aspects of the lockdown. This world has collectively lost its mind. It’s getting harder to make friends because I feel like so few people think like I do.</p>

I'd like to offer a counterpoint! Now could be a wonderful time to make friends. Non-maskies going about their business, I say hey. Opportunities to find folks who think the same and who knows!
I reconnected with someone who is anti-lockdown, and we defo haven't been meeting up to have fun 👌</p>

<p>I flew out of state to see a friend at the beginning of May and didn’t tell anyone for fear of being judged. It was fine. I went for a hike and didn’t get covid. Shortest security lines I’ve ever seen at an airport, it was awesome</p>

        <p>It really depends what area your in. In red states people have mostly given up on social distancing. In blue states its starting to happen more and more. And also the Bay Area is reopening outdoor dining with no plexiglass which is pretty good. Inside, there's still a lot of plastic around in the resternaut sadly</p>

Some people I know that have been kind of skeptical from the beginning are starting to fall in line with the new rules because they don't want to look like a Trump supporter when they're out in public</p>

        <p>&rt;Who is really going to go to a five start restaurant where plastic is separating every table, where you most order and pay via the places app and are served by a waiter in a face mask and rubber gloves?</p>
<p>That seems so dystopian.</p>
<p>But what's even worse than that? Plastic bubbles separating diners sitting at the <strong>same</strong> table. Who wants to eat out with their friends/family only to be separated by plastic bubbles once seated? Beyond ridiculous pure security theatre.</p>

        <p>They’ll definitely be some resistance for a while on social media and it’ll validate for many reasons to not take part in it with family. If people can protest I see no reason why we can’t sit and enjoy a turkey.  No social distancing in the home BS. Just a good American thanksgiving. Also i reckon 4th of July would also be a big turning point but I usually forget that one as I’m British</p>

        <p>Yeah the protests going on right now is the start of returning to old school normal i think. Yeah a few people will catch the virus but im doubting this "second wave" the media is on about will not come to pass.</p>

<p>They've canceled all the 4th of July parades/festivals in my area. There have been talks of local groups creating "protest parade marches" because that is allowable. These would just happen to have tractors and floats, and all the usual midwestern parade stuff.</p>

<p>(Note: I'm totally for the protests going on right now, I just hate the double standard of what's allowed and what isn't)</p>

<p>Meh. People said Memorial Day would be a "big turning point" as well. Hell, people even said Easter would be it. Nothing's <em>really</em> changed due to holidays.</p>

        <p>They've been showing they're done for the past week. I truly believe it was many protests under 1 umbrella. If we let another lockdown happen and abide by "the rules", I'd be surprised. But even more surprised if our local elected officials even attempted another push at any of it. But I think they'll fail miserably if they do actually try.</p>

        <p>I’m concerned it will last longer than we think. It’s making me reflect if a lot of my acquaintances, who live in the suburbs, with toddler-aged kids, particularly are just like “oh well, I’ll suck up it up”. They tend to be homebodies anyway, and barely travelled out of their home state even for vacations. I’m wondering how many people have lives devoid of excitement and novelty-seeking to begin with so they are better at sticking it out. Worried that the white collar population, with their suburban homes and yards and lack of activities to begin with will still be fine with this BS.</p>

        <p>A vast majority of them so long as they feel it's in their best interest. They will tolerate it and embrace it. "It's for your security" "It's for the public good. This isn't about you, this is about your neighbors, your friends, your family"  </p>
<p>Lets look at what happened back during the Snowden Revelations.  </p>
<p>Everything the government was doing (and us little conspiracy lovers were accusing them of doing) came to light. There were public outrages, people boycotting facebook and google and everything, people were marching in protests. People were outraged.  </p>
<p>But then Google comes out and says "WE CAN AUTOMATE YOUR LIFE AND MAKE IT SO MUCH EASIER LOOK! LOOK!! LOOK!!" Amazon comes out and says "Hey we have that too meet your new friend Alexa" and people went "wow this is amazing, I can have my whole house automated talk to me, connect everything together.   </p>
<p>People will always trade their freedoms in terms of security and comforts/luxurys.  Anyone who speaks out against it. You're deemed a social discourse. You don't care about your friends. You're selfish. Think of the children. And now it eventually becomes you're somewhere on a list watched or deemed "a potential" threat.  </p>
<p>Linking this back to Snowden: You say, I want to take back my privacy I'm going to check out Tails Linux, and boom congrats the system just scooped you up place you in a long list of people to monitor more closely. Simply for curiosity and simply for wanting to exercise your right to private thoughts and free speech.   </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong here: I absolutely find it disgusting this is the case. But I'm just being real about it. We'll be in the same subculture as "punks" were in the 80s/90s. The outcasts, the black sheep.</p>

        <p>I am one that has benefitted economically from the lockdowns.  I got a raise and I work from home dropping an awful horrible commute.  However, I agree the lockdowns were and continue to me the largest mistake possibly ever made in this country.  Its not that we over estimated the possible risk of death.  Its that we greatly underestimated all the side effects in aggregate.</p>
