        <p>Yes, let’s completely change our lives and the world and decimate entire industries over something with a 99.8% survival rate.  Not only that, but the majority of the population actually has about a 99.993% survival rate, but rather than protecting the at risk while allowing everyone else to keep the economy going, we will instead insist that everyone does exactly the same thing, regardless of risk</p>

        <p>The overwhelming majority of people getting sick are elderly people who aren’t working.  Under 50 your chances of dying of Covid are lower than your chances of dying on a car ride to work, and more people under 50 died in car accidents this year than of Covid.</p>
<p>On Sweden - a certain part of their economy is going to be driven by external factors, but even with that, they did significantly better than the average in the EY.  They saw a 8.6% decline in GDP for Q2, as a point of comparison Spain had 18.5%, France 13.8%, Italy 12.4% etc.</p>

        <p>There was still a lot more deaths in Sweden compared to other scandinavian countries like Finland (374) and Norway (305), while Swedens death toll is at 6406. These deaths could have been avoided.
And scandinavian countries have socialized healthcare and good safety nets, so the lockdown didnt hit the individual as hard as in the US.</p>

        <p>You’re only looking at one piece of the puzzle.  Because Covid targets the very old and very infirm to such an extent, in many cases “Covid” deaths are deaths that would have happened in 6 months anyway.  That’s typically why it’s not old people in nursing homes who are arguing that we need lockdowns (in fact the opposite is often true) - they know they have very little time left and want to spend that time with their families, Covid or not.</p>
<p>On Sweden - as of 11/13, Sweden had had 79k total deaths for the year.  But - in 2019 they had 89k deaths for the year, 2018 92k, 2017 92k etc.  There is very little evidence that Covid has had any real impact on <em>total</em> mortality in Sweden, in fact they’re heading for a lower total mortality number than they’ve had in several years.  Total mortality is important because it gets rid of a lot of the noise around Covid vs non-Covid (a death is a death, regardless of what it’s from)</p>
<p>Taking Finland &amp; Norway, the same is true, there hasn’t been much change pre and post Covid.  One would expect to see a significant difference in total mortality between Sweden and Norway, compared to their historical averages, and it simple doesn’t exist.  This is a good article that highlights it: https://www.news-medical.net/news/20201116/Study-compares-deaths-in-Sweden-and-Norway-before-and-after-COVID-pandemic.aspx</p>
<p>Everyone wants the same thing here, but there is a legitimate question around the efficacy of lockdowns, given their extraordinary cost and completely unproven benefit, and as a society we should be welcoming that debate</p>

        <p>Now what do you think would have happened if everyone didnt lock down? If everyone acted as if everything was normal? I think that there would be a big spike in infections and deaths, because there arent enough hospital beds or any medical gear. Even medical staff would be lacking, since they can also get sick. People with corona cant work, because otherwise they will infect someone else. </p>
<p>Now i will admit the lockdowns could have been done better. Personally i think we should have taxed big corporations, who profit from the virus, a lot more. They make more money, while the rest of the economy suffers. Big corporations dont need bailouts from the government. That monet could have been used for the people and not just the rich.</p>

We can see from Sweden how minimal the impact of lockdowns has been.  In fact, there is essentially zero evidence that lockdowns have had any real impact after all this time.  If you have evidence of how lockdowns have been effective please provide it, but if you compare areas or countries that locked down with those who didn’t there is functionally no difference</p>

        <p>The reason why Sweden didnt want to lock down, is because they wanted to get herd immunity without a vaccine. Only 7.3% of the population has herd immunity.
Now as i might have said before, lockdowns are meant to put less stress on the hospitals. </p>
<p>Also i asked you a question. What would be the other alternative? You calling my question "intellectually lazy" is just lazy, instead of just answering the question.</p>
<p>Also Sweden still had a voluntary lockdown and a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people.
Now ill admit the lockdowns could have been done better.
Less bailouts for big corporations, only have stay at home orders for people, who can work from home.
And for those who have to be at work physically, practice social distancing, wear a mask, use hand sanitizer. 
Things such as schools can easily be done online and office work can be done from home. </p>
<p>I choose to look at human lives, while you choose to look at economy. An economy can be revived, a dead person can not.
Also if a person gets covid, and is hospitalized, there is a 90% chance that they will have long lasting symptoms.
Now i wonder if there is a way to avoid this, but still get herd immunity. Oh yeah thats right. Vaccines might do the job. And that vaccine is being tested, and should be available this year or the start of next year.</p>

        <p>Sweden never said they were pursuing a “herd immunity strategy”, what they said was that the only purpose of a lockdown is manage hospital resources so that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed.  Beyond that, if there is a vulnerable population you should protect them, but effectively quarantining healthy people has never been an accepted way of fighting an infectious disease.  They also point out that the general principle behind “flatten the curve” is that the same number of people ultimately get the virus, but just over a longer period.</p>
<p>I didn’t say your question was intellectually lazy - what I did say is that to say “just think how had it would have been if we hadn’t locked down” is intellectually lazy.  You can’t prove a negative - if the virus had petered out to nothing everyone would have said “wow, aren’t we glad we locked down, we saved the day”.  With everything not doing great, everyone is saying “well, think how much worse it would have been if we hadn’t locked down”.  It’s a logical fallacy.  In the case of Sweden (our closest to a control group) - they are trending roughly 90% below what we were told would happen if we did nothing. Likewise there is almost no difference between a states that locked down hard vs not at all.  I’m in California, which has had the tightest restrictions, strongest mask mandate, highest compliance rate etc., and we’re about middle of the pack in terms of deaths.  Hardly a glowing endorsement of lockdowns.</p>
<p>The alternative was to do what we have done with LITERALLY EVERY OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASE IN HUMAN HISTORY - manage response based on a given risk group (in this case protect the elderly), provide guidelines within a voluntary system, and allow people to take personal responsibility for their safety.</p>
<p>Couple of other points:
1. Your comment on “90% of people have long lasting symptoms” shows how ignorant you are.  That is a completely made up number, particularly given a huge portion literally never present a single symptom (so kind of hard for them to then have long lasting symptoms)
2. Your comment about valuing life over the economy is self righteous drivel.  Countless lives will be lost due to skyrocketing suicide rates, delayed medical diagnoses etc.  the World Bank estimates ~100m will fall into extreme poverty around the world, with corresponding catastrophic impacts on the lives of those people.</p>

        <p>Im simply just asking, what do you think would have happened if there wasnt a lockdown. What do you think the alternative would be? I personally think the economy would still be shit, and there would be more deaths.
Also i said 90% percent of people who are hospitalized. Hospitalized. Meaning they have to go to the hospital.</p>
<p>Also sid you not read the part, where i said that a vaccine would be done by the end of the year? A vaccine will have a huge impact on the deathcount</p>

        <p>Actually I think none of them should pay taxes, but it is also demonstrably false to say that a reduction in taxes is “giving” people money.  If a thief stole $100 from me and then gave me $10 back I wouldn’t say that thief “gave” me $10, I would say they stole $90 rather than $100.</p>

        <p>I’m truly amazed at how backwards you have this.  Of course I don’t complain about paying rent - because it is a VOLUNTARY TRANSACTION IN A MARKET ENVIRONMENT WITH ALTERNATIVES, PRICE TRANSPARENCY, AND MARKET FORCES.  A government has none of those things.  If taxes are the equivalent to “rent” it is the sort of “rent” you pay to a slum lord has you in debt to that you have to pay off by turning tricks on the street corner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the absolute irony, is that “progressives” argue against actual rent and the concept of landlords, while arguing in favor of ever expanding government to take control of all aspects of your life with no competition, transparency, or alternatives.</p>
<p>For billionaires - I don’t care about them one way or the other.  I don’t care how much money Bezos has, I care about my own situation, while also recognizing how much I benefit from what he has created.</p>

<p>Sorry, but if you think his ideas would have done anything without the services that our society has, you're a fool.</p>
<p>You thinkbezos would have trecked miles on foot through dense forest to deliver a fucking book? Swam across a river because there was no bridge?</p>
<p>Do you think he could have got Amazon from his garage if he didn't have  millions of people in our society who had went to ouclic school, who were born in publicly funded hospitals, who's houses were saved from forest fires by government funded firefighters?</p>
<p>The more you get, the more you owe back to the society that has enabled you.</p>

        <p>There is still little to no evidence. Sure we’d all love to wake up one day and see Trump winning the election. But that isn’t happening unfortunately. Even if we take out the states that were suspicious like Michigan or Georgia. Biden is still winning by a slim margin. So 99% chance he’s president unless some miracle happens.</p>

        <p>I haven’t really been keeping up since election week. But I know some states are doing recounts. I see people saying Biden is down to 227 or so electoral votes but everywhere I see still says 306. But let’s see what happens. I honestly hope he wins the left will completely collapse on itself if that happens.</p>

        <p>Even if there was rampant fraud, there are still 10s of millions of Americans who legitimately did vote for Joe Biden even after he looked into the camera and told us to expect a Long Dark Winter. It's an upsetting realization about the people with whom we share this country.</p>

        <p>Someone is making a massive profit from this vaccine and these tests and masks, and if you dare question the need for these things then you are a “conspiracy theorist”. </p>
<p>How can anyone be so naive? So we’re now supposed to think that nobody is corrupt and government officials and scientists (as opposed to science) can’t be manipulated or bought off? That they always want the best for us individual little citizens? </p>
<p>I can’t imagine why would anyone just take it no questions asked. Risk your physical and financial  wellbeing paying for constant rona tests and rushed vaccines. If they have their way you’ll probably end up needing daily rona tests and masks even after you took their rushed vaccine (which will probably become subscription based).</p>
<p>What about the criteria used for lockdowns? You are not allowed to question it either. Don’t be a conspiracy theorist. Don’t you dare demand to know why are they destroying society and our lives, just swallow the out of context casedemic numbers they feed you 24/7 in mass media. </p>
<p>Who is going to pay for the consequences all of this? Us!  We will pay directly out of our pockets (daily rona tests to access daily life, masks) or through our taxes and the inevitable inflation and economic fallout that is going to follow these destructive policies (lockdowns, vaccines, adverse reactions to vaccines).</p>
<p>And the WHO and government officials take ZERO responsibility for the consequences of their decisions, despite the fact that we know only a handful of people are calling the shots.</p>
<p>Governments have zero accountability for the fact that they were absolutely unprepared to provide basic healthcare for their citizens during any contingency, that healthcare system was stripped off resources and personnel in years past through budget cuts, and even the fact that they continue to lack any plan to tackle the problem other than lockdowns and blaming their citizens for the spread of a disease. </p>
<p>They are brainwashing you 24/7 in mass media this is your fault! So you’ll hate the people who question the role of governments in all the suffering that is now taking place.</p>
<p>But keep drinking the koolaid and calling others conspiracy theorists for questioning the status quo. They will undoubtedly come after them one day too, no matter how good little pets they are.</p>

        <p>It drives me crazy, has no one literally ever read a book and actually LEARNED from it? Lots of people parrot the phrase "those who don't learn history are doomed to repeat it" <em>squak</em> yet here we are. How is it that only "conspiracy theorists" can think that government leaders and wealthy influencers could possibly collude to our detriment? History is literally FILLED with tyrants who have used propaganda and brainwashing techniques on their citizens in order to take control and dominate. History is FILLED with examples of authorities lying to the populace...</p>
<p>How are people so naive!? What, did that just magically stop happening? Did power hungry monsters cease to exist? Did we suddenly hop into a utopian universe where bad things don't happen anymore and evil people don't exist? What in the world does it take to wake people up? And now it's happening on a global scale. There will be no escape.</p>

        <p>Yup, don't you know, this is the year corporations stopped being corrupt and profit hungry. Amazon, Walmart, Target, ecommerce, Netflix, social media, media, Uber eats, big corporations whose small competitors are shut down, big Pharma, hospital execs, ALL lost their focus on profit, and simply push this narrative that makes them billions of dollars FOR YOUR SAFETY. </p>
<p>The US govt who convinced everyone for years that segregation was good, the Drug War was good, we should invade North Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, homosexuality is bad, and then was proven wrong, is no longer able to be wrong anymore. All those experts were wrong then, but not they are never going to be wrong again!</p>

        <p>LMAO, you guys are fucking moronic.</p>
<p>The reason people slipped into poverty wasn't because they weren't allowed to work. It's because the government gave y'all 1.2k dollar stimulus checks fucking <em>once</em>, then refused to do more. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, every other developed nation in the world has actually managed to support their people <em>without</em> needing them to work.</p>

        <p>The goal is to keep hospitalizations and deaths significantly lower in the upcoming period where many people will be spending time indoors with each other, which is one of the more dangerous circumstances for transmission.</p>
<p>The initial lockdowns were about flattening the curve, and they helped do that, keeping hospitals below full capacity, and allowing those who needed care to get it. Now, we’re seeing hospitals overwhelmed and infection rates climb quickly in unrestricted areas like the Dakotas. That’s why we’re back to locking down, not because the first lockdowns were supposed to eliminate the virus, but because the circumstances of the winter months present a more critical threat of spread.</p>
<p>And I could grasp your definition of necessary occupation in a normal, non pandemic setting. But for many types of jobs right now, slowing the spread of the virus is more necessary than having work happen in person, or at all. More government stimulus is absolutely needed to justify this trade off and the lack of such stimulus is definitely contributing to distaste for lockdowns, I imagine.</p>

<li>Norway’s top tax rate is 38%.  US it’s 37% + state, which can be another 13% or more.  In general income tax rates for the highest earners is significantly more in the US vs Norway.</li>
<li>Norway’s corporate tax rate is 22%, US it’s 21%, so basically the same </li>
<li>FICA for employees is 8.2% in Norway, vs ~7.6% in the US</li>
</ul>
<p>The big area where people pay more in Norway is sales tax, which is 25%, which is 3-4x what it is in most places in the US.  Sales tax is also a highly regressive tax, so doesn’t really fit with the “soak the rich” philosophy.</p>
<p>You’re talking out your ass if you think “if only we taxes the rich more we would be able to afford xx”.  It’s such an easily disproved talking point</p>

<p>Reduce the ludicrous fucking hours we subject our doctors to in their medical education. It doesn't fucking help, they're not robots, fucking hell. </p>
<p>Hire more diverse doctors, because racial bias in the medical field definitely does contribute to medical error. Did you know the black prognosis for skin cancer is fucking abysmal, because it's just harder for doctors to spot the signs before it's too late?</p>
<p>Or the fact that medical diagrams almost always depict white males, and dermatologists have only recently begun to change this?</p>
<p>Or you can hop onto /r/ChronicPain, check out the top page, and educate yourself on the current state of medicine and women, how misdiagonisis is common as all fuck, and women die in droves because doctors can't identify their pain, and won't take them seriously.</p>

        <p>Anarchy is advocated for on moral grounds, not practical ones. Your comment is like saying "the world isn't ready to end slavery, because we wouldn't know how to pick cotton without them".</p>
<p>Abolishing slavery is/was a moral imperative, even if that means renouncing cotton.</p>
<p>About scientists, there are many heterodox views. What you're exposed to are the ones given a platform by government and its media lackeys.</p>
<p>Do you realize the Nazis and Soviets had scientists too, and that they were educated in prestigious institutions? Fortunately not everyone was obtuse enough to think of them as a priest class.</p>

        <p>75% of the dead are the elderly. We could have focused on protecting the elderly while the rest living a normal life.</p>
<p>But no, you don't care because you want to blame Trump for everything.</p>

        <p>Yup, there is literally zero logical justification or reasoning, scientific or otherwise, that can justify locking down 100% of the population and quarantining the healthy.</p>
<p>Even if you assume lockdowns are the solution and an effective method (which I disagree with, but for the sake of argument, we'll allow it), there is zero justification to lock down <em>everyone</em> vs the actual afflicted. Imagine if we only locked down the vulnerable/elderly - the majority of whom aren't working - and how much more viable it would be to support just them financially, not to speak of the other costs to society of the lockdown "strategy". Utter madness.</p>
