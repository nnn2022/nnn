    <strong>"Don't be mean to the scared maskers!!"</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone sick to death of being told not to bother the mask obsessed who will continue to mask forever (because they care about people! but actually because they need their face blanky). See the thing is, I think: wear what you want- I don't care if someone wants to wear saran wrap on their heads (makes as much sense as a mask to me)...but given how horribly the maskers treated anyone not wearing a mask during all this, I'll be honest...I think they deserve to have their own treatment served right back to them. There is nothing wrong with a nasty look, a shake of the head, an eyeroll, or telling your child "stay away from that person in a mask. They have mental problems and we don't want to scare them.". This is all MUCH nicer than how they treated us. Not advocating violence or any kind of cruelty, but these folks were horrible to people who used their brains around masks...and I think they deserve a little discomfort right back</p></p>

        <p>Funny but true. Almost didn't get served because I refused but a win for me as I pointed out mask mandates have dropped. Started to feel like the 50s for a second.</p>

        <p>I would love, LOVE, to see based businesses refuse service to people who are wearing masks. And when some doomer says "but I have a medical condition I have to wear a mask" give them the same treatment as those with medical exemptions to not wear one being refused service because rules are rules...they can get their food delivered or get whatever they're buying at curbside pickup. And if that's just not an option well guess what? Now it's your turn to be shunned from society.</p>

        <p>We’re no better than them if we stoop to revenge—no matter how small that revenge is. We ought to continue to treat them with kindness and be an example to them of how decent human beings should act. If we continue to do that, then people will see all the more clearly who is in the wrong and be more likely to take the correct side (our side).</p>
