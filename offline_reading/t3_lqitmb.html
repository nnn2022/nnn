        <p>There’s a line in the movie The Matrix where Morpheus says, “Some people aren’t ready to be unplugged.”</p>
<p>It’s disturbing that in movies like it the elite show their hand but few people catch on.</p>

        <p>People will pay their 50% income taxes and stay in their pods, being force-fed bugs and they’ll still believe it’s all okay. </p>
<p>Rather than wake the fuck up and shake the system, they’ll just keep in line with whatever TPTB advises, hoping one day it’ll go back to “normal.”</p>
<p>That’s the sad part. I really don’t think we’ll ever see a “Mad Max” style fringe society cause so many people will just fall in line, even when shit gets real bad. Of course this may cause some desperation which could lead to crime and robberies. I watched Children of Men on the weekend and it sort of reminded me how it’ll be.... people will still have jobs, political protesters will be locked up, we’ll have a police state, but people will largely be used to it all and carry on with their day.</p>

        <p>yep, people are happy being quote unquote "slaves" and for the life of me i cant understand why. as the matrix images implies, the truth is there, so so so many people are reliant on the system they will never leave it. they dont even understand that is an option, news, politics and other nonsical things are so implemented in thier daily routine they cant comprehend a world without it. its a "nanny state", thats what i learned in sociology. the government have full control, and its so so so much deeper than most of you will realize.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>let me create a quick example from the premises i understand.</p>
<p>my names boris johnson, i want more money </p>
<p>okay boris heres what we will do</p>
<p>we will create adverts and news headlines and brainwash the masses to make them believe it is necisarry they pay 5% more tax. </p>
<p>done! well done sire, more money for us! hoooozah!</p>
<p>now thats what they did with covid 19 and masks and vaccines, adverts adverts adverts propogganda, targeted marketing, adverts, slogans, slogans, slogans, more adverts. </p>
<p>you see, as the nazis found out, if you say something for long enough, and enough times and with enough authority and confidence people will believe anything you say</p>

        <p>i never watched the matrix but that image is very relevant to todays society, people are unaware of bohemian grove and a bunch of other shit. just because YOU dont think its real, just because YOU think its crazy, that doesnt mean its not real. can you see my point? us fighting each other only helps them, it IS real and it NEEDS to be stopped.</p>

        <p>thank you thank you it all makes sense. i escaped the matrix in 2020 and ive been fighting ever since. i try my hardest to spread the light here on reddit and to my friends and family, in was starting to feel like i was crazy but i knew there was great truth in what i had found. this means the world to me, i said there was a war going on! we are going to win, the light cannot be stopped, it is inevitable. amen</p>

        <p>I will tell you why there isnt a revolution going on right now, it is a very simple and obvious answer. Most people are stuck in the capitalist matrix, they eat, work, sleep repeat. Most people rely on the "news" for "information" when in actuality the news is just a brainwashing tool.</p>
<p>most people are distacted by a large never ending array of things, things like social media, music, youtube, own personal beliefs, alot of people are depressed, alot of people are just lost souls right now. all because a bunch of elite pedos want to hide thier tracks. </p>
<p>And to further help you understand, this research i have been doing has taken months and i, AM only one person. the news, is a vast, global connected mean.</p>
<p>In conclusion, people dont even know this shit is going on, alot of people have forgotten about the epstien scandal... that was the whole point of the covid hoax. To distact people from pedo epstien, pedo joe, pedo trump, pedo gates, pedo maxwell, pedo prince andrew, pedo clintons. I was very close to exposing it all, but i lost alot of motivation.</p>
<p>if you want to help, take a look through these imgur dumps.</p>
<p>i will reiterate this one last time as i cannot keep giving my soul and life force to this but COVID-!9 started in march 2019, this is the exact same time the jeffrey epstien scandal was about to BLOW THE FUCK UP. it was a distaction, elites playing thier cards, think of the governemt as a gang, they just own everything, they are in control, they make decisions to benfit them, they dont care about us. its like a gang war, government are a gang and they have the "law" and "authority" to do whatever they want.</p>
