    <strong>"I hope we don't have to start working from the office again" says the person who has technical issues every few hours.</strong>
    <p><p>This is something that has been irritating me lately. I keep seeing people post about how bored they have been throughout this year working from home, how they have binge watched every possible netflix series etc. Honestly, I'm quite jealous because I didn't get to be bored at all. Usually at the office I would be able to sneak a chat with a co-worker here and there or just get up from my desk and walk to a water cooler to stretch my legs. With everyone working from home and the work load increasing as well I barely remember what it felt like not to be stressed all the time.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing for me has been the people from my place of work who say they hope they never have to return to the office since working from home has been so much easier for them. And I am glad that they are happy and that they have more spare time, but at the same time I see those same people constantly leaving their tasks for others or disappearing due to technical difficulties whenever things get busy.</p>
<p>Not entirely the same thing but at my mom's place or work, some of the registered nurses stopped coming to work altogether because they were scared of Covid... leaving all the work for the handful of nurses and nursing assistants who did countless hours of overtime to cover for them. </p>
<p>Sorry for rambling, just really had to vent..</p></p>

<p>Join them. If they want to play stupid games, they win stupid prizes.</p>

        <p>I’m not going to lie, working from home has its positives. Getting to wake up later, not having to sit in traffic, leaving to go out of town right at 5:00 on Friday, etc. However, I crave human interaction, and this outweighs all the luxuries of working from home. </p>
<p>But you’re right. We shouldn’t make this the “new normal.” I can only see productivity gradually decreasing and a whole lot of people not developing any social skills if we never go back to the workplace again.</p>
