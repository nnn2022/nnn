    <strong>Lack of threshold</strong>
    <p><p>A principle of legal protection is that laws must have thresholds, criteria and evidence to justify them. For instance, to be charged with drink driving you must have drunk alcohol and the amount of alcohol in your blood must be above a certain amount according to the laws of your country. There is irrefutable evidence alcohol impairs your senses when you drive. Legal thresholds and criteria makes it possible to appeal wrongful arrests. If the police arrested someone for drink driving when the blood alcohol level  was below the legal limit, the arrest would be wrong. Non alcoholic drinks are not covered by drink driving laws as there is no evidence the impair senses when driving. </p>
<p>Imagine if drink driving was a criminal offence but there was no criteria as to what type of drink is covered by the law which means a person can be arrested for drink driving if they have drunk anything. The government doesn’t have to provide evidence a drink affects senses which means and there is no threshold how much of a drink you have consumed to be charged with drink driving. Such a law would be a disaster. People would be fearful they could be arrested regardless of what they drink which means drivers go thirsty. Without a threshold or criteria appealing drink driving arrests would not be possible. Businesses loose trade as drivers don’t want to drink before they go in their cars.</p>
<p>Lockdowns are an unmitigated disaster and have caused massive social and economic damage.  Businesses are forced to close. There are severe restrictions what people can’t or can do.  Basic things like having visitors in your home are criminalised.  Below are the current restrictions in England and Wales. </p>

<p>My issue with the lockdowns is that extreme measures can be introduced and there is no threshold or criteria as to what characteristics a disease must posses to introduce lockdowns eg fatality rate, severity of symptoms, case numbers, how infectious the disease is etc which means governments can introduce lockdowns regardless of the characteristics of a disease.   In addition, governments can introduce lockdowns without scientific evidence to justify lockdowns. One justification for lockdowns is that healthy asymptomatic people can spread the disease. As per the FOI request I sent to the National Health Service in the UK, the government couldn’t providence evidence of asymptomatic transmission </p>
<p>Do you agree what I have mentioned above is a major issue with lockdowns. </p>
<p>“Thank you for your communication dated 30 October 2020.  </p>
<p>NHS England has assessed your communication as a request under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000. As such, your request is being dealt with under the terms of the FOI Act, and has been allocated the following reference number: FOI-2010-1275333.  </p>
<p>Your exact request was:  </p>
<p>“I would like to make a freedom of information request regarding  the subject of asymptomatic transmission. Could the following questions be answered :-  </p>
<p>* Has any research been carried out by the government into asymptomatic transmission.  </p>
<p>* If research has been carried out into asymptomatic transmission, can the following be answered   </p>
<p>How do asymptomatic carriers spread the disease as unlike symptomatic carriers they will not cough or sneeze.  </p>
<p>How long do asymptomatic carriers stay infectious.  </p>
<p>Are asymptomatic less or just as infectious as symptomatic carriers.  </p>
<p>* Have there been documented instances of people who tested positive but had no symptoms and those around them fell I’ll.  </p>
<p>* Is the possibility of healthy asymptomatic people spreading coronavirus a major factor in placing draconian lockdown laws on the entire healthy population.  </p>
<p>* If there is no evidence of asymptomatic transmission, would the government still feel draconian lockdowns which apply to whole population would be justified.”  </p>
<p>NHS England does not hold information in relation to your request."</p></p>
