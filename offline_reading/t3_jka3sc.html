    <strong>I'm no one special but I'd like to see what you guys believe and why</strong>
    <p><p>A debate is fine, but no insults or disrespect. Do you think masks work? Lockdown? Do you have any evidence to support your beliefs? Is it considered evidence to you as a result of a cognitive bias? I'm pro-mask, pro-lockdown-if-necessary, and COVID-19 exists and is quite deadly <strong>and</strong> severe.</p></p>

        <p>All you have to do is listen is the WHO daily conference videos, open up the CDC and read what they have to say. </p>
<p>The problem with people like you, is that everything is taken at face value and you don’t do your own research. Here is someone that has actually done all of that, https://maskupmn.org/</p>
<p>Covid is not deadly, have you seen the suicide rates of late? Have you seen TB rates? What about AIDS? Yes TB is a bacteria but it still kills and it still is contagious. There are way more serious illnesses (especially viruses) out there that kill far greater. </p>
<p>Do yourself a favour and start doing your own research, don’t go by what the news tells you. Just to give you an idea of the media, who owns Fox News? Yes. Disney. So you telling me you would believe a news channel that is owned by a cartoon company? </p>
<p>Anyway... there is enough evidence on either of the above websites where they themselves, leader of WHO have said a number of things people on this group keep saying. In the beginning of the year it was fine, fair enough they need to do their homework, understand more about the virus but for +8 months changing their thoughts every week is not cutting it for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>People up there assume that the real world is static and everything will work exactly to their plans.</p>
<p>They don't realize that they themselves don't understand the complex mechanisms at play that makes the world run.</p>
<p>Small/medium businesses employ more than half of the population and are impacted most by the lockdowns. Sure, companies like Amazon, Walmart can easily set up online shopping because of their size. I have worked for such small businesses. The total employee count is often less than 5. Sometimes not even that and it might be just me and my boss.</p>
<p>I also worked with people in warehouses where both the man and the woman has to work to pay for expenses. They live together but have little time together because they have to work different hours.</p>
<p>Many such people also have kids. You are asking people in such hard financial situations to cut back work just so they can supervise the kids for the online Zoom school, which is close to useless and creates anxiety for the kid. They disproportionately hurt the poor and further create the divide.</p>
<p>Some have the argument that people like us that are against the lockdowns only care about the economy and not about health. As I said, many rich and those in high ranks are not in a position to understand them, because they might have never experienced being in the bottom of the economy. Economy is very much interconnected with health. How healthy do you think you will be if you got laid off from your job and you were struggling financially prior to be laid off? Especially if you got kids? It's not a coincidence the population in wealthier countries live longer and are healthier.</p>
<p>All that could be acceptable if its actually that deadly. Spoiler Alert: It's not. You know back when they said 3% of people that have it die? Well, that number seems high, until you realize that its obtained by assuming that only the people testing positive have it.</p>
<p>Months later, mortality rates have dropped fraction of what it was, yet cases are higher than ever. We should be celebrating, since its way under 3% of people that die. Actually, much under 1%, because continued testing keeps showing more positives. Maybe even more people have it, lowering the mortality rate even further, making it even less deadlier?</p>
<p>Average age of people who die are in their 80s! Considering that's the approximate lifespan in western countries, how is that deadly?</p>
<p>The idea that "you'll kill grandma" is also false because the person who's more vulnerable to the disease has a higher viral load, thus higher chance to infect, than those that are healthy and thus lower viral load and thus lower chance to infect. With some families having multiple members under the same roof, it also means lockdowns <em>encourage</em> everyone staying home, further increasing infection.</p>
<p>They used the argument, flatten the curve as an excuse to justify the lockdowns. We're way, way past that.</p>
<p>Why do the lockdowns still exist, and are even tightening?</p>

        <p>The reason I'm for lockdown if it's absolutely necessary is because of the impacts it has on people. But if it's absolutely necessary, it'll have to be that way.</p>

<p>Lockdown contains the spread to a single household, and within just over 2 weeks it should be fine to ease out lockdown. That's only assuming people follow it. And you also assume that the 2 outcomes of COVID are full recovery or death, that's false. A healthy 18 year old can be heavily affected. There are permanent and long-lasting damages being sustained to the body which we may or may not know, including damages to the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, blood vessels (also blood clots in every organ) and neurological damage. They can be in asymptomatic patients and the ones in intensive care. Not only that, this is a new enemy which we have no knowledge about. For all we know, it could damage thought processes in the brain and the current generations will be dumber (just an example).</p>

        <p>Permanent and long lasting effects are also true for the flu. After a bad case of the flu few years ago, I was coughing for 4 months after that. It was so bad that I couldn't sleep properly. Don't tell me flu has no long lasting effects! I don't know if the flu I had during that time is going to come back and bite me in the ass in the later years! The act of coughing itself significantly stresses the body.</p>
<p>What you are saying assumes lockdowns have zero health impacts, which is false. People lose their business, which is extremely difficult to get it going in the first place. Kids lose the critical social interaction, which is only possible with in-person learning. Masks further make it worse as people under 19 years old the mortality rate is even below the flu! For really young kids it's going to seriously hamper their social and language development and create a generation of hermits and recluses.</p>
<p>Many people are deathly afraid to go to the hospitals. They put off their cancer treatments, problems with heart conditions, which they'll pay over long term! The press conference by the Florida governor said half of people with <em>brain lesions</em> refuse to go to the hospital!</p>
<p>And many people are suicidal. All the parties, eating out, meeting people, or travel all canceled! Do you think that does not matter?</p>

        <p>It does assume that lockdowns have no health impacts, I just wanted to say what it's for. I should mention I'm in one of the most important periods for education which decides my future too. Lockdown will affect people massively, which is why I believe it should be a last resort. Masks are a minor inconvenience and I'll also need a source for the mortality rate for COVID being lower than the flu, for the age range 10-19. It affects kids a lot, yes, but the only reason we have 1 million deaths is because we had a near-international lockdown. The numbers would have been much higher if we didn't do that.</p>
<p>For the people afraid to go to hospitals, why is that? Due to lockdown or the fear of catching COVID? I'll also mention (but I'll remove later) that I have been depressed and passively suicidal for just over 5 years, I understand what would happen to those people. If it's the only way, the government should be helping.</p>

<p>Kids are at extremely low risk. Their chance of catching it and dying is at 0.00084%</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC Numbers</a> from a month back</p>
<p>0-1 yrs - 20</p>
<p>1-4 yrs -14</p>
<p>5-14 yrs -30</p>
<p>15-24 yrs - 333</p>
<p>25-34 yrs - 1,405</p>
<p>35-44 yrs -3,675</p>
<p>If we add up the numbers 64 kids aged 0-14 years old have died out of a population of 73.7 million. You need a big number calculator to get the percentage due to the moratlity rate being so low for that age group. Lockdowns make zero sense when you factor in what they said about this up coming winter. They said infections will rise because of the cold and everyone being in close proximity of one another. If that is the case locking us down in the spring is probably what contributed to the rise in cases we see now, not to mention deaths. I'm sorry but for those of us paying attention there are far too many contradictions to take any of this seriously anymore.</p>

        <p>Worrying about downvotes is irrelevant. Focus on constructing a consistent argument that doesn't contradict itself and is reasonable. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I have yet to see the pro lockdown/maskers present one. For example, people from this camp say they support it to save lives, but as soon as we present our side of the debate they hope we catch covid and die. WTF? Then there's the suicides which they say while tragic it's an acceptable cost. What happened to, "If it saves even one life." ?</p>
<p>When we point out the rise in cases where mandates we're issued its blamed on non compliance or correlation doesn't mean causation, but in the places where the cases dropped after the mandates we're issued they point to it as evidence masks work. It can't be both.</p>

        <p>Yeah just wanted to point that out. Anyway everyone wants it to go back to normal, but bc of certain people they aren't allowing it. We follow lockdown and masks and stuff, and others ruin it. Kind of like when this 1 kid misbehaves and the entire class stays back. We just really hate the fact that not only are they making it worse, they're disregarding the health and lives of others. The "If it saves one life" still stands, but if the death of 1 person can save a hundred... yeah.</p>

        <p>That's the thing though. As I pointed out to someone else expecting 100% compliance is stupid. If you blame people not wearing mask for dragging things out then you also have to blame people not wearing mask properly too. They're just as guilty as those going around sans mask. </p>
<p>You will NEVER get 100% people to comply with any law. People love to use the seatbelt comparison when debating mask failing to realize people get tickets for not wearing seat belts all the time. Under 7,000 people in the U.S. aged 0-44 have died of covid CDC's own stats. That's out of 330 million plus Americans. That is in the zero percentile statistically. </p>
<p>We're putting no one at risk who weren't already at risk before all of this. </p>
<p><em>"The "If it saves one life" still stands, but if the death of 1 person can save a hundred... yeah."</em></p>
<p>Yeah until someone close to you dies of suicide due to the measures. If that isn't an unnecessary needless death than I don't know what is. I know more people who have lost their job or got evicted or have had their whole lives destroyed by the measures than people who were infected and died from the virus itself. My job included which closed it's door this week. Now I don't know how I'm going to feed my family but according to you I should just shrug and say to my wife and 3 yr old son, "Well I know I can't pay rent or put food in y'alls mouths but it doesn't matter because we saved someone who we'll probably never meet and will probably only live for another two years or so if you're crying about malnourishment you need to suck it up."</p>

<p>If lockdown prolongs and support isn't given, that's correct. If lockdown is needed, it should be just over 2 weeks (I'd say 18 days) and no longer. People should work remotely and if not possible, they'll just get paid by the government. That's one part of the problem, the other part are the people who refuse to wear masks or violated lockdown, which may have extended lockdown.</p>

&rt;What annoys me about people like you is your inability to pay attention to trends and the fact that you have no idea what the end game is with authorities and the drug pushers/vaccine makers. <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/10/27/covid-vaccine-trials.aspx?cid_source=dnl&amp;cid_medium=email&amp;cid_content=art1HL&amp;cid=20201027Z1&amp;mid=DM692979&amp;rid=997282959&amp;fbclid=IwAR1lmKUik66ru-vuyynFO59YVmnRs_gNbGmzi8tlukH7Ha0dE180asCDShI">The only criterion for a successful COVID-19 vaccine is a reduction of symptoms shared by both COVID-19 and the common cold</a> not prevention of infection. This is what I mean by conflicting information and inconsistent narrative. The lockdowns are supposed to prevent infection, right? Once the trials start the goal post is moved and they state the vaccine won't prevent infection and that's not the goal we just want to limit the symptoms. Oh, you mean the mild symptoms that are already reported by the majority of those infected? Btw they <a href="https://summit.news/2020/10/26/health-expert-mask-wearing-will-remain-mandatory-even-after-a-covid-vaccine/">don't ever want you to stop wearing mask</a> and yes <a href="https://i.redd.it/o301qo6vd9v51.jpg">this</a> is about <a href="https://archive.is/Jhxti">control</a>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"<em>If lockdown is needed, it should be just over 2 weeks (I'd say 18 days) and no longer. People should work remotely and if not possible, they'll just get paid by the government. That's one part of the problem, the other part are the people who refuse to wear masks or violated lockdown, which may have extended lockdown."</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You're arguing for something that has not and will not happen so mentioning that is a waste of breath and doesn't change my current predicament concerning taking care of my family and is completely out of touch and pisses me off quite frankly. So unless you're going to cut me a check and send it in the mail or wire me some money STOP MENTIONING THAT. Oh, and I was one of the many Americans that did not and still haven't received a stimulus check.</p>

        <p>No I didn't vote for Trump. In fact since I've been paying attention, unlike most Americans, I can clearly see the whole political system is so corrupt it is beyond fixing by voting. Not knowing what you're going to do to feed your family is taxing so when I run into someone who is out of touch it tends to get to you especially when they're being willfully ignorant. </p>
<p><em>"I mentioned that to say the government's handling of COVID is wrong,"</em></p>
<p>And yet you're still arguing in favor of giving it more authority or at least continuing the same measures that put me in this situation. Don't you see how infuriating that is? It's easy to take that position because you're doing fine. What about the rest of us? Even more insulting is you think you're considerate <em>just</em> because you wear a mask. Unreal.</p>

        <p>If I go into lockdown, it may literally destroy my life since I'm at the most crucial stage in education.

<p>And there it is. This is an easy position to take since you're not in the real world. You're a kid with no real responsibilities. You can get an education at any point in your life honesty, my uncle graduated college in his late 50's and now is a Principal at a high school. I only have so much time to get enough money to put food on the table before me and my family start suffering effects of malnourishment. But I guess that's ok because we saved some old person I don't know.</p>
<p><em>"I just want people to follow other regulations to prevent lockdown, but if it's needed we'll just have to deal with it</em>."</p>
<p>No. You'll deal with it by yourself. I'm done with this theater and I'm going to do what I can to feed my family. What kind of parent put others over their own kid's? That is what you want me to do. Life isn't black and white youngster, theres a whole lot of different shades of gray and this is way more complex than your inexperienced mind can grasp.</p>

&rt;This is a false premise due to the fact that not enough time has passed to definitively determine that. It's only been 8 or 9 months since the medical establishment was aware of it's existence (if you were to ignore the patents that were filed regarding covid 19). Now say 10-15 years down the road we're still seeing people who contracted the virus with health problems then we can say there are long term effects but not at this point.</p>

        <p>COVID exists.  All but a few loonies ~~deny~~ agree with that. (edit: wrong word, oops!)</p>
<p>Calling it quite deadly and severe I take issue with.  It's deadly to a very small subset of the population.  This subset should likely also be worried about the flu.  Most of us have nothing to fear from the virus.  I do not believe "long COVID" is a thing and will continue to not believe it's a thing until there is data conclusively proving otherwise.</p>
<p>I think it's quite likely that masks don't do anything.  At best, they might reduce the rate of transmission, but they will never drop the transmission rate to zero.  I think there's about a zero percent chance that masks act as black holes for viruses.  Even <strong>if</strong> they stopped all viruses that you breathed out, what happens when you adjust your mask?  What happens when you take it off and stuff it in your pocket or purse?  Does the virus not then get moved to your hand?  And then get transmitted to things you touch?</p>
<p>But let's say for the sake of the argument it stop all viruses and they all stay firmly stuck in the mask forever.  It <em>still</em> would require 100% of the population wearing masks correctly 100% of the time for an extended period of time for the virus to just go away.  That isn't in any way realistic.  </p>
<p>In short, masks may slow the spread, but they won't stop the spread.  Slowing the spread accomplishes nothing in the end; it just makes this whole situation drag on longer.</p>
<p>Much of the same can be said about lockdowns.  The only difference is while the costs of wearing a mask (as I see them) are more intangible, the costs of a lockdown are serious and undeniable.  Suicides, substance abuse, domestic violence and poverty are all skyrocketing.  Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jjuhjx/opioid_deaths_skyrocket_mental_health_suffers_due/gah8e8v/">link</a> to a post I made earlier today that suggests to me that it's quite likely the lockdowns cost more young lives who died from overdoses than they saved in British Columbia.</p>
<p>All of this for a virus that, for most of us, poses less risk than riding in a car.  If you're old and have comorbidities you should probably be taking precautions - and I'm totally fine with society making some small adjustments to help those people protect themselves; things like early morning grocery store hours reserved for seniors - but completely shutting down the economy and changing our world is incredibly, incredibly short-sighted.</p>
<p>If you want more information I recommend /r/LockdownSkepticism.  This sub is a bit more low effort (lots of memes and rants).  It's more for people to blow off steam.  /r/LockdownSkepticism is much more heavily moderated and tries to focus more on posting papers, expert commentary, or scientific developments.  It's not <em>all</em> that, but if you really want to get a better idea of the arguments against the lockdown you might find more information there.</p>

        <p>This this this. Except I’d love to tag on to add to the costs of wearing a mask bit. Other than inevitably causing severe developmental hurdles for the young children living through this, there are many of us who cannot wear masks medically. I don’t care if you don’t “think” there are, there are. These range from breathing issues, skin conditions, anxiety, PTSD, sensory disorders and the list goes on. I have PTSD from a trauma in which my mouth and nose were forcibly covered. I cannot wear a mask without severe panic attacks. The mandates include medical exemptions but stores often deny entry even with this. My life has been destroyed because of this. My choices are to stay home, which was causing me to become isolated and suicidal, or go out and experience intense panic attacks when I do with a mask on. There are plenty of others like me and I would not be lying if I told you I hadn’t considered offing myself panicking that this will last a long time. I can’t continue with this. Masks have a huge mental toll and can even have physical effects on some of us and we factor into all those stats you see about increasing rates of mental heath issues and suicides you hear about when it comes to lockdowns.</p>
<p>Not to mention masks do shit. I live in an area where everyone wears them. I rarely see someone without and our cases have been rising ever since the mandate. Cloth and surgical masks are not meant to contain virus nanoparticles, fitted N95s are but even those with N95s out and about don’t have properly fitted ones. And with people taking them off when they eat and get in their cars and at times during the day and then touching them and putting them back on and touching other things, they’re actually a huge risk to spread germs at a rapid rate. They also have this huge psychological impact, a constant reminder that we need to continue panicking about this and that nothing is normal and that this will continue on. Even if you don’t realize this, it is affecting you subconsciously, as is not seeing facial expressions from others-this is a form of isolation in its own way.</p>

<p>As I wrote in another comment: " And you also assume that the 2 outcomes of COVID are full recovery or death, that's false. A healthy 18 year old can be heavily affected. There are permanent and long-lasting damages being sustained to the body which we may or may not know, including damages to the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, blood vessels (also blood clots in every organ) and neurological damage. They can be in asymptomatic patients and the ones in intensive care. Not only that, this is a new enemy which we have no knowledge about. For all we know, it could damage thought processes in the brain and the current generations will be dumber (just an example)."</p>

<p>That's exactly what they do, reduce the rate of transmission. Obviously it will not drop the transmission rate to zero afaik, but there is a problem. People aren't educated nor informed on how to handle masks, that leads to people readjusting them incorrectly or contaminating other surfaces. If you take it off, you should place it in a sealable container whatever they are called. Now, your hand is contaminated, but good thing you were informed by scientists that you should sanitise your hands after touching a mask. Now, you're fine hopefully.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; In short, masks may slow the spread, but they won't stop the spread. Slowing the spread accomplishes nothing in the end; it just makes this whole situation drag on longer </p>
<p>.. yes. It slows the spread, enough for us to maintain a managable hospital capacity, and give us time to develop treatments and hopefully a vaccine that can further reduce the spread. Maybe in some time it'll mutate and become less severe; when that happens, we win. If we eradicate it, we win. Even if we prevent all those deaths via treatment and vaccines, we win.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Much of the same can be said about lockdowns. The only difference is while the costs of wearing a mask (as I see them) are more intangible, the costs of a lockdown are serious and undeniable. Suicides, substance abuse, domestic violence and poverty are all skyrocketing. Here's a link to a post I made earlier today that suggests to me that it's quite likely the lockdowns cost more young lives who died from overdoses than they saved in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The damages of lockdown are severe, but if it's absolutely necessary and it will benefit us in the future, it has to be done. That doesn't mean the government declares lockdown and abandons, it is their responsibility to support us while we are in lockdown. Which they haven't obviously. The effects of lockdown still exist, so efforts should be made to mitigate it as much as possible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; All of this for a virus that, for most of us, poses less risk than riding in a car. If you're old and have comorbidities you should probably be taking precautions - and I'm totally fine with society making some small adjustments to help those people protect themselves; things like early morning grocery store hours reserved for seniors - but completely shutting down the economy and changing our world is incredibly, incredibly short-sighted </p>
<p>First paragraph shows that it's severe. Lockdown is the main issue for a lot of people, makes sense. Masks are small adjustments, social distancing are slightly larger adjustments but based on the risks, it's acceptable.</p>
<p>Also that sub seems much more intimidating to approach so I'm here.</p>

        <p>&rt; As I wrote in another comment: " And you also assume that the 2 outcomes of COVID are full recovery or death, that's false. A healthy 18 year old can be heavily affected. There are permanent and long-lasting damages being sustained to the body which we may or may not know, including damages to the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, blood vessels (also blood clots in every organ) and neurological damage. They can be in asymptomatic patients and the ones in intensive care. Not only that, this is a new enemy which we have no knowledge about. For all we know, it could damage thought processes in the brain and the current generations will be dumber (just an example)."</p>
<p>Yes, that's referred to as "long COVID" which I've addressed.  To date I have seen no data suggesting that this is a real thing.  I'm sure some people who suffer from a serious infection can have long term complications, but this isn't unique to COVID.  Have you never had the flu and felt the effects linger for weeks or months after?</p>
<p>&rt; .. yes. It slows the spread, enough for us to maintain a managable hospital capacity, and give us time to develop treatments and hopefully a vaccine that can further reduce the spread. Maybe in some time it'll mutate and become less severe; when that happens, we win. If we eradicate it, we win. Even if we prevent all those deaths via treatment and vaccines, we win.</p>
<p>​Hospitals are already at manageable capacity and outside of a few areas which regularly see hospitals overwhelmed this was never not the case.  If you want to hold out for a vaccine go for it.  We have no guarantee that a vaccine is coming or that it will be able to be distributed to everyone or that it will be 100% effective.</p>
<p>&rt; The damages of lockdown are severe, but if it's absolutely necessary and it will benefit us in the future, it has to be done. That doesn't mean the government declares lockdown and abandons, it is their responsibility to support us while we are in lockdown. Which they haven't obviously. The effects of lockdown still exist, so efforts should be made to mitigate it as much as possible.</p>
<p>​But it will <em>not</em> benefit us in the future.  Did you just ignore the example I cited?  People are suffering <em>all</em> over the world and this <em>is</em> leading to deaths at worst or lower quality of life at best for tens of millions.</p>
<p>&rt; First paragraph shows that it's severe. Lockdown is the main issue for a lot of people, makes sense. Masks are small adjustments, social distancing are slightly larger adjustments but based on the risks, it's acceptable.</p>
<p>The first paragraph shows it's severe in your eyes.  You have not convinced me that it is.</p>
<p>&rt; Also that sub seems much more intimidating to approach so I'm here.</p>
<p>Why?  It's way more thoughtful than this place.  I think this thread would go over better there, honestly.</p>

<p>It's not necessarily the same as long COVID, it's just the damages. Also no the flu always went away after abt a week or two for me.</p>

<p>That's good right now, so maintaining it is important. We should hold out mainly for treatment since a vaccine like you said is not guaranteed. Realistically it'll be given to 60-70% of the population, and it'll be around 80% effective but not permanent. It's good enough, different restrictions are just different ways to reduce the spread.</p>

<p>I didn't see it sorry but I agree that it causes a lot of suffering. If it is needed, it happens. The gov should provide resources for most people, and help should be available for people with suicidal tendencies, abusive home environments etc. it's impossible to escape it. The best we can do is try to help as much as possible, but it seems like the gov are incapable.</p>

        <p>You just said the effects of the flu went away after one or two weeks for you. That’s YOU. </p>
<p>I had covid. The effects went away after a couple of weeks as well. I’ve been perfectly fine since. I’m 32. But that’s me.</p>
<p>But the flu does cause a lot of long term issues. I know quite a few young people who nearly died from the flu. Not a single person I know who is young and relatively healthy has died or been particularly affected by covid (and I’m from a hard-hit area where most people I know got it). Everyone I know who died or was hospitalized was older than 65. </p>
<p>Covid really doesn’t affect young people, which is truly incredible. You can give me these ambiguous “long term issues” argument all day, but most of those symptoms could easily be attributed to chronic fatigue disorders and/or depression, which can just as easily be induced by lockdown and feelings of hopelessness.</p>
<p>Hell, a friend of mine from childhood died after catching the common cold on an international flight home. It was maybe 60 hours from the time she landed until she passed. A true one in a billion case.</p>
<p>My point is Covid was scary when we locked down in March. But 8 months later, we know that it’s not that deadly to majority of the population, and that we actually caused a lot of deaths because we employed policies like putting Covid positive patients in nursing homes and venting every person upon admission to the hospital. Honestly, if we would have done NOTHING, we would have probably saved more people.</p>
<p>You make it like we don’t have a choice to lockdown. When has lockdown EVER been an option? Why would you ever think that an inefficient entity such as government bureaucracy would be able to find an innovative solution that would benefit everyone? Lockdown was by far the dumbest thing we could do.</p>

<p>Except, they're suspiciously prevalent in recovered COVID-19 patients.

<p>It wasn't exactly scary, and you keep focusing on how deadly it is. You ignore the actual damages a virus like COVID causes. Also, that's a big claim you made at the end. I'll need sources for that.</p>

<p>You're nitpicking my words here.  The point I'm making is these "long term damages" that we keep hearing about have yet to be conclusively proven.  If you know of some research that says otherwise that I've missed please share, I'd love to see it.</p>

<p>Agreed!  I mean hell, we can't get the opioid epidemic under control even without a pandemic going on so of course they wouldn't be able to handle it when it's worse.  This is also not to even mention the countries around the world where the government simply does not have the resources (or is too corrupt) to care for its citizens.  The World Bank estimates up to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/10/07/covid-19-to-add-as-many-as-150-million-extreme-poor-by-2021">150 million people could be thrown into extreme poverty by next year</a>.  This likely won't be happening in the US, Canada or Europe but in the third world where resources to help the poor are already stretched thin.  How many of those people will die from poverty-related illnesses?  How many young women are going to be forced into prostitution just to survive?  How many children will be put to work just to be sure the family can keep itself fed?  How many lives must we have saved to make all of this worthwhile?</p>

<p>I have to wonder how many of these effects would be seen with people who had the flu if the flu were scrutinized as heavily as COVID.  That might be the skeptic in me talking, but it's a question worth asking.  For exampl, it's worth noting that <em>all</em> flu-like illnesses can increase the odds of stroke - here's a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899905/">source</a> for that.

<p>No sources, I forgot to mention that it's purely a guess and doesn't take into account a lot of factors. 60-70% of the population because of certain antivaxxers and covid deniers. 80% effective because I don't think a 100% effective vaccine would be possible, just basing it on the flu vaccine. It's also why I think it may not be permanent. There's no real reason why I'm basing it on the flu vaccine, maybe because it's similar? Bad logic but it's just a guess.</p>

If you compare COVID-19 and influenza, there is a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2768098">6 to 7 fold increase</a>, making it more severe.</p>

<p>Probably not everyone!  Worst-case estimates put the herd immunity threshold at 70%.  Other studies suggest it could be as low as 10-20% <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160762v2">Source</a>.  It's important to keep in mind that, despite how the media is reporting it, herd immunity is not some crazy theory.  Even if we get out of this via a vaccine, that's herd immunity too.  I think there's probably a lot of variation in herd immunity thresholds based on populations, but certainly some places seem to have reached it (also important to note herd immunity doesn't mean that the virus is <em>gone</em>, it just sustains itself at extremely low levels to the point where it's not an issue anymore).</p>
<p>And when you say we have to hope it's worth it: you're right, since it's the course of action we have chosen then we do need to hope it's worth it.  What makes me mad is this cost-benefit analysis <em>was never done</em>.  Everyone who pointed out the costs of the lockdown from the start was told that they were being selfish.  Even today when you have highly respected scientists like the author of the Great Barrington Declaration pointing out the costs and suggesting a different way, people are absolutely shitting all over them or suggesting they're being funded by the Kochs (which of course in today's world means anything they say is wrong).  The fact that the media is largely silencing one side of the discussion should frighten you.</p>
<p>&rt; First time hearing about flu-like illnesses increasing risks of a stroke, but the increase in risk is important. For example, risk of a heart attack increases 5 fold with the regular flu. If you compare COVID-19 and influenza, there is a 6 to 7 fold increase, making it more severe.</p>
<p>I wasn't questioning the severity, merely pointing out that the media is not reporting on this honestly.  I do think COVID is worse than the flu <em>depending on your age</em>.  For the elderly COVID is certainly more dangerous; for the young it is less dangerous.</p>
<p>One thing I haven't addressed is: do lockdowns even work?  You have places like Argentina that have had very strict lockdowns and deaths are still climbing (I'm using deaths because it's a better metric; lots of places have apparent spikes in cases but that can be partially attributed to the number of tests being conducted).  Europe had strict lockdowns in many places and they're experiencing a second wave.  Sweden had a very minimalistic lockdown approach (essentially no lockdown at all) and their death rate has been close to zero since late July.  It's certainly possible lockdowns are working but we simply do not have the data at this point to conclude that they are.</p>

        <p>To be clear, I'm not saying there is unequivocal evidence to suggest that lockdowns don't do anything, but there certainly exists plenty of evidence to question.</p>
<p>Let me use my state's data as an example.  I live in Maryland.  Here's a link to our state's data: https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/</p>
<p>There's a map here and underneath two charts (the site loads slow so be patient).  The chart on the right shows the number of tests per day and the solid black line represents the 7-day average of the % of positive cases.  We peaked on about April 17th - a full month after the lockdown began, and a day before a mask mandate went into effect (and this is not evidence that masks stopped the increase as it would take likely at least a week for the impacts of a mask mandate to be seen).</p>
<p>Cases kinda leveled off around then, then started to decline, with a slight bump on May 27th and then a continued steady decline.  On May 29th, Maryland allowed restaurants to open up for outdoor dining.  Me and some of my friends fully embraced this.  In my town there was a whole street that was blocked off to allow for more tables to be set up outside.  Open container laws were no longer enforced, so you could order a to-go drink and walk around with it.  <em>Lots</em> of people were doing this.  I saw plenty of people out, and very few of them with masks.</p>
<p>On June 12th indoor dining was allowed again at 50% capacity.  I can tell you that some of the bars I went to were <em>really</em> pushing their luck with this.  One bar in particular definitely exceeded their capacity, nobody was wearing masks and nobody was social distancing.  Now, this is all just one town in Maryland and it's not a huge one but I wouldn't be surprised if it was similar elsewhere.</p>
<p>If lockdowns helped, you would expect to see <em>some</em> impact on the shape of the curve, wouldn't you?  But the 7 day average continued to steadily decline and still consistently remains below 5%.  This, of course, does not prove that lockdowns don't work, but it certainly provides some evidence to suggest that maybe they don't.  And if people aren't obeying lockdowns then that's just <em>further</em> proof that they aren't helping.</p>
<p>Many of us here take issue with the fact that in the minds of many it's simply a foregone conclusion that lockdowns work.  They might indeed, but they have never been attempted in history and based on the past 7 months we really don't have a lot of data to support their efficacy.  Again, that doesn't mean they're useless, but people should be asking the question and discussing this objectively which is something that is not happening.</p>

        <p>Anesthesiaguy here, I’m pro mask and anti-lockdown.  Primarily because I think it’s more detriment than benefit, IE compliance will not be high enough to get a desired outcome.</p>
<p>Masks on the other hand.  I simply do not understand why or how someone would refuse to wear one.  They’re safe (we wear them all the time in the ORs, and have for decades).  And the data to this point, is still being collected.</p>
<p>Reality is the mortality doesn’t scare me, the sequelae does.  And who knows the long term ramifications, whether herd immunity is even possible, etc, with a virus so adapted to hitting ACE receptors.  It’s scary stuff, and so I say air on the side of caution.  Wear the mask until more is known.  I do it a bit for myself, and mostly to protect others (masks do more to protect others from you than to protect you from others)</p>

        <p>Masks aren’t that big of a deal to some people, but it is literally torture to people who cannot wear them medically. So yes for you, it’s not that big of a deal, but for others it is.</p>
<p>And the science behind its efficacy is specious at best. Every RCT ever done on masks shows them to be ineffective to stopping respiratory viral spread. Plus the data does not support it — places with nearly 100% compliance still see high transmission rates as compared to places with low compliance. Besides, wearing them in a sterilized environment like the OR is VERY different than wearing it throughout your daily life.</p>
<p>If you choose to wear a mask, great. But a policy that requires 100% compliance 100% of the time is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>I know your an Anesthesia guy but you have to understand you were trained to wear and dispose of mask properly. For the majority of the public this is new territory. I hardly see anyone wearing theirs properly. I don't wear one myself since it is utterly ridiculous and outside of a clinical setting useless. My mother works at a hospital and she pointed out doctors don't walk around wearing mask all day they only wear them briefly or for short periods of time in certain situations and they dispose of them immediately afterwards. </p>
<p>You have people out here wearing these things for 8 hours straight and reusing the same one for days on end. There is no way in hell that is healthy or harmless. I hate the argument mask don't protect you they protect others. If that's the case if everyone wore a mask no one would be protected so those bitching about 100% compliance are ignoring the contradiction. Not to mention Lord Fauci (PBUH) said asymptomatic spread is extremely rare, yet that is the argument for a seemingly perfectly healthy person to wear a mask to prevent asymptomatic transmission. All this is theater and quite stupid when you put all the pro mask and pro lockdown reasons together. The truth is linear, the covid 19 narrative is all over the place. It's time to call this what it is....a big fucking joke.</p>

        <p>Your logic does not follow.</p>
<p>Look at the Asian countries with high compliance.  They work, and they don’t need a lockdown (with masks).</p>
<p>We’ve worn them for decades in ORs to protect people, not ourselves.  So if everyone wore masks, each person protects all others from their own droplets.  It’s how this works, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>You can cherry pick evidence all you want.  Just because something is published in a peer-reviewed journal does not mean it’s credible, fact, or gospel.  Ask any doctor, they’ll read the study, compare it to others, look at the scope, method, sample size, etc.</p>
<p>So, those articles stand contrary to the mountain of evidence that support mask use.  And remember, most health professionals look at things in terms of risk/benefit analysis.  With masks, so long as there is maintained diligence, there’s really no risk.</p>
<p>I’m not doom and gloom.  What I am is careful.  I want this gone, tired of wearing a mask everywhere.  But as long as there’s so many questions, so much unknown about the future, about long term effects, I’ll do my part and try to keep others safe, from ME, by wearing the mask.</p>
<p>My hopes are by mid 2021 we’ll see the light at the end of this dark tunnel.  I don’t want this any more than you guys do.  The difference is I have the humility to say to you I don’t know what the hell is going on, so I will choose to be safe, and wear a mask for that reason.</p>

        <p>Lol, cherry picking? Here is a pro mask articles from mainstream sources.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>What I find worrisome is this statement near the end of this same article:</p>
<p>"<em>It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools,</em> <strong><em>they are also talismans</em></strong> <em>that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals.</em> <strong><em>Although such reactions may not be strictly logical,</em></strong> <em>we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis."</em></p>
<p>I want evidence and proof that these provide actual protection, but the fact that this journal tries to put a positive spin that these are mostly talismans and mask wearing is merely symbolic really is disturbing. In fact I've read more pro mask studies and journals than you may care to know but they all say the same  thing that they are <strong><em>likely</em></strong> to provide protection and <strong><em>may</em></strong> reduce the spread but that isn't enough for me at least.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions#:~:text=Airborne%20transmission%20is%20defined%20as,long%20distances%20and%20time">WHO</a> : "<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols</em></strong>*.(13-16) These* <strong><em>theories</em></strong> <strong><em>suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person are</em> <strong><em>not known</em></strong>*, <em>but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"*</em></p>
<p>Interestingly the end of the next paragraph reveals : "<em>To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route</em> <strong><em>has not been demonstrated</em></strong>*; <em>much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission.*"</em></p>
<p>Then there is this study done by the CDC itself. <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/12/cdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks/">10/12/2020 CDC Study Finds Overwhelming Majority Of People Getting Coronavirus Wore Masks</a></p>
<p>What is particularly unsettling for me is the inconsistency of the health authorities especially when CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield makes statements like this: </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1306257291726016514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1306257291726016514%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthefederalist.com%2F2020%2F10%2F12%2Fcdc-study-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-people-getting-coronavirus-wore-masks%2F">"This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine."</a>  </p>
<p>This begs the question: Why are we rushing to get a vaccine at all if this is the case?</p>
<p>Personally I find it ridiculous but I also have to consider it might possibly accurate since <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/10/27/covid-vaccine-trials.aspx?cid_source=dnl&amp;cid_medium=email&amp;cid_content=art1HL&amp;cid=20201027Z1&amp;mid=DM692979&amp;rid=997282959&amp;fbclid=IwAR1lmKUik66ru-vuyynFO59YVmnRs_gNbGmzi8tlukH7Ha0dE180asCDShI">the only criterion for a successful COVID-19 vaccine is a reduction of symptoms shared by both COVID-19 and the common cold</a>.</p>
<p>As far as your statement:</p>
<p><em>"Look at the Asian countries with high compliance. They work, and they don’t need a lockdown (with masks)."</em></p>
<p>I do find it interesting that you mentioned the Asian countries and yet here in the States mask compliance is actually quite high upwards of 85% and yet we constantly hear of cases rising. So? What gives? Maybe these can explain:</p>

        <p>Masks - not for everyday use. They have some limited utility <em>If</em> you're in a high-exposure situation, like if you're taking care of a sick patient who's coughing right near you, or you're very vulnerable to infections and easily get sick from low viral loads most people can fight off, <em>and</em> it's an n95. Or if you're sick yourself and you MUST go out, then a fresh medical mask and/or shield can somewhat reduce how many droplets you're spraying onto things when you cough and sneeze - it's probably not entirely useless. Cloth is permeable and risks aerosolizing droplets. Aerosols stay in the air a long time and travel much further than droplets. So what I think is cloth is useless at best and possibly worse than nothing, medical masks are of low but not zero value if you're sick and pretty much zero if you're not, n95s are a good choice for people treating sick patients and people who are immunocompromised and can't self-isolate but they're definitely not some magical protection against viruses; they reduce the chance you'll get sick but it can still happen.</p>
<p>Lockdown - The overall harms greatly outweigh the limited benefits and this kind of authoritarianism is never okay. The First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of assembly and peaceful protest (redress of grievances), doesn't have an exception says "unless your governor feels nervous about something." It interferes with herd immunity, which is the only way out unless you're a tiny country who can completely seal your borders for an extended period of time (years) and don't already have significant community spread. Lockdowns cause poverty, which can be deadly - more dangerous than the virus for most people, and will make you more susceptible to infection through bad nutrition, bad sleep, and so on. When I was poor I couldn't even afford enough calories to maintain a normal weight, my work put me in contact with hundreds of people a day, and sleep quality was very bad. My immunity was likely worse than it is now and it took a little longer to get over colds - still not by that much, because I was otherwise healthy and in my 30s, but imagine if that person is 63.</p>
<p>The data does not support the virus being deadly or severe for <em>most</em> people, and the vast majority of the people who are in danger are easily identified: they're elderly or they have certain severe, chronic health problems. If <em>they</em> are strongly urged but not forced to stay home as much as possible and take precautions when out, and we support health care workers with as much PPE as they want and need, then mandates add very little benefit and a lot of harm, and we're better off without them.</p>
