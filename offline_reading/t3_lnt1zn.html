        <p>This is my first time posting here, but due to my parents’ experience, I find myself firmly in this camp now.  I have never, <em>never</em> heard both my parents tell me that they felt like they were going to die.  They’re slowly on the mend now, but I have been so stressed &amp; so scared for them this past week that it has affected my health as well.</p>

        <p>Here is the transcript of what she wrote:</p>
<p>I am posting this purely as personal testimony. I am neither advocating for or against Covid vaccinations. Every individual should make up their own mind whether to get it or not. 
My husband &amp; I decided to get the MODERNA COVID 19 vaccine at publix last Tuesday, February 9th.  We did not go at the same time, but we went on the same day. Neither of us was sick at the time we were inoculated.  By that evening we were starting to feel unwell with a bit of low grade fever, chills, and I was developing a bit of a cough.  Several hours later, I had some itchy welts on my torso as well. By the following day, my cough was persistent, the chills, fever &amp; body aches sent me to the couch with Tylenol &amp; Gatorade. My husband also displayed with fever, chills, body aches, but in addition developed a bad taste in his mouth to the extent of feeling nauseated. He went to bed. 
We had heard the first dose didn’t bother people very much, but the second left them with mild symptoms of discomfort. In our case, we thought the side effects we were experiencing probably were a little stronger than the norm, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
However, by the end of that day, I had a migraine that would have dropped a whole army to its knees. This stayed with me for the next five days! The cough got worse!!!
Meanwhile, My husband was having severe difficulty keeping fluids &amp; food down. His gut was inflamed and nothing stayed in his system. He started to get very dehydrated &amp; his pulse ox fell into the high eighties, low nineties range.
On our first trip to the doctor’s office he immediately gave me a steroid injection to help me breathe. He ordered us both to have the Covid antibodies blood test &amp; sent me for a chest X-ray.  I came home with a daily dose of steroids, the opiate version of Robitusson 
cough medication, &amp; an antibiotic. 
The blood test showed neither one of us have Covid!!! The X-ray showed that I have pleural thickening or scarring. (I will have a CT scan next week to further evaluate).  My husband has lost twelve pounds! I have only lost five!
We go back to the doctor first thing Monday morning for his x-ray results, and a reevaluation of us both. God willing, we will both be on the upside of this nightmare by then. 
According to the CDC over one thousand people have died after receiving the vaccine, however they have yet to recognize a correlation between receiving the vaccine &amp; death. Keep in mind these drug companies have received full immunity &amp; are not subject to being sued for death or damages.
But if you have personally experienced ill health following severe allergic reaction to the Covid vaccination, you really should report your experience. The packet you received after the first injection has instructions on how to report adverse reactions as well as the vial lot number.  The FDA/CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) toll free number is
1-800-822-7967. 
You can also report side effects to Mderna TX, Inc at 1-866-663-3762.:angry:</p>
