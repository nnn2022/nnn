        <p>12 positive. 2 were sick for a day. No deaths. <em>(I have dozens of stories from actual doctors and nurses through)</em></p>
<p>My friend's mother runs the Covid Floor of a major Mid-Atlantic Hospital that is in between 2 counties totalling 200,000 people. The floor is empty everyday, has been empty everyday since January and the 2 counties together have &lt;50 Covid deaths. </p>
<p>I used to work in a laboratory and a hospital, serving different roles, and thus have many friends in the industry, as well as family. None of the people I talk to with healthcare experience are getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Even through MSM BS, they can't deny that <strong>a majority</strong> of healthcare workers still refuse to vaccinate... and they have the most intimate knowledge about it...</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve known co-workers (globally) and neighbors who have tested positive - probably 20 or so. No serious cases, lots of headaches. </p>
<p>A sample:
1. My electrician is retired, does odd jobs. He‚Äôs a big guy, got it early - was pissed he couldn‚Äôt taste his beer. 
2. My 92 year old relative got it, he‚Äôs frail, but what do you do, he‚Äôs 92. His care facility checked him into the hospital, he was fine. Doing great. His 91 year old wife lives with him - didn‚Äôt catch it.
3. My other relative, 78, bed-bound, asthmatic. Tested positive along with her care facility roomie, 92. No symptoms in either aside from mild fever.
4. Friend‚Äôs dad, diabetic (type 2) and dementia. Tested positive, fever. Still kicking.</p>
<p>I enjoy this topic because, anecdotally, the entire thing seems so hard to grasp. I ask folks in groups (gasp! Gatherings!) all the time and it‚Äôs always similar. Someone in the group can usually dig up 1 person - most likely a mother of a friend of a friend or something - who had terminal cancer and ‚Äúdied of covid.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I know a lot of people in 2 countries: </p>
<p>South Africa where I lived for 42 years (all my extended family, in-laws and friends live there still) and Canada where my husband, child and I have been living for 2 and a half years. So I'll split it into countries!</p>
<p>South Africa: 
4 positive </p>
<p>My uncle who is over 70 got it and then ended up in hospital with pneumonia for a week. He's fine now)</p>
<p>Friend - 44yrs old got it and had mild symptoms. Stayed home until she was better.</p>
<p>Same friend's mom - late 60s - pneumonia and hospital for a week. On oxygen but not ventilator. She's fine now.</p>
<p>Friend - early 40s - pharmacist - obviously in contact with a lot of sick people often - severe sinus issues and overweight - got it badly and was in hospital for weeks, maybe even a month? Can't remember exact time. On oxygen and then later ventilated. Recovered and is fine now.</p>
<p>No deaths.</p>
<p>Canada: husband's co-worker's husband (60s) tested positive. Stayed home. Is fine now.</p>
<p>Don't know any one else or know of anyone who has died.</p>

        <p>At least 3 people still in my mom's household (of 5) had it, just like a bad cold, and no after-effects. One of my husband's coworkers had it, not sure how severe, but he came back to work and was fine after his quarantine period. I know of two older people (one a grandparent of a former coworker, one an inlaw of my extended family) who both died from it, but they both had many preexisting health problems (my coworker said he was expecting his grandad to be in his last year or so even before covid came around). I know of one friend from church who had it early on and didn't know until she was tested for antibodies, and she said she still has shortness of breath and chest pain occasionally. She's in her 50s. I know a bunch of other people from my church had it, because they had to quarantine and tell everyone they'd been hanging out with, but not sure of the number, and none of them died. </p>
<p>So between 10 - 20 acquaintances whove had it, only two that died, one with lasting effects.</p>
