    <strong>My brother is usually pro-vax and actually qualified to make a decision on that and even he isn't making me get the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>My brother is legit smart as fuck. He's got a degree in biomedical sciences and a masters in something wild specific so I don't really wanna say exactly what for privacy reasons. He's got a couple other qualifications and his job is pretty research focused. Before the pandemic he was about to start working towards a PhD so the point is he really knows his shit and he's good at it. He keeps up with and contributes to research journals through his work and shit and understands them in a way I legit never will. </p>
<p>But this whole situation has kinda fucking sucked with him to be real. He's my legal guardian and he forced the mask thing on me pretty early even though we live in a country where it never fully took off. Same with sanitising everything and keeping a distance and isolating if you get even a small cough or some shit. He doesn't support mass lockdowns and he's kinda on the fence about masks now after more research has come out so he isn't totally lost to this shit but he's in pretty deep.</p>
<p>Anyway he got vaccinated the second it was an option and we argued about it then. But even if I'm worried about him the freedom to choose should go both ways so he can take the risk if he wants to. Recently they made it so we can get the vaccine in my age group now and I kinda thought he'd tell me to get it but the more stories that come out about side effects for young people the more he talks about how dumb it is to take that risk. He says he wouldn't use me as an experiment for anything in the world because my age group is at a low risk and he thinks the risks of the vaccine for my age group are worse than any potential benefit. </p>
<p>And this shit comes from someone who goes hard for the propaganda. This is someone with all the qualifications pro vaxxers are fucking obsessed with. Seeing as boys in the 16-17 age group are more likely to develop heart problems which got <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2783052?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2021.3471">confirmed toda</a>y just keep fucking resisting. You're not gonna see most qualified people in the media saying this shit. They've all been bought out. My brother is just a fucking guy who actually uses his education to think critically at least some of the time. He doesn't have any kinda agenda and his only agenda is keeping me safe. If he wouldn't make me get the vaccine then it isn't fucking safe straight up.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah he's the best honestly. He isn't perfect and he has a lot of health anxiety so he falls for a lot of propaganda but when it comes down to actual serious shit he'd never take that kinda risk for me.</p>

        <p>He did right by protecting you from COVID because we don't know about the long term effects (e.g. chicken pox can later cause shingles).  He did right by protecting you from an experimental gene therapy not approved by the FDA because we don't know the long term effects (see the animal studies of the previous coronavirus vaccine tests and their long term effects).</p>

        <p>Yeah for sure. I've had a lot of vaccines when I was a kid because there are like decades of research to support that they're safe and effective and shit so he's definitely not even anti vax.</p>
