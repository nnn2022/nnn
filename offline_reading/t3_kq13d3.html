        <p>I'm sorry but I don't care to know each individual who has died "from covid". The virus has a 99% survival rate. Anyway I highly doubt covid was the cause</p>

        <p>I mean, covid is what finally killed him...</p>
<p>But covid did not fatten him up at least 100+ pounds above his healthy weight and cause his health to be on the brink in the first place...</p>

Flu and obesity don’t go together, either. 
I am sorry to hear he died though.</p>

<p>&rt; <em>this was definitely a reality check for me, I've been avoiding people like the plague but havent been getting enough exercise or vitamin d so id get hit pretty hard if I actually got it. Gonna change that today.</em></p>

        <p>Struggled to word this properly. </p>
<p>I actually knew this guy. He was a somewhat close friend to my wife and a well known and liked member of the cosplay/convention/gaming community. Real nice dude. He died of bacterial pneumonia brought on as a complication from covid. He was in the hospital for a couple weeks and was in high spirits the whole time. </p>
<p>Obviously there were significant factors to his death other than the hyperpoliticized virus, and anyone who says he died “from covid” isn’t really giving the whole picture. That may be out of ignorance, or they may be intentionally misleading, but either way I learned a strange lesson last night when my wife found out a friend of hers died early. I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and have been booted out of a few other subs for arguing against totalitarianism and efforts to control nature. I genuinely enjoy you guys and this is always a good refresher for me to escape the mass stupidity of the world today. But my lesson was this: when a death occurs close to you, it really isn’t about the cause. Or the shady folks fudging the numbers behind the scenes. It’s about the person and the life they left behind. Their family and friends. And that’s what I hope I can focus on (and I hope you guys don’t fall into the trap I did). I know we all like to shit talk the lockdowns and exercise our freedom was much as the government “allows” us to these days, and I’ll continue that fight til my dying breath. I just hope that we don’t become so abused by those in power that we start losing sight of death just because it was a death for stupid reasons. I realized I’d fallen prey to a big mind shift last night when I heard of Jarod’s death. I almost knee-jerk uttered “but what really killed him?” to my wife when she was holding back tears. Not the right reaction to have when a friend of mine dies, and I feel like that argumentative spirit was bred into me this past year, so just know that things are weird now. Death is sad, no matter the cause.</p>

        <p>Yes, death is tragic period, and I am sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, It is good you have not fallen for the alarmism.</p>
<p>And, if something like this were to strike me dead one day, I would hope my loved ones would not fall for the alarmism and push for it in my name either. I have always thought it would be an absolute disgrace if I died in a very rare school shooting and gun control advocates used my name and death to push for stupid shit like gun control, or my family took to blaming "guns" as the issue, and I am taking a largely similar approach to covid.</p>
<p>I would understand if this virus was something like the actual plague which can cause an agonizing death to almost anyone in large numbers, but for something this small in scope, the loss of liberty to such a degree is not justified.</p>

        <p>Thank you. 
Yeah, my wife and I were talking today and we saw that most people on social media briefly talk about Jarod and the life he lived, and then quickly pivot to a PSA about masks and distancing and lockdowns etc. Surprisingly few people didn’t mention covid at all. And we realized that they’re all on the crazy warm side, as we named it. Dismissing rationality in favor of total emotional appeasement. But we were in danger of being (unbeknownst to us) on the crazy cold side, where any death involving covid should be doubted or just lumped into the narrative of politicized. I was very close to dismissing emotion and sympathy in favor of rational resistance. Learned the hard way to see the middle ground when it comes to actual people and real deaths. 
It did bother us though how close people were coming to alarmism and virtue signaling though. Felt gross.</p>

        <p>Well, I mean, I can't say I agree with the people on this sub against the vaccine whatsoever or those pretending covid is a hoax, and I don't feel anti mask wearing is the hill to die on for "liberty" either.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I still genuinely believe the lockdowns have been worse than the virus. </p>
<p>I suppose my "middle ground" though is that I can at least understand supporting more prevention measures even if I do not, as I kinda see it as we are screwed either way, and as little humans we are powerless to stop it. We can just choose which is the best path; less dead old/sick people but years of depression for most of the rest of the population who also have limited lives, or people die but at least life does not stop for everyone else on account of them. Essentially, I don't think it actually matters which patch we choose as we are screwed either way, and it just comes down to which method of harm reduction you prefer for the most part.</p>
<p>And to be clear, the reason I find some death "acceptable" is because, quite simply, death is a theft of time. But, covid only steals time from the old/sick who's remaining time was already likely limited for the most part. But, the issue is, in trying to stop covid stealing time from those most vulnerable, we are demanding the 99% of the population unaffected sacrifice their own time to the lockdowns, and overall, if your goal is to minimize time lost, I don't think lockdowns work, as they collectively waste more time than the amount saved by preventing the deaths. If the virus was something more deadly and age agnostic like the plague, this assessment would be different though.</p>

        <p>ok, look at the guys computer, all the cans on the desk, and pretty much everything else.</p>

<p>This is 100% the stereotypical neckbeard who is pro mask, social distancing and supports amazon, and hates all proper things with a passion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I don't think COVID was the cause of death here....</p>

<p>I'll probably delete this later because i don't want to be harrassed by these people</p>
