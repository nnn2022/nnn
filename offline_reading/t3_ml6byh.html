    <strong>I don't know what to do anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I am in a situation where I can't decide my future in my country. Forced masks everywhere, you have to had app in your mobile that has your covid status and now the vaccine is going to be forced. 
I am in a strict company and for sure other company are same due to covid situation, so I can't quit for other company. 
The company most employees are always talking about taking the vaccine, and recently I come to know that the company want all employees to take it or end their contract. 
But since awhile I have been reading all what in here and other same reddit groups and I can't decide if I should take it to continue my work and not ruining my family, or had to be fined and maybe even jailed for refusing taking it? I can't have a medical exception since all medical and healthcare sectors are advising to take the vaccine and telling people it is just a vaccine, same as it is just a mask. </p>
<p>Sometimes I tell myself ignorance is a bless, because truth hurts.</p></p>

        <p>This is a choice that only you can make. You have to decide what is best for your family.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that jobs come and go. Government coercion and threats come and go, but you have a duty to your family that will never go away.</p>
<p>Don't make this decision based on money or fear, unless that fear is for the safety and happiness of your family.</p>
<p>Safety and happiness is not the same as amount of income. Maybe a different, if potentially lower-paying job could provide you more security if your family can manage it.</p>
<p>I have already resolved that if my employer begins requiring vaccination I will hand in my resignation with no hesitation or regret.</p>
<p>Talk to your wife and make this decision together. If she supports what you choose, do it without fear.</p>
<p>People in history have survived much worse odds with much less opportunity, and there's no reason to believe that you can't do the same.</p>

<p>Also you clean your guns, prepare your whip, or get your baseball bat ready for war. If it is peaceful good, we won. If it isn't then you are prepared and you didn't spend months or years worried about whether or not you could protect yourself against the brainwashed establishment.</p>

        <p>If you live in Israel, you need to find one of your own, like-minded people, gather &amp; find ways to flee out that fucking hellhole. I think I might know right person for you if you are truly Israeli. Imagine national exodus from Israel for sake of finding asylum ðŸ¤¦ It's gonna happen everywhere eventually.</p>

        <p>I don't have any personal ties with this person. Did you perhaps heard of  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/lz2qez/the_situation_in_israel_posting_this_screen/">Ilana Rachel</a>? Here's her interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMsn0bj_P6o&amp;t=841s&amp;ab_channel=BLCKBX">youtube video</a>. Try to get into contact with her. Also, are there still protesters on streets? Guys, gather &amp; make some sort of alliance or underground organization &amp; start making plans. Wish the best luck for you, this is the real 'we're in this together', you'll see population popping &amp; real estate business booming in Florida &amp; Texas &amp; won't be a coinkidink.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m a US citizen and have been heavily considering throwing my entire life away here and packing up the rest to go Florida. Although I think itâ€™s a short term type of security because the plan is going to roll full steam ahead, and the plan doesnâ€™t exclude any US state. I do know of Ilana and sheâ€™s doing great work. There are lots of protests here, continuously, but sadly they are only a drop in the ocean. No one cares. At all. Whatsoever. We are on our own here. Even those who agree still wear the masks and play into the insanity.</p>
