        <p>100% and even more, the CDC confirms that they haven't even proven that the virus exist yet, as it has not been isolated or met Koch's postulates so far.</p>

        <p>Who is up voting this shit? Guys, this poster is planted here to discredit the subreddit.</p>
<p>u/LuckyTomRZ, you are taking this quote out of context. The authors of this already dated paper were simply pointing out that they did not have a virus isolate with a known concentration at the time of their experiments, so they could not use it to calibrate their assay. It is not, I repeat, it is not admission nor evidence against the reality of the Corona virus.</p>
<p>I work in a virology lab and we have virus isolates, we have purified viral proteins and antibodies against them. Our collaborators culture the virus in cells in vitro. There is no doubt that SARS-CoV-2 exists. </p>
<p>Please stop with your crackpot conspiracy theories.</p>

        <p>Citation to what? It's in the article <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/LuckyTomRZ/">u/LuckyTomRZ</a> posted. I can no longer see his post, I've blocked him.</p>
<p>See below tons of citations about isolating and culturing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. </p>
<p>At this point, if one needs so badly a proof, one can order oligonucleotides and reagents, buy a simple second hand thermal cycler, some agarose and some DNA stain, and amplify the bloody thing themselves. The sequence has been publicly available since the start.</p>
<p>I hate the response to the pandemic as much as the next guy, but it doesn't help making shit up when there are thousands of people with resources and knowledge who would have died to prove the virus was a hoax.</p>

        <p>The primers in use are not from isolated and purified sars cov2. There was a great article from a bio chemist that compares the genomes and they were identical.  They are using the original sars primers and some others that exist in every human on earth chromosome 8 to name one. This is not an ad hom but you may not be able to see the forest through the trees</p>

        <p>I'm discrediting the subreddit by sharing official information disclosed by the CDC and the FDA?.... And I'm the crackpot conspiracy theorist? Really? Anyway...</p>
<p>Since you CLAIM to work in a virology lab and all that impossible to confirm crap, try leaving the ad hominem attacks for the dimwits. Lets end the debate, this should be super easy. </p>
<h1>I kindly ask you to please share the peer-reviewed scientific papers which proves that the controllavirus has met Koch's postulates.</h1>

        <p>I've been reading science articles related to the controllavirus scam since February. I know all of these, I've seen them and read them. I've been having this debate since then and so far no one could show me that scientific proof. </p>
<p>And, "lab guy", instead of asking me childish and useless questions, or talking about mods, <strong>if there is any section of this articles where it says that Koch's postulates have been met, please quote it and indicate where it is.</strong> </p>
<p>If you do it, you'll win this debate. But I guess not, seems like you prefer to go and hide in your hole. If you really work in a lab, I sincerely hope that you are not in charge of anything buddy, people's lives could be in danger. </p>

        <p>The panel doesn’t say it doesn’t meet the postulates, one reviewer said it technically doesn’t because the study animal was a mouse, thus it did not demonstrate that they caused the clinical disease (i.e., in humans). That same reviewer did not take issue with the isolation, purification and visualization components of the postulates being met. They even acknowledged the postulates would be met if the mouse were considered sufficient and if they could demonstrate immune response. After the authors did that, his only concern was that they don’t cite a source for the postulates.</p>
<p>The only relevant part of your link, in full:
&rt;    Although not very clearly indicated in the paper, the adapted postulates could be summarized as:</p>
<p>&rt;    1. isolation of virus from diseased hosts</p>
<p>&rt;    2. cultivation in host cells</p>
<p>&rt;    3. proof of filterability</p>
<p>&rt;    4. production of comparable disease in the original host species or a related one</p>
<p>&rt;    5. re-isolation of the virus</p>
<p>&rt;    6. detection of a specific immune response to the virus</p>
<p>&rt;    Although the house mouse is not very closely related to the human being (postulate 4), it is a mammal, and the authors do show a comparable disease (pneumonia) as seen in affected people
 (ground-glass opacities in the lung on CT scan, consistent with interstitial pneumonia). The authors also re-isolate the virus from lung tissue of the inoculated mice. Therefore, if the mouse is considered sufficiently related to the human being for the purposes of these postulates, they have fulfilled postulates 4 and 5 of above list. Postulates 1 to 3 have been reached by others prior to
 this study, and postulate 6 is not yet fulfilled.</p>
<p>The authors later go on to fulfill postulate 6 with an antibody test.</p>

        <p>I never said it was super dangerous and few people criticizing you outside coronvirusFOS even mentions any danger at all. And even those few people mentioned their patients or people they personally knew suffering from it, so they weren’t necessarily saying it’s “super dangerous.”</p>
<p>You might be surprised, but people can accept the virus is real without thinking it’s some huge danger that requires extreme government overreach. Although, I think I short-circuited your brain last time I said that, so I’m pretty sure you won’t respond to this either (or if you do, you’ll “blah blah” past this part).</p>

        <p><em>"The only relevant part of your link"</em>. It's the peer-review paper made by a panel of experts and you only select a few lines from it? By the way, those lines don't say what you think they are saying. It's the total opposite. Not even one of the experts supports the claim that they achieved to meet Koch's postulates. Another extracts from the PEER REVIEW papers:</p>
<p><strong><em>"While the authors conclude that the infected mice fulfill Koch’s postulates, the results really just show that hACE2 confers SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to mice, without mimicking human disease to a substantial extent."</em></strong></p>
<p>Not only they did't meet the postulates, but the whole experiment was wrong.</p>

        <p>It says exactly what I think it’s saying. What do you think it’s saying?</p>
<p>How come every article that cites this article and mentions Koch’s postulates refers to it as a demonstration that the postulates are met by covid? How come the reviewers accepted the author’s responses and modifications to the paper (that still say they showed covid fulfills the postulates) to be published in <strong>Nature</strong>, if they don’t think it was a valid conclusion? How come there isn’t a single, high-impact article criticizing the Koch postulate conclusion of the authors?</p>
<p>You are grasping at straws to be divisive, and it doesn’t work. You’re not intelligent, not a critical thinker and not anything other than rat.</p>

        <p><strong>It wasn't "PUBLISHED" in Nature, buddy.</strong></p>
<p>My good, you are really ECONOMICAL when it comes to science, you know. <strong>Nature has a database which collects studies, whether they are right or wrong, it's called a scientific library</strong>. There are thousands of those worldwide. Those libraries have great articles, but they are also full of crap, because they collect everything that resembles a scientific paper, whether it was made seriously or not.</p>
<p><strong>The only REAL VALIDATION there is in science is the PEER-REVIEW process, which this article you shared FAILED tremendously to accomplish.</strong></p>

        <p>Back to this argument? It was published in Nature, and it passed peer review. You can see in the link I sent it says “Published: 07 May 2020.” Published. It was “Accepted 24 April 2020”. Accepted after Peer Review.</p>
<p>It was previous deposited in medrxiv, which was not peer reviewed, but the peer reviewed version was the one published by Nature.</p>
<p>Nature does not publish articles without those passing peer review, unlike medrxiv. Here’s proof:</p>

        <p>Bless your heart Dacsy, I know you're doing the best you can... this must be as good as it gets with you. Look, you have two hands and internet, put "Koch's postulates" in <a href="https://google.com">google.com</a> and click on search. Good luck.</p>

        <p>There is a difference in shortening something for better understanding or leaving out information that changes the whole meaning of your quote and you did the latter.
Also, since for some reason all you care about is Koch's postulates to proof Covid-19 is real (also, if you think it is all fake and some organization is trying to deceive you, don't you think they would just fake a study, saying it is fulfilled?), but I do not know what version of his postulates you would like to see fulfilled, probably the one it won't, to fit your narrative. But here you go, press CTRL-F and enter Koch to skip everything but that trivial detail.

<p><strong>First of all, that study it's NOT PEER-REVIEWED.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Second, it's a study on hamsters.</strong> If they managed to met Koch's postulates on hamsters, they should do it instantaneously on humans. Where is that breakthrough study which would have made these chinese scientist millionaires?</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly, the article was published on March 2020, and the study was supposed to have taken place in January 2020.</strong> So you actually believe the Chinese had the virus met Koch' postulates 11 months ago, which is frankly ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth, it is a Chinese study.</strong> The Chinese have been sending lie after lie during these whole months.</p>
<p>Therefore, even when it was a study on hamsters, <strong>since this article has not been PEER-REVIEWED (and they had 10 months to review it), it cannot be validated.</strong> The fact that no one wanted to review it gives you a sign how full of crap it is.</p>

        <p>I’m with you on the postulates. The issue may arise from a more astute argument that kochs postulates do not apply to viruses the majority of the time. I believe you must put it in context to creating primers for the rt qpcr’s being used to push the narrative. I’ve reached out to dr Kaufman to get clarification but have yet to get a response. I’ve also become aware they used the same technique for the first sars back years ago. It also never truly satisfied the postulates. This is all very confusing water to tread in and folks using this to usher in top down control know this. Let me know what you find</p>

        <p>The problem, my friend, is not the postulates. <strong>That is one, only one, of the THOUSANDS contradictions and lies the government and the media have been telling us all this time.</strong> They haven't stopped. Lie after lie. Everything we are being told is a cover up. Every dissident voice has been censored. They are even putting people in jail for Facebook posts. <strong>When you add up all the lose ends, there is no choice, you realize this is HOAX.</strong> Unless you believe that all this oppression system they are unrolling is something they invented after the controllavirus showed up. <strong>Impossible, this has been planned for decades.</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>HOAX</strong> is a <strong>HOAX</strong>, from its beginning to its end. There is no middle ground in hoaxes, because the sightliest piece of truth can bring the castle down. Even in the smallest details, truth has to be hidden or distorted. If they convince you, they succeeded. If they can't, at least they want you to be confused. That is what this is all about.</p>
<p>Since you claim to have looked into this issue, <strong>don't you find strange that there are hundreds of scientific papers talking about "the virus being isolated", when the reality is that they were "isolating" RNA genetic residue which they assume that belongs to the virus?</strong> The word "isolate" is a strong word in the scientific community and, since this all started, they have been using it recklessly, all the time.  This is a clear indication that their aim is to confuse, it is a very clear objective they have. And when you add up the whole picture, it is quite clear: <strong>there is absolutely no intention of honesty coming from the government, the media or the mainstream science in charge of this all. They are just pushing lie after lie. On purpose.</strong></p>

        <p>For some reason I'm writing you comments, but I can't see them or yours.</p>
<p>I read in my message box that you told me to check on River's postulates. Yes, I know them and also Evans later. <strong>Rivers initiated a long list of</strong> <strong><em>"revisions"</em></strong> <strong>that the medical science pushed. Rivers used to say that</strong> <strong><em>"Koch's postulates were not postulates, that they were obstacles"</em></strong><strong>.</strong>  Quite a phrase. Rivers loved to say awful stuff about Koch and the people who treasured his postulates.</p>
<p>The medical science has been pushing to flexibilize their controls for over 50 years now. Today we see the consequences of that: <strong>people investigating viruses which can't be confirmed to exists in the first place.</strong></p>

        <p>I wrote you a response and it seems to have dissapeared.. Ok, again. </p>
<p>I'm super calmed down, all good with you really. I avoided the topic you arose because is a technicality and sometimes, by focusing on a technicality, we lose the big picture: <strong>a hoax is a hoax from its beginning to its end.</strong> <em>"The truth is treason in the empire of lies."</em></p>
<p>Basically what I was telling you is that we can focus all you want on the postulates' exceptions, but is a complex issue. <strong>It depends if we are talking of microorganism or viruses. It depends on which postulate we are focusing on and how we approach it.</strong> I mean, delving in this can even make you question the existence of virus in general, it's a tricky conversation. </p>
<p><strong>The fact is that the Koch's postulates are STILL the gold standard criteria when it comes to confirm the existence of a virus.</strong> If an alleged virus (theory) doesn't pass the postulates' tests, it objectively means that its existence hasn't been scientifically confirmed. Yes, definitely some things have been <em>"accepted"</em> without fulfilling Koch's postulates, but they have been <em>"accepted"</em>, <strong>they were not scientifically validated</strong>. Two very different things. </p>
<p>There is a lot of money and power involved in the medical sciences. Laboratories are, by far, the biggest lobby in the planet. Due to this, <strong>the medical science has pushed some of the barrier of those exceptions throughout time. The case of HIV/AIDS is the best example of how far they can go.</strong> But again, the fact that a theory has been <em>"accepted"</em> by people in power, doesn't mean that it has been scientifically proven. </p>
<p><strong>Koch's postulates remain as the gold standard criteria to prove the existence of a virus. There is nothing that comes even close to it. If a theory can't fulfill them, then it couldn't be proven, disregarding of who</strong> <strong><em>"accepts"</em></strong> <strong>what.</strong></p>

<p>I avoided your point regarding the postulates because it's quite a controversial point, it really has many ways to be looked at. From my perspective, those exceptions could have certain validity when it comes to microorganisms, but <strong>viruses are a different thing</strong>. It also depends on which postulate we are talking about and how we approach it. You are talking about the exceptions to Koch’s postulates.</p>
<p>The medical industry has definitely pushed some of the barriers of these exception, there is a lot of money and power involved in medical science. But if you want to delve in the exceptions, then we could even get to the point of questioning the actual existence of viruses. Quite complex.</p>
<p>The reality is that today, <strong>Koch's postulates are still recognized as the gold standard criteria to confirm the existence of a virus</strong>. <strong>There is no other thing that gets even close to it.</strong> If a virus cannot pass the Koch's postulates test, even though it can be <em>"recognized"</em> or <em>"accepted"</em> (depending by who, of course), <strong>it still is scientifically unproven</strong>. One thing is that a few people in power, financed by laboratories, decide to <em>"accept"</em> or <em>"validate"</em> a theory for a particular interest. Another thing is to prove that theory scientifically.</p>
<p>I avoided this topic for the reasons I described above. It's just a technicality, and sometimes focusing on technicalities makes us forget about the big picture: <strong>a Hoax is a Hoax, from its beginning to its end.</strong></p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>

        <p>Huh I think that just means something like there’s not a single gold standard stock yet for assay development. There are “gold standard” quantified substances for basically anything related to humans that you’d want to test in a lab. E.g urine with specific gravity exactly 1.00115.  Not gonna bother reading more, but yeah.</p>

        <p>There is not, because the virus has not met Koch's postulates so far. I've been looking to something to confirm that for months now and I never found it. If you know it, please share it. </p>
<p>And look, to be honest with you, if someone really managed to make the virus meet Koch's postulates (which is the gold standard to confirm the virus existence) it would have been major news all over the world and the researchers would have received the Nobel Prize already. It clearly didn't happen.</p>

        <p>I'm not attempting anything, I just shared <strong>OFFICIAL INFORMATION</strong> published by the CDC and the FDA which indicates that <strong>the virus has not met Koch's postulates so far</strong>. Probably you don't know, but Koch's postulates are the GOLD STANDARD criteria to confirm the existence of infectious diseases. My aim is that people is informed, then everyone can make up their own mind. </p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion of those subreddits, but <strong>I tend not to believe simple words written in the internet.</strong> Plus, I'm quite aware of how reddit works and how admins love to manipulate the narratives with multi-accounts and all. <strong>I require evidence to believe in things that someone is telling me, particularly filmography evidence.</strong> </p>
<p>That is why I want to tell you that you are also free to go into twitter and make a research on <strong>the</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/filmyourhospital?f=live"><strong>#filmyourhospital</strong></a> <strong>movement</strong>. Thousands of videos recorded by regular citizens showing empty hospitals, ambulances permanently parked and nurses dancing for tik tok videos during the peak of the "pandemic".</p>

        <p>&rt; I require evidence to believe in things that someone is telling me, particularly film/photographic evidence.</p>
<p>Quit flattering yourself, no humans require evidence to believe in things, we all have our biases and clearly you just can't see your own yet.  </p>
<p>&rt; I tend not to believe simple words written in the internet.</p>
<p>It would be a non-trivial piece of work to completely fabricate /r/medicine and /r/nursing along with everything else. My own biases which are somewhat based on my immersion in tech suggest that your theory is far less plausible than the prevailing one.  </p>
<p>IMO you're just attempting to justify going against the prevailing opinion by believing the virus is fake, this is to avoid an inner conflict in your mind about the guilt you otherwise might feel about going against the social virus consensus. Alternatively this is just some in/out group shit where there's a bunch of people you hate that believe deeply in the virus and you want to distance yourself from them but IMO that's where the guilt starts to creep in. </p>
<p><strong>There's nothing wrong about not believing in the lockdown</strong> <em>or disagreeing with how it is implemented</em> but to believe that the virus is fake at this stage (even the chief sceptic, the POTUS admitted to having it) is just jumping the shark.</p>

        <p>Buddy, hold your horses. How taught you how to read? Stevie Wonder?... <strong>I haven't given any theory AT ALL in my comments, I'm just sharing information and arguments for people to read and make their own mind</strong>. At no point I said that the virus doesn't exist, I just share the official information that <strong>science has not been able to prove it's existence yet</strong>. Maybe it will, I don't know.

<p>I don't hate anyone, I don't feel any guilt at all, and my aim here is just to share information and arguments which are relevant in my opinion. <strong>Apparently, you don't like information and arguments that don't fit your narrative</strong>, it seems like you prefer to close your mind and believe in stuff with no evidence, like an obedient, compliant and mindless bot. Knock yourself out, see if I care...</p>
<p>Maybe, due to the fact that the information and arguments I shared are quite compelling and you can't refute them, you feel like I'm trying to impose an idea on you, but I'm not. Don't trigger this much, Karen. Chill.</p>

<p>It means you have an axe to grind. You're <em>really</em> into this. That makes you a much less reliable source of information. You're basically a salesman for your philosophy, an evangelist without a crowd. This isn't a "strange set of logics", this is basic human psychology.   </p>

        <p>&rt; Your comment: 0% ARGUMENTS - 100% AD HOMINEM ATTACKS</p>
<p>Only somewhat, I have made a few points as we've gone that you're uninterested in picking up on because they don't further your cause.  </p>
<p>To re-iterate: I remain of the opinion that to falsify both /r/medicine and /r/nursing is a non-trivial operation that is hard to maintain and the secret is hard to keep. Furthermore the initial sceptic in the public light: the POTUS has caught COVID-19 and has recovered. What sequence of events both explains his initial scepticism and his catching of the virus if the virus is fake? I'm sure you have an explanation, I just don't see that explanation as particularly likely against COVID-19 being real and the President catching it and recovering.   </p>
<p>Anyway the arguments are kind of moot because like I said in the first place, I don't believe this discussion is about the facts. I believe, even if I could slap down 100% genuine irrefutable factual content you'd still find a means to disagree. That's because you're not interested in the facts of the matter, you're interested in warping reality to ensure you don't feel bad/feel better about something that you're not discussing. I do not have access to that information so everything we say is kind of pointless, its up to you to solve this riddle by yourself because it is of your own creation.  </p>
<p>You have a problem, the symptom of this problem is <strong>strongly</strong> believing very limp evidence that COVID-19 isn't real (to the extent of all your comment history). You should try to figure out what that problem is because leaving it open may hurt you in more ways than just this minor disagreement we're having.</p>

        <p>Guns aren't even needed. Aside from the 4th amendment, if the Christmas gathering is for the family to protest random "local law xyz", the 1st amendment protects it. The Bill of Rights is pretty damn nice. We take it for granted. This kind draconian measure would be almost impossible to pull off in the US on a legal level.</p>

        <p>It makes my blood boil to read things like this. we are we going to rise up for our rights? have humans become too docile over the years? It seems to me that very soon we are going to have to make choice to fight or just surrender everything and resign ourselves to a life of  the black mirror episode "Fifteen Million Merits." it is no longer enough for us to protest anonymously in silence</p>

        <p>This is just The Daily Mail selling copy via being spooky, they do this shit all the time (this is an old device from even back when I was a paper boy delivering this crap back in the 90s).<br>
They might break up something particularly big and loud (e.g. a street celebration) but there's no way in hell the average British police officer is going to break into an average home to enforce this policy, there's no way they're going to sneak about enough to even discover the breaking of policy. They'll just clip the biggest and most obvious.    </p>
<p>The worst shit that has happened thus far is people getting fined £10k for putting on a big (hundreds) house parties during the pandemic.</p>

        <p>No what you need to do is practice some critical thinking skills of your own and realize when government overreach is happening right in front of you. Where does this end? 2 weeks to “flatten the curve” 8 months ago is turning into police forcing their way into your private home to break up a Christmas party. If you can’t see what’s wrong with that, then I guess there’s no hope for people like you. For fucks sake, wake the fuck up.</p>
