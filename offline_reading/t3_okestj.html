    <strong>Report from Sweden</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Sweden and here we haven’t had any lockdown. No being forced to wear a mask either. Some people wear masks obviously but most don’t. We have had some restrictions regarding crowd sizes and restaurants had to close early for a while and could only seat 4 at each table but even that is gone now or at least changed to 8 people per table and normal opening hours.</p>
<p>Still, the societal pressure to take the vaccine is huge. Apparently they have buses outside supermarkets now, stopping people about to go inside to question them if they have taken the vaccine. Being sceptical towards the vaccine is a big no no and people will see you as a weird conspiracy theorist and/or a selfish asshole if you don’t want to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>I assume more people than me are sceptical but people are scared to speaking up because of how you will be viewed.</p>
<p>I read about what’s going on in other countries, like France, and it freaks me out. It’s insane. I believe it’s spreading and more and more countries will enforce harsh restrictions for anyone not vaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>I have a friend from Sweden and she's told me a lot of lies about the situation over there. </p>
<p>According to her, there are travel restrictions in place that have prevented her from travelling from Stockholm to Malmö to visit her parents for over a year. - I have found out that this is a complete lie and there are no travel restrictions within the country. </p>
<p>She claims to know 'hundreds' of people who have caught COVID and recovered, including herself. They all described it as a bad cold/flu. None of the 'hundreds' she knows have died. She claims that only one of those has permanent damage caused by COVID. That person is her boyfriend. She claims his lungs are permanently damaged because of COVID. However, he recovered from lung cancer in 2019 and started smoking again in 2020. It should be pretty obvious why his lungs are damaged, but she denies that this is even a possibility and says it is 100% COVID's fault. </p>
<p>She claims that the narrative in Sweden isn't that COVID is a deadly disease that kills people, but the main focus by the media has been on long COVID. Is there any truth to this? </p>
<p>Despite knowing 'hundreds' of people who have recovered from COVID and only one of those people allegedly having permanent damage, she claims that the number of people who get permanent damage from the disease is over 50% (to be specific, she said that MOST people who recover from COVID have long term damage).</p>
<p>She claims that there is NO vaccine push whatsoever in the country and claims that the MSM regularly feature debates on TV between those who are for restrictions and against restrictions. She claims that both sides get equal air time and there is no stigma if somebody is opposed to the restrictions. I'm guessing that her claims here are also completely fabricated?</p>

        <p>I DO know a lot of people who have recovered, myself included, but I don’t know anyone with long term damage. I myself didn’t even have a fever but I WILL say that it didn’t feel like a normal cold, mainly because I had pain in my heart. I even felt pain in my heart when working out after being well for 1 week which I’ve never experienced before even though I’ve had the flu and obviously many colds. BUT today I am fully recovered, I work out with no issues at all. And no one I know who has had it has any issues today because of it.</p>
<p>There have been no travel restrictions. There have been “recommendations” maybe that’s what she’s talking about, but everyone has been able to travel freely within the country.</p>
<p>I think that compared to many other countries there isn’t as much of a vaccine push, but there is definitely a vaccine push I would say, but there isn’t talk about “we have to get vaccinated to get back to normal” since we live pretty normal already. But in the Swedish culture and mentality it is important to stick together and help each other, we are a socialist country, and so it’s really frowned upon to not take the vaccine among the people at least. And it is VERY pushed in media that anti the vaccine = anti-vaxx, which is “misinformation”, misguided people, conspiracy theorists and so on.</p>
<p>Pro and against restrictions maybe get equal air time in the media, but definitely NOT pro and against the vaccine. There is only one possible opinion there which is pro vaccine.</p>

        <p>I think there's a good chance that she may have misunderstood recommendations as laws. She didn't even realise that Pfizer and Moderna have made a hell of a lot of money from the injections. She thought that, because people don't have to pay to be injected, they weren't making money. Somehow she didn't realise that the governments have paid for them using taxpayers' money...</p>
<p>Perhaps she's been a bit more extreme than most Swedes as she claimed that anybody who says that the PCR tests are flawed is a tin foil hat wearer. </p>
<p>I've noticed that a problem she has is that if somebody says ONE thing she disagrees with, then she considers EVERYTHING that person says to be incorrect. Because of this she is only taking in a limited amount of information. </p>
<p>I got her to watch a Ryan Cole video the other day. About five minutes in he mentioned that masks don't work. She stopped the video immediately and called him a liar and wouldn't watch any more. </p>
<p>She did something similar with a news article a while back. I can't remember what it was about now, but this particular article was 100% correct and was something that even the MSM had reported. However, the particular website I linked her to had apparently spread fake news at one point in the past,  which meant that the news story was fake. </p>
<p>She's actually pretty distrusting of the media in general and she knows that they lie a lot. At least that's her stance with other countries. For some reason she has complete trust in the Swedish media. </p>
<p>The craziest thing she's said so far was when I showed her the video of the CEO of the American Make a Wish Foundation saying that they wouldn't grant wishes for children whose families weren't vaccinated. I thought this could potentially win her round as I know her attitude towards children with terminal illnesses. However, she couldn't accept the possibility that the CEO of the Make a Wish Foundation could be so cruel and had to convince herself that the video was a deep fake...</p>

        <p>Why are they pushing for vaccines? Over 50% of Americans had Covid antibodies by March this year when only 13.7% had taken the vaccine. Sweden must have 60 to 70% of its population with Covid antibodies by now surely.</p>

        <p>That’s what’s so strange isn’t it. All over the world, why push THIS HEAVILY for a vaccine for a disease which isn’t THAT dangerous? A completely new vaccine which we don’t know long term complications for. Why THIS HEAVILY try to push everyone to take it? Do the world leaders really just care this much for “our health”? Really? Is that what they have shown us the years before?…something weird is definitely going on. :/</p>

        <p>I don't know the answer to this. But it is so extremely suspicious, that I consider it a big risk to do so.
I've heard two different conspiracy-theories, that both say it'll slowly kill you. One was about graphene-oxide, the other about an auto-immune-reaction against endothelial cells.
When I first heard them, I didn't consider them to have a high likelihood. But the more the vaccine is pushed, the more I fear there's something to it.</p>

        <p>Even if I trusted the covid vaccines, and I don't, I wouldn't take it on a fucking bus. I would schedule an appointment with my doctor. Thankfully my doctor isn't offering the covid-19 vaccines and told me not to get it.</p>
