        <p>The loudest voices supporting the lockdowns are urbanite 20-somethings who are probably estranged from their families (due to traumatic memories of things like being forced to attend church as children) and who are perfectly content spending all of their leisure time watching Netflix and playing video games. They don't give a shit that everything is locked down. They still have their WFH jobs and get GrubHub delivered nightly.</p>

        <p>It's both socially awkward basement dwellers, but it is also mostly people with very cushy upper middle class lives that have been collecting their full paychecks while sitting at home. This is why urban liberals are the biggest LARPers and virtue signalers for this "pandemic". These people are willing to give the things they loved to do, such as going to all their exclusive restaurants and clubs they used to go to, just so they can feel like "heroes" making a "sacrifice". At the same time, they scapegoat and blame others because they do miss their old lifestyle but have no understand of any basic science or even common sense. This is why they bleat on all the time about "it would have been over already if we had locked down right and if people had done what they were told, antimaskers like you are the reason this is still going on". These people are the most ignorant and out-of-touch I've ever seen.</p>

        <p>To say nothing of the fact that they can't seem to reconcile the notion that their cushy lifestyles are built on the backs of the people who are still out there, working their asses off so that <em>they can actually stay home</em>.</p>
<p>Seriously, where do you think the food in your pantry comes from?  </p>
<p>How do you think the water, electricity and gas works?  </p>
<p>You think those can be neglected?</p>

        <p>They must have a preschool understanding of the world...they know nothing of how society actually works. It's highly infuriating (and bizarre) how they actually believe that everyone can just stay home like them...when millions of workers have to work every single day just for society to keep functioning. It's also very telling about how "dangerous and deadly" this "pandemic" is...if it was truly the horrible plague they like to LARP on about, then their cushy comfy lives would not be possible...because millions of workers would be dead and millions of others would quit, so supply chains and everything else that makes up modern life would collapse. These obtuse morons have their heads so far up their asses in ignorance and privilege that they live in a delusional la-la land.</p>

        <p>To be fair, most white collar people have no idea where things come from or how they actually work.  They manage numbers on spreadsheets.  Not saying that you don't need that done, but that it's a completely skewed perspective of the world where things appear in the spreadsheet but you don't realize it's because something happened in the real world.  You look at the sales, but don't realize that it's because someone put it out for sale after someone else delivered it after someone shipped it after it was made in a factory out of things mined from somewhere and so on.  It looks like something just appeared on a spreadsheet, but really, it appeared because a whole lot of other things happened in the real world.</p>

        <p>So much of this has to do w hate for “the other side”.  This is less to do w the actual virus and all to do with the Federal response to the virus. This form of collectivism is legitimately left vs right and it has so much to do with hate of the current administration.</p>

        <p>You nailed it. I’d also add in that many of these people are the type that say they have ‘anxiety’-in quite bc yes I know for many anxiety is a serious disorder and it’s hard to deal with, especially now-but there are some that...say they have it when they don’t to try to get out of doing basic things like having to make small talk, go see their SO’s family, deal with their family that might not think exactly like them...like the South Park episode. Lockdowns gave them an indefinite pass to not do any of those things for a long time.</p>

        <p>Straight from the article: </p>
<p>''Most people, as it has turned out, are more concerned with protecting themselves and their families than flattening the curve. So we used — and in some instances capitalized on — those fears to strengthen the message about the importance of staying home. While this may have been effective in the short-term, it is hurting the country now.'' </p>
<p>Yeah this doen't seem messed up at all, let's try getting people to stay at home by capitalizing on their fears, that seems like a totally great and not messed up idea.</p>

        <p>Yeah talk to the news outlets putting shit out like “you’ll maybe never be allowed to see your family ever again” and “we’re not going back to normal”. I wonder why humans have decided facing the virus is worth it. Maybe because they’re being pumped relentlessly with shit like “life will just always be this miserable pit of despair so get used to it because we can’t catch a virus with a 99.8% survival rate”. Tired of this shit.</p>

        <p>No, this is not the public’s fault. Blame our governors who have come out and said there is no full reopening until a vaccine. Blame the governors who mandated masks instead of educating the public in what masks do and don’t do and let people decide for themselves. Blame the businesses who now refuse to hear medical exceptions for not wearing a mask. I’m an adult and at six months into this, we should be able to address why it’s still OK for my state’s governor to decide how I will live my life. Everyone knows the symptoms and risk factors and that some environments are riskier than others. It’s time to open everything and let US decide how we want to live and what activities we feel comfortable with. </p>
<p>Newsflash, but this is America and there are a lot of people who hate government overreach and having every minutia of their lives over regulated. And tell me why again I am required to worry about everybody’s health when I don’t even know anyone at risk? You protect your high risk family and recommend they stay inside if you’re that worried. Why do you expect college students and people who want a vacation to do that for you?</p>

        <p>People, particularly in coastal cities, seem to not grasp the fact that many people don’t want big government involvement in their lives and want to be left to do their thing. </p>
<p>Also I kind of legit think there’s a type of Stockholm syndrome happening with doomers and the extreme lockdown governors.  Six months in and they all still have fairly high approval ratings (maybe a small dip but still far above average)...people are so used to hearing these men and women  dictate their lives that now they see them as their savior, which is bad when people feel that way of Kim Jung Un (rightfully), but okay if it’s Newsom or one of those guys</p>

        <p>What do you think of this weed proposal? I think it’s a good bargaining chip for the legislature, meaning they can go back to him and say sure we will legalize it but we want you to ease up on restrictions and get rid of the mask mandates.  But legalizing weed is the not the major revenue stream that people think it is.  It also comes w high regulatory costs.</p>

        <p><em>It's novel</em> - no, it isn't, we've had related Corona viruses in circulation, likely why so many people never develop symptoms. Plus, after 9 months it isn't novel any longer.</p>
<p><em>We don't know the consequences</em> - yes we do, old age is the greatest risk factor, and both mortality and occasional side effects are very rare. </p>
<p><em>We don't know if we can develop immunity</em> - yes, we know, Covid-19 is not AIDS. Plenty of research shows that immunity lasts longer than a few months and protects well.</p>

        <p>I don't like it when these people scoff at individuals and do a lot of "for the good of the whole society" handwaving.  This author used this rhetorical trick. I've seen too much along the lines of "our society banded together to win WWII, but we're too selfish not to do that for this disease."  Utter nonsense - these are two completely different situations. </p>
<p>Doctors cure individuals, not societies.  I get that there's a social aspect to disease transmission, but most of these people seem to have a poor understanding of what could actually work and what is just pointless coercion. Those who talk about "messaging" usually lean toward coercion, though messaging in theory is about conveying accurate information to allow individuals to make good decisions.  In practice, it's mostly about 'framing' the information so that individuals "won't be exposed to misinformation."  I'd even say that approach helped when they were up against the tobacco companies, who already had a loud megaphone and had been framing the issue their way for decades.  But here it's being used to suppress individual choice by limiting the range of acceptable opinion.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have read the comments under the original post.  Too many people there saying "it's not about 'flatten the curve', it's about STOP THE VIRUS!  STOP THE VIRUS! STOP THE VIRUS!"  Sorry but there's no way to 'stop' any virus, that's magical thinking.  You might as well cast a warding spell.</p>

        <p>Over 5M cases and the reality for a lot of Americans is either that COVID spread so little in their communities that they struggle to even name people that had it, or COVID spread so quickly through their community that they're already at herd immunity and currently just locked down for political reasons.  </p>

        <p>In Ontario, a province of nearly 15,000,000, we have had, total, 41,813 cases, and 2,803. Of the latter, 80% were in long term care homes. That means, outside of this, not even accounting for age, the total deaths were 560 over the last six months. </p>

        <p>You pesky covidiots with your inconvenient facts, why can't you just #stayhome to #savelives?! <em>People are dying!!!</em>  this is about <em>following the rules!!!</em></p>
<p>The news told me that we shouldn't do our own research so how <em>dare</em> you actually look at the data.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>But yeah, it's absolutely nutters how even in ON &amp; QC that accounts for the lion's share of cases and deaths, there's really nothing to actually, logically justify all of this absolute lunacy.</p>
<p>What's really bizarre is even places like Nunavut have instituted all manner of similar covid 'measures'.</p>

        <p>I’m in the area and only personally know of a few that got it but none even had to go to the hospital. My moms ex actually contracted it and he’s in his sixties, has severe diabetes, is a transplant recipient, survived Leukemia, and had some severe heart issues earlier this year...just felt crappy for a few days but recovered and was at home the whole time-someone we legit thought would die if he got it.</p>

<p>Messaging has changed so often, nobody wants to listen anymore. People don't trust public officials at face value, and why should they at this point? The government and other "institutions of authority" already consider your average person to be irrational and incapable of making their own decisions. Who would even want to listen to such cynical people? They don't have your interests at heart.</p>

<p>I mean, could be "orange man bad", but there's no need for me to be cynical, right?</p>
<p>That said: I'm fairly surprised at how often people dunk on the government, only to beg them to play authoritarian parent when things go south.</p>

        <p>I really think it’s largely Orange Man bad, and I’m on the left. </p>
<p>Dems learned nothing from 2016, impeaching Trump failed, came down to two candidates (Sanders and Biden) that people knew had a horrible shot at beating Trump (but for different reasons), most of my friends right before lockdowns were pretty sure Trump would easily win again. Then coronavirus came and lockdowns followed...and a new tactic to win. Granted I think Trump has also handled things poorly, but there’s been a few times he’s actually been right and the left destroys him just because he said it.</p>

        <p>honestly, the science has barely changed in 6 months, it's just   <br>
the messengers are a bunch of politically motivated fucktards, <br>
so once you learn to ignore them, being covid safe gets clear.<br>
example; it was always clear indoor dining would be a problem,    <br>
so when they keep genuflecting over rules to please someone,    <br>
i ignore all noise and just continue to avoid indoor dining... duh.</p>
