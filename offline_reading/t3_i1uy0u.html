    <strong>The degraded and downright frightening experience that James Madison University is giving its students this fall</strong>
    <p><p>This is what my alma mater, JMU, is doing this fall, from a letter shared on /r/jmu.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dear JMU Students,</p>
<p>We are actively planning for your return to campus in a few short weeks. I can’t wait to have you back and see you on campus and around Harrisonburg after so many months apart. To make our in-person experience possible this fall, it will take every single one of us working together, making good decisions and looking out for each other. While the Fall 2020 semester will be different, we believe that the power and impact of the JMU experience will still be there for all of our students.</p>
<p>I want you to know that we are doing everything we can to help ensure your safety. All campus spaces will be set up for physical distancing, all members of our community will be wearing masks, all shared spaces will be cleaned and sanitized throughout the day and hand sanitizer will be available everywhere. These steps, along with a number of other measures, are outlined in our Stop the Spread plan, which was certified and approved by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia on July 23.</p>
<p>What is critical to our ability to open—and stay open— is an unwavering commitment to take actions that will help curb the spread of COVID-19 and avoid an outbreak that could cause the university to transition to entirely online learning. A number of things will be asked of you, both prior to your return and every day after returning to campus.</p>
<p>It is essential that each of us wears a mask, practices physical distancing, completes daily health screenings and contacts the University Health Center if they have COVID-19 symptoms. These, and other measures outlined below, are not meant to be punitive, but will instead give us a higher likelihood of a successful and safe in-person semester.</p>
<p>Students are expected to do the following prior to coming to campus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Isolate for eight days prior to returning to campus. All students should isolate to the greatest extent possible for a full eight days prior to returning to on-campus or off-campus housing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete online eLearning and pass the quiz. This eLearning will outline what is expected of students in additional detail, share the safeguards that the university is implementing, inform students how to seek support should they need it and test students’ knowledge. The deadline to complete the training within Canvas is August 14. The Canvas course is titled, “JMU Students Return to Campus 2020.” The course is available now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree to the COVID-19 Stop the Spread Agreement. Each student is required to agree to the agreement as part of the Fall 2020 check-in process or they will have a hold placed on their record that will prevent class registration. The agreement spells out expectations and noncompliance with these commitments that could result in a referral to the Office of Student Accountability and Restorative Practices. The deadline to sign the agreement within MyMadison is August 14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete health screening questions each day. Prior to returning to campus, and each day thereafter, students are expected to complete health screening questions related to body temperature and COVID-19 symptoms on the LiveSafe mobile app. Students can download the LiveSafe on an iPhone or Android. Information on how to access LiveSafe on desktop and laptop computers is coming soon.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once on campus, students are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wear a mask. Students will need to bring their own masks from home, and are expected to wear them at all times when in the presence of others. This includes in the residence halls when you are outside of your room. Students should also bring with them a thermometer, plenty of hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practice physical distancing and avoid large gatherings. Physical distancing should be observed to the fullest extent possible both indoors and outdoors. Additionally, no student is to host or attend any off-campus social gathering of more than 10 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow prescribed protocols if you are part of a student organization. Each student organization will pledge to host meetings virtually whenever feasible. When meetings must be held in person, they are to be held on campus and organizations need to adhere to space capacity, masking and distancing protocols. A virtual option must also be offered. Off-campus events and activities will not be allowed and travel for student organizations is prohibited, which includes, but is not limited to regional or national meetings or competitions. These policies will be strictly enforced with penalties up to and including revoking university recognition of the organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More information on the aforementioned mandatory training, student agreement and symptom checking through the LiveSafe app is forthcoming, so please be on the lookout. I can’t stress enough that it is no one individual’s job to keep campus safe and healthy this fall. It is everyone’s job. And while this fall will look different than the past, we are working hard to offer as much normalcy as possible for all of our students.</p>
<p>Even in uncertain times, what we know to be true about JMU is that it’s the people that make this place special. The way we choose to treat each other this fall, the caution we choose to exercise and the actions we take will impact us as individuals and as a community.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help to stop the spread and I look forward to seeing you in a few short weeks. Go Dukes!</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but if I were planning to attend, after seeing this, I would take a year off.</p></p>

        <p>Can't wait to see how low school registration numbers are. No parent in their right mind would send their kid into this orwellian nightmare(primary/secondary ed). I'm sure college/university numbers will be way down as well.</p>

        <p>Not true. Penn State enrollment is up by a few percentage points from last year, to the distress of some permanent residents. I wish more people would understand that taking a gap year or semester often isn’t easy. You risk losing financial aid, and some required classes are only offered once a year or even every other year.</p>

        <p>Yes. We must stop acting like anyone is “forcing” us to wear a mask and end our dependence on those that would require them. I’ve read too many post in these subs about people who hate it but do it because of the pressure, the anxiety, the convenience, all of which fueled the mandates. It must be the duty of every person who disagrees with universal mandatory masking to full-heartedly refuse to mask.</p>

        <p>The university has always been like that. In their mind, you are a JMU student first, and belong to them. Therefore, if you get in trouble off campus, it comes back to them, and you have to go through university processes as well, just because you're a student. I agree with you that it's an overreach, and never liked it because the university was way up in everyone's business far more than it needed to be.</p>

        <p>I would opt out for this year if I was a student if I had to put up with this: </p>
<p>&rt; Students will need to bring their own masks from home, and are expected to wear them at all times when in the presence of others. This includes in the residence halls when you are outside of your room. </p>
<p>Naturally they are going to hang out with others without a mask and have parties because that’s what college kids have always done. But this time the schools, the media, and politicians are setting them up to get shamed. Doesn’t matter students that age are among the lowest risk group.</p>

        <p>I really hope their admissions drop. I could not fathom paying for something that would try to control my life that much. It is not their business what people choose to do off campus either. Hopefully people take the year off instead of dealing with what seems like hell.</p>

        <p>My university is like “yeah we’re gonna test people in the dorms right before school starts then good luck!” I’m so glad my alma mater didn’t cave to the insanity. It’s a huge party school and they probably understand that it’s futile to impose many restrictions when people party completely off campus in houses as it is.</p>

        <p>&rt;Off-campus events and activities will not be allowed and travel for student organizations is prohibited, which includes, but is not limited to regional or national meetings or competitions. These policies will be strictly enforced with penalties up to and including revoking university recognition of the organization.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Practice physical distancing and avoid large gatherings. Physical distancing should be observed to the fullest extent possible both indoors and outdoors. Additionally, no student is to host or attend any off-campus social gathering of more than 10 people.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty much like Pensacola Christian College or Bob Jones University but with even more rules.</p>
