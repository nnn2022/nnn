    <strong>The vaccines are being used as a backdoor for mRNA genetic engineering</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd4278</p>
<p>mRNA will be used in genetic engineering in the near future. This is a major reason why mRNA vaccines have gotten such positive press compared to the Astra Zeneca and J&amp;J vaccine.</p>
<p>They are priming the population for acceptance of genetic engineering and all kinds of biological modifications. The elites truly want to become superior and with this technology they will create designer babies as their children. </p>
<p>It will be a true dystopia. This along with some kind of microchip ID in our brains and they think they can control humanity's destiny. </p>
<p>Resist this transhunanist dystopia and fight for freedom.</p></p>

        <p>The creative process is a conduit for a broader intelligence, for sure. Consciousness informs itself by experiencing itself, on many levels.. one of them being, a human creating content, which In turn informs other versions of itself on the state of the world, where we’re going and what to look for. Art informs us on many levels.</p>
<p>Not lecturing just trying to articulate something I see. Hope it made sense</p>

        <p>Thank you, I really appreciate your information. Beautifully and well articulated for a layman/dumb guy like myself. Thank you, I really mean it. Nowadays things like art &amp; music are being quashed in favour of courses or teachings on how to make money or how to take more resources from Earth, all for the sake of greed. I wish our world could get rid of all these greedy power hungry psychopaths. I feel soon all mankind will awaken to a very large revelation in about 4 years from now. I have these dreams, and something tells me that by 2025 something big will happen, and in 2024 mankind has to make a decision before the clock strikes twelve reaching to 2025 (so to speak). :(</p>

        <p>Not that I’m into Astrology, but this is when the Age of Aquarius will dominate. Kinda interesting to read about if you get a chance. </p>
<p>I know the Elites and the Powers that Be are really into occult stuff. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that all of this great reset baloney is happening at this time.</p>

        <p>Oh, I enjoy reading Astrology, and similarly I feel strongly that the occult plays a huge part in how the Elites/NWO operates. I feel many (and I mean <em>many</em>) traditions are based on black magic brought all the way from ancient Babylonia, possibly even dating further back to ancient Sumeria, from the time of the Anunaki. Just a hunch, but I suspect it so.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s crazy how much of occult magick is part of our daily experience. I’m sure I’m still oblivious to most of it.</p>
<p>Also, isn’t it wild how the transition from the Age of Pisces to Aquarius is all about science and wokism with Saturn’s authoritarian dominance? When I heard that man I got the willies.</p>

        <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I didn’t have a time line, me personally, but I have this deep intuition that something big is coming! So we’re on the same page 
Imo the greed is the result of a spiritual problem. I think over the next few years many people will be going through crises, of some kind, breaking apart all that debris on the “inner lens” that which influences the way they see and interact with the world! It’s going to be a crazy few years and hopefully we make it though. Although, I’m highly optimistic we will  prevail because let’s face it “we” were never the ones in control. We are quite literally the “hands of god” although I do not prefer that language. I’d rather think of us as extension of the universe itself. We act mainly from our unconscious which is “controlled” by reality herself.  So have “faith” we’re good but that doesn’t mean we should sit back and do nothing; after all, “she” wouldn’t let that happen. She kicks my ass until I learn and listen.. again, not a fan of the expression of that idea but after all language was designed to conceal intention, you could say.</p>
<p>Take it easy !</p>

        <p>Thank you brother, yes I love your analogies. I think sometimes "God" or "the Divine Source" kicks our butt from time to time to make us realize that we need to grow as a species and/or to wake-up in how there are evil parasites out there feeding off of us, etc. </p>
<p>I feel it's going to get a bit hectic and crazy too in the coming years, but I guess these are the birthing pains for humanity to wake-up &amp; be reborn in a way. </p>
<p>Cheers man, and thank you! Keep on posting info, the community could use more enlightening news or stories from time to time. :)</p>

        <p>Thank you, I had no idea about his brother. I'm going to look up "Science and its Effect on Society" by Bertrand Russell, as well as google "Control+F injections". It sounds very ominous. Do you think we'll make it as a species? Or be forever trapped by the machinations of these secret societies? I'm starting to hate all these secretive groups who work behind the scenes, trying to undermine mankind.</p>

        <p>I meant search for "injections" in the Russle essay haha, so you can find the most relevant part.</p>
<p>I am more optimistic these days. I have heard a lot of people say COVID was a rushed attempt to get us all vaccinated because they are losing power. Look up the Corona Committee, a group of lawyers taking on the COVID agenda. Also, there was a post a while back, screenshots of a conversation with a Moderna employee. Apparently the company was freaking out because people were dying. They didn't want that, they wanted it to be more subtle and make the NEXT generation of children be very unhealthy and infertile. They're not nearly as clever as they think.</p>
