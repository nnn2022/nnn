        <p>This is a quote from a self proclaimed apostle named Paul, who never met Jesus yet claimed the title given to the 12 who lived and breathed with him. </p>
<p>A man who tortured his followers to death, until the message wouldn't stop spreading and so he had a "vision", witnessed by no one but himself of course and became the head honcho. </p>
<p>Then he proceeded to contradict everything Jesus said, made people concentrate on the idol of Jesus (and his self appointed high priest of course) rather than his message. He also constantly maligned other churches not under his control as not being "true followers". </p>
<p>I believe Paul was a corrupter of Christianity. A false insider, much like Trump was to true conservatives. </p>
<p>Christ himself was quite anarchist and anti government in most of his teachings. He himself was crucified by the government. </p>
<p>The only saying of Christ which might be construed as for govt. is the "render unto caesar that which belongs to caesar" quote, which gauging by the crowds reaction can also be construed as subtly subversive (don't use caesar's currency and you don't owe him jack).</p>

<p>Interesting. Plenty of occurrences in the Bible where it is just to disobey the authorities. The scripture mentioned in OP is not blind obedience to everything the governing bodies say.</p>
<p>PS please forgive the mention of Trump in article.</p>

        <p>Look at the evil around you and read it predicted in a 2000 year old scroll called Revelations and you'll have your evidence</p>
<p>"16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."</p>

        <p>It is no great feat to predict that men will be evil and wish to control others through branding. We've been branding animals for many thousands of years before those fairy tales were written, so it's no great leap of logic to get the idea to brand humans. They already did it with their slaves.</p>
<p>What would have been fucking amazing and make people question things is if the book had said people would carry around "books" in their pocket with ever changing information, and that these "books" would keep track of their location and information. Or that the mark of the beast was not actually a branding but a tiny piece of metal with info about the person and was put under the skin. How about when the Earth had to be populated through incest not once but twice, which as we now know is impossible due to genetic degradation of offspring. They could've said god used his magic powers to enable Adam and Eve, Noah and his family to repopulate the Earth safely without birth defects.</p>
<p>But the book of fables says none of these things because they weren't divinely inspired by an all-knowing god, they were written by ignorant savages.</p>

        <p>I agree most of the old testament was written by ignorant men. Most Christians try to reconcile it with Jesus' teachings but it is too inconsistent and cruel. The Bible as a book wasn't even put together centuries after Christ.</p>
<p>Personally I really mostly find divinity in the New Testament teachings of Christ and the Book of Revelations. Jesus sometimes  vaguely refers to some events recorded in the old testament, but he never specifically validates an existing set of records or scrolls about them as divine or accurate. If anything he lashes out as scribes as being evil and putting a heavy yoke on people. I believe there are parts of the OT that are divine but humans have mixed in a ton of control, cruelty and agendas in there. </p>
<p>However, thay being said, if predicting future evil was so easy why haven't you seen any other thousands year old religion / prophet / seer predict a GLOBAL system of economic control that we see unfolding? Go ahead, give me another book that predicted this, since it was soooo obvious according to you. And not a 50 year old sci-fi book that saw recent events like Hitler etc., I'm talking hundreds or thousands of years. </p>
<p>Not to mention slaves may have existed but never in history until now was there possible a system to enslave ALL of humanity. Lastly the huge coincidence of seeing a specific number 666 so often in all these. The 6 6 6 guard numbers in barcodes, the 666 in the patent above, and also the dye LUCIFERIN used in the mark patent. </p>
<p>Seriously why call it that? For almost 2000 years, Lucifer was known to be the name of the devil, it has no other relevant context whatsoever. I mean even Lucin would be ok if you wanted to refer to a glowing substance, but LuciFER? It is specifically a name for the devil, you'd have to live under a rock not to know that. </p>
<p>Why then go out of your way to name the dye that, and why specifically use it in this exact mark that is patented by this exact man driving us towards a global "vaccine passport" without which it will be difficult to conduct any business?</p>
<p>Lastly even the book of "ignorants" you mention predicted a Spherical Earth suspended in space 3000 years ago, the correct order of creature evolution or appearance on earth even though allegorically and so on. I'll look up and put the relevant verses in my next quote. Go on, give me other 3000 year old scroll (and these have been verified by the findings of the Dead Sea Scrolls) that give this sort of science WAAAY ahead of its time.</p>
