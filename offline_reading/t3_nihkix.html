        <p>This article is based on one core fallacy: that Yellow Card reporting indicates a <em>confirmed</em> side effect rather than a <em>potential</em> side effect. The MHRA have explicitly said that this is not the case. </p>
<p>Misleadingly, it links directly to the PDFs of the Yellow Card data rather than to the MHRA page which explains exactly what the data means. You can find the summary page here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting</p>
<p>Some key quotes from that page:</p>
<p>&rt;Any member of the public or health professional can submit suspected side effects through the Yellow Card scheme.</p>
<p>&rt;It is important to note that Yellow Card data cannot be used to derive side effect rates or compare the safety profile of COVID-19 vaccinations as many factors can influence ADR reporting.</p>
<p>&rt;Many suspected ADRs reported on a Yellow Card do not have any relation to the vaccine or medicine and it is often coincidental that they both occurred around the same time.</p>
<p>If you actually look at the data, it bears this out:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 people had a sunburn</li>
<li>10 unintended pregnancies</li>
<li>1 fractured their wrist</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously you cannot reach the conclusion that all Yellow Card reports indicate proven side effects from the vaccine. People didn't get pregnant from the vaccine.</p>
