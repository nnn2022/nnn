    <strong>What’s the vaccine motive?</strong>
    <p><p>What is the most likely motive for the vaccine programs? Interested on hearing peoples thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Do you think it’s likely that population control is the sole aim?</p></p>

        <p>Money, but I do believe that there is a diabolical agenda considering that they are still pushing the vaccines despite the horrible side effects and deaths despite the data from VAERS. It's also about power and control, including dividing people amongst themselves between the "Antivax" camp and "provax" camp. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, the main agenda is bringing in the Great Reset. That's pretty much the end game.</p>

        <p>I don't know how I feel about it to be honest.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the very least, it's about money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the very worst, population control and eugenics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And just like most things, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. But I can tell you this... they are hiding the fact that it's not safe. No matter what you think the motivations are, they should not be mandatory, and you have every right to opt out of them. This is a hill I'm willing to die on.</p>

        <p>At best, it was an excuse to get MRNA vaccines in the door.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for COVID, MRNA vaccines would have been permanently banned within a week after the first MRNA vaccine was approved and proved to be ridiculously dangerous. That is, if an MRNA vaccine ever even would have been approved.</p>
<p>But now Pharma companies will be able to get any future MRNA vaccine approved in two seconds, and always have it be considered safe.</p>

        <p>No. I know people who work at the WHO. When covid broke out, estimated deaths in some models were up to 1 billion... so the motive was clearly panic. This can explain how many protocols were thrown out the window and legal immunity given to pharmaceutical companies. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, as data came in and our understanding of covid improved, policies didn't change, nor needed conversations had.</p>

        <p>I am going to go on a small rant here. Perhaps it's just for me to try and articulate some thoughts and see what you peeps think. </p>
<p>This current situation is fucked because there has been a fundamental collapse of some of our largest institutions that their sole purpose is to improve people's lives. The WHO, government (but that's no surprise they failed), many local health authorities that instructed doctors and hospitals what to do, FDA and other countries version of the FDA, and Academia aka the researchers and publishers that distribute the knowledge.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Covid broke out at there was panic at the top. The WHO freaked out which made governments freak out which made them drop pandemic protocols (as many don't know, most countries have thought through pandemic protocols that were thrown away) and continue with an ad hoc approach to make things so much worse.</p>
<p>How?
The structure is bottom up. Once the WHO and governments and the pharmaceutical companies jump in bed together, positive feedback loops were created from the bottom up.
The WHO set the narrative that vaccine everyone is our only way out, the governments repeated them. (That's top down but bare with me).</p>
<p>Once the narrative was set, all of our checks and balances crumbled creating positive feedback loops with the narrative. </p>
<p>Frontline doctors: they see the terror in the hospitals and panic. They believe the vaccine is the only way out. Why? Many were instructed there was no out patient treatment of covid. They could only manage severe symptoms. If doctors went against the narrative, trying drugs like ivermectin or fluvoxamine, they could lose their job. Most stay quiet and do ad they are told, enforcing rhe narrative and a positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>Academics: once the narrative was set, it now became possible that any research against it could potentially be a career destroyer. Many published along the narrative lines and stayed quiet to keep their jobs. Another positive feedback loop. </p>
<p>This goes on and on. Local community groups. Schools. Neighbours. People who questioned the narrative got pushed to the side. </p>
<p>The conversations that need to be had by the right people that need to have them is rarely happening due to these positive feedback loops. That's what I mean by the issue is bottom up. </p>
<p>If this was a top down plan for population control, there would need to be thousands of people across the world with military like obedience to authority. It would be impossible to keep so many people, governments, manufacturers, companies, NGOs, etc in line to execute such an action.</p>
<p>But, seeing this through the eyes of self preservation of an individual, bottom up, and one can see quickly the cluster fuck it creates at every level. </p>
<p>Money and lobbying and politics all have their role to play. Absolutely 💯.  But the scale at which we fucked up could only be caused from the bottom of the pyramid failing. </p>
<p>That's my take right now. We are seeing though more outlaw country types fight their way through and try and get heard. Plus the truth revealed by the data will eventually make itself known. The question is just when.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>A guarantee of future profits for pharmaceutical companies. They can now start producing mRNA treatments because the likelihood of approval is much higher (and they got to not only get all the human trials done without cost but actually profited from it). Long term side effects will require medications which will be produced by the same pharmaceutical companies that produced the “vaccines”.</p>

        <p>I dont think its movie-villian evil stuff in that its to totally alter our DNA or anything.</p>
<p>Same reason why a tyrannical govt wouldnt go using bombs and nukes and jets on its population, they have nothing to rule over if they destroy everything. Im not sold on any narrative that this vaccine is <em>intended</em> to ruin/reduce a population. </p>
<p>Thankfully we have guns and our free choice to protect ourselves from this.</p>
<p>But the vaccine is for money. And more insidiously, I think its to get people to join the narrative that the govt is virtuous and will always protect us. Same reason peak pandemic level unemployment rates are being offered while countless small businesses are need of workers. They want us dependent on them to the point that they and theyre elite cohort (big corporations) are the only ones with influence.</p>
<p>This why they have made this a battle over morality. Govt and big pharma were the bad guys to so many until they were sold the narrative that they’re saving the world from a horrible virus, and that if you take this vaccine you’re a hero doing your part.</p>
<p>All the horrible side effects many experience, they just dont care about them. I’m one of the few in my circle that hasnt been vaccinated. Thankfully no one ik has had any side effects except being a little sleepy the day after. </p>
<p>I still wont take the vax based on my on view of the risk/reward and out of resentment for how its being pushed as a ticket to freedom. Fuck them for that.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's for money. I think its for something bigger. I think the elite believe that over population is a big issue and that climate change is a big issue. I don't think they are tricking the entire planet just to sell vaccines. There's something in the vaccine. My guess is that they are trying to sterilize a great the majority of the world. By doing this they think that they solved over population and climate change. They think they're doing the right thing. Wouldn't sterilizing the entire planet be called a great reset?</p>
<p>Edit: If they were only doing it for money why would they sell a vaccine that is killing people? Why have a vaccine at all? Why not just sell syringes with water in them? It would be cheaper.</p>
