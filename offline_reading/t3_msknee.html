    <strong>Not ready to give up on dream of living in California...need some pointers on where to go</strong>
    <p><p>California has always been the dream for me. And I don't mean L.A. and flashy places like that. Just scenery and weather-wise. The beautiful forests, hills, and valleys really call to me. I know it's a blue state, I know there's intense mandates. But I hate that my options for where to live have, in the last year, become dictated by politics. I depressingly wrote off California as an option for a while now ever since this all went down, but I'm extremely worried that I'll get to a point where I regret not "following my dreams". I'm not ready to call it quits just yet. </p>
<p>SO, I've heard there are parts of California that people say are relatively normal and don't mandate too harshly. I've got a map up of red and blue counties, but I'm not sure if just looking at red counties is trustworthy enough. I live in Wisconsin which is a blue state as well, but the rural areas are all red and really normal and chill for the most part. Am I correct in thinking this applies the same in California?</p></p>

        <p>I moved out of CA several years ago, best decision I ever made. I was born and raised there and lived in a red part of the state. It’s insanely expensive and the taxes are just ridiculous. State taxes will follow you no matter what area you live in. Best decision I ever made was moving elsewhere. The majority of my family followed and they’re just as happy as I am being in a different state.</p>
<p>Go visit, enjoy, and then go home lol</p>

        <p>Yes, if you go outside of the cities, for the most part it becomes red country real quick.</p>
<p>Really depends on if you want forest, mountain, or desert as cali has all 3 in the countryside. </p>
<p>Humboldt/north of san francisco is the place people go to live in a forest be left alone and smoke weed all day. </p>
<p>The deserts east/north of LA/San Diego is where the weirdos go to smoke meth, take psychedelics and live in a trailer. </p>
<p>The Sierras/Big Bear/Mammoth is where people go to ski/canoe/hike on vacation. </p>
<p>I'm stereotyping of course, but that is kind of the gist of it.</p>

        <p>As someone who lives in a red county in CA, here are my top recommendations for counties you should look into...</p>
<ul>
<li>Placer County (I think someone already mentioned this one)</li>
<li>El Dorado County</li>
<li>One town in Sacramento County, Folsom, borders El Dorado County and is much more conservative than the rest of Sac County</li>
<li>Beach town Carlsbad (near San Diego) tends to lean more red</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to message me for more details, my husband and I have lived in CA our whole lives. Just bought our first house here. We’d love to answer any more specific questions :)</p>

        <p>Thank you for the recommendations! Lots to still consider but I will be looking into those counties for sure. </p>
<p>Since you're open to questions, basically, my first thought is: You're living in California, but from being on this subreddit, I would assume you are against the "new normal" ....how is that and how are you dealing? Like, I'm basically just curious about how it's going over there with all this from the perspective of someone who actually lives there, not just reading the news. You say you just bought a house (congrats) so I'm guessing it's fine and you're not trying to "escape" California?</p>

        <p>To be honest, we have had a really hard time with all the lockdowns. At the time, we both were working for small businesses, and both of those small businesses only survived the lockdowns by pure miracle. It was pretty bad, but ever since our state got enough signatures on the Recall Newsom petition, and he had a bunch of lawsuits that declared his rules (like shutting down churches) unconstitutional, Newsom has been easing up, simply because he’s afraid of getting booted out of office. Newsom is an absolute power hungry piece of trash, and I know many people who despite being very terrified of covid and brainwashed by everything, still hate him. (Funny side note - he lives in one of the red counties, perhaps to escape the full extent of the BS rules that he has mandated?) </p>
<p>If we weren’t living in a red county, we would have gotten out of here a long time ago. In our county, lots of businesses allow you to not wear masks, people are openly libertarian or conservative, and have been in rebellion against the lockdowns by staying open. even there though, it’s nothing like red states.</p>
<p>We absolutely love California climate, especially the beaches, and because of my husband’s new job, we will be in California for awhile. However, at least for us, we have a solid back up plan to move to Nevada or Texas in case California gets so crazy that the nonsense starts affecting the red counties more.</p>
<p>One note is that CA is crazy expensive (as I’m sure you already know). Our house is just a small townhome, 2 bed 2.5 bath, in need of repair and hasn’t been updated since it was built the 90s. We got it for a KILLER deal at $270k. Most other similar townhomes in the area starts at $300k. A newer 3 bed 2 bath home will easily start at $500k. Decent 2 bed apartments range between $1600-$2200. And the red counties are considered the cheaper areas of CA.</p>

        <p>Wow, yes, that is very lucky and good that your small businesses managed to survive. That has to be incredibly stressful to have to worry about. </p>
<p>Regarding Newsom, yep, I would also think you are right about him living in a red county to not have to comply with the rules. With all the photos I've seen of governors and other politicians not following their own mandated rules, I would not be surprised at all if that's the case lol. </p>
<p>I'm really glad to hear that lots of people in the red counties are pushing back as well. Despite social media and the majority of what you see online, it actually seems like there are tons of people against this stuff which is great. </p>
<p>Yeah, the high cost of living is pretty much why I'm holding out on California until I save up some more. Especially with the climate now, I want to make sure I have a backup plan, as you said, in case it gets as bad there as Canada. I hope every day that the future will be better, that maybe we're in the worst of it now and that we start on an upward trend back to getting our rights and lives back. I understand people not wanting to get doxed, lose their jobs, and become social outcasts, but I really advocate for people speaking out and not complying when possible.</p>
