    <strong>Life Imitating Art - RE: The Stuff ( 1985 movie), Star Trek The Game Episode and Vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>So I was responding to a thread in this sub-reddit titled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nx6etq/people_please/">People please...</a>" where the OP told the audience "get your god damn vaccine (I have mine)." As we have been seeing all over the place, the media, sports athletes, celebrities, the governments and even up to and including friends or family pushing the experimental medical treatment (aka, the vaccine).</p>
<p>As I was thinking what to write, metaphorically speaking, it hit me like a brick. Where have I seen this before? Where have I seen people advertising, encouraging (re: pushing like drug dealers), and almost like becoming like a cult? Take a look at this movie, it is called, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stuff">"The Stuff" by Larry Cohen</a> (wiki), and here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ROA_ZEGfA">trailer for that movie</a>. We have heard the saying, "life imitates art," right? Here is a perfect example of it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6sRCaP9gYU">Here is the movie</a> on YouTube, and see for yourself.</p>
<p>As you look at the trailer, then the movie, every time some says the phrase, "The Stuff" just replace that with, "The Vaccine" and you'll see it is a perfect fit for what is going on right now with the media, government and citizenry pushing the vaccines. The little boy in that movie reflects the people today who speak out, but are generally ignored, labeled and dismissed. They're called crazy, anti-vaxxers, science deniers, etc. because "The Stuff" is good for you!</p>
<p>An episode in Star Trek, where the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Game_(episode)#Summary">episode (The Game)</a> imitates life in our present time. Where a game (re: the vaccine), is pushed to every one, and of course, Wesley Crusher (the lone dissenter), is trying to warn people about the dangers of the game, but is dismissed and ignored until it is almost too late. </p>
<p>Isn't it interesting that the one's being called "crazy" are the one's with the most sense? May be it is because we dare do the one thing many others have not done: question. I don't know, just something I thought of and was fresh on my mind.</p></p>

        <p>I used to have this movie on VHS back in the 90's and it always made me laugh. Never thought it would become a reality ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚</p>
