    <p><p>There is not going to be a 'new normal'.</p>
<p>We've lived through polio, the black plague, aids, spanish flu, small pox, 2 world wars etc. None have changed the way we live.</p>
<p>A virus with a 99.5% survival rate will change how we live? No way.</p>
<p>This bullshit will end.</p></p>

        <p>That's the thing.</p>
<p>The difference between all those events, and this one was that they didn't change the way people were living for the most part. People weren't forced to wear masks, "social distance", lockdown, etc. Although I'm sure people lost work, and there were some deaths involved, those past events didn't feel so...exaggerated as this feels. It feels like the suffering, job loss, deaths, etc are for nothing.</p>

        <p>Essentially emotional blackmail (do this or something awful will happen). I feel like I'm trapped in a demon headmaster novel. Everyone's under the control of the media, doing what the government says, regardless of how ridiculous or how much in infringes on our rights. They condemn people who disagree (essentially policing others). This is sick. We're in terrible danger. I hope i don't sound like I am being dramatic. I hope I am being melodramatic.</p>

        <p>The people living in all of those times were much harder people who were not so insulated from the realities of the world around them.  If you go back a hundred years, almost everyone would have at least one child who had died in their families before reaching adulthood, regardless of whether some new disease was happening or not.  The average person living in a modern western democracy has no concept of risk and seems to have completely lost the mental framework required in order to make judgements about risk.  This is why you see people wearing masks yet walking along the street smoking a cigarette.  I feel like people living in those times would be horrified to see what we have become.</p>
<p>The media and governments are using that as it makes people incredibly easy to manipulate, as we can see all around us.  I would argue that there is a case to be made that governments have deliberately engineered this lack of critical thinking faculties by building it in to the modern education system.</p>

        <p>I do agree. My city recently passed a bylaw for it; while I still disagree with it I’m able to compromise with it given that it does have an end date. I think in my cities instance it seems more to be targeted at getting everyone to wear them so that sick people will wear them with the idea its only a minor inconvenience—silly, yes. Like is this where we are as adults? Because 1 person doesn’t want to do something logical (seriously if you’re sick wear a mask or stay home), everyone else has to do it with them to get them to comply?</p>

        <p>People are silly at times and enjoy downvoting names they regularly see that they disagree with. It’s like the conversation I had yesterday on Reddit where some user insisted they provided me proof cotton masks are super effective, they didn’t, and they didn’t even bother to read my links (literally responded to my links with dismissive responses a minute or two after my post). Like I’d honestly be more content if people were honest about why they are wearing masks.</p>

        <p>There will be a a new normal and increasing medical martial law unless people actually wake up and do something about this. This isn’t a global “oops” that will be corrected. This is an intentional destabilization of society in order to implement a global monetary reset, create a unified world government run by technocrats, and increasingly surveil everything we do.</p>

        <p>This guy gets it. Tried to make a post pointing to something similar in r/LockdownSkepticism and they blocked it for being too conspiratorial. But if you can't see the conspiracy now, with the global elite blatantly calling for a Global Reset (WEF), then I don't know how else to make anyone see.</p>

<p>I'd like to do more, and I've tried to discuss it. But realistically, what can a handful of us really do? We're just too much in the minority to make any sort of meaningful splash. And worst of all, even if people were aware of what was going on, they'd probably still welcome the "New Normal" as they seem to be doing right now.</p>

        <p>Yes. Be the message you want to see.</p>
<p>Today I went to my family doctor who is a pretty easy-going woman (a treasure). She basically seemed to agree that the whole thing was bullshit. I believe she even made the basic point (but it's still rare that anyone, especially an authority figure, makes it) that NO ONE CONSULTED US BEFORE DOING THIS. ABOUT ANY OF IT. She talked about the cost-benefit aspect. It was such a relief to hear her.  Would you believe at that point I told her that I was a member of an internet forum full of rational people about "Lockdown Skepticism"? This is my life now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I visited my hairdresser and I have the funny feeling she's all in. Appointment only now, whether she's free or not. Customer must wear mask (with ~80 cases EVER in my 10,000 square mile "zone", none active, and no death.) I wish I could learn to cut/shave my own hair but I have complicated hair. I am happy to help retail destroy itself in those cases where it is asking to be destroyed, and in turn support anyone rational (maybe some barber at half the price too?). </p>
<p>Today I also was able to buy my underwear without ordering it online and curb pickup (WTF). <strong>Progress!!(??)</strong> Bodies are still considered contaminated (you figured that out just now dudes?) so the dressing rooms are closed. Oh, except for shoes. You can try those on because ~~work boots have high profit margins~~ feet are sterile.</p>
<p>Major drugstore chain here is almost totally self checkout now, and I pay for the plastic bags (if I admit to the machine that I used more than 0, which I don't because fuck that, that's your cost of doing business assholes). I use plastic bags for my garbage, and never buy garbage bags. This is not difficult - they don't go to waste. I recycle everything that I can (which I believe is probably pointless but still do it).</p>
<p>I love how the customer in general has been turned into a free employee. You wonder why people are tempted to cheat with self checkouts? It's called fucking resentment, man. Deep, deep resentment at what corporations get away with. </p>
<p>It's just unbelievable to me. That people are sheep I've known since my days on the playground, but I really didn't understand it in my bones until now. At this point I'd like to go live with the elephants. Those are animals with fucking sense.</p>
<p>Don't mind me I'm loopy from fake-pandemic hurdling.</p>

        <p>The problem is this happening everywhere, even in many other countries. It's getting harder to find a country aside from Sweden (which has its own problems, even though they are anti-lockdown) that people can migrate to. </p>
<p>Also, it's unfair to shame people for not being willing to quit their jobs, sell their homes, forsake their friends and family, etc. Not to mention, do you really think moving from one state to another, or from one <strong>country</strong> to another is cheap and easy?</p>

        <p>I <em>just</em> saw another one of those comments not even a minute ago, at LDS. "Just move to a state that's re-opening!" They really believe this to be super easy, and you can just uproot your entire life in the snap of a finger. What the fuck. I'm sure there are single people who also can't just up and leave either, due to their work, or leases/mortgages or whatever. It just seems so snide and condescending to give people that advice. Not all of us are rich, moving costs a lot of money. Hell, I just moved to a house a year ago, and moving from my apartment to there was very expensive, and I only lived one city over!</p>

        <p>Oh yeah definitely not all single people either for sure.  Just that the people who do feel comfortable doing this are mostly single, able-bodied men, I’d be willing to bet.   </p>
<p>It’s flippant advice just like people on Reddit who immediately say to dump your SO/cut off your family/quit your job, nuclear option right away.</p>
<p>Even some people who can just uproot practically speaking, might not want to live day to day unknown, and even if they got a new stable job, moving is one of the highest stress events in life.</p>

        <p>It's like.</p>
<p>I actually would love to move. My neighbors are pro-lockdown Nazis, I feel uncomfortable in both my home and my state now, and do not like the direction things are headed. If I was a millionaire, sure, I'd drop everything and leave. But realistically, it's not an option for me, financially or even emotionally because moving is stressful. It's rough because I'm sure many, <em>many</em> people right now do wish they could leave, they just can't. It's just not a realistic option.</p>

<p>No, I don’t think it’s cheap or easy. That’s why I said, “it’s hard.”</p>
<p>You’re right that it’s happening everywhere...but it’s a matter of degree. There are red strongholds that are experiencing dramatically less restrictions and the populace isn’t so panicked/masked.</p>

        <p>99.85% is more like it, as recent antibody studies are showing the IFR to be below 0.2% and very close to common flu. This thing is just the birth of a new common cold, as IFR is only that high due to lack of herd immunity. Eventually society must come to terms with the cold hard truth and face what they've done to themselves with their psychotic response.</p>

        <p>I agree that it won't change the way we live but if we can get some positives out of the situation such as allowing people to work from home, giving the option for online appointments and better online access of many businesses then at least there's been one good thing to come of it. The lack of online stuff in my area always used to annoy me, it's 2020. It's forced a lot of places around me to improve their online presence, it's meant my GP will finally talk to me over the phone (I hardly ever feel there's a need to go in person) and it's meant I've saved on a commute. I don't see why all these things can't stay.</p>

        <p>I don’t like not having an in-person life. I want to <em>go to</em> work. Even when I spent 4+ hrs a day commuting. It was time to think. I want to <em>go shopping,</em> in stores, no mask, no tape on the ground, just fun shopping. If I’m paying for an appointment, I want to meet in person. I want to meet people. See people, make eye contact, <em>smile</em>, connect, laugh, share. I’d rather spend my last 8 days doing that than have 80 more days of “distancing,” uncertainty, masks, and treating everyone like they’re diseased. I’d rather me and all the grandparents die of coronavirus than pass this lifestyle, which is as far from normal as it gets, on to the next generation under the bullshit name “new normal.” Fuck that shit.</p>
