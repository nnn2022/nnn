        <p>Thank you for posting this and along with the other post I had made in regards to the Portuguese court that ruled the PCR test unreliable and with up to 90% of false positives, I think a lot of countries have to backtrack and really change the way they do testing without PCR. I am trying to say that the best way around this is to use the LFT test as we have seen side by side on how much more accurate it is for the job! I know it doesn't drive the narrative TPTB would like but fuck it, it's 8+ months into this scam</p>

        <p>I'm just glad it's getting the attention it deserves and we need to make sure we share it with as many people as possible so proper policy changes can be made.</p>

        <p>Part of the thread (it's very long): </p>
<p>ITALIAN NOBEL PRIZE CANDIDATE 2018 Dr Scoglio explains the Covid19 test fraud, there is more to this than false positives: </p>
<p><em>"swabs look for 3 genes characterizing SARS-CoV-2: E gene, RdRp gene &amp; N gene. "If the virus were present, all 3 would have to be found, because if the virus is intact, the only case in which it can have a pathogenic role &amp; infect, the test must find all 3 genes.</em></p>
<p><em>In fact, this was initially the case and the results of the swabs were only positive if all three genes were found. But everything has changed since last April.</em></p>
<p><em>The note of this Italian RT-PCR test reads "from 02/04/2020, in agreement with the regional coordinating center, the detection of even a single SARS-CoV-2 target gene is interpreted as a POSITIVE test".</em></p>
<p><em>Dr. Scoglio hypothesized that, if the initial criteria for communicating the results of the swabs had been maintained, we would almost certainly not have detected all the "asymptomatic positives". 
It can also be read in the Italian RT-PCR results: «Detected positive with CT values under 35. It should be remembered that this condition, in more than 95% of cases, is not associated with the presence of infectivity.</em></p>
<p><em>Fausto Baldanti, Head of the Molecular Virological Unit at the San Matteo Polyclinic in Pavia study results: "In 400 positives with CT 30 only 9 were able to transmit infections to cell cultures (2.3%)."</em></p>
<p>*"Furthermore, not all genes identified by the swab have the same relevance. The researcher Scoglio pointed out that for example:  </p>
<p><strong>"the SARS-Cov 2 E-gene is 100% identical to that of SARS-CoV-1"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Instead, the N gene has only one variation from SARS-CoV-1. "The chances of confusion and cross-reactivity (detecting a SARS virus other than SARS-CoV-2) are very high."</strong></p>
<p><em>The most relevant in the swab results is the RdRP2 gene with 5 out of 64 variations from SARCoV1. The result changes a lot if this gene is found rather than the other two.</em></p>
<p><em>In this specific "POSITIVE", "The only gene detected, as if its non-specificity and cross-reactivity were not enough, was detected with a number of PCR cycles greater than 35, which, according to all serious PCR experts, generates unreliable results , and is generally "junk"</em></p>
<p><em>"The "Drosten PCR Test" &amp; the Institute Pasteur test, considered the most reliable (although neither have been externally validated), both use a test of the E gene, even if the Drosten test uses it as preliminary test, while the Institut Pasteur uses it as a definitive test."</em></p>
<p><em>"According to the authors of the Drosten test, the E-gene test is able to detect all Asian viruses, thus being both very non-specific (all viral strains) and limited to a geographical area (Asia)."</em></p>
<p><em>"And then in April, WHO has changed the protocol recommending that from now on a test can be considered positive even if only the dosage of gene E (WHICH WILL PROBABLY DETECT ALL ASIAN VIRUSES!) gives a positive result”.</em></p>
<p><em>At what cycle thresholds do you effectively create a "ghost virus" out of these gene PCR tests?</em></p>

        <p>Is it any wonder why we have had all the censorship in corporate controlled MSM and social media. It goes against their narrative . Noooo corporate controlled MSM is a threat to our democracy!!!</p>
<p>And Obama said : The internet is “the single biggest threat to our democracy” 
Back in 2008, Barack Obama famously harnessed the internet and social media to help win the White House. He kept up the embrace once he got there.
Obama has been saying a version of this for four years — since he left the White House — but his words are getting steadily more pointed. He’s clearly sounding an alarm, but it’s not exactly clear what he thinks we should do about it.</p>

        <p>Exactly like in the video I saw the other day with a doctor who literally sells covid tests. </p>
<p>He said we need to stop doing testing because that’s giving the numbers, and the numbers are what the media is reporting on. </p>
<p>Along with hospitals being incentivized to claim influenza deaths as covid deaths, the whole fucking thing is fake as hell.</p>
<p>Very concerning that a huge chunk of the population can be so fucking blind to the facts. Even after you show them, they become skeptical because, you know, “fake news”. When the very media they tune into is the culprit. </p>
<p>Sickening, disheartening, and frankly, irritating. This whole thing could’ve been avoided. I can grant credence to those who were confused at first, because most of us were. We’ve had plenty of time to figure this thing out, and yet most of us are buckling in cowardice. Distasteful.</p>
