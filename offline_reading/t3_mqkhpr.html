        <p>So you'd rather give people a preventable disease that is potentially dangerous because of your presumed political bias? That sounds pretty fuck up to me. You didn't bother to read my post, and you're being hypocritical, which is an obvious sign of the Republican tactic of "you go high, we go low."</p>

        <p>It's actually more like a 98% survival rate if we go by infections and deaths, which is being generous, as that isn't an acurate way to portray morality rates.</p>
<p>And that's impressive, as you'd have to read at about 126 words per minute to actually have read that, or 2 words per second. Stop lying about things you don't know.</p>

        <p>Ah, I see, going for the old ignoring my debunk of your original argument to make sure I get the upper hand trick? Not going to work, buddy. I'm not a slow reader, you're just such a liar that you stated indirectly that you could read with such extreme co-ordination that you could read that big blob within two minutes.</p>
<p>As for your second claim, you need to give me some proof for that statement, and if I get into a car crash and I later die of covid in the hospital, then the cause of my death is covid, not the car crash. The car crash simply made me go to the ICU, but the covid killed me because I already had it and was already dying from it. Make sense?</p>

        <p>What do you hope to accomplish by complaining to all of us that you don’t like our views, and demanding that we all do what <em>you</em> think is right? You must know nobody is going to “shut up, wear a mask, get the vaccine” just because you say so.</p>
<p>That said, it can be easy to find our views ridiculous if you haven’t seen our research. Here’s some really good reading/watching material about what a lot of us think, and why:</p>

<p>I accomplish nothing, yes, but that simply shows how incompetent you are for not taking basic MOPP safety because of your bias against old and young people.</p>
<p>You clearly haven't done yiur research, you fool. I actually have done my research, because I trust sources that have actually done research that isn't contradictory to my claims. Your First link is on a shady website that gives constant pop-up, is a .com, and says for people not to hide behind sources in fear of having debate, which is wrong, but it's weird that you used it. Your second source is overall just terrible in every regard. It gives a YouTube video for it's source, and it gives very right wing agenda sources, which again contradicts to your first source. There is no actual evidence for your claims there, as it would defy all common knowledge to even think of doing this, as seen in my original post going over why your "illuminati" wouldn't do that.</p>

        <p>I think you may be misunderstanding what the purpose is of my statement. The first link, while yes, it is a .com, is a well-cited and coherent opinion piece that represents most of our views. The second (the video) represents a theory many of us believe to be true, and the presenter provides extensive empirical proof for his theory in the form of current articles. </p>
<p>These are by no means extensive, but they’re a good starting point for someone like you, who has done your research supporting your current views but doesn’t yet know much about the opposing side. I do have more reading/watching material, such as <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">this list of studies</a> about the vaccine, but they’re a bit denser and more cumbersome to get through.</p>

        <p>Oh, even better.</p>
<p>I feel in facts, common knowledge, and sources that accurately display the real world, not a "well-cited" "opinion piece", which are contradictory statements, as science isn't about opinions. It is in no way coherent on top of the fact that there are constant pop-up ads. The second video isn't a "theory", because it provides no actual empirical data to back it up.</p>
<p>I know much about my opposing side, even though you'll all die out within a few more years. They ARE in no means extensive, or factual, or right, or scientific in any shape or form. I can admit when I'm wrong, but I know when I'm wrong... And this isn't one of those times where I'm wrong. As for your "article", if I can even call it that, is absolutely wrong. I have a fun infographic channel that will help you see why you're wrong. It has no bias, no opinions, and no logical fallacies, only facts based on real empirical studies.</p>

        <p>First of all, if you are going to complain about me giving you YouTube videos, then I really wonder why you are giving <em>me</em> YouTube videos. It seems like a double standard.</p>
<p>Oh, and a side note before I begin, you might benefit from checking the settings on the ad blocker on your browser—I don’t see any of the annoying pop-ups you’re talking about on that first link, so I think you might be able to get rid of them by messing with those settings. The other way is to look at the link on your phone and use the reader view. Let me know if that helps.</p>
<p>However, I did see those videos you sent me, and I am struggling to understand how they relate to my information. The first is an old video from 2019 about conventional vaccines—not emergency mRNA COVID vaccines, on which we don’t yet have much human data for obvious reasons (fast development, emergency release, etc.). The second is a general video with some basic information about COVID. If you can elaborate on that, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>Also, I’m curious what your opinion is on the studies I linked to you in my second comment, and what your rebuttal is to the opinion piece (I say opinion piece because it is styled that way, as one man’s personal reasons why he isn’t getting the vaccine; however, he bases his opinion on scientific fact, so the categorization of that article is a bit of a gray area).</p>

        <p>I used that video because it was citable, and they showed their data, just how I said it in the post. You gave a video with no factual logic, reasoning, or conclusion that was ever based on the scientific method.</p>
<p>You can't understand how it relates? You seriously can't understand? You posted an article that said how they would kill you-- which they obviously don't, because people have gotten vaccines, literal millions have gotten them. You seem to think that the vaccine can be more dangerous than the actual disease, which is absolute idiocy in the pure form. Here's a little snippet of the CDC article explaining it(the CDC is the absolute best source that someone could give on anything medical science.)</p>
<p>MRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.</p>
<p>The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19.</p>
<p>This alone proves that all that your anti-vaxx propaganda is absolute bullshit, because it's from the God Damn CDC, otherwise known as Mr. Science wins again, you blundering fool.</p>
<p>The videos in question were a retort to your little articles that were ungodfully terrible, and I can't believe that you would ever use them. This person can't make sense of vaccines, which they explicitly said within the first few lines, and they aren't using science- -they literally said not to hide behind links in the name of science, so your fourth paragraph is useless.</p>
<p>And now after typing this all out, I think I could be the fool; not because of me being wrong, but because I fell for the trap of "You accuse I explain." This is we're you can simply make accusations with no real proof behind them, and then I have to explain with reasoning and logic on how you're wrong, and this will go on until I cannot explain how you are wrong anymore- - despite you being wrong every other time, and at which point you get the last laugh and "win" the argument.</p>
<p>So, I have an accusation that you must disprove: I believe that everything you say isn't in good will, but rather a ploy by idiots to make their own bias srem valid, when it is killing hundreds.</p>

        <p>Hey there. Did you know the pentagon are developing a microchip to help fight against the Rona? 🤣 Another theory coming true 🤷‍♂️</p>

<p>The major governments follow the same tune, that you can't see that is on you. Here's an article explaining conspiracy deniers like yourself</p>
<p>https://reportingforbeauty.substack.com/p/on-the-psychology-of-the-conspiracy-7ff</p>
<p>They will have to kill me, before I take the vaccines, the chip or wear a mask.</p>
<p>This is the most dangerous moment for humankind in history, and no - not from the virus itself.</p>
<p>Here's a Jewish child survivor of nazi Germany - drawing important parallels.</p>

        <p>You sure do like using articles that have no factual proof behind them, do you? Try using some citable sources, like for example a .gov, .org, or a .edu, and not a .com, as those are just random websites. Stop using youtube videos to prove your point, because they make you look like a moron... Which you are.</p>
<p>No, they are not making a "micro chip" that will brainwash you, as scientists don't even understand the brain enough to know what parts exactly go where, let alone fully control you. Technology that advanced and that small would be nearly impossible for us to ever do.</p>
<p>That second article is literal hogwash bullshit. If You paid any actual attention to the world around you, you'd most likely notice that intelligent aliens never came to Earth, that vaccines have been proven right, and that the Pentagon doesn't even have that much power.</p>
<p>On top of all of this you sound like a child with your random punctuation marks and incoherent sentence structure.</p>
<p>So please, wake up.</p>

        <p>LOL WHAT!?!</p>
<p>Ok dickhead. The first video is reporting on official data. The pentagon is literally working on a microchip to help "combat" covid. LOL you calling Tim Pool a conspiracy theorist!?!?</p>
<p>You absolute fucking bellend, the source is cited in the video. Have you actually watched it!?! The video isn't saying it'll control your mind!??? Who is the fucking child here 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>The second article is an opinion piece, how on earth would it be citing a .gov website or whatever.</p>
<p>You don't mention the third video/link I notice. Nothing funny to say about a survivor of the Holocaust drawing parallels with what's happening now?</p>
<p>Where have I mentioned aliens? Where am I vilifying <em>all</em> vaccines!?!?</p>
<p>Gaslighting, strawman'ing, bedwetting, troll - get the fuck out of here</p>

        <p>Sure thing. He is an athelte that ran 6.224 miles, or 10,000 meters for my non-Americans, while wearing a mask... On top of having asthma, which proves that people are lying when saying they can't breath in one.</p>

        <p>Why? Is it because you refuse to listen to basic safety instructions given by the MOPP system, the CDC, and the fact that surgeons wear them during almost all surgical procedures to prevent diseases from spreading? Are you that condescending that you wish to give others worry that you may be carrying a disease?</p>
