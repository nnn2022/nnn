    <strong>What keeps you guys plugging along in a world that has gone to hell?</strong>
    <p><p>The world is going to hell in a hand basket, there is no denying that. I am trying to come to terms with this. I am mostly okay with it. But I want to purge the dark thoughts from my mind and be okay with the demise. It would be better off for my mental wellbeing. I don’t think a civil war is going to happen or anything like that. I am done being angry, depressed about what I thought life would be by now. I’m 25, live in the US.. I just want to live my life because I cannot control any of what is happening. </p>
<p>Luckily I am self employed. So I do not have to deal with most of the bullshit that goes on in normal work settings... the bureaucracy, the political correctness, etc. </p>
<p>How do you guys keep on keeping on and stay sane? Anyone who has gone deep down the rabbit hole will know what I mean.</p></p>
