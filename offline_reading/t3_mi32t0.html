        <p>Yup. I've already posted this on other threads but it should be shared</p>
<p>Politically motivated and funded research is not in any way the same as objective scientific research. Most seem to recognize that politics are playing a role in the covid pandemic and reactions to it, yet they choose to deny that the science has been changed to fit political agendas. However, there are clear instances of this happening, whether the changes are for profit or to save one’s career is what we cannot know. Believing these overnight 180s in scientific outcomes, and ignoring the role politics play, is akin to biologists saying Creationism is suddenly proven over evolution, right after mass Young Earth Creationist funding, and people just accepting it as true!  </p>
<p>The best example is the very NEJM article I have been referencing, one of the most reputable sources. In July 2020 the authors made this statement: </p>
<p>&rt;"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong>"  </p>
<p>But what were the actual findings regarding masks OUTSIDE a health care facility?  </p>
<p>&rt;"We know that <strong>wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection</strong> from infection... The <strong>chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.</strong> In many cases, the <strong>desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>... Focusing on universal <strong>masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures</strong>... It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that <strong>fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....."</strong> </p>
<p>Does this sound like a push for masking outside of health care facilities? Or even really in them aside from their symbolism? This is nothing but a blatant contradiction of their findings to save their careers in our cancel culture.  </p>
<p>Another example of this horror is an article on why facemasks don't work by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC. He concluded:  </p>
<p>&rt;"Literature reviews have confirmed that <strong>wearing a mask during surgery has no impact whatsoever on wound infection rates during clean surgery... No matter how well a mask conforms to the shape of a person’s face, it is not designed to create an air tight seal around the face... a study of eight brands of face masks found that they did not filter out 20-100% of particles</strong> ... etc."  </p>
<p>Yet if you don't have an archived link, here is what you now see:  </p>
<p>&rt;"If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, <strong>it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</strong>"  </p>
<p>Our "current climate" is one that prefers fear over fact, control over science and reason, submission over freedom</p>

        <p>This is while they were still rational and not trying to scare people inside. How incredibly sad that common sense has left some folks, probably for good.</p>
