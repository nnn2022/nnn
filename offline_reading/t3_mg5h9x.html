    <strong>Only Covid deaths cause "stress" in Colorado. The other 37K deaths each year don't matter and don't cause any stress.</strong>
    <p><p>"In December, the emotion Alderfer had stored away for nine months  “leaked out” after losing someone she knew to COVID-19. She took a week  off and spent the first couple days in bed, crying and journaling.  Eventually, she returned cooking and walking her dog."</p>
<p>The 37K other Deaths don't bother her, only Covid cause she apparently never knew anyone who died of Cardiovascular disease, cancer, car accidents or suicide, only covid.</p>
