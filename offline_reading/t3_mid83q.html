        <p>The bootlickers will say we need to protect everybody by wearing masks and staying home. But those same people never talk about the obesity ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù that‚Äôs been going on for years... This stuff is really getting insane. My favorite barber shop is permanently closed now and I haven‚Äôt been to a concert in over year because of a low mortality virus that only affects the fatties and obeasts. </p>
<p>My friend in Stavanger, Norway recently received their deadline to get vaccinated before getting fines and possible jail time. We need to fight Tyranny wherever we see it, and shut it down quick.</p>

        <p>To be fair, the case fatality rate for coronavirus is moderately higher than other communicable diseases such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, rotavirus, hepatitis a, etc. etc. </p>
<p>But anyone who denies the \~99% survival rate is just plain out wrong. Case fatality rate is currently 1.8% in the U.S. and has been stable for several months now, so it is likely going to be equal to the infection fatality rate.</p>

        <p>You are right.  But let's see how we got to 99.9%.  In the start, they said it was like 2% death rate.  I know you hate the govt for not being able to tell the future and know the number was wrong, but they aren't as magical as you.  The virus seemed like it was spreading fast (their crystal ball was in the shop).  </p>
<p>scenario - left untouched, the virus will eventually ripple through 80% of the population.  Do the quick math.  80% of 7 billion is 5.6 billion people will get it, and 2% of that is 112 million people will die.  Holy shit.  In the US, it's 5.12 million dead.  They didn't know it effected old people mainly.  They were just trying to get proper testing for it.  And again, you should have been in charge, cause those scientists don't know, you do.  You should have designed the tests.  </p>
<p>Things we learned later down the path.   Maybe 50% of those that have it aren't symptomatic.  Surface contamination is very rare.  80% of deaths are over 70 years old.  Contamination is uncommon in the open air. MASKS WORK (so easily told by the decline  in flu cases.).  75% of fatality was cut just by turning the patient on their stomach.  People with vitamin d deficiencies did poorly with covid.  Fat people did poorly with covid.  Zinc was a big help in treating the patients.</p>
<p>If the govt did what you guys think they should have done then, and not even a worse case scenario.  Maybe 1 million people dies in the US.  Double our current number.  You guys would be screaming about why did the govt do nothing etc etc etc.  You guys are contrarians. You just like to take favor in the opposite side of popular opinions.</p>
<p>We're going down a path that I nor most other people disagree with. The vaccination rate is climbing fast.  When it hits a certain point, then govt gives all clear and we open up again.  We are close.  If you don't want the vaccine, then don't take it.  Not all, but some of you guys make this your identity and that is so cringy you have no idea.</p>
<p>Edit: 75% decline in death rate from when the patients are put on a ventilator.</p>

        <p>So what value do you put on life? If a hurricane was coming towards a town and the government ordered an evacuation, would you go or is that infringing on your rights? If they said, "99% of you would survive this hurricane" would you not take any precautions?</p>

        <p>If they said 'ninety-nine point nine percent of people are going to survive this hurricane, so we're going to destroy your livelihood and abuse emergency powers', yeah, I would refuse to take those precautions. Also, false equivalency. A disease either does harm to a  lifeform, or it does nothing. A hurricane destroys everything in its path. And I do distrust governmental handling of natural disasters on the political end of things (Rangers, National Gaurd, First Responders are great). AND you can't drag a hurricane out for two years.  </p>
<p>And, actually, that sounds a lot like what some weather warnings we get up here are like. And yes, we do ignore them, unless we have some risk factor, in which case we go to a neighbor's house or something similar. Like an <strong>adult</strong>.</p>

        <p>It's just an analogy, I know it doesn't line up 100%. But, it's interesting that you said that a disease does harm or does nothing. What about asymptomatic carriers? And, let's ignore Covid, how about the case of Typhoid Mary. Would you advocate for her right to continue working, despite the fact it was proven she was killing people?</p>
