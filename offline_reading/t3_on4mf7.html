    <strong>Risk Benefit Analysis</strong>
    <p><p>Sharing my own RBA if it will help anyone else make a decision about the vaccine.</p>
<p>Benefits:
1a. Lower chances of getting covid
1B. Lower chances of getting seriously ill or dying from covid
2. Lower chance of passing covid to others</p>
<p>Analysis of benefits:
Mid 20s M, 6’0 215, decent amount of muscle but could also lose a few pounds. Athsma. According to a couple of the university covid calculators I have ~a 1 in 500,000 chance of dying from covid based on my stats (I couldn’t believe that at first either based on the media hype lol). Even if the vaccine was 100% effective, it would lower my chance of dying by .0002%, from .0002% to 0%. Hospitalization is 1 in 10000ish apparently.
Most everyone I know and interact with is vaccinated so if it works great I can’t give it to them and if it doesn’t work then I could give it to them either way.</p>
<p>Vax benefits = VERY LOW (for me, you gotta do your own analysis based on your risk factors)</p>
<p>vax risks:
Little to none, tiny risks according to media and top scientists of heart or nuero complications. Other scientists and docs (Malone, Weinstein Kulldorff, etc.) have had concerns about short and long term concerns. 400k adverse affects, 10k deaths in Vaers</p>
<p>Analysis of risk:</p>
<p>Due to censorship and deplatforming of opposing views from medical professionals it’s hard to know the risks. Certainly they may end up being proven relatively safe long term, but I haven’t seen anyone correct Malone, etc, only censor. I think the shame of being “anti-science” likely has prevented more people from coming forward and the VAERS # may be low (although obviously there are a handful of false reports in there as well). A lot of bad anecdotes coming from covid vaccinated sub.</p>
<p>Vax Risk = unknown, likely higher than stated by media</p>
<p>Very low reward, unknown risk to me is a no brainer</p></p>

        <p>1 and 3 aren't real.  None of the vaxes claim to do that, they only allegedly reduce the risk of dying.  Which is already .00001%</p>

        <p>And to try to push this onto kids is so insane to me </p>
<p>It's one thing to experiment this new technology on adults but to try it on kids surely must be out of the question.</p>

        <p>Taking US data. Appox 55% with at least one dose, so around 180 million with MRNA. 10k deaths and possibly even up to 50k from the vaccine. 500k reported adverse effects. </p>
<p>No known long term effects. </p>
<p>Not fully tested on animals. I heard some tests were done but too many animals died so they stopped. I can’t provide the source.</p>
<p>Then we can get into the censorship and propaganda.</p>
<p>Just for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate on the slim chance you catch it. </p>
<p>That’s a big NO THANKS with my RBA</p>
