        <p>&rt; But Hota says anything short of drastic restrictions now will once again fall short of addressing a second wave that is quickly on the verge of getting out of control in hospitals.</p>
<p>&rt; She acknowledges that's a lot to ask, given that people have already been told to stay home for almost a year at this point. But the reality, she said, is it's going to take more than just a four-week circuit breaker-type lockdown to turn things around.</p>
<p>&rt; Making it work requires providing very clear advice on what is allowable and what's not, she said.</p>
<p>&rt; "If we choose not to, then we have to live with this, which is not sustainable from my perspective."</p>
<p>&rt; The key as Dhalla sees it, is to better apply all that we have learned in the past 10 months so we can contain the pandemic once and for all.</p>
<p>&rt; "Then, we can manage sporadic, local outbreaks the way they are managed in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, all while we continue to vaccinate people as fast as we can."</p>
<p>I got downvoted to oblivion today for saying that Biden (and these other politicians) are gunning for super strict lockdowns. This is their plan. They and their panel of "experts" keep blatantly dropping anvil sized "hints" that this is the plan. Do people, especially in this sub, really believe this won't happen? That they really are just going to re-open things "soon"?</p>

        <p>My opinion is that they will implement a bunch of measures that are meant to appear tough, but behind the scenes will ramp down the test cycles and eventually the test requirements (sort of how it was back in March, when you couldn't even get tested if you didn't have symptoms). They'll do this quietly so that people don't really notice, but it will lead to a natural decline in cases, not to mention that thee measures will likely be in place into the late spring which is when the virus will also naturally decline. </p>
<p>And after that, The media will make it look as if everything the new government has done has been fantastic and look it's reducing cases, go team, Biden administration gave you your life back, you have to be so so grateful.</p>

        <p>Sure, you might not be wrong, though I think they'll still keep things like masks and even further lockdowns on the table for the future even when they inevitably take us out of that lockdown, and they praise Biden and the other leaders as "heroes". They will probably usher in more censorship, strict regulations including health passports, and probably "reset" the economy as well.</p>

        <p>No doubt, pretty much expected to happen. </p>
<p>What's funny is they don't actually have any proof that people are disobeying. And how do you even measure that? It's nearly impossible to get an accurate read for that. And if you can't prove it and you can't measure it, then how in the hell can you possibly argue that it's the definitive cause of a problem?</p>
<p>I wrote to the premiere saying pretty much this - please provide proof for everything being our fault. Of course I won't get a reply, but the point is there.</p>

<p>Of course they do!  The rising cases are proof that people arent obeying the rules. If people were following the rules the cases wouldn't be rising!</p>
<p>Simple!</p>
