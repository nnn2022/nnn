    <strong>As this sub grows, we need to make sure it doesn’t morph into an actual r/conspiracy-like ridiculous sub</strong>
    <p><p>I suspect this will ruffle some feathers but it’s true.</p>
<p>What I like about this sub is that it’s full of reasonable discussion about how disproportionate the solution is for the problem. How ridiculous lockdowns are and how they’re destroying society, both short and long term.</p>
<p>We talk about children missing out on schooling, the mask orthodoxy, the media hysteria, the health effects of lockdown, governments slowly encroachment on our rights. All entirely reasonable things that are happening and should be discussed away from doomers who don’t even attempt to understand our point of view.</p>
<p>As this sub continually grows, invariably, so will the legitimate crazies on ‘our’ side (don’t act like all anti-lockdown people are reasonable).</p>
<p>People who straight up deny Covid even exists or that it’s an organised psyop by some shady cabal, devout Trumpsters that claim everything is a conspiracy from ‘the left’ and the Clintons, people who are legitimately anti-vaxx and say we’re all being microchipped and will all be autistic by this time next week.</p>
<p>I’ve already started seeing stuff like this, someone posted a video of some random woman outside an Irish courthouse saying the Irish government has no evidence Covid exists, her evidence? They didn’t respond to her nonsense FOIA request.</p>
<p>There’s also been some posts about the Trump supporters protesting and rioting in the Capitol claiming they’re anti-lockdown posts and that they’re on our side. Show me a single bit of evidence a single person was there protesting lockdowns. Those protests are nothing other than legitimate sore losers trying to usurp democracy and keep Trump in power, nothing else. Never mind all the weak ‘evidence’ (if you can even call it that) presented in court has already been thrown out. They’re not living in reality at this point. They’re literally just Trump versions of doomers.</p>
<p>By stopping posts like these from having a place on this sub, we’re not ‘against freedom of speech’, we’re simply keeping the sub on topic and weeding out <em>legitimate</em> disinformation and conspiracy nonsense.</p>
<p>Nothing is worse than when subs like these get big and begin to invite the ‘blame the Clintons’, ‘the Jews did this’, ‘Trump is playing 4D chess’ crowd. As it stands, we’re a legitimate sub. If these people aren’t weeded out as and when they begin to appear, we devolve to become a Trumpster and r/conspiracy-like circlejerk.</p>
<p>Please, mods, just keep this sub reasonable as we get bigger. I love the discussion on here but the day every post somehow ends up being linked to Trump, or are ‘articles’ from websites like covidfalseflag.wordpress.com, you’ll lose all legitimacy.</p></p>

        <p>I agree in principle, but many loopy anti-scientific conspiracy theories (e.g. COVID being in Europe in September last year; COVID being artificial; COVID being affected by warm weather; COVID vaccine success being tracked with chips) turned out to be true - or at least gained serious traction among officials. How would this account for that?</p>

        <p>Most "conspiracy theorists" forums are intelligent people discussing things to find out the truth. If you are ignorant of the research that goes behind the"theories", then you are premature in forming an opinion of them. If you are new to the discovery that the news is all lies and agenda when it comes to covid, don't be so quick to dismiss their other lies, until you have researched them yourself. The consequences of this "pandemic" being planned, go pretty deep, and maybe you are due for more awakening</p>

        <p>There's been four posts by four different users today advocacting for this sub to stop catering to "conspiracies", and basically censor this content.</p>

        <p>I'd have liked this sub to be like that because ongoing impacts of lockdown are broader than what's covered by r/lockdownscepticism, and political opportunism in a genuine crisis is distinct to massive overarching conspiracy. But, well, the sub has at best two very different directions...</p>
