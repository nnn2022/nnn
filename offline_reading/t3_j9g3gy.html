    <strong>Social distancing is the most indefensible aspect of these lockdowns by FAR.</strong>
    <p><p>I can understand, within the realm of reason, why so many people ask for the mandatory wearing of face masks, but I will never be able to understand why social distancing is required on top of that. If everyone within a crowd of people is wearing a mask, they should be able to stay together without having to bring out a yard stick to make sure they're not closer than six feet from each other.</p>
<p>I've been under the impression that wearing face masks significantly reduces one's chances of spreading the virus should they have it. If that's the case according to all these unnamed experts, then why do I have to socially distance around people, provided that we all wear masks and aren't locking lips with one another?</p>
<p>It's such an arbitrary, vaguely-defined call to action, and the logic behind it could be applied to just about anything dangerous that could ever happen to anyone. According to the CDC, "social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home". Well, yeah, of course sitting inside all day like a hermit limits your chances of being infected or infecting others, just like sitting inside all day prevents me from getting run over by a car, or being shot by somebody, or getting struck by lightning. Additionally, they claim that "keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread in communities". Yeah, much like keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to not be the victim of some gun-toting thug, or to not get clawed at by some feral animal passing by, and contract rabies as a result.</p>
<p>I feel like the proper "social distancing" precautions were taught to us since childhood. Even before COVID-19, in most institutions of learning, from elementary school to college, we were taught to stay indoors and not to go to school if we were sick or coming down with a nasty cold, but if we WEREN'T sick, we should go to school physically and not worry about it because nobody's sick! And even if they do end up getting sick anyways because someone was "asymptomatic", who cares? Just tell them to go home abd wait it out like everyone's been taught from the beginning of their lives up until now!</p>
<p>The point I'm trying to make is that this social distancing garbage is very telling of how all-encompassing some people think this virus is. I would honestly support a mask mandate for the time being if it meant we could rid ourselves of this social distancing forever, but I think it's to be expected at this point that they'll mandate both just for good measure.</p>
<p>Mask wearing, while inconvenient, hardly effective and sometimes dangerous in its own right, is not nearly as indicative of the "new normal" as the concept of social distancing is. The only people who ought to social distance are those who are sick, which is something we've been taught to do since childhood anyways. Sometimes, it's the things you can't see that are worse than the things you can see, and this unfair social distancing mandate is a clear example of that.</p></p>

        <p>I hate when people say "It's so SIMPLE! Just wear a mask, social distance and wash your hands!" Because "social distancing" is in no way "simple" or "easy" the way it has been defined - stay 6 feet away from anyone not in your household for months or years on end. In practice this would mean: no school, no sports for kids or adults, no parties, no concerts, no theater, no festivals, no theme parks, no weddings, no funerals, no Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, no church, no clubs, no AA meetings or support groups, no hugging, no dating or hooking up.... just a super abnormal solitary life (and eventually the human race would die out.)</p>

        <p>Not sure if true of course but there‚Äôs an MD doctor that worked in the military who said the 6ft social distancing bullshit has to do with tracking technology that‚Äôs limited to about 6ft. So they can‚Äôt pick one individual out of a packed crowd of people (think Times Square on New Year‚Äôs Eve) but... if everyone stands 6ft apart then it‚Äôs easier to track.</p>

        <p>I actually think social distancing is more helpful than wearing masks (and less annoying). I naturally will stand quite far away from someone else anyway, especially someone I don't know.</p>
<p>Virus cases went down in Ontario when we started social distancing, but it seems like masks didn't do anything or might've made the spread worse.</p>

        <p>Read: <strong>Social</strong> distancing. Not Physical distancing, but Social distancing. No talking, no communicating, no sharing thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>They want you to be isolated and divided. Something is seriously going wrong with the rulers and lot of people were at their wits end in regards to them.</p>
<p>Enter Social distancing. BLM protests being accepted can be explained by this too. BLM protests divide people racially.</p>
<p>Ultimately they want millions of people segregated into hundreds of thousands of groups so elites won't feel threatened.</p>

        <p>To me its the opposite though I am not one who likes people that much. I hate the capacity limits and outside lines. </p>
<p>Masks are a sign that things are not OK. That we are unsafe. That this is not over. I think it is madness that people think they can reopen the economy by using masks. Just their presence discourages consumer spending and encourages just bare survival.</p>

        <p>I can understand that, but even if we have to wear masks all the time, at least it's for everyone and not just a small, unlucky minority. You still get to go around with friends and be near those you love despite the fact that you may need to wear this mask.</p>
<p>Social distancing, on the other hand, is something I have thus far only seen as something that brings us further and further apart from those we love. Even if we didn't have to wear masks so long as we socially distanced, that would not be okay to me. It basically means that instead of suffering through this pandemic together, as one, we have to suffer through it alone. I can only imagine how many dying family members have been seperated from their loved ones forever during their time in a hospital because of the concept of social distancing.</p>
<p>Nothing to me screams "new normal" more than the idea of being forced to die alone, or being forced not to interact with anyone besides in the most impersonal, hermetic manner possible. I can wear face diapers for years if necessary, but I can never recover the time I lost with friends and family because of people who don't care about me telling me that I can't be near others without making them sick, no matter what else I do to prevent the virus from spreading.</p>

        <p>The 6 foot social distancing thing is in the Talmud.</p>
<p>Have you ever read the Talmud?</p>
<p>If people think there are terrible things in the Bible, the Talmud is a million times worse.</p>
<p><strong>CLEANSING OF THE LEPER</strong></p>
<p><em>Mosaic Law</em></p>
<p>"<em>In the book of Leviticus, God gave the Israelites guidelines for controlling the disease of leprosy. God provided guidelines in Leviticus 13-14 which would help the priests identify leprosy and know how to respond if and when the man or woman was healed.</em></p>
<p><em>When leprosy was identified in a man or woman, he or she had to live alone (Leviticus 13:46). According to Josephus, Jewish lepers were expelled from the city (Josephus, Flavius. The Wars of the Jews 5.227). Everywhere they went they had to shout out loud, ‚ÄúUnclean, unclean!‚Äù (Leviticus 13:45). The Talmud required that a leper had to stay six feet (1.8 m) away from other people and 150 ft (45.6 m) when there was wind. According to the Mishnah, anyone who touched a leper, was near a leper, touched anything that a leper had touched, or entered his/her home was ceremonially unclean (Neusner, Jacob. The Mishnah pp. 997-1009). As a result the Jewish rabbis avoided lepers.</em></p>
<p><em>It must have been a lonely and a very emotionally painful life for a leper. Imagine the pain that would have occurred when a father or a daughter became a leper and was excluded from the city. How would you feel if you were a leper? How did parents, a wife, or the children feel when they had to talk to a family member six feet way? Also, it must have been difficult to buy goods from another person. The person selling the merchandise would need to drop the item on the ground and then step away before the leper could go and pick it up. If there was a disagreement or a crime committed against a leper, did the local policemen ignore them for fear of being defiled?"</em></p>

        <p>I can understand that, but expecting everyone to both socially distance AND wear masks wherever they go is like expecting all GMail users to enable two-factor authentication. Even if you convinced most people that it's an advisable decision, there's going to be unease and uncertainty eventually, and that's going to culminate in people naturally breaking one rule or the other, or just ignoring them to begin with. </p>
<p>Maybe in an ideal situation where every single person on Earth sits inside all day for fourteen days, this virus would go away, but this is not an ideal situation. Again, I think the proper steps for social distancing were taught to us from childhood: if you're sick, stay home until you're better; otherwise, fair game.</p>
<p>I personally don't mind face masks, but social distancing, for non-sick individuals, is revolting to me. I'd gladly wear face masks all day if it meant social distancing would be soundly rejected. So much for being "all in this together"; we couldn't be farther from that with social distancing in place!</p>
