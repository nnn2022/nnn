        <p>Shit just got real. I'm so surprised that common folk are so dismissive of VAERS. To my knowledge it is literally the only reporting system in the US for adverse events around vaccines. People act like its some 3rd party website or something.</p>

        <p>It's because the VAERS data is practically irrelevant if you're trying to determine who died from the vaccine. It reports all deaths of people that had the vaccine, regardless of cause of death. Therefore, it is inaccurate in this specific use case.</p>

        <p>Massive increase in heart disease, suicides, drug and alcohol overdoses will be the most likely answer also they are fucking around with "excess deaths" by attributing anyone with a (most likely false) positive test at time of death, as an "excess death"</p>

        <p>To date the only true deaths found by investigation into VAERS reports were those from the J&amp;J blood clots, all others were unrelated diseases that cannot be caused by a vaccine.</p>
<p>Whether or not you believe in covid death counts is up to a person's subjective opinion on doctors. The CDC guidelines has a technicality where doctors can use their medical judgment to decide if covid caused the death or not. However, this is rare as only 5% of deaths are listed solely as covid (the doctor's judgment as explained above). However, most covid deaths follow along the lines of covid infection -&rt; pneumonia -&rt; respiratory failure -&rt; death, so it is fairly easy for anyone to understand how and why the death occurred.</p>
<p>In comparison to simple covid deaths, the vaccine symptoms and deaths reported to VAERS are all over the board, which is confounding because the process of these vaccines is very well understood. You would expect a relatively simple thing like a vaccine, something experimented, tested, researched, and MADE by humans, to have simple symptoms, so most of these in VAERS are ruled out to be temporal coincidences, especially when you consider how many doses have been administered (250,000,000).</p>
<p>Even if all of the deaths in VAERS were truly from the vaccine (which they aren't), then it would have a death rate of 0.0017%, significantly lower than the death rate of covid. And before you compare this percentage to your healthy-young-person death rate, please note that the VAERS symptoms and deaths are skewed heavily towards older people, just like covid deaths.</p>

        <p>In every blue state, yes all of them if you die and have a positive test for corona pre or post mortem, you count as a covid death regardless of the actual cause or manner of death.  I live in illinois, I fill out death certificates daily.  This is how they are being counted. I've seen suicides, over doses, car accidents, homicides, heart attacks and strokes all be classified as covid deaths.</p>

        <p>Thanks for lying to me, I know that you don't fill out death certificates because that is not how the state of Illinois counts covid deaths:</p>
<p>&rt;But the state’s death toll does not include people who had coronavirus but obviously died from something else, Ezike said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“As we learn more about the disease, there may have been less typical presentations of COVID-19 that were not appropriately attributed to COVID because there wasn’t a test done because the suspicion was not there,” Ezike said. “There [are] also some additional deaths [of people] who happened to be COVID-positive but the COVID infection had nothing to do with the death.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;For example, a death might be reported to the state and the death certificate might mention coronavirus — but when officials do a further review and see the person died from a shooting or car crash, they exclude that person from the state’s COVID-19 death toll, Ezike said.</p>
<p>Please stop making this about blue state vs. red state. Not every doctor in a blue state is democratic, nor is every doctor in a red state republican. Doctors wouldn't use their political beliefs to decide if a death was due to covid anyways, that doesn't make any sense.</p>

        <p>Funeral directors don't decide how deaths are counted... you may fill out a form for your company, but you do not fill out the actual death certificate itself. A medical professional does that if the death was at the hospital, or physician if the person died in their own home, or the county medical examiner. Not the funeral home.</p>

        <p>Funeral directors receive the death certificate by the state and fill in all the data at the very bottom, which details how the remains were dealt with and when. But they are responsible for making sure the entire certificate is completed by the various officials and for getting it filed.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your civil response. It doesn't sound like funeral directors make any decision on how cause of death was ruled then, they just make sure it was put on the death certificate by the medical workers. </p>
<p>If a person, like the funeral director, only sees cause of death and not the person's medical background, then they cannot say if the cause of death was accurate or not.</p>

        <p>Actually, if the funeral director has any concerns that something's just not adding up, she/he is supposed to report that to authorities. They're often the last line of defense.</p>

        <p>I would think the problem is with the standards set by the state. Early on, covid was treated (for reporting purposes) like any other ILI (influenza-like infection). The CDC has long accepted diagnoses of flu and flu-like illnesses without the need for testing, so when this came along, they treated it the same: if you had the symptoms and a physician diagnosed you, you had it. </p>
<p>Then, once it became a public health emergency, states had to decide how to keep counts, and a number of them fell back on the long-standing method of "if they have the right symptoms and a doctor says they have it, they do," and (if I remember correctly) Illinois was one of those states that counted you if "covid" was anywhere on your death certificate. Those standards may have been tightened over the past year, though.</p>

        <p>You realize it reports all the deaths of people that had all the other vaccines too. You would expect to see similar death numbers from all other vaccines if the deaths were just natural deaths but you dont.</p>

        <p>This is the first sensible comment I’ve seen from the vaccine-hesitant crowd all day. Thanks for actually giving me something to look into. A nice switch from becoming increasingly disheartened with logical fallacies and watching Lukatag getting downvoted for stating inconvenient facts or dissenting opinions.</p>

        <p>It’s accurate enough for them to halt J&amp;J vax because of it ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Not to mention you have to know you’re docs name, date of vaccine, vaccine lot #, date of events, ect.ect. It’s not like ANYONE can just go on there and lie, unlike the internet and/or media.</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>

        <p>Well the people who qualify to report to vaers are the "believes", especially the ones who went first that tend to work in the medical field and are thus more than anyone under a lot of social pressure to not leave a bad review.</p>
<p>Seems reasonable to assume that there's a high vaccine report hesitancy among these people. Who wants to admit they're wrong in public, it's essentially like saying your own religion isn't real. Plus people who die won't get reported if no one thinks to do it for them, and those that do will be stigmatized as anti vaxxers for even bringing it up.</p>

        <p>It's crazy watching people get banned from r/covidvaccinated for mentioning some side affects, even though they are the happiest ones to get it and still encourage others to get it despite the side affects. Can't let people know they are unpaid lab rats.</p>

        <p>It is crazy. You know when I came on to those boards, I was investigating the vaccines, to see what they were about and to see if I was too chronically ill to risk them, all the censorship led me to the conclusion of deciding HELL NO. [see my first submitted post here.</p>

        <p>Well, let's say we suppose for the sake of argument we've improved 10x since then and now 10% of vaccine-related events are reported. That's still tens of thousands of deaths and almost a hundred thousand hospitalizations. The same people who are pushing vaccines right now would have been downright apoplectic if we had those same stats for COVID and weren't completely locked down.</p>

        <p>I don’t care because I understand what VAERS is. Do you think it’s confirmed cases or something?</p>
<p>Per their website- "A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine."</p>
<p>Only an idiot would think these reports are proven incidents of vaccine reactions.</p>

        <p>No it hasn’t, what are you talking about? It’s always been a first reporting system as described above, and never has been used the way so many people here want to use it. Frankly the only people who ever used it that way were antivaxxers, medical professionals never used it that way because we know what it is.</p>

        <p>Did you read my post? No, it’s been operating for 30+ for medical professionals who understand it’s not <strong>proof of vaccine related injuries</strong> but instead a unrestricted reporting system for any possible reaction whose data must then be parsed to find out if those reactions were caused by the vaccine. Don’t take my word for it, VAERS says this explicitly.</p>
<p>Again, if you believe in the VAERS data, you have to believe the description of the data VAERS themselves describes. If not, you’re just cherry-picking from sources to confirm a belief you want to believe, which is obviously what you and others here are doing.</p>

        <p>&rt;No, hun, you typed a paragraph and claimed it was from their web site. I provided a link to the website that clearly debunks your made up paragraph.</p>
<p>“Made up paragraph”? Did you really not even look to see that it’s right there on the VAERS website?</p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/dataguide.html">"A report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described. It only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given. No proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for VAERS to accept the report. VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine."</a></p>
<p>That is a direct quote from the website <em>you yourself cited</em>. Is the website you’re citing not a valid source when it says something you disagree with?</p>
<p>&rt; You claimed its never been used to identify early warning signs for vaccine issues.</p>
<p>Please quote where you think I said that, because you must be confusing me for someone else as that’s a claim I never made. The point made by the quote from <em>your own source</em> that I’m citing is that <strong>these are not confirmed vaccine reactions</strong>. As I said above, if you’d actually read my posts- <strong>“it’s been operating for 30+ for medical professionals who understand it’s not proof of vaccine related injuries but instead a unrestricted reporting system for any possible reaction whose data must then be parsed to find out if those reactions were caused by the vaccine.”</strong></p>
<p>Do try and keep up, and here’s a tip; it helps to read responses before you write your response.</p>

<p>Aw, imagine being stupid enough to cite the summary of a report that the person who wrote the report disagreed with enough to correct publicly after it was released. Thank you for proving my point, if you had read the report, you’d recognize how absurd that summary was.</p>

        <p>Even better. This says ~3500 deaths from the vaccine. # of people vaccinated worldwide is ~291,000,000. Making the percent risk a whopping 0.0012% of death.</p>
<p>You people need help considering this 'source' provided by Tucker completely negates Tucker's own statement that the covid vaccine has cause more deaths than all others in the last 15 years combined...smh</p>

        <p>to people in the comments arguing shit:  </p>
<ol>
<li>"vaers lists any death as a vaccine death if they got it recently etc etc"<br>
\&rt;... so you're saying it's exaggerated. okay, sure. perhaps.<br>
but then so are all the other vaccine deaths. which are WAY WAY WAY less. this is NOT coincidence, fellas.<br>
PS: it's reported by doctors and the like..</li>
<li>
<p>"so few of them get actually reported"<br>
\&rt;.. so, overall, there are actually more cases of it happening that AREN'T reported  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>covid 19 deaths are reported in the same fashion that you claim the vaccine deaths are reported. which means you agree that the covid 19 deaths are wrong. for if the vaccine deaths are wrong, by the EXACT same logic, the covid 19 deaths, are wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>in conclusion..<br>
\&rt;vaccine deaths more than expected, due to possible other health conditions<br>
\&rt;covid 19 deaths more than expected, due to possible other health conditions</li>
</ol>
<p>but here's a logical fallacy.<br>
<code>"so few of them get actually reported"</code><br>
<code>&amp;rt;.. so, overall, there are actually more cases of it happening that AREN'T reported</code></p>
<p>which means, that:</p>
<p>there are far fewer covid deaths than has been reported.<br>
there are far fewer vaccine deaths.. but they haven't gotten reported as much, which means that there should actually be MORE, which, logically indicates that the cases that ARE reported are mostly correct, whereas covid 19 deaths are almost entirely incorrect.  </p>
<p>sheesh. maybe try arguing about something you truly know about.  </p>
<p>covid 19 deaths are BS.<br>
vaccine deaths are mostly correct.</p>
<p>PS: this is without factoring in that THERE ARE OTHER VACCINES DEATHS LISTED!<br>
and THIS vaccine has more deaths than ALL of those.  </p>
<p>even if the entire site was 70% wrong, that still means THIS vaccine is worse than ALL of those vaccines. the only thing that would change is that those other vaccines would have less overall deaths AS WELL.  </p>
<p>Fact check that.</p>

        <p>I went to go complain about what I was reading on VAERS to a pro-vacc website, and their constant excuse is "statistical deaths", aka people that would have died anyway from just the normal death rates. All you have to do is read the symptoms, and more, to see the deaths were not normal strokes or heart attacks, that there was multiple things happening to the people who died in many cases. I have seen so much censorship and witnessing censorship for myself is woke me up and got me out of the Covid dream world [see my post history]. People who are getting side effects are finding that they are rendered voiceless. One thing the pressure to get these vaccines is building on people too.  :( I saw one woman post about having a miscarriage get censored on CovidVaccinated last night.</p>

        <p>I have seen so much censorship it's scaring the hell out of me. I keep thinking if someone goes and gets the vaccines and something bad happens, they are screwed, can't sue, will be told "oh you would have had that stroke, blindness, tinnuitis, anyway, rendered voiceless and you are in the position that you lined up. I think there's endless death and suffering not even being reported.</p>

        <p>I get the point he’s trying to make, and I’ll get downvoted for pointing this out, but the statistician in me can’t help it. You would need to compare how many people received vaccines in the past 15 years vs how many people have received the covid shot. The sample size of both the covid vaccine and regular vaccines would be greatly different. I don’t know which one is worse but I can say that this argument makes little to no sense</p>

        <p>Your comment made me immediately think, all school age children. So I did a real quick google search (didn't put much effort into it so take it how you will) According to childstats.gov in 1995 there were 19.3 million children ages 0 to 5. That year 96% of them recieved the polio vaccine. The percentage changes quite drastically depending on the vaccine, and polio was the highest. But that's just that age demographic.  I'm guessing the number of people that have been vaccinated in the past 15 yrs is significantly higher than this years.</p>
