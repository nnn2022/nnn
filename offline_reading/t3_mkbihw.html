    <strong>I feel like I’m loosing my mind questioning vaccines and the government and all this nonsense and I need someone to talk some sense into me or at least help me get my thoughts in order</strong>
    <p><p>I used to be pro vax then I was neutral then I was pro vax then neutral/anti for a while and then back to pro and now at anti. And I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole of COVID conspiracies and I don’t know what to think anymore. Do I believe the MSM or do I believe the whistleblowers and others who say something that goes against the common narrative? Am I loosing my marbles? Is everyone else loosing their marbles too? I’m slowly starting to prepare for the end times and my family is concerned and now I am too. Should I get the vaccine or no? I don’t really want to but I also don’t want to not get it if it really is the solution to end this. What does everyone else think? Sorry, kind of a rant and may be the wrong sub but ya boy is going crazy.</p></p>

        <p>I know this might not be helpful and you've asked a bit of questions but I will say this as I said to a family member, every medication that you take has gone through testing and is fda approved, this vaxx has not even done that yet, these are the trials before it gets approved or changed to be approved, why be a guinea pig if shit goes wrong, you're health is all you have</p>

        <p>I'm not anti vax by any means.  I got all my vaccines as a child and think nothing of it, but this covid vaccine I am very skeptical of.  It's not FDA approved and they rushed it.  I hate being called an antivaxer just because I don't want to take an experimental covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>Haha anti-vax. They made up a word and spent what, 15 years demonizing it and now it's coming in very handy, if it wasn't planned (I believe it was but to each his own). I share your sentiment about old vaccines though.</p>

        <p>Yep.</p>
<p>I think the struggle comes with the narrative that is being pushed: anyone who does not want to take this experimental vaccine is an anti-vax but job.  There's no room for discussion.  The reality is, you have some anti-vaxers and a lot of people who just don't want to be lab rats for big pharma.</p>
<p>To me, vaccines are one of the greatest public health achievements of all time, one of the few things in medicine that have truly benefitted society... And all of that has been completely bastardized by this bullshit.</p>

        <p>This was caused by multiple things, and vaccines (for a few of those diseases) were <em>one</em> reason. There were also extreme improvements in treatments, nutrition, and cleanliness. Dangerous contagious diseases weren't really worse 40 years ago than today, even though the number of vaccines has exploded. They <em>were</em> worse 80 years ago - when the standard of living was lower and we didn't have vaccines for the few illnesses that warrant it</p>

        <p>Honestly believe after a lot of reading that the past diseases have actually been mostly eradicated due to an increase in general health. Vitamins are much easier to come by for one and general hygiene both personal and environmental have come a long way since these older diseases were around.</p>
<p>Can't let vaccination programmes take all the thunder when nutrition and hygiene do most if not all the heavy lifting.</p>

        <p>Dude vaccines works! Check out Louis Pasteur he invented it!</p>
<p>BUT vaccines, like medication can be flawed and cause serious side effects.</p>
<p>That’s why there’s a testing phase and a approval process that take years. </p>
<p>The new vaccines for COVID are a new technology that have never been approved. </p>
<p>Not wanting the Covid vaccine is not about being antivax, its about not wanting to participate in phase 3 of the testing. </p>
<p>I am provaxx. I have taken many vaccines for travel purpose.  Im not taking this one because its not fully tested and we dont know yet about long term side effects.</p>

        <p>You are not alone. I was on a similar journey.  Having an awakening is a traumatic experience. You aren't fighting cognitive dissonance. You are waking up.  You're not crazy. Many scientists and doctors are coming out against not only this genetic experiment - it's not a vacs... and the germ theory lie the whole house of cards is built on, so don't get discouraged. Take some deep breaths and step back when you need a break to ground yourself. Learning the truth is hard and dysregulating.  I'm always here to talk if you need it.</p>

        <p>You're not crazy. It's a crazy time we're in.</p>
<p>My thinking is you can say "I am worried about this particular shot not having enough testing" without having to be pro-vax or anti-vax. "I am going to wait and see how it goes for people" is a completely rational response to all the conflicting opinions out there. Keep doing research, and trust that eventually the right answer will appear clear to  you.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Also, I don't know what you're doing to prepare for the end times, but please try to spend some time enjoying today also, ok? If it was the end times, would you want to have spent every day all day in a bad mood? I think balance is the key.</p>

        <p>Not all 'vaccines' are created equal.  Don't fall into the pro/anti trap.   </p>
<p>If you don't like peanut butter cookies, that doesn't mean you're "anti-cookie."</p>
<p>The mRNA shots are not vaccines.   In fact, the definition of 'vaccine' was changed in January to accomodate the new technology.   </p>
<p>The mRNA shots are still considered experimental and still undergoing trials.   They are only approved for human use now due to the 'emergency' of Covid.</p>
<p>Read and understand the technology.   How it reprograms your own cells to produce spike proteins.   Look at the side effects on VAERS data.   Look at your own risk of dying from Covid.   Then decide which is more dangerous.</p>

        <p>there are so called "slow juicer" what work with less rotations per minute therefore helping to get more of the essential stuff from vegetables/fruits into the juice ... but the highest way I guess would be to simply chew the stuff ... as with mastication, with slow and appreciating mastication
the saliva can do all kinds of gentle unlocking of foods vitality ... </p>
<p>http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47026</p>
<p>is a most fascinating read in that direction</p>
<p>also I saw you like to eat probiotic foods ... what I can recommend from my own experience is to do some culturing fermenting oneself ... in these times when so many people live in fear of our smallest fellow children of planet earth ... the virus and bacteria ... it gives me so much strength and confidence to look after these 12 boxes I have now in my fridge with several sorts of oat, potato, carrot etc. being digested by brie/camembert/roquefort styled molds</p>
<p>I have one ball made from rejuvelac soured oats what has been given some cowmilk gorgonzola cheese into as a mold provider ... its now over 80 days old ... and the smell ... when I open it in the morning ... its like aromatherapy ... I am so happy with that hobby, it lets me sail the microcosmos and hunt for smells and taste experiences as treasures</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/mgl723/if_i_only_could_share_with_you_the_smell_on_this/</p>
<p>oh and this one ...</p>
<p>when I saw this one:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZu8FLjitos</p>
<p>yesterday ... I was so thankfull ... it made me feel so hopeful for us humans ... seing a fellow human being having such trust in wild nature that it wants the maple leafs to bless its steamed beans</p>

An exception should be made for super frail or immunosuppressed individuals for whom the benefits of the shot may outweigh the risks.</p>

        <p>Forget about non-covid vaccines for now. The covid vaccines are the latest experiment in untested medical technology with unknown effects. I'm not anti-vaxx, I even had one just a few months ago for Q Fever, but I am very wary of the covid vaccines for the aforementioned reasons. But these covid vaccines are pure sus.</p>
<p>Just chill, eat well, exercise, do your breath work, so that you're as healthy as you can be. You shouldn't need the vaccine, and if you do catch the covid, you should be strong enough to be just fine. Remember that the vaccines don't stop you from catching it, or from spreading it. </p>
<p>And don't fall out with anyone over this either. It's not worth losing your friends or family.</p>

        <p>if I may suggest ... unbottle it ... let it out ... write about it first for yourself, like a journal ... its part of mental hygiene to say the words what one needs to say to be free of them afterwards ... like ... it does not actually matter how many pairs of eyes do see a text ... if its only me who reads my journal, my emails I write to myself ( I do that a lot with the stuff I am not posting publicly ) ... the cleaning the relief happens in this moment when the fingers dance over the keyboard and the words appear on ones screen</p>
<p>there is also a technique for mental / spiritual healing to write stuff on paper and then burn it in a fire ... as to give it back to the elements ... dissemble the stuff what has caused blockages before</p>

        <p>Vaccines can be used for good, but there is an on going theme with big pharma to make money instead of help people, and if you see who is pushing these vaccines they are all globalists. If you look up the globalist agenda it's all about population control and the seize of power. Bill Gates himself has talked about population control through forced vaccination. These people are insane. However I always say do what you think is right for you. I would rather bring awareness so people can decide for themselves rather than push someone in one direction or another. I support free will. Do not be blindly obedient, and question everything</p>

        <p>This is meant to be neutral about non-COVID vaccines:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Vaccines currently available for every other disease are approved by the FDA. None of the COVID vaccines are; they're authorized for "emergency use."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID vaccines are still in Phase III trials. The other ones' trials have long been completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to this, the shortest time for any vaccine to be developed was 4 years. Flu vaccines (which aren't very effective either) were developed a long time ago and only slightly modified for new annual strains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can say no to all the other vaccines with few consequences, especially if you're out of school. There's some pressure from doctors and advertisements but you have full rights as an adult no matter what you decide. The COVID vaccines are being used as a means of control and depriving people of their rights if they say no - that's pretty bad coercion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>COVID vax = super sketchy, at best. It hasn't even met the standards that <em>every other</em> vaccine had to meet to be approved for general use. It's also clear that at a minimum, governments are abusing it for power and control, MUCH more than with any other treatment or vaccine. So for the pro-vax people, this one doesn't have many of the characteristics that inform that position, like completed animal and long-term human trials showing that it's safe and works well. For the anti-vax, this one is <em>even worse</em> than usual.</p>

        <p>I've had the struggle when it comes to vax. Every now and then I'll see and anti vax thing and see some sense and have to fight with myself, with the traditional vaccines i feel the benifits outweigh the risks and have gotten my childern theirs as they come up. However this covid one is a fuck no. Too many bad outcomes for me to even consider it, I've got too much to live for. I dont want my boys growing up without a mom.</p>

        <p>I am worried too. I go back and forth. I don’t want the vaccine. I am healthy, active, normal weight, extremely athletic, and under 40. I probably would survive covid. </p>
<p>But also, my businesses are in the large event sector, and I am going to Nicaragua in June. I want to re-open my businesses and I want to travel internationally. Will I be forced to get the vaccine to do these things? Is it worth it? I just don’t know</p>

        <p>I see the momentaneous situation as a " tip of an iceberg " thing ... like ...<br>
because so many human beings have for so long times chosen to go along with hierarchies and representative governements ... so many people have for so long times chosen to empower the medical doctors with their strong connections to the pharmaceutical industry ... to be appreciated by great parts of society as ... the experts ... in all questions of health ...<br>
we arrived at a moment where the dictate of an elected representative politician / governement employe together with the so called "expertise" of a medical schooled person ... corner the individual human being into a situation where freedom to choose what ones wants to eat, drink or otherwise ingest/inject into ones body is being framed as an irresponsible behaviour against ones fellows<br>
the coronavirus never was and never will be the enemy of a free human being who knows how important a positive connection is to all living beings, to be in harmony with the web of life<br>
so how possibly could we who live beside each other as neighbours and most probably have no wish to demand from each other to do anything what goes against our moral values ... how could we get rid of all this superficial hierarchic overhead what is trying at this moment to exercise some dictatorship / tyrant mode ... like a test run ...<br>
as I see it ... what would really help is to deconstruct the empire structure ... to flatten the hierarchy... no actually ... dissolve all hierarchies by decentralising distributing all political powers to the level of the local community<br>
and how could this be done ... possibly via a renewal of regional state constitutions as well as of the nation state constitution ...<br>
possibly using some concepts like:<br>
----<br>
the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community<br>
I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding, I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives<br>
I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else<br>
we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us<br>
to infinity and beyond<br>
together as one<br>
all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p>

        <p>every human being has spent 9 months inside its mothers womb ... it has spent this time listening to its mothers heartbeat, her voice and analysing all audio sources reaching it ... as well as experiencing everything what its mother experienced though the shared bloodstream on the deepest level, the biochemical cellular level</p>
<p>the newborn baby is at its peak of spiritual, mental, emotional and physical fitness</p>
<p>it possibly has all the solutions all the cures for all what ails humanity</p>
<p>but because most of human society is following the stupid</p>
<p>" I am bigger/older/richer than you thats why I will dominate you just because I can"</p>
<p>madness ...</p>
<p>many newborns state of existence deteriorates more or less quickly because its surrounding does not respect the newly arrived soul in a wholesome manner but seeks to vampirize its existence, suck the life out of it and turn a sovereign being into a dependant insecure willing to surrender and become a numb servant</p>
<p>what we experience since about a year now is just the latest attempt of overriding the growing renaissance ... the growing wish of more and more people to change our societal structures towards more fairness not only between us humans but also towards our fellow animals and all wild living ones</p>
<p>the coronavirus as well as all viruses and bacterias are messengers of the web of life, they come to our assistance, they want to live with us, on our skins, in our bodies to help us detect the garbage we have hidden, the stuff we did not bother to clean up, the rejected unsolved baggage we keep on lugging around in our spritual, mental, emotional and yes also physical bodies ....  keep locking it into dense clusters of cells what hinder the free flow of joy carrying lifeforce trough our systems</p>
<p>the moment we declare the coronavirus our enemy ... we miss the opportunity to learn from the virus ...</p>
<p>the more we use sharp liquids killing all the life on our skins ... the poorer our micro-fauna gets .. the less support we have detecting where all in our organs and joints and bones we have hidden the stuff we were too lazy to look at</p>
<p>seen from my viewpoint ... no human being has any authority to tell an other human being what to eat, drink or otherwise introduce into its body ...</p>
<p>wether or not I want to fear the little microbeings, the bacteria and the virus ... or I choose to see them as my allies, as my little helpers what nature has sent to me to improve my fitness level</p>
<p>my life, my choice</p>
<p>there are scientists who work to collect informations how beneficial virus are for us  -------------------------------------<br>

"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."<br>

<p>i was so happy when I discovered this article some time ago ...</p>
<p>since the time when I was a teenager and learned about peter duesberg trying to share with the world his findings that HIV is not the cause for AIDS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737">https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737</a></p>
<p>I felt that there is some gigantic corruption ongoing in our human society with the pharmaceutical industry and the medical doctors being in a most unhealty relationship making most everyone suffer from their virus scapegoating politics</p>
<p>the size of the global chemical industry is of such enormity ...  <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/</a></p>
<p>that it does not surprise when in 2020 and 2021 perhaps more than half of humanity is being handled like imbeciles ... most every human being on the planet being forced to wear an air flow limiting face mask, being forced to keep a distance to fellow human beings and most sadly ... being forbidden to move freely outside of ones home, being forbidden to meet others of ones liking    </p>
<p>what we are being exercised upon is a show of might ...</p>
<p>the centralistic political activists or elected governement representsentants working in concert with the pharmaceutical industry  <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html</a><br>
to undermine the self-consciousness, the self-worth of most everyone   </p>
<p>the goal of this evil plot of world domination by centralistic government initiatives controlling most everyones everyday lives however they wish ... sometimes giving a little more radius on the leash we are kept on ... sometimes tightening up the radius in where we are told we could move within</p>
<p>it is not the first time the chemical industry has tried to position themselves as the saviour ... as humanities only hope against wild nature</p>
<p>its just a bit frustrating for me to see how successful this all works out ...</p>
<p>like how many people seem to believe that their very own body would not be capable of learning from the coronavirus ...  that the coronavirus would be the enemy of humanity   </p>
<p>I would not have believed it when someone would have told me in january 2020 that soon the governements all over the planet would exercise emergency laws to forbid people to move freely on the streets, to assemble ... that people would be forced to obstruct their breathing by having to wear a face mask ... that people would be forced to provide their living address when visiting a public restaurant, a dancing club or any other social gatherings, that everyone at all times could be forced by governement threat of violence to test oneself for coronavirus and then being forced into self-quarantine or supervised isolation</p>
<p>i am still having a hard time to mentally process how so quickly the western democracies have turned into dictatorships where so called epidemologists set the pace of opening and closing shops, allowing or forbidding people to move freely, assemble freely</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret concerted effort of supporters of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to use the coronavirus as a scapegoat to train people accepting centralistic governement emergency law being used for prolonged times</p>
<p>...  wether or not there is a secret agenda hooking most everyone up to believe in the pharmaceutical industry being the only hope for humanity to ever enjoy free movement and free unobstructed meetings again</p>
<p>wether or not there is a money making motive behind all this or just a plain global dictatorial approach seeking much more than financial profits but finally to make most everyone give up voluntarily their very own freedom to decide what the want to introduce into their bodies and what not</p>
<p>its all much too much for me</p>
<p>but I am not giving up the good cause</p>
<p>I still believe that we human beings wake up from this nightmare and call them out</p>
<p>...  that we refuse to protect ourselves against the coronavirus, that we refuse to declare the coronavirus our enemy</p>
<p>imagine there is a war and no one volunteers to fight in it</p>
<p>but instead acknowledge all virus and all bacteria for what they really are</p>
<p>messengers of the whole web of life, carriers of important informations ...</p>
<p>coming to see us, coming to live on our skins, live inside our bodies to check us out, see if we have done our maintance jobs on spiritual, mental, emotional and physical cleaning ... or if they can find some deposits we might have overlooked, some trash we were for years shy to touch but have locked it away into dense blocking clusters inside our organs, our joints and bones</p>

I do still have hope that more and more people consider to stop using these biocides and virocides... these very sharp desinfication lubricants what kill all life on ones skin ... but instead trust more that the fauna on their skin will be so wholesome, so complete that it does not need so sharp and extreme killers   </p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people see the danger in us allowing the governements to use emergency laws for extended times to herd us however they want ... decide in dictatorship modus who can move how, where, when ... who can assemble where when with whom   </p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people understand the importance of our breath being unobstructed, of us appreciating the free flow of air into and out from our bodies    </p>
<p>may the deep peace of the free flowing air be with us at all times</p>
