    <strong>People aren't as brainwashed as it seems, they're just afraid of breaking the "new social norm"</strong>
    <p><p>I currently live in the Bay Area, one of the most "Covid conscious" places in the entire USA. As of a few days ago, mask mandates have been enforced again in all indoor places. Theoretically for a place like the Bay Area, there would be a ton of people who absolutely delusional and devout about mask wearing; they'd happily cuss you out, scream at you, film you and post on social media, etc. </p>
<p>These past few days I went to the gym, stores, and Costco all without a mask and no one told me to put a mask on, not even the staff. This was not what I was expecting. Six months ago, there were so many people that told me to put on a mask while doing outdoor hikes in California that I started wearing noise cancelling earbuds while hiking so I could just ignore them. </p>
<p>At the gym yesterday, a few people actually took off their masks briefly when they saw me not wearing one. The gym staff walked right past me several times and said nothing. A few people gave me a stare but then resumed doing their own gym activities. Last week, Zuby tweeted "I honestly don't believe that many people are still afraid of the rona. They are afraid of authorities and loss of accrued social capital if they don't keep up the charade of prtending to be scared about it". He is absolutely right, based on what I've seen the past few days, people do not care about Covid anymore. They are just afraid of being called out and labelled as anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-Fauci, anti-science, Trump supporting rednecks all grouped into one. In the end, people are not that brainwashed, they are just scared.</p></p>

        <p>Their insanity this year has legitimately made me distrust them to the extent that I question whether they are truly in control of their actions anymore.</p>

        <p>I realize now, how easily it would be, for any of my so-called friends to turn me into a government agency for things I have said to them in private. Things they have brought up recently, re: vaccines and shopping, which made them "uncomfortable."</p>
<p>If the gubmint applied enough pressure, they would all flip on me to save themselves. Those who desire safety over everything else can NEVER be trusted in a Totalitarian Country.</p>

        <p>This is why I don’t argue about my NNN stances anymore. Aside from like 2 true friends, I feel like the rest would feel perfectly justified reporting me “for his own good!” based off something I’ve said.</p>

        <p>Last week I went rock climbing at Planet Granite, without a mask of course. I get back to SF next week and I can’t even fathom having to wear one again while climbing. That shit is seriously restrictive to physical activity.</p>

        <p>Yeah I tried running on the treadmill with a mask on once and it's terrible. I feel more tired running 1 mile with mask on and 3 miles with the mask off.</p>

        <p>While my state and city haven’t reinstated a mask mandate (yet) my work is telling people “If customers come in masked we should all put one on real quick. It doesn’t have to be a big deal.”</p>
<p>The mask I was handed is still sitting where my boss put it and I noticed the majority of my dept not masking up.</p>
