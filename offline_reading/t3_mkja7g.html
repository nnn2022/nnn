    <strong>What is behind the crowded hospitals?</strong>
    <p><p>This is by far the biggest and best argument covidiots give everyone. "look at the hospitals, they are full, it's a huge sanitary crisis". In my country its the same thing, the hospitals apparently are all crowded and there are not enough ventilator beds to match the demand. But from what I see with my eyes and what I saw after finding this sub, I can almost safely say that this thing is nothing but a scam. But there is this one little thing that keeps me intrigued, the Covid hospitals. What do you think it's behind this?</p></p>

        <p>Well.. I have inside info from my country. Hospitals were NOT full. Then when they were, they were full of patients who didn't really need hospitalisation (All moderate cases were in there. Then they were empty again, and now are full of vaccinated people.</p>
<p>If I believe that, then I believe the situation is similar in other countries as well because I am comparing the narrative, the words being used on TV, it is the same method everywhere. I remember the war and the way the media was used as a tool back then to manipulate and control people. It is the same now.</p>

        <p>Depends on what country. If you’re talking US, hospitals were forced to push back their normal procedures to make way for Covid. This means some people weren’t getting that shoulder surgery right away etc.</p>
<p>The hospitals lost revenue and I suspect some, not all, held covid patients longer than necessary to make up for the lack of funds they would receive for the elected surgeries. </p>
<p>It also depends on the population. Some hospitals were full while others were ghost towns.</p>

        <p>In the USA, they laid off 1 million plus nurses and health care workers. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/08/852435761/as-hospitals-lose-revenue-thousands-of-health-care-workers-face-furloughs-layoff">Source</a>  </p>
<p>They also built field hospitals, few of which ever got used.  </p>
<p>Then 8 months later, when cases started rising, they immediately went into lockdown mode rather than doing a bit of introspection and understanding that lockdowns are a last resort and not having months to prepare for capacity.  </p>
<p>Hospital shortages can be explained by artificial staff shortage + unused capacity with a government that doesn’t see maintaining spare health care staffing as a solution. It’s just incompetent government all the way down.</p>

        <p>Hospitals are full because of politicians not prioritizing correctly. They're not building enough schools to train medical professionals and not building enough hospitals because of they wants to "save money" or spend it on something else. The overwhelmed hospital wouldn't even be a thing if they prioritized healthcare each year. In an area in Norway a hospital that were supposed to provide care of 600K citizens only had 11 ICUs beds. They were warned for decades. Did they do something with it? Nope. (Yes, a hospital having the responsibility of some districts is actually a norm there).</p>
<p>The US had hospital ships and a lot of other equipment available, but wasn't used.</p>

        <p>It's simple if hospitals were crowded we would notice it in our community. Busy stores would look dead. There would be less cars out. There would be way less people than the amount we are seeing now. I went to my local mall and parking lots are still stacked.</p>
