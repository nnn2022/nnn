    <strong>Mask mandates in the US decrease the daily growth in covid cases and deaths by 2 percentage points. Mask mandates themselves do almost nothing to affect cases and deaths.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm</a></p>
<p>"Mask mandates were associated with a 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) in daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1â€“20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8 percentage points 21â€“40, 41â€“60, 61â€“80, and 81â€“100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm#T1_down">Table 1</a>) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm#F1_down">Figure</a>). Mask mandates were associated with a 0.7 percentage point decrease (p = 0.03) in daily COVID-19 death growth rates 1â€“20 days after implementation and decreases of 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 percentage points 21â€“40, 41â€“60, 61â€“80, and 81â€“100 days, respectively, after implementation (p&lt;0.01 for all)."</p>
<p>This means that if daily deaths are growing by 15% with a mask mandate, they would grow by 17% without it. If daily deaths are shrinking by 8% with a mask mandate, they would shrink by 6% without one.</p>
<p>Lets use real world new infection and death data from <a href="https://www.statnews.com/feature/coronavirus/covid-19-tracker/">https://www.statnews.com/feature/coronavirus/covid-19-tracker/</a> to illustrate. We will be using the 30-day moving average of daily deaths.</p>
<p>30 day moving average of deaths per day today: 938</p>
<p>30 day moving average of deaths per day one month ago: 1744</p>
<p>average growth in daily deaths = (( 938 - 1744 ) / 1744) = -46.2%</p>
<p>So with mask mandates, daily deaths grew -46.2% resulting in an average of 938 deaths per day. According to the research linked, without mask mandates we would have seen a growth rate of -44.2%, or 973 deaths per day.</p>
<p>Mask mandates in the US brought daily covid deaths over the past month down from a potential average of 973 per day to the actual 938 per day. I will leave the reader to decide if mask mandates in the US are worth it.</p></p>

        <p>thanks for amplifying this. </p>
<p>always love the discussion which often nullifies the findings:</p>
<p>&rt; The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, although models controlled for mask mandates, restaurant and bar closures, stay-at-home orders, and gathering bans, the models did not control for other policies that might affect case and death rates, including other types of business closures, physical distancing recommendations, policies issued by localities, and variances granted by states to certain counties if variances were not made publicly available. Second, compliance with and enforcement of policies were not measured. Finally, the analysis did not differentiate between indoor and outdoor dining, adequacy of ventilation, and adherence to physical distancing and occupancy requirements.</p>
