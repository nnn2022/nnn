        <p>Because governments have taken advantage of and co-opted far smaller events to their own gain and to the detriment of the people. </p>
<p>And because your story is anecdotal; I prefer to listen to unbiased numbers.</p>

        <p>As a paramedic, you see more death in general than the average person. This is anecdotal and not reflective of actual statistics, not trying to discount your experiences but more people die every year of other causes such as heart disease. </p>
<p>I believe in trying to help people survive covid and think we should look more into treatment options and genuinely research options like ivermectin instead of immediately discounting the suggestion. We can also focus on prevention and encourage people to get healthy and stay active, as obesity is correlated with a lower chance of surviving covid as well as other respiratory illnesses such as the flu. We can do more to help the elderly and maybe keep them isolated if they choose to and be diligent about testing the workers working with these elderly people. These are all viable options but is not the route being taken by most world governments. Instead, they lock down healthy people and take away our choice and freedom for something that is very unlikely to harm the majority of us. Our health care system has been overwhelmed many times, often times from very serious flu seasons. This does not mean we should live in perpetual fear and lockdown forever. </p>
<p>Risk is an inherent part of life. We have been making our own risk assessments regarding our own health since forever. I take a risk every time I step outside and get into my car but it is a risk I am choosing to make. Some people donâ€™t like to take that risk and choose not to drive. That is their choice, but my choice should not be taken away from me. This goes for covid as well. What is the point of surviving if you are not allowed to live?</p>
