    <strong>How do I deal with not being able to do stuff anymore?</strong>
    <p><p>I am writing this on a throwaway account because I don't want to get banned from other subreddits. (Says a lot about how rampant censorship has gotten!)</p>
<p>I just got a text this morning from a relative who I was looking forward to visit saying that I was no longer welcome because I have not been vaccinated yet. </p>
<p>In a previous conversation, I told her that I was skeptical of the vaccines' efficacy and safety, along with how I dislike the manufacturers' impunity from lawsuits and the fact that the injections have not been approved by the FDA in full capacity yet. She responded by saying that the vaccines were safe, and that they would be approved soon. She also mentioned that she trusted it enough to let her kids of grade school age get the jab. She is a professor of biology at a renowned university, so there is some merit to her views, but it the end it was all pure conjecture.</p>
<p>What really perturbs me is that these medical treatments now wield the power to separate and create discord among family members and relatives. I've never had anyone act this way to me before; deny me from socializing with them because I had not taken some kind of medication or treatment.</p>
<p>This isn't the only problem that I'm facing right now; I have always loved traveling around the country and the world, and when I entered college I started saving up money from my jobs and my financial aid to fund my potential travels. Not only has the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns turned my plans into shit, governments around the world are now on track to make traveling especially those who are unvaccinated. South Korea enforces a 2 week quarantine upon arrival for the unvaccinated, and Malta is banning them outright. Many other countries are doing something similar. It seems to me that unless something extraordinary were to happen, these restrictions and bans are here to stay for a long time much to the chagrin of those of us who are reluctant to receive the vaccines.</p>
<p>At the same time, I have seen countless examples of those who have taken a vaccine and suffered enormous and devastating consequences on the internet, and occasions where simply the discussion of these side effects prompted immediate censoring and shushing up, which only serves to arouse my suspicion. That being said, my desired to be vaccinated (if I had no incentive to do so whatsoever) is 0. I consider myself incredibly lucky to be working a job and attending a school, neither of which are going to ask me anything about my vaccination status. </p>
<p>My question to y'all is: what should I do to reconcile my skepticism of the vaccines and my desire to go out into the world and do stuff? It sucks that my relative is denying me from visiting my cousins, and it sucks that my ability to travel around the world is going to be restricted for a long time, simply because I don't want to get vaccinated. Would it be absolutely ludicrous of me to abandon my hesitance and just get the vaccine to do the things I want?</p></p>

        <p>You're going to have to make the decision to be vaccinated or not.  It sounds like this just got sprung on you (family denying social contact, traveling etc)  A lot of us have been staring down this barrel for a while.  I'm in the same boat.</p>
<p>Don't know what else to say other than buckle up and sit tight and maybe take this time to develop being ok with being alone for a bit.  The only reason to be taking a vaccine should be to protect yourself if you feel that's necessary and to protect others - but as you can read the science around it preventing transmission is far from settled.  Talk to your relative about that.  Anyways, anything outside those 2 reasons is coercion of some sort IMO.</p>

        <p>It sounds like you're pretty well-informed; beyond that it's just about doing a cost-benefit analysis, which is something only you can do for you. Good luck.</p>
