    <strong>Make Plans for Elderly Family to Avoid hosptials.</strong>
    <p><p>My cousins grandmother is 93. She has been unwell for some time. Last week she had her heart rate drop so low her daughter living with her called an ambulance where she was taken to a hospital.  Upon arrival she was given a rapid results COVID19 test and was told she was positive.  The family could only recieve information thru hospital staff. The next day they were informed she was unlikely to make it another day and was unconscious and unable to speak.  One of her sons went to the hospital and did some asking around where he was told he was not able to go into her quarantined room but was given her room number.  He waited in his car til what he thought was shift change and then rushed to her room where she actually was alive, speaking and had her legs restrained to the bed.  She immediately said "get me out of here!" Security came and removed the son. But he called the entire family from the parking lot and more family came and swarmed the ward. After being threatened with arrest multiple times they were able to get her out of the hospital. She has since informed the family they refused to give her food, water or a phone. Evidently according to her at one point a nurse walked in while she was getting water from the bathroom sink and that's when she was restrained to the bed. </p>
<p>Of course a lawyer has been called. Local media was called but they did not bite. </p>
<p>My take - do not let your family go to the hospital unless it is absolutely dire. If your relatives are elderly or terminally ill, consider the state of hospitals right now and find out how the relatives would like to be treated should what seems like a health emergency arise. We have no idea if she is actually COVID19 positive. She is likely to die soon regardless. The family has been told that her positivity would not really matter in a malpractice lawsuit and that at this juncture the hospital was following state pandemic protocols on quarantining positive patients.</p>
<p>Perhaps i am preaching to a choir here but make plans now. We had another elderly relative die alone in the hospital, who had mesothelioma and was already dying at home when he had a fall which prompted a 911 call back in April. Come up with a plan with your extended families for your elderly and ill loved ones and make sure you understand their wishes as well.  If they are in a care home find out explicitly what the protocol is for C19 positive patients. Make arrangements if possible to have the family quarantined elsewhere instead of a hospital if that is the policy. Perhaps we are rounding a corner with the vaccine but this situation is simply to horrific to not sound the alert, make a plan for your family.</p></p>

        <p>I seriously had a friend with no medical experience decide to birth her daughter's baby at home because the hospital wouldn't let her be in the delivery room. She delivered a healthy baby, by the way. I have never been so proud.</p>

        <p>Just give out the name. Fuck that shit. Let them try to sue you for defamation. Have your grandma recite what happened in front of a camera in case they sue and she has trouble attending the court hearing as a 93 year old eye witness. I'm sure the jury would love it.</p>

        <p>I recently lost someone close to me and I was allowed to visit and come to the decision to take them home to die in familiar surroundings. I thought of how so many people don’t have that now. The pain from not being able to hold a loved one in your arms until the bitter end makes it difficult to find closure.</p>

        <p>our understanding with the EO pandemic legislation in Ohio that there is no culpable negligence for hospitals treatment of C19 patients at this time. so though your comment sounds hyperbolic to some, it seems to actually be the legal case.</p>

        <p>Yeah its not my grandmother. This is in-laws - which i also have really hated the anonymous anecdotes that have proliferated C19 discussions. Since there is also an attorney involved, even if briefly airing on the side of caution. It is in Northeast Ohio.  However, i think there is enough information here to get my key point across, which is this is likely happening on a wider scale. And that if you have elderly family consider this possible outcome.</p>

        <p>I’m going to say something controversial, but hospitals were always awful shitshows. It’s NOT UNCOMMON for them to restrain old people to the bed because they got  up to get a drink of water. Why? Because they don’t get reimbursed by Medicare if someone falls. The hospital gets dinged if someone falls. The nurse gets in trouble. They don’t have enough staff to ensure that everyone can ambulated safely (and this is pre covid), So old people are often unnecessarily sedated, medicated,  and restrained. It’s awful. In nursing homes, too.</p>

        <p>i am with you  - and despite having multiple family members as MDs or working in healthcare (i did as well for the last 8 years) - many hospitals are a shit show.  i think it is wise to actually get recommendations in advance of hospitals in your area if you are fortunate to have more than 1.  ask your PCP and anyone who you interact with works in medicine where they would go or take their child.  people in healthcare often have the non-public gossip/intel.  and as an aside - always get 2nd opinions.  the first time i was diagnosed with Crohns disease, i got a second colonoscopy within weeks from a different GI.  their lab and his eyes decided no Crohns disease but acute inflammation instead.  i am fortunate to have had the resources to pay out of pocket - which brings me to my 3rd hot take on US healthcare - doctors who work outside insurance, tend to be better.  my last 3 PCPs have all been membership based or concierge care, meaning they come to my house and did not even have an  office.  i paid on average about $500 for a visit that included lab work but the care is incomparable to what i have gotten using insurance.  i have the doctors direct line and the consultations are very personalized.</p>

        <p>I believe this. I have two stories similar to this. A few months ago a friend's mom went to a hospital for a procedure, they tested her for covid on arrival, told her she tested positive, stuck her in the covid ward straight away and told her she cannot have the procedure while she is positive for covid. She had no symptoms and was not sick.</p>
<p>No  visitors were allowed, but she called my friend and complained the nurses are mistreating her and not giving her food etc. My friend was asked for advice and I told her to take her mom out of the hospital ASAP by any means necessary because I have heard several stories like this already and they end with a completely healthy person with no symptoms who feels okay dying "from covid" in the hospital. Luckily she listened to me.</p>
<p>Another family friend works in a care home for elderly with special needs. Their policy since covid has been if any patient has a fever they are taken straight to the hospital covid ward and THEN tested for covid. The friend know that was wrong and when a patient had a small fever she knew he will react badly to suddenly being taken to the hospital (he gets confused and upset any time he is in an unfamiliar place) so she gave him a paracetamol from her own purse (because if she gave him one from the care home she would have to account for it) and his fever went down straight away.</p>
