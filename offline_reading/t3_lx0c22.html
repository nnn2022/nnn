    <strong>Doomer classification system</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Nine-year-olds:</strong> Largely self-explanatory.  Adolescent types trying to be edgy and smart sounding.  Say "lol" a lot.  </p>
<p><strong>Virgins, geeks, losers:</strong> Significant overlap between this class of doomer and the nine-year-old cohort.  Have no lives, are generally terrified of social situations, probably overweight, plays lots of video games, derive sick pleasure from dragging others down.</p>
<p><strong>Karens/Kens:</strong> Entitled, bossy middle class types, usually white.  Most of them are raising children, so they already had limited to nonexistent social lives before COVID hysteria.  Also, and probably most importantly, they have a stable source of income that was unaffected by the economic fallout of COVID "mitigation" policies.  Many of them have jobs in government or jobs that rely on government funding, so they actually benefit from increased government power.  This class of doomer is by far the most pernicious.</p>
<p><strong>Hypochondriacs/germaphobes:</strong> Were irrationally terrified of germs before COVID, have descended into full-blown neurosis since COVID.  Derive sick pleasure from seeing the rest of society mimic their neurotic behavior.  Make no secret of their desire for the "new normal" to become permanent.</p></p>

        <p>What's crazy is I considered myself a germaphobe before all of this. I'm the dude who watches people come out of the stalls after dropping a deuce and seeing if they wash their hands or not. I wipe down the grocery cart for that very reason to avoid puking my brains out 2 days later from some asshole who touched it and still had shit on his hands. That being said I now know I'm not a germaphobe, I realize that I've always known my health is MY RESPONSIBILITY and no one else's.</p>
