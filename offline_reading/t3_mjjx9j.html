        <p>Don't. Get. That. Shot. Trust me. Not everything your parents say is good for you. A lot of the things they say are but this is really not one of those things. You'll thank me in a couple of years.</p>

        <p>Fuck listening to parents when this shit is about your body. If I listened to my parents back when I was 280lbs I'd be six feet deep by now. Do you. Do your research and trust only yourself when it's about your health.</p>

        <p>"Don't change for anybody son." While I was chonking down 4 large pizzas, 3L of Coca-Cola and all of the other junk foods while being 280lbs. Now I totally flipped it. I workout daily, have a really healthy diet, take all of my vitamins and also workout together with my mom! Lost 80lbs, injured my knee and had 3 surgeries, gained back 80lbs, lost 90lbs again! If I could do it two times then everybody can. :)</p>

        <p>you can always get the vax later- you cant take the vax out once you get it. some things just can not be undone.   as a 16 yr old you have authority over your own body, a medical person should listen to YOU not your parent/guardian, so even if your parent makes the appt, and at that appt, you say NO, the dr/nurse needs to listen to YOU, not your parent.</p>

        <p>It is not our place to tell you what to do. However, if you ask us our opinion on the matter, we urge you to do your research.</p>
<p>I am not saying to take the shot or to not take the shot BUT do your research thoroughly. If you believe that it will cause you harm, then fight like Hell to not get the vaccine, but if you're convinced you should get, get it because you were informed.</p>
<p>Now, if you are parents want you to get the vaccine, and you are not comfortable with that, explain to them why, and explain it with evidence, and backed up with facts. We are not saying to disrespect your parents, BUT at the same time no one has a right to force you to put something in your body you are not comfortable with.</p>
<p>Good luck to you!</p>

        <p>I’ve collected more than 30 pages of credible sources here https://docdro.id/Qha02Wf hit them with the facts and don’t stop resisting. Also go and find the research paper called ‘covid 19 vaccines and the risk of prion disease’ I haven’t added that one yet. I already personally know someone who’s been seriously injured by the vaccine and I am telling you it won’t stop here</p>

        <p>every human being has spent 9 months inside its mothers womb ... it has spent this time listening to its mothers heartbeat, her voice and analysing all audio sources reaching it ... as well as experiencing everything what its mother experienced though the shared bloodstream on the deepest level, the biochemical cellular level</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the newborn baby is at its peak of spiritual, mental, emotional and physical fitness</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it possibly has all the solutions all the cures for all what ails humanity</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but because most of human society is following the stupid " I am bigger/older/richer than you thats why I will dominate you just because I can" madness ...</p>
<p>many newborns state of existence deteriorates more or less quickly because its surrounding does not respect the newly arrived soul in a wholesome manner but seeks to vampirize its existence, suck the life out of it and turn a sovereign being into a dependant insecure willing to surrender and become a numb servant</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what we experience since about a year now is just the latest attempt of overriding the growing renaissance ... the growing wish of more and more people to change our societal structures towards more fairness not only between us humans but also towards our fellow animals and all wild living ones</p>
<p>the coronavirus as well as all viruses and bacterias are messengers of the web of life, they come to our assistance, they want to live with us, on our skins, in our bodies to help us detect the garbage we have hidden, the stuff we did not bother to clean up, the rejected unsolved baggage we keep on lugging around in our spritual, mental, emotional and yes also physical bodies .... keep locking it into dense clusters of cells what hinder the free flow of joy carrying lifeforce trough our systems</p>
<p>the moment we declare the coronavirus our enemy ... we miss the opportunity to learn from the virus ... the more we use sharp liquids killing all the life on our skins ... the poorer our micro-fauna gets .. the less support we have detecting where all in our organs and joints and bones we have hidden the stuff we were too lazy to look at</p>
<p>seen from my viewpoint ... no human being has any authority to tell an other human being what to eat, drink or otherwise introduce into its body ...</p>
<p>wether or not I want to fear the little microbeings, the bacteria and the virus ... or I choose to see them as my allies, as my little helpers what nature has sent to me to improve my fitness level</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my life, my choice</p>

<h1>there are scientists who work to collect informations how beneficial virus are for us</h1>

<p>"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<p>i was so happy when I discovered this article some time ago ... since the time when I was a teenager and learned about peter duesberg trying to share with the world his findings that HIV is not the cause for AIDS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737">https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737</a></p>
<p>I felt that there is some gigantic corruption ongoing in our human society with the pharmaceutical industry and the medical doctors being in a most unhealty relationship making most everyone suffer from their virus scapegoating politics</p>
<p>the size of the global chemical industry is of such enormity ...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/</a></p>
<p>that it does not surprise when in 2020 and 2021 perhaps more than half of humanity is being handled like imbeciles ... most every human being on the planet being forced to wear an air flow limiting face mask, being forced to keep a distance to fellow human beings and most sadly ... being forbidden to move freely outside of ones home, being forbidden to meet others of ones liking</p>
<p>what we are being exercised upon is a show of might ... the centralistic political activists or elected governement representsentants working in concert with</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html</a></p>
<p>to undermine the self-consciousness, the self-worth of most everyone</p>
<p>the goal of this evil plot of world domination by centralistic government initiatives controlling most everyones everyday lives however they wish ... sometimes giving a little more radius on the leash we are kept on ... sometimes tightening up the radius in where we are told we could move within</p>
<p>it is not the first time the chemical industry has tried to position themselves as the saviour ... as humanities only hope against wild nature</p>
<p>its just a bit frustrating for me to see how successful this all works out ...</p>
<p>like how many people seem to believe that their very own body would not be capable of learning from the coronavirus ...</p>
<p>that the coronavirus would be the enemy of humanity</p>
<p>I would not have believed it when someone would have told me in january 2020 that soon the governements all over the planet would exercise emergency laws to forbid people to move freely on the streets, to assemble ... that people would be forced to obstruct their breathing by having to wear a face mask ... that people would be forced to provide their living address when visiting a public restaurant, a dancing club or any other social gatherings, that everyone at all times could be forced by governement threat of violence to test oneself for coronavirus and then being forced into self-quarantine or supervised isolation</p>
<p>i am still having a hard time to mentally process how so quickly the western democracies have turned into dictatorships where so called epidemologists set the pace of opening and closing shops, allowing or forbidding people to move freely, assemble freely</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret concerted effort of supporters of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to use the coronavirus as a scapegoat to train people accepting centralistic governement emergency law being used for prolonged times ...</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret agenda hooking most everyone up to believe in the pharmaceutical industry being the only hope for humanity to ever enjoy free movement and free unobstructed meetings again</p>
<p>wether or not there is a money making motive behind all this or just a plain global dictatorial approach seeking much more than financial profits but finally to make most everyone give up voluntarily their very own freedom to decide what the want to introduce into their bodies and what not</p>
<p>its all much too much for me</p>
<p>but I am not giving up the good cause</p>
<p>I still believe that we human beings wake up from this nightmare and call them out ...</p>
<p>that we refuse to protect ourselves against the coronavirus, <strong>that we refuse to declare the coronavirus our enemy</strong></p>
<p>imagine there is a war and no one volunteers to fight in it</p>
<p><strong>but instead acknowledge all virus and all bacteria for what they really are</strong></p>
<p><strong>messengers of the whole web of life, carriers of important informations ...</strong></p>
<p>coming to see us, coming to live on our skins, live inside our bodies to check us out, see if we have done our maintance jobs on spiritual, mental, emotional and physical cleaning ... or if they can find some deposits we might have overlooked, some trash we were for years shy to touch but have locked it away into dense blocking clusters inside our organs, our joints and bones</p>

        <p>I still do have hope that we consider the life affirming approach, one who appreciates the work of the bacteria and viruses like for example it is being supported by such great research initiatives like this one: <br>

And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role." <br>

<p>I do still have hope that more and more people consider to stop using these biocides and virocides... these very sharp desinfication lubricants what kill all life on ones skin ... but instead trust more that the fauna on their skin will be so wholesome, so complete that it does not need so sharp and extreme killers</p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people see the danger in us allowing the governements to use emergency laws for extended times to herd us however they want ... decide in dictatorship modus who can move how, where, when ... who can assemble where when with whom</p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people understand the importance of our breath being unobstructed, of us appreciating the free flow of air into and out from our bodies</p>
<p><strong>may the deep peace of the free flowing air be with us at all times</strong></p>
<p>but how could we actually change the circumstances, the political structure in a sustainable manner .. so that such a disaster could never happen again ... so that never again some centralistic oriented governmental agents could exercise such dictatorial powers</p>
<p>I believe for that we could try to improve our states constitutions ... aiming for a complete and consequential decentralisation and distribution of political powers towards the local level ... to the level where people are each others neighbours every day</p>
<p>I believe to renew our nation states and regional states constitutions could be the one peaceful and gentle change we could consider...</p>
<p>for example along lines such as</p>
<p>----</p>
<p><strong>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</strong></p>
<p><strong>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</strong></p>
<p><strong>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</strong></p>
<p><strong>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</strong></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community</p>
<p>I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding, I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives</p>
<p>I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else</p>
<p>we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p>
