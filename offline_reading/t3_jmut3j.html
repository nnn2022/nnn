        <p>We aren't here because it's fun, we don't want to be here, but tyrants in our government, and people like you who blindly follow them and cannot think for yourself have forced us into this situation. I am here to network with like minded people to stand up against the globalist conspiracy that is COVID, such an extremely deadly virus with a 99.84% survival rate, that we have to shut down everything for and give up our basic natural rights our ancestors gave so much so that we could enjoy.</p>
<p>Stop listening to the media and politicians, they all lie, their goal is push globalism and gain more power for themselves and the people who control them. You probably will not give me the time of day, you'll read my post, downvote me, and go back to watching CNN. But many years down the line, you will realize as you are either living under your new "utopian" world government, or living in a free world created by men like those of us on this subreddit and those of us who stood have against tyranny from the beginning, that I was right.</p>

        <p>99.84% Survival rate? What about the elderly, most vulnerable people that have died from it? You want more of them to die? Go back to Fox News with your precious little Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, etc. and gtfo of reddit. Everyone hates this subreddit and it will get banned in a matter of months along with r/NoMask.</p>

        <p>People are dying of starvation because lockdowns shut down the supply chains and food aid that get affordable food to them. People, many children, are dying of malaria and tuberculosis because those same issues have interrupted the flow of medicine and preventatives to them. Child marriages are skyrocketing in countries where that's still a problem. There are fewer early diagnoses of cancer. Chronic illnesses go untreated.</p>
<p>That's all part of the cost of lockdown and panicky unfocused "pandemic mitigation." It doesn't save lives unless you only count rich first-worlders, and even then it might not really save anyone.</p>

        <p>Including all cases of COVID, there is a 99.84% survival rate.  The rate is lower for the elderly as you said, but also much higher in young people.  And you know what, our basic natural rights are more important than life to me.  I'd rather be dead than not be able to speak freely, move freely, or have the right to own property.  I don't want the government to keep me safe, I can keep myself safe.  These elderly people you're speaking for, who says they want to live out their already few remaining years hiding away from a virus.  If I were 80 years old, I'd rather live have one more year of living life to the fullest rather than 10 years of hiding away waiting to die.</p>
<p>Come back here in 20 years, realize that you supported tyranny, realize you valued the word of men who simply want power over your basic natural rights you no longer have.  Enjoy your world government, enjoy it, as you are currently fighting for it.</p>

        <p>I don't want lockdowns, nor do I enjoy them, but it's the only way people will stay safe, something that people like you refuse to accept. Wearing masks and social distancing is the only way we're going to beat this, but you think spreading the disease like you are will make things go away. If people like you ran the world, the death count of COVID would be bigger than the count of world wide cases. Fuck off and go back to Fox News.</p>

        <p>That 31 year old woman was kept safe wasn't she, when they denied her her treatment because of covid. Im sure her kids will understand that covid patients were far more important than she was. </p>

        <p>It was wrong they denied her treatment, I'll give you that, but you act like just because someone has a deadly disease they instantly have to be the center of attention. They could of gotten people to help her, sure, but other people needed help too, and the same fate would happen to COVID Survivors in that hospital if they paused their treatment.</p>

        <p>I am not the one acting like a person with a deadly disease needs to be the centre of attention. You are! You are here crying about saving the lives of covid patients, while we are here trying to remind people like you that other lives matter and their lives are being dismissed because of covid. </p>
<p>Theyre pausing treatment like hers to keep the space free for covid patients. In the meantime, the nurses were doing dances for tiktok. The hospitals were not overrun at any point, there was and still is no reason for treatment like that poor womans to be cancelled. She is one of thousands. </p>
<p>So while you're sitting there thinking you are saving people, try and remember those who are fighting for their lives from causes that are just being ignored. Yes. Ignored. Then dismissed entirely by people like you who try to shut down those who are trying to fight along side them.</p>

        <p>If the borders weren't closed, and people "fought" along side them, that woman, who was already sick, would of most likely been infected with COVID and died, because she is already infected deadly. The Hospitals were not overrun at any point? You have absolutely no evidence to prove so, however I have seen THOUSANDS of news articles and footage of several hospital trucks loaded with COVID patients being rushed and loaded into the hospital. You think it's perfectly fine not to wear masks and social distance. You are the real "fascists" here.</p>

        <p>So you're saying her life was not worth saving, because she had cancer anyway. She was 31 and had children. Yet you think we are the heartless ones! Are you for real? </p>
<p>She was one of thousands. Theyre predicting over 35,000 deaths due to cancer patients being denied treatment. That is not counting the backlog of patients, or the patients who can't even get the cancer screening. 
This is also just cancer. There are many many other illnesses that are being ignored, which many of them are easily treatable but fatal if ignored. </p>
<p>The hospitals in the UK were never overrun. This is not just me thinking it, it is fact. </p>
<p>You can try as you might to make us out to be the bad guys here, but you haven't exactly painted yourself in a positive light.</p>

<p>So first, can you please explain to me, a clear science-denying dumbass, how masks work in preventing the spread of COVID? </p>
<p>I don't want you to just throw me a few links and call it a day. I'd like for you to break down the studies for me and tell me why they support their conclusion. You say masks cause decreases in spread, so show me ecologically valid rigorous studies that show such causal evidence.</p>

        <p>A lot of people here espouse the anti-mask sentiment, some don't.  Some people, like myself, agree with the rationale of wearing one, but think it's doing less than people think and that calling out people as being responsible for spreading the virus on this sole criterion is silly.</p>

Edit the economic world forum is real they have a website they have a youtube channel and they were even in the latest time magazine. They have been around for 50 years. This is real this isn't a conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this sub has a lot of BS on it. I'm not here for the illuminati-anti-mask-conspiracy stuff, I'm just looking for a place where there are skeptics who question the mainstream narrative.</p>
<p>I would like to hear more discussion and debate rather than just simple answers. E.g. What is the cost of the cure? Can it ever be worse than the disease? Are we there yet? How will we know and what should we do? </p>
<p>But instead, those questions have become value loaded. If I question the WHO I must hate the elderly. If I think that lockdown is causing a lot of harm, I must be purely selfish. </p>
<p>Like with most issues, I feel this one is completely polarized and politicized to the point that no one is even thinking anymore. </p>
<p>So yeah, if you know of a sub where debate and skepticism are allowed, let me know asap and I'll join it!</p>

        <p>It's pretty sad how my post wasn't deleted and these comments are getting removed by moderators. Even the moderators know deep down I'm right.</p>

        <p>Hiding problems doesn’t work. That’s life. You’re clearly young. Sincerely, please study hard and just know that everything’s gonna be okay. There are better ways for you to spend your energy.</p>
