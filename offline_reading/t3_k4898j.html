    <strong>Block Chicago Is Naming Names and Using Shame and Fear to Influence the Public Opinion.....</strong>
    <p><p><strong>I laughed at this article. Block Chicago is trying to use fear and shame!  Every day they are hitting people over the heads with propaganda and obsessively  fearmongering over Covid! It's driving me mad but at the same time I laugh at it because they come across like tattle-tails. Like they just basically snitch on everyone who is "breaking the covid rules" and tries to shame them. Including guiding quotes like:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Actions like this are a slap in the face to the thousands of  businesses and millions of Chicagoans that are making sacrifices every  day to keep our city safe, and we will continue cracking down on this  inexcusable activity,” Rosa Escareno, commissioner of the city’s  Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Department, said in a news  release. "</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Then they post all the people who are bad so that everyone knows they "got in trouble". It reminds me of middle school..... Here's more excerpts below. You can read the whole ridiculous article at the link at the bottom....Anyone else in Chicago fed up with Block Chicago's Cornoavirus-nazism?</strong></p>
<p><em>The city’s business department has conducted thousands of  investigations into businesses since the start of the pandemic. Nine  other businesses have been given one-day closure orders since the end of  October due to violating coronavirus restrictions.</em></p>
<p><em>Among them was the Chicago Sports Complex,</em> <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/11/02/the-city-shut-down-a-600-person-halloween-party-this-weekend-and-it-wasnt-the-only-huge-bash/"><em>which held a 600-person party that the city shut down</em></a> <em>over Halloween weekend.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Other violations, according to the city:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wildberry Pancake, 196 E. Pearson St.: Was given a closure order  for allowing indoor dining despite multiple notices to correct and  citations. Wildberry was also ordered to remain closed until the city’s  business department approves a plan for it to reopen.</em></li>
<li><em>The Ballroom, 6351-59 S. Cottage Grove Ave.: Was given a closure order for having a party with more than 200 people.</em></li>
<li><em>Fat  Fish Bar &amp; Grill, 234-236 W. 31st St.: Was given a closure order  for violating social distancing and face covering requirements on its  outdoor patio. Fat Fish was also ordered to remain closed until the  city’s business department approves a plan for it to reopen.</em></li>
<li><em>Black  Cat Lounge, 1640 W. 115th St.: Was given a closure order for having  patrons drinking indoors and for not enforcing face covering and social  distancing rules.</em></li>
<li><em>The Delta, 1745 W. North Ave.: Was given a  closure order for violating social distancing and face covering  requirements on its outdoor patio.</em></li>
<li><em>Mariscos La Diabla, 4222-24  W. 63rd St.: Was given a closure order for having patrons eating indoors  and for not enforcing face covering and social distancing rules.</em></li>
<li><em>Effe  Inc, 426 W. 63rd St.: Was given a closure order for having patrons  eating indoors and for not enforcing face covering and social distancing  rules.</em></li>
<li><em>Linda’s Place, 1044 W. 51st St.: Was given a closure  order for having patrons eating indoors and for not enforcing face  covering and social distancing rules.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>CHICAGO — The city broke up a 300-person party early Sunday in the basement of a former bank in Wicker Park.</em></p>
<p><em>The illegal party was being held in the basement of 1612 W. Division  Ave. — the former home of the Bedford, a cocktail bar. The “dangerous  and unlicensed commercial party” had about 300 people who weren’t  wearing face coverings or social distancing, Isaac Reichman, a spokesman  for the city’s business department, said in an email.</em></p>
<p><em>The Vault/All Access, which organized the party, received five cease  and desist orders; a closure order due to dangerous conditions, like not  having smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors; and nine citations  for violating coronavirus restrictions, not having proper business  licenses, allowing smoking indoors and operating sparklers indoors.</em></p>
<p><em>The organizers of the party could not immediately be reached for comment.</em></p>
<p><em>RDM Development and Investments, which owns the property, recently</em> <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/11/30/developer-eyes-historic-bank-building-near-division-blue-line-station-for-new-rooftop-bar/"><em>asked the city for a zoning change</em></a>  <em>to convert the building’s rooftop into a bar and restaurant. The future  tenant would occupy the rooftop as well as the basement restaurant  areas.</em></p>
<p><em>Kyle Sneed, president of the Wicker Park Committee, called the party “outrageous.”</em></p>
