    <strong>Spirituality</strong>
    <p><p>So, as you can see, I‚Äôm ‚Äúnew‚Äù to Reddit. I‚Äôve lurked for a long time and have had numerous throw-aways that I could never get back into after signing out. I found this sub about a month ago and am SO STOKED about it. Finally made another account after trying to step away from the Reddit hellhole. I wanted to say..... Power to you all from all walks of life, races, countries, religions, politics, age, genders, whatever! We are humans fighting for our right to be HUMAN! </p>
<p>Anyways, anyone else here into.... I guess it would be called ‚Äúnew age‚Äù spirituality??? I‚Äôm on a soul journey. A period of growth. It started before covid and got interrupted but I‚Äôve been catapulted back onto the path of healing, unlearning, and growing. I find it unfortunate that so many who are ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù their spirits and souls seem to waking up on a darker side with all the anger and hatred against white people and those of us against lockdowns, masks, and loss of freedoms. The way I see it, from a soul perspective, we are literally all human beings. I don‚Äôt care what the fuck you look like or who you worship or vote for, but I have a problem when those things are destructive to the overall collective of consciousness as humans. Those who claim to be ‚Äúwoke‚Äù are still sleeping and it is terrifying. The worst part is I see some of their points and agree, but they are so incredibly destructive in the way they try to move towards the change. We need to come together as humans first and foremost, laying down our swords and shields, and wake up and realize there is a much larger battle going on in the universe. I‚Äôm not sure how to get people to see it. The collective consciousness is raising, and it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people. It‚Äôs the people finding this sub and those who are waking up to the disillusionment of the world around us. Anyone want to add??</p></p>

        <p>I know this will come offensive to some but I am compelled to write this after reading this post.</p>
<p>The beginning and end of all "spiritual truth per se" is finding God, our loving creator that a hateful world is desperately trying to hide from us. The one true God of course, because there are many false ones. And Jesus Christ is only mediator to Him.</p>
<p>This rant may annoy some but take it or leave it, that's pretty much it. I wish you to find the sweetest honey that is God's truth.</p>

        <p>Totally.  I like how this sub can be a sounding board for people's ideas.  For whatever reason, it seems like text posts aren't very popular on most subs I visit.</p>

        <p>True indeed. But, no time to rest. Evil has it's schemes and plans to stop that from ever happening again, by punishing "thought crime", injecting humans with junk and by dimming The Sun. Let's hope humanity will reason and course-correct from this utopian trail, before it is too late. ü§û</p>

        <p>I agree!! It definitely isn‚Äôt a time to rest! I just don‚Äôt know what to do to be honest. There are massive tears in the bonds we should all have just by existing</p>
