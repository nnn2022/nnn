    <strong>My Grandmother and masks....</strong>
    <p><p>I take my grandma to the doctors about once a month because she gets wed amd injections in her eye for macular degeneration other family members used to do it then they stopped then choose to take a cab now I do  </p>
<p>Two times ago I noticed when I came in she was wearing a mask in her house and asked me do you have a mask I was kind of taken aback and said yes I have one if you go into a store and then we proceeded to go to the doctors and not go to any stores because that was not the plan so I thought it was a weird question to ask because she didn't mention about going to any other stores and we did not end up going to anywhere but the doctors office which I simply have to park and let her out and she walks no reason for me to wear a mask I'm in the car 100% of the time. She kept the mask on when we were traveling in the car  </p>
<p>The last time my uncle was over from the states and I live in Ontario Canada and we have draconian restrictions that city if you're quarantining someone no one else can even be in the house but nonetheless she let me in the house to go to the washroom and talk to her before we went however still had the mascot inside her house and in the car and she made my uncle stay downstairs and we had to talk on the phone for the favor he wanted me to do because he couldn't leave the house which I had no problem doing, She didn't say anything about the mask this time and I thought was over.  </p>
<p>This time my aunt was visiting she was also forced to go upstairs when I came in but she opened the front door and said hi to me from the driveway unfortunately there was a Bush obscuring her face I did not get to see it so I went in the house went to the washroom and on our way out on our way to the car she said from now on you wear your mask and again I was kind of taken aback and was reversing out of the driveway when I said well in what context I told you I have a mask if we go into a store.  </p>
<p>She never said it directly but she was basically hinting at me just wearing a mask whenever she was saying things like "if it makes people feel better" "I've been wearing a mask for a while now" so I basically told her if you're asking me to we met wear a mask in the house if that's what you're implying I'm not going to do that I said Janice as all the way upstairs I'm not even able to see her and you guys are social distancing as well so I really don't see the point.  </p>
<p>And this sets off kind of a long argument but she keeps on bringing up stuff like all well if it makes people feel better and I say I will merit wear a mask everywhere that I mandated by the bylaw and she says where do you think you are supposed to wear it and I said inside businesses and government buildings and enclosed space which is verbatim from my Township bylaw and I'm sure the Township we were in which is closer to the city is extremely similar if not the same you're not forced to wear masks outside in your car or in your own home.  </p>
<p>After I mentioned that I'm only gonna wear the mask where I mandated by the bylaw she said wow you sound like a Trumper and I said how your labeling me so you know I don't get into partisan issues and really don't support any political candidates here or in the US I also mentioned and leaned over and said it's okay grandma you know I love you no matter what gave her a big hug she and I thought it was over..  </p>
<p>A couple of minutes later she kinda brought it up again and made a more direct question said so you're not in the wear a mask in the house [ <em>and I said no I'm not, she said some other stuff and eventually I said what if you want me to drive you to these things like I'm not can have a wear a mask when I'm not mandated you can get the cabs again if you'd like and she chirped up and said don't you threaten me and tried to look intimidating at me but I can only tell there was anger in her eyes because she was wearing a mask in the car.</em>  </p>
<p><em>After that argument, devotion to her saying while I firmly believe people should wear masks and I said well are you afraid that your get a sneeze or cough on "aunt's name" and she said no and I said well asymptomatic cases are extremely rare however if you are afraid of getting infected that way you should know that the particles that in fact you are smaller the smoke particles and smoke particles come through your mask, therefore, they do not stop them. She said oh I don't believe that so I guess she actually believes that masks stop the virus not a n95 disposable blue masks.</em>  </p>
<p><em>Finally ended when she said well I believe people should wear masks again and I said that I believe people should have free choice and she put her arms up and shrugged and said okay.</em>  </p>
<p><em>I know my grandma for a long time I love her a lot is extremely out of character for her I've only had her get mad at me once before and that's when I was a kid and it was raining out and she wanted to get home and my cousin and I were taking a long time with scooters you know being kids so not a big the point is this is extremely out of character for her to say these things as well the first two times that I did these appointments she was not wearing a mask in her house on the car she just had it on her chin and put it on when she exited the car to go to the doctors.</em>  </p>
<p><em>She watches a lot of news and I always knew she had views that agreed with the mainstream narrative but I didn't know it was like this I didn't know when push came to shove she would actually prevent her family members from seeing each other in her house at least my aunt told me when I laughed when I said goodbye to her when I was hollering from the main floor upstairs she said I will see you next summer Ellie she's optimistic that.</em>  </p>

        <p>Dude it’s sad that you have this good relationship with your grandma and this mask bullshit gets in the way of you two. I would try to save the argument as she seems pretty hardwired and not open minded to opposition.</p>
<p>My grandma is the opposite she complained to me the other day how she went to her favorite restaurant and they were telling her to wear a mask. She said to them “No thank you, I don’t want to.” And they pulled the “Its not for us, it’s for you to protect you because your old.” And she said she got super pissed saying: “I don’t even know you, you don’t care about me and I’m healthy so why should I wear one and we are at a restaurant, I will walk ten feet over there and take off my mask.” She said they looked confused (I told her “probably because you’re a grandma and it’s not the narrative they were told) but they didn’t bother her after and let her eat there without a mask lol.</p>
<p>But back to your grandma, I’m not sure man this Covid shit is dividing not only the country but people’s families. You’re not alone.</p>

        <p>Yet does suck that mass all things are getting in the way me and my grandmother she's in great to me for my whole life very nice woman</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>She sent me the date for her next appointment and my aunt is not even to be in the house she's gone back to the states so I don't even think it will matter will see if she wears the mask in the car and her house again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think she won't judge me about your right with the fact that she is hardwired she watches the news alot since my grandpa passed but as a person she is pretty open-minded for instance my grandfather was a different religion and had different political views than her yet that didn't stop them from being married that may be common now but at the time it was not.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So at the end of that I think were good thanks for reading my post it was a bit longer anti-but just can't fucking believe this is all over a mask a mask that does nothing....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not only does that mass do nothing it was you logical pointless even to wear it in the instance that I was asked to but you can't stay mad at people you love have a nice day</p>
