    <strong>Flying during this holiday week</strong>
    <p><p>Just wanted to report that I flew yesterday and people are definitely not staying home. The plane was actually bigger than recent times I’ve taken this route and it was 100% full. The airport was also noticeably more crowded. </p>
<p>I did notice some doomers still decked out in those full body suits, but also a large amount of people pulling the mask down. Atmosphere was significantly more relaxed than even a few months ago. </p>
<p>Based on the crowds and packed flights I’d say it’s safe to say some people might be lying about not seeing family this week. </p>
<p>Anyone else flying this week? What’s been your experience?</p></p>

        <p>Crap.  I'm flying to Savannah on Tuesday and was hoping for deserted airports and empty planes.  Thought maybe I'd get something worthwhile out of this mess!</p>

        <p>Awww man should have flown back in May. It was like a private airport and never sat in a full row. Also upgrades were easier. But it was also all closed the atmosphere was weird. Now it’s basically the plane is as full but the airport is maybe 50-60% of normal people inside.</p>
