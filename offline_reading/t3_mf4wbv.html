    <strong>I am done.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm done having compassion for people because "they're brainwashed." I'm done giving people the benefit of the doubt when I see them wearing a mask. I don't give a flying fuck whether or not you disagree with all this but are "just doing what you need to to get by for now." You ARE the problem if that is where you're at at this point, and that makes you my enemy. Period.</p>
<p>This society has been shaped over the last year by USEFUL IDIOTS who do whatever the fuck kind of ideological diarrhea daddy fauci spews through his face daiper on any given day. It has royally fucked my life over. I lost my livelihood, all of my "friends" and most of my "family." I'm getting to the point as I've said in a couple comments here recently where I'm realizing I have little if anything to lose, socially speaking. </p>
<p>When do all these fucking trashheap excuses of people get to have their year of poverty and being mocked? When do we get to gaslight them for an entire fucking year, insisting that the opposite of obvious reality is actually true? I want to see these people suffer. I want them to be hungry, and not know when they will have any sort of respite from the emotional torture they're going through, same as I have.</p>
<p>I am about to the point where the next time someone taps me on the shoulder or touches me in any way in the context of a fucking mask conversation, they'll be getting an elbow to the face, maybe a knee to the balls (if applicable) and maybe, after I've taken them to the ground, a few broken ribs and a kicked in nose. </p>
<p>Oh, is that broken nose making it hard for you to breathe? <strong>I DON'T FUCKING CARE</strong>. You're delusional. You can breathe just fine. Fuck off with your anti science rhetoric. Everyone else has found a way to breathe just fine, why can't you? Stop being such a snowflake.</p>
<p>I hope everyone who gets this fucking "vaccine" (since that's what they're hell bent on calling it even though they've said it doesn't stop you from catching or spreading the virus) has serious health consequences 5 years or so from now. Neurological issues. Autoimmune disorders. Blood clots. The whole nine yards. Then, as they sit there suffering, I'm going to laugh in their fucking faces and tell them they should've listened to the science when they had the chance.</p>
<p>Honestly, I almost wish they'd just get on with the fucking concentration camps already. Bring it all out in the open. I'm tired of hearing it all blatantly threatened for a year now, and just waiting for it to happen "trying to enjoy my last days not in a camp in whatever way I can." No part of this fucking hellish life is enjoyable anymore. "We're gonna do this to you... and you're going to be happy about it! We're almost ready... the great reset is coming... vaccine passports are coming..." </p>
<p>Hey, Bill Gates: why don't you just fucking carpet bomb us all since you clearly would rather have so many fewer of us around? Just GET THE FUCK ON WITH IT. At least the war will be totally out in the open at that point, and many of us "dissenters" would get a quicker cleaner death than the fucking starvation-while-under-house-arrest death you're sentencing us to currently.</p></p>

        <p>I will do nothing horrible. Again, if they touch ME, I retain my right to physically defend myself to the fullest extent. I'm waiting for it to happen, because these NPC's are fucking crazy, too.</p>
<p>Guess what? I could give a flying fuck if this is "what they want." What, some guy throwing a fit ranting on the internet poses such a great danger to society that they need to take away everyone's rights and freedoms because of it? If that's the case... once again, bring it the fuck on, right out into the open. I personally don't think that someone ranting about having lost pretty much everything, and being surrounded on all sides in their community by hatred, justifies taking away everyone's liberty. In fact, the right to free speech kind of guarantees us the right to do just that: rant.</p>
<p>Again, I like I said in another comment: I'm not going to "do anything about it" because there's nothing I COULD do about it anyway. I don't even own a weapon. There's certainly no way I could cause vaccinated people to suffer neurological damage or anything like that. I just really wish I could see these people suffer in exactly the same ways I have, for as long as I have, and anyone who doesn't have enough empathy to understand why someone might be in that place emotionally can fuck right off as far as I'm concerned.</p>

        <p>I won’t pander to doomers anymore either. If you want to stay ignorant of truth that’s up to you.
That said I won’t be attacking people verbally or supporting any kind of violence towards people who choose masks and vaccine. 
That just plays into the hands of the establishment who thrive off division. 
I’m just not going to hold back in speaking my truth to anyone who tries to tell me what to put on my body or otherwise.</p>

        <p>I understand where you’re coming from I really do. But just think that eye for an eye mentality isn’t the way to go generally. 
Not saying things won’t get heated but surely our hatful energies should be towards the perpetrators of these crimes not the wobbly headed victims. 
I did call a security guard a jobsworth nazi cunt recently tho, so I’m prob being a bit hypocritical.</p>

        <p>No. That IS the point. At a certain level, "niceties" are not a luxury we can afford. Would you go back to Germany in the early 40's and tell people to be "kind" to the nazi soldiers or the people turning their neighbors in?</p>

        <p>I'm done trying to win hearts or minds on this topic. It is obvious enough for anyone with 2 braincells and one eye to see.</p>
<p>Also, I don't even know if "hate" is the word I would use. I am recognizing that they are my enemy. Their actions have directly, royally fucked my life over. I want justice, and if that's not going to happen through any kind of "justice system," I'm just kind of waiting/hoping for the "karma" style hurt to come down upon them all. </p>
<p>Nothing I could personally do to any of these people would be big enough anyway. I don't have the power to take their jobs away. I don't have the power to make everyone ELSE around them also treat them/look at them like they are dog shit for an entire year. I merely fantasize/wish for those things to happen.</p>

        <p>I've been waiting for the majority to feel and think like this since last year. I am so glad you shared your thoughts. You're not alone. Actualizing what you want and standing up for what you know is right will inspire others to do the same or at least reconsider their stance if they are living in fear. </p>
<p>At the same time, understand that fear makes people make decisions they cannot trust. Fear is a strong psychological weapon and that is why the powers that be work so hard to release propaganda that is fear based. We have to work on getting people out of this place of fear if they're going to engage the parts of their brain responsible for thoughtful decision making. </p>
<p>Take heart. Have courage and be kind to those who are not yet able to see as you are. Always be kind.</p>

        <p>I do my best. It is so hard to be kind to people who have been hurting me personally for a year now though. I know it's not right, but fucking hell who has patience for longer than a year of kindness when literally EVERYONE you come across in real life treats you with contempt/disgust/hatred? Not saying I'm in this state-of-mind being portrayed in this rant all the time (I've had this bottled up for quite some time now and have STILL been level headed and kind 100% of the time in real life), I'm just saying I am having a harder and harder time "being nice." Nobody's nice anymore unless you're following the "rules" anyway. Again <strong>I know it is not right to stoop to their level</strong>, but knowing what's right and having the physical or mental strength to do it are two different things a lot of the time (as noted all the time on this sub when people say "I hate the masks and don't think the mandates are right but I just do it anyway because I can't stand confrontation or whatever"). </p>
<p>I just have less and less patience for stupidity each day.</p>

        <p>The problem being that they will all get sick and be in wheelchairs but we live in a "democracy" so there will be a huge "wheelchair" voting block which will require that we pay for all of their medical bills and ensure that they have equity which means either they will need robot bodies to be like the rest of us (which we all pay for) or we all have to be confined to wheelchairs so we're all equal. If history says anything, it will be the latter.</p>

<p>Can't really be mad at a sheep following the herd, but i also do not have to feel compassion or try to defend them or care about them in any way at all. They are responsible for their own actions. If they just followed what somebody else told them, they are still themselves responsible.</p>
<p>We should not care about the sheeple. We should not try to appeal to sheeple. Because it is pointless. If you are in charge, they will follow you anyway. If you are not in charge, then it doesn't matter what you do, they will never follow you.</p>

        <p>Still, there's a limit imo. I tried to show my father in law some statistics of covid deaths, sorted by age. He literally looked away, turned his head to face the wall until I put my phone away.</p>
<p>I told a friend (know her for 12 years now) that I don't think it's proportional to have cancer screening and treatments postphoned for the 1% chance of catching covid in the hospital. I haven't heard from her for months now. I also sent her a video of doctors speaking out against the lockdowns in june. First she couldn't watch it because her internet didn't work (for a month), then she didn't have time (despite being unemployed at the time), then it was 'tiring to look at all these conflicting views'. </p>
<p>Fuck these people. I can't trust them anymore. These are the type of people that refused to get on a lifeboat when the Titanic was sinking.</p>

        <p>It's frustrating for sure. My friends don't know they're making fun of me when they say " the crazy people who think this is fake". People will don't want to let go of their world. It is traumatizing to think something you know is true and believe so deeply, is wrong. You will literally turn away from the physical discomfort and do anything to push it out.</p>

        <p>idk bro,
i was reading countless death threats against specific personalities on twitter and reddit just a few weeks ago because they stated that they aren't sexually attracted to transgender people.
So maybe i am just to numb for those now.
Threatening that you would defend yourself in an extrme way if someone harasses you is pretty harmless compared to those open personal death threats after all.</p>

        <p>Well that's your perception and i can't change that. All i know is that we see people in such state and worst and dead by suicide because they lost everything,have no help and are isolated since a whole year.</p>
<p>Restrictions aren't the same everywhere,some are extremely stricts and many lockdowns made businesses go bankrup,people lost their jobs and education,became depressed,started to argue or even fight with their partners,divorces,suicides and unfortunately it is higher than ever and younger than ever,people don't know what is waiting for them in the future,it is a stressful time for everybody no matter our views about the whole picture. There's so so much suffering going on people wouldn't believe it...</p>
<p>Lockdowns have such sinister side effects and much more than covid. But people don't speak about it enough. These people need urgent help and OP said he won't do anything stupid meaning he knows the difference between right and wrong,he's not insane,he's had enough,he's exhausted.</p>

        <p>After dealing with a failed suicide attempt in the family a little over a decade ago, and the fallout/aftermath of that, I made a vow to myself that no matter WHAT, I would never do that, with the one exception of everyone else I knew having already died so they would not have to go through all that. </p>
<p>I personally believe that each man or woman should have the right to their life or death. It is their body after all, and hanging yourself or something puts no one else in immediate physical danger. All that said, I also personally believe it's one of the most selfish acts one can commit in over 99% of cases, hypotheticals notwithstanding.</p>
<p>As far as hurting anyone else, that's a no brainer for anyone who's even slightly interested in true freedom and rights. The basic laws are: you don't fuck with someone or their shit. If someone comes up and fucks with YOU, then they have started a physical altercation and IMO it would be ignorant to not defend yourself.</p>
