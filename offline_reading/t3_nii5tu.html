    <strong>How many of us believe the virus is real?</strong>
    <p><p>I had forgotten the fact that the flu was almost gone in terms of cases/deaths last year, which is making me reconsider if covid19 is even its own, real virus-caused malady. It's easy to believe it really does exist, and that <em>some</em> people have died from it. But after rerealizing that all the hand washing and distancing and mask wearing basically rid us of the flu, well, I sort of go ohhhh. Covid is the flu. </p>
<p>What do you think? Is covid a real, novel coronavirus or is it a steaming load of freshly steeped, unadulterated,  vegan-organic bullshit?</p></p>

        <p>I’m convinced that Covid is real. Everyone in my family  except for me got it. I’ll take them at their word for it.</p>
<p>However, it is my opinion that the response to the virus was blown greatly out of proportion</p>

        <p>But did you get Covid or did you get the flu and get told it was Covid? Also did you take different medications for it this time because it was the scary Covid, and could those have made things seem worse that the flu?</p>
<p>If you didn't take any different medications, what was the difference that made you think "this is definitely not the flu". Was it just the PCR test? I'll let the inventor of the test tell you what bullshit that is, how its not meant to diagnose a disease. </p>
<p>Or was a loss of smell / taste ... this is supposedly the only distinguishing factor between Covid and Flu, but honestly, how many of us even remember checking for this kind of stuff during the flu. I figure this is mostly psychological and recency bias ... like the last time had the flu which was years ago, I don't recall having a very good sense of taste or smell either.</p>

        <p>I got covid. I usually get a flu every year, but last year it felt quite different. Instead of having postnasal drip and a watery cough, I had a dry cough and clear sinuses. </p>
<p>The disease exists, it's just so similar to the flu that there's a lot of crossover.</p>

        <p>What are you saying tho? His family had the flu and were told it was covid. Or something along those lines? </p>
<p>I personally think it’s real because my whole family got unreasonably sick in December of 2019 after my dad came home from business in China. Couple months before it all officially started. We almost took my Dad to the hospital. He was real fucked up. We had a guy come to the house one day and give us all vitiman B12 shots and an IV rehydration we felt so bad. Keep in mind we had no idea what covid was. Also I’ve never got it.... I’ve had verifiable exposures. At work, the gym and my best friend got it. We hung out the day he got tested. Nobody in my family got it either. I can’t tell this story without being called crazy. But it’s my experience.</p>

        <p>I think covid is very real but overblown. I think it's basically like the flu, it's here but it's not destroying humanity. The death rate #s are absolutely manipulated, and masks and lockdowns were immoral even if the media reports were accurate!</p>

        <p>75 years of study proved that social distancing and masks doesn't stop the flu. Yet the flu is suddenly down a million cases while covid is up a 1.1 million cases. The covid test also pings a false positive if the tested has influenza or rhinovirus in their system</p>

        <p>No. I don't want to catch it. I also don't want an experimental vaccine until it has had the longterm studies finished and legal liabilities are in place - like for all the other vaccines I have taken.</p>
<p>Also these vaccines don't stop you catching it, it just means you have ONE very specific antibody that gets rid of the virus quicker.</p>
<p>The issue with 80% of a population having the identical antibody to a virus that mutates easily is you force quicker variants. Whereas when a virus is transferring from host to host of different immunities and antibodies, it still mutates but in many directions and thus averages out many evolutionary directions and yields less pathogenic abilities.</p>
<p>Having an homogenised population the virus has to evolve ONCE, against that antibody, and those vaccines are pointless.</p>
<p>This isn't conspiracy - this is well known science that even mainstream admit, hence them always blabbering on about variants.</p>
<p>The easiest way around this is just to use the old fashioned attenuated virus model of vaccine, which so far no company wants to do, despite it being a tried and tested form of vaccine for 1.5 centuries.</p>

        <p>Covid is real and it's an especially contagious strain of the flu. It's also incredibly survivable for anyone under 70. My whole family got it. We're all still here. The primary reason we're refusing the vaccine is because we developed a natural immunity to it.</p>

        <p>It's basically the flu, except a slightly worse one than most years.</p>
<p>In 2020, if "covid 19" had been treated like a bad flu season, we wouldn't be talking about it right now. It would have run its course like every other flu.</p>
<p>So I think "the virus" is technically real, but virtually everything that government health officials (starting with the WHO) have told us about it is false or wildly exaggerated.</p>

        <p>Yeah, spot on, the flu is being recorded as covid cases. There is no covid, there's no isolation test, there's no proof of contagion, pfizers vaccine department stated that they didn't not get any sample of covid, just a computer generated genome report.

        <p>The coronavirus known as SARS-2, SARS-CoV-2, or CoVid-19 exists. That's not something we should be arguing. The virus is a coronavirus, like SARS, like rhinovirus and like many others. It is what it is. It's a thing that exists regardless of whether it's novel or antique, and whether it's from a lab leak or zoonotic transmission. Denying that reality is asinine.</p>
<p>Hell, I'm not even arguing about whether in some cases, face-coverings might have had some vanishing degree of positive impact anymore. People can wear what they want, businesses can set policies they want, and those in a public role should be serving in an advisory capacity to provide all possible support to the public. If that includes saying that they believe face-coverings might help, that's fine.</p>
<p>Where I draw the line is the moment the government starts making mandates.</p>

        <p>SARS COV 2 is a real virus but it is rare. They lumped pneumonia, influenza and covid together to make it seem more legit. Antibody tests  would pick up only live virus. Instead, they use PCR tests using too many cycles and get false positives on old, dead nucleotides. Flu kills 30/65k American annually. That went to nearly 0 in 2020.</p>

        <p>As somebody who lost their father from covid, I feel as though I am in a place to say that covid does exist, but massively blown out of proportion. Death rates are no higher in the world than they have been in previous years. Flu is non existent any more, being labelled as covid now. The symptoms they suggest just cover most illnesses, viruses and allergies etc. If my hayfever plays up, I get nasally, headaches and can't taste/smell. Don't need another swab up my nose, I'll juts take a benadryl thanks. I'll say that masks work to an extent but be fucked if I'm wearing one outside. I also had my first vaccine and I will not be getting my second one, I bought into the bullshit that Canada offered and there doesn't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel so fuck it. This rant is all over the place but felt this was as good of a place as any to get it out there.</p>

        <p>By the way, I should've offered my condolences earlier. I'm sorry you lost your father. That must be very difficult.</p>
<p>To be fair, a friend asked me, if someone is healthy and then they "test positive" and die, what else could it be? I get it. But the PCR tests were run at cycle thresholds way above accurate standards, so there's a high likelihood the test is a false positive, and that the person died from some other cause. Honestly, I don't have any stats on regular ol' people suddenly dying, but I know mortals die, so... I mean, the CDC did reveal that only 5% of people who died from covid didn't have any comorbidities. Maybe your dad fits into that 5%?</p>

        <p>Covid isn’t real, nothing you can touch or see.</p>
<p>Getting sick, or, the flu, is your body going through a cleanse cycle controlled by your hormones if your health deteriorates to an extent (variable reasons).</p>
<p>Our bodies communicate with eachother through hormones, precisely how you can just TELL someone is upset or sad or any strong emotions. If you’re healthy, the hormones that say clean up, don’t go through.</p>
<p>Take your vitamin c, lots of sun, and magnesium</p>
