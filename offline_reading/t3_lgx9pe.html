        <p>India rolling vaccine like a race between countries like going to win gold </p>
<p>India people literacy rate is very bad </p>
<p>Only resource they use is news or youtube or Google or fb or any apps which is basically video like snapchat , tiktok etc </p>
<p>So mass brainwash via bolywood , corrupt politician, news media etc runs the country divided by 28+ languages ( state basis top level )</p>

        <p>Belgium,</p>
<p>-We’re only allowed to have one close contact
(I know no one who follows this rule tho)</p>
<p>-curfews</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>during the holidays, you could only have one person over. Two when you live alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not official, but you can’t seem to have fun in public without cops whining. We were dancing in the park with a few friends once when it was summer, weren’t breaking any rules but we were told to stop because it’s COVID.</p>

        <p>America. Double masks. Lord Fauci says two mask are better than one so just like the obedient little sheep they are they put on that second mask without hesitation. Now when I go to the store or work around half of the people I see have two masks on.</p>

<p>Mass countrywide testing. Dont have a test? Welp too bad youre stuck at home...oh wait there are a 1000 exceptions to that? Oh no the whole test is useless...</p>
<p>Malls and shops have hours dedicated for the elderly  but they can shop at any time forcing me to either get up early or eat shit for 3 hours in the morning. </p>
<p>Also this a private bitch bullshit but I had to show a test to my dentist otherwise she would refuse the service...didnt have it so she refused service, but she still went to my mouth and did some shit to stop the pain.. dont see the logic in that, she still had to clean all her equipment and was in "threat" lmao</p>

        <p>Israel. OH MY GOD. America has it easy. Israel publicly passed a law saying they will trace phone calls of people who tested positive. Much stricter lockdowns in much smaller houses than America has. Israelis were not given 600$ a month plus unemployment checks or stimulus checks. Masks must be worn outside or you’ll get a ticket. Cops check daily at random hours the homes of people who tested positive. Over 60% of the country vaccinated and positives still going up somewhat unbelievable. Only like 6k deaths. That’s less than one in a million. My grandma had it 95 years old life long smoker until a few years back just had to skull surgeries at 93. She had barely even a cough. And just like how in America it was used very politically Israel’s prime minister is being very political about it.</p>
