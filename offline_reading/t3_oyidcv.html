        <p>I think this was hilarious, but on a serious note, I think we shouldn’t. My concern is it makes it look like the mandates and passports work. There are many businesses who may be holding out only because they are afraid of lost business. When another business mandates it they are watching closely to see if it thrives or fails. If that jackass is in the news next week talking about how their restaurant has never been busier (even though many were fakes), others will follow suit. We need to shun them like they are shunning us. Even in NYC where certain businesses “have no choice.” If they are losing customers, they will fight back. If they are doing well, they won’t bother. I know it’s hard but we have to think long term, not short term. It’s going to get harder and harder to forge so we need to focus on getting rid of the policies not getting around them.</p>
<p>Again, I realize this is a joke! I just feel passionately about this.</p>
