    <strong>The battle of our time: “Scientific research” vs basic common sense</strong>
    <p><p>How many times have you argued with someone on here and they just start linking a bunch of research papers? Happens to me all the time. I made the argument one time that making kids wear masks 24/7 was promoting fear and depriving them of social skills. And the dude comes back with the classic “Do you have any studies that prove that?”</p>
<p>Nope! I have something much better: <strong>Basic Common Sense</strong></p>
<p>It’s a scarce resource among our top experts, whose computer models and studies on hamsters didn’t allow them to see what all of us have known from the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>No amount of lockdowns and masking could ever eradicate Covid</li>
<li>Making people lock down and mask for years is inhumane, and no one with even an ounce of self respect would comply</li>
</ul>
<p>So next time someone asks what “study” or “research paper” you used to come to these conclusions, just respond with

        <p>I noticed this before covid even started on a mommy message board I use to read. You'd have a group of people trying to have a conversation on some mundane childcare thing and in would come the "peer reviewed study" crowd. With them you couldn't have an opinion without having a study to back it up. Never mind the fact you could find studies supporting various methods/ opinions on the subject at hand.</p>

        <p>That’s another problem with just using studies to back arguments. Since there’s so much info available, you can just come up with a conclusion <em>then</em> find a study that backs it. Which I imagine is what those people were doing. And the point isn’t even to convince people, it’s just to say “hey look I’m smart, I read things”</p>
