    <strong>Can Someone Please Explain the Logic?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep hearing in the course of the vaccine push that even though I have natural immunity from the OG covid, the scary delta strain is lurking in the shadows and that I need the vaccine because my soft, shitty body isn't powerful enough to fight delta on its own.</p>
<p>My question is this: What exactly is the mechanism of action that causes the vaccine (which was developed to fight regular ol' vanilla covid before delta was a sparkle in its host cell's endoplasmic reticulum) to fight a variant of a pathogen better than natural immunity?</p>
<p>I have yet to receive a straight answer on this from anyone. For that matter, from my understanding of the technology behind the vaccine really the only difference from a "classic" vaccine is that instead of injecting you with remnants of dead viral matter, they inject you with the "programming" to have your cells around the injection site manufacture the viral matter themselves. </p>
<p>Now I could be off or missing a big piece of the puzzle here. I just fail to logically see how it could be possible that Pfizer's spike proteins train your immune system better than Wuhan's spike proteins. </p>
<p>I also realize that there is a distinct possibility that there is absolutely no scientific basis for the claim that the vaccine fights delta better. I just wanna go back to 1997.</p></p>

        <p>If you’ve had COVID, not only do you have natural immunity, which could last years. It is actually dangerous for you to get the vaccine because it will cause ADE. You will end up with system wide inflammation and possibly die from it. That’s the real science.</p>

        <p>So my personal decision is I won't be getting jabbed - but I'm going to make an attempt to answer your question!</p>
<p>Dosage.</p>
<p>When you get infected you don't really have any control over the quantity you are exposed to. </p>
<p>Is it possible you only get exposed to a very low dose?
Does this low dose make stronger immunity? / weaker immunity? A different type of immunity? What uf your innate immune system destroys the virus before the adaptive immune system kicks in to generate antibodies? Does the route of infection (mucosal membranes of your respiratory system) have anything to do with the immune response illicited?</p>
<p>On the other hand - when you get the jab - you're getting a known quantity of material. That someone has calculated to be "a good quantity"</p>
<p>Now everybody's body will be a little different, you might produce a little more spike protein than the next person, a little less, the mRNA might be cleared from your system a little faster, a little slower - but on average - you get "a dose"</p>
<p>(as an aside - notice vaccines are interesting in that they are the only drug where everybody gets the same. Typical drugs - if you're a big guy, with a larger bodymass, a doctor might prescribe you a higher dose of a drug than he would a little old lady. The same way some people can drink beer after beer while another would be under the table - so I'm thinking as I'm writing perhaps I've just invalidated my own attempt at answering your question)</p>
<p>But from everything I've read - I'm convinced natural immunity has <strong>the potential</strong> to be superior to jab-induced immunity.</p>

        <p>Well, first off, this idea that we're independently tracking and investigating each case of CoV-2 and determining it's specific variant is a fares. I have multiple MDs and Nurses in my family whom have been dealing with this daily and NONE of them have had the ability to identify a specific variant at the clinic or hospital, all they have is the faulty EUA PCR and rapid test which provides a binary positive or negative.</p>
<p>To identify the variant, a sample has to be sent to a Lab for analysis and DNA sequencing which is both timely and expensive. It's not happening at any scale, whatsoever. This variant idea is simply a way to sustain a drumbeat of panic and fearmongering... The virus is trying to find a way to survive and is seeking normality/equilibrium in its environment to insure it's survival which means it'll continue being contagious but will become less and less "dangerous" to the host. It can't survive if we all die.</p>
