        <p>Didnt Fauci himself co-author a paper in 2009 that determined that most of the Spanish Flu deaths were from bacterial pneumonia caused by the masks mandates?</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2599911/">It doesn‚Äôt mention masks specifically.</a> But I think it‚Äôs a reasonable assertion that a contaminated piece of saliva/sneeze soaked filth that you just pulled from your pocket/purse isn‚Äôt doing you any favors in terms of preventing bacterial pneumonia. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs the things Fauci‚Äôs papers DON‚ÄôT EVER say about masks that surprises me. Not once that I have found yet has Fauci ever mentioned wearing a mask in day to day life as a virus prevention method. Not until this year. A guy who has spent 50 years studying viruses just now realized this year that a ripped up t-shirt is really all we ever needed for a respiratory virus? Not once in any of the conclusions regarding future preventative methods is a mask even speculated about. </p>
<p>He knows they‚Äôre bullshit. He‚Äôs going along with this narrative to keep people calm (ish) until whatever the fuck endgame anyone thinks is coming down the pipes.</p>
<p>Edit: I‚Äôm not siding with Fauci here guys, dude is a fool who makes contradictory statements left and right and talks from his ass because he never wants to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù</p>

<p>Masks were really unpopular with anti mask league headed by a woman.</p>
<p>What gets me about the parallels between 1918 and now is that WW1 was essentially a squabble between sword fighting aristocrats and they slaughtered millions to get more power for themselves. Seeing the MSM ignore the deaths of despair of young people while inaccurately insinuating they died of coronavirus has got me wondering who is advocating for humanity?</p>
