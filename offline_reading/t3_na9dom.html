    <strong>Does the vaccine actually EXIST? A discussion with evidence...</strong>
    <p><p>Does the vaccine actually exist? Or is it just salt water?</p>
<p>EVIDENCE:</p>
<p>1 - Saline Shots Mistakenly Delivered</p>

<p>2 - People Catching Covid who have been Vaxxed</p>
<p>Most Vaccinated Country has Outbreak</p>

<p>Thousands of Fully Vaccinated People Catch Covid Anyways</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>3 - No Access to vax IP, blank instructions, no third-party vax studies</p>
<p>Obviously don't need to link this here. But the point is, they say it is "mRNA" technology and so on, making it sound fancy and complicated, but we don't have the recipe on how they actually manufacture, just some gobble-de-gook. Pharmacists finding blank instructions also makes sense if there was no vax.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>4 - Everyone you know personally is fine after taking the vax</p>
<p>You just hear about bad stuff on fringe sites, random screenshots of social media posts, and blurry videos. All easily faked.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>5 - Diminishing Requirements</p>
<p>At first these vaccines were so delicate they required extreme cold storage. Now they don't care and are stored at room temperature (saline). At first the vaccines were such advanced technology they needed exactly 28 days apart between doses. Now it's 4 months or whenever.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>MOTIVE:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>- Profit-motive for big pharma - what could be better than selling saline at an insane markup?</p>
<p>- Uptake of willing participants - if friends+family were dropping dead, they'd be quick to abandon their co-operation. More people will get on board for long-term forced-injections this way.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other possibilities:</p>
<p>- Actual deaths and side effects including fainting could be statistically explained by dirt, contamination, infection, and improper procedure (air in tube), which would be likely to occur over millions+billions of doses. Perhaps even a saline shot could upset a person with a weak disposition. Also it's not hard to fake act a side effect.</p>
<p>- Reuse existing flu vax stockpile to produce immune reactions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Am I arguing you should get the vax if it's only saline? <strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But I am saying maybe there is a psyop on both sides going on: "everyone must get the vax it's safe" and "the vax is dangerous". The 'dangerous' camp looks like alarmist fools to the people who get vaxxed because nothing bad happened to them.</p>
<p>The agenda is to get everyone to accept government injections as a precursor to freedom (vax passport = social credit score). As you all know is a 10 year plan and they wouldn't throw all their cards on the table in year 1 or 2.</p>
<p>I admit this is a wild conspiracy theory, with only circumstantial evidence to back it up, but... if you think about it... it's actually less far-fetched than a mass-produced DNA-modifying injection. It's also easily proven/disproven by getting access to random vials of the shot.</p></p>

        <p>But would this cause heart problems? I've had multiple family members on one side in the hospital after the vaccine for mostly heart irregularities and one case of breathing problem. The time was between a week and 6 weeks after vaccination but there are five cases of this in my aunts and uncle's, otherwise I'd probably be more likely to question whether it's real or even actually harmful.</p>

        <p>If you're going to run clinical trials, and NEED everyone to participate, maybe we aren't the control group like we're assuming. </p>
<p>Perhaps it's targeted by zip code or area code.</p>
<p>Also, someone needs to be checking for Thallium poisoning. The fact people are sticking magnets to their arms is a sign of heavy metal poisoning. Most of these side effects are in lock step with Thallium.</p>

        <p>&rt;Perhaps it's targeted by zip code or area code.</p>
<p>This is definitely more of a possibility. I think the long-term goal is to be able to target people individually and administer injections based on their digital data: race, religion, etc. Then they can perfectly control and cull people any way they wish.</p>
<p>But in the short-term they could have delivered different batches regionally. Perhaps the regions they wanted more control over were given high-quality saline and the regions they didn't care about or wanted to harm were delivered something dangerous.</p>
<p>&rt;The fact people are sticking magnets to their arms</p>
<p>Remember to view everything with skepticism. We know the parasites-that-be are master liars and that could include pumping out fake alarmism like this. Unless you see this personally or it is reported from someone you know and trust, it's not high-quality evidence.</p>

        <p>Do the vaccines exist, yes they do. Drug companies are making millions if not billions off of it, and to many people are having side effects shortly after getting the shot. Is the saline story true? Possibly.</p>
<p>Here is the main problem. There is not one source of media that anyone can really trust on either side. Maybe its a prank post, maybe it is a psyops, maybe it is actually real, maybe its a bot, maybe its a plane out lie. There has been so much disinformation that it is hard to tell what is true and what is false. </p>
<p>I don‘t know a single person that got seriously sick from COVID, nor died. I do know people who got bad side effects from the vaccine. I do know many people have turned into little tyrants about mask wearing from experience. </p>
<p>The divisions in this country already existed. COVID is just making them come out in full view.</p>

        <p>After I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/z7ibaXq3iUA"><strong>this video about how Koch’s postulates were not adhered to</strong></a>, I realized that the PCR test is junk (too many false positives), as well as the virus itself has never ever been isolated (let alone seen through an electron microscope 🔬, this caused me to doubt everything. There were videos that have been delisted where you had CGI artists were hired by certain consulting firms to help add color to certain microscopic images where you possibly had our own exosomes surrounding bacteria or gathered at an area that was inflamed by some accident, but they coloured it in such a way to make these exosomes look like covid-19. So many things have been taken down that I regret not downloading the videos to my hard drive. Exosomes look very similar or identical to what we’ve been shown as SARS-CoV-2, but there’s a high probability that it was just our own exosomes or perhaps one of several strains of the coronavirus family members (aka the common cold). The PCR test may in fact be producing many false positives from influenza, common cold, or (and this is the big one) or the fact that if SARS-CoV-2 were real and found in a person (who had or never had symptoms attributed to it) that the PCR test itself cannot tell the difference if the genetic material captured in the sample is from live or dead virus material. If you have a chance try to find as many Dolores Cahill videos as possible. She’s an expert in this field but YouTube and Facebook continually tries to take down videos of her, or of Dr Andrew Kaufman, and several other respectable professionals who I follow.</p>

<p>The CDC admits they threw out loud postulate when they couldn’t reproduce the same symptoms in another human with whatever they had isolated. Anyway, there is no novel virus. Everything after that is a fraud.. insane stuff. They simply count on people not reading it and digesting it...</p>

        <p>I actually had a similar theory... this theory requires that you actually believe Trump cares for America and his grandchildren ( I believe he does and don't think he is one of "them")</p>
<p>I think his "operation warp speed" may have been warp speed defensive strategy in anticipation for the deadly vaccination campaigns to usher in depopulation agenda. I don't think it is all salt water... but I think the military (again as per operation warp speed the military were the ones to deliver the vaccines around the country) I think they may have sabotaged a certain number, perhaps a large portion of them, or replaced batches with saline or regular flu shots etc. I think some of them are real in order to get some of the severe reactions so that the globalists who want to kill people actually think their plan is moving along swimmingly. I think the really bad reactions won't happen until the winter time when the seasonal virus returns and those who had the real shots will experience cytokine storms and likely perish. But again, I think the number will be much lower than what could have occurred without the military intervention. I do not fully endorse this theory but it has floated around my head because people often say why does Trump tout the vaccine.... It actually is funny, literally every treatment Trump suggested the media blasted and fake science derided and said was dangerous like hydroxyclorochine and invermectin... but the one they do not question is the vaccine which, again, he is responsible for helping get made. And he also touted it. That is what makes me think the vaccine could be really sinister, or was supposed to be, because if the media and the paid-off scientists treated the vaccine like everything else Trump recommended they would have said they are unsafe! Rushed! Unproven effectiveness! Don't get it! Orange man Bad! </p>
<p>TLDR: Operation Warp Speed was a defensive military campaign designed to save lives by sabotaging or replacing large amounts of supposed vaccine vials.</p>

        <p>Problem with this theory, now that he's out of power, the globalists would just start replacing the fake ones with dangerous ones, making him culpable for continuing to promote it.</p>
<p>The Trump is a "secret good guy" theory is bunk.</p>
<p>If he was a legit good guy he would have used his many opportunities to go live with the truth.</p>

        <p>Wild thought also but what if the whole "the storm" thing were to relate to cytokine storm, whether Trump is good or bad it would still fit. It's not hard for me to believe that psychopaths run the world, I mean they're everywhere in daily life people just don't see it because they hide it well</p>

        <p>There are too many reports of vaccine adverse reactions for them all to be dismissed. I wonder if saline injections were done by conscientious doctors refusing to poison their populace with experimental medical devices.</p>

        <p>Yes, we are quickly learning vaccines work.  <a href="https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2021/05/11/cleveland-clinic-study-employees-covid-19-vaccine-protected-unvaccinated-infections-get-the-sh/5025596001/">https://www.beaconjournal.com/story/news/2021/05/11/cleveland-clinic-study-employees-covid-19-vaccine-protected-unvaccinated-infections-get-the-sh/5025596001/</a></p>

<p>Only 0.3% of the infections occurred among those who were fully vaccinated (two weeks after the second dose)."</p>
