    <strong>Project Fear Agitprop: Why Is All COVID-19 News Bad News? (Peer-Reviewed Study)</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; "The most striking fact is that 87 percent of the U.S. stories are classified as negative, whereas 51 percent of the non-USÂ stories are classified as negative."  </p>
<p>Link to peer-reviewed article:  <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.dartmouth.edu/dist/4/2318/files/2021/03/Why-Is-All-Covid-News-Bad-News-3_22_21.pdf">Why-Is-All-Covid-News-Bad-News</a></p>
<p>ABSTRACT:</p>
<p>&rt; We analyze the tone of COVID-19 related English-language news articles written since January  1, 2020. Eighty seven percent of stories by U.S. major media outlets are negative in tone versus  fifty percent for non-U.S. major sources and sixty four percent for scientific journals. The  negativity of the U.S. major media is notable even in areas with positive developments including  school re-openings and vaccine trials. Media negativity is unresponsive to changing trends in new  COVID-19 cases or the political leanings of the audience. As evidenced by most viewed and most  shared major media readers in the U.S. and U.K. strongly prefer negative stories about COVID19, and negative stories in general. But the U.S. major media is more willing to satisfy this demand for negativity in both COVID and pre-COVID years. We suggest that this American  exceptionalism stems from the lack of fair and balanced media laws and a lack of a large public  option in the U.S. media. The causal impacts of this negative COVID coverage are less obvious;  counties in the U.S. that rely more heavily on the major media are as likely to re-open schools as other similar counties.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. Just had an argument with an "engineer where math is his trade" and he couldn't figure out the simple math that covid has been less than 1% of total deaths despite me literally showing him line by line. And I don't even have a degree. Apparently he "knows people who have died from it" and seems to think that proves anything.</p>
<p>Apparently, despite covid being such a "big deal" the death rate is still hovering between 8 and 9 per 1000, as it has been for the last 41 years. Crazy right? Even if it went up to 10, there are more heart disease deaths this year to account for that as well. There are more stress related deaths this year I can guarantee it. It's weird how shutting down an entire economy for almost a year would do something like that.</p>

        <p>It's literally insane. I can almost guarantee he is better than me at math, I have no issue admitting that if he truly is an engineer, but the article he linked me did some bogus math and apparently he didn't even check it or he actually believes it, which would make me question the degree. Here is the article he linked me:</p>
<p>https://usafacts.org/articles/preliminary-us-death-statistics-more-deaths-in-2020-than-2019-coronavirus-age-flu/</p>
<p>It says that it's an increase of 12% which is an outright lie. 12% is under the circumstance of the deaths being 9.7 per 100, not 9.7 per 1000 as it's supposedly calculated. But I'm sure they know this.</p>
<p>The actual number is 0.1044% because if you go from 8.7 to 9.7 you have to divide them by 1000 and multiply by 100 to get the percentage (or just divide by 10 in this case) of deaths per 1000 people. So it went from .87% to .97%. Now I'm not a math genius but that looks like .1% more to me, not 12% more as stated in that article.</p>
<p>I could be wrong though and if my math is wrong I'll admit it but I trade stocks and base everything around percentages and I punched in 8.7 + 12% in my calculator which popped out 9.7 but that is on a 1/100 basis not a 1/1000 basis. From what I'm gathing though, it's .1044% of an increase, a much lower number than 12% lol</p>

        <p>When people graduate from institutional learning facilities, they have been taught to celebrate by wearing a square hat. Sign that their minds have been form-fit to the system. Very few maintain much independent thought after that, in my experience, especially as more degrees pile up. So while I do respect the effort and cost of graduate school, it doesn't automatically mean the graduate is smart.</p>
