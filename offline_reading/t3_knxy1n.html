        <p>Like Lake Wobegone, where all of the children are above average. </p>
<p>If the majority are “high risk” how do we assess a medium-level risk?</p>

        <p>I honestly don't understand how they came to the conclusion there are that many people at high risk. If they were that high risk, don't you think over the last year that this has been around (especially the beginning with no measures in place) they would have already caught it?</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to me. For them to claim this now, contradicts how "contagious and deadly" this all is.</p>
<p>Edit: sorry for the redundancy, words are hard</p>

        <p>My parents who are dead from CoVid-19 would care to disagree with you.</p>
<p>Mom was not even 'high risk' in the real world. Yeah, she was 69 but she was a damned healthy 69 year old woman who had laughed at numerous colds and flus in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Dad had a known overactive immune system that when he got his transplant they were concerned that they would not be able to control his immune system with the usual tacrolimus they use so you don't reject organs.</p>
<p>If this thing can take out my parents, it can take out basically anyone coming to the 70 year mark. That is what we have to be concerned about because 70 is not the median age of death except when you include pack-a-day smokers and heavy heavy H E A V Y drinkers in the equation. When you don't? The median age of death is 86 years old.</p>

        <p>While you have my most sincere condolences, that's exactly the group that's at "high risk". Over 60. I too caught C19. After I had two major surgeries in January and my body was still recovering. I only wish your parents had acquired ivermectin to mitigate the effects they endured. </p>
<p>I won't argue with you though, you've lost parents. I will take what you said and keep it close. Best wishes to you.</p>

        <p>My mom died of the flu at 64 in Feb 2018. It was an especially nasty flu season. Yes, she had some underlying conditions. But no one shut down the world or made mandates over it. And she wouldn’t have wanted that either.</p>
