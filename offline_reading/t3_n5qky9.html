    <strong>My Prediction: Mandated vaccinations for schools K-12 won't happen. If so, there would be huge outcry.</strong>
    <p><p>Think about how controversial it was when the discussion of mandated COVID-19 passports was for many people. There were people on both sides didn't agree with it. I mean, many of the conservative community didn't agree with it when it was suggested by the Biden administration. A mandated COVID vaccine as a trade to get your freedom or else? I feel like that would be just outcry waiting to happen.</p>
<p>They can't force kids in public schools to get it or else. Not with how hot everything is at the moment. America is meant to be free and we won't let the ones who infect her destroy the idea of that.</p></p>

<p>DC actually voted in a law that allows Doctors, nurses and school officials to vaccinate children without getting parental permission or even telling the parents. </p>
<p>You Americans better wake up or you will end up like Canada.</p>

        <p>I hope you are right but I fear many Americans are being complacent and too trusting. Your Deep State has been actively disobeying Elected Officials and working against the interests of half of the USA. </p>
<p>They don’t believe the same as you and they believe you will sit at home until its too late. Canada, UK, Australia and many other allies have been completely taken over by Marxist Technocrats.</p>
<p>Texas will be going blue in the next 10 years because of the influx of Californians and balance of Power in the USA will flip. </p>
<p>Americans don’t really know how bad it is in other countries. The Left is educating your children and have been teaching them to despise everything that once made the USA great. </p>
<p>The Left won’t take your guns, they will program your children to give them up with their rights. It has only taken 20 years to destroy the Freedoms in Canada. And they are taking over the USA one child at a time. </p>
<p>Good luck, I mean it.</p>

        <p>I hear yoy and understand your concerns. We already know that they're doing all of that. The left runs deep but they're the machine now and people are bound to rebel. Many of the American Conservative base is against the idea of vaccinating children through mandatory means and I'm sure we will fight it. </p>
<p>There's also a big amount of Americans who are simply skeptical of it. They wouldn't be desperate for people to get it if people weren't. It's why many vaccine clinic's seem to be closing or dropping appointments and many are just dismissing appointments in general in favor of just letting people in when they walk in. </p>
<p>America was founded on the ideas of rebellion and I think that's surely why this is a hard nut to crack for the deep state. </p>
<p>Patriots though won't let her fall to these morons.</p>
