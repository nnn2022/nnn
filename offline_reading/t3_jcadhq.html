<p>Other subs I've been recently banned from:  /r/Food, /r/Art, /r/news </p>
<p>The Art ban was particularly funny because OP posted a picture of some strange anti-Trump thing and said he stayed up all night doing it.  I called that behavior and obsession weird and BOOM...banned.</p>

<p>&rt;<strong>Methodology</strong>: For this report, MRC analysts reviewed every mention of President Trump and former Vice President Biden from June 1 through July 31, including weekends, on ABC’s <em>World News Tonight</em>, the <em>CBS Evening News</em> and <em>NBC Nightly News</em>. To determine the spin of news coverage, our analysts tallied all explicitly evaluative statements about Trump or Biden from either reporters, anchors or non-partisan sources such as experts or voters. Evaluations from partisan sources, as well as neutral statements, were not included.<br>
As we did in 2016, we also separated personal evaluations of each candidate from statements about their prospects in the campaign horse race (i.e., standings in the polls, chances to win, etc.). While such comments can have an effect on voters (creating a bandwagon effect for those seen as winning, or demoralizing the supports of those portrayed as losing), they are not “good press” or “bad press” as understood by media scholars as far back as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Over-Wire-TV-CBS-Campaign/dp/0871547228"><strong>Michael Robinson’s groundbreaking research</strong></a> on the 1980 presidential campaign.</p>

<li>You didn’t link the study you linked a right leaning media sources analysis of the study. </li>
<li>The “study” which you didn’t even link properly ONLY analyzed news reports from three left leaning media corporations coverage of trump who SUPRISE SUPRISE aired negatively biased news against him. Who would have thought that left leaning news sources negatively covered trump?? Not me that’s for sure. Let’s not pretend that nbc, CBC and abc are the only media sources in the US. This study comes nowhere close to reflecting the overall media’s portrayal of either Biden or trump, because that would be close to impossible to quantify. My original post was about how trump is part of the elite and that he has his own echo chamber of new sources that parrot positive news for himself, and I realize that the Democrats have their own media circus doing the same thing for Biden.</li>

<p>I mean, <strong>I know</strong> ABC, NBC and CBS are all in the tank for Biden.  The results I posted display that clearly.  These are the three biggest major networks that are beaming biased, negative anti-Trump messages into American households nonstop.  That's.  The.  Point.</p>

        <p>He was born into ridiculous wealth, his dad basically gave him almost half a billion dollars (in today's dollars), he made his money (or really, lost money, as he would be more rich had he just invested into an index fund) in NYC real estate, mostly on defrauding the working stiff. He's basically just used the presidency to enrich himself and protect his cronies.</p>

        <p>First, his net worth is tied up in a lot of things that took a dump during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, he was up 100 million dollars.</p>
<p>Second, if his net worth should have gone done 400 million, but instead it only went down 200 million due to his enriching himself, he's 200 million dollars richer than he would have been. This is "enriching" yourself, unless you think that being 200 million dollars richer than you would have been is not being enriched.</p>
<p>You are being distracted by the ebb and flow of net worth, and not his actions. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/09/04/trump-presidency-spawns-conflicts-of-interest-personal-profits-column/2197263001/">Which are clearly that of a person using the office to enrich themselves.</a></p>

Trump has major stock in oil, look at that disgraceful pipeline project, desecrating the land and pissing on americas true minority, the real americans, the natives.

<p>In other words, one part of the brain wants freedom of speech while the other part of the brain wants primitive tribalism. They do not have the ability to introspect and observe the discrepancy with respect to their overall actions on a daily basis.</p>
