        <p>The problem is when you cite Scientific studies that go against mainstream, they get discredited as "conspiracies." Those people literally ignore the studies you cite. I had a friend tell me today we are too dumb to even cite this data and should just listen to experts rather than look at contradicting studies. We simply don't have the knowledge to look at the data and studies that are available to us. Just comply, no questions</p>

        <p>Well that's them falling short of following the same advice isn't it? You see ignorance in all circles unfortunately. It is difficult to challenge culture but I try to embrace respect and openness to learning. There is nothing wrong with admitting we are wrong when presented with data contrary to our views; likewise there is nothing wrong with challenging the data if there seem to be grounds to do so.</p>

        <p>Yep, unfortunately, from what I've seen, they choose to ignore any science you present to the contrary. There's a notion that people that don't believe masks work or have questions about the vaccine or question the effectiveness of lockdowns, are simply dumb and use memes and opinion pieces as sources. I had someone use the argument today that their opinion is more qualified and they have the freedoms to make their choices because they know doctors lmao. This person told me not to question the experts but talked about an instance where they were denied service due to no mask but it's okay, because in their opinion, it was safe. They're qualified because they know doctors and my opinion doesn't matter due to not having medical knowledge so I can't cite Scientific papers. It's hypocrisy</p>

        <p>And you've circled quite nicely back to my original point there. If all the wider community sees on the side against mask-wearing are "memes and opinion pieces" then any good argument to be made is pre-invalidated by the community bias against this view: they've already decided it's going to be nonsense. But continually present only transparent, bias-balanced data from respected experts in their field, and be open to discussion around the conclusions and potential biases, it will become less and less difficult over time to be taken seriously. The top posts on this sub are memes and screenshots of headlines - these are very easy to brush aside, whatever your view is.</p>

        <p>Well, sadly, if someone is continually disrespecting your voice then they might not ever be open to that discussion. Or at least not until a serious amount of time has passed such that they can emotionally detach from their biases. I'm not a fan of censorship but it might make you happier not to engage in such discussions with them for a while. Just be careful not to repeat until you end up in an echo chamber!</p>

        <p>So all scientists were saying that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no evidence that wearing masks slows down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, therefore general population <strong>should not</strong> be wearing masks, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no evidence that washing hands slows down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, therefore general population <strong>should</strong> be washing hands, and</p>

<p>There is no evidence that staying 6 feet apart slows down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, therefore people <strong>should</strong> stay 6 feet apart</p>

        <p>Whether intentional or not, you've strengthened my point. Peer review and transparency are among the strongest tools we have against bias. </p>
<p>Nothing is unbiased but as long as the biases are presented and attempts are made to account for them, then we can see how conclusions were determined and make our own decisions to agree with them or not.</p>

        <p>Please, whataboutery and cherry-picking will only frustrate your audience. <em>If</em> there is a point of discussion without scientific consensus (what specifically did you have in mind when you proposed this scenario?) then obviously you've none other than to apply critical thinking, pick a view, <em>and</em> clearly refer to the evidence available, while being open to discussion.</p>

        <p>I’ve provided a many of people with peer-reviewed articles and data - most on the other side do not care to read anything that doesn’t support their confirmation biases. They’re so far gone they think <em>i’m</em> the conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely, but a much stronger argument can be made by referring directly to a medical study, compared with the media outlets who convert said findings into a sensationalist headline for ad revenue. That way you're not engaging in Chinese whispers, plus you can read up on the authors and their other work.</p>
