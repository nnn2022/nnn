    <strong>College "Virtual" Graduate Rant</strong>
    <p><p>I just graduated college and it does not even feel like it. I spent tons of time and money to have my name put into a "virtual graduation". All it was is my name thrown up on to a powerpoint. That is it. I don't even know when I actually get my diploma. I asked and they said it will be mailed to me. I can kiss that goodbye. I decided to watch a bit of the video afterwards and saw Chuck "Trump's Erection" Schumer talking about how the new administration will clean up what the last 4 years did wrong for this nation and he promises to remove 50,000 in student debt. They even managed to make this political</p>
<p>Also there was an additional awards ceremony that was made "virtual" and for this one it was only 20 minutes long and it was the college staff just talking about how hard corona was and all this shit, then at they end they were like oh yeah here is a link to the award winners by. I won 4 fucking awards and didnt even know about it. These fuckers raised tuition and couldnt even give me a real graduation or anything. Its okay, they had COVID shots at the campus where thousands of people came to the campus every day.</p></p>

<p>I'd love to see them wipe out student debt. Basically to see the salt-flow from everyone with a useless degree when they get a 1099-C from the IRS.</p>

        <p>To be fair, diplomas are usually mailed far after the graduation date. I graduated in 2017 and I didn't get my diploma for a couple months after.</p>
