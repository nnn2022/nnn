        <p>I was pro 15 days to slow the spread. I was okay with the first month of lockdown, but that was back when we didn't know much of anything and thought the virus could have a 5% IFR. Now with probably a 1% IFR or less, and far less for the young, this is just crazy.</p>

        <p>In my PA county the doomers and COVID Karens are screaming for more rules and another shutdown. Somehow, after eight months of this, they haven’t learned that more restrictions will only DELAY cases. We will still get them. Yet they want additional nonsensical restrictions anyway. </p>
<p>Besides I’m not sure what else we can restrict. No businesses are at 100% capacity that we can scale back. It’s getting too cold now to shut down indoor dining again. There’s already no bar seating. Curfews are pointless. What do people want? I’m guessing they want the authoritarian Australia or Italy-style lockdowns that would never fly in America.</p>

        <p>Those only worked temporarily as well. Cases in Italy are rising again. If the idea is just to keep playing whackamole with this thing for the sake of “flattening the curve” over and over then no. Fuck that. Corona is not as deadly to the public as lockdowns are.</p>

        <p>I really don’t understand why we can’t do that now. </p>
<p>I feel like (and I know other posts on here in the past have confirmed it, as has talking to my family about it) that it’s because we have work from home, social media to virtue signal and better access to grocery delivery and the like. If we were in the early 2000s, we’d almost be forced to keep living because we wouldn’t have those amenities. Now we can just all stay home forever cause it’s so easy when you have Netflix and Amazon, so stop complaining! /s</p>

        <p>&rt;What do people want? I’m guessing they want the authoritarian Australia or Italy-style lockdowns that would never fly in America</p>
<p>That's what they want. They want infected people under house-arrest with ankle bracelets so the government can monitor their movements. They want to require permission slips to leave your house. They want rolling lockdowns where only certain zip codes are allowed to participate in "essential" activity once a week. They want to enforce mask wearing as soon as you leave your front door.</p>
<p>These people, who watch CNN constantly, actually think the virus will just go away if we lock down hard enough. They don't realize it's a <em>global</em> pandemic, they think it's just the backward, idiot United States that's infected still.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  I want to put my foot down and declare "We're moving", but she'd resent me for it big time.  I've seen two couples I know get divorced over this same "Husband forced us to move to the country" thing.  It has to get so bad that SHE wants to to move, which is why I haven't sold the property yet.  I'm hoping that she comes around eventually.</p>

        <p>If I didn't have an absolutely amazing wife, I'd put my foot down, too. </p>
<p>But there are some things where I'm leaving no matter what because <em>I'll</em> become so miserable that staying would be as bad as leaving. I'm not sure we're not there already. </p>
<p>She actually is willing to move to another state... we just can't agree on which state, or the area in that state (and having started a new job recently, I realistically can't do anything until next summer at the earliest). Frustrating, because she has come to see the restrictions as stupid and nonsensical. I just think her top choice is too vulnerable to being overrun by the same stupidity.  </p>
<p>It is tough to get people to actually <em>do</em> something other than complain. <em>I've</em> been going to anti-shutdown and anti-restriction rallies, not that my crap-sack state has managed to have many.</p>

        <p>How many times in your former life did you hear someone comment "There's a nasty bug going around" and your response was to nod and go about your life?  Maybe you'd put some hand sanitizer in your coat pocket and remember to use it once in a while.  That was sanity.  What we're living through now is insanity.</p>
<p>FFS, my wife works as a school administrator.  I can recall a few times when she'd comment "Yeah, something nasty is going around. Kids are dropping like flies. Mrs. Whatserface has 4 kids out sick, etc."  And it was just idle conversation.  If I had described the 2020 distance learning nightmare and suggested that as a course of action, I'd have been laughed at.</p>

        <p>I agree, based on what we now know. Back in February/March we didn't really know that much though and it looked like it had the potential to be really bad, like what happened in Italy. Then we realized the vast majority of people who get the virus don't even realize it and that many early deaths were due to inexperience and incompetence at handling the virus.</p>

        <p>In Feb/March there were truckloads of people suffering through "something nasty out there...but it ain't teh virus because they haven't been to China"...in May the same doctors concluded the "something nasty..." was actually early COVID cases, but w/o testing there's no way of knowing.</p>

        <p>&rt; Now I’m like ehhhhhh if this is gonna last years like... fuck it I’m gonna do what I want and opt out of anything society is gonna pressure me to do.</p>
<p>Every rational person arrives at this point, it's simply a matter of how long it takes.  For me it was 3 or 4 weeks, for others it was a few or several months.  But everyone comes to the same conclusion eventually.</p>
<p>This is why I like telling people "The masks are forever."  It jolts them out of the day-to-day, "just a little longer" mindset and makes them think "But I don't want to wear the mask forever! I didn't sign up for this!"</p>

        <p>Permanence is not a problem if there is no enforcement. People simply ignore it like half of the USA does.</p>
<p>We in EU have a bit different rulebook, you can act like a fool, and you'll get a fine as a reward. It was 400€ to 4000€ here but I guess it was not effective enough and will need to be raised with added jail time to make even the "smartest" understand. UK and IT already raised it well over 10.000€ for the dumbest to make them smarter.</p>

        <p>You get help by forcibly putting yourself in situations where you socialize with people. </p>
<p>It also helps if you look people in the eyes. If you can see their eyes you can judge their response, usually you mimic people who surround you. Social Anxiety is horrible because anxious people will not make eye contact and subconciously do weird things, people notice this and act distance themselves. Anxious people see people distancing and become more nervous. It's a vicious cycle.</p>

        <p>Eye contact in many species is a sign of aggression. That might have something to do with it. If anything, I feel a sense of relief when most people avert their gaze or keep their distance, and I dislike most other people the more I socialize with them because it seems most of them are bootlickers waiting to happen. And no, I don't support social distancing orders even though I sure as hell don't mind voluntary social distancing. I don't like government/corporate overreach because government officials and corporate executives are people too.</p>

        <p>I was actually much more lonely and jealous of other people's happiness at the start and height of covid19 lockdowns than I'd ever been in my life. I was a single person living in a new city where I didn't have friends. Pre-lockdowns, though, I was optimistic about my ability to make new friends. Then the lockdowns hit. The media propaganda said "we're all in this together" which was a complete lie: nearly everyone around me was hoarding toilet paper. The media also said we were all cooped up "with our families" which I didn't have. I would look at my social media and be confronted with posts from people declaring that lockdowns were a great opportunity to slow down and cherish our loved ones, yeah right. Posts from parents making cute craft shit with their kids. My pain was censored because it didn't fit the narrative. </p>
<p>After a lot of looking, I found a new group of friends with which to meet in person and enjoy life. This was possible because lockdowns were partially relaxed during the summer, and because our group is happy to ignore media warnings about house parties and show up at underground club parties. There is no way in hell I'd go back to the total isolation of this spring. If anyone with social anxiety wants a wingperson to help them, I'm happy to help, but none of these fuckers has the right to moralize to us.</p>

        <p>I felt similar to you. I felt angry at all of my friends who were privileged enough to have happy marriages and families, and live in nice houses, to “stop being selfish” when they were the ones who could share pictures and happy statuses of the fun they were having with their families while parroting “We’re all in this together.” Yet no one cared about me, living alone in a one bedroom apartment, except my mom who told me “Don’t worry about what people say to you; you’re still welcome at my house.” It really felt like everyone else was having a good time and baking bread and having Zoom happy hours but me. (I never thought I would mind the virtual stuff but I ended up resenting it.)</p>

        <p>Meetup app. Most of my former groups went to virtual garbage but with enough combing through I was able to find in person events. There's this group that was doing beach parties for most of the summer, while the beach parties aren't happening anymore they started up a discord to keep people informed of other cool local events, including some underground raves. If you're in SoCal pm me and I'll send you the link.</p>

        <p>Not always true.</p>
<p>I've suffered from loneliness and anxiety for most of my life. I've been single and miserable for 5.5 years now, and felt jealousy every time I saw couples and families in real life or wedding photos online. This year's horror show has made everything worse. I've never felt deeper loneliness and despair. I've been longing for love and emotional security and a family of my own for many years now, and this nightmare made it a lot more difficult than before to achieve. I've been strongly against the dystopian police state restrictions, the masks and everything else since mid-late April\start of May. This whole thing made me realize my true personality is actually pretty social and outgoing - but my awkward, anxious nature just makes it hard for me.</p>
<p>Too many people have shown themselves to be hostile, hate-filled hypocrites. They downright mock depression and downplay the significance of the increasing suicide rates. They claim to be selfless and compassionate, supporting house arrests and mask mandates to save the elderly. It doesn't matter if the elderly aren't interested in this nightmare either, if they miss their families and don't want to die alone. And of course, it doesn't matter to them if the elderly suffer from the violent "demonstrations" they so passionately defended this summer. Millions of lives are destroyed because of the insane authoritarian measures they supported every step of the way. Isolation and turning neighbors against each other was "necessary" - but Biden celebrations are allowed because science. And yet, supposedly I'm the "selfish Nazi" for wanting to socialize and breath fresh air.</p>
<p>A lot of the assholes referring to us as "selfish Nazis" and similar stuff already have husbands and families and nice homes. Of course this whole thing isn't going to hurt them as much as it hurts lonely girls like me with no families or nice homes with gardens.</p>

        <p>Personally it isn't helping me. My therapist agrees that I will likely be single forever and need to accept that. Also that it is "too dangerous" (physical health wise) for me to be dating unless I'm doing zoom only. </p>
<p>She also recommended wearing earbuds and listening to tunes in public 24/7 when I shared that I was having anxiety over seeing people in masks, especially men, so that I would "notice it less". </p>
<p>The last round of therapy I had pre March was really helpful but not things you can do under covid rules (involved (platonic) touching and small talk with strangers).</p>

        <p>Exactly! I came in to say something similar.
I’ve always been an introverted person jealous of other people socializing and having fun happy lives. I’ve been against all restrictions from the beginning. None of this makes me feel better, it makes me feel angry and hopeless.</p>

        <p>I could have written this. I started 2020 feeling perfectly fine with being single, just off of a breakup with a toxic ex, and hopeful to hang out with friends and date new people. Now it's a completely different story. I'll be 25 in two weeks and I'm in therapy working on the idea that I'm never going to have a relationship again, which my therapist thinks is reasonable and healthy. </p>
<p>It's a daily struggle to not cry about pictures of weddings and families and have real i***l hours here on reddit and I don't know how it's ever going to get better.</p>

        <p>You're young my friend. When I was 25 I was a wreck. An anxious, nervous, depressed, hypochondriac , suicidal mess. I moved to Alaska from Alberta for a while to get my shit together. Didn't happen. Just got more fucked up. I had a decent job but came back because the drugs up there had me by the balls. I moved back, layed floors for a long time, met a beautiful lady back in 1986 and still couldn't get my shit together. I got into fixing up old houses about 6 years later. Quit the drinking and the drugs and the self hatred, and at about 40 I found some peace. Couple of kids now, older house in a nice neighborhood. At 25, I didn't think that I would have made it another year let alone 40. Hang in there.</p>

        <p>This reads like it was written by a skeptic trying to take down the doomers but it’s great motivation to hang in there and go back to my usual active, extroverted, socially fulfilling life. In 2019 I had no idea that there were people who felt this way about people like me.</p>

        <p>Kind of riding the doomer/skeptic fence here...the reason why I go on subs like this is to hear the non-doomer side.  I'd have probably gone full-on skeptic except for my idiot tendency to go "yeah but what if???"  Most of what's being pumped out by tEh ScIeNcE feeds that "what if" mentality.</p>
