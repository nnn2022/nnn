    <strong>Medical Segregation has come home to me, red States aren't safe.</strong>
    <p><p>I live out in the sticks WV.. Our entire county has had like 30 people reportedly die of the virus this whole time... So through last summer the restrictions were tense. The only store in town would only let 20 people in at a time so we dealt with literal Black Friday level lines in the heat.. all the small businesses closed and were replaced with chain stores. One poor soul was going to open a gas station and it was to open in March 2020, now it's a 7-11...</p>
<p>Police cerfews, mask mandates, school closings. The works. I was employed the entire time, I refused the checks. I keep them framed on my wall with a note that says 'this is all they think you're worth'</p>
<p>Last fall everyone stopped caring? Winter seemed common sense to mask thru bc it was flu season, but since this March I rarely see a person with a mask. Except for people trying to survive their shift. It's kind of infuriating. Forcing workers to "PrOviDE A SaFe EnvIrOnMenT" from something that doesn't effect us. Dangling normalcy in front of workers through the vaccine. Subconsciously creating a slave caste.</p>
<p>Happens at my job too. I work in a factory where it's 90+ degrees every day. I wear a mask. They claimed that once a certain percentage is vaccinated we don't have to anymore. Won't say what percentage. Free vax clinics on site every day. I work by myself with nobody around me for a hundred feet lifting and pulling and doing all kinds of manual work. Ten hours a day. Six days a week. Masked. No masks in the break room tho, it can't get you if you're on lunch I think. Actually that seems to be true everywhere, maybe the science is settled?</p>
<p>I struggle to breathe every day, and I ask why and only hear 'its company policy'. Higher ups sit in their AC offices without a mask.</p>
<p>Now the hammer has finally fallen. "If you can prove you're vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. We'll put a sticker on your ID, and then you don't have to"</p>
<p>I'm not being blackmailed into doing with my body what I don't want to do. I'm sure 2 weeks from now there'll be vaxxed and unvaxxed break rooms too.</p>
<p>All my coworkers are already GMOs, so I'll feel left out but I won't waver. My entire family is vaxxed and I'm worried about them....</p>
<p>Things feel like they're about to be rougher than they already was. Tbh I feel entirely demoralized but at least it's them with a yellow star and not me, for now at least. I want to just walk into the woods and have a hunting accident, but then there'd be one less freedom fighter in the world.....</p></p>

        <p>Thank ya. One of my ex-friends (unrelated to political ordeals) became a work-from-home-er and there's definitely a lot of tension between people like him and people like me in these parts. I like the phrase "laptop caste" I guess I'm part of the "at-risk caste" Sounds kind of like Brave New World.</p>
<p>Sometimes it feels as if the people at home want to prolong this because they don't want to return to an office job and that causes a heap of resentment in me.... As if sitting in an office is too dangerous, but being around thousands of pounds of raw chickens every day isn't? I'd kill to work in the comfort of my own home.</p>
<p>But I try to be empathetic, and I can imagine the blur between work and home is just as hellish. Never being totally off the clock, boss is only an email or a phone call away. My dad use to call that a "fireman job" i.e. you're always on call and expected to perform.</p>
<p>I pray that the corporate types lording over you don't just outsource your job to India or something once this is over. This world has become so unfair towards the working class while the richest get richer....</p>

        <p>Yeah I definitely work with a few people who wouldn't mind working from home indefinitely for reasons of comfort.</p>
<p>That said though, I know that for even the most extreme lockdowner colleagues and friends I have, that's not the reason why they keep advising caution and resisting opening up.</p>
<p>The genuine reason for them is that they are 100% in the "scientists urge caution so we must all obey to save lives and avoid catastrophe" camp. Based on some of my friends' reactions to me, they also think that resistance to the restrictions could only come from conspiracy theorists and Trump supporters.</p>
<p>It's very sad and very worrying to me really.. Individual rights, liberty, personal responsibly, resisting state overreach, opposition to mass coercion and systematic discrimination. All this seems to have no meaning whatsoever to them, at least not in the face of what they see as the world destroying covid threat that makes it all irrelevant.</p>
<p>And yeah you're right about the laptop life so to speak. It has its advantages, but it's genuinely driving me insane. Really does feel like all work and no play all the time...</p>

        <p>Man, I'm in California and things never got that bad where I live.  Newsom did the curfew but all the sheriffs and police chiefs basically told him to go fuck himself and they weren't going to enforce it.  (minor exceptions here and there of course).  Last Summer, I went on a road trip out of California and travelled through Navada, Utah, Wyoming, and finally to South Dakota.  The ONLY time through this whole scamdemic, I ever had anybody freak out on me about masks was in Utah, a red state.  I don't think I've ever had someone in California freak out on me, and they don't even enforce it in the county I'm in.  Sorry for your shitty situation bud.  I know this must be difficult for you.  I can't stand people who think they're above everybody else like that.  I'd plan on telling the manager to go fuck himself in front of all the other workers and just leave like a G.  Life is too goddam short and I swear the memory of doing something like that will continue to pay dividends well into old age.</p>

        <p>Real shit coming from Commiefornia :p</p>
<p>See, we went so hard on restrictions because our county has a real youth brain-drain happening, average age is like 50 here. And the police will write tickets for anything and everything around our podunk town because that's how they get their funding... They drive these sick ass 2018 Dodge Chargers while there's potholes in the road, ya know what I mean?</p>
<p>So they jumped on the opportunity last year but thank God they've since calmed their dumb asses down. </p>
<p>I'd flip the hell out on my bosses but in town we got 2 factories, some fast food joints, like 3 gas stations, and a walmart in terms of employment and I've already worked at pretty much all of them since I started working at 16, and Im in the highest pay grade in town so it's too damn hard to give that financial comfort up.. It's a war of attrition and as long as there's some stubborn motherfuckers still out there who won't give up their body autonomy, well we won't lose, I hope.</p>

        <p>While not completely acceptable, you can do a little bit about it to make it better.  </p>
<p>You should first find out what he corporate policy says.  Does it say "follow CDC guidance" or "following state mandates"?</p>
<p>If it is state mandates, on June 20th complain that the governor's mandate isn't being followed (the day masks can go away in WV for everyone).  It may work, but they can just say they are using the more restrictive CDC guidance still.</p>
<p>If they are "following the CDC guidance", then you can refer to this page <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/general-business-faq.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/general-business-faq.html</a> under the section "When is a cloth face covering not appropriate while at work, and what can employees wear instead?"  OSHA recommends a face shield in <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3990.pdf">https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA3990.pdf</a> for employees who can't  tolerate a mask in their work environment.</p>
<p>While not a perfect fix, a more breathable face shield sounds like a much better alternative than a mask for you.  </p>
<p>They should not be able to fight you on the CDC and OSHA recommendations if they state they are following them in their policies.</p>

<p>There's forklifts zoomin around everywhere and sometimes I operate one, wearing a mask that fogs up safety glasses is exponentially more dangerous than giving some one a minor cold that I don't even have</p>

        <p>The bosses there sounds like dicks on a power trip. They obviously believe they are in full power to enforce this however they want.  Safety violations are a huge deal though. If you get injured because you can’t see due to the mask, or have a heat stroke, those assholes are still liable. </p>
<p>Start protecting yourself now. Each time you report a possible safety issue, make a short note of date, time, who you told, and a few words on what you reported was unsafe. Record each time you ask about the mask policies as well. If another worker can be present when you talk to someone, that’s even better. </p>
<p>If you do get injured (or another worker does), find a personal or workplace injury lawyer. Show them the logs and they should be able to get something done.</p>
