        <p>It's February 2nd.  </p>
<p>41,302 Americans have died of Covid since Biden took office.  At this rate, he'll beat Trump's covid death count by April 26th.  Wow.</p>

        <p>Whoa now, don't go starting a conspiracy that Trump cooked up this virus in a Wuhan lab, ya kook.  Is that what you meant by starting a fire?</p>
<p>It's an airborne virus, what do you want, a plastic bubble for every person?  Trump could have made every right move and half the country would have defied him out of spite, and the results would have been the same.  If Trump is culpable for COVID deaths (makes no sense, but OK), then so is his successor.  </p>
<p>Or you can leave both presidents out of it, everyone can take command of their own health outcome, and we can get back to living.</p>

        <p>It turns out he was also lying about it being dangerous. He lies about a lot of things. So did Fauci. Let’s split the blame 60/40, Trump gets the big part. Now Fauci is responsible for about 160,000 deaths.</p>

        <p>Lies, truths, what does it matter when you are trying to blame an airborne virus on a person?  It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  If you think blaming deaths under Biden isn't fair, apply the same thinking to everyone who did not create the virus in a lab.  You think it's not man made?  Good, now blame God for acts of God like we've always done, and move on with your life.  The only thing worse than a Trump sycophant is a raging anti-Trumper.</p>

        <p>Thousands upon thousands of lifes. A bunch who died not believing that the virus was even real because Trump made fun of the safety protocols given by people who actually knew what they were talking about. </p>
<p>People aren't blaming Biden not only because he's been in power for not even a month but because even when he had no power he was doing everything the experts were telling people to do.</p>
<p>If you can't see the difference between Trump and Biden then thats because Trump's dick is so far in your throat that all you can see is his stomach.</p>

        <p>I'm no Trump fan, pronghorn97, but you are correct about the second paragraph.</p>
<p>Truth is that CoVid-19 is majority killing the old, infirm and very low on certain vitamins/minerals.</p>
<p>Nothing Trump nor Biden can do to stop that in the real world other than encourage old and infirm people to stay home and sequester themselves until this virus disappears or we have a SAFE non-mRNA vaccine to vaccinate against it.</p>

        <p>Except trump encouraged everyone to do just the opposite. I don’t think anyone disagrees with the fact that the most affected people are old and at risk, but what people don’t seem to understand is that Trump is still to blame for the high number of deaths we got. Look at Italy, they had a huge outbreak early on, even before it got bad in America. But they went into lockdown quickly and they stopped it. When the same thing happened to America what did we do? Scrapped together a lockdown that we didn’t prepare for (despite scientists warning about it far in advance) and thanks to Trump’s discouragement of that, we did it so poorly that almost a YEAR later we’re still not done with the first WAVE.</p>

        <p>It seems like you’re saying that, if Trump had acted in an undemocratic and totalitarian way(which everyone would have hated) that Americans would have listened, and it would have saved lives. This assumes that the lockdowns work, which is not true, and that they do more good than harm, which is also not true.  Let go of the fantasy that you can put the blame for an airborne virus on anyone other than who created it.  In the unlikely case it’s not man made, blame God.</p>

        <p>Yep, here in Australia we haven't had a covid related death since December 29, and before that the last death was on November 30. Two deaths, one month apart, compared to the US which had 1950 deaths of the 1st of February and 1864 deaths the day before that. </p>
<p>Life is pretty much back to normal here, but I constantly hear on this sub it's nothing to worry about and the yare handling it well.</p>

        <p>Australia’s covid response means nothing to any other country. Talk about an outlier. Australia’s population is less than just Texas while being roughly the same in square footage (minus Alaska).</p>
<p>Australia has one of the lowest population densities in the world and you can’t act like that doesn’t play a factor in the spreading of an airborne virus. Stop mentioning Australia in talks of the virus and how great the response was because nobody gives a shit, and it doesn’t compare to almost any other country in the world.</p>

        <p>Ok, well you're right, Australia does not have the same population density, not denying that didn't help. So lets compare California to South Korea. South Korea's size is 100,210 km² and California's is 423,970 km². California has a population of 39.51 million, and South Korea's is 51.71 million. So despite these differences I think they are roughly the same, but it's not perfect I know, but for this comparison it works. </p>
<p>South Korea currently has had a total of 1,441 deaths and a total of 79,311 cases, whereas California has has a total of 41,581 deaths and a total of 3.35 million cases. </p>
<p>So, a country that has a smaller land mass and a higher population has less cases and less deaths than just one US state. Clearly there is something more that California could be doing to stop this. It can't just be business as usual.</p>

        <p>No I'm pretty sure its because most of the people in Australia know how to handle covid. Also if all of those people in Texas actually stayed inside instead of going in so many parties, they could have tried and atleast reduce it.</p>

        <p>We do have our fair share of anti-makers and anti-lockdowners too, but luckily they are very much in the minority. Daniel Andrews, premier of Victoria coped a lot of criticism from the right-wing media here for implementing a very strict lockdown when Melbourne, saying this would end his career. </p>
<p>Well, when they got the cases under control a poll revealed his popularity was actually really high. It was hilarious watching the right-wing media try to work out why he was still popular when they spent months saying he would be kicked out.</p>

        <p>1) Trump tweeted that there is link between vacciness and autism and that doctors are spreading autism in american population.   </p>
<p>2) Masks aresimpliest way to slow down spread of virus - how is possible that you are mad that pandemic (and thus actions against it) never ends, but you are against masks? 
Anti-maskers are against science - there isnt any normal reason to be against masks. <br>
If someone has fucked up health and he cant wear mask - what tf is that person doing outside during pandemic? </p>
<p>3)  "0.003%"
This is only for tenagers.
But ok i will asume that this istrue for every group younger than 50 years. </p>
<p>You just said that:
+ older peopke doesnt deserve to live because you dint want wear mask
+ that we can accept risk of healthcare collaps and causing deaths of other people with different diseases.   </p>
<p>Not talking about british mutation. </p>
<p>4) "doesnt make me anti-vax".</p>
<p>Yea, it does.
Vaccine was tested and it doesnt have any unregular side effect on average population.  There can be alergic reaction in 1:1M. </p>
<p>So yea, if you are agsinst vaccine just because you are scared and without evidence - you are antivax.</p>
<p>5) "Its not vaccine"
It is vaccine by definition. Vaccine is substance that is stimulating production of antibodies.  </p>
<p>No it is not gene therapy, it doesnt modify dna of human cells.  </p>
<p>Actually, do you even know how thatvaccine works? </p>
<p>6) Irony that you called me sociopath while you support sacrifice of eldery to diseasse  because you are against mask mandate.</p>

        <p>I mean, one president said the virus would be gone in a few weeks with only 15 cases, then said the (((liberal elite reptile fake news media))) was making the virus sound worse because they wanted it to turn into a pandemic. He then proceeded to slowly watch it turn into an actual pandemic whilst denying the severity, leaving the handling in the hands of states, withholding aid to states like California and Michigan because they hurt his feelies all while downplaying the contagiousness of the disease before letting it get so bad that he blew trillions of dollars in a matter of weeks in the name of “fiscal responsibility” because the economy crashed. And then he pretended he created a bunch of jobs after a few of them came back from the crash that he caused. </p>

        <p>You misplaced commas, used personal insults, the unholy amount of projection you said, and the internet keyboard warrior you are. I’m positive that you’re a Trump supporter so you saying anything about someone’s looks or living conditions is a massive lack of self awareness. Get out of your mom’s basement, stop raping your cousin sister, and take a shower.
