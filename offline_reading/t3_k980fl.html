    <strong>On a path of loneliness/destruction</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, Im an occasional lurker on these threads and don't normally comment on things but there is something weighing on my heart 
This "new global reset", the suffering of small business owners and we as citizens of this so called "free nation" (America) go through day in and day out with this virus bs when were all trying to live our lives 
The higher ups just close their eyes and ears, they look away and are always lying so they can guarantee their place in the NWO or not be exposed 
The vaccine is on the way and we all know what it's going to do to everyone...I want to have hope but I don't  know My boyfriend isn't really deep into this like I am so  he tells me to not obsess over this so much Imagine being 24 starting your life as an adult and know your life ahead will be filled with abuse and control for more decades to come, no free thought, no will, no nothing</p></p>

        <p>I get you... I'm 30 and I have an autistic 6yr old, and a husband. Its downright scary to be quite honest, and very depressing. </p>
<p>Its sad but this is only the beginning, sadly it will get worse.</p>

        <p>My advice: try to focus on creation, exercise, meditation, and other positive aspects of life to occupy you. Don't obsess because there's only so much we can do, but pay attention, and try to find like-minded individuals to share with and relate to. I have lost a couple friends (at least temporarily) because I was obsessing, and they weren't prepared to consider that any of what I had to say could be the truth. Just one non-judgmental person you can talk to from time to time, who will truly listen, can make a world of difference (and make you feel sane again!). Don't share info aggressively, but by asking what others think of it, to hopefully raise some suspicion. Don't self-destruct, we need people like you :)</p>

        <p>Welcome to the boat. I would not have been prepared for this time, except my world has been shattered loads of scary times before. I thought I was losing it when I was in those bad times. Being bullied as a teen and having to eat my lunch in a bathroom stall, or eating top ramen on thanksgiving as a single parent with my kid watching the same freaking 10 DVD's over and over in a studio apartment. </p>
<p>I have had beautiful champagne brunch on the beach in Maui and saw my child graduate from a lovely private college. And I have driven a beat up Honda, and also a Benz. The only thing I can tell you, is that THINGS WILL ALWAYS CHANGE.</p>
<p>It seems hard to imagine, but they do. The world still has good in it. It is like a wave, and we have to hang on!</p>
