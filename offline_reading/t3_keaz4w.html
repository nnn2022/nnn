        <p>But they'll tell you that the reason for the spike is that people are not cooperating. What people? Normally they'll probably blame it on the kids. But compliance is through the roof and growing. Not only compliance, but doing more than they are told to do.</p>

        <p>Well, there's also the California girls/guys like me who've been partying every chance we get. But I think overall this is what happened:</p>
<p>1) people said, "hey the BLM protesters turned out ok, it's summer, fuck it, we'll be good if we just hang out outside." Thus you see a bump, which is the real covid "2nd wave". It goes down as people start developing some herd immunity.</p>
<p>2) Flu season and cold season happened as they do every winter, except these days flu has magically disappeared. Thus the huge skyrocket in cases recently.</p>

        <p>I saw a cashier at walmart wearing 3 masks layered on her face. And she wore cheap gloves and just kept sanitizing them after each customer.</p>

        <p>They will never admit it. </p>
<p>To do so would be to admit that they’ve been brainwashed like the weak, gullible sheep that they are.</p>
<p>They have dug in so hard for so long in the face of such irrationality that they have left themselves no choice but to bow down until social media tells them they are allowed to get up.</p>

        <p>&rt;<strong>What is added by this report?</strong>
&rt;
&rt;The number of COVID-19 cases in Arizona stabilized and then decreased after sustained implementation and enforcement of statewide and locally enhanced mitigation measures, beginning approximately 2 weeks after implementation and enforcement of mask mandates and enhanced sanitations practices began on June 17; further decreases were observed during July 13–August 7, after statewide limitations and closures of certain services and businesses.
&rt;
&rt;<strong>What are the implications for public health practice?</strong>
&rt;
&rt;Widespread implementation and enforcement of sustained community mitigation measures, including mask wearing, informed by state and local officials’ continual data monitoring and collaboration can help prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the numbers of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Lol yeah that's what we call in the Internet business a major fail. But what else do you expect from the CDC at this point?</p>
