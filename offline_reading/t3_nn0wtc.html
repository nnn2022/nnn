    <strong>Perma Banned from r/COVID19positive ... for being positive.</strong>
    <p><p>So I used to be in the Covid cult, believing everything I was told. I was the kind of guy that got mad at people for not wearing masks. Even when my immune compromised family had extremely mild cases, and my little sister tried killing herself multiple times before and after Covid because of the way the world had become I was still on board with ‘the science’.</p>
<p>But then I tested positive after I thought I had strep. I had a fever for 2 days... a sore throat for 3... and that was it. But here’s the thing, when I was called by the state with a legal order to quarantine that could be enforced by the police and a court order, the positive test hadn’t even come in yet. It wasn’t till the next day after bothering the doctors enough that they were able to produce a positive test. That’s when my illusion was shattered.</p>
<p>I made a post explaining why I changed my mind by catching Covid on r/covid19positive, after all I did factually test positive.</p>
<p>However I was met with constant backlash and people attacking me for three days before I woke up this morning and saw that I’d been perma banned.</p>
<p>In my experience passively challenging a certain opinion isn’t met with such hard criticism and threats as this unless it’s a religious type belief. I mean I know it’s the internet and liking a popsicle flavor is controversial, but I was attacked by both random followers and mods alike. </p>
<p>This was different, their beliefs weren’t rooted on genuine care for the subject or worry about human lives, it was just a matter of needing everyone to agree with them and follow the rituals of wearing a mask and getting a vaccine.</p>
<p>That’s why I can’t reasonably call it anything besides the Covid cult. Following these rules isn’t a matter of fear for their fellow man, it’s a religious near worship of the people making and enforcing them.</p></p>

        <p>Oh wow. I didn't know this. I mean- Aaron. I do know however, from experience, that Reddit is not a place where just anything can be discussed. Happy to see new platforms coming about that will not be facing censorship.
The bottom line is this- we are all adults (mostly) and we should be able to freely discuss ANYTHING. Afterwards: take what you like and leave the rest. Pretty simple.
As it stands now: FB, IG, Twitter and Reddit all have an agenda/ narrative. Really is too bad.</p>

        <p>Hey, I'm unfamiliar with the Aaron suicide story? Would you be open to either elaborating or directing me to a resource to learn more? This sounds important and I have no idea what this is about. And if you're not up for it, no problem, just wanted to ask. Thanks</p>

        <p>it has now also become the standard of marketing for basically all commercial industries. its a big reason why you're not seeing talent anywhere in any mainstream medium.  everything product promotion and it has bled through, onto covert social media avatars.</p>
<p>another thing, basically everyone on youtube involved any kind of product now is paid off by someone and a lot of the times they dont have to say shit.  you wont notice it until the company you depend on fucks up, and you see nothing but silence from all your youtubers saying "hey guys its ya boi drop a link and 20 bucks on the patreon", because they're too afraid to criticize and lose their benefits from the company shilling them out under the table.</p>

        <p>Dude, I read your story, about your little sister and everything.  I can’t believe most of the people in that sub were so callous to you.</p>
<p>And yeah, back when all the emergency stuff was getting put into place, some of us were ringing the bell about how there was no cost/benefit analysis being done, no weighing of the drawbacks to these measures, just a tunnel vision focus on “address this one concern.”  The collateral damage was stuff like your family situation.  If people like your sister had even been discussed in the process, even if the end result was still the same lockdowns and school closings and shit that they ended up doing, at least it would be an acknowledged sacrifice.  Instead, the costs to families like yours were not even weighed.  In the eyes of someone like you, this will now forever be damage done by mass hysteria (or mass manipulation, depending on your worldview).</p>
<p>I’m really sorry.  All this shit is consolidating wealth and power at the very top of society, at the expense of the bottom masses.  And, as always, the biggest costs will go to those that can least afford them, like your family.  For a lot of us, we realized this as it was happening, and now we’re just seeing the damage play out.  It’s fucking sad.  And outraging.</p>
<p>Just remember who did this, which politicians and corporations made this happen, and benefited from the damage to your family.  Don’t forget it the next time the media tries to whip you up in a “you must hate Trump”-type furor.  I know too many people that started to understand how bad things were when they watched the dnc fuck over Bernie in 2016, but quickly forgot it all because “Trump is evil!” took over their attention.</p>
<p>Don’t lose sight of which powerful hands were on the steering wheel that drove us off this cliff.</p>
<p>And no, I’m not talking about a political party.</p>

        <p>They've been literally brainwashed via constant propaganda by 'news' and politicians. The thing about people who have been brainwashed is, they don't know they've been brainwashed.</p>
<p>The thing is, they think they're right, they jump upon anything they think they can disagree with and utterly ignore anything that is contrary to the view they've been force fed.</p>
<p>It's like the old quote, not sure but I think it might be Twain, about how it's very difficult to argue against a smart person, and impossible to argue against an idiot. In this case sometimes previously smart people have been so far brainwashed, that they have become an idiot in their own right.</p>
<p>You managed to break free from the bullshit, well done. Expect more of the same from what we call doomers, they really think they're the smart ones and you the dumb. Some of them will see through it eventually, most won't.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing your story. I hope no one is bothering you from that subreddit. </p>
<p>By the way, with all that's been happening, I'm starting to think now that perhaps immunodeficiency studies and/or pre-conceived notions of immunodeficiency might be used by the pro-covid-vaxx crowds as their methods of guilt-tripping the entire world into taking these rushed out vaccines. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the PCR rapid diagnostic tests are extremely faulty and produce way too many false positives, so if our respective governments have lied this much about the number of cases, then I'm starting to wonder about if the science behind immunodeficiency is accurate or not. I've started questioning everything now.</p>

        <p>Amen to that brother. I don't have cable TV, but from time to time I'll check online to see what CNN or MSNBC is saying, and then go check some independent journalists to see what they're saying, and then somewhere in the middle the truth is there. Sometimes I'll even go to a scientific journal's website to find a very complex paper, and do my best to understand how something works (albeit I still have difficulty in understanding), as I can't trust what any of these lame-stream media outlets say is true. </p>

        <p>You're right, I just remembered one paper was pulled from a prestigious medical journal (can't recall the name now), but it basically said masks don't work, but the next day I couldn't find it. Had to find out through a video from The Last American Vagabond's website that the paper was pulled due to basically not towing the party line.</p>

        <p>Yea a lot about f people say their ‘immune deficient’ because their prone to colds, but at least in my older sisters case I remember her passing out from a flu and was unconscious for a day for the first time when I was 11, and a lot of worse stuff has happened since. We can at least be sure she has issues lol, but people are just running around self diagnosing all over the place, throwing off numbers carelessly.</p>

        <p>My sister got sick and went to the doctor. She tested negative for covid. She also tested negative for strep, but the doctor still wanted to give her meds for strep anyway! Then a few days later, her husband tested positive for covid. Then she want back and tested positive. I'm convinced these tests are completely bunk and inaccurate. </p>
<p>I've heard several cases of people and even nurses sending in unused swab tests and them coming back with positive results, but I have no links or sources for this. With all the PCR nonsense it just would not surprise me at all</p>

        <p>Exactly. These rules are not about keeping people from catching and spreading and dying from COVID.  They are about asserting control.  They want to see if you comply.  Comply now and they know you'll let them do anything to you and your family later.</p>
<p>That is why I comply 100%.  If this is some kind of dry run for something truly scary later, I think it's strategically a smart move to go through the motions of compliance now so they <em>think</em> I'm a sheeple when I'm really not.</p>
<p>So then when the shit goes down they'll be like hey he wore a mask so we don't have to worry about him.  Then I'll be like bam surprise motherfuckers I was just tricking you.</p>

        <p>A lot of them are there to enforce a narrative, I'm not sure if they're paid but there is definitely manipulation going on.</p>
<p>Say for example someone went onto that sub to learn about corona virus and read the stuff they're posting they'd go away thinking the world was coming to an end, it's like "oh shit although I'm not experiencing this and don't really know anyone that is, there's so many people that are" when in reality it's not really happening, it's just propaganda, similar to how comments on twitter are manipulated, same thing happens on reddit.</p>
<p>There's discords that they use to coordinate it off reddit, and there are genuine people on the site as well don't get me wrong, but anything that goes against the narrative is downvoted into oblivion and banned and anything they deem as good is kept up.</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest social media sites in the west outside of facebook, the corona virus subreddit has millions of subscribers and millions more will have seen the posts, there's a narrative being pushed for the past year and a half to enforce the perception that lockdowns are necessary and coronavirus is more serious than it actually is for the vast majority of us.</p>

<p>They’ll go on and on, clutching their pearls at your freedom of choice and signaling their virtue about how much better they are for “trusting the science,” and how terrible you are for not conforming to their belief structure, and then they’ll literally wish death by covid on everyone who isn’t down with their vaccination agenda.</p>

        <p>Everything is a cult these days. Both sides of politics included. We need to stop with the all or nothing thinking. Be independent minded in coming to your own conclusions. One side doesn’t have to be all right or all wrong about everything. Life is more complex than that. Live and let live. We gotta stop blaming sides. Everyone turn off the news and stop being so gullible to this stupid fear they are out here selling. They want us to hate each other. When that happens, we all lose.</p>

        <p>I agree, it would be nice. But we're not in that perfect place free of politics and media lol! If you find it let us know ok? In the meantime we need to stay away from moral relativism. There really is right and wrong, and trying to force others to take poison is wrong.</p>

<p>Everything you said is spot on. The cult sheep are being encouraged to shame and segregate the unvaccinated, and call you a conspiracy theorist if you disagree with their brainwash. I don’t even know where to begin with the ironies and hypocrisies of this reality. In fact, it’s become not ironic anymore.</p>

        <p>It was never about public health. Here in Brazil, the public transport is still running full. They even had the dare to REDUCE the numbers os buses and trains, thinking people would be discouraged to… work? Yeah, because basically all people who uses the public transport during a fucking rush hour are workers, but the politicians and all damn health agencies couldn’t figure it out. </p>
<p>Still, ofc it didn’t worked and they never tried to solve the people being treated as sardines in a can. </p>
<p>Without mentioning the criminalization of other treatments. </p>
<p>So again, it was never about public health.</p>

        <p>Yep. My family got it last April right after I had my baby via C-section. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I only ever had a head cold and lost sense of smell. Kids were fine and hubby had no symptoms. Literally the only reason we found out we had it was because my sister, who lives in the other half of our duplex and works in an lab that tests for the virus, tested positive. She was feverish for two weeks and then was fine. </p>
<p>To think, we wouldn't have even have known we had such a deadly virus had the media not told us how terrible our colds were (and I KNOW it can be bad for some, but not most). </p>
<p>I just feel bad because we bought into the hype and my husband's parents and lots of other people missed out on the birth of our daughter because we bought into the hype. But I guess in our case, we actually did come down with that and I'd rather not spread it to elderly people obviously. </p>
<p>But yeah, OP, I know what you mean about falling for the hype.</p>
