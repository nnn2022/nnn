        <p>They are upset because for a year they virtue signaled to everyone on social media what a hero they are for shaming anti-mask people and if they ever take off their triple mask while driving they know they will lose all their fake friends.

        <p>I have some compassion because the mainstream media has really brainwashed them into believing that them and their loved ones will die from the virus. But their fear takes away our rights. I‚Äôm starting to come across people on Facebook that actually believe that people should be jailed for for refusing the vaccine. I can‚Äôt understand how someone gets to that point. Jailed for how long?! And if your going to put people in jail then how long before your calling for their deaths? Is this another Holocaust in the making? And I feel crazy because no one else in my life can see this slippery slope of our rights being rapidly eroded. Even if I wanted the shot I wouldn‚Äôt believe that I had the right to tell someone else what to do with their own body. Where there is risk there must be choice. And now we don‚Äôt even have the right to breathe freely. The government owns our faces, now they want inside our bodies.</p>

        <p>From the people I've talked to just this weekend, the #1 reason for getting the vaccine among those who did was fear.</p>
<p>I do wonder, right now, if there is also sunk cost fallacy to be added to the list of reasons.</p>

        <p>The #1 problem with many people right now is that they can't take personal responsibility for anything, not even the most basic of things. Blowing money on useless shit? Must be someone else's fault. Overweight? I can't help it. Etc etc. This is why they turn to the government who says they will fix all their problems if they just do what they're told.. Except we've seen for thousands of years that the government can't fix your problems, and certainly isn't fixing anybody's problems by taking things away from them. What I fear is that these people wont accept it until they cause some sort of collapse that forces them to.</p>

        <p>I think you're wrong. That's not how brain-washed works. They don't wish to be doing anything other than what they already are.</p>
<p>One thing I agree with is that it isn't their fault. Some people are just more susceptible to propaganda and are easily manipulated. There are various factors that lead to that susceptibility.</p>

        <p>Many reasons, some if it is down to brainwashing, a loved one dying and being labelled as Covid etc. All pretty crazy, the NWO has pulled a blinder on us. I have been researching earlier that Australian people don't own any of their land, I am going to keep digging - this is from the Australian central bank's website, reading between the lines - it's sinister stuff.</p>

        <p>No, it‚Äôs because you guys are a big part of why we aren‚Äôt back to normal. Your lack of regard for human life and severe absence of empathy are causing deaths just because you‚Äôre too weak to wear a bit of fabric. Of course I wish I could live like I did before.

        <p>You‚Äôre kinda right. But you also don‚Äôt really understand what you‚Äôre talking about by simplifying it down to such an argument. It‚Äôs not really about stopping individuals getting infected. It‚Äôs about minimising the total damage of the pandemic. If we all play a part in that, and do it properly (I.e. avoid most of the misinformation on this subreddit) the pandemic will be over much sooner and much less people will die. There are pretty much two ways you could disagree with that: claim that it‚Äôs all propaganda (and it‚Äôs not, the maths supports it) or complete nihilism (everyone will die eventually so why try to lower death tolls). I‚Äôve lost a few people due to this pandemic. They died because the virus was allowed to spread. They would‚Äôve lived much longer if it was contained. I‚Äôve had COVID myself because somebody in my household is a key worker. It‚Äôs not awful when you‚Äôre healthy, I personally just had bad headaches for a few days and felt very tired. But you don‚Äôt want it. And if you‚Äôre not healthy, there‚Äôs a fair chance it could kill you. Just take some perspective please. It‚Äôs not about liberty or security (which most people don‚Äôt understand anyway).</p>

        <p>Pretty poor motto. And ‚Äòsurrendered your rights‚Äô is dumb. You make it sound like you‚Äôre a slave on a plantation or something. All we‚Äôre asking is that you wear a bit of cloth and stand a bit further away from people. Also, that‚Äôs much easier to say when it‚Äôs not you dying. I can immediately assume your American by that attitude though. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong</p>

<p>That's all <em>you're</em> asking. Some people get ordered to stay at home afraid for just a little longer, just a little longer, just a little longer...</p>

        <p>Fine by me. Because I actually care about others and don‚Äôt get angry about ‚Äòmy rights‚Äô when I‚Äôm mildly inconvenienced. And once again you seemed to have missed the point that if everyone actually did as they were told, we‚Äôd already have been back to normal by Autumn 2020.</p>

        <p>You should care more about your own rights. Some of us have had our jobs and our homes taken from us by the government. But I‚Äôm glad you have been privileged enough to not have to worry about such things.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôll humour you and pretend like that‚Äôs true. But then you‚Äôre a big part of why there are children unnecessarily self-harming and committing suicide, why a staggering number of children in developing nations will unnecessarily die of hunger, why dementia deaths have skyrocketed and many elderly peoples‚Äô lives were totally insulted as they were forced to spend the last moments of them alone, why there is a backlog of legitimately serious health concerns that now may not be treated in time. The list goes on and on. Do you care? One unavoidable virus from a family of viruses that are circulating among us as we speak and have been for a long time vs a never ending list of avoidable consequences inflicted on society by those elected to serve and lead us. If you try and justify that, you are a sick individual. </p>
<p>Keep holding on to that tired and despicable narrative, see where it gets you. Sounds to me like you should grow up, or at the very least try and act like an actual human being.</p>
