        <p>Okay so someone posted this once here that they got from a lawyer who wrote it. Just change it up to make it relevant for you. I didn't write it, so don't ask me about it. I don't know if it'll work but it's better than nothing:</p>
<p>To: Edited, University President</p>
<p>Edited, Provost and Executive Vice President</p>
<p>Office of Equity</p>
<p>Demand For Cessation of Unlawful Coercion, Invasion of Privacy, and Unlicensed Medical Practice</p>
<p>Date: July  , 2021</p>
<p>Dear edited  </p>
<p>Your stated "requirement" issued on July  , 2021, that employees accept medical treatment as a condition of employment is unlawful and constitutes grounds for major remedy to employees wrongly coerced.</p>
<p>International law, Geneva conventions and the Nuremberg Codes, to which USA is a signator, prohibit coerced and forced medical treatments and any non-consensual medical treatment/s specifically including "vaccinations." This is especially true of experimental vaccines and vaccines that have not had full testing processes,have not had approval from the FDA, and have thereby not been proven safe to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Covid-19 vaccines are experimental, are untested, have not had standard FDA process of approval, and are not shown to be safe. Various other Constitutional and Statutory authorities also support public protection against non-consensual vaccination such as statutes covering assault, public endangerment, unauthorized and unlicensed administration and practice of medicine and fundamental freedoms and rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>You have failed in the requirement to show that:</p>
<p>(a) You are a licensed physician.</p>
<p>(b) I have consented to your recommended treatments.</p>
<p>(c) Your treatments are fully tested and proven safe.</p>
<p>Having so failed, your requirement that I submit to your requested medical treatments are unlawful and cause for major actions against you, your company and all complicit parties. If you have issued any “order” or “requirement” that employees be vaccinated without their express wish to be vaccinated based on their medical needs and desires, and threatened loss of job and financial hardship as a result of failure to submit to these demands, this is coercion. </p>
<p>I will allow one week from this delivery for you to provide a clear and binding statement retracting that position AND declaring that vaccines and medical treatments are not a condition of my employment with your company. </p>
<p>If, after that time I have not received that notice from you and/or an authorized party, you will be subject to major penalties and remedies and claim/s will be submitted which must be settled timely in order to avoid escalated claims.</p>
<p>Additionally, I refuse to submit medical records to you as a condition of my employment, discuss my medical treatments as decided by my physician, or submit to medical mandates and testing, including face coverings in a state where it has been declared unnecessary by the state governing authorities, as is my right as a citizen of the United States. </p>
<p>Your request forms for medical exemption imply that you have authority over my medical choices as a condition of my employment, and therefore require authorization for “exemption” of said authority.  </p>
<p>I negate your authority to make medical decisions for me, and therefore I do not require medical exemption until such a time as you can prove in a court of law that you have the authority to make medical decisions on my behalf. </p>
<p>I also refuse to submit details of my spiritual, moral, or belief systems to you as a condition of my employment, as is my right as a citizen of the United States.  Your request forms for religious exemption require me to define my spiritual beliefs and practices to you, my employer, as a condition of my employment.  I negate your right to request any information as to my belief systems.</p>
<p>It is an impingement of my rights in this country for you to refuse me employment on the basis of my medical history, my spiritual practices, or failure to provide details of either of those things.  I refute any claims or rights you believe you hold to this information and will not be submitting either to you as a condition of my employment at edited University. </p>
<p>I have the right to believe what I wish, without defining it to you, and I have the right to decline your medical advice.  </p>
<p>This is America.  We all still have rights over our own body autonomy, spiritual practices, and privacy and I find your requests for information to be a gross impingement on my constitutional rights.</p>
<p>You are in agreement with all terms and conditions herein unless you provide supported rebuttal within 30 days of this delivery. Any point herein that may be found to be in error or ineffective shall not diminish the effect of any other point herein.  A formal written copy of this notice has been mailed to your offices.</p>
<p>Sincerely, edited</p>

<p>Filtering facepiece (dust mask) means a negative pressure particulate respirator with a filter as an integral part of the facepiece or with the entire facepiece composed of the filtering medium.</p>
<p>In any workplace where respirators are necessary to protect the health of the employee or whenever respirators are required by the employer, the employer shall establish and implement a written respiratory protection program with worksite-specific procedures. </p>
<p>Medical evaluation. Using a respirator may place a physiological burden on employees that varies with the type of respirator worn, the job and workplace conditions in which the respirator is used, and the medical status of the employee. Accordingly, this paragraph specifies the minimum requirements for medical evaluation that employers must implement to determine the employee's ability to use a respirator.</p>

        <p>It’s not a HIPAA violation to ask for that information. If the employer contacted your wife’s dr without her permission and the dr gave out this info, then the dr would have committed a HIPAA violation.</p>

        <p>Kroger’s is doing that too. If you can’t prove you’re vaccinated, you’re forced to wear a mask. They said it’s a permanent rule, so if you have 20 years to go till you retire, then you’re wearing that mask for 20 years.</p>

        <p>No, I don't. Also, I don't have to wear it when I'm on my desk. Unfortunately, my warehouse colleagues must wear it all day long and it's 95F outside. Only about 30% of them took the vax despite all of this.</p>
