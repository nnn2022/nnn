    <strong>You can care about civil liberties and be kind to people who are happy to be at home.</strong>
    <p><p>This level of hostility and condescension on my previous post is why people want to stay at home. It's humiliating enough to work retail while trying to go to college/take care of parents or elderly grandparents/pay rent. I am literally trying to improve my options in life by getting a graduate degree, but every day of my working life I have been treated like a subhuman for having to work customer service. I have been hit, screamed at, had things thrown at me, sexually harassed, and done all that while taking 6 classes a semester. </p>
<p>I even say in my original post that it's not worth losing civil liberties over. I am just explaining why some people are *happy* to be at home. Who would want to go back to harassment and degradation? Obviously the government can't pay people to stay at home forever, and it's dangerous that so many civil liberties have been taken away, but some empathy for people whose lives are better off at home than at work would be nice. What does it say about American work culture and work places if people are happier at home than at work, particularly for working class/retail/entry level jobs?</p>
<p>40 years ago, you could buy a house and support a family on one income. Now, you need to work 100 hours a week just to get a one bedroom. It's stressful to work two or three jobs just to keep a roof over your head. it's stressful to be verbally abused every day. Of course people are happy to be home. They shouldn't be at home forever, but it's a serious relief for many to be at home. <br>
Why does pointing that out warrant such hostility and personal insults towards me?  </p>
<p>It's really hurtful and offensive you make it out like I am a loser with a garbage life whose life never went anywhere. I am literally a full time student. I have literally had mental breakdowns trying to pay my bills so that I can keep a roof over my head while doing what I have been told i need to do to be a valid human. </p>
<p>There are millions of people out there like me, who were just exhausted and the lockdown is a chance to catch your breath. I want to go back to work and be part of society, but the work culture of being degraded for minimum wage needs to change and these conversations need to happen.</p></p>

        <p>Why wouldn't you make this response to your original post?</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>If you want a break take a break. Your idiocy in letting the government do this is harming people who don't want to take a break. Make you feel good? Forcing us to do something we don't want to do? I'm going broke. Money I worked hard for is going down the drain on bullshit because there's nothing coming in. My retirement money is slipping way so I'll have to keep working into my '60s and '70s probably.</p>
<p>Does that make you feel good, that you're ruining other people's lives?</p>
<p>Fucking liberals. You people have literally screwed up standing in lines and walking through the grocery store.</p>

        <p>People are reacting to you with hostility because they've had their rights taken away, and we're all going to have to pay for this through higher taxes, even people like me who have worked this entire time.</p>
<p>I know from experience that working retail can be shitty, but there's no need to feel 'humiliated'. I personally felt pretty proud of myself when I was younger and juggled studying part time while working (in retail).</p>
<p>Don't take the comments so personally, and use this time while you're not working to study so you are ahead. We can all see that some people prefer to stay home, but enforcing that on others is not fair.</p>
<p>Edit: you're not a loser dude. You're right that it's hard to get on the property ladder, and anyone who works has my respect.</p>

        <p>I worked two jobs while in college, and I also had a job while doing law school full time. It was a lot of work. I would encourage you to try and work harder. A lot of my friends did not have the work ethic to succeed and now they’re broke. Having said that, if you want to stay home and take a break from life, then do so. Just know that success is earned, and taking it easy can screw up your future. Best of luck to you!</p>

        <p>I don’t think you’re lazy. I think you’re fatigued. Keep your head up and keep pushing along. I also think people were reacting to your comment about enjoying the break. Honestly, tensions are high right now and it’s easy to say insensitive shit on the internet. None of us would be talking to each other with this animosity face-to-face. I worked as a cashier at a burrito place when I was 19, and now I’m successful. Your time will come if you keep working hard at it!</p>

        <p>I say repeatedly that I want to work and participate in society and I am called lazy and a loser and that I don't have a work ethic, despite working two jobs most of my adult life and being a student most of my adult life. I am just unsure what I can even say at this point.</p>

        <p>I replied to your other comment. But I want to add that  I understand where you’re coming from. I assume you’re in your twenties or so. There was a time when I couldn’t even afford WiFi and I had to go to a local cigar bar to watch football. I’ve been there. Things got much better, but it took some time. I had to work my ass off. I know you can get there! Don’t give up :)</p>

        <p>I'm sorry that being called a loser or liberal or moocher is causing you this much distress. Making assumptions about another person based on the very limited information we have to work with here on the internet is very common. We are trying to keep this place relatively open for debate, and we must conduct ourselves with some civility. </p>
<p>Most of what I moderate here is abusive language or blatant trolling. I.e, "Fuck off you fucking shitbags I fucking hope you die of COVID and someone fucks you in the eye socket for being a selfish piece of human garbage."</p>
<p>It isn't necessarily fair that people are responding to you in this way. But there is a difference between not being fairly classified--something you may clarify, debate and defend against--and being harrassed, abused, and stalked.</p>
<p>Yours is naturally going to be an unpopular opinion in a sub of this type. There is going to be, perhaps, an overwhelming amount of disagreement. Your original post had a lot of interesting conversation in it, but it seems like you are more fixated on vindicating yourself by continuing to make threads that derail and divide the topic. </p>
<p>I suggest that when someone makes a direct, baseless insult toward you, you utilize the report button on that comment so we can evaluate it.</p>
