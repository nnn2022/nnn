    <strong>Went to a party without masks yesterday and it felt good.</strong>
    <p><p>It’s  the first time in a while I was able to truly forget about coronavirus for a few hours. I’ve been living my life but when I have to wear a mask everywhere (CA) it felt good to not have to think about it. Nobody was wearing a mask and it really made me forget about it.</p>
<p>Idk if this makes sense I’m mad tired but thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>Good for you!
There is a business near me that doesn’t require masks and has fundraisers going for the fines because of it. I try and frequent it as much as I can.
Funny thing is the people going there that I have seen are still 90% mask wearers.
Being the only person in a room not wearing one makes me self conscious but I know if I saw someone not wearing it it would be make more comfortable taking my own off.
Someone has to be the first.</p>

        <p>I hear you on that totally, about being self conscious and not being too eager about going unmasked in places. Since to me(living in a more pro-lockdown area), I'd rather first be sure that myself I won't get blowback from staff at a business, for trying to be unmasked. I'd only do it, if I was sure others didn't care about mask wearing there.</p>

        <p>I live in a small rural town of 10K people in Ontario</p>
<p>Masks have been mandatory for like 4+ months know when it first happened I complied because everyone did but now I test the waters everywhere but big grocery stores.</p>
<p>One of the things that suck about living in a small town is that everyone knows you and if you choose to make a stand at a certain place a lot of the times it's not as you can go to another business that provides that service in the area you would have to go to another town entirely.</p>
<p>That's where a lot of the power comes from its the fact that people dont want to be judged I'm sure there are many people who think like me in my town but unfortunately, there are more bootlickers that see the words mandate or "covid order" and really believe that they need to mask up to "flatten the curve"</p>
<p>I lose respect for people that give into my province's propaganda!</p>

        <p>I don't know about where you are, but in my small Ontario town the rule is that you have to wear a mask inside any building that isn't a private dwelling. So that's what I do. It goes on as I go in the door, and it comes off the moment I step out the door.</p>

        <p>Yea that's what it's like in my town.</p>
<p>Usually, that's what I do as well I have gone maskless in dollar stores and certain restaurants their is 1 that lets me in maskless for take out they have the signs on the door but the customers eating inside dont have them on,</p>
<p>I only do that at places that have indoor dining though it's kinda hard to do it at takeout only places.</p>
<p>Once I was asked if I had a mask at a restaurant picking up takeout and I said my mom was driving my car and she took it was not a lie girl said okay next time please have one I felt that was hypocritical because dine-in customers unmasked and their chef was not even wearing one but I just said okay and left!</p>
<p>the worst is the LCBO went in and got Instantly stopped and told the girl my excuse and she reluctantly got me a mask and said "so you know we dont let people in the store without them"</p>
<p>and I replied back "yea well you could choose not to enforce that"</p>
<p>and she replied back "yeah I guess I could".</p>
<p>then the girl at the cash told me "it's supposed to go over your nose" and I politely said "ok and did not bother fixing it paid and left.</p>
<p>I take it off when I get outside but the majority of people I see keep them on till they get in their cars some drive off with them on I dont understand these peoples really think these masks block more than spit semen saliva and snot!</p>
<p>I also see people wearing them outside on walks and while having conversations, I have gotten my haircut at a salon I use to like and had a crazy lady tell me how I should be wearing a mask outside and when I step out of my car like people in Fergus have to in the bylaw....</p>
<p>I live in Halton Hills and one of the exemptions is literally if it affects a person's mental health or well being I could use this as a reason not to wear a mask but I would have to explain it every store and it would be a pain and I would be heavily judged for not complying </p>

<p>I just wish businesses had the balls to start ripping the propaganda signs off their doors let me know where you stand on it before I enter so I dont make myself look like a fool walking unmasked into some Karens with smartphones</p>

        <p>Yea I try not to let it bother me,  but it's hard man good to know there are other like-minded people that are fed up with this bullshit.</p>
<p>Lately, I have been finding the best driving roads around my house I'm about 15 minutes away from the forks of the credit but cops love that place lol almost as much as I do! I drive a 6spd 03 Passat W8 not 2 fancy but it's fun car insurance is also pretty cheap because it's still a 4 door.</p>
<p>IDK if you like driving cars or have a bike but this is a cool website if you do <a href="http://bikeroads.atspace.com/roads.htm#tor">http://bikeroads.atspace.com/roads.htm#tor</a></p>
<p>Dirtbiking weather seems to be dying down people will be on snowmobiles soon</p>
<p>Dont get me a wrong-a lot of people are great here and see right through the bullshit its just people in the towns that run stores making up comply really. Even in that story at the LCBO, it was a small one I knew the people that ran it the cashier still said have a nice day after so I dont feel bad per se for telling her she could have chosen not to enforce it because it's true. I think they were shocked because I am a pretty small light and skinny guy with a pretty happy demeanor and like most people, I dont show my true opinions in public, especially in my small town.</p>
<p>I have a 70 something-year-old neighbor from Switzerland that delivers me hay and since day 1 he has not had an inkling of fear from Covid this guy is also 70 and can spear 2 round bales onto his tractor like nothing so I guess he's from a different time!</p>

        <p>Hosted a Halloween party in October that felt amazing. I think it was technically within whatever crazy rules we had in the UK at the time too (rule of 6). It felt like a little piece of normal, no masks (ha even our costumes were maskless) or social distancing, costumes, games, food, alcohol, music, happiness.<br>
I'd happily do it again and again, that's what owning your own space and making your own choices is all about.</p>

        <p>Lol I got covid at a halloween party with the same details as yours. But, I had a fever for only 2 days, and a cough for 4. I got tested because I thought for sure there was no way THIS was the plague everyone was freaking out about, but low and behold, tested positive. Otherwise, it was exactly like a cold. My SO had even fewer symptoms.</p>

        <p>I believe I caught it at a hween party too. Day after I felt a little under the weather, felt like the beginning stages of a cold. The following two days I was just incredibly groggy and stiff feeling, congested, and sneezing a lot. I haven't caughed from an illness since I caught pneumonia almost 15yrs ago. Never got tested because I didn't deem it worth my time, and a few others from the party reported feeling a bit crappy for 2-3 days. Third day all symptoms gone and back to feeling awesome again. </p>
<p>It's a 🤡 virus</p>

        <p>Awesome! A few weekends ago I went to a friends wedding. Masks required at the wedding. Reception there was not a mask in sight. 130 people enjoying themselves, drinking, dancing, celebrating without wearing crap on their face or trying to distance. It was amazing.</p>

        <p>There are some that ofc are because of covid, probably around 30% of those numbers. Plus the 2% number of deaths that increase every year in Brazil, plus the spike of deaths by drug abuse and other things, that can be traced back to hunger and poverty, which quarentines increased A LOT. Quarantine kills more in Brazil than covid ever would. The thing is, there is no such thing as 170k deaths by covid. Most people are very old and/or in very bad shape and health.</p>

        <p>I do have, and they are all the time on debate here. Who to kill? Poor people by hunger, old people by covid? I'm not a home so i'll send you a bunch later. The thing is, they arein portuguese, because it studies the effects in our country. </p>
<p>The source for the first affirmation is based upon death rate by age. When you die of covid at age 80+, you died of old age, because any other sickness would've kille you just the same. There are hundreds of other diseases far more lethal in % of the infected, the only difference being covid spreads easier. But death did not spike in Brazil. And sry but english is not my first language so arguments are hard</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right! Quarantines are hurting so many people, and people mostly die with covid, not of it. Actually covid deaths are recorded within 28 days of a positive test. It's crazy!</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same. It is mentally draining to go out into public and see only automatons following what their television told them. </p>
<p>For me the place where I go every week as a safe haven from the new abnormal is the local church. It has been wonderful, the people do not give a flying damn about the lies that are being told to the public... there is not a mask to be seen in there. </p>
<p>If you guys are feeling atomized and need people who are not following commands from big brother, check out your local churches... I am not saying go and convert and be christian, but here where I am the people there are in mass ignoring the new normal. </p>
<p>Go shake some hands, go say good morning and smile at people. Go be normal.</p>

No masks, no distancing, everyone hugs and sits together and pretends everything normal because it is. There’s no way I’m letting an overblown reactionary response to the flu prohibit me from spending time with the people I care about. We all park a street over and haven’t been caught yet lol.</p>
