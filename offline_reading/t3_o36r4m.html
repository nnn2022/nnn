    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 28/x: Hamburg cancels a scientifically supported model test marathon with a strict hygiene concept because the incidence is TOO LOW. At the same time, it forbids the SAME marathon without a concept, as the rules do not allow that.</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;After months of exchanges with the authorities, offices and independent security experts, a 70-page infection protection and hygiene concept was submitted around 6 weeks ago - supplemented by an application for the event to be carried out as a model test. Model tests aim to obtain scientific knowledge within the framework of the implementation of events suitable for pandemics with the help of a suitable study design.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;During the development of this concept, we were supported by one of the leading German safety experts and a team of experts from the Manchester Metropolitan University, which enjoys a high worldwide reputation in the field of “crowd safety and risk analysis”. The same team is currently working with the London Marathon and New York City Marathon, among others, to rehearse the emergency for ten times as many participants.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The concept took into account the current developments in pandemic control as well as extensive data collection for scientific monitoring. Movements on the site should be tracked with the help of the sent start numbers with integrated timing chip, while the tried and tested hygiene protocols of our events that have already been implemented during the pandemic were maximized and optimized. This included, among other things, the complete closure of the Elbe island Kaltehofe for the duration of the event, which should only be opened for participants and crew.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to the authorities, the rejection was due to the reduced relevance of the model test - the incidence values ​​are too low and the outdoor setup is not suitable for achieving scientific benefit. However, a release without a model test is not compatible with the current containment ordinance.</p>

<p>Always remember: This is just a test to see how stupid people are. How much shit they eat before they start to wake up and to protest. Hint: There are no protests in Germany.</p>
