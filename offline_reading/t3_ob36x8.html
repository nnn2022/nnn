    <strong>A more optimistic approach for the Winter months</strong>
    <p><p>Of course, this can go either way, for better or for worse, regarding the fearmongering for 2021's Winter when Flu season comes around, but I have a feeling that perhaps lockdowns might not return for a long time (at least in the USA), because <strong>that would be political suicide for which ever politician tries to implement it again.</strong> The elephants in the room have gotten way too big to ignore, such as the opened states not collapsing into "impending doom" as the CDC previously were worried about.</p>
<p>Now, does that mean lockdowns are forever gone? Hell no, I absolutely doubt that. They have now set a precedent for lockdowns which they have attempted to normalize, but perhaps it might not come back as early as this winter as some of us previous theorized.</p>
<p>What's everyone's take on the next few months?</p></p>

        <p>I think the cyber pandemic will be next so maybe not physical lockdowns but internet lockdowns will prevent us from normal life anyway</p>

        <p>yeah, this is what I'm on the look for, the so called Dark Winter.</p>
<p>I'm a bit skeptic about having a global blackout or the total end of the internet a some say but, always good to have an eye on it.</p>

        <p>It really doesnt matter, because the elections are most likely rigged anyway. There are people in power that cant have that much real votes behind them.</p>

        <p>Antibody dependent enhancement is going to kick-in fully beginning in late fall and winter. The media is going to call it a new strain and blame the unvaccinated, but it's going to coincidentally harm vaccinated people at a much higher rate. </p>
<p>We're already seeing vaccinated people fall seriously ill from basic viruses, like when Israel had a huge issue with the common cold after they vaccinated a serious amount of their population. It's too warm to see any widespread issues right now in the US and Europe, but it's going to be a "dark winter" for the vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Will we see lockdowns? Who knows. But we will see a relentless attack on the unvaccinated, even if basic virus evolution disproves the theory of stronger strains developing from the unvaccinated. Flu shots and probably a rushed booster will be pushed on the vaccinated, only further weakening their beaten-down immune systems from the original vaccine.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m worried that this vaccine rollout was done during the warmer months to create the illusion that these vaccines are super effective, but once respiratory diseases ramp up in the winter like always, the vaccine may actually enhance the usual sickness we see in the winter. And that will be blamed on the unvaccinated.</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>"climate lockdown" starting 2022 or 2023</p>
