    <strong>Help writing speech: why vaccine passports are a terrible idea</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm helping a student in their last year of high school write a speech for English. I live in Victoria, so they lost almost a full year of schooling (and another week just now... It never ends). The information I share with them about the insanity of lockdowns and everything else has resonated with them enough that they've chosen to do their final oral presentation on this topic.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a huge variety of different things we could focus on for the speech, from the unscientific nature of lockdowns, the complete disregard for all other aspects of public health and civil existence, censorship of dissenting experts, coersion of experimental and unnecessary injections, defamation of cheap and effective treatments, the redefinition of cases, gross over counting of deaths, use of media to constantly push fear etc., etc.</p>
<p>But while we can touch briefly on all of those, I feel like the more pressing issue is the impending vaccine passport and how this will inevitably create a two-tier society.</p>
<p>I'm calling on you to please contribute with your well-reasoned thoughts and opinions about this and why it should never be implemented/any other inputs/any links to good sources regarding this issue. Thanks so much in advance.</p></p>

        <p>One thing you can look at is this punishes those who cannot receive the vaccine</p>
<p>I had COVID almost a year ago. The US FDA has an emergency use authorization for COVID Antibody Plasma Therapy.</p>
<p>I donate blood and blood platelets for this. It's is used to treat those who can't get a vaccine. Advanced stage cancer patients, some organ transplant patients, those who have had vaccine injuries, those suspectable to anaphylaxis, and those who are immunocompromised.</p>
<p>Vax passports makes these people 2nd class citizens.</p>
<p>It also sets a terrible precedent that Big Pharma and the Government can force citizens to partake in vaccines that are not even passed clinical trials, or become 2nd class citizens.</p>
<p>You can also flip the script and out liberal them. People of color are hesitant and distrustful regarding the medical industry and government due to prior medical experimentation and forced sterilization. The US this century and up until the 70s purposely gave black people syphilis without their knowledge in order to study them. One of our immigration facilities   up until this year were performing unnecessary hysterectomies. Canada has a dark past with medical experiments on First Nation peoples. There are dozens in not over a hundred examples of this Requiring vaccine passports is insensitive to these tragedies and the mistrust that rightly exists and thus is racist.</p>
<p>Good luck, if you need more 8deas or want to bounce something off me let me know</p>

        <p>Ignoring natural immunity is anti-science.
Coercing people into participating in a medical trial violates the Nuremberg code.
Compliance with this style of government encourages it in the future.
Let these politicians fail. I treat the vaccine like a vote.</p>
<p>The vaccine passport opens the door to a much worse country. We shouldn’t be forced to play Russian roulette to participate in society.</p>

        <p>The best thing to do is to spin the tables on them regarding the vax pass.</p>
<p>Say that you are happy that society will be segregated because vaccinated people make you biologically nervous due to potential shedding and you find them generally untrustworthy when it comes to important decision making. You feel liberated by the notion that the government is willing to protect you from these people by separating them out of society into the jobs, stores and communities that find the high level of risk of associating with vaccinated people to be tolerable. You are thankful that the government is taking these steps to warn and isolate the robustly healthy unvaccinated from the doomed individuals who have chosen to sacrifice their health for a clinical trial.</p>
<p>And on and on with the 180. Paint it all positive. Don't fight it. Instead, stigmatize the vaxxed!</p>
