        <p>What's funny is their response to this would most likely be "it's to save lives and keep you safe" but that's precisely what abusers tell their victims to justify their behavior " this is for your own good" or " I only do this to you because I love and care for you so much" it's amazing that these people can't see the parallel.</p>

        <p>You nailed it. I told a fake story to my family members in their 50s and 60s about a “friend” who did this and their reactions were all the same. “Omg that’s evil, call the police! Get a lawyer!”</p>
<p>My response “who do you call when you’re own government does this to it’s people? How long have you all been abused by your government?”</p>
<p>You can see the lights come on in their eyes.</p>

        <p>Except the difference is that, in this case, it <em>actually</em> is for your own good and the safety of others. In instances of abuse, there is no real risk or legitimate reason, and the abuser is simply doing it to control the victim.</p>

        <p>I mean you can make yourself believe anything if you choose to reject objective reality. Obviously I'm not going to convince you that the risk of covid is real. I'm just pointing out the difference in your analogy.</p>
<p>In the case of the controlling husband, these restrictions are designed to control the woman's autonomy and sexuality, when there is no legitimate risk to seeing people and going out uncovered.</p>
<p>In the case of the covid guidelines, the restrictions are designed to protect people from spreading a deadly infectious disease, and there is a chance you will get sick or make others sick if you see people and go out uncovered...</p>
<p>Unless of course, you buy into the conspiracy that it's all some world wide secret government rude being used to subjugate and control the population with... <em>checks notes</em> fabric masks?</p>

<p>Lol, society isn't being destroyed, it's a set of temporary limitations. This is like a teen girl being told by her parents  she can't go out to a movie with her friends and going "YoU'Re RuInInG mY LiFe!!!"</p>
<p>The limitations will pass, less people will have died because of them, and society will remain intact.</p>

        <p>Why the fuck would there be a set date for a pandemic being over? Are you actually serious with this shit? What are we just gonna call covid and ask it "hey, do you think you could stop infecting people by about, oh, idk, the second week of April?"</p>
<p>We fight it until it's no longer a threat. Have some patience, ffs. </p>
<p>Man I'm so glad that we're not dealing with something even deadlier and more infectious, we'd be so fucked because of people like you. For your sake and mine, I hope we can get covid19 under control before it mutates into something even worse, and people like you no longer have the luxury of sticking your fingers in your ears and screaming "I don't believe in you, covid"</p>

        <p>Didn't say "set date for ending the pandemic," so nice job on the goalpost shift.</p>
<p>We restricted for a reason. The reason they gave us was to slow the inevitable flow of patients through our hospitals. They told us that it made more sense to draw out the term of the emergency if it kept hospitals from being overrun.</p>
<p>Then they did their own song-and-dance when it was obvious we weren't going to overrun our hospitals. Now, we needed to "stop the spread." When that proved ineffective, they re-branded it to "slow the spread."</p>
<p>Over and over, they restrict without respect to the secondary effects. Keep kids out of school, even though that age group is largely unscathed by any coronavirus, let alone this particular one. Close gyms, even though healthy and fit people are largely unscathed by this as well. Close bars, restaurants and meeting places, even though doing so encourages people to gather in private homes where there are no safety precautions. Assign curfews, which force the public to do their private business at the same time in more crowded conditions. Close "non-essential" retail businesses, which force everyone to do business in the same half-dozen places, also generating more crowds.</p>
<p>If we were dealing with something more deadly, we wouldn't have any of these restrictions. Do you know why? Because people are capable of protecting themselves. During ice storms, people don't run out to the mall to shop. During hurricanes, folks don't gather for family reunions. And in the middle of flu season, the vulnerable stay out of crowds.</p>
<p>Take whatever precautions you need to take. But don't presume that everyone else concern themselves with your problems, when their own problems are much more important to them.</p>

        <p>&rt;Results obtained in the study show that common fabric materials may provide marginal protection against nanoparticles including those in the size ranges of virus-containing particles in exhaled breath.</p>
<p>Way to prove the point that it's better to wear them than to not wear them at all. We need every edge that we can get. If I can wear a mask and save just ONE life, you're goddamn right I'm gonna wear it.</p>
<p>It's unbelievable how willing you're so willing to steel your beliefs about some governmental boogeymen controlling your lives with masks, that you refuse to acknowledge the context of when this video was made. This was during a time when even medical workers were experiencing an extreme shortage of masks, and the virus hadn't so deeply infected our nation. Notice how at the end of the clip he even says that people who are ill should wear the mask.</p>
<p>The thing with covid is that you can be host to the virus without experiencing any symptoms at all, but still be spreading it to others unknowingly. This is why wearing them is recommended for everyone. There is no longer a shortage, and since we can't always know who is spreading the disease, our safest bet is to have everyone wear masks just in case.</p>

        <p>No one in this forum is ill. People stay home when they're sick. PCR is being used to manufacture the lie that people are sick when they are not so people who "Listen and Believe" can do exactly as you are ultimately creating more dependent people as the economy becomes 100% government dependent.</p>
<p>It's people like you who would rather look at words given by "trusted" authority figures rather than look at results and make a choice independent from those authorities you think care about us so much.</p>

<p>Listen and Believe.</p>
<p>Hey, you do you. At the end of the day, we all make our own individual health choices. You want to listen and believe? Be my guest. I've given you a study on cloth masks being ineffective against particulate the size of aerosolized virus, and you given me rhetoric that might be useful if we normally went around spitting on each other like it's a part normal human socializing.</p>
<p>You don't get to have autonomy over my health or my health choices.  I'll continue to be healthy and interact with the world without these farcical impediments as I have for the last year without any fear of sickness.</p>

        <p>Actually, I didn't give you evidence on PCR - different comment on a separate debate. Here ya go:</p>
<p><strong>Reuters Fact Check Team</strong> <a href="https://www.eclassifie.com/2020/05/what-is-a-pcr-test-kit-by-kary-mullis/">on Kary Mullis's statements discounting PCR process for diagnostics</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;Misleading. The quote regarding the limitations of PCR tests <strong>appears</strong> not to be directly from Mullis, but in any case is not evidence the test is fraudulent. PCR tests are being used widely in England to show that SARS-CoV-2 viral genetic material is present in the patient.</p>
<p><strong>Kary Mullis HIMSELF</strong> (inventor of PCR) on PCR: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-83tSpq0e0">"with PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody”</a> (2 mins)</p>
<p>How about you think about why you are willing to automatically defer to so-called authoritative mouth-pieces? That might involve rethinking your entire ideology though, so I doubt that's going to happen.</p>

        <p>Let's put it another way.</p>
<p>You get home from school one day and your parents tell you that you're grounded. Yep, you know why: you failed two tests this week and got detention yesterday. What's the first question you ask?</p>
<p>"How long am I under restriction?"</p>
<p>They tell you, "Until we see a change in you."</p>
<p>What changes do they want to see? They can't tell you. How do you know what you're supposed to do? They can't tell you that either. But they tell you that they'll know when they see the change, so you need to start working on it.</p>
<p>Sure, parents don't want to set a simple two-week restriction when there are no guarantees of the child using the time for the improvement they want to see. But a kid who sees no end and no clear path to get there will simply bide his time. Eventually, when there is no leadership (clear instructions and guidelines), he will rebel.</p>
<p>The best restrictions have conditions. "We're shutting down schools for a month. Teachers and administrators can use the time to plan how they will proceed." "We're stopping all in-person sporting events and gatherings for a month. Afterward, we'll have guidelines for those who want to gather."</p>

        <p>But there actually are legitimate risks every day, even without COVID, and some abusers use them as justification to control their victims. For instance, an abusive father will say his young adult daughter has to stay in at night or she could get grabbed by a creepy man in the street.</p>

        <p>And thus we all suffer from Stockholm syndrome and worse - when we’re not aware of what’s really going on we try and protect our abuser and normalize the abuse of others to help our own abuse feel “ normal” it’s a survival defense mechanism of abusers. This is part of why so many who are a plugged in are so horrible to others and yelling at them to “ just wear the mask”. It makes their abuse palatable. Misery doesn’t love company. It needs company t survive.</p>

        <p>Science isn’t settled. There are equally a number of case studies that show masks do nothing. </p>
<p>But I’m not gonna argue with you. Your goal is to convince me that you’re right. That will never happen because I don’t believe you. You’re not capable of seeing anything beyond what you believe. And that’s fine.</p>

        <p>That study is outdated and that clip is was way out of context, how is it a detriment to you to wear a mask then? Would you rather let you loved ones die for no reason? Because I wouldn't.</p>

        <p>Yes. I would rather myself and my love ones die free people than submit to completely anti-rational authoritarian decrees. We choose freedom over tyranny.</p>
<p>If you believe 2 or 3-layered masks protect you, good, keep wearing them. I will assume responsibility for my own health risk by not wearing one, same as they will assume responsibility for theirs by either choosing to or not to.</p>

        <p>So you are the most selfish and dense person that you would sacrifice your loved ones just to be "free" of wearing a cloth on your face while you buy groceries. </p>
