    <strong>I’m afraid the USA is going to take a dark turn due to the COVID response.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve posted here before on another account, but I got banned from so many subreddits I decided to just start over with a new account.</p>
<p>I’m 20 years old and I was born in Germany. My dad was in the US Air Force and stationed in Germany. He met my mom, then they had me and my two siblings. We left Germany when I was ten and went to California. German was my first language but I stopped speaking it early on in my life so I’ve almost completely forgotten it. Most people when they meet me think I’m straight up German because of my accent. Anyways, I bring that up because I lived in Europe. I’m afraid of the USA turning into Europe. I think that Joe Biden is going to win this election and I do not want that to happen. I think he’s going to win because people don’t think they can count on Trump to solve the COVID issue. </p>
<p>There are so many things wrong with Europe. They have many things there that democrats want. I’m afraid that people will turn to Biden and he will point us in the direction of Europe. I’m most afraid of tons of migrants coming in. </p>
<p>I’ve distanced myself as much as I can from there. I married an American man and we moved from California to Wyoming. He’s older, he’s 27 and we plan on having a baby soon. I wouldn’t have children in Europe because it’s too dangerous. I’m having a baby here because I know my child will be safe. I don’t want the US to become more like Europe.</p></p>

        <p>Trump will have an electoral college landslide victory on Nov 3rd but it will not be accepted by half the country. The rioting and near civil war that follows will determine the future of the United States. I am preparing and am very concerned.</p>

        <p>Do not have anything of value on public display, board up windows etc to prevent taking as much damage as possible from rioting criminals.</p>
<p>Having a shotgun handy (for criminals who just don't get it) to shot them in face first moment they start to climb in is a bonus.</p>

        <p>I have a hard time believing this won't happen. I've seen probably 2,000 trump signs and literally two biden sign, granted I obviously live in a conservative area. However, I expected Hillary to win. This time I think there will be a lot of people who switch parties, both directions, but more to the right. </p>
<p>But yes, if he wins the liberals will burn down their own cities and then wonder why it sucks there after. Like, maybe it's because all the small business owners left and the only place to work is Amazon or Dollar General, plus you were too scared to go to the theater, museum, concert hall, and park for two years, so the the owners sold the properties to foreign investors who then turned them into overpriced condos, cell tower sites, and mask factories. I voted for Bernie btw (last election).</p>

        <p>I voted for Bernie and am still politically far left of him. I'd say I'm a libertarian socialist. These lockdowns have done nothing but strip power away from the working class and transfer it directly to corporate and government elites, and further atomize our society to the point that a mental health crisis is in full swing. Humans are meant to be social, not "socially distanced." Its the way we evolved. Imo, the primary difference between a right wing libertarian and a left wing libertarian is that right wing libertarians don't seem to mind infringement of their rights as long as it's done by a corporation. I don't want the government OR corporations infringing on my human rights. Fuck these lockdowns. </p>
<p>Another crazy thing to me is that a lot of people who were formally for more open borders and freedom of movement have suddenly become xenophobic isolationists clambering to shut down borders. I swear a lot of so-called leftists would give Trump the money for the wall now if they thought it would make them safer from the virus. A lot of the left in this country has abandoned the principles of leftism. It's not the same everywhere though, in some countries the political polarization when it comes to lockdowns is actually reversed somewhat.</p>

        <p>&rt;Lockdowns are an overstep unless your area is overwhelmingly high in cases </p>
<p>&rt;reduced capacity makes sense when they are hot spots for spread like bars, but where I live, if they have out side seating then there’s no reduction of capacity just masking until food comes. Which I personally support</p>
<p>&rt;the targeted closures of places like that one gym in New Jersey is dystopian. If you take appropriate action then obviously you shouldn’t be shut down.</p>
<p>&rt;social distancing generally is a good thing. Just keep a further distance from strangers. You can’t get sick if you never breath in the virus(which is why people are so concerned with others wearing their masks too. To stop them from spewing germs at them)</p>
<p>&rt;&rt; there are certain things that went to far but so little was known at the beginning of the lock down. I definitely wouldn’t be happy living in Cali or New York right now though</p>

        <p>I think that the real president who will stay president knows this and is well prepared for it with whole military and national guard prepared for deployment first second the libtard terrorist organized riots start.</p>
<p>Only this time it will go down fast, without listening to any pathetic libtard excuses, locking up all domestic terrorists on day one and keeping them locked up until their terrorist "movement" ceases to exist permanently.</p>
<p>Eventually they'll run out of idiots and the libtard problem will be solved, no worries for normal people, military will protect you from communists.</p>

        <p>Freedom will always be a generation or an election away from becoming Tyranny.  Even if trump wins, the fight for freedom will never be over.  Just keep fighting and when you have no more fight left in you, fight some more.  Have your beautiful babies and raise them to fight for freedom.</p>
<p>Tyranny can never last.  The third reich was the 1000 year regime that lasted only 13.  The ussr took 80 some odd years.  Europe is slowly adopting more free market policies.  Even though there are fewer of us, we will win if we just outlast them.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day it is at the federal level. It gets a little murky in its authority vs state constitutions though. It's supposed to trump them but it gets into messy arguments about interpretations and such. Plus it's generally viewed in the Republican party as a negative for the federal government to mingle in state affairs more than necessary, for better or worse. Probably for worse since the Democrats don't hold themselves to the same unwritten rule.</p>

        <p>I thought most people wouldn't be wearing masks in Alaska, yet here we are. There will usually be a couple people besides myself not wearing them in the store, but everyone else will have them on - even if the store doesn't require it. I went to get tires the other day, and none of the employees were wearing masks, yet every almost every single customer wore a mask. One guy even apologized to the tire guy when he pulled his mask down to talk, because apparently he had left this better mask at home.</p>
<p>Now, when you get to restaurants in Alaska, there are more people who don't wear masks, but there are still a lot of people who do. Recently, I was at a restaurant with no mask mandate, and a family with a bunch of little kids shows up at the front door. They spend ten minutes putting on masks, march through the restaurant to their table, and then take them off again. So much work for no reason. </p>
<p>It's like people read about restrictions on the internet and began enforcing those rules on themselves, in a place where it's not required (Anchorage requires a lot of bs, but I don't live in Anchorage). </p>
<p>Anyways, Alaska is surprisingly pro-mask and pro-lockdown. Our economy is also in the shitter. Luckily, you can get away to the woods and away from the stupidity.</p>

        <p>I dont mind people choosing to wear a mask if they decide it's right for them, more power to em. Individuals can do whatever the fuck they want so long as they leave everyone else alone, I carry a gun, it's my business and I'm not screaming at everyone who chose not to carry. It's nice to hear that a lot of employees said fuck it and didn't wear em, it's their choice.</p>

        <p>The problem with the masks, is that oftentimes, it really isn't a choice. I've been turned away from some businesses for not wearing a mask (local restaurants, bookstores). I can't change my phone plan, go to the doctor, or the DMV, etc. without a mask. A lot of people are wearing them, even when it's not required, because they don't want to get in trouble or have someone give them a dirty look. Then, there are the people who think everybody should be wearing them, and try to get businesses and government to put in mask mandates. When the big chain stores began requiring them and giving out free masks, it definitely became more common where I live - probably from 50% mask wearing to 95% mask wearing. </p>
<p>I don't scream at people for wearing masks, but I have been yelled at for not wearing one. Constantly feeling like I might get into a confrontation when I go shopping because I'm not wearing one, is not something I enjoy. The longer people wear masks, the more normal this will become. So, as much as I believe in freedom of choice, there is something deeply insidious about masks.</p>

        <p>Yeah, his take doesn't make any sense. Hell, a large part of the reason I'm so anti-lockdown is because of the border closures and extreme limits to people's freedom of movement, something I regard as something that should be a human right. Wouldn't someone who opposes immigration and freedom of movement be pro-lockdown? I have no idea in hell how lockdowns have been polarized this way, I would have thought that the "left" in this country would be the ones against this kind of thing before this started. I feel like the world has gone entirely stark raving mad, and as someone who is still a libertarian leftist with actual principles like being opposed to government and corporate control, supporting freedom of association and more open borders, I feel like I don't have a side anymore. I'm staunchly opposed to capitalism and I fucking despise racists, but a lot of other people who agree with me there want us to be locked down forever.</p>

        <p>Sweden’s reported rape rate has gone up since all the migrants arrived. That’s just reported rape, it’s well known that not a lot of women report their rapes. I’m not a white supremacist, either. I’m married to a half-black and half-white guy. I literally don’t care what race the people flooding into Europe are. Notice how I said “migrants.” That’s because I don’t care what race they are, if you’re causing that many issues, you need to be removed.</p>

        <p>You were talking about Germany, not Sweden.  But correlation does not equal causation. The definition of rape in Sweden is extremely liberal and a lot of so called rapes would not be classified as rapes in other countries, for instance having consensual sex with someone without a condom on when your partner thinks you are wearing one is a rape in Sweden - this is the crime Julian Assange is accused of.  In 2018, they introduced a law criminalising non-consensual sex even when no force, violence or coercion were used, this is very different to other countries including the USA and may explain why reported incidences of rape have increased.  It should also be noted that whilst more rapes have been reported, the incidence of rape convictions has remained the same since 2005.  Even with that definition, the rate of rape in Sweden is not much higher than the US.  But you were talking about Germany:</p>
<p>Rapes per 100k population:</p>
<p>Wyoming - 42
USA - 44
Sweden - 64
Germany - 9</p>
<p>So you are 5x more likely to be raped in the USA than Germany, and as explained, Sweden's rate is higher due to its Liberal definition so can't really be directly compared. Now let's look at homicide:</p>
<p>Homicides per 100k</p>
<p>Sweden - 1
Germany - 1
USA - 5
Chicago - 24
Baltimore - 55</p>
<p>As you can see, Europe would need to get ALOT worse to get anywhere near the crime levels of an average US city, and for the country as a whole the rate is 5x higher in the USA, with Wyoming sitting at the national average of 5.  If we looked at more petty crimes like assault, burglary etc. the disparity would get even bigger.</p>

        <p>So what is the overall incidence of rape in Germany vs the USA, and are rapes defined in the same way? I'll tell you, it is around 9 per 100,000, and in the USA it is about 44 per 100,000. You are around 5x more likely to be raped in the US than you are in Germany.  You are thousands of times more likely to be murdered in Chicago than almost any city in Europe.</p>

<p>They'd have their excuse to implement an EU army, suck what little money they have away from their precious social programs and see a collapse of the Union. That's assuming Angela Merkel didn't manage to take direct control of said army and use it against dissenters who wanted to pull out like the UK.</p>
<p>Plenty of articles and reports have speculated these exact scenarios. The EU is very shaky and a US withdrawal could very well be the tipping point.</p>

        <p>Forever wars which I fought in. I don't agree with them, neither do a lot of Americans, and I for one am very happy with the peace deals being negotiated by Trump and his withdrawal strategy. Too many in power for a long time are fighting every inch of progress away from forever wars. It takes time, but its trending in that direction.</p>

        <p>Why wouldn't I be happy? Are they bad deals?  Why wouldn't we attempt to de-escalate a conflict by negotiation with the enemy? Not everyone needs to be crushed out right. That's how you end up in these never ending wars.</p>
<p>I was referring more to the Israel and the Balkans anyways.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why wouldn't we attempt to de-escalate a conflict by negotiation with the enemy?</p>
<p>Because you don't negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p>Or at least, that was what Americans used to think. That's what Hillary Clinton said. I guess Trump feels differently.</p>
<p>Like I'm supposed to hate Obama for being a Muslim sympathizer and his Iran deal, when Trump's trying to give money to the Taliban on the anniversary of 9/11?</p>

        <p>Hillary of Benghazi fame, right.</p>
<p>Not negotiating with terrorist applies to when they are actually terrorizing you. When they hold hostages, when they threaten actions against us, etc. As the conflict is now is no different than the Vietcong. They may be a terrorist organization, but they are not terrorizing us, we're in a land control conflict.</p>
<p>Again, I was and am, mostly referring to the other deals he has made. Even assuming the Taliban dealings are bad, that's one against many good deals. I'm sorry, but in politics, 1 bad deal and 10 good deals is a net positive. You can be critical of the one bad deal, but don't pretend that all his deals are bad because of the one you don't like.</p>
