    <strong>The hypocrisy of treating covid with lockdowns and a race for a vaccine instead of fixing systems.</strong>
    <p><p>So I had this interesting discussion the other day with a semi-skeptic. They kept insisting that if we don't keep numbers low, then the hospitals will overflow. I admit it's a very real concern in my country.</p>
<p>Hospitals overflowing is the second biggest covid concern, in part because overpopulation will also cause more spread of the infection. But overpopulation in hospitals has been an issue everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>So I started thinking, why are hospitals often verging on being full-up? Well I know 2 main reasons.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Social cases. At least this is what we call them in my country. People, especially elderly, who came in for some reason or another, and can't be sent home because they have no home to go to or there's no one that can look after them.</li>
<li>People using the emergency for non-emergency reasons. I don't know about other countries, but in my country people routinely went to the emergency department for non-emergency reasons. This ranged from 'not feeling well' to a child simply having a fever, to a bad cut that certainly won't kill the person. The hospital always advised people to go to public clinics for these issues, but some people still didn't listen.</li>
<li>I don't know much about this, but I'm now also questioning some things that are inherently part of the hospital system. Why are relatively healthy people, or people who have no difficulty walking at least, sent to do blood tests in a hospital? Or at least that's how it is in my area unless you go private.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I was discussing these things with this semi-skeptic but still not quite there yet person. I kept wondering why governments weren't taking covid as an opportunity to strengthen the social welfare system or split up non-essential medical services so that there will be less overcrowding in hospitals.</p>
<p>He kept arguing 'you can't change things from today till tomorrow. You can't change a system that quickly'. But apparently countries can get the manpower and money to get a covid vaccine out by November, build pre-fabricated hospitals and buy endless covid test kits.</p></p>

        <p>People go to emergency because of a mild headache that they fear may be something serious because of decads of health fearmongering. Now multiply that with months of incessant covid fear mongering and a sneeze will make them rush to hospital, so hospitals will mostly deal with hypochondria.</p>

        <p>Seriously. We've had six months of this "flatten the curve/slow the spread" bullshit. Ample time for hospitals to build more capacity so we don't have to worry about overwhelming them, which was the original justification for lockdowns and the only one that ever made even a tiny bit of sense.</p>

        <p>Well yeah, theyâ€™re the last resort of the unprepared. Who wants to risk getting their funding pulled like the WHO?</p>
