    <p><p>I'm going to co-op one of the liberals' favorite musicals and start singing or playing this on repeat to anyone telling me to mask up or lockdown. F*ck this shit. I'm standing with the people of France.</p>

<p>Do you hear the people sing? </p>
<p>Singing a song of angry men? </p>
<p>It is the music of a people </p>
<p>Who will not be slaves again!  </p>
<p>When the beating of your heart </p>
<p>Echoes the beating of the drums </p>
<p>There is a life about to start </p>
<p>When tomorrow comes!  </p>
<p>Will you join in our crusade? </p>
<p>Who will be strong and stand with me? </p>
<p>Beyond the barricade </p>
<p>Is there a world you long to see? </p>

<p>Will you give all you can give </p>
<p>So that our banner may advance </p>

<p>[Epilogue] </p>
<p>Do you hear the people sing </p>
<p>Lost in the valley of the night </p>
<p>It is the music of a people </p>
<p>Who are climbing to the light  </p>
<p>For the wretched of the earth </p>
<p>There is a flame that never dies </p>
<p>Even the darkest night will end </p>
<p>And the sun will rise.  </p>
<p>They will live again in freedom </p>
<p>In the garden of the Lord </p>
<p>They will walk behind the plough-share </p>
<p>They will put away the sword </p>
<p>The chain will be broken </p>
<p>And all men will have their reward!  </p>
<p>Will you join in our crusade? </p>
<p>Who will be strong and stand with me? </p>
<p>Somewhere beyond the barricade </p>
<p>Is there a world you long to see?  </p>
<p>Do you hear the people sing </p>
<p>Say, do you hear the distant drums? </p>
<p>It is the future that they bring </p>
<p>When tomorrow comes!  </p>
