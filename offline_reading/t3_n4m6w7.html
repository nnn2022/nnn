    <strong>What do you think is the ultimate smoking gun for the plandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>For me, if I had to pick, it's the whole HCQ situation.</p>
<p>So let's sum it up. HCQ has been in use since 1955 and can be sold over the counter in many countries. Sort of like Tylenol.</p>
<p>Comes 2020. A handful of doctors around the world start treating their patients (successfully) with HCQ, then are told to stop it. The drug is shortly after banned in many countries all over the world and described as <em>dangerous</em>.</p>
<p>In many places, doctors are literally FORBIDDEN to prescribe HCQ for COVID.</p>
<p>I recently read that in Holland, doctors who prescribe HCQ or Ivermectin to treat COVID expose themselves to a fine of 150 000€.</p>
<p>If that isn't a confession, I don't know what is.</p></p>

        <p>The number of cycles on the PCR test.</p>
<p>The very very first thing any health agency should have done is establish testing protocol. The CDC and WHO didn't put out guidance on the PCR cycle thresholds until January 2021, when they said that labs should be using a CT of 25, compared to the 40 labs were using before. Any undergraduate lab assistant can tell you why that's fucked up - the chance of false positive goes up exponentially with each thermocycle.</p>
<p>Such a blatant failure points to them being malicious, stupid, or too bureaucratic to be effective.</p>
<p>Here's the New Work Times saying 40-90% of positive PCR tests in 2020 should not have been counted as such. https://archive.is/VIFhL</p>

        <p>Yeah, PCR is a huge part of the ruse. The high cycles are a big part of it but also Christian Drosten developed the widely used faulty “Covid” PCR test protocol “without having virus material available” and relying on Chinese scientists’ genetic code published on the internet. Only used 2 of 3 primers too.
https://uncoverdc.com/2020/12/03/ten-fatal-errors-scientists-attack-paper-that-established-global-pcr-driven-lockdown</p>
<p>“Interestingly, even the hyper-orthodox German Virus-Czar and main government adviser on lockdowns and other measures, <strong>Christian Drosten, has contradicted himself on the reliability of PCR testing.</strong> In a 2014 interview regarding PCR testing for so-called MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia he said:</p>
<p>The [PCR] method is so sensitive that it can detect a single hereditary molecule of the virus. For example, if such a pathogen just happens to flutter across a nurse’s nasal membrane for a day without her getting sick or noticing anything, then she is suddenly a case of MERS. Where fatalities were previously reported, now mild cases and people who are actually in perfect health are suddenly included in the reporting statistics. This could also explain the explosion in the number of cases in Saudi Arabia. What’s more, the local media boiled the matter up to unbelievable levels.”</p>

<p>And Fauci himself has said <em>"the chances of it being replication-competent are miniscule"</em> for anything over 35. While 36 he said is <em>"just dead nucleotides. Period."</em></p>

        <p>For me the smoking gun is the fact that the man who invented the PCR test did an interview over 20 years ago saying that it doesn't prove someone has a disease, and in the same interview completely called out Dr. Fauci as a know-nothing bureaucrat who shouldn't be in charge of public policy because he doesn't understand the science.</p>

        <p>He'd have been blacklisted immediately, I'll guarantee he was already on the list when they were planning this whole thing even if he did die of natural causes. He would still be talking I'm sure but perhaps not, he was a much more private person than the media whore Fauci. No TV show would ever put Mullis on, they didn't when he spoke up about the HIV "pandemic".</p>

        <p>The smoking gun, to me, is the political movement it all came about during.  There literally was no way that Trump would not be re-elected, unless the economy was thrown into shambles.  It still was not a certainty, as the economy bounced quickly back, as restrictions started to be lifted, globally.  </p>
<p>The argument that “other nations did had the same restrictions!” has no validation either.  Trump was in the nationalist category, and many of our supposed “allies” didn’t care for him either.  Especially places like China.</p>
<p>When the worm had turned after a few months, more issues had to be created, such as social justice, which served to divide America more.</p>
<p>Last thing about this: when it’s brought up that this was largely a politically motivated movement, the amount of resistance you will get is profound.  Even outrage by Trump detractors.  That means, to me, my presumption is correct.  This group will deny, deny, deny.  Trump was hated.  He was attempted to impeach throughout his term.  And I’m not saying he wasn’t deserving of some of the hate.  He is a big mouth ego-maniac, and that type of person brings out a lot of resistance.  But, he wanted to get some of the career DC people out of DC, and that threatens a lot of people.  They couldn’t stand for it.</p>

        <p>When the virus first hit, I immediately suspected it was another attempt to get Trump out of office. Throughout the lockdowns, riots and 'mostly peaceful protests' that were against Trump, such as BLM and so on were claimed by the mainstream media to not be super spreader events. And when Trump suggested HCQ as a potential cure for COVID, his opponents and the FDA immediately jumped on it. (Totally not suspicious or politically motivated)</p>
<p>Then COVID made the idea of fraudulent mail in voting acceptable, which further gave the Democrats opportunity to steal the election.</p>
<p>Now that Trump was out, I was hoping life would return to normal and the COVID would disappear. I did not expect COVID to be just the stepping stone to something bigger.</p>

        <p>One problem I have with this is that in the political context conversation, everyone I talked to irl (especially in the first few months) was convinced that "covid will probably 'magically disappear' when Biden gets into office and life will go right back to normal"</p>
<p>Yet here we are... Biden has been in for half a year, and we are nowhere NEAR back to normal, and the covid propaganda certainly did not go <em>poof</em>.</p>

        <p>True enough.  But, there is evidence, smoking guns, if you will, that the wind down of the pandemic began as soon as the election was over.  For instance, the MONDAY following the general election, saw one vaccine company announce that the vaccine was ready.  Why not release this information just the week before?  One week before the election.  I believe this was part of the process.  Another smoking gun:  numbers started declining the week following inauguration.  Of course, the numbers came in crazy high from end November '21, through mid January, so that kind of negates my point.</p>
<p>The reaction from shills around the world, with their masking and their attitudes overall, just comes from their combined place of personal insecurity, which has been building for quite some time, even before Trump.  There was evidence of the coming wave of soy boys and changing dynamics back in the early 2010's, as social media began to infect the world.  </p>
<p>Point: social media brought the pandemic to new levels. The real virus is the online world.</p>

        <p>When in the Uk after a short time Covid was down graded from a high consequence infectious disease, then there was the news that the average age of death from covid was \~84 compared to the 82 average age of death all causes. Then the 99.97% survival. I mean once we knew it really wasn't the lethal disease the TV pictures from China and Italy showed, there was no reason at all for lockdowns etc to continue. You could only assume there was another agenda which needed the pandemic to continue</p>

        <p>Same thing for me. What sparked it was Dr Stella Immanuel using HCQ, and personal anecdotes from aussie diggers (army) saying they developed antibodies to Covid because they were using it for malaria during the PNG occupation, and some using it to treat lupus. </p>
<p>Also, a TV series “Dead zone” had a coronavirus episode using chloroquine to treat SARS in 2002, yet the FDA didn’t publish information about that being effective against SARS until 2005. www.c19study.com www.hcqmeta.com https://aapsonline.org/freehcq/</p>

        <p>I think when it all settles in the smoke is gone it will be data that we can utilize to identify exactly what really happened.  </p>
<p>Observing annual mortality for the previous decades, 
Comparing that information with leading causes of death for the previous decades.
Comparing that with annual mortality of 2020 and leading causes of death in 2020   </p>
<p>It's hard to predict exactly what we will see, but my hypothesis is we will see egregious gaps and holes, inconsistent statistical data throughout decades.   </p>
<p>It kind of happened in the early 2000s when they recorded over 400,000 deaths from tobacco use.  During the time of elevated tobacco deaths, we saw a dip in congestive heart failure, a dip and death caused by diabetes, a dip and death caused by medical accidents.  Annual mortality stayed the same, trucks on very consistently, all causes of death aggregate and flow depending on the hot button issue of the decade.  </p>
<p>So at a time when America is the unhealthiest it's ever been in its entire life, metabolically, causes of death from congestive heart failure diabetes and other poor health related issues should be at an all-time high for the year 2020 and the year 2021.  </p>
<p>Will it be? 
The data will tell a story, as long as people are complex enough to pick it up and read it.</p>
