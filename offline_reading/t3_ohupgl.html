    <strong>If you're still in fear of Covid I feel sorry for you</strong>
    <p><p>The more time goes on I honestly believe people are getting sick and tired of Covid19. I can say from a state that required everyone to have masks inside AND outside it's amazing seeing more masks off. Sure there are still some that wear them, but honestly I think the ratio is a solid 80 to 100 ratio in terms of more people without masks than with. I honestly don't want to be the one who says vaccines played a part in it even though MA was one of the states that had people get vaccinated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look regardless of anyone's vaccinated status I am just glad people are starting to relax more and take them off. I think we can all agree that the people we really should be concerning ourselves with are the ones who get vaccinated AND still wear a mask. Like come on stop using the "I am protecting myself against you" excuse. Anyone out there at least in the US can decide if they want to get vaccinated or not. If they know they are healthy enough that they can through Covid OR even had Covid but was able to recover from it then why are you so concerned about them getting it now? Stop beating yourself up if you think you're going to give someone else Covid19 and they die. YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A VIRUS YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER SPRAEDING! STOP BLAMING YOURSELVES FOR BELIEVING YOU'RE SOME KIND OF MURDER FOR SOMETHING THAT INFECTED YOU AND PASSED ONTO SOMEONE ELSE!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For goodness sake the amount of people that are STILL concerned about Covid is crazy. WE HAVE VACCINES! WE HAVE NATURAL IMMUNITY! You have not even worn the KN95 mask that is actually the only mask that can be somewhat helpful. Not these silly cloth masks that you made out of your old shirt. Or these Spiderman masks you bought off of Amazon. They didn't want you wearing the proper masks that would actually be somewhat useful because they knew you wouldn't like wearing them all the time! They wanted you to wear "comfortable" masks so they could "have you think" you were doing the "right thing" when all what you were doing was obeying government orders.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Oh and I just love how other people want to say we "spread misinformation"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Have been right about the Wuhan Lab</li>
<li>Have been right about Fauci and the CDC funding the lab</li>
<li>Have been right about vaccine passports (Green Pass, Excelsior Pass)</li>
<li>Have been right about vaccines being mandated</li>
<li>Have been right about the media lying about the actual amount of Covid cases and or deaths.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I mean that's just 5 things I can already think of on the top of my head that we have been right about. Yet you have these people who think we need masks forever, get everyone vaccinated, wear gloves, host vaccinated only parties. Like it's all just so gross how about you live your own damn life how you please and stop trying to make other people do the same will yeah?!</p></p>

        <p>Seriously. In March of 2020 I was cautious. By April of 2020 I couldn't give less of a shit and could see the writing on the wall after the first few rounds of goalpost moving.</p>

        <p>Same. Only reason I was actually kind of concerned the first couple months of that year was because I strongly suspected it to be a leaked CCP bioweapon.</p>

        <p>It's validating to see someone else say this. March 2020 we were cautious, but always more afraid of what was going to happen with people as this whole thing unfolded than afraid of the virus itself. Because it was clear this was no accident.</p>

        <p>I was on a cruise ship the first week of march 2020 with an unlimited drink pkg and kept getting Corona's. I gave zero fucks the entire time.  The entire cruise was a shit show since it was during spring break too.  Tons of people making out and all over each other.  Zero fear of Corona. Much more scared of whatever the fuck the governments are trying to accomplish.  Since none of this makes sense.</p>

        <p>Went to the Oregon zoo yesterday, was pleasantly surprised to see a solid 80-90% unmasked.  The ones that were masked also masked their kids though which is sad</p>

        <p>I was never in fear of Covid itself. What I was and still am in fear of is governments using Covid as an excuse to systematically eliminate freedom and destroy society as we know it. Unfortunately that part has become true.</p>
