    <strong>The amount of cucks I see...</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been getting so many comments lately like “oh your mask should be over your nose,” “please put your mask on properly.” Like no it shouldn’t, it should be off because I’m not about to do surgery. I’m so bloody sick of these morons. And it’s so innocent too the way they say it. </p>
<p>I swear they’ll all stop wearing the masks once the government says it’s safe, or when Fauci says to stop wearing them - oh wait, he has said that. Fauci at the beginning mentioned they don’t work and they’re useless haha! People are actually mentally retarded without any ability to think critically.</p></p>

        <p>He did admit that they might work as kind of a safety blanket, assuage people’s fears, make them more comfortable or whatever. But yeah, he basically was of the opinion that they do nothing to actually stop the spread of this virus. </p>
<p>The fact that we went from that to “Experts say that 3 masks is better than 2” in only a year is ludicrous.</p>

        <p>My understanding of the no mask logic at the beginning of the pandemic is like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The flu is mostly only contagious when you are showing symptoms (coughing, sneezing, runny nose). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wearing a mask when you have symptoms will help slow the spread</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you don't have symptoms and wear a mask you experience the "safety blanket effect" and could result in you touching something with covid on it and then touching your mask, thus infecting you. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But when if instead we assume that covid can spread when you talk or breathe, this changes everything. Yeah wearing a mask increases the likelihood that you will get it IF you are exposed but it decreases the likelihood that I you will spread it. And if everyone wears masks, you decrease the likelihood that anyone will be exposed, thus reducing the spread.</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain his opinion that masks arent useful is based on the idea that you don't spread the flu unless you have symptoms. Part of this is what makes covid so novel. Now maybe it was made up to restrict people but there really is no proof of that. In the end I don't see a flaw in this argument. Especially since information changed (even if you think it was fabricated, which had not been proven).</p>

        <p>I would love to see more data on asymptomatic transmission of the coronavirus that causes covid 19. I realize that it’s difficult to obtain that data, but if we’re going to require healthy people to take unprecedented measures to stop the spread of this virus, there needs to be more justification than we currently have been given.</p>

        <p>I think I will be able to avoid comments because, one, I’m a bit over 6’ tall, and that keeps a few ratfaced fucks away.  But, two, if they say anything to me about my non-compliance, i tell them point blank to “get fucked” and carry on my way.</p>

        <p>What if they say it’s required to have one? I don’t wear one or I just take my business elsewhere. I’ve been doing research on this and it turns out I think you can submit some form if they discriminate like that. If they fire you for some reason for not wearing a mask, then you can file it and possibly get some money for the damage they caused. This is all unconstitutional at the end of the day, it’s not even federal law, just suggested</p>
