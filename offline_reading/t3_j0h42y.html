    <strong>What’s all this about a virus?</strong>
    <p><p>What’s up team, </p>
<p>So it’s been a while since I plugged into the internet and I was wondering if you kind folks could fill me in?</p>
<p>I went out to the shops yesterday to pick up some bits and pieces and got choke slammed to the ground while a mob of angry Karens chanted “Spreader! Spreader!”. I barely had time for a breath before the boys in blue had me slammed up in the can, told me I’d be fined 3 hundred quid for not following government advice. </p>
<p>Me mam used to tell me not to climb trees in case I should fall, but she never bloody pushed me off. That was advice, this was ransom! Think I must’ve missed something in the news as I’ve not watched the telly in a wee while. I can’t understand what’s made everyone so angry, there’s plenty of fresh air to go round.</p>
<p>Everywhere I go there’s folk telling me I just killed their nan but I’ve never even met the lady. I’m sure she’s a star though. One fella asked if I could read, as there’s plenty of information around the place. I said I’m sorry I’m mentally challenged, my IQ’s only 45. He said aye that’s no bother, the government advice is aimed at people like us. Sad story really, as he was about to tell me all aboot this virus he slipped down the gap between the train n the platform. Got sucked under. If only the government had told the nice fella to watch the gap.</p></p>

        <p>I think this "pandemic" gave the perfect opportunity for people to channel out their inner Karens, with the added bonus of anonymity given by a mask.</p>
