    <strong>Family refusing to travel with me because no vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>My mom, Stepdad, Dad, Stepmom, Sister, cousins and grandparents have all been double vaccinated, and continue pressuring me to do so. </p>
<p>While talking with my Mom and Stepdad today, they informed me that they don't feel comfortable &amp; won't travel with me until I have been vaccinated for the next 5+ years, despite them having 2 doses and taking all COVID precautions.</p>
<p>I told them that is absurd, and they are segregating me from the family for a virus with a 99.997% survival rate for my age group. Yet they remained adamant, stating that they can travel because theyre vaccinated and "won't catch/transmit covid" - Yet if I travel with them I could "catch it and bring it back" </p>
<p>I can't help but feel isolated from them, and hurt by the tyranny that COVID has caused to my relationships with friends and family. I miss the world where I could live and move freely. I hate how this causes people to think and live in fear.</p></p>

        <p>Telling someone you don't want to be around them because they are not vaccinated is not pressuring them.. Its just telling them that your choice means they don't want to be around you.   And that's their right, just like its your right to choose not to be vaccinated.   </p>
<p>I'm against you being forced to be vaccinated, but i'm 100% behind excluding unvaccinated people form public settings/events/schools to protect all those that are vulnerable. </p>
<p>If you feel pressure to get vaccinated because you want to be around  them, thats on you.  not them.  Respect their wishes, just like you want them to respect yours.</p>

        <p>But you are protecting everyone if they are sick.  The issue is that covid can take 5-14 days for symptoms to show and 20-50% of infected people are asymptomatic.   You can be infectious if you are asymptomatic and you are infectious when you are pre-symptomatic.    </p>
<p>If there was no risk of hospitalization or death from Covid this wouldn’t be an issue but that unfortunately not the case and it’s far more infectious and deadly then the flu by up to 20 times.  </p>
<p>If you aren’t vaccinated and want to attend an event are willing to be masked and take a Covid test immediately before entering the event?</p>

        <p>asymptomatic spread is a myth, please tell me how i'm going to infect someone with a respiratory illness spread by droplets if i have no symptoms to even release said droplets? in all this time of people propogating this lie not 1 person has been able to answer this. maybe the test but if its negative why the need for the mask? that doesn't make any sense at all. luckily every event and place i've attended recently wasn't ran by hypochondriacs and neither was required</p>

        <p>Do you breath ?  Yes.  Water vapour and droplets are expelled when you breath or talk or sneeze or cough.  </p>
<p>It’s clear you lack any understanding of human biology. Heh. It’s insane how confident you are of  your reposnse when you are completely wrong. </p>
<p>It’s not a myth.  I mean you go easy to and read studies directly on this.  Even if you just read the abstract and conclusion.    Do something to inform yourself so you are talking form point on knowledge so you are yourself spreading lie or misinformation. </p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707</p>
<p>Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread are the main causes of spread since everyone isolated or stays home when they have symptoms right?  Is that your argument or what others above have said?   Stay home when you are sick.  But if you already infected people before your symptoms show it’s too late.</p>

        <p>i've never infected anyone because i haven't felt sick in over a year lmao. that's definitely not my argument since it's not a thing and as many articles there are saying it is i can find the same number saying its not. even your holy lord and savior mr. fauci said it's not the main spreader of the virus. droplets from breathing are not nearly enough to expel a viral load large enough to spread, and sneezing and coughing would mean you are symptomatic.</p>

        <p>not feeling sick has NOTHING to do with if you are infectious or not. </p>
<p>Article and clinical studies are not equal.. Go read the studies yourself..</p>
<p>the study clearly shows that asymptomatic people living in the same house spread it to other memebers in the house.</p>

        <p>Small pox was erradicated by mass vaccination of 20 year meaning the vast majority of people were vaccinated against it. </p>
<p>You are living free.. You are free to make choices that affect you directly (and other indirectly)  those same rules apply to people so if they choose to be vaccinated, and then choose to not be around unvaccinated, that their choice.</p>
<p>You are fool if you think you are allowed to make choices for your own health and safety but someone else cant if it negatively effects you.. </p>
<p>You are either for the right for you and others to choose whats best for them and their body/health or you are an ignorant fuck that thinks only you can choose what right for you and others can't if it also effects you, even though your choice not to be vaccinated effects those around you.</p>

        <p>No, it took hundreds of years beginning with inoculation.</p>
<p>You're into segregation if you think vaccination against this mild virus - yes, it is mild - is a requirement for living a free life. So what, if people aren't vaccinated (those who can't, or those who don't wish to, or those who had natural immunity which judging by SARS1 is most likely lifelong), they should never participate in human life?</p>
<p>If you are at risk, yes, absolutely, get it. If you are not? Yeah, your choice.</p>
<p>I don't give a fuck about other people. If you are at risk and afraid, get vaccinated. If not, don't. It is called individual responsibility and freedom, two things we flushed down the toilet in 2020 never to be seen again.</p>

        <p>Small pox killed 500 million people before the 20th century, and it was erradicated by vaccines..</p>
<p>People that have medical  issues that can't be vaccinate should be given exemptions.  Its those that we are trying to protect with herd immunity for covid and all other viruses. </p>
<p>If you actively make a choice not to be vaccinated stop the spread of the virus and remove the strain and risk to healtcare systems and vulnerable people then you are fully accepting that your choice is going to cause you to be excluded from some parts of society untill effective treatments are developed to stop infection from being severe.   Surely you wouldn't use those treatements though right since they woud still be granted EUA and won't have passed 2 years of clinical trial data. </p>
<p>But cool.. You don't give a fuck about other people.. It just shows what a piece of shit human you are, and you should NEVER be given ANY sort of social assitance or funding, healthcare every again since  no one should care about you right?</p>
<p>Individual responsibilty.. Cool.. I can go get drunk or high as fuck and climb into my super expensive modern SUV with all the enhanced safety features knowing i'm fully protected in a crash and i shouldn't care about anyone else life that i effect or kill on my drive home..

        <p>It’s not my job to coddle stupid fools like you who want to segregate society based on vaccination status for a mild virus, which will be endemic and always with us regardless. Reddit ain’t the real world thankfully.</p>
<p>Should you then be at fault for someone spreading flu or a cold that killed someone? We are always going to be in chains of transmission for anything. Should I blame the person who gave me swine flu or COVID? No, as I’m a rational person who realizes this is part of life and my health is my responsibility alone, so I don’t give a fuck. Just as yours is yours alone and you should only mind about your own self, and your risk factors. Denying people the ability to be free humans is sick and disgusting but that’s what lockdown policy is based in.</p>
<p>I suppose when you don’t get your flu shot you should stay home too and never partake in society, killer !</p>

<p>Covid is not mild.  The current seasonal flus could be considered mild.  I now a few people that had covid.  The majority were very sick at home and lost 10-14 lbs from puking and shitting themselves for days.  One Was in the hospital and is now off work with a heart attack (fit late 50s)  5 weeks after being sick.   His Wife was in the Er Multiple times.    Relatives have died, and one friend had a mild cold while his parents were bed ridden.. Nothing about the flu is similar to Covid. and Flu incubation is normally 1 to 2 days allowing you to stay home when you show signs blocking transmission.</p>
<p>The flu seldomily kills people in comparison to covid and doesn't have such severe symptoms.  </p>
<p>Denying someone entry into an event where vaccination is required is just something you will have to accept since you choose not to be vaccinated.    But maybe that needs to be addressed.  Why did you choose not to be vaccinated?</p>

        <p>CFR is irrelevant, what you want is IFR.</p>
<p>IFR is something like 0.12% and LOWER if you are under 70.</p>

        <p>you can't accurately calculate IFR without wide spread asymptomatic testing so please tell me the magic formula you are using to calculate your IFR.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic cases are at the most 50% with more recent data suggesting its closer to 20 - 30%.  But if you think 50% are asymptomatic and not tested that still puts the CFR at 1%.  or everyone 1 person out of 100 dies from the infection...</p>

<p>When you start your own family, remember this moment.  My parents did all kinds of fucked up shit.  The only thing I was unsuccessful in avoiding was that my oldest daughter is raised by divorced parents.  But she still has a stable household here when she is here.  My youngest two are with my current wife and divorce between us is highly unlikely, we've had our marriage tested to a major breaking point and we powered through that.  </p>

        <p>The wife and I are in the same position with her parents, I feel you mate. Everyone else in the family is vaxed, or planning on getting it.</p>
<p>Hang in there and know you aren't doing anything wrong 🙏 We have gone through all the stages of grief over this year+, and we're totally in acceptance now. What has really helped us through this is Stoicism ("Daily Stoic" is a good intro). There is nothing we can do to change their mind (specifically my step-mother). They are entirely in fantasy land, and tbh she does not hear the things I say. Why bother struggling against this to win this unwinnable fight? We no longer do, and we don't sugar coat our opinions. I've also found that trying to find a compromise just makes things worse, as it just confuses my step-mother as to what we are actually willing to do, and sets bad expectations for the future. You can't change their opinion, and you should not try. But be true to yourself, and unapologetic.</p>
<p>Now the hardest part is when you talk about this (either in the present or in the future when this is all over) and you are blamed for not seeing your family. Here is where the Stoicism pays off again: it is obvious they are going to feel you are the problem, and you know you are not, so there's no reason to be angry/reactionary. It takes practice and effort to get to there, but you just need to be confident in your choices, mate. Your reality right now is that you <em>do not</em> have the choice to take the vax. Not while remaining yourself. Never relent on this point, you are not the one making the decision that leads to not seeing them. They may as well ask you to commit murder in order to see them, and would have the same right to blame you for not doing it. You have no choice, as it is against your morals. </p>
<p>Just don't fall into the trap of thinking that your family is "bad" or "the enemy". They are thinking of the short term, due to fear, and you are thinking of the long term (not complying is hard now, but pays off later). People make mistakes, and especially your parental figures may think that they can pressure you into the 'right' decision for your own good. Make the best of your time apart from them, accept it is through no fault of either yours or theirs, and hopefully you'll have moved passed any negative emotions by the time you see them again. If you welcome them with open arms, while showing no remorse, while they are a bit pissy or worse, it will register with them.</p>
<p>Best of luck. Feel free and PM.</p>

        <p>Imagine them being such narcissistic dumbasses that they think you can't catch covid if you're "vaccinated." Luckily if they DO get sick, obviously you will be blamed in their infinite wisdom.</p>

        <p>They're ideologically possessed and likely a lost cause until they wake up, if they ever do. I suggest networking with like minded people and being less-reliant on family for things. Not cutting them off completely but not allowing them to impose their ideology on you.</p>

        <p>If they believe they won't catch it, they can't turn around and say that you catching it will transmit it to them. It's astonishing how they don't see the hypocrisy. If I were you I'd cut myself off from them and just hang out with friends who care about me, it's their loss.</p>

        <p>I felt isolated from my left-leaning family members long before COVID.  But the year 2020 taught me that I'll never see eye-to-eye with these people.  Our ideologies are way too different to have anything more than a superficial relationship. </p>
<p>And that's ok...</p>
<p>I agree with the commenter who said there are billions of people in this world for you to relate to... and travel with if you want.  I'm sure you love your family, and you don't have to cut them off... just don't let them force you to do something you're ideologically against. </p>

        <p>Tell them you decided to get vaccinated, it's the right thing to do after all, and you don't need to be getting sick. </p>
<p>Go on trip, have fun. At some point of course it will come up.  When someone says to you "aren't you glad you got the covid vaccine?" say "covid vaccine? are you nuts? No way I'd do that!" and of course they will get pissy and say you said you were vaccinated! "Of course, I decided it was a good idea to get a flu vaccine, didn't want to get sick for the vacation!"</p>

        <p>I'm pretty fortunate. It didn't take TOO long for my family to be free from this BS, and it never was really that bad. I've got a mom and 3 sisters close by, all of us with kids, no distancing and pretty sure none took da poke. I couldn't imagine what you're going through. I hope you have some good friends.</p>

        <p>Mate. This isn't what you want to hear, but it's what you need to hear. You need to cut them loose, and forget about them. YES! Cut your family loose. They are all ticking time bombs and their day will come. </p>
<p>The earth is splitting in to 2; vaccinated vs unvaccinated. You know where this is going. The world is about to be divided completely; what side will you be on? Death vax, or the free? But if you choose free, get ready for the biggest persecution the world has ever seen. For it is told in the Bible. These are just birthing pains. We are either in the beginning or Tribulation or Tribulation is just around the corner. There are more years of this mess to come, and it is only going to get periodically worse until God puts a stop to it. For the entire earth would be destroyed if not for the elects sake to cut it short. We are at the end game, fellas.</p>

        <p>It's impossible for me to picture myself in your situation and would be selfish of me to even try to understand how it must be for you, I have a couple of things to say nonetheless.</p>
<p>Don't give in. I believe there are "some" things that we, as a social species, can give up to be socially active (to some extent). But we are talking about a literal medical procedure, DO NOT GIVE IN. It's your choice and that's IT.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you are mentally OK, I (again) don't even know how this situation would affect me but I'm guessing being socially pushed away from your own family isn't fun. My ignorant advice would be to ignore it and move on with your life, at this point, your personal growth is x10000 more valuable than having to deal with your situation.</p>
<p>And finally I'm sorry. I really truly wish the world wouldn't let these things happen but this is how it's playing out and defending yourself from being brainwashed might be the only way to progress.</p>

        <p>I had similiar story, but I won against them now. I am looking for my mom and dad aswell. If it happens that I die, they are going to be screwed aswell, they don't have anything, they have a lot of debt aswell. I am employer, my personel will be jobless, which one of them has a pregnant wife. Many lives will be ruined, just because you old ass could maybe %0,01 chance, die. I said that to them. They gave up, kind of.</p>

        <p>In a similar boat to you ( at least my dad is anti-covid vac though). Family, just like a friend group, can be toxic. In my experience it's best not to cater to their expectations, because often those people are not the kind of people you want to be around anyway. I know it's hard with family, but it's best to stand your ground, and try to go on with your normal life (even though that is hard given government regulations). I would suggest finding an activity you can all do together ( board game), as this will gradually tear down their walls.</p>

        <p>Just as it’s your choice not to be vaccinated it’s their choice to not travel with someone that is not vaccinated. </p>
<p>It’s sucks for you for sure, but you have to respect their choice just as they should respect your. </p>
<p>It’s kinda silly to essentially cry that something your choose to do/no do leads to outcomes you don’t like.   You can’t fault them for not wanting to be around unvaccinated people.  If you really want or travel with them you can get vaccinated.    If your want to not get vaccinated is stronger then wanting to travel with them then that’s okay too.  You can choose to be with whomever you want,  ut it doesn’t mean they ah e to want to be around you. :)</p>

        <p>Sounds to me like they are being very responsible. Look I know this sub is full of people denying reality but let's be real here his family don't want their son to be responsible for spreading covid amongst their community and I applaud then for that. This little echo chamber can delude themselves all they want but not taking the vaccine is the action of a selfish child who puts themselves above anyone else even in this case the ops family.</p>
