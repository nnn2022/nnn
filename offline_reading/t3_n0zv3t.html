    <strong>All Doomers Are The Same, From My Observations.</strong>
    <p><p>So, waiting in long ass lines and observing these obedient slaves of the government, I have come across the conclusions that, they all have the same characteristics. The Men who are wearing the most masks, and dictating others in their gay ass voices and saying "Hey wear the mask, you killing grandma" are fat and have no spine. I legit see these people walking alone with 2 masks, and when I'm doing My thing, I never wear a mask in a store until I'm told to, these people look at Me like I'm from a different planet. I like to intimidate them, so they look the other way not even realizing how big of a fools they are.</p>
<p>So, being a good little boy/girl for gov and obedient and keeping their ass bent over 24/7 is in their genes. And, the women who have made a big deal for Me not masking are never the hot ones. So, once, I walk into a store with no mask, and not giving af, this trans thing whatever (short blue haired ,fat) and I can't seem to know what that thing is. It's dressed like a guy, but the feature's are of a women, and to get you an idea, that trans health official who got put by Biden, that thing looks like him. Anyways. In her loud bitchy voice she screams at Me " How dare you come into my store, not wearing a mask? People get killed because of you!" So, I listen and then tell her the facts, and suprisingly she told Me "You maybe right and make sense" And cherry on top I then leave, and she's like "aren't you buying anything?" I'm like, "I don't give business to foolish people like you." I then left, and overheard her swearing and got so pissed LOL. </p>
<p>Lazy, unambitious and having a spine so bent and an ass who is only thirsty for daddy government 24/7, is the perfect way to describe these people. They all share the same characteristics, views and ideologies. And alot of the anti makers who I have talked with, they are like Me. Free thinkers who dgaf and who live life to the fullest, and do what they gotta do. I'm glad there are some proper people, but they are becoming extinct. Personally, Were I live, Ontario is fucked. I see Myself having no bright future here due to dying economy and these lockdowns are getting to Me now. Here's a sub for the fellow Ontarians here.</p>
<p>Thank effing God, I have a USA passport. Most likely I'll go down to Texas or Florida. Freedom over everything. No matter how much money you have, it can't buy you power or freedom so f it. Life is an adventure and all about risks, so all of you Canadians save up and gtf out of this authoritarian, dystopian hellhole. Life is too fucking short to follow these tyrants. I didnt come in this life to be a slave and an lab rat. Enjoy life and do what you gotta do and plan accordingly. And F you doomers.</p></p>
