    <strong>Even if Covid was as bad as it was hyped up to be, I don’t understand the lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>Even if Covid had a 2% death rate, what about the other 98% of people in the population? </p>
<p>It seems selfish to sacrifice the vast majority of the population, for a tiny fraction of the population. </p>
<p>People die all the time, and that will never change. It seems people are obsessed with preventing all death now, whilst failing to realize death is inevitable. </p>
<p>And by trying to prevent all death, they’re hurting people mentally, their jeopardizing their livelihoods, ruining the economy, etc. Ironically raising the suicide rate, as well. </p>
<p>It seems incredibly irresponsible to throw 98 people off of a cliff to save 2 of those people. </p>
<p>“If it saves one life” fuck you. I care about the majority more than “one life”. What about everyone else’s life?</p></p>

        <p>They used the lockdowns to remove people from government that didn't follow their narrative. Remember in the early days when people were outraged when some politicians said Covid wasn't a big deal? They were all removed from power.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of the worldwide takeover by the totalitarian one-world government.</p>

        <p>Trump and Boris both opposed and surprisingly only politicians to get seriously ill with Covid. Both took their warning to toe the line - Boris more so than Trump. Trump seems to be fighting back more again rather than trying to take credit for the vaccines.</p>
