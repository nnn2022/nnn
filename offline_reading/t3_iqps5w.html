    <strong>One of our students is sick</strong>
    <p><p>But not with COVID-1984.  They tested her for that (because of course you have to test everyone who enters a doctor's office for it 🙄) and it came back negative, but her test for Strep Throat came back positive.</p>
<p>And guess what?  She's laid up in her dorm room for a couple days until she feels better.  Nobody gives a flying fuck, aside from a couple teachers who are mildly annoyed that she's going to miss class.</p>
<p>Where's the fear?  Where's the outrage that she might bring Strep home to her grandma?  Where's the "shut down the entire school! quarantine the entire dorm building!"  Where's the government-mandated stalker army to ask her what stores she went into last week?  How come asymptomatic classmates aren't all being forced to get Strep tests?  Why is the local paper not writing panic erotica about "healthy 20-year-old at XYZ University <strong><em>TESTS POSITIVE</em></strong> for Streptococcus Pyogenes!1!!  It's an <em>OUTBREAK</em>!11!!!"</p>
<p>Why do we ONLY do all that fucking histrionic bullshit for ONE pathogen?  Had it been the dreaded unproductive cough rather than a sore throat, we'd probably be shutting down and sending everyone home.  Why can't we just react to 'rona patients (especially college-aged) the same way we react to Strep patients?  How do the Coronabrains not see the absurd double standard here?</p></p>

        <p>So did actor Bill Paxton. The fever damaged his heart valve, but he soldiered on until his doctor thought it'd be a good idea to fix the damage. He was 60 and still in good health, so he had the surgery. Complications set in and a stroke, then he was gone. </p>
<p>Any respiratory infection carries a slight risk of complications, including heart or lung damage. SARS-CoV-2 is no special snowflake in that regard.</p>

        <p>Two summers in a row I had what I began to call the "Fourth of July Flu".</p>
<p>I got super sick and it started with one of my lymph nodes swelling to the size of a lacrosse ball and making it so swallowing was next to impossible. Then it progressed to insane fevers...I'm talking 4-5 days of burning up, breaking the fever and drenching the bed with sweat, rinse repeat and the worst headaches I've ever had that lasted for days. I was so weak that I had to have friends deliver basic things like deodorant and a toothbrush. I lost 25 pounds. Went to the ER, got blood tests, white blood cells were off the charts. After giving me IV fluids I was sent home to recover which took about two weeks. And this happened for two consecutive summers. </p>
<p>Do you know how many times I was contacted by someone in Public Health? ZERO.</p>
<p>Do you know how many times my doctor followed up with me? ZERO.</p>
<p>Do you know how much sympathy my employer had that I could barely stand, let alone do 8 hours of work? ZERO.</p>
<p>Do you know how many "long term effects" I have? ZERO. </p>
<p>The moral of the story is that no one cared to investigate what I had because it wasn't the disease du jour. No one cared because, HUGE SHOCKER HERE, people get sick. I'm truly frightened to see how this shell shocked society handles people when they get the common cold or the flu. I can only imagine that we'll be shutting down offices when anyone comes down with Influenza A or B because...ya know...Nana.</p>

        <p>One Fourth of July I got badly sick. High fever, weakness, a rash, felt like I was dying. Even though I had no ring rash, my daughter thought it looked like Lyme, so I went to Urgent Care. </p>
<p>They tested me for it, but said that it could be any tick-borne illness, and they prescribe the same antibiotic for all of them.  24 hours later, I was nearly back to normal.</p>

<p>&rt;If untreated, strep throat can cause complications, such as kidney inflammation or rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever can lead to painful and inflamed joints, a specific type of rash, or heart valve damage.</p>
<p>Holy shit! Long-term effects! Organ damage! AGHHH!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh, but wait:</p>

<p>Sorry, false alarm. It mostly affects kids, not 80-year-olds. Obviously nothing to be overly-concerned about.</p>

        <p>I've seen countless stories exactly like yours, people who were in college in 2009 and got Swine Flu, and basically just stayed out of class until they felt better.  I was a little younger - in high school at the time, and as far as I can remember, the Swine Flu was basically just a meme for the most part.  No clue if anyone from my school had it, since they didn't plaster every positive case on the local newspapers like they're doing with COVID-1984.</p>

        <p>I am curious, unless she is sharing someone else's mask how could she catch something she didn't have prior? My only thought would be if she shared her mask. I totally understand that there must be some sort of dangers with wearing a moist mask for hours a day and never washing your mask, but I am pretty sure that the guidelines for wearing a mask say they shouldn't wash their mask if it is a reusable mask.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why can't we just react to 'rona patients (especially college-aged) the same way we react to Strep patients? How do the Coronabrains not see the absurd double standard here? </p>
<p>Maybe double standard is unfair. "Approximately 11,000 to 13,000 cases of invasive strep disease occur each year in the United States, resulting in 1,100 to 1,600 deaths." - <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Group%20A%20Strep.pdf">PA Health Dept.</a> COVID-19 deaths are nearing 200k in the U.S., granted, some will say "but they're old."</p>
<p>Also, strep already has a solid antibiotics business ($$$) to help control it. WAY more money in the development of a new vaccine to stop the spread of a NEW virus. And you're right -- that does require sustaining fear to some degree.</p>

        <p>And strep is petty contagious, and can have some pretty severe permanent side effects in a few people.   It really makes no sense.   I remember when a kid across the hall from me in my dorm had strep, everyone was really careful about handwashing and not sharing towels in the bathroom for a couple of weeks.   She got better and everyone survived.</p>

        <p>Because strep can be cured with antibiotics. And we know that the threat of strep is rheumatic fever. Antibiotics cure the strep and prevent heart damage from rheumatic fever. But we don’t have a cure for Covid and we aren’t fully aware of the effects of the virus.</p>

This virus was around for a few months before we found out about it. Do you know what that means? There could be a super virus right now that we won't find out about for a couple of months. Better to just hide in your basement forever.</p>

        <p>I definitely take strep seriously. My son and daughter had their tonsils out after they each got strep 6 times in a year. My daughter had PANDAS starting in second grade. My grandfather died at 52 from heart damage caused by rheumatic fever. Without antibiotics my children might have died. I’m not downplaying strep, I’m simply saying strep is known and it has a pretty simple cure. I agree we need to dial back Covid hysteria, but doctors do not understand the mechanisms by which heart, lung, and other organ damage occur. It takes time to study. My husband’s coworker just went into the hospital today with two blood clots in her lungs and just found out she is Covid+. Maybe you live in an area where it hasn’t affected you?</p>

        <p>I work in a virology research lab I am very much aware of the dangers of this disease and how many people are getting sick each day for my state. I just come here to point out some of the major lies of this subreddit. And sometimes to poke the native wildlife to see what happens.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the work you do! I think I might have replied to the wrong thread. I meant to reply to the person saying that we need to take strep seriously and Covid not as seriously.  So as a virologist do you think doctors understand the long term effects of Covid? Also curious what you think about it being produced in the Wuhan Lab (another Dr. from Wuhan claims she can prove it was).</p>

        <p>&rt; So as a virologist do you think doctors understand the long term effects of Covid?</p>
<p>Nope, and we won't know for sure for a few years, and we have definitive data on if people's lungs recover after severe cases. Not counting issues with possible secondary infections.</p>
<p>We can make some educated guesses after some cases people do have lung damage and that is not something that normally heals perfectly. Hopefully for people with lung damage will recover 95% function, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>As for keeping up with papers, its almost impossible to keep up with all the papers that are coming out for covid as it is a hot topic, and everyone is writing about it. I am only concerned about structure and diagnostics.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I don’t understand how my comment got so many down votes when it’s pure facts. Oh well! I’m not giving up though! I am skeptical about a lot, but comparing this virus to strep isn’t very smart (btw I’m a ma’am 😄).</p>

        <p>Even with antibiotics in play strep is no joke.   Strep needs to be taken more seriously in dorms and by you, and covid hysteria needs to be dialed back by x10</p>
