    <strong>The CDC is hiding the Covid death rates</strong>
    <p><p>This has been bothering me for some time, and I’m sure many of you have run into it too. It is <em>extremely</em> difficult to find the estimates for the Covid death rates by age. Try googling it right now - Covid death rate by age. Did you find it? I’ll bet you didn’t. You might’ve found <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html">this page</a> </p>
<p>Which is interesting but doesn’t spell out what the risk of dying is for the control group, so doesn’t exactly answer the question</p>
<p>You might’ve also found <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">this page</a> </p>
<p>Which I, as a statistics major, wouldn’t even want to mess with. It’s a complete filibuster of data that doesn’t directly point to anything. Also check out the huge disclaimer all the way at the bottom.</p>
<p>You can keep going through the google results and some estimates from other sources, but none from the CDC. So I kept digging a bit and came across this <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/22/tweets/viral-tweet-cites-made-cdc-covid-19-survival-rates/">bullshit fact check </a> </p>
<p>It analyzes the following claim from a conservative blogger: “Age 0-19 — 99.997%. Age 20-49 — 99.98%. Age 50-69 — 99.5%. Age 70+ — 94.6%. Why is a COVID-19 vaccine being pushed out so aggressively? Hmmmm.”</p>
<p>We’ve all seen these numbers before - I’ve seen them on this sub numerous times including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mgka6t/these_covid19_survival_rates_really_have_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">here</a></p>
<p>But politifact rates the claim as “false”. Not mostly false, not somewhat false. Just outright false. They probably did that because they know the real numbers right? Wrong. They say it’s false because “CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told PolitiFact that the agency has not released any age-specific COVID-19 survival rates, nor does it have mortality rates available.”</p>
<p>First of all - what?? It’s a year into the pandemic and you don’t have an estimate of how many people who get it die from it by age group? These people could estimate how many grandmas will die in Tulsa if someone removes their mask in Spokane. But when it comes to one of the most basic stats one would like to know during a pandemic, they’ve got nothing apparently. </p>
<p>Second of all, I realized this wasn’t true. The CDC 100% had a page up at one point that released estimates of death rate by age group. It was that pandemic planning scenario page they put up in September. If you wanna remember what it looked like then check out <a href="https://tallahasseereports.com/2020/09/26/cdc-releases-updated-covid-19-fatality-rate-data/">this article</a></p>
<p>In their scenario 5 <em>best estimate</em> they had the following rates:
*       Age 0-19 — 99.997%
*       Age 20-49 — 99.98%
*       Age 50-69 — 99.5%
*       Age 70+ — 94.6%</p>
<p>Well what do you know? It’s the <em>exact</em> same rates that politifact said were false! So much for CDC not releasing them right?
Ok so let’s check out <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1">the page</a> now:</p>
<p>Mind you, I had to get there by going through the link in the above article since google doesn’t bring it up right away. Look at the table now (wayy at the bottom)- it doesn’t show the death rates by % anymore, it’s presented by number of deaths per 1,000,000 infections <em>for ease of interpretation</em> (it says this at the very top). Is this a joke? It is way easier to interpret numbers as a % than deaths per million. </p>
<p>But ok let’s take a look...for the 18-49 group the number is 500. Gotta get my calculator out, do 500 divided by a million and what do I get? .0005 which if I’m not mistaken is .05%. That’s your chance of dying from Covid if you’re normal working age. Granted that’s more than twice what they had before, because this time they’re assuming there’s less asymptomatic spread. </p>
<p>Moral of the story is it is unnecessarily difficult into find this estimate, I think because if people saw that the risk was that low they would go back to living their lives. Instead, the CDC hides it at the bottom of a densely confusing page and the media never covers the rates. And when they do it’s in a bogus politifact “fact check”</p></p>

        <p>From what I understand age is the strongest predictor, followed by pre existing conditions. But I’d also like to see pre existing separated out because the under 60 death rates certainly have to be very skewed by medical conditions</p>

        <p>I am a software developer and realized a year ago that all the data is hidden and gone, pre- pandemic, they removed data in 2018.
Here is a statement I wrote about the issue of missing pandemic data.</p>

        <p>I agree that Nate Silver isn’t what he’s cooked up to be, and I think the appeal of his work is way more based on aesthetics than actual content. I’m wondering do you think they’ve hid/scraped the data entirely or do you think they’ve just made it intentionally harder to understand?</p>

        <p>It's just gone, they take huge efforts to not have actual data available. At any cost prevent data from being easily available. Which is hard to do because it's much easier to automate data like a river, let it flow. However every place in the planet has substantial staff devoted to preventing the daily data they prepare for management from being somehow available to citizens.</p>

<p>That's part of the problem. Using Bing, I was able to find deaths by age and cases by age on page 1. Of course, that means having to do your own math because CDC does not want to make it that easy.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's difficult. You can find pages that say they cite Provisional CDC data howevever:</p>

<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</p>
<p><strong>IMO the numbers don't even matter because the Case Guideline ICD Coding (U07.1/U07.2) and Contact Tracing Protocol (Interim-ID-02) literally invent cases and create the foundation for a death to be labeled Covid based purely off assumption which translates into morbidity data</strong></p>
<p>When a header on the CDC Case Guidelines page stated "(Interim-ID-01) CSTE will assume all untested targets during contact tracing are asymptomatic and be counted as a positive case" which was scrubbed from the site I hold exactly zero faith that these numbers are based in reality.</p>

If you find some good charts I can add them.

        <p>I've seen multiple references to exremely high numbers of people who test positive and are "Asymptomatic"</p>

<p>&rt;Over 85% of virus patients in UK asymptomatic: Study New research raises fears of ‘silent transmission,’ increases need for more widespread testing</p>

<p>&rt;Over 85% of COVID-19 Infections in China Went Undetected Early On — Number of mild or asymptomatic infections emphasizes need for mitigation measures</p>
<p>If these 85% numbers are true, how many people who tested positive from covid are "Asymptomatic", meaning they have no symptoms to die from, but that is still being used as a "Contributing Factor" in causing deaths with multiple factors?</p>
<p>Are 85% of the people who test positive and then die actually Asymptomatic?</p>
<p>https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/new-report-suggests-there-are-thousands-of-unaccounted-deaths-in-arizona</p>
<p>&rt;ABC15 asked Maricopa County health officials about a hypothetical question — if a person dies in a car crash, and tested positive for COVID-19 within the 60 days, would they be counted as a COVID-19 death?</p>
<p>&rt;The response: "Yes, the death would be added to the total because for Public Health, it is important to understand who died WITH the disease even if the disease was not the CAUSE of death. Obviously, fatal accidents are a small subset of the total."</p>
<p>What about slip and fall deaths? Heart attacks? Brain aneurisms? Strokes? Cancer? Diabetes? Alzheimer's disease? What are these small subsets, and just how small are they?</p>
<p>How many people in the Covid Death Toll were asymptomatic and died from issues unrelated to covid?</p>
