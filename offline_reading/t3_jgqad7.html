        <p>My kids have been back at school twice for 4 hours each day. They are 100% masks. Got the pre-recorded call last night. A teacher at some school 20 miles away, who was teaching fucking virtually tested positive. Uggdfsdx</p>

        <p>If that happens in my college, I would drop out, not buy into this bs and try to find something else to do instead. Either a job without these restrictions or something else.</p>
<p>Most people doesn't bother learning sign language, write things down and so on, so I would be "deaf" in a such scenario not understanding a spoken word. I've ASD, but I'm hearing. Talking to people when not seeing them is a nightmare. I can't stand phone calls or radios either. But with mask the sound is even more muffled and it goes from guessing or filling in missing words to not understand anything.</p>
<p>I relies a lot on facial expressions and context to understand like others does. My ability to hear intonation/inflection and distinguish, remember and recognize voices have gone to shit the last years. In addition same gendered and same aged people sounds the same, but sometimes with different dialects. Fortunately this isn't mandatory in college in my country, so only the pro lockdown teachers are wearing them. My class mates and the interpreter I'm borrowing from other students fortunately doesn't wear them.</p>

        <p>They had masks in indoor spaces anyway but I at least could understand everyone in class. I have a speech disorder so am exempt from masks ( or was I’m not sure what the attitude might be now) but mentally the thought of just being with everyone masked and looking so abnormal makes me depressed. I can’t stand it.  </p>
<p>I’m in my second year though. If I was in my first year I’d have deferred.  I’m more and more unmotivated</p>

        <p>That's understandable. I don't like the look either. I've a long history of criticizing conservative Muslims, Christians and so on who wants mandatory facial covering. My criticism have never been about religion and I saw the issues as more communication, emotional and freedom issue than always a gendered one. I've always found it difficult to communicate with people with face covering and never seen the appeal. I don't care if you're tall or short, religious or atheist, woman or man and so on - regardless of reasoning I don't understand why laypeople would wear it. You're off course free to wear whatever you want, but don't force any other to do it. </p>
<p>Masks limits my freedom to speech. I can't hear my own voice when muzzled and I can't use sign language either since it relies a lot on facial expression and mouthing combined with hand movements to be understood. Not hearing my own voice at all and only hear a muffled voice with incomprehensible speech from others annoys me.</p>

        <p>I’m currently studying IT.  I first wanted to learn a trade but it just wasn’t for me. I really didn’t enjoy it. And this was at the same college anyway so restrictions would be the same.  Here in the UK a lot of colleges have trade courses too.</p>
