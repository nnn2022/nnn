    <strong>Anyone who says “This could have been over if everyone just cooperated” is gaslighting you.</strong>
    <p><p>We’ve all heard it. A lockdown fanatic rationalizes the never-ending lockdowns and the shifting goalposts by blaming people who supposedly have not been complying. “This would have been over months ago if everyone just did what they were supposed to. Whether intentional or not, this is gaslighting.</p>
<p>Not only is this not true, but the exact OPPOSITE is true. Do these people not understand that “flatten the curve”, “slow the spread”, and “wait until a vaccine” all by definition mean stretching this out? Lockdowns do not eradicate viruses, they only delay the inevitable. As soon as the lockdown ends the virus spreads.</p>
<p>If our goal was speed, then this whole pandemic could have been over in a few weeks if we just let it spread through the population, while shielding the elderly and vulnerable of course. The entire point of “flattening the curve” was to drag this out. Slowing the spread and waiting for a vaccine all prolong and delay.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks lockdowns could have eradicated the virus from every corner of the planet is either lying, ignorant, or insane. Even countries that were praised for keeping out the virus are now suffering new outbreaks.</p>
<p>Never let lockdown enthusiasts gaslight you like this. They’re the ones who locked us inside and destroyed the global economy. These charlatans have caused unprecedented damage to our society, but they would rather blame you than own up to their mistakes.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; It’s destroying my spirit.</p>
<p>Pretty accurate way of putting it.  It truly breaks my heart to look around and see the majority of the world having lost its mind.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say I don't want to live in this world anymore.  I'm not suicidal and not considering it, but I really wish there was someplace I could go where people were fucking <em>normal</em>.  Where you people were free to make their own choices about locking down or wearing masks, and were free to openly debate the merits of these measures without being shouted down and ostracized.</p>
<p>I've never had less faith in humanity than I do right now.  It's like for the past seven months everyone around me has been saying "the sky is green" and refuse to accept anything else.</p>

        <p>I think some people enjoy the "lock downs" and, others, like to be wag their finger at how such and such group aren't wearing masks. Ho hum, day after day of the same shit. The worst though has to be Dr. Fauci and, how, he told us to "bite the bullet" about Thanksgiving.</p>

        <p>The question is, do lockdowns work or not? Now the evidence pretty plainly indicates they've done jack shit. I mean, just look at Sweden. Sure, some people died in nursing homes, but that's happened in places that had lockdowns too. The average Swede has been living normally and what's happened to them? Nothing. Sweden proves that you don't need a lockdown.</p>
<p>But that goes against the media narrative we've all hammered into our skulls the past 7 months. You're not supposed to question if lockdowns work! What are you, a Trumptard? Of course lockdowns work! And if they work the only explanation is they we're not doing them hard enough, or something.</p>
<p>Basically, these people can't think for themselves and they can't accept reality. They're not gaslighting you. They've gaslit themselves.</p>
<p>&rt; Anyone who thinks lockdowns could have eradicated the virus from every corner of the planet is either lying, ignorant, or insane.</p>
<p>For the most part, they're insane.</p>

        <p>We’ve basically done the opposite of what was done for every prior pandemic, then kept changing the rules and the guidance, and them blamed the people for not following the rules hard enough. Yet at virtually every step, cases have been unaffected, as if that intervention didn’t really matter.</p>

        <p>Good point. The big problem is that governments all over the place have backed themselves into a corner and now can't change course because that would be admitting liability for destroying billions of livelihoods. As you say, the virus "mysteriously" keeps popping up all over the place. It is impossible to eliminate the flu (they've been trying forever and still haven't succeeded). Also, the (so called) "test" they use has massive a false positive rate and should only be used for research purposes (according to the creator of it). It is not about clinically diagnosed infections, but about "cases" being fraudulently declared, not by a doctor, but by some faulty "test". We will never see the end of this until those in charge are criminally prosecuted for malfeasance.</p>

<p>Seems to be that they have no intention of stopping the lock downs and these other measures.  If they had the intention of stopping i would have imagined that they would atleast have stopped with the pro-mask and distancing propaganda, and countries all around the world just keeps doing it</p>

        <p>I was thinking about this in relation to Ontario, Canada. Even if we shut everything down in the province, and even while most things were shut down in the spring, flights were still arriving from other countries at the Pearson International Airport. Often, people tested positive for COVID from those flights, and still do, and even if they go into quarantine immediately after leaving the airport, they've still touched things there and maybe in a bus or taxi. The only way New Zealand was able to get rid of it, for a time, was to completely shut down their borders.</p>

        <p>I live across the border from Ontario, nothing was ever truly shut down. I worked daily almost through March, April and may with people that drove across the border. Heck semi trucks bringing us equipment were crossing the border during those times. I still see just as many Ontario plates on vehicles daily over here.  What they blast on cable news was bullshit, the stay sage stay at home orders only hurt the working class. Life is going to have to go on.</p>

        <p>It was definitely skewed, but don't think that the border is truly closed. It is only closed if you want to go enjoy your cottage or do something enjoyable(for us citizens at least). Over the summer the boats were still rafting up and that included many Canadian registered boats.</p>

        <p>People that enjoy sitting indoors regardless of the pandemic are the ones pushing this narrative. Lockdowns will only delay the spread of the virus unless governments took drastic action against their people which is impossible in our democratic world. Lockdowns delay the inevitable, not stop the virus in its tracks. We need to consider another approach but it's an approach that doesn't fit the agenda of governments across the world, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>Yup. My thoughts exactly. The "fall wave" in the United States would be quite a bit worse if we didn't use the summer to build some immunity in a controlled fashion. The states/countries with the worst outbreaks have not had much of a wave prior to this.</p>

<p>Anytime someone does something to distinguish themselves from being in lockdown - by going outside and being with the 3-dimensional people (as Phoebe from Friends once said!) - they get accused of being the reason why there has to be another lockdown.</p>

        <p>I really hope this doesn’t get taken the wrong way, but I think it’s all more complicated than it’s sometimes being made out to be. I really don’t think most people, regardless of their view, have had bad intentions. There are some things with all this that were out of everyone’s control for multiple reasons, some things that may have been somewhat controllable had we been prepared or taken more effective measures, and other things that we couldn’t have planned for because we just didn’t have adequate knowledge (this is a new virus after all and no one has a crystal ball to predict how it would evolve or what would have worked and what wouldn’t). I really think it’s of very little use to place blame at this point as well.</p>
<p>I will preface this with the fact that I am no fan of lockdowns. That said, they might have worked and been more effective had they been more coordinated and had we been more prepared going into them (and given people the proper safety nets to minimize damage on all levels and get it over quickly). The fact is we just weren’t prepared for this and it would have been hard to be adequately prepared. We may have been able to avoid lockdowns and months of social distancing had there been some sort of a plan in place to minimize spread, but there wasn’t and our health care systems were quickly becoming over loaded (and still are very likely at risk for that even though there is some evidence the virus has evolved to be less deadly, something which we never could have known for sure in the beginning). Like I said, I really think most involved did the best they could with the resources and knowledge they had at any given time.</p>
<p>Since we weren’t really prepared (and it would have been hard to be prepared to begin with), lockdowns may have been more effective if they were planned, coordinated, and done swiftly and strictly, which would be hard to do in the states anyway too. This, again, would have been challenge, but it may have gotten it under control faster and more effectively. We will probably never know for sure. That’s my opinion anyway. I don’t think herd immunity was (or likely is) a good short term solution because of the potential for tremendous loss of life, but more importantly, again because of the high risk of completely overloading our healthcare system. It just is what it is. If the lockdown was swifter and shorter and we instituted rigorous testing and isolation of smaller outbreaks after the lockdown, it very possibly could have been controlled better. I think the way it was handled is unfortunate, but I don’t know that we could have done much better based on our level of preparedness and knowledge at any given time since it was first discovered. It’s a shame that the way it’s continued to spread and the resulting restrictions have had such profound and lasting impacts for so many people. I know it’s really caused major problems for me personally as well and I would have much preferred we got it under control months ago. It’s going to have long term impacts on some areas of my life, just like millions of others. It sucks all around.</p>

You guys would rather choose that little bit of freedom over the hundreds of thousands of deaths and that’s just because it isn’t your loved ones who have died.

        <p>Yeah I uds that — I really wish treatment for other patients would still go on. That would be best. But other than that, wearing a mask and avoiding big gatherings is no more than a minor inconvenience to us healthy people. It doesn’t even affect your mental health to wear a mask and yet so many people in the states refuse to, thanks to their diligent FB research. If everyone tried to keep each other safe then lockdowns won’t even get prolonged.</p>

<p>That's blaming the victims of lockdowns based on zero evidence. All we have seen so far is that lockdowns inevitably come back, independently of our behavior. They are a criminal abuse of power without scientific support and with no democratic validity. This is everything this community has been against from the start.</p>
