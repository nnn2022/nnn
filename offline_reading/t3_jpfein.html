    <strong>Berlin hope</strong>
    <p><p>I have a a lot of friends in Berlin, many of them are muscians/djs. </p>
<p>While they don't like the second lockdown there, they are not doomers. </p>
<p>They feel like it is temporary. </p>
<p>What's more I think people have faith in the govt of Germany and understand that the lockdown is not forever and they will have their lives of dancing and fun again. </p>
<p>So maybe there is hope.</p></p>

        <p>It's nice that they are optimistic.</p>
<p>I'm a recent ex-Berliner after living there 10 years.</p>
<p>I'm not so optimistic, and I dont trust the government.</p>
<p>Did you know that the German government recently passed a law allowing intelligence agencies to hack any computer or device they want?  As in, they can make the ISP inject a trojan into your datastream so you dont even have to download or open anything.</p>
<p>So that's totally lovely and not weird at all, right?</p>

        <p>I don’t think it’s about the lockdowns lasting forever, but more so the precedence of the government stripping away rights and people submitting to it without question (or even begging for it in some cases.)</p>
<p>Some of these lockdowns include curfews. How in the fuck does a curfew relate to a virus? How does forcing everyone in their house at 10pm help? Seriously?</p>

        <p>Uh I'm German, and there is already politician talk (of course there is, keep boiling the frog) of how the lockdown needs to be</p>
<p>A) prolonged well into 2021
B) stricter, with schools closed and travel bans</p>
<p>I think you're seeing a "liberal" Berlin bubble at work; recent polls showed that not only do 50% of Germans appreciate the government and its pandemic management including lockdowns, but 25% are also asking for <em>more</em> draconian measures on top of what we have. Punish me harder, daddy. Germans also have a general propensity to long for strict leadership and accept invasive and overbearing measures, at least the western part.</p>
<p>"Cases" are exploding all over Europe, there are media depictions of hospitals being overwhelmed in Belgium, it's March-esque Panic Time again, many articles about triage from the big newspapers and magazines, now add some Danish mink farm mystery on top and shake it thoroughly, and you can probably tell that Germany isn't coming out of lockdown any time soon.</p>

        <p>&rt; They feel like it is temporary. </p>
<p>feels ain't reals</p>
<p>&rt; What's more I think people have faith in the govt of Germany </p>
<p>heh, 'faith' is belief, not knowledge. </p>
<p>&rt; and understand that the lockdown is not forever </p>
<p>the lock down will be somewhat lessened for those that submit. for those that refuse, worse than lock downs are in the works.</p>
<p>&rt; and they will have their lives of dancing and fun again. </p>
<p>i am not so optimistic on that. </p>
<p>good luck, you will need it.</p>

        <p><em>Current</em> lockdowns <em>may be</em> temporary, but that's not the point. The <em>point</em> is that all that is happening is not really about viruses. It's about control and Great Reset and all other inhuman agendas they may have.</p>
<p>No, I don't think this is temporary. No, I don't think there is much hope left.</p>
<p>Most probably this is forever in one form or other, because from now on we are essentially living in fascism. Totalitarian digital fascism. You'll have to distance and wear masks forever. Contact tracings forever. Plus yearly vaccinations with digital certificates in order to participate in any public activities.</p>
<p>This is the end of humanity. This is forever.</p>
<p>Humanity is done.</p>

        <p>Reverse Doomerism.</p>
<p>Only if you let them, mate. It only takes a match to light up a dry forest, figuratively speaking. </p>
<p>If just 20% of people in a given country:
Threaten a bank run (look it up) -- Threaten to not pay any taxes till this shit is over -- or - the workers on critical infrastructure such as power and water supply threaten to not work --  this will be over faster than a lamb can shake its tail. </p>
<p>It's just a question of whether or not, and when, we have the silent majority behind us. If not, the people probably deserve to descent into totalitarianism and technocratic dictatorship.</p>
