    <strong>The essence of the scam</strong>
    <p><p>The essence of the coronavirus scam of the largest capital is using lies about a new, lethal, all-powerful strain of the previously rather harmless coronavirus in order to cover up a COLOSSAL CRISIS OF OVERPRODUCTION (which makes profits plummet) and the TRANSITION TO OPEN DICTATORSHIP OF CAPITAL (=FASCISM) to combat the crisis. The "pandemic" hoax is also needed to avoid protests that have been increasing year after year due to increased economic exploitation around the world, including China.</p>
<p>Here, for example, in a 2017 Russian article <a href="https://carnegie.ru/commentary/71424">https://carnegie.ru/commentary/71424</a> the author talks about "a growing wave of worker protests that is sweeping many regions of China" and that "the number of large-scale worker strikes rose from 383 cases in 2013 to 2,663 in 2016".</p>
<p>Some more interesting excerpts from the article:</p>
<p>"In 2014, a wave of discontent rose in Henan （河南), Shandong（山东） and Jiangsu（江苏 provinces. More than two-thirds of all the actions recorded by China Labor Bulletin (which keeps records specifically of workers' protests) are strikes by workers at large factories, mines and construction sites. So we are potentially talking about the fact that discontent is growing among a sizable portion of Chinese society, which accounts for 20% to 30% of all workers"</p>
<p>"The problems are most acute in heavy industry (which accounts for up to 20% of the global total). For example, the China accounts for up to 46% of global overproduction in the steel sector." (Both Wuhan and Hebei province, the latter recently placed under fascist "quarantine" again, are major centres of the steel industry.)</p>
<p>"The fight against industrial inefficiencies is going to lead to massive worker layoffs: in the coal and steel industry alone, the authorities have promised to lay off 1.8 million people."</p>
<p>"Workers are still not allowed to organise trade unions and collectively resolve disputes with their employers on their own." "It is easy for the Chinese authorities to explain the fact that no data on the strike movement is published. In terms of formal legislation these protests do not exist. Since 1982, the right of workers to strike has disappeared from the country's constitution" (Chinese "socialism" in all its glory!).</p>
<p>So this is what happened in China: as the crisis caused by overproduction of goods grew bigger and bigger, Chinese capitalists periodically reduced production volumes and production costs by closing factories, kicking out workers, cutting wages, etc. This led to more and more strikes and protests. Chinese capitalists got caught between two fires - on the one hand, they had to slow down production by closing an unprecedented number of factories and laying off an unprecedented number of workers, cutting expenses on wages by not paying them for months or not paying them at all, etc. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-19/chinese-companies-say-they-can-t-afford-to-pay-workers-right-now">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-19/chinese-companies-say-they-can-t-afford-to-pay-workers-right-now</a> On the other hand, the reaction of the workers to all these actions was also going to be rather unprecedented. The capitalists realised that they could end up hanging off lampposts. What could they do? Well, for example, declare an epidemic of an unknown, deadly disease. That way, it would be possible to shut down enterprises, place them in "quarantine", put workers under house arrest, forbidding them to strike and protest under the pretext of the "omnipotent virus", refuse to pay salaries and wage debts on the pretext of "damages from the coronavirus", etc., etc.</p>
<p>Their example was followed by capitalists all over the world, except for those for whom this scam was not profitable.</p></p>

        <p>If only. Fascism is coming instead. Presidents in all capitalist countries are the executers of the will of the rulling class, i.e. the largest monopolies.</p>

        <p>It is refreshing to see a critical analysis of our situation from a genuine leftist perspective, not the liberalism that passes for "left" in the states. The reactionary right has gained such a following because it claims to offer a way out of the globalisation of production that has decimated the industry of Western nations, and an antidote to the hypocrisy of liberals. The socialist left needs to show that such ideas are not the sole purview of conservatives, and that a democratic human-first economy is the only way out of the cycle of economic collapse and escalating alienation that afflicts us.</p>
