<p>You convinced me. I now agree with your cult and want more malaria deaths, HIV deaths, tuberculosis deaths, starvation, suicide, depression. Those things matter not now that you asked me such a difficult question</p>

        <p>Yeah it's part of dealing with a global pandemic it is not just the US, nothing is easy and fighting a disease that is against humanity itself as our immune systems haven't gone against something like this before </p>
<p>People will die no matter what either from covid or being home for some reason as you say?? ( makes 0 sense  ) so the only way to stop it is to make it end quicker which is wearing mask and following covid protocols so it can be over faster </p>
<p>Not protesting the only thing that is helping even if it is not by a lot some is better then nothing</p>
<p>What will opening everything back up do? Please tell me</p>

        <p>No, it's not 'part of a pandemic.' We've been in a pandemic for over thirty years, and were in two simultaneously in 2009 (HIV and swine flu). None of this happened. It's the result of a general lockdown as opposed to a targeted lockdown of the clinically vulnerable.</p>
<p>&rt;or being home for some reason</p>
<p>'Some reason' is lack of necessary food and medicine; generational effects of poverty; mental health; substance abuse, etc. These are things that affect real people. Not you, apparently (lucky you!), but real people nonetheless.</p>
<p>&rt;What will opening everything back up do?</p>
<p>Is this a serious question? Production requires people to be able to produce things.</p>

        <p>Geeez someone didn't listen in school huh?</p>
<p>AIDS is a STD or blood transmittable disease you can't just get AIDS unless you have a serious interaction or fuck a monkey</p>
<p>Swine flu was able to be fought by our immune system due to similarities with past illnesses we fought in the past, their was no special swine flu vaccine just the generic vaccine same for AIDS lmao</p>
<p>Covid 19 is a respiratory illness that can be spread in several ways that compromise basic social human interaction such as being with a certain distance etc.  along with documented cases of asymptomatic transmitters and carriers </p>
<p>This is all basic knowledge you should've learned in elementary school besides the covid part I am honestly struggling to comprehend you tried comparing covid to AIDS lol please don't ev</p>
<p>And again EVERYONE is having mental issues and struggling etc. Just the majority aren't whiney little children who force our beliefs onto people and openly defy society  stop being a little bitch and grow up it is a part of life, plenty of places are hiring still so go get a job and buck up! </p>
<p>Also we just got a HUGE relief package which is extending unemployment so no one is suffering unless they are just not applying or disabling themselves cause it is easy to blame it on covid</p>

        <p>HIV and swine flu were both pandemics - the latter a highly-infectious RNA respiratory virus, just like SARS-CoV-2. The point of bringing them up was to show your claim that adverse effects of general lockdowns are 'just part of a pandemic' is false, and it is.</p>
<p>&rt;Swine flu was able to be fought by our immune system due to similarities with past illnesses we fought in the past, their was no special swine flu vaccine just the generic vaccine same for AIDS lmao</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Sounds like you need to read some science. 1) The H1N1 flu that caused the 1918 pandemic is extinct, like all pre-20th century flu viruses; 2) coronavirus is a very common virus family, with one member even causing the common cold. This has been a problem during the pandemic as certain antibody tests could yield false positives by detecting antibodies to the common cold. Here's an article from the <em>Journal of Clinical Microbiology</em>:  <a href="https://jcm.asm.org/content/58/8/e01029-20">Patients with Common Cold Coronaviruses Tested Negative for IgG Antibody to SARS-CoV-2 | Journal of Clinical Microbiology (asm.org)</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;I am honestly struggling to comprehend you tried comparing covid to AIDS lol please don't ev</p>
<p>You said the mass-death caused by general lockdowns are 'just part of pandemics.' The fact this was not the cause with AIDS and swine flu pandemics proved that wasn't true. Don't try to weasel out of it. It's not theory: up to a hundred million people are actually going to die, and if you're wrong you're wrong.</p>
<p>&rt;And again EVERYONE is having mental issues and struggling etc. Just the majority aren't whiney little children who force our beliefs onto people and openly defy society stop being a little bitch and grow up it is a part of life, plenty of places are hiring still so go get a job and buck up!</p>
<p>When you're done being a deranged sadistic dinosaur, notice the fundamental point: mental illness is 1) illness and b) fatal. If you true aim was to avoid illness-related death - not just sacrifice everyone else for your delusions of safety - you would <em>hate</em> the causes of mental illness. Instead, you cherish them and actively contribute to their danger.</p>
<p>&rt;Also we just got a HUGE relief package which is extending unemployment so no one is suffering unless they are just not applying or disabling themselves cause it is easy to blame it on covid</p>
<p>You don't know how production works, you don't know how people being able to move around helps; please don't tell me you don't understand how taxes and borrowing works! It's not free money!</p>
<p>This is what I despise about pro-general lockdown people. Most of them lead such pampered, trust fund lush lives where they get to do their hobby jobs from home and have plenty of 'rainy day' savings. That's just not reality for the vast majority of the planet, but they don't give a fuck: as long as they feel a teeny bit safer from a disease that almost certainly won't kill them anyway, they don't care who dies.</p>
<p>You demonstrate that admirably. You live to menace people poorer and less fortunate than yourself, hence all your policy preferences do just that, and are loving the pandemic because it gives you a way to feel good doing so. You're 'saving lives,' you tell yourself, as you condemn millions to famine and depression and poverty and death for your own sake.</p>

        <p>Also, 'our immune systems haven't gone against something like this before' is a complete lie. It is a coronavirus. The original SARS was a coronavirus. MERS is a coronavirus. One of the viruses that causes the common cold is a coronavirus. Its mortality rate for healthy under-60s is less than 0.2% - and that's just the known cases, including people whose causes of death weren't actually Covid.</p>

        <p>I appreciate you're grasping at straws, but don't miss the obvious:</p>
<p>1) You were wrong to say it is mutating 'rapidly.' It isn't. At all.</p>
<p>2) All viruses mutate. There is nothing humans can do to prevent that (even though our actions do influence which genes will be successful).</p>

        <p>Looking through your post and commenf history and how often you are on here I would go as far as to say you are a salty little loser who does nothing but hang out on subs like this lol and yet I'm the brainwashed one ? </p>
<p>You are literally on reddit everyday with barely anytime in between post or replies to conspiracy subreddits like this you are on here constantly more then likely cause your real life is a joke and you need a escape and you found it in this shit show of sub reddit which is the funniest shit ever</p>
<p>Grow up and get off reddit for a day it might help you get somewhere</p>

        <p>Haha. Who could possibly have time to access the internet on a daily basis. Only evil conspiracy theorists believing conspiracies. Have I said the word conspiracy enough yet? Yelling that word is my only tactic because I can’t actually argue any of the actual points of these subs:</p>

        <p>Fine line between hard and stupid. Really? The 2030 agenda is not a conspiracy theory"own nothing be happy",  masks are a lie, they dont work. Vaccines are making people sick while in the experimental stage . Also people's experiences dealing with pro masker and pro Vaccine  are not theories either.

        <p>I haven’t seen this sub described as anti-conspiracy. We welcome both the theorists and those that aren’t. It’s probably about 50/50. </p>
<p>Also, the sub isn’t based off any conspiracy theories, it is based on the idea that the “New Normal” is wrong in so many ways, and therefore detrimental to society worldwide.  <br>
It’s based on the recognition of the overreach of our governments in their attempts at controlling a virus.</p>
<p>Some people here may believe the actions are planned, but also many of us think it is just that natural tendency of those with authority to roll with whatever will bring them more. Power and control are addictive, and looking back at history, we see it happening time after time.</p>

        <p>I would say that the 90% of the content is based on what is being reported in the mainstream news cycle or straight from the horses mouth. So quite frankly, I fail to see the "conspiracy" in this sub-reddit.</p>
<p>People have been talking about the coming government tyranny for years (e.g., Alex Jones, David Icke, Yuri Bezmenov[6], George Orwell, Edward Griffin[7], Deborah Tavares) and we ignored their warnings, now the chickens have come home to roost. Now forcing people to get inoculated, vaccine passports[4], to depopulating the planet[5] isn't just a conspiracy any more. Or how about when the people behind the scenes are literally telling you what their intent really is[3].</p>
<p>Remember that old geezer Winston Churchill? He was called crazy, or for the lack of a better term a conspiracy theorist in today's terminology, because he was warning[1][2] Europe about the coming NAZI menace. Apparently either he or his advisors read Mein Kampf, and saw what was coming.</p>
<p>So before you come here with these types of questions, do your research, it isn't hard. When you're done doing the research, research more until your fingers are blue. The links below took me 10 minutes to grab.</p>

        <p>Uh, whether you believe in lizards or not, he has been warning about the coming government tyranny for years. You don't have to believe everything he says, but with the government tyranny that is here, he was spot on, just like David Icke, another lizard guy; just an FYI.</p>

        <p>&rt;As  a US Citizen who is Pro 2A my rights are just fine people like you are  just really insecure and have to use your rights to push people around  lol</p>
<p>Just curious, do you have any evidence or facts that I personally have violated any one's right? Oh yeah, I have a Glock 19, beautiful piece of Austrian manufacturing!</p>
<p>&rt;Oh no I have to cover my mouth and nose? Fine with me I am not out of shape or a little bitch</p>
<p>Hey, if you want to cover your face with a infants diaper or wear a gas mask, have it, just don't throw at me or bother me because I don't wear one.</p>
<p>&rt;Have I been forced to do anything else? Nope</p>
<p>If you live in the U.S. one way or the other YOU have been forced to do something whether you admit it or not.</p>
<p>&rt;Please tell me how your rights were violated by the government</p>
<p>Well, lets see now, just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't go to church</li>
<li>We are forced to close our businesses without compensation</li>
<li>I can't peaceably assemble with no more then 6 people</li>
<li>We are being forced to wear a medical device to conduct commerce and to travel</li>
<li>We are forced to have a curfew, so our right to travel is restricted</li>
</ul>
<p>Need more rights violated?</p>
<p>Do the "Reich" thing, report your grandmother to the authorities so she can be forcefully put into a elderly home so she can be inoculated against her will.</p>
