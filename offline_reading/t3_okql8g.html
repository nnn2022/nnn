    <strong>Thoughts on Atala Prism Vaccine Passports</strong>
    <p><p>This is a terrible idea, but here it goes.</p>
<p><a href="https://atalaprism.io/app">Atala Prism</a> is a decentralized identity management solution that runs on the <a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano platform</a>. Prism would enable Walgreens or CVS to grant you a vaccine credential that could be used anywhere. Since Prism is a decentralized application (DAP) that runs on Cardano, nobody can arbitrarily revoke your vaccine passport because they don't like you. Walgreens could revoke the credential they gave you to show that you were vaccinated, but nobody can stop you from accessing the decentralized ids (DIDs) that Prism stores on the Cardano blockchain. This means that nobody could ever shut you out of society just because they hated you, but the non-vaccinated would still be shut out of society.</p>
<p>This is a terrible idea, but I thought I'd start the discussion because the technology side of things deeply interests me. I also want people to understand what might be coming down the pipe.</p></p>

        <p>Don't have time rn to research if atala prism it's already part of goodhealthpass, but all the vax certificates will be bought up by this company <a href="https://www.GoodHealthPass.org">https://www.GoodHealthPass.org</a> - it's the Bill Gates and Rockeffeler's owned company.</p>
<p>As this wasn't "enough", goodhealthpass it's the child company of the <a href="https://id2020.org">id2020</a>company (global digital id).</p>
<p>Once you accept atala, you are one step closer to global digital goodhealthpass. </p>
<p>Once you reject atala, you are two stept further from the global digital beast.</p>
<p>Rights are not usually given back after they taken.</p>
