        <p>Infant/early childhood mortality in my family history actually dropped after the 1860s.  It wasn't the vaccines that did it, it was the better sanitization practices that came around after the Civil War, plus better nutrition.  In the 1820s, it was like 5 out of 6 children dying, by the 1870s they were all surviving to adulthood.  Just putting this out there since the Amish still live in a very similar way to 19th century people.</p>

        <p>People forget that in the grand scheme of human history, only very recently did we stop getting eaten by wild animals, succumbing to the elements, dying from broken limbs/wounds or starving to death on a regular basis. Widescale industrialization and sanitation changed everything. I'm not opposed to all vaccines (especially for rabies which is 100% fatal if untreated) but they aren't the panacea some people like to claim they are. Hygiene and good nutrition are.</p>

        <p>It also gave me bad side effects when I received one a few years ago following a dog bite. Intolerable pain, my arm was practically unusable for days and I couldn't sleep. Developed a rash and swelling and had to go on a course of steroids. Had a weird red area at the site of injection for a month after.</p>
<p>Considering the dog was all of 10lbs and barely broke the surface, I probably should've skipped it. Maybe it's necessary in high risk situations but I think it's overprescribed as are many things in western medicine.</p>

        <p>This is so true, hygiene and good nutrition. My one exception would be children, young children should be dirty while they are building up an immune system. Be a dirty child and a clean grown up. Good nutrition is a lifelong thing but sadly most people have terrible nutrition. What the health is a good documentary that highlights how government and corporations manipulate us into bad health and dietary habits.</p>

        <p>Everyone contributes the drop in death and disease to vaccines while ignoring everything you just mentioned. Nutrition is a big one as eating the proper amount gives you're body a stronger immune system and overall better ability to deal with problems. </p>
<p>If vaccines came around without the better nutrition or sanitization, I doubt you would have seen that much lower of a mortality rate.</p>

        <p>Not saying that vaccines did nothing (they did help with smallpox, etc), but if I were given a choice between eating processed garbage, not sleeping properly, not exercising but having access to vaccines OR proper nutrition, quality sleep, and being fit but not having access to vaccines, I'd take my chances with the latter.</p>

        <p>I've read something similar, it seems like the biggest jumps in life expectancy were correlated with the average person getting access to clean food/water supplies, indoor plumbing and so on.  In my family, in the US, it seemed like this happened by the 1920's or so.</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, antibiotics and vaccines for diseases that are actually serious played a role, too.  I just thought it was notable that my family records didn't line up at all with the mainstream narrative that children were dying left and right and people were deathly ill all the time until Big Pharma came along to save us.  In the best preserved part of my family history (which is VERY well-preserved), the reduced childhood mortality didn't line up with that narrative at all.    </p>
<p>I have an article about one of my ancestors who was born in the 1790s, and it describes how things were in the first half of the century:  "Six children came to bless his fireside and make home pleasant, one of whom, John G., lived to manhood, but he died in 1854 from the effects of an accidental injury; his wife soon followed him, leaving an only son, Edgar W.  Thus left an orphan, Edgar was the pride and the comfort of this childless couple; in him all their love was centered, and in his success in life they hoped to see their name live and be handed down to posterity.  His grandfather wishing him to receive a college education, sent him to Hamilton College; while there he contracted scarlet fever, and died very suddenly in his twenty-first year."  </p>
<p>That was in 1868.  Scarlet fever didn't become less of a problem because of vaccines, it was resolved through antibiotics and lifestyle factors (and even in the 20th century, medical professionals were recommending about 6 weeks of bed rest for children to recover from that).  I'm not talking about just using hand sanitizer when I say "better sanitization", I'm talking about major sweeping changes that resulted from the Industrial Revolution, germ theory, cleaner water, etc.  </p>
<p>After my great-great grandfather took Edgar's place as Daniel's heir, there were no more early deaths like that.  The children born in the last few decades of the 19th century lived well into the 20th century; their children lived into this century.  I think it had way more to do with nutrition and sanitation than just vaccines in the case of my great-grandparents' generation.  Sure, everyone was getting the smallpox vaccine, but I don't think it would have been nearly as effective without those other factors involved!  I think overwork and overly processed foods are the modern equivalent of difficult farming conditions and poor sanitation in pre-industrial times.  I was sick for 7 months before the scamdemic happened, and it was all due to lifestyle factors, not due to me needing more drugs or injections.</p>

        <p>Yup, worst prolonged period of illness in my life was caused by not being able to get time off work.  It lasted 7 months and was absolute hell.  It was right before the pandemic, which lead me to be a hardcore doomer at the beginning since I already felt like I was at death's door from so much illness and fatigue.  That spell of illness is a major reason why I refuse to move back to NYC.  I have no idea how many other people got infected, just know that I couldn't recover for SEVEN. FUCKING. MONTHS.  Due to the timing, I half joke that "I was patient zero in NYC".</p>

        <p>Thanks for checking in!  I'm definitely doing better now, although my old social life has pretty much fallen apart over disagreements about the vaccine/vaccine passport in NY.  Ugh.  The good news is that since my job is remote, I can look forward to moving somewhere like Florida at the beginning of next year, and it is encouraging that there's more events to go to now!  I hit up a historical re-enactment 2 weeks ago and an anime convention this past weekend.  The awesome thing is that Ohio fully re-opened just in time for Colossalcon, so I got a taste of what it's like to have full freedom, and it was AWESOME!  Knowing that things really are OK in the "free states" and I can just move is helpful.  Still feel bad about the number of old friendships that got ruined by this, but there's not a ton I can do about that until everything blows over.  Definitely glad I questioned everything, had the balls to break away from the groupthink, and found supportive people on here!</p>

<p>Exactly what you said. Polio happened because people were too clean. Polio was around whether or not people were 'too clean'. Polio became worse when we cleaned up our sanitation and water systems, but it has been around for 1,000's of years. Are you suggesting we shouldn't have cleaned up our sanitation and water systems?</p>

        <p>In your family? Anecdotes are irrelevant. The infant mortality rate started a long slide from 165 per 1,000 in 1900 to 7 per 1,000 in 1997. The infant mortality rate in 1850 was 212 per 1,000. Vaccines had an incredible affect on mortality rates, starting with the small pox vaccine had a 30% mortality rate.</p>

<p>Multiple studies in the context of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases have made a direct link between the low rate of reported vaccine coverage in Amish communities and their susceptibility to disease outbreaks. Outbreaks of rubella,3 measles,4 pertussis,5Haemophilus influenzae,6 and polio,7 as well as increased cases of childhood tetanus,8 have disproportionately affected Amish communities in the United States.</p>

        <p>The Rubella study is fascinating:</p>
<p>"In early 1991 a large rubella outbreak in a Tennessee Amish community <strong>that had experienced no rubella for 17 years</strong> afforded an opportunity to describe the epidemiology of rubella in this unique population.</p>
<p>"Of 383 persons in the sample 85 (22%) had rubella. <strong>Illnesses were mild</strong>; 16% of cases lacked fever and 20% of cases reported no symptoms except rash."</p>
<p>This serves as great argument <em>against</em> mass vaccination, not for it. What it is saying is that in 17 years, there were 85 cases of Rubella in a sample of 383 (so 22%), all of them mild.</p>
<p>The problem is that if you mass vaccinate this population, you have to be sure that </p>
<p>The last one is also interesting: "Partial sequencing of the virus capsid protein coding region (VP1) of the poliovirus genome at the MDH laboratory identified it as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV)"</p>

        <p>Vaccines are a medical tool, like bandages, scalpels, chemotherapy, and many others. It is good that we have them as an option, but that doesn't mean that they are good or useful in every situation. </p>
<p>Vaccine for polio or small pox? Sign me up. Vaccine for the flu that has decades of studies on long-term effects? Maybe I'll get it. Maybe not. Less-than-a-year-old vaccine with no long-term studies for a disease I have already had and literally didn't notice? No thank you.</p>

        <p>Not nearly as much as some people think. The cluster in their own towns, but they make a living by engaging in commerce with the rest of society. Even in big cities like Philadelphia, you can see Amish people operating Amish restaurants in Reading Terminal Market, which is one of the biggest and most active markets in the country.</p>

        <p>Your are an uninformed idiot. Amish communities who are some of the most skeptical of the medical field, made the independent decision to restrict large gatherings including Easter services(almost unheard of, it’s a deeply religious community). They also suffered from the transmissibility of covid pretty bad. Also worth mentioning is that within the medical community they are categorized by their high frequency of genetic diseases. So yes, they are impacted by bacteria and viruses, maybe less so because they are isolated from the us population. Unlike the us population it’s worth noting that the Amish don’t really head out to China too often either.</p>

You are debunked, this is not the plague. Your numbers are inflated to scare people in submission for the corona measurements which is proven over and over again, just like your stupid little mask that does not do shit other then remind people of this "super deadly virus", so deadlyyou have to test for it to know if you have it.</p>

        <p>Don't talk about the Amish they sacrifice and humble themselves everyday for life pretty much.  They isolate from society which greatly reduces their risk of exposure  etc but that's not my point.</p>
<p>They live without power, internet, modern amenities, share outhouses, make their own cloths don't use cars, go without medical care,  aren't materialistic, pretty much don't shower or bathe often from my experience and get shunned by their society for acting out</p>

        <p>It's still the choice of the individual to be a part of that insular community or not.  Just like it's their family's choice to break of contact or not.  My point is people are being forced to wear masks, stay shut in, pressure to become a lab rat under coercion and threat.</p>

        <p>So in one situation it’s still a “choice” even if there are substantial personal and economic consequences for making that choice, but in the other your freedom is being taken away? No one is coming to your home and forcing you to wear a mask or get vaccinated. But their are consequences for making the choice not to.</p>

<p>I've seen videos in non-US countries of police forcibly putting masks on people.  There's stories of people being arrested for not submitting the names of people they've been in contact with or trying to quarantine in home instead of an approved hotel.</p>
<p>There are consequences for leaving the Amish community.  None of which involve coercion into becoming a lab rat.  None of which involve not being able to function in the world as a whole.</p>

        <p>I don’t think our Amish metaphor is serving a purpose anymore and we’ve probably drawn it out too far (natural since it was the OP). We can find common ground in that I don’t believe it’s right to physically force masks on people and outdoor public spaces shouldn’t have a mask mandate. Also some countries had absurd quarantine policies that went too far, but it’s not an all or nothing thing. There are nuances. You have the right to not wear a mask or be vaccinated and venues/private business have the right to not allow you to enter based on those choices.</p>

        <p>Being told you can't work or purchase food without a mask, while simultaneously making it illegal/inaccessible to live off the land is coercion, yes. Being excommunicated from a religion does not hinder your ability to work or eat or be housed, so that is NOT coercion.</p>

        <p>Ugh I did not want to continue the Amish metaphor but since you brought it up again: being raised in a religious community that does not provide you with the tools to exist outside of that community (lower high school graduation rates, not being exposed to culture outside of your community, etc) and then being excommunicated from that community does hinder your ability to get work and therefore eat and attain housing. I agree with you that people should be able to live off the land and restrictions on gardening/buying directly from farmers are bad. But as far as purchasing food the options are: people who are at higher risk being able to purchase food at all OR people having to masks while in a public space. I understand this sub believes there are risks associated with wearing masks and I think those concerns should be taken seriously, but there are no perfect solutions and most people trying to enforce mask mandates are simply trying to protect immune compromised communities and not trying to force people to wear “cheese cloth” as some weird power move.</p>

I agree that I don’t want to live in a society like the Amish, people who seem to share your beliefs are the ones who keep insisting on the Amish metaphor. Also how are you being denied access to food? By being asked to wear a mask in public spaces? Is any barrier to entering a grocery store the “government not allowing access to food”?</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? I’m not aware of any countries that force you to wear masks in your home. Is this what this whole sub is about? Are you guys under the impression that you were supposed to be wearing masks at home at all times? You’re right that is outrageous! Take off your mask right now you totally misunderstood the law. But if you choose to leave your home and enter the public space you should wear a mask. If you don’t in almost all jurisdictions you still won’t be given a ticket, but it’s a nice thing to do for your fellow man. Maybe try going outside before you try to tell me what reality is like.</p>

        <p>&rt;  But if you choose to leave your home and enter the public space you should wear a mask. </p>
<p>No, I shouldn't. And now that the law reflects this, I don't and won't.</p>
<p>&rt; Are you guys under the impression that you were supposed to be wearing masks at home at all times? </p>
<p>A number of jurisdictions did in fact insist on this if you had any visitors in your home. Obviously the capacity to enforce this is limited, but there is video of police breaking up small home gatherings across Canada.</p>

        <p>You’re right, thanks to the people who actually got vaccinated it is now okay to not wear a mask in many places so what are you guys so mad about still? If you’re still mad about when we had to wear masks then my point still stands; it’s part of your social contract to make small sacrifices on behalf of your fellow citizens. You are all incredibly unpatriotic if you disagree with that premise. I agree with you that sending police to homes to break up small gatherings should not have been done and I’m for prosecuting law enforcement that abuse their power. Honestly if you guys are right and this vaccine kills everyone in 30 years I’ll be happy I got one rather than live in a world solely inhabited by members of this sub.</p>

        <p>&rt; it’s part of your social contract to make small sacrifices on behalf of your fellow citizens.</p>
<p>Stealing over a year from society, wiping out countless small businesses with closure rules, and depriving children of an education is not a small sacrifice. So even if you are correct about masks, reducing our gripes to mandatory masking misses 99% of the point. </p>
<p>&rt; You are all incredibly unpatriotic if you disagree with that premise. </p>
<p>Ask me how much I care about patriotism rhetoric from leftists, given their demonstrated hostility towards this country and those of us on the political right.</p>
<p>&rt; Honestly if you guys are right and this vaccine kills everyone in 30 years </p>
<p>Are you even capable of having a good faith discussion? Noting that we don't yet know the long term risks of an unproven vaccine is not the same as contending that it is going to kill everybody who takes it. Certainly if I believed that, I wouldn't have gotten vaccinated, which I did. But my choice to vaccinate was based on my personal risk profile, not a belief that that vaccine is essential for all.</p>

        <p>We were specifically talking about mask mandates. Saying “even if you are right about the thing we’re talking about, what about these totally separate issues” is not having a good faith argument, which has happened multiple times during this thread and why I’m allowed to also take minor jabs. We agree about schools and small businesses though. I think small businesses should have been kept afloat and provided more aid to reopen safely. Schools should have remained open, but in a perfect world schools wouldn’t have been unfunded for decades and would have already been better equipped for online learning. “Stealing a year” is something I can’t understand. What have you been doing this whole time? Is your life defined by going to restaurants and concerts? Do you know how much people even 50 years ago would have loved to chill in your modern home for a year? I understand it was a tough year but if you own a car and have internet they didn’t “steal a year” from you. You may have lost a year, but that was your choice.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem that we do. I opposed mandatory closures and related regulatory burdens. At no point do I think financial aid was the proper course.</p>
<p>&rt; You may have lost a year, but that was your choice.</p>
<p>It wasn't my choice, because assholes like you empowered the government to run roughshod over my rights.</p>

        <p>Do you even know any actual Amish, dude? That was rhetorical, I know you don't. They actually <em>don't</em> isolate themselves from society at all, and depending on the region, they are primarily business owners because they've run out of farm land. They do <em>all kinds</em> of work for "the English" and you'll see them at stores and out in the community all the damn time. It's me that you watched a documentary once, but you have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
