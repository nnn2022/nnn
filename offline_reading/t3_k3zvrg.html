    <strong>Why does the average internet dweller see zero issues with a few hundred billionaires controlling the entire planet and all of our lives?</strong>
    <p><p>I mean what the fuck? This is a mindset that I can't even begin to comprehend. It's one thing to feel like you're powerless against this system, but it's something completely different to welcome our dehumanizing future with open arms -- and it seems like most social media types actively endorse it.</p></p>

        <p>Because they were already living alone inside believing whatever was fed to them online. Life hasn't changed much for them, they have zero perspective on the outside world or what life is like offline, and they are so addicted to online approval they wouldn't post about thier objections even if they have them.</p>

        <p>I still don’t understand why people are so obsessed with hating Trump. I can understand disagreeing with his policies or being put off by his personality (valid criticisms of any politician), but the people who act like he’s literally Hitler and the greatest threat ever to democracy are just delusional.</p>

        <p>Because something has gone very very wrong in the West culturally, intellectually, morally, ideologically, philosophically, politically, etc. for decades and we are just now realizing the full extent of the psychological damage/brainwashing. The greatest generation wouldn't have accepted this so something (I have a few ideas what) has poisoned the West in the intervening years. Sounds dramatic but not sure what other conclusion to draw at this point</p>

        <p>Yeah so I think those play a part but I feel like it still doesn't fully explain why these avenues are being used to push the agenda and where the ideological underpinnings/motive came from in the first place. </p>
<p>I think it's essentially (but not entirely) due to a collapse of religion. I was raised pretty traditionally catholic but don't practice now and wouldn't consider myself religious but I'm beginning to think more and more that Judeo-Christian values are necessary at least in a "if God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him" Voltarian way.  I took a really interesting year long political philosophy course in college (from a professor who hadn't yet been ideologically ruined yet), and I just don't see a way out for the West if we try to rely on science and expertise as the primary paths to achieve the ultimate good of communal aims/subservience to the collective in place of a recognition of individual moral purpose/salvation (which is a fundamental tenant of Judeo-Christian values despite what some Jesuit religious leaders in Rome might say to the contrary..). </p>
<p>It just appears too hard for humans to establish any type of meaning that resonates outside of religious purpose/meaning so we look to (i) the state - resulting in first the French Revolution and then the horrors of the 20th century manifested by collectivist ideologies (communism and fascism) in societies in which the individual was subsumed to the collective as a means of attaining purpose/meaning or (ii) completely inward and live our lives with the chief aim of avoiding plain and attaining pleasure (which I think nearly always collapses in on itself and leads us to (i)). I think in the West we were turned off by collective ideologies for a while after WWII so we turned to other ways to make our lives meaningful - legitimate movements for civil rights later coopted by identity politics and "justice" movements with no clear purpose/end except to fight existing power structures, pure egoism/belief in human capacity/zealous faith in "science", essential oils (lol), etc. Then, when these things are used as a means to establish meaning, they take on a religious aspect and people who disagree with you are heretics (I think this roughly accounts for the rise of the tolerant, intolerant left). Now (I say "now" but I'm not entirely sure this ideological undercurrent was actually squashed in the West and I think it's been festering for 50 years or more), there seems to be again an explicit push for collectivism/meaning as a political entity as part of the collective which is ruled by pure majoritarian democracy and from which you derive all your rights (and which can be taken away by majority rule at any time if it suits the collective will).  Once people see themselves as mere extensions of the collective/state, they hand over power to people in charge because they are convinced the state can save them/keep them safe/provide a safety net/keep the comfortable/whatever. I think because of this lack of meaning and individual purpose, people see themselves so much less as autonomous human beings with natural rights and just members of a group who should act in concert according to the dictates of the state (which currently takes the form of a technocracy (e.g., Fauci, whoever the hell the climate scientists are, John Brennan, etc.)). People don't think they have any purpose or meaning as an individual and wouldn't really think it was worth pursuing if they thought that was even a possibility (much easier to just do what you and everyone else around you are being told to do). </p>
<p>It would take me hours to fully type out my thoughts but that's a (Very) rough summary of what I think went wrong. Essentially, religious and reason were the twin pillars holding up the West (based more on American enlightenment values than European ones - i.e., more religious than the French  Rousseau  or Hobbes) and then religion collapsed. This hole was filled by all kinds of terrible attempts at reorienting human meaning/purpose until we've been left with full and complete subjectivism (purpose/meaning is whatever Fauci tells you it is - don't kill Grandmas, for example) combined with a collectivist push which necessarily entails stronger governments. So, meaning is dictated by a strong government and that meaning is whatever the government says it is. [As an aside, one impediment to ramming your own version of meaning down someone's throat is their ties to their family and religion, both of which have been ceaselessly attacked over the last 50 years. For the people who didn't abandon religion and for the people who still believe in getting married and having a few kids, society has attempted to undermine them at every turn (at least culturally at this point and we're starting to see it more socially and politically).]</p>
<p>Finally, people in power have realized the opportunity that this gives them to further amalgamate power - if you have people in the headspace described above, you can completely control them. People fell into this intellectual trap over decades, then power hungry politicians and leaders of int'l institutions consciously or subconsciously capitalized on it and pushed these developments further to take advantage and gain power. I also honestly don't know how much I think these changes have been purposefully pushed on the West as it seems like people have been concertedly undermining American values for at least 50 years (Saul Alinsky comes to mind). BUT, they would not have been successful if Americans in large part still maintained the values they did 70 or 80 years ago. </p>
<p>To your point about the media, educational institutions, etc., I think these are just tools in the ideological/intellectual transformation - some of them used on purpose to indoctrinate and some of them used by well-meaning people who think that racial justice and demolition of all power relationships, for example, is what gives people meaning and what they should relentlessly work toward. </p>
<p>Oh. And the CCP is DEFINITELY involved idk how exactly lol but they doin' somethin to push this. </p>

        <p>They are stuck in a perpetual state of mental adolescence.  They crave micromanagement and coddling, because between helicopter parents and pushover school administrators, it's all they've ever known and the idea of being independent (financially, socially, mentally) terrifies them.  If mommy and daddy aren't there to wipe their asses, help them pull up their pants, and tell them what to feel and think, they'll settle for the next best thing - which, in this case, is government and news media.</p>

        <p>Yep. Human beings are followers by nature, most people don’t know what to think because they are totally bombarded with so much conflicting news they don’t know wether they are coming or going. I believe it’s called the Alice in wonderland effect.</p>
<p>The elites know this and know that people will fall prey to the loudest and most aggressive person because we’ve been literally trained to be passive. That’s why shilling is so effective, people will just tend to fall in line with the status quo. It’s also why if you stand up and not wear your mask, you will see other people take it off.</p>

        <p>These aren't just average internet dwellers. I live on the west coast in Canada and it appears the majority of the population has subscribed to this madness.</p>
<p>I would say that we have 30% the vocal majority for masks and lockdowns and anyone who doesn't agree is a murderer, 15% of the population are enraged with the situation, and 65% falls in between.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since we have an obvious bias towards the madness and incentive for most governments, media, billionaires, which also help inflate the former, it is obvious how this will play out.</p>

        <p>Personally I believe the stats coming from hospitals that ICU beds are nearing capacity. There is merit to flattening the curve and I'm willing to bear a few inconveniences this year like skipping Thanksgiving with the family or ordering take out instead of dining in the restaurant. Doesn't really bother me.</p>

        <p>Stop for a moment and think about why they’re billionaires. They made all that money because they invented a service or product that people want to pay for. They don’t sit around in circles plotting how to control the world, they sit around in circles plotting how to invent something else that you want to buy. Knowing your purchasing habits (Amazon) and preferences for electric cars (Tesla) are what they care about, not “controlling” the damn planet</p>
<p>Society only gives them that control when it decides it cannot live without their products. If the world suddenly decided it didn’t care about electric cars, Elon Musk is no longer a billionaire. </p>
<p>Stop vilifying the fact that the consumer gives billionaires their power, not some arbitrary selection system or the state</p>

        <p>When you have everything and can buy anything you look for satisfaction in other ways. Mainly power. Mix this with an idea that you are better then the common man and therefore know what's best for them helps. I mean bill gates could end qorld hunger today but chooses instead to focus on a totalitarian technological utopia because he knows what's best for everyone.</p>

        <p>Do you actually think that?</p>
<p>Many billionaires and most powerful people on the planet are not inventors and only inherited their wealth. </p>
<p>You're acting as if all people actually would form their own opinion on something and decide whether they need it or not. There's no need for most products, so it has been artificially created. The majority of people is merely brainwashed consumers. Apart from that "controlling the world" is very much in their interest. Mass surveillance, vaccine pass, digital ID, digital money, 5G etc. are all being implemented not for the sake of people but to have more insight on people and to force them to act in line with the way these billionaires want it. And just look at the media which brainwashes people into thinking those things are good or acceptable.</p>
<p>If you'd actually care to inform yourself on things like the Great Reset and the plans these elites have for the next 10 years (which they even state publicly), you'd speak differently.</p>

        <p>For one, it's a histrionic statement to say that billionaires "control" people.  They don't.  I assume you're pro-socialism, or at least you sound like the type.  Under socialism, a group of people most definitely DOES control your life and limit your freedom.  So would you want to trade one perceived master for a very definite master?</p>

        <p>id rather live in a world full of anti oligarch hysteria than live in a world where most people blindly obey oligarchs</p>
<p>i would prefer to live in a world free from hysteria. but if i had to choose between living in a world full of anti oligarch &amp; anti state hysteria OR  living in a world full of assholes that blindly obey oligarchs and the state, i would choose the first choice. better to blindly hate assholes in power than to blindly obey them</p>
<p>this world has gone way too far down the path of blind obedience to authority, and history has shown us that this will lead to heinous authority perpetrated crimes against humanity</p>
<p>i dont know what a hysterical anti oligarch society would look like. and neither do i know what society would look like if the majority of its inhabitants blindly hated and disobeyed the state and its oligarch owners. but i am certain that blind obedience to authority leads to authority led atrocities, and i really, really would like to avoid that</p>
