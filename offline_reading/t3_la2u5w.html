    <strong>Use the stock market GameStop scandal that is happening right now to educate as many people as you can on media manipulation.</strong>
    <p><p>If you’re not familiar, it’s a whole big mess but it has exposed the fraud that goes on with Wall Street investors, the media and their government stooges. And now, just this weekend and today, there is a coordinated global media blitz to spread disinformation about the redditors involved and their stock plays in order to save their wealthy buddies. It’s blatant and frankly hysterical. </p>
<p>BUT, it should be pointed out in every way imaginable to as many people as possible; if they can coordinate a global media campaign in the name of saving themselves billions of dollars over a weekend, they damn sure can coordinate disinformation for a year of lockdowns in order to make trillions. </p>
<p>Make sure you and everyone you know understands what is happening. You can see it in real time if you watch the financial news today.</p>
<p>Edit: here’s Jim Cramer explaining the process. They’re all crooks. </p>

        <p>I really don't see this as a fuck-up by Wall Street investors. I really don't. In fact, the media is telling people to participate and buy shares. <strong>THAT</strong> is a red flag because the media would be telling people to shy away from it, unless there was a reason they wanted this to happen. I think they are looking to crash the market with this situation, and it's a part of the "Great Reset". Once they crash the stock market, they will use that  as another reason to do away with our current monetary system.</p>

        <p>But of course, the morons here and all over Reddit are celebrating this shit. Just like with the Capitol protests, which are also very convenient in their timing. Every time this shit happens, it comes with dire consequences that end up fucking us over. Again, what a coinky-dink.</p>

        <p>It’s a war between hedge funds and you can see which media outlets are in whose pockets. Those that are saying to buy in are trying to cannibalize those that got caught in the short sale; it’s a pretty fascinating process. But I don’t think this was part of the Great Reset... it could be though. I assume that will come with a “Digital Dollar” (crypto style currency) that will be tied to your obedience to the health care initiatives and eventually a Social Credit Score, a la China. </p>
<p>I think what’s happening today is a bunch of billionaires got caught with their pants down, they’re trying to cover their asses and other billionaires are trying to finish them off. Those hedge funds will destroy each other in a second if they get the chance. There is plenty of media posting the other way, super-wealthy crying on tv, etc. </p>
<p>It’s fascinating.</p>

        <p>It’s highly likely. With no increased regulation on institutional investors. Which would just go to confirm what we already know.</p>

        <p>It most certainly will.  And what regulation doesn’t cover, business practices will seek to gain from.  Individuals like us will always be at a disadvantage.  We simply cannot afford the resources or legal protection that a large Wall Street market maker can.  </p>
<p>You start with one hand tied behind your back, when it comes to this stuff.  Tread very carefully.</p>

        <p>From where I stand, GameStop is a relatively wholesome company that enables poor people to buy good older games and consoles for cheap in an era with increasing push toward digital-only cloud gaming that can be used to punish government/corporate dissenters by locking them out of their digital game library for committing wrongthink. And they took a small stand against closing their doors for PuBLiC sAfEtY back in March last year. Similar to Hobby Lobby, which is another company that gets a lot of shit while Walmart, Target, and Amazon are hErOeS. Disclaimer: at least 50% of my shopping is at Walmart, and 50% of my online shopping is Amazon. Most of their competition is dead or too expensive lol</p>

        <p>I was really happy GameStop took a stand in March and later in the year went to my local one to see if I could find any affordable old games.</p>
<p>Walked in, told we have to have a mask... So we walked out. Super disappointed in my local chain 😭</p>

        <p>Meh, mask mandates are the least of my concerns compared to mandatory vaccination, mass testing, contact tracing, and digital everything. That's why our naysayers focus primarily on the anti-mask rhetoric, because they see how increased surveillance and a rushed vaccine might genuinely warrant more skepticism than a piece of cloth. So they'd rather dodge the tough topics and focus their attention on what are arguably our most minor concerns. Which, in return, pushes us to focus our own time and energy on mask mandates instead of the more draconian measures, similar to how so many people who don't really support Trump find themselves defending him anyway in retaliation against his often deranged naysayers.</p>
