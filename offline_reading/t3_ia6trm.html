    <strong>A welcome return to some normality</strong>

<p>I am watching this and smiling, a major event that has people in it and I can't see too many masks around the auditorium, also the commentator just said let's hope this paves the way for some more normality to return, like theatres and other sports events...</p>
<p>Bring it on!  It has been rubbish watching events with canned/fake applause....</p></p>

        <p>Now let people back to every other types of sports. I missed chants and taunts watching football, itâ€™s still fun to watch but not the same.</p>

        <p>Movement towards a return to normality is great, tho judging by the thumbnail it still looks like a circus. As in 'bread and circuses' and actual clowns.</p>

        <p>They got screwed over by the government backtracking on its pilot events plans a month ago just as the tournament was about to begin.</p>
<p>It still seems very subdued given that it is the final of the biggest snooker event of the year and tickets go on sale a year in advance with every session sold out. Usually there is a big 'come on Ronnie!' crowd whenever Ronnie is playing but the few that seem to be in the audience seem a bit embarassed when they have shouted so far.</p>
<p>Masks are not required when seated but required everywhere else in the venue. They seem to be letting people out of the auditorium between seems/during the interval which seems to be different to the plans in other places like Germany.</p>
<p>Germany has orchestra concerts starting soon with socially distanced audiences. You won't get to buy tickets for individual seats, you will have to buy tickets for seating blocks instead and will be directed to your seats based on when you arrive. Concerts will be shorter than norma (1 hour or so) with no interval. Masks will not be required when seated but will be required when moving around the venue.</p>
<p>There is an athletics event going on in Monaco with socially distanced spectators seating in bubbles although mask use seems to be compulsory there.</p>
<p>Still it's better than the piped-in crowd noise they have had in the earlier rounds. It's a start.</p>
