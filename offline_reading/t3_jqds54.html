    <strong>Avoiding a contact trace. (Europe)</strong>
    <p><p>Currently in Portugal where they ramp up the stupidity. Anybody who knows the country should know they are worse than Nazi Germany when it comes to taking it up the ass from authority voluntarily. Came down with corona myself but just been chillin at home. I don't want to give my data to anyone or do a retarded test. I refuse to partake in this Satanist shit.</p>
<p>Obviously I must have gotten it from somewhere. One chick that hung out with our group got her positive test back today after getting tested without having typical covid symptoms (mistake number one). She now makes a list of almost 100(!) people for the authority to contact trace since October 30th. During that period I only met the girl once very briefly and outdoors. Didn't even really talk to her or went near her. These people are more than enough to change the level of restrictions up multiple levels by the way and warrant a lockdown for the whole municipality. lol.</p>
<p>I don't want to get sucked into this sick demonic Matrix. My idea was to tell them I'm not in the country anymore should they call (got a foreign number). Nobody of those folks got my address anyway. </p>
<p>this is how they make you part of this sick system against your will. We should maybe have a flair for this sort of stuff too, this is how you resist.</p></p>

        <p>This is why I absolutely do not give out my phone number or address to businesses for "contact tracing" purposes, why my Bluetooth is turned off and the phone left at home or in my car as much as possible, and why I give out false information if absolutely forced to provide any.</p>
<p>This is what I recommend you do as well. And encourage friends, family, and co-workers to do the same. If the contact tracing system is flooded with false information, it will collapse.</p>
<p>Oh... and invest in a Faraday case for your mobile phone.</p>

        <p>I've tried to frame this to others as a violation of my right to personal and medical privacy, as follows.</p>
<p>By ratting someone out to a contact tracer, you are unilaterally sentencing them to be imprisoned in their home for self-isolation while awaiting test results, or for 14 days quarantine if they test positive. And they are now in a contact tracing database without ever having consented to being there.</p>
<p>If that person is rendered incapable of earning a wage in that period, are you going to pay their bills for them? Are you going to explain to their creditors why the checks are bouncing?</p>
<p>It's typical virtue-signaller behaviour - <em>you</em> "feel good" about "protecting others", with no thought of the effects your actions <em>actually have</em> on others.</p>

        <p>From my experience, most people don't give a fuck about medical freedom or personal privacy. Theirs or others. As for finances, the COVID hysterics would probably handwave it because most are wealthy or on welfare. They don't really understand the need for money because they have plenty of it OR it gets handed to them.</p>

        <p>this is going to sound like a stupid American answer but i would say just don't answer the phone if you don't recognize the number. if it goes to voicemail, erase it. </p>
<p>i'll tack on to what people have said below, but don't give out your real contact information to restaurants and shops. pay in cash only so they can't trace your credit card.</p>
<p>turn off your bluetooth and your wifi when you're not at home. only turn on your location services when you absolutely positively need them.</p>
<p>maybe these people aren't really your friends if they are willing to give you away so easily. maybe it's for the best that you learn that now. </p>
<p>i'm sorry they sucked you into this.</p>

        <p>Might not be best practice to leave your phone at home if you have dependents, at least not in this day and age. And are home addresses not on public record? Do your social contacts not know where you live? Or do you just trust them not to snitch?</p>

        <p>at the risk of sounding glib... how did we parent in the time before cell phones? it's not impossible.</p>
<p>for example, my mobile phone is turned off and locked up in a security vestibule during the day. if someone needs to reach me, i'm available by my desk phone, or i will return their call as soon as possible.</p>
<p>in the U.S., most addresses are not considered public record - i can't speak for the rest of North America or Europe.</p>
<p>as for my address? sure, my friends know where i live. however, do you think that they have my address on their person at all times? who keeps a proper address book anymore? hell, we're lucky if our friends save our addresses in our contact card on their phones. how many times will they ask you, "oooh, can you text me your address again?" yeah. i'm not too worried about anyone under the age of 50 actually have my address on hand at any given time, lol.</p>

        <p>Parenting a child is a bit different than caring for an irresponsible elder. My mother-in-law shouldn't really be doing certain things unsupervised, so my husband and I would rather get a text like "hey I'll be cooking while you're gone" so we can hurry home BEFORE it becomes an emergency.</p>

        <p>Yup! When asked (usually at stores) for my phone number, I give them an old number I had about 20 years ago. Name? Give them a fake one.  Email? I tell them I don't have one.  I only give truthful info when I am ordering something to be delivered.</p>
