        <p>Everyone’s always so quick to say you’re a killer, you have blood on your hands etc if you don’t wear a mask. But I believe these tyrants,pro-lockdowners, lying doctors and politicians have blood on their hands for all the suicides due to lockdowns, lost jobs, abuse etc.</p>

        <p>I’ll go as far as to say epidemiologists shouldn’t have a platform. At least not how they do now.</p>
<p>Hear me out. It’s not that they can’t say what they want to say, but the way they’ve been given prescience and elevated to a godlike unquestionable status within society and by the media is nauseating.</p>
<p>You want to have a epidemiologist on your panel? Cool. Also have an economist and a sociologist on there too, and for fucks sake maybe regular people too. </p>
<p>God didn’t come down and personally declare epidemiologists the sole arbiters of truth. We need to stop acting like it.</p>

        <p>What do you want me to get, a fucking degree in absolute bullshit?</p>
<p>Once you stop listening to political scientists like Fauci and start listening to actual scientists like, Dr Mike Yeadon, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Dr. Sunetra Gupta, among others who have no need to lie and what they say makes total sense compared to the horseshit they are trying to feed us, then the current <em>official narrative</em> fails apart pretty quickly</p>

        <p>It’s interesting that you say this. I’m a professional musician (classical, and thankfully it’s not my only job) and I don’t know what to think. 95% of my colleagues are not only on the left, but very authoritarian left, and very outspoken at that. While they always talk about wanting to get back to performing, they vote for and praise the kind of people that want to keep us locked down indefinitely. It makes me think we keep shooting ourselves in our own foot over and over and we’ll never get out.</p>

        <p>I truly don't understand it.  They should understand better than anyone that online interactions and zoom "events" (ha) don't take the place of in-person interaction and live shows!  My mom is a classical pianist, and she's been upset that her usual venue isn't lifting restrictions this summer.  It's truly not the same without people gathering around the piano and having more intimate social interactions.  The authoritarian left mentality disgusts me; it's destroying entire careers and businesses, not to mention doing intangible but deep damage to our very souls.</p>

        <p>The only reason I won't kill myself right now is because they want me to but trust me I've thought about it. I have figured out that pretty much every feeling of demoralization and depression and hopelessness I am feeling is exactly what they want me to feel. Same thing with racism. The way they are trying to make us hate one another? I refuse to do any of these things because I know this is what they want from me.</p>

        <p>Of course it is not that simplistic  ...it is part of a larger agenda...destabilizing the population, the military calls this “tenderizing” a population to exhaust and confuse people leaving them so worried about day to day survival they cannot organize against all of this or really absorb what’s happening. You are not thinking broadly. It’s part of something larger. This behavior against the population is an actual strategy that has been used before during the implementation of communistic governments. Sure it sounds like there is no way it’s true, people in this country think there is no way it could be happening here but if you really research this what is happening it is exactly that. I thought it was outlandish too but I don’t anymore at this stage.</p>

        <p>This is a global phenomenon... A transfer of wealth and power and some dramatic changes that will happen quickly as we go along further in this. All of the events of the past year are connected... The race riots, the disease etc. The disease has been an opportunity for governments to impose control in a way we've never experienced before. They used it to suspend our rights. The riots? If we hate one another and are distracted by that we are not able to focus on what is really happening. </p>
<p>And relaxed restrictions? No. The new "variants" in the news worldwide are an excuse to impose restrictions again.  Give us the feeling we are going back to Normal life to keep us quiet and calm us down and then take it away again. We are not going to have normal life again unless we fight for it. The government doest take away rights and just give them back. I spoke to a 99 year old person and someone in her late 80s recently and asked them how they felt about all of this and both said this is the darkest time in their lifetimes. It's worse than war time and other times of disease because of how the government is preventing people from seeing loved ones and keeping us isolated. Both said the media control is very concerning too. Even they said to me there is much more here than people are seeing on the surface. This is going to become increasingly oppressive. I hate to be negative because I am not negative by nature but it doesn't look good at all.</p>

        <p>I’m not convinced man. These kind of vague allegations of shadowy subterfuge have been around since always. Frankly, I don’t think the governments of the world are capable of pulling off what you’re describing. I think it’s much more mundane than all that. I also can’t really say much changed in my life due to covid. Basically I just haven’t been to the theaters or concerts, but my job and personal life has hardly been altered. I just don’t see any significant infringement on my rights. I do see private businesses having rules tho.</p>

I know people who have been assaulted. Never in all my years have I seen it like this. It’s at the point where I feel like I need a means of self defense for whatever I may run into out there. I am living a day to day existence wondering what’s coming next. It has been truly debilitating in a way I cannot even describe. I honestly felt like you too in the past , I seriously hope you are right and I am wrong. I want you to be right and me to be an insane tin foil hat person because that’s what all of this feels like. Let’s hope this isn’t what it seems ...</p>

        <p>I'd be curious to see the numbers for depression and suicide during the covid era. Obviously the virus affects some more than others but I'm more concerned with that than getting a cold for a few days.</p>

        <p>If he was claiming to be innocent sure. However, when you openly broadcast a video confession bragging about what you did and why you did it and your intent to keep doing it, I think it's fair to move straight to the sentencing phase.</p>
<p>That's basically how it works with a guilty plea, and I am pretty sure that all of that amounts to a guilty plea</p>

        <p>I'm not sure that "confession" would carry any weight, in any case, I don't want to boot the guys arse, I would want to treat him as I would any human, and hope for all hell for him to implicate his accomplices. something, I think a boot kicking would not help with, but a fair trail would.

        <p>I'm new here and not wanting to start an argument. I have heard people wanting faucci arrested, etc. Most sounds like rhetoric.  What would he be charged with and based on what evidence? Just very curious as I cant seem to find any straight answers for this.  Thank you for any insight</p>

        <p>He REALLY does.  The quote that really sealed the deal for me related to questions around him staying if Biden won.</p>
<p>He said something like:
“You couldn’t drag me away.  This is my moment, this is my time.  I’m here till the end.”</p>
<p>It’s not a direct quote but it wasn’t far from this.</p>

        <p>So it's extra funny/ironic we are talking about accents.  I think we all just get annoyed by any accent coming from someone we don't like.  I like to think that I don't have an accent that I don't have an accent, being from California but somebody recently described it as "valley girl" so that ran deep, lol.</p>

        <p>Yes. However FaucI is a good barometer of stupidity bc if you believe him after all the lies and backtracking, that’s undeniable proof of your idiocy. When people are like “but he‘s the leader of epidemiology in the US,” I just think “so what. It’s not like the US government has ever done anything to prove they’re above suspicion of either nefarious activity or incompetence.”</p>

<p>I have no issues with people discussing different scientific theories, censorship is what we should all fight against.</p>
<p>It's not fauci's fault the government is authoritarian. Even if his theories are dead wrong, he's not the one who closed down the world, it was the politicians who did that.</p>

        <p>Everyone who praises Fauci should look up interviews with Kary Mullis (inventor of the PCR and Nobel Laureate)....you will soon realize that had Miullis not been taken out right before Event 201, we would not be in this lockdown "masked up" mess.   He called out Fauci for the fraud he is back during the AIDS/HIV scare and his words still ring true.</p>

        <p>It's mindblowing that he is still around after admitting to lying to the entire public. He told us masks weren't helpful. He told us they offered a false sense of security. He told us they could do more harm than good. </p>
<p>Then he said the opposite, and people just eat it up without any questions. It's like a lot of people don't even remember. Really amazing to watch happen in real time. Now we are moving to triple masks and no one bats an eye.</p>

        <p>I’m convinced the CCP working with others inside our own government,installed Fauci to get to Trump and try to help make sure Joe Biden’s dementia got installed as President. It’s just too perfect how Biden and Fauci fawn all over each other constantly. Even when Biden openly contradicts Fauci on live TV (telling a little girl kids don’t contract or transmit COVID), still no peep from Fauci. Remember how he constantly undermined Trump?
He’s just a political tool, nothing more. All of our institutions are politicized now. We really can’t trust any of them anymore.</p>

        <p>My comment was harsh, mah bad. My issue is people flocking to fauci taking every word as truth when the man doesn’t produce all the facts, (i.e. lockdown regulations causing suicide rate to skyrocket) plus the dude, as accomplished as he is, did fuck up the aids/hiv response in the past. It’s the blind faith and hive mindedness that kills me dawg.</p>

        <p>Cancel culture is when you ruin someone's life for having a different opinion, or doing/saying dumb **** in the past. Not when you've basically put all of America on house arrest for a fake pandemic over a whole year.</p>
