    <strong>I don't want doomers snitching on people for having parties ever again.</strong>
    <p><p>So, with the recent mass Biden celebrations in huge gatherings, I feel that for doomers who attended those, they should no longer snitch on others for parties/large gatherings again. This is basically deja vu with the BLM protests/riots.</p>
<p>On another note, I often hear doomers complaining about the virus being politicized. In a way I think they're actually doing that very thing. If you gather en masse for protesting racism, rioting, or by celebrating Trump's demise/Biden's victory, it's acceptable but anything else is apparently selfish. Trump rallies were labeled as superspreader events. I think that's also politicizing IMO.</p></p>
