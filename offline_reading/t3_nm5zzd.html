    <strong>Hostility towards fun</strong>
    <p><p>This is something I have observed consistently over the last year and frequently without even any of the fake safety justification that gets peddled. Just a general negative attitude towards people unnecessarily being out and about, even when and where there are no lockdowns or hysteria over “cases”.</p>
<p>It seems to me a lot of this envy and general hostility towards others enjoying themselves in non productive, social ways already existed. Similar attitudes have been there historically. Usually directed at those not yet stuck in the rat race like teenagers ‘loitering’, but not as pervasive as today. I think it is far worse now with how much time people spend with screens, both because they aren’t living active social lives and because they are building artificial levels of envy due to following the curated stories on social media. </p>
<p>Basically I believe these lockdowns weren’t only made acceptable because modern tech gives people entertainment options at home, but also because many are actively belligerent towards natural, social fun.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do about it, but would love to hear if others have noticed the same or can think of ways to combat or insulate ourselves from such efforts to suck the joy out of life in the future.</p></p>

        <p>Relaxed people enjoying life are exhibiting a lack of fear and that threatens the world view of panic junkies.  It also imperils their illusion of moral superiority.</p>

        <p>In my opinion its a consequence of ever-changing restrictions, new rules that doesnt make any sense, general fearmongering and all that stuff. Lot of ppl are going nuts just because of this, some have additional problems with their income as small bussineses are restricted not to mention tourism and other services. I would not like to be in shoes of lets say fitness center owner in my country... so i think i can understand that whole pandemic shit is frustrating for all of us. The other thing is that "covid turned fear into a virtue" which is easy to see in some ppl. Hysteria and the "this is apocalypse" attitude in pll is something i dont like to be put up with. I mean to see your only life goal to stay safe from now on and follow the rules that dont make any sense most of the time, while thinking that your mask or jab is saving the world is just bullshit.
The whole approach of ppl in power towards covid outbreak is making everybody else to loose their common sense</p>

<p>What is this? A personal attack?</p>
<p>Come on man, there are so many places for them to skateboard. Do they have to do it in high traffic areas in the city? Also, I swear half of them are 35.</p>
<p>Anyway, joking aside... I feel you.</p>
<p>It does seem like misery loves company and a lot of people have miserable souls.</p>

        <p>lol</p>
<p>Depends. I assume you are thinking ‘they should skateboard somewhere less high traffic’ whereas I am criticising people who say ‘they should stay home alone, skateboarding doesn’t contribute to society!’</p>
