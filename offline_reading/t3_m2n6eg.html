    <strong>I don't care wether covid exists or not</strong>
    <p><p>Stop apologising to muzzle wearers by saying "no one denies covid exists" that's cucked behavior, wether covid exists or it doesn't (and it most probably does) it's trivial. It's a virus biologically very similar to the flu and clinically and statistically it behaves just like the flu. With all this authoritarianism being imposed it's normal for someone to be sceptic regarding even the existance of this "nOvEl vIrUs" that seems indistinguishable from the flu. If Ebola or Zika was here,  even those who live under a rock would have noticed it, if the media had concealed covid nobody would have guessed something different was going on .</p></p>
