    <strong>The Darkhorse Podcast. Discussing suppression of alternate COVID treatments and other data</strong>

<p>Hey everyone. I found this to be a particularly poignant episode as it concisely frames the themes surrounding the vaccines. At least the themes I have personally been questioning - that being, if COVID is such an urgent threat, why would anyone suppress discussion of low-risk, highly promising alternatives that can either compliment the vaccine or can be offered as a consolation to those that can't or won't get vaccinated. </p>
<p>Bret and Heather present a handful of compelling studies to support their claims, outline some of the risks, and offer a grounded and reasonable perspective.   </p>
<p>So, it can be useful to help frame up your own concerns, and also provide some studies that you can look at yourself and either debunk or use to strengthen your arguments - point being it goes beyond mere speculation.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine is the end goal.  </p>
<p>It’s always been the end goal.</p>
<p>It’s the only explanation for the fear porn, inflated case and death counts, miserable lockdowns etc.</p>
<p>Could be for depopulation, or just a money grab, but it’s painstakingly obvious there was little effort amongst governmental infrastructure to seek anything other than a vaccine to deal with the situation.</p>

        <p>I am aware of this possibility. However, the ability to achieve vaccination requires a narrative. I think The Dark Horse podcast is poking valuable holes in that narrative and are grounded enough to do so carefully and with promising data. That is probably the way we can win this thing.  </p>
<p>I know for myself, despite being in support of NNN ideas, any people or even professionals that are prone to certain accusations or espousal of certain theories comes OFF sounding conspiratorial. This isn't to say they aren't right. But that it may delay willingness to consider opposing views because it sounds so radical.   </p>
<p>Just look at Alex Jones. Has he been right on a lot of stuff? Seems that way. But he has done so at the price of looking like a crazy person. I get it. I am not judging it. There is a place for that. But I do think it helps having sensible, more relatable voices as well.</p>

        <p>I've watched a ton of Dark Horse, but I haven't seen them address a number of issues. Have they ever talked about empty hospitals? Have they ever talked about incentives for hospitals to code Covid via the Cares Act.</p>

        <p>I haven't seen them talk about empty hospitals or the cares act specifically. Toward the end of the episode they do cite a study that found severe over-reporting of COVID deaths though.   </p>
<p>They don't seem to be in favour of stating absolute facts, or perhaps they only focus on specific issues. But they do raise a lot of valuable questions.</p>
