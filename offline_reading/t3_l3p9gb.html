    <strong>Was this a fair response?</strong>
    <p><p>I recently responded to someone's comment on /r/JMU in a thread about notifying the university if you test postitive for COVID.  The comment that I responded to was as follows:</p>
<p>&rt; question - for various reasons i’m 99% certain i had covid over winter break, but this was long after i got home and of course haven’t been to jmu (or really anywhere else) since. should i still report this?</p>
<p>I said this in response:</p>
<p>&rt; The question that you should ask yourself is, (A) what business is it of JMU's about an illness that you contracted and recovered from while you were away from the campus, and (B) how does reporting it to the university benefit you personally in any way? If you can't give a good answer to both of those questions - especially the second one - then don't tell the university about it.</p>
<p>No one else responded to this branch of the thread.</p>
<p>As of this writing, my comment's score is +6 with the dagger symbol.  That high of a positive score kind of surprised me.  The dagger was not that surprising, but I was expecting to be downvoted pretty hard for it.</p>
<p>What do the folks here think about my response?  Was that pretty fair?  I'm concerned that I sounded a bit jaded, with its being almost 18 years since I graduated, and not having that fond of a memory of JMU, remembering JMU as being a little too involved in its students' personal lives.</p></p>

        <p>Sounded like a very reasonable response to me. Like you said, It's really not the school's business whether you got sick or not off campus.</p>
