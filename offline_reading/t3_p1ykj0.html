    <strong>No one will take your health responsibility on but you</strong>
    <p><p>I heard someone tell their employer they would take the vaccine if they would sign something that said the employer would be responsible if any vaccine injury occured.</p>
<p>The employer said no. So the employee didn't take it. </p>
<p>And pharmaceutical companies are protected by law. It's no skin off their backs if something happens to you.</p>
<p>We are protected too (Americans) but we are GIVING away our protection. Or allowing others to take it from us. Stand strong or support those that are.</p></p>

        <p>This is the main point of everything !! You have to take the burden 100% yourself .. yet the company that makes it , is insulated from any repercussions if adverse reactions happen  and that’s supposed to be fine with me ?</p>

        <p>I found great comfort in finding this group. My family keeps coming at me. (And other people do too of course.) First about masks and now about this. It's just too much. </p>
<p>I don't even judge them for what they chose! I don't blame them for being scared, or doing things that make themselves feel better. Once in awhile I share fair warnings that I hear, but they want nothing of it. Mostly, I just say things about my perspective only when they come after what I chose. </p>
<p>I've decided that I'm not going to allow people to treat me poorly over this stuff. It started to get to me for a minute, but then I realized.... They don't pay my bills. They don't live my life. I wouldn't let them treat me like this for any other reason. Why would this be the exception? It's not.</p>

        <p>That is the perfect mindset for this situation we are in ... if someone cannot respect your wishes about your body , friend family or foe , they need to be removed from your life , I’ve done it and will continue to do it to ANYONE who tries to force their will on me . That’s just the way it has to be .. and people like us are our new family ...  we are now all
Brothers in this fight stay strong !</p>

        <p>It's not like they have to be dead to me, but I now have like a mute button for their input. It went from feeling like a fog horn in my ear (which is what they want) to a whisper that I can ignore. Like everything else people say that doesn't pertain to me, zoned out. </p>
<p>It is liberating!</p>
<p>You too. Stay strong! It's a ridiculous battle but one we have to stand through together.</p>
