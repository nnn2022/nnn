    <strong>It's Time for You Doomers to Wake the F*ck Up!</strong>
    <p><p>This is for you COVID doomers perusing this sub:</p>
<p>You obeyed.  You stayed home.  You wore masks for a year.  You listened to Fauci and THE SCIENCE™ and got your two vaccines.  </p>
<p>Now your precious CDC will tell you you still have to wear a mask indoors again.  Of course, this is based on "cases," which used to mean sick people, but now means positive PCR tests.  The same tests that the same CDC is recommending be scrapped because they can't differentiate coronavirus from the flu.</p>
<p>The mask is necessary to scare us all into submission for another round of pandemic emergency stimulus.  Trillions more debt spending, with plenty of pork to make it back to the grifter politicians.  Stupid economic distortions will continue.  Watch the eviction moratorium get extended so property owners continue to get screwed.  Watch more restaurants and small businesses go under because people will stop going again.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile the administration is trying to make Long COVID (which is basically every symptom ever) sufferers qualify for disability payments.  Watch as that program balloons to 15 to 20 million more people on the government dole.  Watch an entirely new industry be created as doctors make money diagnosing people with Long COVID and big pharma launches EUA drugs to treat it, and people flock to get diagnosed so they can get their monthly checks from Uncle Sam.  </p>
<p>At what point will you COVID zealots realize what's going on?  You think the government cares about your health?  They are robbing you blind, you morons.  How many years of "emergency" before you figure out it's a pretense to make enough people dependent on the government that it becomes even more powerful and unaccountable than it already is?  Which then allows politicians to steal even more from the citizenry?</p>
<p>Meanwhile they will keep us divided with propaganda.  Vaxxed vs. Unvaxxed.  Red vs. Blue.  Race vs. race.  And you keep falling for it.</p>
<p>It's all of us vs. an authoritarian system.  Wake the f*ck up you doomers!  </p>
<p>Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>It was a few different things - Fauci started talking about double masking, "variants" emerging, realizing that none of the dire predictions were coming true, knowing more and more people in real life who had COVID and recovered no problem. It literally was just like opening my eyes and being like, oh. It's all bullshit.</p>

        <p>Ugh, I'm trying. I only have two people in real life who are awake - my nephew's nanny and my mom's cleaning lady (who is from Poland and is APPALLED at what's going on here). I'm noticing the more "successful" people are the less likely they are to know or acknowledge the truth - they have too much to lose by being on the side of the opposition.</p>

        <p>I get it.  It's political correctness on steroids.  And it won't end with COVID.  Pretty soon you won't be able to question that the world is going to end in 12 years because of Climate Change.  </p>
<p>I have a friend who lived in one of the Soviet countries.  He said that the difference between that and what is going on now is that everybody knew privately that the State was corrupt and anything they said was bullshit.  There was a certain camaraderie about complaining and making fun of it behind closed doors, while toeing the line publicly.  The problem here is that half of our society doesn't see what's happening, so they still BELIEVE in everything.</p>

        <p>Happening, in a country with 99%+ mask compliance, and yet "cases" are spiking there.  Japan was held up as a paradigm of how to control COVID last summer, and used as a bludgeon against all of us retarded Americans who were concerned about personal liberty and knew that masks were safety theater at best.  Few people question that, and are prepared to go back to the face rags thinking they make a difference.</p>

        <p>Heroes these days are everywhere.  I'm told the grocery store cashier is a hero, as is the UPS driver.  Until now, the doomers couldn't be heroes because they were SAFER AT HOME™, but now that they have done their part by getting double vaccinated, and continue to mask, they most certainly qualify as heroes too!

        <p>Well said. If they cared about our health they'd have a psa about taking supplements such as vitamin C and D plus zinc. Not to mention push people to get into better health. They want people at odds with each other. Hence all the new labels so we can fight with each other or label anyone racist who doesn't agree. They are slowly killing free speech. Even YouTube was banning people for talking about the lab leak which now that trump's out of office they're willing to talk about it blaming trump when it was the media who refused to do any actual investigation. I didn't even vote for trump but I could see through the bs of MSM. It's all propaganda and they want a civil war.</p>

        <p>Yup, like animals in cages people don't know how to actually live a real, autonomous life anymore. I've been thinking about my own life and how I want to proceed from here and I'm at a loss. How can I live without my phone, the internet? My job is entirely screen based. I have no worthwhile survival skills - can't even keep a plant alive more than a couple weeks. I kind of think I'm screwed.</p>

        <p>Well said!  As far as I'm concerned, "cases" are still sick people.  The cases for COVID are just positive PCR tests.</p>
<p>I have to say, I am not sure if the CDC is really going to start mask crap again.  I've been looking and the only idiot out of those people really discussing this crap is Fauci and CBS, CNN, etc.  You know the usual suspects.</p>
<p>That is my term for it- "mask crap".  My best condolences to them on trying to get Florida to do anything, it won't happen.</p>

        <p>The working class is definitely the useful idiots. Society could not be maintained without it and the compensation does not match the effort required.  Living on unemployment or welfare isn't trivial either though... It's not just a free handout with no strings attached as so many people like to parrot.  The mental side of things must be considered, a lot of people tie their personal worth to their work and having that taken away can be devastating. Being fired can put an individual in a hole that cannot be easily escaped. Especially in the current job market, any job hiring the unemployed without a useful degree or skill set is likely absolute shit. No company wants to pay above what unemployment was dishing out and the jobs that do pay that much are overworking/understaffing their employees to keep the bottom line the same. </p>
<p>The only real winners are the upper class, everyone else is just contributing to their vision of reality. To be fair, that has always been the case, it's just exacerbated in the current circumstance. </p>
<p>I responded to your comment for two reasons: I wanted to address your comment about people taking government handouts, I don't think their views are that different from your own and applying a singular mindset to that entire group isn't fair or accurate, and I wanted to confirm that we are indeed the useful idiots. I only intended to type one sentence, but here we are. I may not necessarily agree with everything in this sub, but it is important to consider all viewpoints when contemplating your own.</p>

        <p>The partisan politics have gone literally out of control. I wish I had the words to describe how I feel about it, other than that it's fucking <em>ridiculous</em>. Literally every possible thing that exists now has a partisan slant to it. Every feeling, every activity, every occupation, every music genre, fucking everything.</p>
<p>I'm just depressed because I was really hoping I would be able to enjoy a world where there was more nuance and individuality. But it has become very clear that the average person is not interested in any of that. This all has to do with fitting in, and while each person may differ slightly in what they think that means, the human mind is still simple enough to be brainwashed into this two-party system.</p>
<p>I think the only way this will end will be a violent upheaval followed by a cathartic period of rebuilding.</p>

        <p>Great comment.  My awakening over the last 18 months of the COVID and political shitshows is that it is NOT partisan in the traditional sense of the word.  I've voted Libertarian in the past because neither party represented my views.  I voted for Trump not because he was a Republican, and I didn't think he was the most savory character, but he wasn't a politician and he did most of what he promised to do--expose the sham that is US politics.  </p>
<p>Now I realize just how alike the R and D parties are.  It's the same shit, different flavor.  Blue shit, red shit, it still tastes like shit.  The Rs pretend to be outraged but we keep moving to the Left.  Not classic Liberal, but hardcore Leftist.  Things that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago are now the norm, and the Overton window will continue to shift.  By the time true Liberals realize they have been swindled by Leftists and Statists, that elections are sham and we are no longer a country of laws, it will be hard to push back using traditional mechanisms.  I fear you are right in that the end won't be pretty.</p>
