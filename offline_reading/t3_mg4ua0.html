    <strong>Just another science denying fascist with some interesting info</strong>
    <p><p>Most seem to recognize that politics are playing a role in the covid pandemic and reactions to it, yet they choose to deny that the science has been changed to fit political agendas. However, there are clear instances of this happening, whether the changes are for profit or to save ones career is what we cannot know. </p>
<p>The best example is the very NEJM article I have been referencing, one of the most reputable sources. In July 2020 the authors made this statement: </p>
<p>"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less." </p>
<p>But what were the actual findings regarding masks OUTSIDE a health care facility? </p>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection... The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic... Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures... It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools, they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals. Although such reactions may not be strictly logical, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....." </p>
<p>Does this sound like a push for masking outside of health care facilities? Or even really in them aside from their symbolism? This is nothing but a blatant contradiction of their findings to save their careers in our cancel culture. </p>
<p>Another example of this horror is an article on why facemasks don't work by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC. He concluded: </p>
<p>"Literature reviews have confirmed that wearing a mask during surgery has no impact whatsoever on wound infection rates during clean surgery... No matter how well a mask conforms to the shape of a person’s face, it is not designed to create an air tight seal around the face... a study of eight brands of face masks found that they did not filter out 20-100% of particles ... etc."</p>
<p>Yet if you don't have an archived link, here is what you now see:</p>
<p>"If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate."</p>
<p>Our "current climate" is one that prefers fear over fact, control over science and reason, submission over freedom </p>
<p>Further Quotes  </p>
<ul>
<li>"It should be concluded from these and similar studies that the filter material of face masks does not retain or filter out viruses." </li>
</ul>
<p>-  "Yet there is no convincing scientific data that supports the effectiveness of masks for respiratory protection"  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Masks will always fit fairly loosely with considerable gaps along the cheeks, around the bridge of the nose and along the bottom edge of the mask below the chin." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."'  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (&lt; 2.5 μm), which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective dose is smaller than one aerosol particle."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks."  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head"  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, at the end of the day, the only thing that provides personal protection for them person wearing the mask is a respirator. And that is the thing that healthcare workers should be wearing"  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"...just want them to understand that they aren’t very much more protective than if they weren’t wearing them. And they’re really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The use of medical masks in the community may create a false sense of security, with neglect of other essential measures, such as hand hygiene practices and physical distancing, and may lead to touching the face under the masks and under the eyes"  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Delorme’s hospital went from seeing roughly 20 suicide attempts per month involving patients 15 or younger, the AP reports, to more than double that—and, disturbingly, more determination than ever before in the attempts.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“In the meantime, lockdowns and other restrictions have harshly curtailed social interaction and, tragically, catalyzing the aforementioned youth mental health crisis. Here in the US, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 25 percent of young adults considered suicide during the lockdowns, while overall mental health and suicide rates appear to have spiked as well.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Coming from both the left and right, and around the world, we have devoted our careers to protecting people. Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health. The results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health – leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ Only 17% of doctors say they will get a COVID-19 vaccine if it is authorized before all clinical trials”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Nurses were less likely than doctors to say yes (11%); 69% said no; and 20% said they were unsure. Answers did not vary substantially by age.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“On April 12, 1955 the government announced the first vaccine to protect kids against polio. Within days, labs had made thousands of lots of the vaccine. Batches made by one company, Cutter Labs, accidentally contained live polio virus and it caused an outbreak. More than 200,000 children got the polio vaccine, but within days the government had to abandon the program. "Forty thousand kids got polio. Some had low levels, a couple hundred were left with paralysis, and about 10 died," said Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician, distinguished professor, and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“From 1955 to 1963, between 10% and 30% of polio vaccines were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40).”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The government launched the program in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“One, the vaccine may not be safe. Two, if it is not safe, people will lose faith in vaccines. Three, if a vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, people will have a false sense of security and increase their risk. Four, if a substandard vaccine gets an EUA, a better vaccine may never get approval, because people would be reluctant to enroll in trials and risk getting a placebo instead of a vaccine.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Aside from questions of safety that attend any vaccine, there are good reasons to be especially cautious for COVID-19. Some vaccines worsen the consequences of infection rather than protect, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE has been observed in previous attempts to develop coronavirus vaccines.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“As recently as 2016, Dengavxia, intended to protect children from the dengue virus, increased hospitalizations for children who received the vaccine.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“From the start, we had police officers who intervened, made arrests, and gave tickets for non-compliance with sanitary measures,” Couture said. “We are mostly talking about not wearing a mask and physical distancing.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Police said they had made 33 arrests, most for COVID regulation breaches, after up to 10,000 people gathered holding banners with slogans such as “Stop Destroying Our Kids’ Lives”…  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Police were criticized for using heavy-handed tactics to break up an outdoor vigil for 33-year-old Sarah Everard on March 13. A police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder.”   </p>
