    <strong>Living and working in Toronto and wanting to evacuate (Any fellow Canadians here?)</strong>
    <p><p>As my title says, I've been living and working in Toronto throughout the pandemic. I am a young woman who just graduated from university in the Spring and was hoping to move out to the East coast for graduate school, with the ultimate dream of living a simple, traditional, quiet life. I work a minimum wage job as a cashier at an independent organic grocery store trying to save up to get out of this city, but as the months pass I feel a growing sense of despair burrowing in my heart at not only the increasingly fading promise of a personal future for myself, but for my fellow human beings.</p>
<p>Each day I encounter dozens, if not hundreds of people who appear to be existing in utter fear, chaos, paranoia, etc.,  with bovine eyes attached to stressed and neglected bodies that still insist on rushing around with foolish self-importance, while still others seem to be in a completely unconscious state, with their AirPods plugged in, avoiding all eye contact or communication, aloof and detached, staring into their phones. Then there are those who approach with a most forlorn gaze, demoralized tone of voice, and defeated of postures; the kindred souls whom I see desperately yearning for connection and intimacy and purpose, whose lives have clearly been upended in ways I understand and those I cannot imagine. I make a point of learning their name, inquiring into their wellbeing, and offer my fellowship and solidarity, even if only for a brief moment, even if only in a kind word, or helping them to their cars and trying to make our conversation as meaningful as possible. Up until the fall, our store was still allowing people people in without masks (all they had to do was say they had a medical reason), and I had the most interesting and inspiring conversations with people who were actually resisting this tyranny, but we have since changed our policy such that you cannot step foot in the store and buy food unless you are wearing one (as was/is the case everywhere else in the city), and those customers have largely vanished.</p>
<p>I am deeply troubled by the reality that not only am I made to enforce this by-law onto others that I myself find to be such a profound violation of our autonomy and humanity as sovereign beings, but that I must do so to my own self, or else would not be employed and could not afford food, rent, or the prospect of transcending my current circumstances. And now with this recent update that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/kaicd6/its_official_ontario_to_issue_proofofvaccination/">there will be proof-of-vaccincation cards in Ontario in order for the populace to partake in society</a> I feel my decision to remain steadfast in my convictions against this vaccine is soon to be thwarted and I truly wonder how those of us who do not wish to partake in their experiment will fare in the end.</p>
<p>I'm curious, does anyone else on this forum live in Toronto, the GTA, Ontario, or Canada? What have your experiences been like throughout all this-- personal, occupational, academic, social, spiritual, existential, etc.? Do you recognize the country you were born into? How do you carry on when the future is so precarious and make plans which may never come to fruition because of still greater laws and restrictions on our freedoms we have yet to imagine? Have you been able to find like-minded people (by that I mean free-thinking individuals who are open and willing to engage with other perspectives and arguments, etc.) in real life, outside of online environments?</p>
<p>I appreciate you for taking the time to read my post and wish you well on your own paths throughout this lifetime and that which lies beyond.</p></p>

        <p>Come to Alberta! We’re currently under a “lockdown”, but the people’s attitudes are much better here overall, in fact, many people are saying fuck it and excited to spend time on the ski hills with their families! </p>
<p>I’d specifically recommend Calgary, Which is where I live- but I also feel like you’ll find a lot of people who are your speed- the surrounding communities of Okotoks, Chestermere and Airdrie are close to a lot of acreages where you can live on the land but still be close to city/town amenities, and there’s an active natural health and naturopathic network as well, lots of farm-to-table interest and lots of vegan restaurants. That being said, it’s a good moderate city, socially liberal, open minded and grounded, it’s very family-oriented and you’ll easily be able to find a good community here! </p>
<p>Unfortunately we don’t have an ocean... but there’s lots of lakefront property and UofC and UofA have good grad programs as well!</p>

        <p>That’s true! I forgot to mention- vaccines are NOT mandatory anywhere in Alberta! At schools, you simply tell the teachers that your child is “vaccinated by our family doctor” or opt out and there’s no problems. Judgement maybe, but no threats and your child just chills in the class or the library while they are going on.</p>

        <p>Well, what helped is Kenney has said he won't mandate it and appears to be under significant protest pressure not to backslide.</p>
<p>I also plan on fleeing here if the situation deteriorates. I understand the economic situation is pretty grim if you're not in the trades, though?</p>

        <p>Not at all? I just graduated from University and worked part-time admin the whole time as well as other typical young person jobs, and currently am looking into more admin in the near future- theres jobs in other industries as well not connected to O&amp;G. </p>
<p>My mom does medical coding and my dad has a dental tech business- both are decent jobs to have, afford us a decent lifestyle, as well as jobs in education- teaching, para professionals to help special needs kids, school admin, and a thriving IT/software engineering sector as well, that just doesn’t get talked about as much. Calgary also has a strong artistic sector, fashion and entertainment with lots of need for marketing professionals. Engineering and Civil Engineering are also a good bet- as well as jobs all over the non profit and public sector if you are looking for that.</p>
<p>There’s lots of jobs out there- they simply don’t pay the amounts of money that O&amp;G do/did, but you won’t be unemployed or starving by a long shot.</p>

<p>I actually do have family in Northern Alberta, haha. I've always been drawn to the Maritimes, and coastal living, so I never really gave much thought to the Prairies, but I'm going to check out these towns you suggested! Definitely more my speed, as you've said. Thank you for sharing!</p>

        <p>I’m in Toronto too. Very poetic way of describing things. I really agree. 
Hugs over masks rallies are the only place I’ve been able to find like-minded people in person. 
I became a first time mom in this pandemic at 25. I’ve just been avoiding society. I’ve had some very unpleasant interactions with people over mask wearing. 
I’m hoping I can make more like minded friends soon somehow. Joined a mom group , and hoping there’s maybe some online place for us to find each other at some point.</p>

        <p>I really admire these grassroots movements and hope they continue to stay active even in the colder months ahead, I'd love to join a rally. </p>
<p>What a huge life change to be undergoing now, congratulations!! I do hope you can find other young mothers to connect with to support you and that your little one gets to interact with other children to help foster their social development. It brought tears to my eyes when I saw unmasked children playing together at the park last week, where parents seemed to be more than willing to let their children play with others.</p>

        <p>I know what you mean. These little things bring me tears too because there’s such a profound message in them these days. And thank you ! 
The rally calendar can be found on their website. Actually, I just remembered when I found out about them. I was in yorkville and saw them parading by , one guy on a megaphone, someone else passing out pamphlets , and I saw this one woman who was with them give this huge hug to a homeless man and I just busted out crying and was like “we need to go find them” to my husband</p>

        <p>I used to live in Canada, in BC, for over 12 years, but we moved back to the U.S. 3 years ago. My husband and I are both dual citizens and felt nostalgic. We actually were going to move back again to Canada and then Covid hit. I think the people in both countries have gone mad and now it seems no place is safe. We do the best we can to defy all the restrictions, but we can't sustain a rebellion without others who are willing to speak up and not comply. The only way this ends is for millions of us to protest in the streets. Speak up, organize, fight!!!</p>

        <p>From what I see the states seem to have varying degrees of restrictions, but I agree things do not look very good on either side of the border. I'm with you there, we need more people banding together. I really love to hear this kind of sentiment from older people such as yourself, for whom the media/doctors/politicians, etc. have been trying to speak. But I am also baffled as to why younger people aren't more disturbed by all this and seem content to stay at home and watch Netflix while a year of their precious youth is being squandered. Do you have any perspective here?</p>

        <p>Good luck. \~200 km north of Toronto is not much better. Small town, \~3-4k people. Moved up there about a month after the shitshow started up.</p>
<p>People are paranoid up here. Got stares for going to an ATM without a mask on.</p>
<p>Grocery store and hardware store, both small business, have tried to enforce EAR STRAP masks only, got reverted after a week of people not buying from them. Both had to fire at least 2/3-3/4 of staff.</p>
<p>People dont really care about Distancing, The masks seem to suffice for all most everyone.</p>
<p>When the red zone shit started up, People were actually saying stuff like "Go back to the red zone" and "You're from a red zone, aren't you?" because I have a Toronto sticker on my car.</p>
<p>However, Not a single business has implemented Contact tracing or No Cash.</p>
<p>Church has also stayed open, in person</p>
<p>Had a long chat with a neighbor, all most everyone in town doesn't trust the Vaccine and even fewer are gonna take it.</p>
<p>House prices are 1/3 for 2x the property. Prices are rising.</p>
<p>All things considered, Small towns are good FOR NOW, but that might change if shit kicks into overdrive.</p>

        <p>I second this. </p>
<p>I currently live in the GTA and our region just got placed on lockdown today. Went out for some snacks tonight and noticed a huge surge of urgency and aggression among drivers on the road. The panic has set, and it's only going to get worse from here on out.</p>
<p>If I was not tied to family in any way, my partner and I would invest in land and move off-grid in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Good luck on your journey.</p>

        <p>Beautifully said, I'm seeing the same thing. I live in Hamilton, having moved from Toronto 2 years ago. I was fortunate to find a very affordable apartment but am praying for the opportunity to find some people to move rural with. I want to grow my own food and rely on this nightmare society as little as possible. </p>
<p>I'm currently in the process of selling some of my belongings and trying to organize any friends who don't think I'm crazy to get out of here with. </p>
<p>In my city they just started implementing a questionnaire you have to answer to shop. Soon it will be a vaccine but I imagine that this will still not sit well with many people. Despite how forlorn and lost they seem, somehow I think this will be too much for many and there will be push back. </p>
<p>Feel free to reach out if you want to chat with someone local. I'm a 36 year old woman and I've already made one like minded friend through this forum. </p>
<p>Anyway, stay strong! You're not alone and we are out there.</p>

        <p>I feel for you. I gave up my business and rented out my condo to travel for a bit.. Had to live in my work trailer for a few months before I gtfo to Mexico when it got cold. Been here 2 weeks.  Now I have to learn Spanish. Tough to socialize in a different language.  Going to move around a bit until I find some sanity. Only bright spot is the number of people waking up to the reality of what this world really is. This is over when everyone realizes the truth.  Chin up, WE are in this together,  and I'm not including the psychopaths that shove that phrase down our throats.</p>

        <p>Very poetic post, very well said.   </p>
<p>&rt;I'm curious, does anyone else on this forum live in Toronto, the GTA, Ontario, or Canada? What have your experiences been like throughout all this-- personal, occupational, academic, social, spiritual, existential, etc.? Do you recognize the country you were born into? How do you carry on when the future is so precarious and make plans which may never come to fruition because of still greater laws and restrictions on our freedoms we have yet to imagine? Have you been able to find like-minded people (by that I mean free-thinking individuals who are open and willing to engage with other perspectives and arguments, etc.) in real life, outside of online environments?</p>
<p>I'm Canadian. On a personal level, there have been some impacts to my mental health but not like what most seem to have experienced. My grandfather has had his mental health deteriorate due to the diminished contact - he no longer recognizes family and I'm still mourning this. My wife's grandfather passed away due to non-covid reasons recently. We used to visit them once a week but he spent the pandemic isolated from us and he passed alone. Her surviving grandparent is a very bright and staunchly spiritual/religious woman, but I still see the impact this is having on her. </p>
<p>Locally, a fair amount has carried on as usual for most of the pandemic. Mental health has taken a toll but doesn't seem to be quite as dire or strongly realized as the picture you paint above; I think my region has adopted masks and distancing but is more likely to make exceptions to ensure friends, family and strangers are taken care of. I do think people around here are tired. A little ground down and stressed out;. It's less "bovines and dead eyes" and more of a pall of "the blues" that has settled in for now. At the end of the day, for better or worse, I believe my region is more likely to resist anything the government starts pushing as "mandatory". </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Do you recognize the country you were born into?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Not particularly, but I think there has been a trend to that anyways and I think that Canada has been going in a bad direction for a while now on a few issues. I don't intend to get political right now due to it being so large a topic (feel free to DM me though, if you like to chat on that), but I feel like regional wedges, shitslinging and uncharitable takes are way, way up right now and that impacts me almost more than the pandemic does. I will say that I am surprised and dismayed at what my fellow countrymen seem ready to believe, say and capitulate to. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;How do you carry on when the future is so precarious and make plans which may never come to fruition because of still greater laws and restrictions on our freedoms we have yet to imagine</p>
<p>It's hard, there is no doubt about it. I'm currently adjusting plans due to some recent news; what once was a secure and steady plan forward has been upheaved. It's exhausting to work with what-ifs and try to anticipate what the future could bring. I really wish that I had a better way to put it, or a way to ease the precariousness that I could share with you, but the ability to help with that just isn't here right now. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Have you been able to find like-minded people (by that I mean free-thinking individuals who are open and willing to engage with other perspectives and arguments, etc.) in real life, outside of online environments?</p>
<p>Some family and friends, yes. Some of my family are polar opposites on this though - very scared of the virus and completely trusting of the government. </p>
<p>I'd have to agree with the other poster about Alberta. I don't think the negative reputation the province has is fully deserved and you might be pleasantly surprised at the culture and educational quality. It might be worth a look as an option.<br>
My wife read through the post and said it sounded like something I would write - so you do have kindred spirits throughout the country on this. I very much share your concerns and hope you can get where you need to be.</p>

        <p>I'm in Toronto - yes I've felt some of things you've felt. It's strange at times, mostly I just try to find the comedy in things. Whether it's a Karen giving me shit for not wearing a mask, or reading /r/toronto and seeing how they cheer for more lockdowns, it can be demoralizing. But, I have a good group of friends to hang out with, luck has it most of my family also hate lockdowns and distancing so I can hang with them quite a bit as well.  I've already come to terms with with the fact that the people running the government are insane, which is fine, there's nothing I can do about it. In terms of an exodus, I'm thinking probably Mexico, which is a shame, I used to really love Toronto.</p>

<p>I thought about Florida but I'm not an American citizen and I wouldn't have a good government job like I do now. The only other option is to go back to my birth nation Egypt, where I don't even need to explain why that's not a good alternative.</p>
<p>I'm just monitoring this situation and speaking out to those willing to listen but it doesn't look good, most of my coworkers would take cyanide if CP24 told them to, there's zero hope here.</p>

        <p>I’m in Toronto too! 23 F and just graduated this year, living alone and most of my friends are paranoid sheep who won’t see friends until the lockdown is lifted in the city... Im really hoping the city opens up after the 21st. I have major concerns about mandatory vaccinations for travel as I had plans to go to Europe next summer and also teach English in Asia for a year. You’re not alone in your thinking! Conversations with most of my friends about the lockdown measures don’t always go well, and I’m kinda holding on to this sub for validation and so I don’t feel crazy. Feel free to PM me if you ever want to chat.</p>

        <p>Hi, I live in Sudbury. I personally don't recognize this country anymore. The amount of mental gymnastics being done to support this all is insane. I've heard that the premier of Alberta is against the lockdowns, which gives me hope for western Canada. I might have to consider moving there if Ontario becomes too out of hand</p>

        <p>Nice poetic imagery. I'm 25 and I feel the same way, and I think the plandemic has sped up my timeline for getting out of the country. Other countries commenters are saying that Alberta is alright, but I don't expect it to stay that way, on a span of years, and if I am going to relocate it will be to a place where I would be comfortable starting a family. Preferably somewhere warm near mountains and water, but that's asking a lot. My hail Mary would be <a href="https://www.fincabayano.net/1_emigration/introduction/">this expat organic farming community in Panama</a> which was started around 10 years ago in preparation for these kinds of events.</p>
<p>Thankfully all the friends I have stayed in contact with all know that the pandemic is fake, although they are at various stages of wanting to bug out. Some of them hold on to the hope that life in Canada will remain livable for 19 years which I think is naive. In the event that I do stay in Canada longer them a year my friends and I are planning on renting/buying a large house and turning it into a group house for sane people, while we acquire the funds to flee elsewhere.</p>

        <p>I feel much the same as you, friend. 
Aside from some basic preparation, I'm largely counting on some sort of awakening amongst the public. Unlikely to happen, I know. Not feeling very cozy these days.</p>
