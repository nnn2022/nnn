    <strong>I‚Äôm a prime example Covid is BS</strong>
    <p><p>Let me explain,</p>
<p>I live in Japan ‚Äúyou know that little country with a population of 129.3 million right next door to China‚Äù</p>
<p>March last year they declared an emergency and shut down most the economy here. They told us all to stay home due to the so called ‚Äúdeadly virus‚Äù</p>
<p>Though many stores  were shut down, numerous companies remained open with people working pretty much normally. Schools were shutdown but preschools remained open ‚Äúif that even makes sense‚Äù My wife‚Äôs company which has over 2,000 employees was open and operating normally.</p>
<p>I myself didn‚Äôt believe any of this bull shit sense day one, and almost every day I was out filming everything for my YouTube channel , riding trains with numerous people around me and walking around the city. Under Japanese law, they could not force people to stay home but had to ask them nicely.  I never once wore a mask and never once saw anyone sick or collapsing nor did I myself ever get sick.</p>
<p>They kept telling us hospitals were full, so I went to my cities hospitals filming and didn‚Äôt see shit going on each day. I witnessed ambulances blasting their sirens only to drive around the block and come right back with no one.  I watched the media come and set up props busing in people to film BS propaganda and then pack up and leave.</p>
<p>In May they slowly opened things back up and I went back to work. I‚Äôm an English teacher and teach at over 17 schools each week with children ages 3-10. At first some schools had kids social distancing and wearing mask. But after about a month, it stopped and things went back to normal. I‚Äôd say since late June 99% of my schools are normal with kids aloud to be kids and interact, play and no social distancing or mask wearing.  I have children come up hugging me, highfiving me, coughing and sneezing around me or even on me and wiping their nose on my pants ü§£  We go outside playing games normally and even blow bubbles and play tag. NOT ONCE HAS A SINGLE CHILD OR STAFF MEMBER BEEN SICK nor have I.</p>
<p>Every single weekend I ride super packed trains to the city walking around shops that are packed. I never wear a mask and never been sick or seen anyone else sick.</p>
<p>Christmas and New Years my wife and I went to her parents house where we had over 24 people come to celebrate and enjoy food. No one wore a mask or social distanced, we did everything normal and no one got sick.</p>
<p>So I‚Äôd love all those doomers to please explain why I have never once gotten Covid, my students never once got Covid, my wife and family members have not gotten it nor anyone I know. If you consider I‚Äôm around 1,000‚Äôs of children per day. Their parents are around others plus I got out to public around 1,000‚Äôs of people and never wear a mask.. According to their science, I and everyone around me should have gotten Covid over 100 times and been dead.</p>
<p>Yet, hello... I‚Äôm here and healthy and so are they.</p>
<p>All the restrictions are total BS, you aren‚Äôt aloud to go see your grandparents in a care home? My wife and I go see her grandma in one with no issues. Hugging her and giving her snacks.</p>
<p>The stupid rules you follow are put in place to control you, strip your freedoms and then force you to take the vaccine. Nothing more</p></p>

        <p>The response to ‚Äòwhat about Japan‚Äô was that they didn‚Äôt have to enforce because many Japanese already live reclusively. Sounds like major bs because Tokyo is a very busy city.  Thanks for your post.</p>

        <p>Consider yourself lucky since Japan is not only naturally clean, but they actually care about each other while not being taken for complete idiots. Here in good ol' Bidenland, public transit is disgusting and neighbors rat you out for daring to have fun. It's no wonder Japan is doing so much better.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôd be surprised, Japan public transportation isn‚Äôt that clean and no ones wiping down the seats or handles people hold onto. Large cities have areas with trash all over and no way to social distance. While many here do wear mask, it‚Äôs not everyone but the restrictions are definitely not like other countries. Police here could careless if you have no mask or meet many people. It‚Äôs cherry blossom season here and people meet in large groups for picnics with no issues.</p>

        <p>It's not because Japan is "naturally clean", it's because their obesity rate is like 8-9 times lower than in western countries.  In other words, Japanese people are just healthier on average because they don't eat like shit.</p>

        <p>Lucky! It's funny, despite japan having insanely busy cities and one of the oldest populations in the world, the were absolutely fine. They have double the population of the UK, yet less total cases and deaths.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago I was thinking about where I wanted to move to when done with school (I want out of Scotland for sure) and I came across the idea of living in rural Japan. Japan is an amazing country, it's beautiful, the culture is so interesting, it's a mix of cities and traditional villages and it just seems like the place for me. But I knew nothing of japan's covid response, and I was worried. Because if it was crazy and draconian, that's a bit of a deal breaker. I want to live somewhere where I know that the kind of suffering I have gone through this year will not be forced on me again. So I looked it up, and it turns out they never enforced anything draconian because the Japanese government don't actually have the authority to do that. They stopped international holidays and large events, and had some stricter stuff at the beginning but it turns out they just asked the population to do what they could, and that kind of relationship between the government and their people is one I would value - one based on trust, where the population are treated like adults. It makes me veyy happy.</p>

        <p>Damn.  I‚Äôve been trying to think of somewhere to escape to (currently in Canada), and now you mention it rural japan does sound pretty amazing haha.  I‚Äôve even got a Japanese friend I could go with.  Cuz yeah man tbh I feel ya on wanting a culture/government you can trust.  Even if the lockdowns all ended tomorrow; I‚Äôve still permanently not only lost faith, but realized how pathetic Canadians and the government are here.  People accepting the Lockdowns and masks as they have here; for me it was a wake up call to get the heck out of Canada.  I just turned 24 and realized there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm raising my future kids in this culture.  Gotta move soon</p>

        <p>I started in a new department at work and my new manager was expressing that he wanted things to go back to normal and couldnt wait till he could hug the clients again. Meanwhile I've been working in their homes and others while they were covid positive. Even knowing I was working with a positive patient I still hugged them, let them go outside (they wanted to lock them in their room for two weeks) and wasn't too harsh on mask policy ( a mask isn't going to stop you getting covid when you share the same recycled air with a roomate)  Never got covid and neither did any of my clients besides the ones that tested positive once they returned home from a 3 week Christmas vacation with their families. I never regretted  a hug and I will always hold it against those that were too scared to do so.</p>

Instead they do it by poisoning the food with pesticides, dumping flouride in the water, distract people with porn instead of real sex, get ppl to take untested vaccines, push the LGBTAi+xyz stuff... bill gates sterilizes Indian girls.

        <p>Well, kids are more resilient to most things. Kids rarely get pneumonia in general.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_shadow">Selection Shadow</a> is a fairly good explanation for why kids are so resilient. If you don't live to at least reproductive age, you're a big time evolutionary failure, so evolution would have selected out those genes long, long ago.</p>
<p>As for specifically why kids seem to be strangely completely immune to this virus while it kills old people at a relatively high rate, I am not sure. It's unlike the flu in that manner, where the flu's danger is much more evenly distributed across the age groups. </p>
<p>Kid's immunity to COVID-19 probably hasn't been studied much since it doesn't add to the fearporn everyone seems to love so much.</p>

        <p>92% of people who died of covid actually died of something else (even the CDC admits this).</p>
<p>8% of people who died of covid died of an upper respiratory  infection, most likely influenza or pneumonia (it's why the CDC now combines all these deaths).</p>
<p>That, my friends, is how you create a pandemic out of nothing.</p>
<p>Do you know why they have almost zero covid in Africa? Because they don't get CNN.</p>

Back in March and April they claimed numerous cases and declared an emergency. Then in December and January they claimed it again but still things went on normally.</p>

        <p>This is great. thanks for sharing. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT FREE SOCIETIES so people in lockdown areas know the truth.</p>
<p>In Florida (anywhere outside of big cities) it is free. I have been to countless restaurants, parties, and events (some with thousands of people) WITHOUT masks. </p>

        <p>hard to say. You and others may have gotten infected, but it may have been so mild and unremarkable, potentially even showing no symptoms at all, that you just never had a reason to know or care. On the other hand, maybe a large number of people are testing positive with no symptoms because the tests are junk, and they aren't infected at all. We know the tests really are junk, and we know there really are plenty of people who report extremely mild symptoms. It pretty much doesn't even matter, either way it's just nonsense.</p>
<p>for reference I've worked at a nursing home for the past year and I've seen a shit ton of positive cases. These are some of the questions I wonder to myself about. The COVID I'm seeing at my job is just as trivial as the COVID you're seeing.</p>

        <p>Very nice to read it from a person from Japan. I have heard some of it elsewhere, but your statement is a nice summary of the situation.
I've been seeing the Wagakki Band live concerts in YouTube, which they recorded last March, and it feels so natural in there.
I'm planning to visit Japan next year as well.

        <p>I'm a Japanophile (who has sadly never been able to travel there üò≠) and I've been wondering how Japan has been doing through all this because I know the Japanese people tend to be very reclusive, and more or less repressed. </p>
<p>As in, they'll just go along with the rules because they don't want to cause trouble and draw attention to themselves. Like, are they still cramming people into trains even though it's supposed to be 6ft of distance? Are there people who are just eschewing mask rules in densely populated city centers? </p>
<p>I respect the Japanese people and love their culture, but have been wondering if there are many who are rebelling against all this stuff, or if there's just no need to because they're too timid to call each other out.</p>

        <p>You mean the exaggerated blown way out of proportion BS numbers? Where they pretty much claimed anyone who died from anything had Covid? üòÇ</p>
<p>Yeah ok... </p>
<p>Man dies from a motorcycle crash.. Nope it‚Äôs covid</p>
<p>Man falls off a latter and dies.. Nope it was covid</p>
<p>Woman drowns in a pool.. Nope it was covid</p>
<p>Obese woman dies of a heart attack.. Nope Covid strikes again</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My grandma died of bowel blockage, they wrote it off as Covid.. so yeah, 2.5 million who died üòÇü§£ More like people who died from other things and then they through a bunch of exaggerated numbers on top to scare the dumbed down masses like you.</p>

        <p>Ok, so I‚Äôm going explain something that you are going to have to try and process with your two brain cells: that doesn‚Äôt fucking happen you idiot.</p>
<p>I did a google search and didn‚Äôt find a single reliable/up to date source that says this. If you can find one from a reliable source, then I will believe you.</p>

        <p>Grammar tip! You use quotations where you should be using parentheses, so "where I'm at" should instead be (where I'm at).</p>
