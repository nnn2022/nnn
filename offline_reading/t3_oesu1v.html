        <p>&rt;but the move has sparked fury from adults waiting for their COVID-19 shot and from teachers who argue they should be given priority.</p>
<p>Bwahahahaha.</p>
<p>This cannot get any sadder and more pathetic. Whiny "adults". Teachers nowadays put their lives ahead of students. Fuck that noise.</p>

        <p>I’d say a lot of the teachers subscribe to the cult of Wokeism. </p>
<p>Hasn‘t a study just been published suggesting that Pfizer has lost a large percentage of it’s efficacy against the Delta variant that’s caused Australia to lock down most of the states?</p>
<p>That study was based off 2-doses as well.</p>

<p>This country is an absolute clown show and nothing makes sense.</p>

        <p>Wait everyone has got their panties in a twist over people jumping the queue, not a single comment about how children were vaccinated without knowledge/consent from their parents?  Seriously fuck this country</p>

        <p>Parents knew fully, and actually had to consent. Your misinformed. Most boys consented themselves since they are 18.</p>

        <p>Given the historical awful treatment of aboriginal people I find this suspect, sounds like eugenics, or an attempt at it, disguised as a humanitarian effort. Could be a mixup as described but idk.</p>
<p><strong>”after a plan to inoculate ONLY Aboriginal students somehow went awry</strong> and resulted in 163 boarders from the high-fee school receiving their jabs.”</p>
<p>“If the alleged reason St Joseph’s <strong>students got access to Pfizer was due to the risk of spreading COVID to Indigenous communities, then a far more effective solution would be to vaccinate those communities instead,”</strong> he said.”</p>
<p><em>Dr. Kalokerinos interview from 1995</em></p>
<p>“It is hardly necessary to introduce <strong>Dr. Kalokerinos. He is well known worldwide as the doctor who spent much of his time fighting for the wellbeing of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia.</strong> He is so much appreciated for his work and for his engagements that many, lovingly, call him ‘Archie’ He wrote down his experiences in the masterpiece <strong>"Every Second Child".</strong> Instead of being rewarded for doing so, he was harrassed and his methods were disregarded by the authorities, probably because they were too simple, too cheap and too efficacious to fit modem medical standards. And, besides, they were meant to protect a population which, in its own native county, is regarded by some as not worth taking the trouble for anyway. Dr. Kalokerinos thought differently. <strong>He pinpointed the increase in vaccination campaigns as the reason why, at a certain point, up to half of the vaccinated Aboriginal infants died, obviously from an acute vitamin C deficiency provoked by the vaccination.</strong></p>
<p>“IVN: So <strong>what is your final conclusion</strong> from your experience after so many years?</p>
<p>Kalokerinos: <strong>My final conclusion after forty years or more in this business is that the unofficial policy of the World Health Organisation and the unofficial policy of Save the Children’s Fund and almost all those organisations is one of murder and genocide. They want to make it appear as if they are saving these kids, but in actual fact they don’t. I am talking of those at the very top.</strong> Beneath that level is another level of doctors and health workers, like myself, who don’t really understand what they are doing. <strong>But I cannot see any other possible explanation: It is murder and it is genocide. And I tell you what: when the black races really wake up to what we have done to them they are not going to thank us very much.</strong> And if you want to see what harm vaccines do, don’t come to Australia or New Zealand or any place, go to Africa and you will see it <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio">there.”</a></p>
