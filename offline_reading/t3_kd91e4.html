<title>If this year has taught me anything -- it's that our modern society has an extreme fear of death and will do anything to avoid facing their own mortality. Even if it means living like treeified shut-ins.</title>

    <p><p>They pretend all these lockdowns are selfless and for the greater good, but in reality they're sending millions of people into eternal poverty and are completely fine with it as long as it means they don't have to face a 0.5% chance of mortality.</p>
<p>That's the epitome of selfish.</p>
<p>And no dweebs, it isn't normal to fear death this much. I'm sure it's always made people uneasy, but I've read enough books to know that for most of human history, people accepted that death was a part of life and nothing to fear.</p>
<p>The media has trained you to be a pathetic coward.</p></p>
