    <strong>Do you ever think to yourself if covid 19 is real?</strong>
    <p><p>Like I'm 100% positive it exsists </p>
<p>But I get lowkey skeptical when flu seasons have disappeared all over the world "have a look in a South Africa and Victoria Australia" </p>
<p>Nursing home deaths in Victoria are also 1000 deaths down compared to last year</p>
<p>Everyone who dies is being marked as covid 19 
And in some places over the world the population death rate is the same as last year considering lockdown is killing people </p>
<p>I also point to the testing kits kary mullis the inventor (who died last year sadly) said the kits shouldn't be and can't be used for viral infections and how if you cycle enough of someone's DNA you can pretty much find anything and how the tests test for RNA not for a live virus, prolly explains the whole asymptomatic fiasco</p>
<p>And how does a so called "second wave" have the same cases as a first wave but no deaths or hospitalisations, also no hospitals have yet been overwhelmed with covid patients in fact they've been quietly empty </p>
<p>Before doomers take what I say out of context yes I do think a virus is out there but it's fun to theorise</p></p>

        <p>No. Cases are up because testing is up. Treatments are better. Demographics being infected are different. Just because the danger is exaggerated doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>Well, they named it Covid-19 because</p>
<p>CO = Corona. 
 VI = Virus. 
 D = Disease. 
19 = 2019. (the year it was discovered)</p>

        <p>I have thought a lot about this, and while I can’t give you an answer, there <em>is</em> something that really made me question all of this:</p>
<p>I’m going to say this story is all theoretical. It’s going to be pretty lengthy.</p>
<p>Back in July, my father (who is obviously qualified) was asked to coordinate our town’s COVID testing program for nursing homes. For 3 weeks, he coordinated how many tests would be done and where, who gave the tests, and the assembly/transportation of tests being sent to the state-run laboratory.</p>
<p>About a month after he finished this job, my family and I were asking him questions about the process (we are all skeptics) and what he thought about it all. He told us that everything was fine, and that he enjoyed it. About an hour later, he brought the subject back up, and it was clear that something about it had been bothering him.</p>
<p>He told us that one day, theoretically of course, him and his co-workers (which during this time, he was their boss) were talking about how insane the COVID lockdowns have been. So, they started scheming and decided to assemble some extra tests (about 15 or so) consisting of swabs that had NOT been used on patients. I’m not talking about a control group - those are labeled and documented appropriately. They actually labeled and sent tests as if they were patient samples. I don’t know all the logistics, but I know that my dad ensured it was done without raising any red flags. And yes, this was very unprofessional and probably prohibited, but they didn’t really think anything would come of it.</p>
<p>Long story short, about 13 days later, the test results for the “fake tests” all came back positive for COVID-19. All of them. It’s unfortunate because my dad didn’t feel like he could say much about it, mostly because what they did wouldn’t have been authorized. But it also wouldn’t be taken seriously even if it <em>was</em> authorized.</p>
<p>Even after that, he doesn’t deny the existence of COVID or anything. We both think that for most people, it’s just a bad case of the sniffles. But he definitely believes that those tests (which were provided by the state) are rigged, and that all of this lockdown and mask lunacy has been based on manufactured false positive tests. He now refuses to ever get a COVID test, and I don’t blame him.</p>

        <p>Ahhhh 
Yea that makes sense, more evidential that a lot of labs in Florida and other states had a 90-100% false positive result rate 
And after you learn how easy it is to fake a test you start to realised how fucked up and easy it is to make a bunch of bullshit cases to create a "second wave" or "outbreak"</p>

        <p>It exists, but the restrictions are a massive overreaction and the so-called "tests" produce a lot of false positives, so not as many people have it as one might think. The flu season has probably disappeared since a lot of false positives for COVID via the test are probably the flu.</p>

        <p>i think it's entirely possible that it doesn't exist at all.</p>
<p>it probably does, but it has not to my knowledge been formally proven via koch's postulates. and I think that the media machine is 100% capable of literally whipping up a fake pandemic out of thin air. it could turn out to be just the flu re-branded and i would not be the least bit surprised</p>
