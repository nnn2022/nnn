        <p>To be fair, a kiwi fruit and a Coke have tested positive too. I suspect that there's a good chance that the test is as faulty as the vaccine.</p>

        <p>So the president of tanzania sent in some fruit and i think a monkey sample...they came back positive. But this is why i commented. His son also got covid and was sick. But instead he received ginger and lemon and (paraphrasing) 'my son was able to do push ups within a few (2) days'. If you look at my history from march on the sub wuhan flu youll see that ive been saying this same thing for months. I take ginger and lemon and havent been sick for years. My boss is chinese and her family came here at the height of covid right before the lockdowns kicked in. Ppl at my work had covid. Its the damn flu take your vitamins like gma said and youll be fine. Also my dad had covid (this new flu). I told him to take that too. Within 3 days he was able to go back to work.</p>
<p>Ginger + lemons + body &rt; pfizer vaccine</p>
<p>And besides its fucking ginger and lemons. No one will die from it. Noooo oneeer. And 0 side effects too other than maybe puckered lips from the lemons</p>

        <p>His son was very healthy to begin with and had high levels of various vitamins and minerals that a lot of people in the United States (and rest of the 1st world) are deficient on today.</p>
<p>Oh and as to no one will die from it? There are people who are fatally allergic to ginger and have died from it. Just like most other spices in the world have had at least one fatality linked to them.</p>

        <p>My father drinks about 4 beers a day every day for 10+ years and only eats bbq. Im on the other end and am skinny and under weight. As for ginger and allergies i didnt even think of that. Never even heard of it but i can believe you on it. Although....pfizer of sum ginger? One of those things is not like the other. </p>
<p>Im not trying to start a debate or have ppl point out the million other differences as to why ginger somehow wont work even though they themselves never tried it before. This happens with doomers all the time. Its why i even stopped mentioning what has haleped me. </p>
<p>Try it when you get the flu. Its $5 from the store to get the stuff. Chances are you wont have allergies to worry about (especially if you tried sushi before you prolly already had ginger). You have nothing to loose and i am confident that youll feel better too after üòÉ i mean when we got the flu gma always said "take some vitamin c" now in 2020 we got to worry about 'he was this healthy' '3rd vs 1st world countries' 'vtamic c isnt the same vitamin c as before' just try it. Its like eating sushi with ginger and lemomande in a way....just....stronger</p>
<p>Im not telling you to inject something in your veins. Im saying nature may already have an answer and i say we try out the natural before we even think of this pfizer shit let alone take it. Natural has worked for me and my family.</p>

        <p>You can't be making this shit up.</p>
<p>Oh yea, but she got sick because "she didn't receive the second dose" yet. Give us a break. Lol. 95% effective. Sure hahahahah  </p>
<p>From bottom of the article:</p>
<p>"We know from the vaccine clinical trials that it‚Äôs going to take about 10 to 14 days for you to start to develop protection from the vaccine,‚Äù Ramers said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat first dose we think gives you somewhere around 50%, and you need that second dose to get up to 95%,‚Äù Ramers added."  </p>
<p>What he fails to mention is he refers to the following study;  </p>
<p>"The studies are touted as involving tens of thousands of people, but in Pfizer‚Äôs trial, only 170 of them were reported as being ‚Äúdiagnosed with COVID-19‚Äù during the trial. Of those, 162 were in the placebo group and eight were in the vaccine group. From this, it is inferred that the vaccine prevented 154/162 people from developing the disease, or ‚Äú95%‚Äù. But as even the British Medical Journal points out, ‚Äúa relative risk reduction is being reported, not absolute risk reduction, which appears to be less than 1%.‚Äù   </p>
<p>So yea. Remember this folks in upcoming months when everyone will be defending the shortcomings of the vaccine. Copy and paste this last paragraph like your life depends on it.</p>

        <p>In fairness, vaccines often take a two weeks to work. You see this sort of thing with all types of vaccinations. It just seems like bad luck rather than proof of anything in particular about this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Except this one is undertested and out of 170 participants in the study who had Covid only 8 received the vaccine others had the placebo. I can administer my own placebo as well, thank you very much xD</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, this vaccine is <em>bullshit</em>. They'll be giving me this untested shit over my dead body. My only contention is that getting the disease shortly after getting the shot doesn't really mean anything.</p>

        <p>yes but even then the studies are questionable at best and also indicate the antibodies don't last more then 2-3 months, meaning we should uptake the shots regularly.... on top of which we already know about drug that kills covid once you have it and they developed antibodies from lammas gut that can be inhaled orally and actually work once you get the disease so no need for preventive measures as it seems quite effective... but I have a case we ain't gonna see them roll out with that any time soon :P wonder why ahhahah</p>

        <p>So many goal posts to be worked with...</p>
<p>First they say you have to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Then they say that even if you take the vaccine, nothing will change.</p>
<p>Then you take the vaccine and get contaminated, they say it's because you still have to get the second dose.</p>
<p>Then you take the second dose and still get contaminated, they'll say the vaccine is 95% effective, so you're part of the 5% that didn't get lucky.</p>
<p>Then they'll say that even if you take the vaccine and nothing happens, that doesn't mean nothing will happen in the future, meaning masks and restrictions will go on forever.</p>

        <p>This is going to happen over and over, a vaccine is NOT a blanket cure for this illness.  I still hypothesize that viral load is a huge component that determines the severity.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll give it a few months, but someone will die from covid after the vaccine.</p>
