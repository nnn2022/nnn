        <p>Doctor and Healthcare worker Facebook groups are filled with them hoping Trump ends up on a respirator or dies. Laughing about it, saying they wouldn't treat him. Only a very small minority of healthcare workers are trying to speak up against this.</p>

        <p>Bless the souls of those upholding their oath no matter how they feel politically !</p>
<p>I told a family member today that I really feel Trump's move to the hospital (allegedly) is a safety move because they right now have to be so careful about who is treating him, possibly more careful than they've ever had to be in the history of presidents.
I'd suggest to Biden to be just as cautious. The political climate right now is so scary to me, no matter what "side" they're on ...that I would be so scared to have to choose a healthcare worker for either candidate.</p>

        <p>I would say that’s because they are too busy doing their jobs. Don’t forget that the loudest voices on sites like this and Facebook are the ones who have nothing better to do than spew hate and foment division to make themselves feel better. The majority of people are either working or our trying to find work.</p>

        <p>In person too. My mom just said she's "so happy Trump is getting sent to hospital" so I said "that's not very nice" and then she joked "no I mean he's getting proper treatment", then when I didn't react she said "... it's Trump marcm6246"....

        <p>They should have started banning people a long time ago then since they were celebrating every single time someone either died from or caught the virus if the person happened to be someone who disagreed with them re COVID.  I guess it had to come to the point of someone as high-profile as POTUS.</p>

        <p>I'm a fan of the guy.  He's not just a meme made real, he's an event horizon of the memeverse made possible by the power of kek.</p>
<p>For real though once you get past his brash nature he's genuinely hilarious and is honestly trying to do the right thing for America without overstepping his bounds.</p>
<p>We're not supposed to get political here, but I do wish people would notice how absolutely one sided the media is when it comes to Trump.</p>
<p>In fact, it is almost entirely anti-Trump rhetoric with a bit of "but Biden did perfectly fine" thrown in on occasion.</p>
<p>Most of their attacks are based on things they have taken out of context or on completely fabricated fantasies.</p>
<p>And the reality that they create with their constant deception is the one that most of his haters are operating within.</p>
<p>For instance, Trump absolutely wears a mask when he believes it is needed and has for quite awhile.</p>
<p>He even advocates for their use.</p>
<p>But according to the news he never wears them and insists that other people do the same.</p>
<p>And now we have to listen to the low information throngs repeat that false narrative at the top of their lungs day in and day out.</p>
<p>There are quite a few things that he does and says that I do not agree with.  Policies included.. </p>
<p>But the guy doesn't deserve hate.</p>

        <p>Oh sure, a lot of the media is one sided against him, and then the rest of the media is one sided for him.  Fact of the matter is he is a tv personality and a politician, we didn't grow up with him, he's not our neighbor, we only know the public facade, the real him could be similar or far different.  I try to never fool myself into thinking I really know a politician or their motivations.  He's a rich guy who grew up in the rich guy world and knows a lot about manipulating the public perception, he's even bragged about it, so think very carefully before assuming he is any more honest than any of the rest of them is what I suggest.  YOu don't know him and you never will.</p>

        <p>I remember being really surprised when I learned that as a kid.  For all of our drugs and medical technology we're almost entirely powerless against viral infections.  The few antiviral drugs we have tend to be dangerous because viruses spend most of their life cycle inside host cells.  Attacking them with drugs means attacking the host cells.  </p>
<p>Our own immune system is <em>vastly</em> more sophisticated and, as you said, often the only thing doctors can do is try to help that system along.</p>

        <p>It is quite possible, both of them test positive but no symptoms?  Hmm.. And why go to the hospital if no symptoms, is it the Taj Majal of hospitals? I mean you are not going to keel over suddenly from the virus, you at least have to get the sniffles first.  It would not make sense to go to a boring hospital if you don't at least have a symptom yet as there is nothing they can do for you.  So either he showed symptoms or something else is up, maybe he just got that scared?  Anyway, he is still fairly robust, I don't think the covid threat is that huge for him personally.  The 70 plus category has about 95% survival but that bracket contains all the peeps that are already on their death bed and he's not that at all so the percentage survival for him as still fairly robust and with top of the line doctors and early detection has to be pretty high.</p>

        <p>He’s the most protected man in the world. That’s why he’s going to the hospital. He may also have a way of it, but how public that is is probably at the discretion of the hospital and/or White House. He can’t take a shit in his own bathroom without secret service inspecting it first.</p>

        <p>Somebody correct me if I'm on the wrong track, as I try to see both sides.  I am both concerned about my immunocompromised friends and elderly (parents) as well as concerned about mental and physical well-being and the economic fallout of lockdowns and restrictions.  But why is everyone who is pro-lockdown or anti-Trump feigning virtue by saying "We should be the better person, it gives us no pleasure to be right."?......My question is, what do they feel so vindicated about (thus far)?  Or is it just excitement due to potential validation?</p>
<p>Honestly I'm surprised Trump didn't get it sooner as he interacted with so many people since the beginning of the pandemic, rarely wore a mask, and demonstrated that he had zero concern by carrying on as if the virus does not exist, but isn't his diagnosis a moot point?  If it's as widespread as many claim, honestly the miracle is that it took until October.  I think as things progress it would only make a difference if he became very ill or passed away, for things to even matter politically.</p>
<p>Edit: Yeah to the downvotes, my comment doesn't so much criticize Trump as much as it criticizes the people who are hoping the worst for him or saying things like "Let this be a lesson", because the crux of the debate has never been whether or not someone will get COVID, but their chance of dying or living with permanent effects.</p>

        <p>This could either be really good or really bad. If he’s asymptomatic, he’ll reinforce that it’s basically nothing. If he gets ill, he may change but I doubt it. A lot hinging on this</p>

        <p>What really happens or what they say happens anyway.  My prediction is what they will say is he got fairly sick, enough to scare people, cuz peeps are getting tired of worrying about the virus so this should help scare a few peeps and keep the covid at the top of the news just as it was starting to sag.  Then he will re emerge looking totally fine and campaign a bunch at the last minute and brag about how tough he is to have kicked that mean old virus to the curb because he is so robust.  Kinda like what happened to Boris, now it's Trumps turn, maybe they will let the wife have fewer symptoms since she's younger.  And so it will not help us, the goal will be to keep the fear porn going.</p>

<p>THe official party line is masks are only to protect others and they don't protect you.  He had those around him wear masks and social distance, so according to the official mantra, he did follow a lot of precautions to protect himself.  IF you happen to believe the mantra anyway.</p>

        <p>Out of curiosity, how long does a fear mongering circle jerk last? I haven't seen too much fear on those other subreddits, more discussion on the actual virus and actual links to journals, while there's quite a bit of fear mongering on the media and loss of freedom. The hypocrisy is truly startling.</p>
