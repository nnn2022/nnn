        <p>As a CA resident, I'm fucking livid about this whole thing. My only hope at this point is that, perhaps his new reopening guidelines he announced last Friday were so ridiculous and unattainable that more people stand up to fight him about it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, i feel utterly powerless to do anything about anything. I just have to sit here and hope that things change, or that people more powerful than i can organize an actual resistance against his tyranny.</p>

        <p>I’m also livid that as a country we handled this so poorly that we are basically a pariah nation around the world. We could have truly shut down for a month with the government providing for everyone’s needs during that month and we could have had COVID in our rear view mirror by now. Instead, we’re basically not going to be allowed out of the country until we get a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Easy there buddy. I just don’t get why people are complaining when our current situation is the logical conclusion of how our country handled it. I’m not scared, I’m also frustrated that we didn’t handle this well. But I still wear a mask and go about daily life as best I can. It’s just tough when the pandemic was mismanaged so badly from the start.</p>

        <p>What's there to manage? It is overwhelmingly killing nursing home residents who were at death's door to begin with.</p>
<p>Best way to manage it would have been no lockdowns whatsoever. Now we have petty tyrants running roughshod over people's basic freedoms all over the country because of it.</p>

        <p>How do you explain Peru which is a country that supposedly had one of the harshest lockdowns and yet has one of the highest per capita deaths of any country if lockdowns are a good strategy?? How do you explain Australians being banned by their own government from leaving their country (since March and most likely until a vaccine is available) when we were initially praised for our lockdown strategy??? Lockdowns ala China will not work for a vast majority of countries including the US. I don't understand why so many people are hating on the US as if they ever had a chance of 'controlling' the virus.</p>

        <p>At this point I am convinced that posts like this do not originate from real people. It follows a specific script. It hits every bullet point as all the others just like it. It is interchangeable brainlessness to justify the evil dictates that have been forced upon us.</p>
<p>WizardsCantDie09, you had better hope you are a bot. If you are an actual human being, your stupidity is eclipsed only by your arrogance. Brainless thugs like you abet atrocities. You are a dime a dozen. History is rife with masses of morons like you. You are but a stooge for the tyrannical state, making excuses for the obvious authoritarian destruction being perpetrated on the people.</p>

        <p>That’s fine if you believe that I’m a bot or evil. I personally believe that shows like the Walking Dead are unrealistic because if it actually happened here half the country would be calling it a hoax and be trying to get bit to “own the libs.”</p>
<p>Evil dictates forced upon us? I literally just don’t want to be intubated and if wearing a mask helps with that, I’m fine with it.</p>
<p>To me, evil is forcing people to not listen to their survival instincts. Unless you force me at gunpoint, I’m not going to Applebee’s. Sorry buddy.</p>
<p>“Obvious authoritarian destruction” = the equivalent of wearing a seatbelt. Give me a break with your hyperbole.</p>

        <p>We had no national strategy to handle the pandemic. And now we’re dealing with the economic, medical, and mental health-related fallout.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with you all that this sucks. I just think that this outcome was to be expected in a country like ours where “we the people” has become “me the person.”</p>

        <p>I don’t consider success as 1,000 dead per day and not being allowed to leave the country.</p>
<p>Basically I wish we could have looked at what other countries did successfully and replicated that. Actual lockdowns, giving money to people each month so that they could weather the storm, contact tracing. But mostly a better tone at the top that took it seriously from the beginning. It’s hard to contain a pandemic with 50 different states all with their own operating procedures.</p>
<p>Do you think that essentially being a pariah state in the world right now when it comes to COVID is successful?</p>
<p>Again, I’m here to vent just as much as you guys. This sucks, but it is what it is. The majority of people subconsciously do not want to catch this imo, and just opening things back up or perhaps outlawing masks is not going to magically increase demand for services.</p>
<p>My family prepared for this early because it seemed like it was going to be handled liked a shit show. And it was.</p>

        <p>Yes, actually. But we should have done it earlier before it permeated the entire country. And that would have been just one piece of the puzzle. Not really worth it now. My family is good for the foreseeable future, we realized that the US was most likely going to handle it poorly and that it was going to reduce demand causing massive unemployment and homelessness. And I’m not just talking medically, the government dropped the ball with fiscal policy as well.</p>
<p>I have conservative relatives who contracted COVID and while they survived, it wasn’t pleasant for them. They were on the younger side too. So I know this is a real thing, I’m not just listening to MSM.</p>
<p>I get it, we’re all frustrated. But I’m blaming our government and it seems like you are blaming our populace for not wanting to go against a natural survival instinct? Sorry, I’m not going to blame people for listening to their own instincts.</p>

        <p>OK...you are on a subreddit called lockdown skepticism, so maybe you can imagine how we feel about your ineffective, unworkable, unconstitutional, ignorant, and incredibly harmful suggestion. Im glad you arent yet satisfied with the millions of life years lost to substance abuse, suicide, and missed or delayed medical care, and Im sorry Trump didn't gratify you personally by making the situation 50 times worse, but I think your suggestion is frankly ghoulish and I pray the day comes when that fact is more broadly recognized.</p>

        <p>First of all, please. Don’t act like America cared about substance abuse, suicide, and missed medical care before COVID. One of the major parties fights that tooth and nail and the other isn’t that much better.</p>
<p>And ghoulish? Should we all just live in caves and be on our own? Or should we try to have a society where we can work with each other and enjoy the world together. Sometimes that requires teamwork during a once in a lifetime pandemic. When did “we the people” become “me the person?” Your ideal world sounds 10x more ghoulish than mine. It sounds like barbarism.</p>

        <p>Even if it were possible to lockdown a country with 100% compliance and eradicate a disease within it's borders it's a fools errand because we're surrounded on all sides by areas outside of our jurisdiction with community spread.  If you need an example see new Zealand.</p>

        <p>This is why its become political. We did flatten the curve. The healthcare system is not overloaded. Now the proposition is that we all have to take these measures just to avoid getting sick, which is unprecedented.</p>

        <p>In the US at least, there was near war-time mobilization to take care of an exponential curve. Look up the giant medical ships mobilized but also the millions invested in temporary hospitals that barely got to treat any patients even in New York, allegedly one of the worst hit areas.</p>
