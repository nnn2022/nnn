    <strong>The Problems With A Vaccine Passport</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing that fucking despotic, diaper-shitting Alzheimer's-riddled puppet's totalitarian tweet saying "get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do" pretty much confirmed what we all knew was going to happen: vaccine passports are going to be implemented in some form or another unless people fight back against this shit. They are going to try very hard to segregate us and make life even more difficult for those of us who aren't complying. Here are several reasons why this is completely dystopian and illogical:</p>
<p><strong>NOT EVERYONE CAN GET THE VACCINE</strong></p>
<p>Should they be punished for whatever medical condition or allergy they have? I thought these were the people we were meant to be protecting? I guess you only care about them when the media tells you to, but that's been pretty evident throughout this fucking fiasco. You are turning ramps into stairs and telling those affected by it "iTs fOr yOuR oWn gOoD aNd SaFeTy!"</p>
<p>Simply put, it's ableist and discriminatory.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IF THE APP DOESN'T WORK OR YOU FORGET YOUR PAPERS?</strong></p>
<p>Scenario A: you're stood outside Tesco's gawping at your phone or the QR code scanner, guppy-mouthed and brows-furrowed as the App or whatever the fuck you're using fails to scan or register your Linda McCartney sausage-fingers swiping and tapping furiously down at it like a confused gorilla. So you go to get your vaccination papers but...</p>
<p>Scenario B: you spend a good ten minutes frantically rummaging around your bag, profusely apologizing to the acne-faced teen manning the door as the line behind you grows longer and more irate, breathing down your neck and tutting loudly. Eventually you realize you fucked up and left your papers at home so you have to drive all the way back home to get it and back again. Seems ludicruous, doesn't it? THAT'S CAUSE IT FUCKING IS.</p>
<p><strong>THE VACCINE IS ONLY BENEFICIAL TO THE PERSON WHO RECIEVES IT</strong></p>
<p>That's if it works as advertised, anyway. Your precious Fauci ouchie reduces the symptoms of the virus. That's it. You can still catch and spread the virus. Ergo, a vaccine passport is fucking USELESS. The implementation of such a system would be purely for control and punishment purposes. I can't believe I have to explain something so fucking obvious, but this IS clown world and common sense fucking flew the coop ages ago.</p>
<p><strong>GRAN HAS HAD THE VACCINE NOW</strong></p>
<p>See above. If you truly believe in the vaccines then Gran is protected from the virus. Either that or she's one of the few that CAN'T get it so is fucked either way as both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can spread it to her and if you put this system in place she fucking starves to death or rots in her nursing home for the remainder of her days. Let her fucking live her last few years in peace, you've abused her enough at this point.</p>
<p>P.S. I hope she takes you out of the fucking will.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES IT END?</strong></p>
<p>You let them do this and you've effectively surrendered whatever scrap of privacy and freedom you have remaining after the fucking shit-show that was this past year. It sets a very, very dangerous precedent. What's to stop them demanding you getting another vaccine or medical treatment for something else so you can carry on enjoying your "freedom"? Businesses and the like will be able to pick and choose who can enter or use their facilities based on whatever criteria they like, medical or otherwise.</p>
<p>"Oh, says here on this fucking APP that you're HIV-positive? Well, sorry, we don't cater to YOUR KIND here."</p>
<p>Imagine... fucking IMAGINE the uproar that would happen.</p></p>

        <p>They <em>intend</em> to be discriminatory about the vaccine, and the passports. If you can’t get the vaccine (but want to because you’re a brainwashed masochist), then too bad. If you can’t afford to have a smartphone to download the app, too bad (they’re not going to accept “easily forged” papers, anyway).</p>
<p>If the people don’t have any bread, let them eat cake. If they aren’t able bodied and monied, let them starve to death. It’ll reduce the population, after all. </p>
<p>At least that’s what the elites think.</p>

        <p>100%. The only thing we have left is our determination to stop this. Do not participate! </p>
<p>Its amazing how many people still don't understand what this is about, and equally amazing how many know fine well but do nothing. They will all be held to account.</p>
