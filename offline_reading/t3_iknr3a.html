    <strong>Influenza deaths per year vs. COVID19</strong>
    <p><p>The other day someone was asking about influenza versus pneumonia deaths per year, and I wanted to share that information, because it is often combined.</p>
<p>In 2017, there were <strong>6515</strong> cases of death directly related to influenza, per the vital statistics data provided by the CDC:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09_tables-508.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1XgCY30_5LY8DZRyi6dKDz9qk3x_UDSDrdHTETqEpurXQW_caqaCjfY2E">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr68/nvsr68_09_tables-508.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1XgCY30_5LY8DZRyi6dKDz9qk3x_UDSDrdHTETqEpurXQW_caqaCjfY2E</a></p>
<p>(Page 31 is where this information appears.)</p>
<p>Every year we hear that 30,000-60,000 people die of influenza each year in the US, but this is simply entirely true. If you look back through other VSS for the last ten years, the numbers are also quite similar, for deaths strictly related to influenza. (You will notice pneumonia deaths are higher.) </p>
<p>Compare this to the data that the CDC released the other day about those dying OF COVID versus WITH COVID, and I think you'll see similar data reporting discrepancies.</p></p>

        <p>The CDC 6% didn't indicate died <em>of</em> covid versus <em>with</em> or <em>assumed with</em> covid. That number is unknown and you'll likely never know because of how deaths were included. You'll never know how many died <em>of</em> covid or had covid actually as a contributing cause of their death.</p>
<p>You can't compare influenza to covid anywhere in the world as the deaths were determined differently.</p>
<p>Actually even influenza over there isn't accurate since after age 18 there's no official reporting system and its very much estimated.</p>

        <p>Actually if you would read the post, I am not comparing the two diseases, but how they are REPORTED. They are reported in a similar manner that is not truthful, and this is and was the point I was making. </p>
<p>I could care less if the two diseases are identical. What I care about is infactual data being given and shared with the public.</p>
