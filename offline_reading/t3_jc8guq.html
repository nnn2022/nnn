        <p>Not only incapable of independent thought but angrily forcing their authoritarian views on others. It's shocking to me, and honestly pretty terrifying.</p>
<p>I often compare what's going on today to two well-known psych experiments:  Milgram's authority obediance experiments and Zimbardo's Stanford prison experiment. </p>
<p>Not long after WWII, Milgram wanted to see how many "regular" people would follow authority even when it meant causing grave harm or worse to the "learner" who didn't answer correctly.  Prior to his experiment, the prediction was that only a very small percentage of "teachers" would cause physical harm to the "learner."  In the experiments that he and others performed across the globe, the results were that anywhere from 30% to 90% would indeed follow authority and inflict harm.  Milgram's experiment, considered "controversial" today by ethics boards, also garnered criticism when he said that "a common psychological process is centrally involved in both" his lab experiments and the events of Nazi Germany.  Oh boy, people didn't like to hear that!  He was correct, of course, but speaking truth isn't often well-received.</p>
<p>Philip Zimbardo wanted to study the effects of power (authority) in the Stanford prison experiment.  He took a group of student volunteers and grouped some as "guards" and some as "prisoners."  He found that each group quickly acclimated to their roles, with the "guards" mentally and verbally abusing the "prisoners" in a sadistic manner, and the "prisoners" suffering psychological damage from this abuse.  This study is also controversial today, mainly because Zimbardo allegedly did not follow up on long-term damage to the "prisoners."  The study is said to have lasted only 6 days at which point Zimbardo stopped it due to the sadistic authoritarianism of the "guards" and the damage to the "prisoners" but I suspect it lasted longer than this.  </p>
<p>Today I see a disturbing combination of both studies.  Blind obedience to authority, abuse of authority, and abuse of those who reject or even question these authoritarian measures.  From a psychological perspective, I find today's events truly terrifying particularly when governments are now openly talking about "camps".  This will not end well.</p>

        <p>This really goes parallel the studies you've mentioned and that's scary. I don't understand how it all works from a psych. perspective but it is absolutely true the majority will always blindly follow authority.</p>
<p>What catches me though is that the majority of the group yelling BLM (which of course they do!) and encouraging violence against police are the SAME ONES saying to just follow orders/mandates regarding this pandemic.
Why are they against one type of authority to the point of violence <em>but</em> want violence against those that are against the type of authority they DO want ? </p>
<p>Of course the above is a generalization of a group and not all involved in one side or the other support both.</p>
<p>I really am afraid for my family but we'll stand our ground as long and hard as we can, I'm mentally prepared to go underground if need be though. I feel like a conspiracy theorist even mentioning such a drastic thing - as if I'm expecting zombies to attack or some shit - but I can't help but still feel the absolute panic of how to keep my kids safe in such a life if we have to.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely correct in mentioning BLM and authority.  I made the same observation the other day on a reddit sub, and the person I was replying to simply did not understand my point:   there are protests <em>against</em> the abuse of authority, so why in the world would you give <em>more</em> authority to the state and blindly follow its edicts?  The person simply did not grasp this incongruity as was quite evident by his or her replies.</p>
<p>Just keep your family safe, particularly the children.  The world today is in no way "normal", and I hate seeing children being forced to think it is.  I've lost count of how many young people I have heard talk about hopelessness, depression, feeling "trapped" or like a "prisoner", and even talk of suicide - far more than I did pre-covid. No doubt adults feel this way too but are more accustomed to suppressing their feelings and disagreements with authority to get by at work and in life.</p>

<p>Saying BLM and wanting more police accountability is not the same thing as trusting scientific sources.</p>
<p>I can both say that police need to wear body cams and they can't turn them off.</p>
<p>And also agree with scientists that smoking causes cancer and government should limit smoking exposure.</p>
<p>&rt;saying to just follow orders/mandates regarding this pandemic.</p>
<p>I am not a virology expert, I didn't study COVID-19 and I don't have the knowledge to. There is widespread support from people who are, who did and have this knowledge to social distance, wear masks and other measures.</p>

        <p>The majority of us also have the immune system to survive COVID with flying colors, so we should.</p>
<p>I agree that police need held accountable but many people are calling for outright violence against them because of how out of line they are... But then turn around and want to follow the iron fist straight to the bread line because "they say it's best" .. I mean they also say it's okay for police to murder us and you're telling them to fuck right off with that shit (because obvious) so you're going to blindly follow either everything they say or you gotta think for yourself in full.</p>
<p>There is a long line for experts disagreeing with the few scientists that have such a hold on everyone but these people do not want to hear it because it doesn't fit into their box.. and the ones everyone wants to listen to look at nothing <em>but</em> the physical health up against COVID. They aren't weighing anything but "X COVID deaths:NO COVID deaths" ..that's literally all they look at, talk about, pay attention to.
Yes, social distancing and properly used masks will help slow the spread of COVID ! Shutting the economy down so no one leaves thei house is absolutely going to slow the spread ! There's zero way to deny that because if you aren't together or are properly masking up with a proper mask when you are then yeah - obviously because that's how it works... but that's <em>all</em> they care about. 
They don't care about the mental wellbeing, financial wellbeing, physical wellbeing beyond "no Covid"</p>

        <p>&rt; The majority of us also have the immune system to survive COVID with flying colors, so we should.</p>
<p>Even if this is true which I don't agree that it is. It is morally wrong to sentence people with pre existing conditions to die because people would rather not wear their masks, social distance and go to parties.</p>
<p>&rt;so you're going to blindly follow either everything they say or you gotta <strong>think for yourself in full.</strong></p>
<p>I am thinking for myself, and realising I don't have all the answers. I need to defer to other people.</p>
<p>&rt;There is a long line for experts disagreeing with the few scientists that have such a hold on everyone but these people do not want to hear it because it doesn't fit into their box</p>
<p>I disagree, if there were more experts disagreeing than agreeing no one would be locked down wearing masks or social distancing at all.</p>
<p>The economy and everything got shut down because nothing was done. Most places ignored COVID-19 until it was just too late. Then all they could do to stop it was completely halt everything. Which is obviously horrible. But that happened because people ignored the problem until it hit us.</p>
<p>The same reason there are still horrible lock downs and such. Because people can't be reasonable and wear masks or social distance or moderate their social circles.</p>
<p>&rt;They don't care about the mental wellbeing, financial wellbeing, physical wellbeing beyond "no Covid"</p>
<p>Imma be brutally honest here, that is a failure of your government and has nothing to do with COVID-19. If your government did not provide adequate financial support, mental support, healthcare or provide for other such needs then it is failing regardless.</p>

        <p>The majority of us also have the immune system to survive COVID with flying colors, so we should.</p>
<p>I agree that police need held accountable but many people are calling for outright violence against them because of how out of line they are... But then turn around and want to follow the iron fist straight to the bread line because "they say it's best" .. I mean they also say it's okay for police to murder us and you're telling them to fuck right off with that shit (because obvious) so you're going to blindly follow either everything they say or you gotta think for yourself in full.</p>
<p>There is a long line for experts disagreeing with the few scientists that have such a hold on everyone but these people do not want to hear it because it doesn't fit into their box.. and the ones everyone wants to listen to look at nothing <em>but</em> the physical health up against COVID. They aren't weighing anything but "X COVID deaths:NO COVID deaths" ..that's literally all they look at, talk about, pay attention to.
Yes, social distancing and properly used masks will help slow the spread of COVID ! Shutting the economy down so no one leaves thei house is absolutely going to slow the spread ! There's zero way to deny that because if you aren't together or are properly masking up with a proper mask when you are then yeah - obviously because that's how it works... but that's <em>all</em> they care about. 
They don't care about the mental wellbeing, financial wellbeing, physical wellbeing beyond "no Covid"</p>

        <p>See, how does that train of thought make any sense?  Of course those against the iron fist are the ones who hid the Jews while those who followed the fists hunted the Jews and/or turned in their neighbors.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  I would say that those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it but it seems that even when they know history it's warped to align with cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>Here's the original post, from Removeddit:</p>
<p>&rt; Because of the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing has become mandatory in many places. Here in the Netherlands, if you do not keep 1.5 meters distance from people outside of your household, you can get a fine and a note on your criminal record.
&rt; 
&rt; Forcing people to physically distance is criminal. Never in the 200.000 years that humanity has existed have people been forced to do this. Natural social behavior is now not only discouraged but illegal. Since this has never been done before, nobody can know what the long term effects will be on people's mental and physical wellbeing. Therefore people are being subjected to a medical experiment without their consent. That is a violation of the Nuremberg Code.</p>

        <p>Its also a crime under US law, it is illegal for the government to enforce this, yet unlike us the common folk when we break their random aribtrary laws like not wearing a mask, which is a right yet still get punished for it, they do not get punished for breaking actual laws and we finance all of it with our taxes, and failure to pay will result in guess what?
