        <p>My mom has stage 4 breast cancer. I wouldn‚Äôt say she ‚Äúshrugs‚Äù off the virus, because she hardly has the energy to do the things anymore anyways...but she and my dad live close by, and they still came over for Thanksgiving. She also took my kids to the mall for their birthdays. </p>
<p>Her thought process is, that her days are already numbered, so how would she feel if she  spent her last year or so on this earth without her kinds and grandkids. And I can‚Äôt say I blame her.</p>

        <p>Coronaviruses cause the common cold and the majority of us have come into contact with them in the past and have t-cell immunity already, things like sunlight (vitamin D), zinc are also important to stay healthy and boost the immune system but yes, we locked the country down and decimated the economy and small businesses over the flu with a 99.7% recovery rate...

        <p>Well it‚Äôs cause it does have a 99.997 to 99.999 survival rate. You can have health problems and be unhealthy, but still got a decent amount of life to live somehow. Or you could be on deaths door as is and Covid is the final nail in the coffin. But anything at that point could finish you off, hell you could fart too fuckin hard and give yourself a heart attack, but they need their numbers.</p>

        <p>It's literally a meme: </p>
<p>Only plague in history where you have to watch the news to know people are dying.  So deadly you need a test to know you have it.</p>
<p>The only pandemic is the stupidity and gullibility pandemic. </p>
<p>My only hope is that the vaccine is given to doomers first, that will help toward solving the problem.</p>

        <p>Yes i know a 92 yo man who had mild symptoms and is healthy now, but i also know a 42 absolutely healthy man who died "from it"? I don't really know what happened since he suddenly had low oxygen levels and got tested positive then doctors told him he should've went to the hospital earlier because he was suffering from acute pneumonia "due to covid(?)" and he died. I have no clue about what happened there.</p>

        <p>Asthmatic under poor control even while on daily steroids, epileptic, and have severe allergies that require I carry an epipen at all times. Caught COVID and was the most mild illness I‚Äôve had in over a decade. Beat it in 3 days.

        <p>My husband worked with someone who is male, in his late 30s I think?, overweight and diabetic and survived. He said he just got winded real easily and didn't have a lot of energy. 
Talked to an older cashier at Wamart who is in her 60s or 70s and said she had it, had to be hospitalized, and after a couple of weeks still felt drained. 
Talked to a Nurse Practioner at an urgent care I had to take my granddaughter to for a busted lip and she said she had it and almost died.</p>
