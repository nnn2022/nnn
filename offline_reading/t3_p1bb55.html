    <strong>I spent like an hour writing this reply to someone in another thread and I'd like your thoughts on it as well. I try not to seek external validation but sometimes I feel like I'm crazy for suggesting that long term studies are important.</strong>
    <p><p>I am more than happy to share my views. Thank you for being willing to listen. A few things I want to get out of the way first, I’m 23 years old. I am not an expert in anything. I don’t claim to be and don’t try to be. If anything I’d say that I know enough to be sure that I don’t know anything. I should also mention that I have always had a general distrust to the government/media/authority telling me what to do without question. </p>
<p>That being said I do have some thoughts on everything. </p>
<p>Why long term studies? </p>
<p>Vaccines (and pharmaceuticals in general) typically go through a lengthy approval process. From initial research to three phases of trials with various standards and expectations. The majority of medications do not make it past Phase I of their respective studies. This source says 7.9% have a likelihood of approval (1). I have had difficulty finding a reference for how long the average vaccine takes, but out of all pharmaceuticals the average is 10.5 years (1). </p>
<p>Now the majority of that time the leaders of these programs are fighting for funding, interest, good trial participation, and other hurdles. The covid-19 vaccine clearly did not have those hurdles. This is a disease that needs to be contained so funding is abundant, volunteers are everywhere, and the need is very evident. Money can solve a lot of problems, but it cannot make time move faster. mRNA vaccines are new, plain and simple. There has never been one like it to be mass produced and distributed like the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. </p>
<p>Yes, there has been previous research on mRNA vaccines and their potential to protect against different viruses and diseases. So why is it that the covid-19 vaccines are the first mRNA vaccines to be produced? From my understanding, we do not have past trials to confirm the long term safety and efficacy of these vaccines. Based on our understanding of mRNA and the other components of the vaccine scientist believe that it is safe. That is a good reason to begin trials and carefully track the results and potential effects. I do not believe that is a reason to mass produce, speed through FDA approval, and even mandate the vaccine for participation in society. </p>
<p>The FDA requires at least 2-months of safety data to approve Emergency Use Authorization for a vaccine (2). Pfizer and Moderna collected this data in their combined Phase I/II trials. The main concern here is that these vaccines has not been used before. We know what to expect with other types of vaccines such as subunit, live, and inactivated vaccines (3). I view this 2 months of safety data to be more applicable to more traditional vaccines because there is clear evidence that if there are severe adverse effects they will show themselves in the first 2 months. We do not know this to be true of mRNA vaccines. There is no history, there is no precedent to turn to. The mRNA vaccines are <em>probably</em> fine, but with the abundance of anecdotal reports of adverse reactions, an overflowing number of submission to VAERS, and the immense pressure that everyone is under to just get something passed through, I have a difficult time believe that everyone truly did their due diligence. On top of that, there is so much money involved in all of this. Money corrupts people. I believe the scientists and researchers are doing their best for society. I do not believe that the CEOs of Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, and the top government officials overlooking all of this are impartial. </p>
<p>(I will fully admit that the end of my argument there moves away from the science and more towards politics, but I still think that it is a factor into why the vaccines have been approved so quickly.)</p>
<p>We also do not know much about the long lasting efficacy of the vaccine. Do two doses give life time immunity for the majority? We don’t know, shots haven’t been in arms long enough. But the number of breakthrough cases are rising so perhaps not. Side note, the CDC is no longer tracking all breakthrough cases. Only those that end in hospitalization and death. (4) I think that to know the true efficacy of these vaccines we need concrete numbers of the breakthrough cases and how severe they are compared to regular infections. And did you know that in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials, they only counted cases as positive if they received a positive molecular test AND had at least one symptom? (5, pg14 and 6, pg15) So even if the vaccine reduces symptoms, how is it effective at preventing the spread if it does not stop a person from being infected? To me this suggests that we need to spend more time studying these vaccines.</p>
<p>I’m also concerned about how the vaccines effect the variants and future mutations. I might be totally off base here, but all I can think of is could it be similar to bacterial resistance. Could the amount of transmission between vaccinate people, regardless of how small, give rise to stronger and more resistant mutations? </p>
<p>I will say though, that I agree the vaccine is the right choice for some people. The CFR for the elderly is extremely high and the vaccine clearly provides some sort of protection. I’m not against the vaccine altogether, I’m concerned that no one is considering the potential long term effects in younger people. At this point it should be available to those who want it but there is absolutely no reason for it to be mandated. </p>
<p>Immediate Solutions:</p>
<p>This is a tough one. I spent a lot of today thinking about it because I do want to give a well thought out answer. </p>
<p>I believe that personal responsibility is a big part of this. If you feel unsafe, take the precautions you deem necessary to stay safe. Isolate, social distance, masks, hand washing, all the things. You are not responsible for someone else’s actions. The government is not responsible for someone else’s actions. Each choice we make has associated risks, the same is true with covid. There are ways to gauge if you are likely to be exposed if you participate in an activity. Let people make their own choice on that.</p>
<p>I know a lot of people who don’t actually mind the masks or the social distancing but they are just unsure of the vaccine. Over time it’s built into resentment for only hearing about the pandemic and the vaccine. I think that if more information was available about what to do about covid that did not mention the vaccine, people would be more willing to listen. (I’m thinking like “how to treat covid at home” “what to do when a loved on has covid” “vitamins and minerals to help you stay healthy” “wash your hands”) I also think that the stigma and shame that is brought down on people who test positive adds to an overall negative view of the people who heavily promote the vaccines, which then influences how people think of the vaccine. </p>
<p>Treatments. I think that there needs to be an equal focus on treatments for covid. People don’t want the vaccine yet? That’s okay, here’s how to treat if you catch it and here’s how to know when you need medical attention. I know that the doctors and nurses are exhausted, that’s why we need to spend more time on effective treatments that reduce a person’s chance in the hospital. </p>
<p>Again, not anti-vax here, just very cautious and very distrusting of the government and big pharma in general. I’ll probably get vaccinated in the future, but I still want to wait it out. And I’m curious to learn more about Novavax. </p>

        <p>I'll post my go-to resources.</p>
<p>Premises: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No one is seeking to discount that there have been promising and tangible developments in mRNA vaccines over recent years. The question is whether enough historical safety concerns have been solved in these jabs to apply indiscriminately across the entire population. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not only about long-term effects, but understanding which populations have any adverse effect and WHY, which we don’t know. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The argument is not to try to prevent other people from taking the vaccine, but defending people’s right to opt out. Especially young and healthy individuals with almost no risk from covid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguing that any medical treatment be forced on someone puts the burden of proof on the coercing party to provide evidence of safety; it should be enough that a person has the right to deny any medical treatment, so “reasonable doubt” is more than enough reason to refuse, especially with safety data that indicates we should proceed with caution and have reason to be skeptical. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As of 2016, no lipid nano particle-mRNA (LNP) vaccines had ever been tested in humans because of “unanswered questions,” and also because--this is important--the tolerance for side effects in healthy individuals is very low. In other words, with cancer patients who are already dying, doctors will do more experimental treatments to try to save a life, but they don't want to put an already healthy person at greater risk. Note that the corona vaccines have mRNA wrapped in LNP in order to deliver the code through the body’s defenses. </p>
<p>See the 2016 study "mRNA vaccine delivery using lipid nanoparticles" for details (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/).</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the best arguments against forced vaccination with experimental medical treatments has to do with historically known side effects from previous attempts at mRNA vaccinations, which all failed.</p>
<p>The peer-reviewed medical papers below share about historically known adverse side effects from attempts at mRNA vaccination that were SUPPOSED to be addressed before experimenting on large portions of the population. It's ironic how all the adverse side effects being reported JUST HAPPEN to be the same side effects that medical journals were warning about BEFORE the pandemic. </p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p>• “mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology,” a study less than two years old at the time of the outbreak. https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243</p>
<p>• “Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines induce potent T follicular helper and germinal center B cell responses” from summer of 2018 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/</p>
<p>• “A Comparison of Plasmid DNA and mRNA as Vaccine Technologies” , one of the most recent major pre-COVID medical studies about this published in June 2019, and provides a clear overview of vaccines technologies as recent as six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 case. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631684/</p>
<p>Selections from the above sources:</p>
<p>• Ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment are the only mRNA treatments that have been effective in the past, and as of 2019, scientists had not figured out how to make in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments (the current vaccines) effective or without safety concerns. </p>
<p>• Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery.</p>
<p>• The majority of past investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficiency of in vitro delivery.</p>
<p>• The instability of mRNA has been a significant reason for the lack of interest in mRNA as a drug in the past.</p>
<p>• mRNA vaccines are inflammatory in nature which increases risk for toxicity.</p>
<p>• A possible concern is that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce responses which have been associated not only with inflammation but also with autoimmunity.</p>
<p>• mRNA inhibition of antigen can have negative immune responses.</p>
<p>• The immune system response has the potential to be harmful – RNA has long been known to be an immunologically active molecule, and mRNA has a number of immunostimulatory mechanisms, which may be detrimental for mRNA used for vaccines.</p>
<p>• Recent human trials (pre COVID) have demonstrated both moderate and severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms. </p>
<p>• While some preclinical studies have generated optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two of the more recent clinical reports led to more tempered expectations. In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, and the side effects were not trivial.</p>
<p>• Liver toxicity was observed in pre-clinical studies with one potential mRNA therapeutic delivered in lipid nanoparticles for Crigler-Najjar syndrome… These were serious enough to halt the work with this particular entity.</p>
<p>• This observed toxicity may be concerning for vaccines as well, since even live replicating viruses and viral vector vaccines (which generally are more immunogenic than subunit vaccines) need repeat dosing</p>
<p>• There were reported toxicities seen with the rabies mRNA vaccine that included limited systemic adverse effects (AEs) for the majority of patients (78%) and even grade three AEs in ~10% of patients following doses of mRNA via different routes. This was despite the conclusions from early studies showing that this vaccine was generally thought to be safe.</p>
<p>• Known potential safety concerns that have been identified as needing to be evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies (as of six months before the first case of COVID) include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local and systemic inflammation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>• Another potential safety issue derives from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination, which has been shown to contribute to oedema [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
<p>• Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]</p>
<p>• There are nine areas that scientists have noted need continued research and development for mRNA vaccines, as well as nine “Issues to be addressed for clinical efficacy and safety of mRNA related to inflammation,” including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Potential toxicity of mRNA due to inherent mRNA inflammatory activity, use of unnatural modified nucleoside, and the formulations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Several pathways of RNA-induced inflammation: TLR 3, 7, 8, plus cytoplasmic pathways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Known toxicities of drugs containing unnatural modified nucleosides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Potential mitigation or enhancement due to formulation of the mRNA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Will anti-self RNA antibodies be generated and play any role in autoimmune diseases?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Design of clinical trials to detect inflammation/toxicity due to mRNA”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The general conclusion of all these studies?</p>
<p>"Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</p>
<p>Most studies that have been done have only sought to show that the vaccines are effective compared to not having a vaccine. I've looked and found hardly any research proving the safety of the vaccines, especially in regards to these known concerns that all the experts have warned about. The safety reports that have been provided are from the manufacturer to the FDA, so it would require FOIA requests to access.</p>
