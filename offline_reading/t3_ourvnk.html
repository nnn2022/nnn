        <p>&rt;CDC is confirming that the current Covid-19 vaccines are not working effectively against Covid-19</p>
<p>Strong language after showing a report where 346 vaccinated adults got infected and only 4 (1.2%) ended up hospitalized.  </p>
<p>Odd that I'd draw the conclusion that they were working as intended from the same data. Also the study linked has this little line. </p>
<p>&rt;The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible (1); vaccination is the most important strategy to prevent severe illness and death.</p>
<p>And of course it has the disclaimer at the bottom of the report</p>
<p>&rt;First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak.</p>
<p>She's all like "let me draw conclusions from this report!".</p>
