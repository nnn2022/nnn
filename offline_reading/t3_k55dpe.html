    <strong>“Defying Hitler” A comparison of our times vs the rise of Nazi Germany</strong>
    <p><p>This is an analysis of the parallels between our times and the book “Defying Hitler”, a first person account of the rise of Nazi Germany by Sebastian Haffner. I would like to start by saying that, of course, we have not reached the level of cruelty and authoritarianism as the nazis. Rather, our situation bears a stark resemblance to the rise of Hitler and the nazi party.</p>
<p>The main parallels include extreme political polarization, complete takeover of the press, forced compliance through shaming and intimidation and the passivity of the general public.</p>
<p>After the collapse, humiliation and financial ruin of Prussia in WW1, there was an intense and violent struggle between the left wing socialists and the right wing fascists. Haffners account makes it clear that the socialists could have come out on top, they were certainly engaging in violent rebellion (against the generally passive and liberal Weimar Republic) and at one point had actually taken the major government buildings. It wasn’t until Hitlers infamous “Night of the long knives” in which every socialist that could be identified was systemically murdered, along with their families, that the Nazis actually came out on top. </p>
<p>In summary, extreme political polarization on both sides prefaces brutal, totalitarian governments. Parallels can also be drawn to Soviet Russia and Maoist China. While we may have not even close to that level of partisan violence in the US today, there have been regular street brawls and intense animosity building between both sides for years, creating a feedback loop of radicalism. The superior military and surveillance capabilities of the state also prevent partisan violence. If the state did not possess these capabilities, there would certainly be overtly violent partisan conflict occurring.</p>
<p>Haffner details the gradual transformation of all newspapers in print, which presented a variety of political views, to complete Nazi controlled propaganda. First through intimidation, newspapers began to become more and more sympathetic towards the Nazis. Eventually this escalated into vandalism and violence towards papers that printed anything opposing them. Finally, even the names of newspapers were changed and any dissident writer/editor was disposed of and replaced with Nazis. Everything in print was designed from top down to promote the views of the party. </p>
<p>Today, the gradual process of corruption of mainstream media into the much more insidious and covert manipulation of social media, is essentially the same process. Complete control over the flow of information, manipulated to shape public opinion towards supporting the establishment.</p>
<p>The infamous example of public shaming in Nazi Germany is when Jews were forced to wear the Star of David on their clothing, this eventually escalated into overt intimidation. The party especially attracted young men in the beginning, they were encouraged to shame anyone who associated with Jews. Jewish business were first labeled with signs that encouraged customers not to patronize the business and eventually party members would physically assault customers and vandalize the businesses, before they were eventually boarded up and shut down. Later, Nazis would march down the streets and anyone who did not salute them would be beaten, sometimes to death.</p>
<p>Gradual forced compliance bears all too much resemblance to our times. First you must stay home for 2 weeks, then you must wear a mask, then you must socially distance, then you must not see your family for holidays, then you must take a vaccine. Then what? Public shaming quickly escalated to intimidation, people screaming ridicule at the non compliant and police dragging them out of stores. We need only look at our friends on the popular subs to see that some are already frothing at the mouth to beat and murder us for resisting.</p>
<p>Lastly, the most poignant message of the book is the complete passivity of the vast majority of citizens while this process took place. The author was in the equivalent of law school and his father a judge. He details how he continued to keep his head down, go to class and study for his exams while the party slowly encroached on his pursuit. First they came into the library and started removing certain books, declaring that this or that law was no longer law, then dragging professors who they deemed a threat right out of class and eventually just taking away all the books from students and giving them Nazi propaganda, insisting they study and learn that.
The author eventually ends up getting dragged to a camp where he is coerced to wear a Nazi uniform and start training for warfare. He even admits that it was one of the best times of his life even though he knew how evil the Nazis were.</p>
<p>The passivity of the public today cannot be understated, most of us feel completely powerless to what is taking place and would rather focus on our individual lives than try to fight back, myself included. </p>
<p>To conclude, I would like readers to know that I read this book over 2 years ago, this is just what I remember off the top of my head. I am completely open to anyone correcting any inaccuracies I made or jumbled facts.</p></p>

        <p>Good comparison, and key lessons to be learned. It is better to act during the Weimar Republic days even if the totalitarian takeover is unlikely or unclear, than wait till the party is in power.</p>

        <p>I keep thinking of 1930s Germany and how it must have felt compared to today. I ve been  looking for books to read on the matter. Thanks for the recommendation and write up.</p>

        <p>You know, I always imagined what it would be like if I were in the faction that rose to power in some nation. But I never considered what it would be like to be on the opposition or the neutral party if a different faction took over.</p>

        <p>The divisions between people during this has been straight up scary... I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. People losing friends and family over not wearing masks, public shaming on a crazy scale and just so much hostility. </p>
<p>It’s honestly like the mainstream media has brainwashed these people and they can only repeat what they’ve heard. I’m part of an “anti oppression” group and they shared some graphic that was like “How to deal with Covid deniers” or basically just anyone questioning the lockdowns. This graph straight up said that anyone questioning all this has a mental disorder &amp; “needs help”. </p>
<p>When I commented saying that’s completely unfair and actually loads of people have doubts / don’t agree but just won’t say it publicly- I was informed by the group that I needed to “pick my side” and anyone who agreed with the protests / anti lockdowners is “helping the far right” succeed. Even when I told them that I know plenty of people who think this is all bullshit who aren’t far right They still wouldn’t listen. </p>
<p>They kept insisting anti lockdowners are racist (which is just bizarre af bc I’m not white and neither are my anti lockdown friends). Even when I brought up the fact that people of colour at anti lockdown protests were being beaten up by police all they could say was “600 people have died from Covid today”. </p>
<p>I’ve never experienced anything like this and it’s terrfying. They have no individual, independent thought. The way they speak is as if we’re engaged in some kind of war with clear and defined “sides”. I told them that most people protesting lockdown are just angry bc they’ve lost their jobs, homes, etc and people are worried about the surveillance state and increasing police presence. Apparently that’s not a good enough reason to protest. </p>
<p>I honestly wonder what the future holds.</p>

        <p>The only thing you missed was that the national socialists were a sect of left wing totalitarian socialists. The difference between Hitlers Fascism and Communism is one is National, the other International.</p>

        <p>I’m familiar with the the argument that national socialism is left wing. That is based on a view of left and right as they are understood in the modern USA. Historically, free markets vs state controlled economy is not what defines left and right. Many right wing movements around the world are not free market at all.</p>

        <p>Spot on about people being passive. The only reasonable action I can see is to leave the country entirely. Who is going to fight the loyalist's rebellion? There are hardly any patriots of honor to be had.</p>
