        <p>Yeah, I know. But dude I swear, my online classes freaking suck balls. I have to stay all day home in front of a computer and plus I don't have any friends. Right when I decided to change and to open myself up to people in order to have a healthier social life, this pandemic hit and now I'm just not able to do so anymore. It's fucking pathetic. It's fucking pathetic that people are STILL complying with this bullshit.</p>
<p>I did meet a girl at a job I managed to have for a while, but she was so fucking paranoid of the covid thing she even wore the mask at her car and at home... Like WHAT THE FUCK??? She never left her house because she was very concerned about the whole covid scam.</p>
<p>This is utter bullshit man. I cannot tolerate this anymore. I do appreciate that I've had time to do my favorite readings, but at this point I need to meet people, I need to make friends and I want concerts to come back... I desperately need to socialize more before I turn into a lunatic who is not able to socialize normally... Fuck it I'll say it: i want to meet girls as well... I normally don't admit that but fuck it, I said it, I want to meet them... I don't want to be shy anymore</p>

        <p>I mean yeah, but I don't like to think that every girl that believes the covid scam isn't worth my time... I found that girl that I mentioned to be pretty and I kind of liked her, but then I stopped working at that place and her mother, that also worked there, didn't allow her to leave the house because of the covid thing, and she complied with it.... Dude for real I want to meet women. I'm sorry but I'm desperate in solitude right now... And just when I decide to stop being an insecure and shy guy that always loses his opportunities with women because of himself this pandemic hits... Oh man fuck</p>

<p>Also, stop apologizing for wanting to meet women, that's what men do.  Why would you apologize for that?</p>

        <p>Fuck I apologized probably because our fellow americans have become so fucking sensitive over "toxic masculinity" that you never know when someone will freak out over a straight guy talking about women. It's weird, and people don't want to admit that the overuse (and misuse) of technology is destroying our human warmth.. I'm sorry about your experience man... This covid thing has definitely fucked our lives</p>

        <p>"Toxic masculinity " is one of my pet peeves.  Today's men produce a quarter of the sperm their grandfather's did.  We are basically domesticating ourselves and committing epigenetic castration.</p>
<p>Most offenders of "toxic masculinity " are decidedly un-masculine dudes.</p>

        <p>You seek to not understand the meaning if categorically different.  Believing that the natural state of a human being can never be illegal, and believing that a disease less dangerous than flu, in no way shape or form indicates I support murdering unborn children.</p>
<p>Nice try though.  Also, it's poor form to make a statement in regards to a comment on an entirely different sub because you went through my post history.  This could have been quoted in r/prolife</p>

        <p>The thing is... I don't even wear it because I don't even leave my home except for jogging at night (I obviously don't wear it) and to get some groceries every now and then (i do need to wear it otherwise I won't be able to buy food)... It's ridiculous. Last time I went to the city, I saw everyone outside social distancing and wearing masks, but people at restaurants without masks and very close to each other? Lmao they're not even making sense man!! It's utter lunacy at this point. It's utter lunacy and a reality twist</p>

        <p>I feel it, with Spring and Summer on the way it's really starting to burn. So much ruined, they took one year and now they're going for another. Nothing is fun anymore, we haven't seen a normal day in almost a year now. Everywhere you go you're reminded of what is happening and I'm still in shock that it got this far without people going against it past the very beginning when it started to become very obvious what was going on. Hope is a double edged sword but I don't give up either way.</p>

        <p>I'm 20 as well. More than half of my university life is expected to be just sitting in front of a computer doing horrible zoom classes whilst pouring a fortune into it, I seriously will never forgive anyone who advocates these draconian lockdowns and restrictions.        <br>
It also doesn't help that I study overseas and I haven't been able to enter my school for 1 year and counting due to border closures, all my friends are there and haven't properly met anyone for the entirety of 2020, and probably a large chunk of 2021 :(             <br>
It sucks that our lives are being wasted for a virus that is pretty much harmless to our age group.</p>

        <p>Man I feel just like you do. I freaking despise these horrible Zoom classes, and I'm expected to pay just as much as If I were on campus.... Fucking ridiculous. Zoom classes are so depressing man... You ever get that silence when the professor asks something and nobody says anything because everyone is too shy or caught up doing something else? Dude those silences suck and honestly I get too distracted. I rarely remember the information the professor says. It's fucked</p>

        <p>I remember having a lot of fun during that age, 17-25. It’s a shame young people are getting robbed of some of that once in a lifetime age where life is a big adventure. Now I’m approaching middle and wasn’t exactly going to go wild on spring break this year anyway. But I feel for the people put out of work, school, and life in general for no reason. The data shows the same amount of people were going to pass no matter what. Essentially none of the young and full of life are even at risk.</p>

        <p>A year at 20 is a hell of a lot different than a year when you’re significantly older. This is one of the prime years where you’re establishing a social life, you’re supposed to be out and about enjoying life and dating and living it up with friends and meeting people and traveling. Taking a year of life away from someone at this stage is far different than taking one from someone further down the line. While that’s not to say that older individuals don’t have social lives, they typically aren’t participating in restricted activities, like going to bars and clubs etc, as much as the younger crowds, and college being messed up by all this is far different than having to work from home (although for those who have lost jobs this is clearly also terrible).  At that age your social scene is typically more “set”. For example we have family friends who are not phased by this-the parents are thrilled to have more time at home with their kids, their social lives were the kids’ sports games and wine nights with friends which they’re still doing. Of course everybody is in a different situation but the younger generations are probably in the worst in my opinion.</p>
