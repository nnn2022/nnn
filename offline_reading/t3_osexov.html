    <strong>Pandemic of the Unhealthy</strong>
    <p><p>This COVID "pandemic" has exposed to me not only how the vast majority of people have little critical thinking ability, but also, just how unhealthy a lot of people (at least Americans) are. When you consider the CDC's own statistic published last year that 94% of COVID deaths had some co-morbidity, anyone with one functioning brain cell can deduce that this is a pandemic of the unhealthy, not a pandemic of the unvaccinated (as that one CDC witch Walensky stated).</p>
<p>It's funny that throughout this past year and a half, not one of the "experts" that I have seen paraded out on mainstream media have mentioned a healthy lifestyle as a prevention mechanism to COVID (and other diseases). Not one of eating healthily, limiting alcohol consumption, stopping smoking, getting proper nutrition/vitamins, nor getting sunlight were mentioned by these "experts."</p>
<p>Now, we in NNN know why this is: there is no profitability in people being healthy. Big pharma needs to continue to rake in endless profits by way of drugs as a solution to the problems they've created. More profits will be coming via COVID booster shots (and don't believe for a second when the CDC says they're "unsure" if booster shots are needed; they *WILL* be recommended).</p>
<p>Anyway, this was a mini-rant about how unhealthy America is, and how it's inflating COVID death numbers. Yet we're expected to get vaccinated to protect these people when they won't even take basic measures to protect themselves. Unreal.</p></p>

        <p>Ding ding ding!  A health crisis masked as a pandemic; no better way to target the poor and elderly than a virus that attacks both.  I am pretty connected to all levels of US society and the ones hit hardest were the poor. I am speaking from knowledge of a city in the northeast so the vast majority were people of color. Diabetes runs rampant, along w other health issues that arise from the polluted environments they live in. Funny enough, these were the communities most encouraged to stay inside (not exercise) and rely on doordash or whatever (more processed foods).  The vitamin d deficiency and the toxins like lead that sit beneath their homes had to be a major factor in these high numbers, yet these things were never acknowledged.  </p>
<p>It was hard to try and bring these things up though bc it could come off as judgment, which is not the case bc i am well aware of the struggles that the poor of US cities face, and am disgusted by the plight that they face daily.  Funny enough, most of these hard working folks won’t go near the shots, so their memory has been maintained despite the free internet (programming) that was “gifted”.  </p>
<p>One way or another this darkness got to give</p>
