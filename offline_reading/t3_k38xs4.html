        <p>This is a section from the document.</p>
<p>"In response to the lockdown parity argument above, it might be objected that there is indeed something distinctive about bodily or physical integrity. The idea here is that we cannot in fact compare interference with bodily integrity with interference with other liberties, or that interference with bodily integrity is always worse than interference with other liberties. Our mental health parity argument addresses this objection by reference to mental health law, which permits compulsory interference with bodily integrity.</p>
<p>The criteria for detention under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 require that appropriate treatment for the person’s mental disorder is available and that it is not possible to provide treatment without detention. It is clear that the objective of section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983 is not merely to detain individuals with mental disorder for their own protection or the protection of others, but also to administer treatment for these purposes. Section 63 of the Mental Health Act 1983 permits treatment without consent to persons detained under the Act, even if they possess decision-making capacity.</p>
<p>Mental health law provides an example where the law permits—exceptionally—compulsory interference with a person’s bodily integrity for their own protection and that of others when the nature and degree of their circumstances gives warrant. The case law establishes that compulsory treatment in this context may be compatible with articles 3 and 8 ECHR.[28]</p>
<p>We can argue by analogy from the compatibility with the ECHR of compulsory treatment in mental health law to the human rights law compliance of compulsory vaccination. In the context of highly infectious disease, every person is at risk of infection and a potential threat to the life and health of others—a person’s default state is of a nature and degree to warrant immunisation. Vaccination protects the individual from possible serious harms. Vaccination also contributes to the protection of the community generally and the protection of its vulnerable members specifically.[29] Given vaccine hesitancy, it may be necessary to compel vaccination in order to achieve herd immunity. The justifications for compulsory vaccination map onto the criteria for detention and treatment contained in the Mental Health Act 1983."</p>

        <p>In Canada, there are people with severe mental illnesses and drug addictions living on the streets, in filth and degradation, because it is extremely difficult to force them into treatment without their consent. It's considered inhumane.</p>
<p>I imagine attitudes are similar in the UK, with similar results.</p>
<p>But somehow it would be okay now?</p>

        <p>Also, you could extend this argument ad absurdum all the way to  "the state should control your diet because otherwise you might get fat, and your fat ass is a public health hazard in case you have a heart attack at the wheel and crash into a schoolbus (think of the children!).  Opposition to this is mental illness :)</p>

        <p>I think what they're saying is it provides precedent for such a law, rather than that it would be under that same law. As someone mentally ill in the UK...it's not that I don't know how much contempt we're held in, but it's something that has never yet ceased to shock me. Considering using such a precedent to control the population, including us, and use potentially traumatic force to administer, not an actual treatment for a condition we have, but a vaccine, just shows no respect for the intent of the original law, nor how much fear we already have towards it. It equates the idea of the risk some -it's not all- of us could harm others or ourselves to the risk posed by an infectious disease.</p>
<p>This is, I hope, the usual legalese, cover-all-angles. But, the covid measures have already generated so much hate towards us, while an economic downturn will be very bad for us, I am scared in this atmosphere, so I ask that non-mentally ill people look out for us.</p>
<p>Do you think politicians hear themselves? It's one of the questions I ask myself a lot. I'd like to imagine that, were I, god forbid it, to come to the point of saying such things as our politicians have been this year, I'd hear myself and realise I'd gone too far, but it seems to be something power does, that they don't or at least not in the same way. Most people don't have very consistent principles without double-standards -it's Ok if we do it because we're the good guys but not if they do it, rather than understanding a thing is bad in itself-, so...</p>

        <p>I don't know if they have the same problems with the mentally ill homeless over there that we do in the states.  The problem is that they closed down the sanatoriums because they were a violation of people's "rights".  Instead the mentally ill are permitted to live on, defecate on, shoot up on - our streets.  This is very clearly detrimental to their health and the health of others.</p>
<p>Not taking the vaccine though, now that's a mental illness that needs housing and a "treatment".</p>

        <p>Well this is just academics discussing "evidence", but..</p>
<p>&rt; The requirement to vaccinate need not be exceptionless. For example, it should include exclusions for individuals in whom vaccination is likely to be unsafe or ineffective. In order to minimise restrictions on liberty, it <strong><em>might</em> also include an exclusion for individuals who are willing to lower their infection and transmission risk through other means, for example, through submitting to ‘lockdown’ and other mitigation measures</strong>.</p>
<p>There it is. Get the vaccine or stay in your house.</p>

        <p>Agree that 'considering' doesn't mean they'll do it -and it'd be under a new law based on the precedent if they did-, the act is still in force and is the one used to detain us mentally ill people, though.</p>

        <p>Considering forcefully injecting or locking unvaccinated people in their houses in case not enough people take the rushed vaccine?</p>
<p>&rt; Our submission pertains to compulsory Covid-19 vaccination: a requirement on individuals to undergo <strong><em>vaccination as a condition of release from pandemic-related restrictions on liberty, including on movement and association</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&rt; Should a Covid-19 vaccine become available at scale, <strong><em>we cannot expect sufficient voluntary uptake</em></strong>. It is necessary to consider a policy of compulsary vaccination, with appropriate exceptions. [7]</p>
<p>&rt; Given vaccine hesitancy, <strong><em>it may be necessary to compel vaccination in order to achieve herd immunity</em></strong>. The justifications for compulsory vaccination map onto the criteria for detention and treatment contained in the Mental Health Act 1983.</p>
