    <strong>What are the “skepticisms” around this pandemic?</strong>

        <p>For me: the fact that the phrase "new normal" was thrown out there, at least in the organization I work in, at the end of February 2020. It's almost like this was planned.</p>
<p>The timing of the whole thing.</p>
<p>The decades of medical science that has been thrown out the window (e.g., asymptomatic spread does not drive pandemics, masks do/don't work)</p>
<p>The clownish restrictions and hypocrisy. One week, there are healthcare workers supposedly blocking intersections against protesters who were protesting the initial lockdowns, WHILE DRIVING IN THEIR CARS !! But a few weeks later, tens of thousands are marching in the streets shoulder to shoulder, packed together, and the healthcare workers are standing outside of their hospitals, cheering on these protesters, with their fists in the air, similar to the fist raising motions and symbolism of communist societies of the past.</p>
<p>The time restrictions on businesses closing that make no sense. This 'novel' virus must only spread after 10pm, or 11pm, or whatever. (Which causes more people to gather at earlier times, instead of spreading out patronization over a longer period of time).</p>
<p>Large box stores were able to stay open, cramming hundreds of people inside the store, while small businesses, who have only a few people inside at a time, were forced to close. Forcing small businesses to go under, and providing the largest transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy ever seen in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>The increased mental health and physical health detriments to a large segment of the population. Tens of pounds were gained by a significant number of persons due to the lockdowns, which affects their immune systems and may put them worse off on fighting viruses and infections.</p>
<p>The fact that some governments had documents available on how they would handle a lockdown, none of which had lockdown of healthy people in those manuals, or plans.</p>
<p>A vaccine was produced in record time, BY THREE DIFFERENT COMPANIES, ALL ANNOUNCED WITHIN A THREE WEEK PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY HAD SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. The statistical odds of this happening are so astronomical that they would be considered zero chance of happening.</p>
<p>The brainwashing by the media on a large segment of the population, to make them think that it is okay for people to physically assault someone because they are not complying with mask mandates, social distancing, etc.</p>
<p>The authoritarian measures some governments are taking on their populations, while the authoritarians themselves are constantly seen breaking their own rules.</p>
<p>The cultish behavior and non-questioning of things by a large group of the population.</p>
<p>The media calling some large gatherings "super-spreader" events, while larger gatherings are ignored.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, and luckily for anyone reading this, I won't go on and on.</p>

        <p>The media and governments keep operating on the basis that this is a magical alien supervirus that has it's own rules and no one knows anything about (even after over a year). As if it wasn't a respiratory virus, a mild coronavirus...hardly anything enigmatic.</p>

        <p>Ok,  I live in Thailand. The protest happened, that’s true, but we still practice wearing masks. And do you know what happened after the protest? A Second wave of outbreak in Thailand.</p>

        <p>No offense, but I wouldn't trust any data regarding covid that comes out of Thailand, because Thailand is only at 17,422 covid tests per million.</p>
<p>One of the biggest determining factors in overall numbers is the rate of testing. </p>
<p>The USA is at 942,635 tests per million. the UK is at 1,078,621 tests per million. Almost every advanced, 1st world nation is over 500,000 tests per million. As you will notice, Thailand is barely testing.</p>

        <p>We have areas that is determined as safe and risky. People that moves in or out of a risky area needs to be  tested. While people in safe areas are encouraged to not move much. Plus A large part of Thailand’s population is people who haven’t got effected at all by the pandemic like the farmers who live amongst their acres of farm.</p>

        <p>The fact that the term 'New Normal' was being spouted globally within the 1st week is a major giveaway this was planned.</p>
