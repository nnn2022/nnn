<p>You know what? No. Isn't this what SJWs call sea lioning or walrusing or whatever? Use your fingers and search for "arguments against masks."</p>
<p>No one will explain it to you in a "way that resonates." I virtually guarantee you will find a way to disagree with any intellectual,  philosophical, or emotional argument,  and what few anti-mask studies that have escaped censorship will just be called "fake" or "bad science."</p>

        <p>Ok. Assuming you're serious,  I apologize and owe you a better answer. </p>
<p>People who believe masks are tyrannical believe one, some,  or all of the following arguments:</p>
<p>1) governments in a democracy should not be able to tell healthy humans how to behave when they are not deliberately attempting to harm others, especially as regards what they may wear or do with their bodies,  such as requiring women to cover their heads,  faces,  or bodies under sharia law. </p>
<p>2)  the science supporting their efficacy is extremely weak, and peer- reviewed studies showing that they are ineffective and even harmful are deliberately suppressed and censored, with publishers facing cancellation. </p>
<p>3) They're not trivial. In most western cultures,  they are an unnatural intrusion into public life.  They make breathing more difficult (fact), cause anxiety in many,  make social discourse like talking and understanding facial expressions difficult or impossible,  and serve to spread distrust and fear (search for 'human facial empathy' and read a few studies). They are historically symbols of suppression and humiliation outside of medical contexts in many cultures.</p>
<p>4) again, epidemiologically, they don't work.  Most people hospitalized for covid claim to have been fully compliant with masking and still got sick. Every jurisdiction with mask mandates STILL gets case increases at similar rates to those that don't, causing leaders to get angry,  say,  "you're all doing it wrong/ not compliant enough" and lock down harder,  rather than even consider the definition of insanity. </p>
<p>5) They are disproportionately used to shame, attack,  and punish restriction skeptics even when "experts" who promote their use agree their benefit is very small or marginal. </p>
<p>This is a start. Does this help in addressing your question, at least to understand where people are coming from?</p>

        <p>I'll throw in my two cents in response to this. The reason why those people got sick after being fully quarantine and mask compliant is the way masks work. Masks dont filter the air you breathe in. They filter the air you breathe out. And by filter, I mean they catch large moisture droplets present on you breath(the moisture is there, you'll see it if you breath on a cold day), which gives the virus nothing to travel on. That's why there's the 6 feet of separation. Without the droplets to travel on, it obviously wont go as far. If you want evidence on the water droplet stuff, look up Schlirien(I think that's how its spelled) imaging, a guy independently set up something to do it.</p>

        <p>Are you obligated to wear it even if you don’t want to? Does it cause discomfort? Make it harder to talk clearly? Get in your way of breathing fresh air? That’s what’s tyrannical. No different than a burqa, which is also imposed on women under the guise of ‘better for society’.</p>

        <p>I personally believe it's the tyrannical aspect of what some people (including myself) perceive to be government overreach, combined with the lack of clear evidence that it's doing anything more than acting as a pacifier to placate those that are scared of this disease.</p>
<p>The science is mixed on whether or not masks provide any net benefit.  In the lab, under perfectly controlled conditions, they appear to have a positive impact.  Out in the wild, where people are constantly touching their face to adjust their mask, etc., the results are less clear.</p>
<p>So you have the government essentially forcing us to do something for which there's no clear evidence that it actually helps, apparently just to placate the masses and try and show that they're "doing something".  That seems pretty tyrannical if you ask me.</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that this disease is not nearly as bad as the media has made it out to be and the way the whole thing has been handled just sits wrong with a lot of folks, myself included.</p>

        <p>Give me some negative karma all you want anti-maskers, but as a COVID patient myeslf, I’ve learned and regretted the fact that I didn’t wear masks in public areas. I always went to public parties, restaurants, all sorts of other public places, without masks, and I didn’t give a damn if I didn’t wear a mask or not. But soon enough, I was exposed to COVID. Don’t exactly know where, but let me tell you, I wish I had worn masks right when lockdown started, I wish I had followed the given protocols given in the first place. But I didn’t. And here I am, stuck in the house.</p>

        <p>What were you saying? I couldn't understand because of the piece of cloth over your mouth. </p>
<p>Something about murder charges, Muffles? No, that requires direct cause and intent. Merely having a physical condition that MAY pose a risk to a vanishingly small number of people doesn't count. I don't have covid anyway.  Yes, I'm sure. </p>
<p>Have you ever had a virus, EVER? Been in public for even a moment? You cannot disprove you've killed thousands indirectly yourself.  Shall I call the paddy wagon?</p>
<p>Sorry,  I STILL can't understand what you're saying,  but the squinting you're doing on what I can see of your face suggests you're angry. </p>
<p>Did you really just say that thing about murder charges to bully me for having a different opinion? That's cool. Some day,  your side and my side will have it out.  I suspect I'll be fine.  I've had more fresh air and practice with my 2nd Amendment than I suspect you have.</p>

        <p>Damn bro what a pussy you are. You can’t wear a piece of cloth over your mouth to save that vanishingly small number of people dying from COVID. And it’s been proven that masks don’t inhibit your breathing at all. And what the fuck does your second amendment have to do with it. Yeah you can own a gun. What fuckin funny is that if a terrorist attack comes you think you can singlehandley save everyone because you have a thing that goes pew pew. And if I had a virus and was out in public, I was wearing a mask so other people wouldn’t get it. That’s. The. Fucking. Point. Dipshit.</p>

        <p>Honest question, what is so bad about wearing a mask to yall. Why is it so difficult to put on a piece of cloth?</p>
<p>Even if you do not believe they work, its a small thing to do to make your fellow humans feel safer. Why is being self centered something people love to do. We are the same species, we should care about how eachother feel</p>

<p>You have bacteria living inside you, dumbass. Without them you would die. They are on every inch of the world. You cannot ‘shield’ yourself from bacteria.</p>
<p>As for viruses, you have something called an immune system. It learns to protect you from experience. Virus like those that cause the flu (with include corona viruses) strengthen your immune system, which, if never engaged, if useless. Unless you’re old, or very sick already, the common bacteria and viruses present in every day life, from the food you eat to the very lining of your gut, will not only hurt you, but make you healthier.</p>

        <p>Different kind of bacteria. Again- go to college. You'll learn all about that. I think what you're talking about is antibodies, what your body gains after defeating a disease. Hence my comparison with more deadly diseases than Corona. And those are nothing like the good bacteria living inside you right now. Once you defeat a disease, all that stays inside you is basically the knowledge on how to defeat it. Not the disease itself.</p>

        <p>Wait what? You’re so illiterate and write so badly that I’m no longer sure if you agree with me, and think it’s madness to try and keep all bacteria away, or you disagree. </p>
<p>That insistence with college might apply to you, rather. You might learn how to put your thoughts on paper. As they are, it’s like reading a rant, spittle and all. Very sad.</p>

<p>I never said that you should shield yourself from all bacteria. If that were the case, I wouldn't get vaccinated, because a lot of the time it contains the virus itself, just weakened.</p>
<p>What we should stay away from is dangerous, incurable diseases - Coronavirus. Which is why we wear masks, and why we stay 6 feet apart.</p>

        <p>It's awful. For most of my 50+ years, I haven't been able to put my face under water, as anything touching my nose makes me feel like I can't breathe. (By the way, people in my life used to ask me "what was so bad about water on my face" when we were at the pool.) I don't wear winter scarves over my nose. I don't put sheets or blankets over my face in bed.</p>
<p>So now, I wonder what's so bad about keeping your distance from uncovered folks in public? If you cared about them, you'd avoid them. If you were worried about your health, you'd avoid them. You can't tell if the person in the aisle with you at the grocery store is infected, but you can clearly see if they're uncovered.</p>

        <p>Except that quote was not used how you think it was used. Ben franklin was not disputing of the fact that people who give up liberty for safety Dont deserve liberty or safety. We was rather pitching in bis view on a dispute about taxes and war. It had nothing to do with a single person wanting to buy their own safety in exchange for liberty and does not have any place in an argument about masks as it actually proves the point opposite of yours. You were actually arguing the side of pro maskers when using that quote and i suggest you read up on things you are wanting to quote before actually quoting them</p>

        <p>Except it is different when im being kind and thoughtful to the people of the same species as mine and you are going against what some people need to be done to stay out of danger. If i had to wear a fucking vest that was glowing with pink and purple in order to make people feel safe i would, because thats the difference between me and you. I dont only think about myself. I want everyone around me to feel safe and peotected</p>

<p>So, of course you've stopped driving automobiles, right?  Because some people (blind folks, etc) will be safer if they don't have to worry about being hit by cars.</p>

<p>A cloth mask over your face isn’t protecting anyone. This is about how it makes you feel virtuous. </p>

        <p>Your health is your own responsibility. Wear whatever you need to feel safe, whether that be a full hazmat suit, a butt-plug, or both. Then you can be safe from the virus and leave everyone else alone, or stay home forever if that stuff doesn't make you feel safe enough.</p>
