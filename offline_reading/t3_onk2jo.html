        <p>I think they’re trying to slowly work toward a UBI. They’re already doing payouts for kids. My guess is they want to jack up taxes to the same rates as other counties or higher in an effort to reduce the gap in wealth. Make no mistake the rich will somehow be exempt still and middle class America will foot the bill to pay for everyone’s schooling, healthcare, rent, etc until eventually they run out of middle class people to drain.</p>

        <p>This has been a long time coming, however the TIMING was certainly related.</p>
<p>If you want the beans, in August 2019 - BlackRock authored a plan for "the next downturn" which involved the Fed transferring trillions to corporations under emergency measures. 3 weeks later in September, the Fed began intervention in markets and began execution of the plan.</p>
<p>Two days after that, Executive Order 13887 was signed and I'll let you look that up.</p>
<p>Then we had Event 201 in October, and the rest was the playout of the emergency needed to justify the transfer of trillions.</p>
<p>However, the plan started before that. In 2017, the World Bank issued first ever "Pandemic Bonds." They partnered with WHO 6 months later. Now fast forward to 2020 - just a couple months before the money would be returned to investors... The WHO needed more deaths in order to declare a pandemic, which is in the fine print of the \~380 page prospectus --- that if a pandemic is declared, the bonds do not return to the investors.</p>
<p>Next thing you know 5 governors (and various other world leaders) sent recovering Covid-19 patients (of all ages) into nursing homes to be in the same breathing space as the people most susceptible to this virus. Several governors ordered that the nursing homes were not allowed to test incoming patients for Covid-19! I kid you not -- this is real (!)</p>
<p>The result was a rapid infection and death in nursing homes which triggered the fine print in the prospectus.</p>
<p>Worse -- this wasn't directly about the money. It was only between 500 and 1000 million ... The real point was money laundering, because this money was then distributing around the globe.</p>
<p>It appears that this is how this global operation was funded.</p>
<p>And who bought the pandemic bonds? Who would buy these bonds, right? I mean -- we knew about Ebola and SARS and MERS by then so what smart investor would buy bonds that might not pay out???</p>
<p>Answer: people's pensions and retirement funds were invested into these bonds (!) so they had no say in it, and also I suspect the rest were purchased by corporations and individuals that would profit during the lockdowns and pandemic.</p>
<p>If we could get that list, to see what individuals and corporations bought those bonds --- it would be quite a smoking gun if it turns out to be people and organizations that profited from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you are right that economics are at the root of all this. It is true with every war, and this is most certainly a war.</p>
