    <strong>What is the end game?</strong>
    <p><p>New here. I find most of the evidence here not very persuasive. For example, Why bother to put something in the COVID vaccine when they could have done it to any of the other numerous vaccines people take. Anyway, still willing to entertain alternative theories about the state of the world. The thing I keep coming back to is what is the end game? Assuming the push for a “new normal” is insidious or planned, what’s the point? It seems to me that the world was pretty securely controlled by the people you say who are lying to me. What changed? Why do they need to disrupt the status quo?</p>
<p>Edit #1: No, I'm not just here to troll. I'm just intensely skeptical of a lot of what has been written in the subreddit. I want to believe, but as I said, I'm not yet convinced.</p>
<p>Edit#2: Addressing a common thing I'm seeing. One version of this story is that the UN and WEF and rich people are up to no good. Let's assume you are right. Now let's take a world that looks the exact same but there's no conspiracy and the official story is true. How do you tell the difference? That's the key piece of evidence that is lacking in a lot of what I've read.</p></p>

        <p>I guess where I have trouble believing that is you are just describing the state of the world before COVID, at least in the United States. Arguably all of that has already happened, well before COVID. Maybe it wasn’t/hasn’t?</p>

        <p>Yes that is true except Covid has been used to accelerate the process about a decade. The rate of implementation was too slow and a catalyst was required to garner consent to leap ahead.  These objectives have been a long time in the making.</p>

        <p>I'm much more apt to believe that someone seeking power used a naturally occuring event to push an agenda than I am to believe that either covid or the vaccine is somehow man made to kill and sterilize, like some people here. For example, they already had the flu vaccine; they didn't need to make a new one. The rich people were already nearly in complete control of the world, that's how they got rich. Of course they don't care about me or my survival...that's how they got rich. If they want to turn of the machine they made that's destroying the world (which, from what I gather is the narrative here), they didn't need covid to do it. They can just stop selling food to people and destroy the logistics lines that keep the world going.</p>

        <p>How do you figure that they could've just used one of the vaxs out here...there are too many antivaxxers and skeptics.. so the ONLY way to ensure everyone gets this shot is to cause a MASS hysteria by starting a global pandemic..scare everyone into fearing it so when the vax comes out they are begging for it..
It worked,,, by the way, the needs somthing much larger to cause much more damage then a natural disaster or such..</p>

        <p>But anti-Vaxxers who don’t trust vaccines with years of relatively safe track records aren’t going to suddenly go get a vaccine that was rushed to market. This subreddit is proof of that. Only half of the country is vaccinated, where 90% of kids have the MMR vaccine. Further, as people like to point out, the mortality rate is next to nothing. Face it, if their plan was what you say it was they have failed. Odds are they aren’t so incompetent to pick this crappy of a plan AND careful enough to keep some secret nefarious plan. It doesn’t make any sense. Every time you add an assumption to a theory, the less likely it is to be true. Occam’s Razor, man.</p>

        <p>I mean, so far that has been demonstrably false. Let’s ignore the fact that I’m vaccinated(separate issue, below). I can go pretty much where ever I want, no one makes me show any papers, I already had a kid post COVID, and what’s the difference between UBI and a paycheck from a Fortune 500 company. Either way someone is living off my labor?</p>
<p>The vaccine may be fatal, but so is COVID. So is living. That isn’t a conspiracy that’s life. I could see rich people wanting to hasten my death, but why not do that with the flu shot, something that has already been accepted by the population. Sorry, I really am trying to understand. I just don’t see what you see, maybe that’s the problem?</p>

        <p>Demonstrably false? We can go through my comment point by point. I haven’t been proven wrong yet.</p>
<p>It’s orchestrated by the WEF and the UN (Agenda 2030). It’s not about health. It’s about control and wealth redistribution. Look into Event 201 if you want your mind blown.</p>
<p>They put all the information out there for you to see. They’re not trying to hide anything.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, my pregnant coworker called me and said she’s suffering blood clots and almost miscarried. She was recently vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I can demonstrate that the first point in your argument has already happened and was rescinded in the United States. I'm willing to entertain the idea that the time table is different in the more developed world than the less developed world. Okay. That still doesn't explain why they Made/needed Covid. Let's assume, they just used it to accelerate their plan. I'm not seeing how the world you are suggesting is coming is any different than what is already in place now. That means they already won. They don't need a new normal. I guess that's why I am having trouble believing this thread.</p>

        <p>They fanatically believe in the Malthusian model, and as per the book Limits to Growth, what is needed is population control, pollution control and resource allocation control. </p>
<p>They think, that humans are inherently and inevitable destructive, and that we will keep multiplying until we expend all the resources that made the world sustain the billions that are alive today and billions more that will grow the population until a breaking point, at which the planet's population sustainment capacity crashes and population numbers will revert to below 1 billion, which of course will, in their mind, cause over 10 billion deaths. So they need to curtail human consumption, human population growth, centrally manage resource utilization, and fully regulate all industry for pollution, putting you into total slavery and sterilized. </p>
<p>All their models are incredibly low iq and wrong, of course, but that doesn't stop them. Their messianic delusions make them stop at nothing.</p>

        <p>Okay, that seems fair. But that's not a conspiracy. That's a difference of opinion. I can see the argument that the powerful need to curb a future that may not happen. What I'm concerned with is that the people in this sub seem to think the rich haven't already won. I'm just not convinced that that isn't the case. The developed world is a consumption machine, and most people are already living in a reality akin to slavery if you read into their existential crises.</p>

        <p>100% man. It's so ironic though hey. All the contributing factors of 'population growth and over consumption' are the result of their greed. It's all flawed, look at how much wastage there is and look at the amount of poverty there is. Stop the wastage by giving it to the poor = no more poverty = better societal outcomes.</p>

<p>To sum it up, we are at the end of this economic cycle. 2008 should have been the end, but they pushed the bubble further. Now it is about to pop, and when it does there will be an entire globe of angry people who suddenly lose what they have and are asked to accept austerity measures while the people we've spent our entire lives making rich don't give up anything, and actually get more.</p>
<p>Yes, the world is "controlled by those people now" but we are talking about massive hordes of angry people, all at once. With that kind of chaos, even someone rich and power can't guarantee their own safety. It's just too big at that scale.</p>
<p>So Covid-19 provided the emergency measures to justify BlackRock's plan for the next downturn --- a transfer of trillions to corporations and people, while an infrastructure is built that will subdue an angry population.</p>
<p>This includes a new standard of virus fear and virus lockdowns.</p>
<p>Everything I just said is 100% and absolute. There's no debate to be had about it -- it just is what it is. That's what's happening.</p>
<p>The next part is speculation:</p>
<p>Why the vaccines?  Remember what I said about hordes of angry people?  They can only do so much if they are incapacitated by the long term side effects of an mRNA gene therapy that permanently release harmful spike proteins into all their cells.  The clotting disorders which affect peoples lungs, giving them shortness of breath and tiredness. The clotting disorders in the brains which will lead to strokes and permanent brain fog. The heart problems that will cause death at the point someone gets so too excited (i.e. adrenaline rush at a massive protest.)</p>
<p>What else? The spike protein may modify cells universally for pathogenic priming -- meaning they will OVERreact to later variants and virus.</p>
<p>It may also prove to be a single line of input that could respond to another virus which is released in the midst of this economic crisis.</p>
<p>Every indicator points to total financial collapse and the system is preparing for it. When the trigger happens, or when the Fed starts it by raising interest rates -- everything else will happen too.</p>
<p>Maybe the trigger is when the long-term side effects become apparent...?  You might notice the rush to get EVERYONE vaccinated, even children who do not suffer from the virus.</p>
<p>They have to move fast because if they wait too long, the side effects will become apparent. Whistleblowers have already reported that the media is lying about all the new deaths being related to "the unvaccinated." On the contrary, they say it's the vaccinated and also covering up reactions to the vaccine.</p>
<p>But I can tell you're not here for real discussion so I don't care to continue it further. just assume I'm crazy and go take your vaccine. </p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

        <p>I have trouble believing the economic theater line of thinking because I have a pretty deep understanding of what happened in 2008, and a lot of this business about what did or didn’t happen then in the article just simply isn’t accurate. I’m also a proponent of MMT, so I don’t buy the fear about currency debasement. The reality is the dollar has been falling in value for decades as private companies mine out the value by capturing money paid out by the government in various forms. Too much money is only worthless when there’s nothing to buy with that money. That’s the real reason inflation is rising. An increase in the money supply and a decrease in productivity will 100% of the time lead to temporary inflation. If the fed is trying to stave off economic collapse they’re doing a crappy job at it considering post COVID policies are driving us closer to collapse rather than further away. Time will tell.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with this argument is that China is very clearly working in building a closed economy. They are, rightfully so, not at all worried about the collapse of the US economy. They will unpeg their currency from the dollar the moment that such a collapse is likely. They don’t need to export things to the US’s 320m population when they have over a billion potential internal consumers. They literally have nothing to fear economically. They’re only interested in leapfrogging the US by stealing intellectual property like the USA did to the British in the 18th and 19th centuries. They have authoritarian control over their populace as the events in Hong Kong show. They have no reason to go along with the US’s charade.</p>
<p>Anyone who has read legacy of ashes or has followed the known history of the CIA should know that any appeal to a deep state is laughable at best. The intelligence community has had so many failures that have hurt the agencies that their ability to pull off a mass conspiracy is highly unlikely. Someone would have already fucked it up. </p>
<p>The world is a zero sum game, someone will benefit from both sides of this story. I don’t see any reason why the people who are in charge now would intentionally set off the economic bomb unless they’re stupid. Honestly what’s way more terrifying to me is that no one is running this machine that is the world’s geopolitical sphere. I’ve seen how the sausage gets made at the international level. I can tell you the UN can barely organize their own committees, let alone a global conspiracy. </p>
<p>I guess we’ll see in a few years who is right.</p>

        <p>I think it's general incompetence. As someone that works for the government I see how it's all about getting to where you can retire or for the higher positions retaining your income and status. I don't think they're willfully evil, but they're uncaring of who gets stomped on while they go through their careers. The people in the highest positions really don't seem like they have a clue and it's honestly kinda disheartening to see first hand lol</p>

        <p>I think that's particularly fair, but isn't the incompetence also likely to be so great that some kind of world-wide fraud is highly unlikely? Not saying that a lot of the stuff here isn't true, it just seems that it isn't anymore likely than people just being stupid rather than a grand plan.</p>
