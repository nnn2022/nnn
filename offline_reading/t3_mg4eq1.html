    <strong>Post from "Skeptics" Facebook page trashing John Ioannidis for going against the narrative getting lots of healthy pushback in the comments</strong>
    <p><p>The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theskepticsguide/posts/10159015568496605">Facebook post</a> attacking one of the leading authorities on viruses getting lots of healthy pushback in the comments:</p>
<p>&rt; John Ioannidis is one of the most published and influential scientists in the world, someone whose skewering of bad medical research we at SBM have frequently lauded over the years. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Since then, Prof. Ioannidis has been publishing dubious studies that minimize the dangers of the coronavirus, shown up in the media to decry “lockdowns,” and, most recently, “punched down”, attacking a graduate student for having criticized him. What happened? Did Prof. Ioannidis change, or was he always like this and I just didn’t see it? Either way, he’s a cautionary tale of how even science watchdogs can fall prey to hubris.

<p>His published estimate for the global IFR of COVID-19 is <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13423">0.15-0.20% overall and 0.03-0.04% for those &lt;70 years old</a>.</p></p>

        <p>The corona cowards are facing the biggest crisis of their lives. They have sunk more than a year into their stupidity. They cannot let it go and thus anyone who challenges their insane interpretations of numbers must be crucified.</p>
<p>Excess mortality is the biggest red herring in the stupid pie. Over what period of time do we take excess mortality to be valid? This isn't even defined. Nor could it be. Because if we run a century's worth of data - then the coronavirus isn't an exceptional event and thus, "excess mortality" when measured against the ordinary ebb and flow of human mortality vs. natural events is zero. </p>
<p>Comparing to last year or the year or even the last 5 years is meaningless. There's not enough data to show the huge variance in human mortality in those narrow bands. But on the dribbling spazztards go because they can't stop, to do so would mean admitting they were wrong. </p>
<p>So, they must try and trash the highly respected and highly able scientists on the other side of the line who never agreed with their madness in the first place.</p>

        <p>"punched down" sounds like some weird ass woke term. Says a lot about who wrote that little missive.</p>

        <p>People will do anything to protect their ego. This is the hill they’ll die on. </p>
<p>It’s easier for a liberal to believe this man has either lost intellect... or been paid off by conspiracy theorists, than to just give him his due credit.</p>
<p>The weak mindedness of humanity is truly exposed here.</p>
