<title>From Johns Hopkins - "the total decrease in deaths by other causes almost exactly equals the increase in deaths by COVID-19. This suggests...deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be recategorized as being due to COVID-19."</title>

        <p>This! I have friends of my parents who work for JHH in Baltimore and they were exposing this 4 months ago, that the CoVid-19 deaths might be from other diseases.</p>
<p>The only time they are not is in the case of people like my deceased mother, where she had no pre-existing conditions that were serious at all or untreated.</p>
<p>Multi-organ failure is simply due to CoVid-19 when it happens while CoVid-19 is in your system without any other pre-ex's.</p>

        <p>&rt; Editor’s Note: After The News-Letter published this article on Nov. 22, it was brought to our attention that our coverage of Genevieve Briand’s presentation “COVID-19 Deaths: A Look at U.S. Data” has been used to support dangerous inaccuracies that minimize the impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Nothing to see here, just a retracted article.</p>

        <p>There's something huge to see here. The article wasn't retracted because they found it to be inaccurate. It was retracted because people, when given the actual data, choose not to be afraid and we can't have that now can we? No! You will be exactly as afraid as they tell you to be! If the facts comfort you, then we will retract the facts.  </p>
<p>The retraction is as big a story as the information the article contains. The retraction + the content of the data analyzed in the virus paint a pretty stark picture. Namely that the Media is the Virus.   We live in an age of "Truth over Facts". Doesn't matter what the facts are. The truth is what the media decides it to be.</p>

        <p>No, it was retracted because people (like you) are coming to the wrong conclusion based on limited data.</p>
<p>&rt; <em>Briand was quoted in the article as saying, “All of this points to no evidence that COVID-19 created any excess deaths. Total death numbers are not above normal death numbers.” This claim is incorrect and does not take into account the spike in raw death count</em> <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-raw-death-count?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;region=World"><em>from all causes</em></a> <em>compared to previous years. According to the CDC, there have been almost</em> <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_deathsper100k"><em>300,000 excess deaths</em></a> <em>due to COVID-19. Additionally, Briand presented data of total U.S. deaths in comparison to COVID-19-related deaths as a proportion percentage, which trivializes the repercussions of the pandemic. This evidence does not disprove the severity of COVID-19; an increase in excess deaths is not represented in these proportionalities because they are offered as percentages, not raw numbers.</em></p>

<p>Oh I don't doubt that there are excess deaths in 2020, just not due to Covid. Check out Sweden who did not lockdown and seriously interrupt people's lives. They are on track for exactly the same number of deaths as previous years.</p>
<p>The lockdowns, depression, drug &amp; alcohol abuse, dietary changes, sedentary living, missed medical appointments, etc have definitely lead to excess deaths in the countries where they were implemented.</p>
<p>But Covid? Nah Covid mostly kills the dying.
https://www.cidjournal.com/article/S0738-081X(20)30231-5/fulltext</p>
<p>Conclusion: The risk of a patient dying of covid was significantly influenced by a patient's DNR status.</p>
<p>And who tends to have a DNR in place? That's right, the terminally ill!</p>

<p>I still think that the covid deaths are overblown, but just know that if you're sharing this article with doomers they will most likely fact check and find that the article was retracted and therefore discount anything you have to say about numbers being inflated or recategorized. Just so you're informed. </p>
<p>I will say that the graphs I sent my bro about Sweden's deaths being low overall this year has not been refuted. He actually has not commented on that piece I sent him even though I've brought it up a few times, he's just conventionally ignoring the fact that the place with some of the least restrictions throughout the pandemic has not seen an increase in overall deaths this year, in fact it's their second least deadly year on record, so far.</p>
