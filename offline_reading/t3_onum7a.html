        <p>I think it's fairly safe to say that I care about what you think about as much as you care what I think.</p>
<p>I do not trust the current scientific community because I believe much of it has been subverted by corporations and politicians who seek personal wealth and power over truth.</p>
<p>But you do you.   I hope you're not damaged by the injections you take.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t… not in children and young adults and most people under 60. For those at risk I get vaccination. And if someone young and scared wants it they should. But it’s way too early to claim anything in regards to vaccine safety and effectiveness. Not even FDA approved</p>

        <p>I doubt the shots have any impact on viral immunity.  Nor does it matter one way or the other.</p>
<p>The shots are only there as a macguffin - to get a majority of people on board with a digital identity.   </p>
<p>The digital identity that is then required to shop, pay bills, work, travel etcetera.  </p>
<p>Then the new digital currency will be introduced, tied to this identification system.</p>

        <p>I disagree a bit.  I had to delete my original reply because I realized I had misinterpreted part of your comment.</p>
<p>The people that read and write articles like this are very into marketeering, but NOT science, nor health either just like you said.</p>
<p>Science has a LOT of scientific knowledge and evidence about health.  Science <em>greatly</em> concerns itself with health.</p>
<p>People that are into health ought to also be into actual science, because we require actual science to inform our pursuit of health.</p>
<p>Science and health are two separate things, but more importantly: marketing and science are two separate things.  The healthcare sector dupes practically everybody into believing their marketing is science.  It's not; it's simply marketing.</p>
<p>The <em>entirety</em> of science that concerns itself with health has been completely ignored in favor of the marketeering agenda(s) at play.</p>

        <p>When your Governor orders vaccine boosters for this year, 2022, 2023, and 2024 are you going to take them all? </p>
<p>Maybe your Governor doesn't order the vaccines, maybe it's Joe Biden but are you still going to take them?</p>
<p>As for the scientific process, its broken. I love science but I no longer trust it because simple facts of the universe are now no longer black and white. We are told that 2 + 2 = 5. Literally we were told two plus two can equal five and that math is racist. Science right now is hurting, think of all the scientists that wanted to support the lab leak hypothesis but chose not to because they did not want the left to think they were aligned with Donald Trump. Only when the story got out and Trump was out of office did these scientists say <em>"hey yeah, I lied this is what I actually believe"</em> </p>
<p>So, will you take a booster every year for the next 4 years?</p>

        <p>I'm a physician.  I do not doubt that the vaccine triggers an immune response.  Nor do I doubt that a second vaccine triggers an even stronger response.  It was designed to do that, it was tested with that as its primary goal, and appears to be delivering on what it was intended to do.  Was that not what you were expecting to hear?</p>

        <p>Well, here's the issue.  Just as the Covid spike protein may help protect against variations of other spikes on other coronaviruses, the average person gets exposed to lots of coronaviruses and that is why they are already immune to Covid-19.  It works both ways.  </p>
<p>It's quite possible that the vaccine is a wonderful treatment for various coronaviruses.  However, the technology has not been adequately tested for the long term.  And we don't fully know what kind of damage it causes to give us those benefits.  That's why a lot of people aren't getting the vaccine.  The risk/benefit just isn't there, in their estimation.</p>

        <p>What do you think of the PCR tests cycled at 35 and over producing false positives? Why no list of ingredients for the vaccines? No liability for vaccine manufacturers? No long-term trials concluding till the end of 2022? 
This is a racket and it seems like many folks are dogmatic believers in scientism where they trust the oligarch funded and curated agenda driven science as the truth. Might want to start learning the history of the ruling class and the "Great Reset" because they don't need that many of us for the 4th industrial revolution.</p>

        <p>I think it’s normal and not an issue. Increasing PCR cycles doesn’t decrease its specificity, it does increase its sensitivity however since a PCR cycle is just an amplification of DNA. So if someone has trace amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in their sample, higher cycles means you can detect lower amounts of SARS-CoV-2. While yes, this means someone with low amounts of the virus who may not get infected can show up as positive, the biggest benefit is catching people who are infected in the early stages since there isn’t much virus there yet - hopefully before they become contagious.</p>
<p>The components of the vaccines have been public knowledge for awhile: https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Coronavirus/Community_Resources/Vaccinations/Print-Materials/Fact-Sheets/Ingredients_English.pdf</p>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers have been exempt, in the US at least, from liability for a long time because the bar to successfully sue a vaccine company for injury is extremely low in the legal system. A plaintiff doesn’t need to prove the vaccine caused their injury, just that it’s in the realm of possibility it could have. Thus making vaccines would be way too risky for any company to produce. Without protecting the vaccine companies from mostly frivolous lawsuits we’d have no vaccines which would be disastrous. The US has a federal fund for those with supposed vaccine injuries to submit a claim and get compensated at least. </p>
<p>The clinical trials are running to 2022 to pretty much just look at long term efficacy/durability of the immunity the vaccines convey. It’s a way to see if boosters should be recommended or not.</p>

<p>I’m talking about what’s going on from my perspective. In the US. People die from diabetes and cancer here because they can’t afford health care or even screenings.</p>
<p>All that money got dumped into Operation Warp Speed to develop and distribute these “vaccines” to people who didn’t need them, and some of whom (not a small number btw) ended up dead or worse off for it than they probably would have if they got covid.</p>
<p>If the government wanted to allocate funds to pay off covid patients’ medical debt, I would be all for that. I would be completely fine with my tax dollars going to help those people. I support accessible healthcare for all.</p>
<p>But instead it’s being wasted on stupid marketing campaigns and sending people door to door to harass people about getting the vaccine, and if you don’t see the problem with that I don’t know what to tell you</p>

        <p>The only meaningful solution is revamping your country’s medical system to match pretty much every other developed countries’ layout whereby tax dollars fund a far more cost effective and affordable public healthcare system that’s free at the point of care. </p>
<p>A for profit healthcare system is only going to result in insane medical debt/costs because patients are seen as customers, not fellow human beings who have lives. </p>
<p>Well the governments’ programs to try and raise vaccination rates is a good use of funds since if you get vaccinated you’ll reduce your chances greatly of having medical debt due to covid.</p>

        <p>I agree with some of this. We do need to revamp the healthcare system. No one should go into debt for the rest of their life because they get sick or injured.</p>
<p>Do you not realize these vaccines leave many people in a worse condition than they were before? You refuse to acknowledge my point about that. Who’s going to cover their medical bills? The vaccine companies are like 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>And that money could be spent on researching actual TREATMENT for covid and other conditions, or paying off medical debt. Rather than stupid advertisement.</p>

        <p>Exactly, capitalism is great in some areas but not for fields where compassion must take precident such as healthcare. </p>
<p>I’m ignoring it because it’s patently false the vaccines are harming large portions of the population. But fyi the US has a national vaccine injury compensation fund as a middleground for protecting vaccine companies from liability while still payong out those who may have been injured by vaccines. And the reason they’re protected is because the bar for a plaintiff to sue successfully for a vaccine injury is so low - thus making vaccines not financially worth the risk to make. Without this protection no one would make any vaccines which would be very bad.</p>
<p>How about we focus on vaccines to prevent covid in the first place and be proactive instead of treating people? We have effective vaccines and we have also greatly advanced the treatment of covid-19 with dexamethasone and regeneron’s antibody therapy. The government paying off medical debt in the US ain’t gonna happen ever until the whole healthcare system becomes publically operated with private insurance companies removed from the picture unfortunately.</p>

        <p>Hey there, I'm not the person you responded to, but I'd like your opinion when you have the time.  You wrote "the more people get vaccinated the more shit gets back to normal, is it that hard to grasp" and I'd like to hear more, but right now I <em>do</em> find it hard to grasp, and I made a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/on6k17/other_than_it_being_contagious_what_have_the/">post</a> about it yesterday.  In essence, why should I trust that after repeated failures, the so-called 'experts' have it right this time?</p>
<p>Honest question.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the honest question rather than being snarky and sarcastic. I have to ask, what are you specifically talking about with the experts being constantly wrong? If it’s only about the items in your post I’ll comment on those.</p>
<p>So first off, models for covid cases, deaths, etc. are set using several different parameters that at best are estimations so they aren’t crystal ball predictions into the future. However, they are useful and the reason you don’t see reality reflecting them is because we respond to these models and thus make changes to our public health measures early to make sure the worst case scenario of these models doesn’t actually happen. In my province Ontario when it came to our third wave, our Premier elected to not put restrictions back in place earlier because he wanted to confirm things were actually going to get bad. So during his waiting the trend in cases and hospitalizations did match the predicted model if we did nothing different and that’s when he chose to close stuff down - kinda stupid cause the whole point of these models/projections is to avoid them becoming reality. But it does show that they are mostly accurate if we keep on the same path.</p>
<p>As for surface transmission, that was us just not having enough data and thinking it was better to be safe than sorry. Tbh I was very early on against being so paranoid about surface transmission considering lab studies used insane concentrations of the virus to show it lasted long on surfaces - but they didn’t show how contagious it was here. The media didn’t help here either and personally as a scientist myself I’m quite disappointed this issue wasn’t tackled earlier on (though at least the NYC subway finally got cleaned lol). And as for “quite awhile”, science is unfortunately slow and covid shutdowns had made research far harder to do (my own work got stopped for months in 2020 and then moved at crawl as our research facility slowly increased its capacity).</p>
<p>Asymptomatic spread wasn’t listed as a major driver in the sense that there weren’t that many people who had covid-19, were contagious, and would never be symptomstic. Instead what was being stated was that covid-19 is primarily driven by pre-symptomatic spread. Unlike many other respiratory disease someone who catches covid-19 and WILL show symptoms will be contagious several days before these symptoms develop - this is a plain fact and is why this virus started a pandemic in the first place.</p>
<p>The mask one frankly pisses me off because it was terrible communication by the CDC, though I also know why they did it. Initially there wasn’t much research to strongly support or strongly not support wearing masks but it was better to be safe than sorry especially with something as harmless as a mask. Issue was was that supply chains were low and as we saw with the toilet paper fiasco peope will hoard stuff. To ensure healthcare workers had the maximum amount of PPE supplies the CDC did initially state masks for the community were not needed. However, as studied were coming out, real world data from Asia, and supply improved then the risk-reward balance skewed towards masking the general population too which is when the CDC changed its recommendation. As for the double masking, that was based off studied that suggested improved prevention of viral spread but at the same time one masks was quite good still so it was kinds unnecessary- though not incorrect advice.</p>
<p>The other big issues with how lockdowns were handled, that pretty much all came from politicians taking charge and not listening or even getting advice from scientific advisors. It’s happened here in Ontario and it’s happened in a lot of other places. Cuomo is a callous man that got people killed and tbh should be charged with negligence or something. I argue in the US the lack of a unifying federal guide to managing covid-19 made it so each state had to just experiment with different lockdown measures, resulting the in the messed you described which were not based on scientific recommendations.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the public health recommendations given are based on the science at the time which can and will change as our researchers conduct more experiments over time. While the conclusions drawn may not be the most correct ones all the time, they are based on the best available evidence at the time. Unfortunately covid-19 made everyone want science to proceed at a breakneck pace which just isn’t possible, but decisions still had to be made before the research caught up with the demand. I hope I addressed your question, please feel free to reach out for more. Fyi I’m a molecular geneticist not an immunologist or epidemiologist, however my work does touch upon those fields substantially.</p>

<p>The people who lost their businesses and livelihoods would argue that the worst case scenario <em>did</em> actually happen.</p>
<p>&rt;something as harmless as a mask</p>
<p>Gotta disagree with that one, for many of us they are quite harmful, for a variety of reasons.  Maybe not to <em>you</em>, but to other people they are.  And I would also argue that they are harmful for <em>all</em> toddlers at the least, both having to wear one, and having to see other people wear them.</p>
<p>&rt;everyone want science to proceed at a breakneck pace</p>
<p>Not me, and not other people I know.  In fact it's the opposite; I think we should have proceeded much more cautiously in some ways, including the closing of the parks as one small example.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.  It covers a lot of ground, some of which we share it seems.</p>

        <p>I would argue losing a loved one, a close friend, or their own lives would be a worst case scenario. At the same time, that’s governmental policy fucking them over by not supporting their business during lockdowns vs. the advice of experts to enact lockdowns. Btw these lockdowns were supposed to be short term stopgaps, not long term solutions. They just got dragged out by too many not cooperating.</p>
<p>I can see for a select group where they can be disruptive such as they who rely on lip reading to assist if they are hard of hearing and they definitely are annoying for children but you’re gonna have to provide proof of severe physical and psychological issues from masks for “many” people.</p>
<p>Outdoor common spaces should never have been closed and tbh people recommending that either had no idea what they’re talking about or decided to be too cautious. And what I mean in terms of people wanting science to move faster are things like showing if airborne transmission really is happening, or how virulent the virus really is, etc. Here we were cautious in our measures and need time to confirm what the next best step is. Because if you relax too early the past measures may have all been for naught.</p>
<p>Cheers, it was nice to hear your concerns and at least get to civilly respond to them!</p>

        <p>I would argue that not being allowed to visit one's dying (from dementia) mother in the nursing home would be a worst case scenario, and that's what happened to me.  We were told she had lucid moments every day, but she had no clue about any virus.  They suggested we gather outside her window, forced us to wear masks (again, outside) and attempt a Zoom call with her.  Since that was our only option we did so, which only furthered the confusion in her mind I believe.  She died on July 10th, 2020, feeling abandoned by her own family.  I will never be okay with that.</p>
<p>I don't think I said that wearing a mask causes "severe physical and psychological issues" .......I said they are harmful to many of us.  Does it really have to go into the realm of severe in order to not want people, including children, to be forced to wear one?  I turn it back to you:  you cannot prove your statement of "something as harmless as a mask".  We don't know the long term consequences of children having their socializing skills being restricted by the mask wearing; it will take years to understand it, and we probably never will fully.  But it's not natural, or we would have already been doing it.</p>
<p>I appreciate your civility.  We see this through different lenses but can still be respectful about it.  That's a good thing.</p>

        <p>It may not mean much coming from an anonymous Redditor but I’m honestly sorry for your loss. Dementia is a terrible thing to experience a loved one go through and even worse if you are not able to be with them in person. I have serious reservations myself how nursing homes handled things with covid-19. From their perspective, any risk of a covid-19 outbreak was too great as the elderly makeup the vast majority of covid-19 deaths. At the same time, there must’ve been some considerate middle ground they should’ve achieved such as visits outdoors or in specific visitor rooms that were clean/ventilated after each use. Your frustration and anger is extremely justified and I won’t pretend to know what that’s like. </p>
<p>As for the masks, my apologies for misusing “severe”, I guess to me if masks should be avoided it’s because they must be causing severe harm since there is a global pandemic going on. So to tip the risk-reward ratio completely the other way it must be due to serious health concerns. Okay I was referring to physical health in terms of harmless but as for socialization I think you’d need to have evidence that masks do impair socialization among children first. Because if without masks kids spread the virus and bring it home I think losing their grandparents or even a parent (depending on their age/comorbidities) would have a more severe impact on their socialization/upbringing.</p>

        <p>It means a lot.  Thanks for understanding.  It's a horrible disease.  We hated putting her in a nursing home but she was just wasting away at home and almost immediately after we moved her she started doing much better, or so we were told.</p>
<p>I have to go so I'm not going to look it up right now, but it wasn't just Fauci saying masks don't work it was the WHO saying the same thing much later.  Lots of other studies suggest they don't work too, at least not in the real world.  I wouldn't mind getting into that more if you'd like, I just won't be able to respond for a while.</p>
<p>Again though, thanks for your condolences.  It really happened the way I say.</p>
<p>One last thought:  I hear all the time things like "spread the virus", which implies that that is all that matters.  Not <em>other</em> viruses mind you, just <em>this</em> one.  The one that more than 99.9% of us didn't die from.  It's fascinating to me.</p>

        <p>Because preventing disease is always better than treating with it - being proactive with your health is the best avenue to being healthy. Covid-19 has demonstrated long term complications even in younger seemingly healthy people.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we want to achieve herd immunity to protect those who can’t get vaccinated for legit medical reasons (and are thus also more at risk of covid-19 complications) we need as many people vaccinated as possible. </p>
<p>And finally, the more people the virus can infect the more chances for mutations to occur - vaccines kill the evolutionary opportunities for a pathogen.</p>
<p>Fyi, natural immunity is far more inconsistent in terms of antibody levels and durability than vaccine immunity as disease course has a strong impact on the degree of natural immunity acquired whereas the vaccine dosage is consistent between individuals.</p>

        <p>Are you arguing they aren’t science because they don’t fundamentally work or they aren’t science because you think we don’t need a vaccine then? </p>
<p>Cause I’m a molecular geneticist, I work in the lab with the same tech that makes the mRNA vaccines work. These vaccines are real science and if the science behind them didn’t work, well our fundamentals of biology would be completely wrong then. </p>
<p>As for if we need them, well there’s a virulent disease going around that has killed 4 million people so duh yeah we do. But I’m also not an expert in the field of immunology/epidemiology so I’ll let the experts from those fields make the call there.</p>

<p>That's literally "Idiocracy" (2006) level of science.  LITERALLY.</p>
<p>Good job buddy.</p>
<p>Follow the science, amirite guys!</p>
<p>Of course then on queue you go into your full-on appeal to authority logical fallacy.</p>
<p>What other logical fallacies you got queued up?  Got an ad hominem for me?  How about a strawman?</p>
<p>BTW, on your "4 million" figure:  your books are cooked.  </p>
<p>GTFO with your dangerous misinformation.</p>

        <p>What I was implying was that it’s been established knowledge for centuries to respond to virulent pathogens with vaccines to be proactive in prevent disease spread. That’s been established science for generations, so duh yeah.</p>
<p>Deferring to experts in fields you are not sufficiently knowledgeable in is not an appeal to authority falicy. If that were the case why bother having surgeons to defer to, why don’t you do the surgery yourself? Or why bother with mechanics to fix our cars when that’s just an appeal to authority? Or why bother deferring to airline pilots to fly the passenger plane and instead do it yourself because fuck experts in their fields, specialization is for betas.</p>
<p>Pretend all you want, 4+ million people are still dead from this virus. Facts don’t need your belief to be true.</p>

<p>No, that's marketing.</p>
<p>"This is the way it's always been done, therefore this is the only way it can be done" is not scientific evidence.  It's the opposite of science.</p>
<p>&rt;Deferring to experts in fields you are not sufficiently knowledgeable in is not an appeal to authority falicy.</p>
<p>"I'll let them make the call there" &lt;- that's an appeal to authority.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, want to see scientific evidence of a necessity.  I know we will never see that, because science could be oppose the marketing agenda.</p>
<p>On cue, here come the strawmen! Gotta love how you try to justify a fallacy with a fallacy.</p>
<p>&rt;If that were the case why bother having surgeons to defer to, why don’t you do the surgery yourself?</p>
<p>Some people do some surgery for themselves.  Some people go without surgery that is not necessary.   Independently; NO surgery should be done without necessity.  Some surgeons have proposed and performed unnecessary surgery.</p>
<p>&rt;Or why bother with mechanics to fix our cars when that’s just an appeal to authority?</p>
<p>A lot of people do their own mechanic work.  You didn't know that?  A lot of mechanics have proposed and performed unnecessary mechanic work.</p>
<p>&rt;Or why bother deferring to airline pilots to fly the passenger plane and instead do it yourself because fuck experts in their fields, specialization is for betas.</p>
<p>A lot of people that are not airline pilots have a pilot license.  You didn't know that?  Some airline pilots have made deadly piloting errors.</p>
<p>There are reasons why appeal to authority and strawman arguments are fallacies.</p>
<p>Long before cowpox, some humans had knowledge of ordinary ways to prevent, mitigate, or supress disease processes.  With no communication technology, that knowledge wasn't wide spread.  In the modern era, some of the knowledge, and a lot more, has been studied in great detail and the knowledge and evidence that has survived the scientific method is readily available.</p>
<p>More fundamentally; in times more modern than cowpox, we've studied a WHOLE LOT about the human immune system, in great detail.  We've learned a LOT about ordinary requirements that it has to be able to function at all.  We've learned that significant portions of the population do not get even the bare minimums of one or more of those requirements, much less the good healthy amounts our immune systems require.</p>
<p>Science is about, among other things; building on science, identifying the correct problem to solve, and solving it is the most sensible way.</p>
<p>Vaccines are an extraordinary measure.  There may have been a time when they were the only possible way, but apparently your mind is stuck some 200 years ago.  Science has learned a lot since then.</p>
<p>Science is not about coming up with whatever extraordinary measures you can.  Marketing is about coming up with whatever seems marketable, regardless of what science does or does not say on the topic.</p>
<p>The problem has <em>never been</em> a lack of vaccine induced antibodies for this respiratory virus.</p>
<p>The problem obviously has been that some people's immune systems develop disease processes after infection with this virus.</p>
<p>By far most people do NOT.</p>
<p>Therefore the problem is in those people that develop disease processes.</p>
<p>In science, we examine the relevant scientific knowledge.  In this case: what we know about the human immune system.  We see if there are ordinary things that are not being properly applied.</p>
<p>If there are, we first properly apply the ordinary and then see if a meaningful problem remains.</p>
<p>In your pseudoscience marketing, you ignore all science that might oppose your marketing agenda.  You're dismissive of it, you ridicule it, you lie about it even to the point of watching people die to ensure that marketing woowoo isn't opposed.</p>
<p>What I've described is how SCIENCE advances.  Everything you're talking about is how MARKETING advances.</p>
<p>Eagerly anticipating your next fallacy.</p>

        <p>I am not vaccinated but not anti-vax. I obv dont have the expertise to comment on studies like this, but what I do know is there are always studies that come to different conclusions, depending whats being studied, tested etc.</p>
<p>A good example for me is studies about diet/food. Rapeseed oil is hailed as being super healthy when studied in a lab bc its high in unsaturated fat, but in the real world it oxidizes almost immediately when bottled, not to mention when its heated on a pan it forms free radicals that are very unhealthy. Obv this doesnt correlate with this study, but this is my train of thought about the scientific process. You cant come to a 100% conclusion on one study. </p>
<p>There are studies that show the spike protein being a pathogen on its own and it showing up in different organs in high amounts. Im not saying this is true or a problem but to illustrate my earlier point.</p>
<p>I want to see real world results for a while longer before thinking about getting vaccinated against this new sars.</p>
<p>At this point I think vaccinating the risk groups and elderly is a good idea, and we should stop at that.</p>

        <p>This study is exactly why I am uncomfortable with the vaccine being pushed on us. It was just completed in July. I want complete efficacy and transparency. There aren’t studies on how the vaccine responds to people with autoimmune diseases according to the CDC, yet they encourage you to get the vaccine anyway. They present the public with data that makes the vaccine appear more effective than it really is, but a little research shows they only count breakthrough cases if you are dead or dying in a hospital. They say unvaccinated people are causing mutations, but fail to mention that vaccines cause mutations, too. They created a false sense of security with this vaccine and now I am personally seeing fully vaccinated people getting very sick and spreading it to other vaccinated people. I want nothing more than to have a little shit that can end all this horrible COVID-19 nightmare, but I also want to be a critical thinker and not be told by my government that this is what’s best for me....do it. I think they are desperate to stop the spread. It’s not fully FDA approved, only on an emergency basis. I want long term studies. So far, I’m not impressed with how the vaccine is going.</p>
