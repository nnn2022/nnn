        <p>One thing I have always known is that McDonalds cares about me and my health. One of my earliest memories is seeing a McDonald's commercial where fried chicken nuggets with faces dunk themselves in various sauces at a weird basketball game for my enjoyment. If those fine people don't have my best interests at heart, I don't know who does.</p>

        <p>This is what is very worrying and disturbing. As the pandemic wanes, they keep enacting more dystopia. Businesses and local/state governments everywhere now requiring masks in late July and early August. This is why I fear this nightmare will never end, and this crap will just be the new way of life. I try to have hope that this will all come to a sudden and abrupt end in early November, like people here keep saying. But seeing shit like this and how they keep becoming even more fanatical about masks and social distancing and even having new lockdowns in some places...it all gives me a deep sense of hopelessness and despair.</p>

        <p>Yep, I share your sentiments. As hospitalizations and deaths are on a decline, they've been ramping up with more restrictions instead of less. Although I'm not entirely convinced this will end with the election. The hints they keep dropping about the vaccine, and "predicting" that this will go on into 2021 leads me to believe they plan to continue this for far longer.</p>
<p>In this specific instance, with more businesses requiring masks now, I am very much convinced this is either pure virtue signaling, and/or part of some kind of upheaval of society that "everyone else" is in on. Note how they enact these new requirements days later, instead of immediately. If this was a true health emergency, Walmart and McDonalds would require masks the next day, not more than a week after the announcement.</p>

        <p>Yep! So frustrating how corporations are like, well our mask mandate starts two weeks from now! And I’m also worried that this won’t end with the election. Many stores have already been making announcements that they are cancelling Black Friday or that they won’t be open on Thanksgiving when they are usually open on that date.</p>

        <p>Yep. I'm seeing these cancellations as well. Even stuff into early 2021 is being cancelled already. It doesn't give me much confidence that normal is coming back due to the election. Something else is going on here.</p>

        <p>It's been clear for a while now that there is something nefarious going on here. Notice how the more that is known,( i.e. all the serological studies, finding out that this virus has an IFR similar to the common flu, deaths on the decline for many weeks now, places like most of Europe and Northeast U.S. reaching herd immunity, etc etc) the more that the draconian and dystopian measures increased, not decreases or were reversed...the more the media disinfo campaign and social media hysteria got even worse.  If this shit had truly been about a virus it would have been over at the end of April. Instead, all the science, data, and facts were ignored, dismissed, and ultimately, silenced...and society continued acting like this was an apocalyptic plague, governments and media continued the false narrative and even intensified it. This is why I believe there is definitely an agenda going on and that this was never really about a virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have to agree. Once the Easter "deadline" came, and went, I knew for certain something fishy was going on, and as more time goes on, and more data comes to light, it seems the fear campaign and restrictions are ramping up more. The worst part is that the general public is falling for this, and don't seem to care about life as they know it changing. Even in these subs, like this one, about people questioning the new normal and the lockdowns, I see and receive comments denouncing anything going on. It's <strong>all</strong> attributed to governing bodies just "misinterpreting" the facts, and merely trying to protect people in a misguided manner. I find that line of thinking extremely naive, especially now after 5+ months of this nonsense. They know what they are doing, this is clearly not just a goofy fuck-up from the government and the media.</p>

        <p>I can't believe that after all this crap, many people on here still think the media and politicians are just bumbling incompetent fools who "made mistakes" and don't want to admit it. The world isn't cupcakes and balloons, and to live in the delusion that all these bad things happen due to stupidity and mistakes is beyond naive. Look at the media and politicians, everything they have said and everything they have done...the language they use. The blatant and deliberate lies, manipulation tactics, fearmongering, gaslighting. On top of that, you can also get that there are many foreign bots/agents/shills on the internet and social media that spread misinformation, cause chaos and confusion, and stoke the mass hysteria. There's definitely something rotten going on, some sort of agenda that the media and DNC is doing on the homefront (I mean come on the reaction to the BLM protests should have left absolutely no doubt) while a completely separate larger agenda is going on to weaken/destroy the West. Playing the fool is how they get away with everything...Every. Single. Time.</p>

        <p>Maybe it's me, and I'm just a moron as many here claim I am, but I believe if the politicians truly overestimated the virus and it was all a huge mistake, they would've hastily re-opened things but also repeat how the "curve was flattened" after a few weeks, and that would be that. The fact they continue to extend deadlines, and <strong>add</strong> restrictions makes me believe there is more going on. I thought that was kind of obvious, but people keep claiming that what's happening is governors/politicians covering their asses... But covering their asses how, at this point?</p>

        <p>Nope, you're definitely on to something. This should have been completely over by mid/late April. At that point, it became clear that there had been a massive overreaction. But instead...what did they do? They deliberately dismissed all data that went against the narrative and continued on...and kept enacting more and more draconian policies and acting like the virus was even deadlier. There is no doubt at this point that they are doing this all on purpose. They aren't covering their asses, like you say, if this was all just a big mistake, they would have quickly reversed course completely and weaseled their way out of their collosal mistakes in April. The fact this monster just kept growing and growing really shows that this was no stupid, but innocent/honest mistake that just happened because they were looking at very faulty data. This was all by design. Why else would they still be deliberately lying to and manipulating the public at this point?</p>

        <p>Nothing official yet, but some major chains such as Walmart are stating that they won’t be open on Thanksgiving and there have been a lot of doomer articles about how Black Friday “may never look the same”.</p>

        <p>&rt;The hints they keep dropping about the vaccine, and "predicting" that this will go on into 2021 leads me to believe they plan to continue this for far longer.</p>
<p>Yep.  The fact that there are news reports on any vaccines (never mind that no one ever has successfully created a vaccine for a coronavirus, nor that any successfully deployed vaccines take <em>years</em>, not months to get to market...this isn't like transistors, biology doesn't exactly follow Moore's Law), makes people follow the sunken cost fallacy just a little bit more.</p>
<p>It's like you're a mistress and the guy keeps telling you, "I can't leave my wife just yet, not the right time, but I will soon.  But keep seeing me anyway!"</p>
<p>Yeah, no.  Your best bet is to get the hell out of that situation.</p>

        <p>I don’t understand either, I mean it’s proven that this virus has a 99.6% survival rate or something close to that so why the hysteria at all?  I have no idea why people can’t look at that survival rate and say hey this isn’t what they made it out to be in March let’s move on.</p>
<p>The new thing instead of the media harping on deaths and cases is the vaccine. You know the quick rushed vaccine that give us life sometime in 2021.</p>
