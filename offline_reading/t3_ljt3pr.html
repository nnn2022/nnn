    <strong>The psychological effects of social isolation on young children</strong>
    <p><p>My girlfriend, who lives in a heavily locked down major metro area, went over to her cousin's house recently to have dinner and celebrate the lunar new year. Her cousin and his wife have two kids, one around 5 years old and the other around 2 years old. Neither has had access to any kind of in person school or day care since last March.</p>
<p>My girlfriend described to me how her cousin's kids reacted to seeing her (for the first time in over a year). The 5 year old was SO excited to see her and wanted to talk and hang out with her the entire time she was there. "She kept climbing on me and cried when I left". That alone is kind of sad. I still worry about that kid not having any real pre-school or playground environment to hang out with other kids, but I'm glad she was able to enjoy time with her cousin and let that be a bright spot in her life.</p>
<p>What my gf said about the 2 year old, though, broke my heart. He didn't recognize her (to be expected, I guess, since he was barely more than an infant when they last met). But not only that - he couldn't stop crying and kept running back to his mom. This went on basically any time my gf tried to approach him. He was so unaccustomed to seeing a strange face that he didn't know how to handle it and was just constantly afraid. He's had basically zero socialization outside of his family for the entirety of his life since saying his first words. Over the course of the 4+ hours she was at their house, it never got any better. Even with his mom holding him and reassuring him, he still cried every time my gf got close.</p>
<p>What are we doing to these poor kids? Will they be scarred forever by this experience? How can we help them recover now and in the future?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, this is a fucking disaster. I’ve got a two year old as well. I let him get out and play at the playground with other kids whenever the weather is decent or we see someone. </p>
<p>Parents who isolate their kids are really fucking up. They’ll pay for it later</p>

        <p>It's just plenty of kids grow up in poor situations and turn out fine. As someone who's studied child development for years I can assure you the vast majority will be okay. There will be a few who are overly affected due to specific personality types, environmental factors, parenting style etc. But most will be okay. Don't worry.</p>
