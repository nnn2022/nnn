        <p>Okay - so - as somebody who is non-Jewish but a very big fan of the Jewish people, I want to clear up a few things.</p>
<p>First of all, this isn’t simply “Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods”. It’s mostly Hasidic neighborhoods we’re talking about. For some of you who don’t know, Judaism comes in many different shades of religious strictness, ranging from people who don’t even go to shul or keep kosher, to people who are “shomar nagilia” (they don’t touch people of the opposing gender), and keep “shomar shabbos” (they don’t do work or use electronics from sundown on the Sabbath - Friday night to sundown on Saturday night - and instead relax and spend time with families). The Hasidics are basically Orthodox Jews on crack - they do every regulation in the Torah and then some. They’re the MOST strict, but a LOT.</p>
<p>Regular Orthodox Jews will wear a kippah and some married women will cover up their natural hair to people outside their family (usually with wigs) - but the Hasidics are the ones who wear all black and white, have the curls on the side of their face. When you see them, you know. </p>
<p>Unlike regular Orthodox Jews who fit into regular society, the Hasidics shun outside society as much as possible. Herein lies the rub, and both the positive and negative parts of the Hasidic community during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Bill de Blasio, when he was just a regular city councilman (prior to being mayor), activity courted the Hasidic vote - and got it - because it seems they thought he was the candidate most likely to leave them alone. They’re an extremely powerful voting bloc in their local communities. A few years ago, there was a small outbreak of herpes amongst newborn baby boys. In some Hasidic communities, it was a tradition during the bris (the ritual of circumcising a newborn baby boy) that the mohel (usually the rabbi, but the performer of the circumcision) would clean up the blood by sucking it through a straw. Kinda gross. Well! This is actually not illegal in NY State (or NYC) because even after a few baby boys got herpes from it the Hasidics lobbied de Blasio, their friend, to leave them alone - and they won.</p>
<p>The Hasidics also primarily converse / communicate in Yiddish, not English, and their schools do not follow the same curriculum of NY State. They’re managed to find ways to carve out their own little outposts where they live, and work the existing laws to their advantage. They do not usually converse or trust anybody outside of their community.</p>
<p>Hasidics also shun electronic communication like the way we all use it, so lockdown was much harder for them (less to district them), so in April they kinda just stopped doing it. COVID ripped through the Hasidic communities, and there were numerous published reports ripping on them for having large public funerals for rabbis who died of COVID. However, they were the largest supplier of COVID-antibody plasma in NY State and infections seemed to peter out amongst them.</p>
<p>de Blasio never seemed to really understand the Hasidics only supported him when he was useful to them and is probably kinda pissed they’re not listening to him and making him look bad in front of Daddy Cuomo, but they were never going to listen to anybody that they didn’t want to.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the new “outbreaks” are related to people gathering from Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur (two weeks ago and one week ago respectively), or if it’s mostly false positives brought about from dead virus testing.</p>
<p>But it’s a lot more nuanced than “de Blasio is anti-Semitic”. These populations <em>are</em> causing an increase in cases, but nobody seems to be looking into the why or how serious it is. Quite possibly another casedemic, could be cases from visiting family from Rosh Hashanah who weren’t immune yet.</p>
<p>Also it’s stupid to shut down all of Sheepshead Bay when de Blasio and Cuomo know damn well the Hasidics stay among themselves and aren’t exactly going to the neighborhood bar to hang with the boys</p>

        <p>In Christianity you can find many ends of the spectrum from Anabaptists to Evangelicals. Jared Kushners <a href="https://forward.com/news/359482/kushner-foundation-gives-342k-to-chabad-still-surprised-about-jared-and-iva/">Chabad</a> sect is very similar to christian evangelicals in it's implacable desire to roust the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Remember Lev Parnes' hidden camera messianic prophesies? <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-parnas-and-fruman-compare-trump-to-messiah/">https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-recording-parnas-and-fruman-compare-trump-to-messiah/</a></p>
<p>No corner of religion can represent the whole, but across the world I am sick and tired of extremists from several religions who want to end the world. I know the Jewish people will be leaders against the tyranny imposed. I have a strange fantasy of The A-Team comprised entirely of Jewish superheros... The J-Team?</p>
<p>I hope it's not appalling to write this, because I see so much antisemitic crap online and it's really gross. I truly hope I'm not part of the problem with my hopes for the J-Team.</p>
