    <strong>Building An Alternative To New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in the UK, but regardless of which country you are in, you've probably realised your government has a pre-planned agenda to radically transform society and railroad us all into this "New Normal".</p>
<p>And sadly, it appears that in most places, the majority of people actually believe the government.  Large protests have taken place, but the great mass of the population are either unaware of them or simply ignore them.  Most people seem to think that if they comply with their government, then things "will go back to normal in the end".  They are deluded to think this.</p>
<p>I do not think that we can stop the governments of the world carrying out their plans.</p>
<p>There seems to be nowhere to run: they have made emigration effectively impossible, and besides, where would we go?  The "New Normal" is clearly a global agenda.</p>
<p>It appears that the only option left is to establish a kind of parallel society within our own countries.  Those of us who refuse the shots will be essentially "un-personed" anyway ---- and will possibly soon be subject to physical attacks from the more unhinged and terrified members of the public.</p>
<p>People who refuse the shots will probably have to either find new jobs or become self-employed.</p>
<p>And if things get really bad, then perhaps the only option will be to leave the population centres and form our own communities out in the countryside.  ...This doesn't guarantee we'll be left alone by the government, of course, but our chances of being left alone in cities and towns are zero.</p>
<p>Anyone have any thoughts on this?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm already looking into moving to the countryside. A parallel society would be the only way to do it.</p>

        <p>This reminds me of the WEF piece, “own nothing and be happy”. They mention that everyone lives in high tech cities under survaillance, but a few people live outside the cities away the technology. That will be us. Soon that will be the only option left for those who refuse the vaccine and vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>Prepping for SHTF scenario right now, in any case that could help enormously. I also want to move to the countryside with my family and start self-sustaining permaculture and homesteading life as soon as military is deployed in my area.</p>
