    <strong>Please. Answer. My. Question. About. Cheeseburgers.</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve worked in fast food. I know they do gross shit. I watched people rub their faces and touch food all day long. I‚Äôve worked in food during the pandemic and NOBODY changed their gloves. Ever ever ever ever ever. ‚ÄúBut the virus isn‚Äôt transmissible by food‚Äù. What??? So, you‚Äôre telling me that if I spit in your face, you‚Äôll get the virus, but if I spit in your food, you won‚Äôt? Lemme give you an example. I buss a table and touch forks that have been in someone‚Äôs mouth. I don‚Äôt wash my hands. Then I touch your food (getting trace amounts of spit on your food) and then you eat the food. Another scenario. I wipe my nose. Then I touch the wrapper on your McDonald‚Äôs cheeseburger. Then you touch the wrapper... then you touch the cheeseburger. Are you telling me this is safe? Are you telling me this is fucking safe? If it‚Äôs safe, then why in the Fuck is the gym still closed in my area? Food gets put in peoples bodies! If someone sanitizes a treadmill every time someone gets off, there‚Äôs no risk! Where‚Äôs the risk? If we social distance and use bleach, wtf if the problem! Ohhhh no the gym isn‚Äôt safe... but cheeseburgers with snot on them are fine. Cause didn‚Äôt you know? McDonald‚Äôs protects you against the virus! It‚Äôs essential! Yeah, fuck everybody.</p></p>

        <p>Realize- it's BULLSHIT! Yes, you "may" be able to contract a virus through touch. You have about the same chance &amp; "may" win the lottery or be killed by a meteorite. </p>
<p>Gyms are closed because billionaires said so. Planet Fitness is "essential" though &amp; remains open because they have a billionaire that said so. </p>
<p>I know reality, but you (should) know regulations. If you get caught spitting on people's food, that is a fine. If you spit on people, that is assault.</p>

        <p>I've worked for a very short time at Mc.Donalds. It was so disgusting that I didn't last more than a couple weeks before I couldn't take it anymore and quit. The gloves you wear all the time barely get changed and if you do they get nasty in minutes anyways especially your on the grill like I was cooking the red goo mystery meat that I refuse to call food. Things are barely cleaned, there is just no time to, Plastic touch hot sources everywhere which is obviously doing to leech into food. Everything that gets cooked from this fake food goes into the greasy air too, I would go home with a headache every day. But yet these same people that push for masks and distancing have no problem going to places like this and eating the stuff that is anything but clean. No one needs fast food.</p>

        <p>I think the difference is in the exposure route. The main exposure route for COVID and other similar respiratory illnesses is through inhalation, thus the current mask craze. If you ingest the virus by eating, your digestive process destroys the virus.</p>

        <p>The main root cause of all disease is <strong>toxicity</strong>. The body heals itself when it receives the right nutrients, disease is not transmissible, viruses are exosomes ‚Äî which are the <em>result</em> of disease, not the cause ‚Äî and <strong>all pharma is poison</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, no "virus" has ever been proven to cause any disease.</p>
<p>Everything that's happened during Covid, and in all the other "pandemics" in the last century, has been a psy-op, based on <strong>lies</strong>, with the ultimate goal of total control over the masses.</p>
