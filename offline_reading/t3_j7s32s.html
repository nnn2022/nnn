        <p>Doomers are part of that crowd that’s claims to be against climate change but would look for any excuse not to take transit. They now likely  think it’s selfish to take it. “Just use an SUV bro”</p>

        <p>Honestly the quiet trains in recent months have been nice. But it's not sustainable, and I worry about the future of transit right now.</p>

        <p>Yes, they did.  I couldn't believe my eyes when Metro, at the beginning of the pandemic, was posting on their social media channels showing how far down the ridership was compared to the previous year, and how those numbers were still too high, and that they wanted to see the ridership drop even lower.  That was the stupidest thing that they could have ever said.  My first thought upon seeing that was that they would drive off the riders, and they would not come back.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but I'm a train operator.  I need to have people to transport in order to earn a living, and I don't like it when the people at headquarters are actively trying to drive away the ridership that I depend on in order to make that living.  After all, if there are no riders, there's no need for trains.  All of these doomers telling everyone to stay home is killing me.  We need people out and going to work and such, because without that, we will kill a significant piece of transportation infrastructure in the national capital region.</p>

        <p>The worse thing is that wmata does not care anymore because they get dedicated funding.</p>

        <p>WMATA drove passengers away a long time ago, before covid-19. covid-19 is just another nail in the coffin. WMATA offers the worst mass public transit service in the world, and that's being generous. if you look in the dictionary and go to "train wreck," you'll see a picture of WMATA.</p>

<p>if you want to know the truth about WMATA and public transit in DC, look at unsuckdcmetro on Twitter and his blog. you cannot trust the media shills from the Washington Post, WAMU, or WTOP - metro journos are beholden to WMATA for some unknown reason (money) and they will never report the real news (e.g. the truth).</p>
<p>look, i ride the metro on a daily basis and i have for 30 years. those of us who live in the area and work downtown can't avoid it really. obviously i've just gotten used to it, but i'm tired of the excuses. WMATA is a waste of time and money, and it's just a giant leech.</p>
<p>and don't get me started on the union.</p>
