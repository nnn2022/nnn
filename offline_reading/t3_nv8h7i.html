    <strong>Why force vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>S/
to build herd immunity and save lives! 
Once everyone is vaccinated we can return to the good ole days!
Trust the government,  they will save us from this evil disease!
Half million dead, get it or you are a danger to us all! </p>
<p>Real talk: 
I hold several things as fact, and as far as my conspiracy theory brothers and sisters are concerned... just because it's a conspiracy theory doesn't mean it's wrong. However... some things are WAY more likely.  Consider if you will these follow points as fact:
1. Government is full, if not entirely made up of, under performing lazy inept individuals. (See any government agency 
...mva, DMV, Social security admin, etc...
2. Government is ONLY proficient at covering their own ass to protect the golden goose of an unearned paycheck,  and growing itself to wrap more CYA tax leaches into the fold. </p>
<p>Knowing 1 and 2, I have come to a pretty understandable explanation for the past year and why the government has made the choices they have. </p>
<p>A. Lock downs and masks: the government failed to heed the warning signs and symptoms from the initial outbreak resulting in new worldwide sickness(see 2). </p>
<p>Mostly the liberals but the conservatives are equally culpable (see 1 above). Once they realized how massively they screwed up, they over corrected and pumped fear out as much and in every way possible, 'one-up'ing each other in a sick game of "who can enact the most dramatic solution and grab the lime light as the hero". Think arms race, but instead of weapons it was "mandates that would have the most visibility of government competency. What better way to ensure public trust than to have everyone wearing it on their face. Remind the people how much they need us, we dont want to get fired. If we back track too soon, they'll realize we fkd up the solution as bad as the response. </p>
<p>B. Vaccines: dont flash forward just yet, remain with me if you will in march of 2020. You have a vaccine actually being worked on at that time. Some reports say that the science of mRNA vaccines have been in the works for over a decade but until now it did not show a great enough profit margin to get the ball really rolling. </p>
<p>Government officials throw desperate lines out to every pipette and beaker jockey on planet earth to say "whatever the hell you're working on,  you are green lit to find us ANYTHING". So the race was on. By the end of the summer 2020, officials began to see the negative impact lockdowns were having and realized their mistake. Crap... masks dont work, they're causing more harm than good, how can we walk back before it gets too bad?</p>
<p>Enter the Medical Oligarchy. "We have a solution that has some promise! And it's got a great margin for us! Ignore all those cheap simple solutions", So without any long term studies or official FDA approval,  the government approved these vaccines for emergency use. Government to the rescue! And the ones funding the government officials get paid and the government reps get to be the heros.</p>
<p>Conclusion:
Why vaccine? Government shit the bed, they all need to be fired and replaced. They are fighting like hell to not let us as a people realize it. Can't push alternatives because it won't make their constituency enough money. </p>
<p>Covid exists,  it's not remotely as bad as we've been told, and certainly not bad enough to risk an unproven vaccine on anyone younger than 65. If you are over 65, maybe you decide to risk it. Good. Its YOUR choice. But before you go forcing me to get it.</p>
<p>Answer me this:</p>
<p>Is there definitive PROOF,  that recieving this vaccine will prevent me from getting infected or spreading the infection? I will not experience any longterm negative effects or my offspring should I choose to have more children? If that answer is NO, then I should be allowed to wait as see what happens to those who choose to get it.</p>
<p>Before you answer know this, I am a Paramedic in a major metropolitan department,  I've watched people die with this disease and I was the only one there holding their hand as they died. (60yoF DNR/DNI order, positive for covid, heart stopped as we pulled up to the ER)</p>
<p>I've even had a fellow firefighter die because of it. 
I simply do not trust the government.</p>
<p>This is a natural DISASTER, like Katrina, like superstorm sandy and so many other major events the government just can not handle. </p>
<p>TL;DR
Gov'ment lazy, dumb and self serving.  All answers can be traced back to these jokers CYA and Overreaction early on. Because of that fact, I'm going to wait and see how this vaccine effects those with a greater risk tolerance than me.</p></p>

        <p>Based on the MHRA data, here in the UK we are averaging 5.7 deaths a day caused by the "vaccines" not including any other non fatal adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile yesterday we only had 1 death of someone who "tested positive for Covid-19 within 28 days"</p>
<p>Take from that what you will.</p>
<p>(Remember also we know that yellow card reporting even for deaths is grossly under reported, at most 10% get reported... we also know that Covid-19 death figures are exaggerated...)</p>

        <p>And most deaths from vaccines are young people with decades ahead of them.</p>
<p>Most deaths from covid have other comorbidities and &lt;1 year expectation.</p>

        <p>I think these vaccines were rushed out as experimental to prevent it from being mandatory until the clinical trials are done. I think this gave the Pharmaceutical Industrial Complex enough rope to expose and hang themselves. If this were any other product, it would be pulled with how many adverse events have occures already. What are the implications for intentionally suppressing an effective treatment? Crimes against humanity?</p>

        <p>Because point blank I think these 'vaccines' are something else entirely. They've never pushed anything this hard before. So there's obviously a reason they want everyone to take it so bad. And there's not an ounce of altruistic intentions in the government much less the pharma companies. They've got something to gain from it. </p>
<p>What? I'm not sure yet. Experimentation of some sort is my guess. Time will tell.</p>

        <p>It plays with your RNA and other genetic code. It's not a vaccine, it's far more invasive than that. I'd say you're right, this is experimentation on a grand scale. Does it seem like an Orwellian science fiction? It kinda does for me.</p>
