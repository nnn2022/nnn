    <strong>Hate to be depressed, but</strong>
    <p><p>Last year, I was a junior in high school. When covid hit, they shut the school down and forced us to switch to online learning, which wasn’t even learning, it was just waking up to 15 different assignments due and turning them in. Our school has a lot of reward programs for juniors and seniors, that start in the spring, so it was finally nice to enter that threshold and we were all excited for the events and new experiences. Well, SIKE! We didn’t get to experience that. </p>
<p>I wasn’t too worried since we could experience those things next year as seniors, which is what I am now. And it wasn’t that bad for seniors last year, because they already experienced those rewards and events their junior year. Well this year has pretty much already been cancelled for us seniors. While we’re going to school in person, they cancelled practically everything but sports. No field trips, college expos, dances, etc. I was hoping that by next semester we would get those things back because, hey, we didn’t get to experience them out junior year, so if we don’t experience them our senior year, we won’t at all. </p>
<p>Seeing as Biden and Harris are the expected Elect administration, I can almost certainly throw away any hope for getting a senior year. Like junior year, my senior year will be cancelled. We will lose the experience and involvement on those things. It is extremely depressing to know that these great things have been robbed from us. </p>
<p>And when I and others try to bring this up to people in control (older people who already GOT to experience these things) they give some BS emphatic speech about either “we’re in this together” or they just completely dismiss it and basically say “that’s tough” it makes me feel so isolated and depressed seeing all these things we deserve get torn away and the people in charge don’t care because it doesn’t affect them. </p>
<p>I already suffer from clinical depression so I can’t wait for the next lockdown to push me further down a dark hole. :)</p></p>

        <p>Yes, I have to agree. Guys here are just as much shut-ins as the doomers then they come to whine about how much their lives suck. But going outside and actually living life would do them wonders. </p>
<p>OP, stop being a whiny loser and live your life! Be patient and 2021 will be an amazing year!</p>

<p>Do you live in a rural area. have enough money to get something fun like a dirtbike?</p>
<p>I'm paraphrasing but George Carlin once said something along the lines of the main thing American manufactures is bullshit world class top of line bullshit but bullshit nonetheless!!</p>
<p>People need to be taught to avoid this bullshit and not let it affect their lives! </p>
<p>In one ear out the other!</p>
<p>I assume you are referring to public school! Don't worry about the "reward programs" or any other treatment they use to coax you into good behavior! </p>
<p>public schools are full of indoctrination, you seem like you have managed to power through it though! That depression you are feeling is only natural the world is a depressing place my friend!</p>
<p>Try not to let it get you down!</p>
<p>Just remember always question authority! don't fall victim to logical, fallacies like "that's the way it is". "Because I said so" or the all-time classic"its the law"</p>

        <p>I can relate. Last year, I was a freshman entering high school. It was fun for the majority of the year, until march hit. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting people to actually put up with this for this long. I thought they would say fuck you when summer happened, but it didn’t happen. When school switched and everything got cancelled, It was kind of a downward trip. Couldn’t see my friends and lost some of them due to my opinions on the lockdown, couldn’t see my girlfriend either cause her parents are paranoid as fuck from the virus, and couldn’t do my sport. Was even worse too, because I live in California. And it was the same thing with other people too, I got told some BS about empathy from people I didn’t know. However, I somehow didn’t fall into a depression from all this. Or maybe I have and just don’t realize it. Idk. But either way, I have tried my best to keep my chin up and be hopeful. And honestly, you should too. Cause biden and harris will not actually be president and Vice President. The voter fraud that happened and all the other shady things will be challenged, we’ll have fraudulent votes thrown out and have it recounted in many states, and I predict, by the end of December, we will keep trump in. Do not lose hope my friend. It is not the end, and I wish you the best, because I know how it feels like to be absolutely hopeless and in the dark place you are right now, but we will not fail in our mission for freedom. Not if we never stop. You are just as valuable to the mission for freedom of all as we all are. Keep going my friend, because good always triumphs over evil in the end, and I know we will win.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I really enjoyed high school and the few perks we got in the last month of senior year. It’s not fair at all. A lot of us had very special things in our lives that are gone. Those things might pick back up eventually but missing school in person with the many events it heartbreaking. Music kids won’t have marching band and concerts. Sports kids won’t get to compete. Clubs may not meet or will meet on video, which is scarcely a replacement. I also feel bad for people planning weddings and wanting baby showers. Milestones in our lives.</p>

        <p>I hated high school and graduated a year early to get out of it but I would still take it any day over this online learning bs. I think I was just being overly dramatic and the goth kid that “nobody understands”, looking back on it. I still made some amazing friends who I still talk to.</p>

        <p>Yep.  This thing we look at hours on end every day is an appendage that can be laid down and walked away from.  It’s brainwashing us with fear and doom. I’m just as guilty but if many many of us collectively can shut this off and do other things....it will change so much.  Social media is killing civilization and making humans feral.</p>
