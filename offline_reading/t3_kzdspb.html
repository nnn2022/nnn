    <strong>Getting tired of missing work every time I'm "exposed" to Covid. Next time, I'm going to catch it in purpose.</strong>
    <p><p>So far at my job, we've had 3 or 4 covid outbreaks. Each time somebody tests positive, the higher-ups identify everyone they worked with in the previous WEEK, and don't let those people come back into work until they get a negative test result. Which (if no symptoms) can't be taken until 5-7 days post exposure, and then it takes another 2-3 days for results to come in. It's happened to me twice, and I've now lost almost 2 weeks worth of income for nothing. It also puts a huge strain on the remaining staff that have to cover all the vacant shifts.</p>
<p>So I've decided: next time I have to dance the quarantine jig because I was "exposed" to somebody who tested positive, I'm going to visit them for a couple hours to seal the deal. Catch covid, get better, get antibodies, and never deal with this nonsense again. I'm 25 and healthy, so the only downside is possibly losing my taste and smell for a while. Yeah I'll have to quarantine slightly longer when I'm positive, but it's better than 2, 3, 4... more false alarms that keep wasting my time and income. I'll end up catching this virus at some point anyways, so why not do it on my terms?</p>
<p>Has anybody else done something similar?</p></p>

        <p>Low key I tried to “bug chase” for Covid and it’s VERY hard to get... All through the summer, meeting friends and family through the holidays and also having a ton of contacts through a retail job in one of the “hardest hit” quadrant of my city... I haven’t gotten it.</p>
<p>I’m not a health nut or anything like that, obviously don’t wear a mask for personal contacts and just a work/when required and it’s... probably not as contagious as people think. I don’t monitor my contacts or anything and obviously have a lot of unknown contacts from working at a mall. But, it’s either extremely hard to get “organically” or you need someone VERY sick to make out with you to get it.</p>

        <p>I've done a similar thing, I guess living like an animal for 30+ years has left my immune system too strong for this cold.  We probably had it and fought it off with no symptoms, I don't know how I wouldn't have caught it by now.</p>

        <p>I've started donating blood to the Red Cross every 8 weeks. With each donation, they test your blood for antibodies. Granted, those tests aren't 100% accurate, but it's better than nothing. Wouldn't be surprised at all if I get the 'vid and never have symptoms.</p>

        <p>due to the way the tests work its highly likely you will test positive even if you have antibodies from getting Covid for real, so purposly trying to get it isnt going to do any good</p>

        <p>I'm a vendor for a huge company and our company policy is that we are supposed to report to HR if we've been around anyone who's been exposed, and we have to quarantine for 14 days. Of course, they don't pay us sick leave when we have to quarantine.  Please tell me how someone is supposed to live missing weeks of pay. I live paycheck to paycheck.  I'm still trying to financially recover from having to take a week off work when my son passed, not due to covid, and I had to max out my credit cards for his cremation, so there's no way I can miss 14 days with no pay. I've worked 10 years for this company &amp; didn't even get a simple "I'm sorry for your loss" email from any of my superiors.</p>
<p>To add even more insult the company sent us a email at the end of the year thanking us for our service and informing us this has been their most profitable year in over 2 decades. So the company is making more $ but won't give us sick pay or hazard pay. It makes me so mad.</p>
<p>In all honesty, who would actually report that they've been exposed to the virus if they know the consequences are losing 2 weeks of pay? I'm scared to say who I work for,  but my territory consists of 18 of the biggest chain stores in America.....I'm sure I've likely been exposed at work, but I haven't been sick &amp; I've actually received tons of overtime bc many of my co-workers were too "scared" to work during a pandemic. A lot of my co-workers chose to sit out of work bc they made more $ collecting unemployment.</p>

        <p>At this point, I think we all need to contract it in order for it to slow down. You can't hide from a highly contagious virus forever. I'm sorry your workplace made you go through that.</p>
