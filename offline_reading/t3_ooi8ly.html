    <p><p>Vaccinated are at higher risk of flu AND all illness:</p>
<p>A 2011 study found that seasonal flu shots increase the risk of flu by 73% and doubled the risk of non-flu respiratory infections.</p>
<p>https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e318201811c</p>
<p>A 2011 study confirmed that annual influenza vaccination indeed hampers the development of a robust cell-mediated immunity. Annual vaccination for influenza, “may render young children who have not previously been infected with an influenza virus more susceptible to infection with a pandemic influenza virus of a novel subtype.”</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3209321/</p>
<p>A 2018 study found there was an increase of acute respiratory infections caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens following influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children.</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18303153?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Children who get the flu vaccine have 3x the risk of being hospitalized for flu.</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090519172045.htm</p>
<p>A 2014 study found that the more the people had been vaccinated in prior years, the less effective the vaccine is at preventing the most recent season’s dominant H3N2 virus.</p>
<p>As they put it, “vaccine-induced protection was greatest for individuals not vaccinated during the prior 5 years.”</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270645</p>
<p>Not only are there serious questions about the efficacy of the flu vaccine, there is evidence to suggest that getting the vaccine every year may cause damage to the immune system.</p>
<p>In a 2016 study, researchers found that people who were vaccinated against the flu three years in a row were actually at higher risk of being infected with the flu.</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/63/1/21/1745238</p>
<p>Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine </p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098?searchresult=1</p>
<p>A randomized controlled trial in 2012 found that influenza-vaccinated children had no significantly lessened risk from influenza and also a higher risk of infection from non-influenza viruses.</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/</p>
<p>Influenza virus made stronger by vaccines:</p>
<p>http://www.burnettcountysentinel.com/news/influenza-potentially-made-stronger-by-vaccines/article_4bd056da-0c21-11e8-b6ae-533d3d165845.html</p>
<p>Flu vaccine increases risk of upper respiratory infection:</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22423139/</p>
<p>Flu vaccine makes people &rt;6x more infectious than non-vaccinated when they contract influenza A:</p>
<p>http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115</p>
<p>2014 study - Influenza-like illness was more common in children vaccinated against influenza</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24483149</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29348203</p>
<p>A study that compared children who received the flu vaccine to those who did not found the same rate of influenza in both groups following vaccination. It also found that the group of children who received the flu vaccine had a 4.4 times higher rate of non-influenza respiratory tract infections.</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098</p>
<p>Annual influenza vaccination hampers the development of virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880755/</p>
<p>Vaccination may make flu worse if exposed to a second strain</p>
<p>https://m.medicalxpress.com/news/2013-08-vaccination-flu-worse-exposed-strain.html</p>
<p>A review in the medical journal The Lancet found a lack of health benefits from influenza vaccine in children under two along with significantly increased rates of vaccine-related adverse events.</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673605179847</p>
<p>A study published in Pediatrics International of Japanese children ages 6 months to 2 years who were vaccinated against the flu found that the influenza vaccine did not reduce the rate of influenza A infections in children under two.</p>

        <p>There are no direct studies to show what I’ve stated but I will link a couple that make it apparent imo. Just based on the first study the risk of cancer is significantly increased for those who reside nearest to oil refineries. How about daily use and indigestion? No studies found on this one yet.</p>

        <p>Thats bullshit. Yes there are corrupted doctors, but they all are also just employees with paycheck that are often forced to do things against their beliefs like vaccinating and do not earn more if more people are sick. Huge majority actually want to help people. It's really unfair to blame doctors as a whole.
It's big pharma that is pulling the strings.</p>

<p>doctors are low IQ NPCs that are abetting big pharma's scams. i have no respect for the average doctor. just like I have no respect for the average nazi abettor. if you're too stupid or cowardly to go against the mob or authority, you are literally responsible.</p>
<p>they are not smart, they are retarded NPCs just regurgitating big pharma's scams word for word. they are just intelligent enough to memorize sophisticated sounding lies.</p>
<p>they do not perform research, nor do they analyze or review research. they are just regurgitating NPCs.</p>

        <p>Medical school is extremely difficult to get into.  I’m sure you could get all As in Organic Chemistry, Biochem, etc. <br>
Doctors are some of the smartest and hardest working people on the planet.  </p>
<p>You do realize there are doctors that do research right? They just aren’t the ones you’ll see when you have a health problem.<br>
The funny part is that there were doctors involved in all of the research listed above.  This is one of those “I only trust doctors that come to a conclusion I agree with.”</p>
<p>Typical Dunning Krueger 4chan basement dweller nonsense.  You guys always fall for the “everyone else has it wrong but I know the real truth.”  And the funniest part is the “truth” you’ve found is coming from even bigger hucksters and grifters than the MSM.</p>

        <p>look its obviously dumb to give flu shots to kids and young people, no question. in europe here i dont know anyone below 70 who takes the flu shot.</p>
<p>but you even conclude that for very old people (75+), who have very weak immune system due to age, a flu shot has more risks than benefits?</p>

        <p>I believe the immune system is compromised due to the pseudo science killer medications/inoculations, not age. I’m no scientist or doctor though.</p>

        <p>😐 haha? You don’t need to be to understand what they’ve written and explained in these studies. Do you want to add something valuable to the conversation or naw?</p>

        <p>Funny. Only anecdotal but the one year I got the flu shot because the doctor basically coerced me is the one year I was off sick half the year with the flu. Just kept coming back over and over. Worst year of my life.</p>
