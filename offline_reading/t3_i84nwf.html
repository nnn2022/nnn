        <p>Oh my god this is the most offensive thing I've ever read. They seriously act like we're all livestock. </p>
<p>"Another challenge is that the defectors who need moral enhancement are also the least likely to sign up for it. As some have argued, a solution would be to make moral enhancement compulsory or administer it secretly, perhaps via the water supply. These actions require weighing other values. Does the good of covertly dosing the public with a drug that would change people’s behavior outweigh individuals’ autonomy to choose whether to participate? Does the good associated with wearing a mask outweigh an individual’s autonomy to not wear one?"</p>
<p>And this... ^</p>
<p>Can you imagine people's reactions if this was posted last year? So gross.</p>

        <p>Fear is a powerful weapon. People would have been revolted by the idea last year, but have now been induced with such fear that they would probably support this so so-called ethicist's idea. They would wish such pills existed to drug those evil people who don't or cannot wear masks, leave their home, or dare step within 1m, 1.5m, 2m, 6ft or whatever random distance is made up in the country.</p>

        <p>So this asshole has been going on about his "moral enhancement" for years, and COVID is just his latest excuse to drug people into submission? Please tell me he doesn't have any real power like Bill Gates does.</p>
<p>"the covert administration of a compulsory moral bioenhancement program better conforms to public health ethics than does an overt compulsory program"</p>
<p>No it fucking doesn't! There is nothing ethical or moral about this!</p>
<p>"a covert compulsory program promotes values such as liberty, utility, equality, and autonomy better than an overt program does"</p>
<p>No it fucking doesn't! Drugging the water is pretty much the opposite of promoting liberty and autonomy!</p>

        <p>Well....morality, neurology, biochemistry, etc are far too complex for any drug to ever provide a guaranteed effect. Such measures will always backfire in some people, such as how antidepressants may exacerbate suicidal ideation, or how nitrous oxide and certain other sedatives make me paradoxically aggressive. But that doesn't mean they won't attempt this with disastrous results.</p>

<p>No, not as far as I know (and I'm aware of a lot of pre-market biomedical stuff, though not all of course, especially not black ops stuff).  A pharmaceutical solution to this "problem" is a pipe dream:  morality is one of the most complex cognitive processes, and the state-of-the-art is still gross interference with neurotransmitters.  </p>
<p>However, I wouldn't rule out covert programs to introduce chemicals that cause blunt impairment to a large range of cognition (<em>cough</em> fluoride <em>cough</em>).  </p>
<p>However, a much more refined approach to "moral enhancement" is propaganda.  The state of the art is almost surgically precise at this point.</p>

        <p>This is horrifying and I don't know what I just read. </p>
<p>Lockdowns and the disproportionate harm being done in the name of the virus by all these measures including "social distancing" and masks being forced on people is what is immoral. </p>
<p>&rt;COVID-19 is a collective risk. It threatens everyone, and we all must cooperate to lower the chance that the coronavirus harms any one individual. </p>
<p>It does not threaten everyone. Harms any one individual? Viruses harm and kill people every single day. Harms one individual? So the unfortunate harm done by the virus - much like other viruses we live with  - to a minority of mostly elderly people is not acceptable, but enormous harm done by these choices - choices that don't even protect the at risk  - being forced on everyone including the majority not at risk to this virus is just fine?</p>
<p>What the fuck is this so-called ethicist on??? And how is the conversation up for publishing this? Oh my god.</p>
<p>&rt;When someone chooses not to follow public health guidelines around the coronavirus, they’re defecting from the public good. It’s the moral equivalent of the tragedy of the commons: If everyone shares the same pasture for their individual flocks, some people are going to graze their animals longer, or let them eat more than their fair share, ruining the commons in the process. Selfish and self-defeating behavior undermines the pursuit of something from which everyone can benefit.</p>
<p>What the heck? No, no, no. </p>
<p>There is no "public good" coming from these lockdowns and random other measures enforced on people. They don't protect the at risk, and people are being harmed.</p>

        <p>Indeed. Your point about the similarity to rapists is excellent and on-target. I will also say this person displays a glaring lack of curiosity at what many "experts" would call the "social costs" of the lockdown and the restrictions; surely a justification would need to be provided for why dying or suffering from the lockdown doesn't count as much as dying or suffering from COVID-19, yet he seems to take it as axiomatic that restrictions have zero costs (that should count morally).</p>

        <p>Got to add this point on it's own - Parker Crutchfield is an dangerous man and i would be concerned what he would be capable of if given any power.</p>
<p>&rt;Another challenge is that the defectors who need moral enhancement are also the least likely to sign up for it. As some have argued, a solution would be to make moral enhancement compulsory or administer it secretly, perhaps via the water supply. These actions require weighing other values. Does the good of covertly dosing the public with a drug that would change people’s behavior outweigh individuals’ autonomy to choose whether to participate? Does the good associated with wearing a mask outweigh an individual’s autonomy to not wear one?</p>
<p>Good associated with mask wearing? How about the fact their use in the general public isn't supported by high level science in the first place! </p>
<p>This is sick. Next level sick. Drugging people with psychotropic drugs en masse via the water supply against their will? Secretly? What the fuck.</p>
<p>People can have some terrible side effects from psychotropic drugs meant to be used to treat mental illness, they come with significant side effects ranging from mild to serious. They can have a detrimental impact on someone's physical health. Can actually worsen mental health as the effects can be unpredictable, and can increase the risk of suicide. This is especially the case in children and young people  - most psychotropic drugs aren't even recommended for young children, and he wants to drug everyone in secret via the water supply?</p>
<p>Then there's the issue of dosing - how would he control the dose? Dose is vitally important when it comes to psychopathic drugs. He wants to secretly put it in the water supply but has no control over how little or how much someone drinks. Has no control how much water an infant consumes in their formula, a toddler, a 6 year old, or an adult. Then there are the withdrawal symptoms which can show up if you miss taking psychotropic medication, sometimes within just a couple of hours. So someone who skips having water would experience withdrawals and have no idea what was wrong.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone who takes psychotropic medications experiences some side effects. How would it be ethical to do that to people, everyone would suddenly be experiencing strange symptoms and he's cool with that?</p>

        <p>It's really astonishing how little morals and ethics our so-called "ethicists" have, and this is an excellent example of how extremely authoritarian, collectivistic, and misanthropic such people tend to be. This sort of "thought experiment" among "ethicists" and other academics also has a long history predating COVID-19, and is nothing new; I have seen such proposals, usually associated with oxytocin or lithium, being floated for many years. It's merely been repurposed now for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Aside from the very important and ultimately decisive moral and human-rights-based objections to such a proposal, I would like to offer two thoughts. First of all, to say that people who reject being "safe" are "defecting from the public good" is not really accurate; after all, there are arguments that the benefits from reducing transmission are not worth the cost of precluding certain pleasurable and socially beneficial activities. Unless this "ethicist" proposed that no one should ever have had any social interaction at all, there clearly is a level of disease risk incurred by socializing that is acceptable to this person; surely he could comprehend that someone could disagree as to what that level should be. It would be much closer to the mark to say the people rejecting these restrictions have a different idea about what the public good is than he does.</p>
<p>Secondly, the "plan" to drug people en masse is quite unscientific. All a drug can do is alter the expression of personality traits, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that a given personality trait will lead to a more moral outcome. People who commit a given offense have a wide variety of personality traits, after all, and, in a more everyday example, when drunk some people act more moral whereas other people act less moral. The same dose of a given drug will also have wildly varying effects on different people depending on a variety of factors. Drugs can disable people, sure, but in real life they do not have the effect this person desires.</p>
<p>While in principle it would be possible to manipulate people's hormones and thus moods from moment to moment for conditioning purposes, you would need something a lot more sophisticated than a simple pill or drugging the water supply to do that. Even then there's no guarantee it would even work at all, since people are able to recognize if there's something very off or weird about their feelings and ignore them if they're too contrary to their established thought patterns. Even without that there's no guarantee that such conditioning would even be effective toward the desired ends. In short, there is currently no such thing as a "morality pill" and no particular reason to believe such a pharmaceutical could ever be developed; therefore there is no particular reason to believe this scheme would even work at all.</p>

        <p>The fact that this even made it to print makes me concerned for humanity.  This is dangerous and criminal thinking.  And there are people out there who will believe that this actually needs to happen for the good of society.  Anyone who sincerely believes that changing someone's morals compulsively is the moral thing to do, or that we should do so secretly, is the one who is actually a danger to society.  This should be criminalized.  Anyone advocating for this is essentially saying it's ok to slip roofies into someone's drink.</p>
