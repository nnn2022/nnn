    <strong>What do young people think?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m 19 and I’m over this bullshit. I’m not going to die, my family is not going to die, and because I have virtually no contact with anyone but them, my coworkers, and a few friends I’m not going to kill anyone by going about my life. In my opinion, everyone not at risk — but especially young people, like 18-30 — should be careful, wear a mask when absolutely necessary, and go about their lives. The problem is that many of the young people I see on social media or other places are still SO goddamned SCARED. Saw a post from a girl I went to high school with saying she had a panic attack because she was briefly in a crowd (with masks on). Other people were commenting and being like “omg can you imagine being stupid enough to actually hang out with people right now” and “I’m not going back to socializing without a vaccine” and “people going to restaurants literally scare me right now”, and ALL of these people are under 20. Where the risk is basically non existent. </p>
<p>Young people on this sub, I already know what you think, but what about your friends? What about the young, not at risk people you interact with? What’s the vibe there? I’m hoping that most of them are smart and decent at risk assessment, in that they are still able to live a life worth living while taking REASONABLE precautions.</p></p>

        <p>I am 23 and just finished college in software development, graduation got cancelled, can’t find a job worth for shit, me and my GF are struggling to remain afloat. Even if the lockdown and mandates ended here the after effects are still there. It’s been miserable, I just want to start working, and I don’t understand why so many people in our age group are pro lockdown, if this goes on any longer i feel like it is going to ruin our generation.</p>

        <p>You are 100% correct and I’m glad you recognize that. Everyone always says these years are the best time of your life, so do they expect young people right now to just give up those golden years? When I’m older I want to look back on my younger years and remember the fun I had and people I met, not how I spent months hiding inside from something that’s not a threat to me or my family. I sincerely hope you’re still able to enjoy being 17 and young in the face of all this insanity.</p>

        <p>I try to tell them the CDC fatality rate is 0.4% for symptomatic or 0.26% including asymptomatic meaning young people are close to zero risk. I also tell them the 6 ft rule also includes 15 minutes of interaction closer than 6 ft to be "risky". I mention more than half the deaths are nursing homes where governors sent covid patients. Basically I try to spread the facts when people bring up the topic with me, but I was getting so frustrated with these people I only do it when they specifically bring up something about covid, and only do it in passing.
Being adamant about it was just stressing me out, because not everyone is willing to listen,unfortunately.</p>

        <p>Yeah I totally get that. I’m becoming jaded at all the pushback I get whenever I try and spread real facts instead of fear. There was that one post on the skepticism sub recently by someone who decided they couldn’t take the constant fight anymore and I feel that’s a direction many of us are going towards just because it’s so goddamn HARD to be a voice of reason when everyone around you won’t listen to facts over fear. You’re doing the right thing though by spreading information and I hope you continue to do so! We need people who listen to hard facts and science like you.</p>

        <p>19 here too, sick of the constant paranoia. While what happened in Italy was tragic, what they won’t tell you on CNN is that the median age of death there was 80, something like 99% of deaths were over 50, and 96% of them had underlying conditions. Plus, they had little idea how to treat this (not their fault, they were the first hit hard) and now we know to focus more on protecting vulnerable people (nursing homes) and have better ways to help sick patients (remdesivir, steroids, not intubating too early). Given all we have learned it’s ridiculous to be restricting the movement of young healthy people, IMO</p>

        <p>My daughter is 19. SF Bay Area, lots of paranoid Karens here. She and her friends socialize pretty much normally though. One friend has to fight with or lie to her parents when she wants to go out, another was worried at the beginning because of his dad’s health, but he’s calmed down and was fine hanging out with a group of them here last week. I think some people in your age group are probably freaking out because that’s what they see their parents doing, but I haven’t seen them acting like that here. Even my almost 12 year old son rides his bike and goes to the park with friends every day, no one is staying home anymore.</p>
<p>We just found out that a friend of a friend (17) tested positive and is asymptomatic (parents had mild symptoms) and my daughter said “can I just go over there and have her cough on me?” She honestly wants to get the virus and get it over with before going back to college because she thinks it would be easier.</p>

        <p>I'm a little bit older (early 30s), and it is super split. Some are of the "you must wear a mask and hide forever or you'll kill grandma" variety, and others are "meh, we're all gonna die of something at some point, what's the point of being alive if you can't actually go out there and live to the fullest?" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So I've been hanging out with the second reasonable group as much as possible and hoping those in the first group start to realize how much time they've thrown away hiding in their homes.  It seems to be a class divide too, those with the fancy McMansions and the remote work possible jobs are in the "stay home at all costs" category, and those of us with either regular houses or apartments and who live with people who work in public-facing jobs are in the "meh category"</p>

        <p>I’m 25 and there are very mixed reactions among my friends. My husband and I are totally done with all of this. I spent years fighting anxiety and depression and succeeded in getting into my dream grad school, only to be forced into online learning, lose everything I was looking forward to in my future, and now face the worst depression of my life. There are no active cases or hospitalizations in my county and yet we’re still only halfway open and under mask and distancing mandates. It’s disgusting. </p>
<p>I have 2 best friends who have been hanging out with us from the beginning of all this and who recently took a road trip with us to a free state. It was amazing! </p>
<p>I have a couple of friends who will only hang out outdoors - we hike sometimes. They’re nervous but not insane. </p>
<p>And then I have a few other friends who seem to never want to leave their homes again. I feel very sad for them. What a miserable way to live. </p>
<p>I hope for all of our sakes that the young people who want to live full and happy lives will become more vocal and active soon. I’m doing ok while it’s summertime and I can travel and see friends who want to be normal. But when fall arrives, I don’t want to return to the safety theater hell that my university is mandating. We still have time to change public opinion before then! Good luck!</p>

        <p>My middle school age kids play with friends everyday and are having a great summer. I'm worried about fall though, you know these corona-nazis are going to ruin everything. Sports, band, choir - I hope it's not all canceled or destroyed with stupid rules. I guess there's always sledding and skating on frozen ponds, they can't police that.</p>

        <p>I’m really worried about that too. All the things that make school (and being a kid) enriching and enticing seem to be the first to go. Does no one care that we’re essentially sending our kids to prison? What about the importance of physical activity and music education and social interaction? Is that out the window in favor of risk reduction for something that’s not even a threat to kids now?</p>

        <p>This idea that the happiness of youth should be sacrificed so that old people won't die is one of the most diabolical notions ever. Shame on these evil bastards. And to think that some parents are actually going along with it - it's disgusting.</p>

        <p>They're trying to say that "singing is spreading" and all the kids are asymptomatic spreaders who are going to kill grandma. These people are monstrously evil, we've got to sing in defiance.</p>

        <p>This is starting to sound more and more Orwellian. Now it’s unsafe to do something as joyful as singing? I can understand limits on adult choirs, but middle schoolers? Come on. Music education is SO important!!!!</p>

        <p>To be fair it’s the young fucktards who went out protesting that contributed to this most recent surge in cases. I’m shocked the younger crowd is so willing to give up potential years of their lives for this. I would have been pissed with this happening during college. Imagine losing some great years of your life and then entering a shitty job market right when you graduate? LOL</p>

        <p>I'm 24. My friends are 23-27. We're all fairly reasonable about it. We wear masks indoors as required, but not outside and we do hug. I'm thinking of throwing a small party (less than 10 people, I don't really have a lot of friends) as I'm moving soon anyway. </p>
<p>I had my first real date since January and it was bizarre. He wore a mask the entire time, I did too to make him feel comfortable, although I took it off to eat and have a few short airing out my face breaks. I walked 5 miles in 92 degree weather for this person. He called me the next day saying that we should be friends, so I'm really glad I got to suffer for that /s. Now I'm paranoid that he's going to get corona from this and somehow cause problems for me.</p>

        <p>Dating is super weird right now. I’m just starting to see a girl I met recently and thank god she seems to be over it just as much as me in terms of masks and distancing and shit. It shouldn’t be lucky right now to find someone who actually treats you like a person and not a disease vector. I’m sorry that didn’t work out but I’m glad you’re able to see friends! Have fun with the party, that sounds like a fantastic idea!</p>

        <p>Yeah, my hopes aren't up. The people I see on the sites are unbelievably strange. I can't believe the things people write on their profiles or the pictures they post. It's a public forum!! Anyone can see it!!</p>
<p>I'm now up to 5 exes/people who have said we should "be friends" on my Facebook, which feels like a sad milestone.</p>
