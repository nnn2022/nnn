    <strong>Am I crazy for thinking the Covid vaxxers are going to die?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep running scenarios in my head, but I keep thinking the Covid vaxxers are going to die. I watched the Dr. TenPenny video but I was thinking this before hand once I learned about mRNA vaccines. I know as a person into conspiracy they were talking about depopulation schemes 20 years ago on the behalf of Bill Gates and others, but the worries I have go even beyond that. </p>
<p>I had strange dreams too more than a year ago. Just bad ominous feelings. I hope I am wrong. [I was known as having high discernment when a fundie Christian and friends see me as "intuitive"]. I hope I am damn mistaken with these thoughts but it keeps plaguing me. I have bad thoughts about all these Covid vaxx friends being dead people walking. :( </p>
<p>So what's going to happen if the worse does happen and people die.</p>
<p>Don't people realize they will just go "whoops our bad"? Some of us disabled people who have had crazy medical stuff happen, know how that all pans out. My friend with terminal cancer, had a cold and unfeeling doctor dish out her recent news. It's called "Tough Luck kid, the dial spun wrong". </p>
<p>I am sure they will tell them their sacrifice was "worth it" if it does happen as they lay on their dead beds, for the behalf of nation and "science".</p>
<p>Sorry for such dark thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>I've been having my mom watch Dr Tenpenny and she was like "I want her as my doctor". </p>
<p>There's too many people getting these "vaccines" AKA experimental gene therapies thinking they are in the clear because they didn't suffer a severe reaction or die immediately. It doesn't work like that (most of the time). </p>
<p>Another thing to consider is how much ADDITIONAL damage is going to occur when the CDC decides next year that we all need either a different vaccine, or another round of the same one. Cause it's not gonna end with just one set.</p>

        <p>I liked Tenpenny. Yeah I know she is called a conspiracy nut webwide, I may not even agree with her on everything but reading pharm websites etc, about mRNA, she didn't state anything that wasn't true and her conclusions and theories about what may happen ring true.  I think it is sad how many who think they survived the first days think all the problems are over.   Yeah they have talked about boosters and all the rest.</p>

        <p>Nothing crazy about this at all, consider what happened last year, lockdowns for a virus that aren't even more deadly than the common flu, silencing of doctors who talk about the importance of boosting your immune system, and in some cases even outright banning stuff that helps boost immune system.</p>
<p>They've clearly gotten the vast majority used to a clinical clean environment with masks and hand sanitizer, people are scared AF, spend most of their time at home and disinfect everything, which means killing of all the bacteria, even the good ones your body needs for a good immune system.</p>
<p>Then we have a lack of information, despite all the fearmongering in MSM, and mask mandates nobody talks about how to use the mask properly and what type of mask to use, some people cover only their mouth but not the nose or vice versa, people bathing with their masks, mouth holes in masks etc etc... None of that makes any sense.</p>
<p>So what happens with the vaccine then? Well I don't think people will die immediately, but they will likely damage immune system over time. Why you might ask, well if peoples immune system are failing they get more prone to get sick, which means more money for big pharma. And governments gain from it because people who are prone to get sick stays at home and won't be outside protesting the new normal.</p>
<p>I think the plan here is to weaken immune system over time, for the world government to gain more control and for big pharma to increase their profits from selling "treatments". Meanwhile, lot's of people will try to get back to normal and die from common diseases, they'll refuse the vaccine involvement as long as possible. So there won't be mass deaths, but a severe increase in deaths. I.e controlled depopulation.</p>
<p>And how will depopulation affect the world today? probably not very much since most human labor is replaced by robots anyway. They won't need many people anymore, and people without jobs tend to cause trouble. Just look at any ghetto, it's not a sustainable society with that many unemployed people in one place.</p>

<p>This. Although there has definitely been cased where the vaccine has killed a few people (most likely Hank Aaron), it seems that for the most part people have just having severe side effects instead of quick death.</p>
<p>The goal is to weaken your immune system, and then make you want to stay inside and accept a "new normal" instead of trying to return to normal life, because you're getting more sick even from stuff like a common cold than you ever have in your entire life. Slowly over time this will lead to an increase overall globally in the amount of people dying per year as everyone's immune system is a crippled mess that can't handle anything.</p>
<p>They're thinking here, they know they can't screw up and have the whole world see people dying right after the vaccine, otherwise there will be mass resistance.</p>

        <p>Exactly, and despite all talk about mandatory vaccination that probably won't happen. For us resisting the new normal it's more risky to get beaten up by a herd of sheep or simply get denied essential services (even those we pay for) because we haven't vaccinated. Many people will sadly give up and take the shot anyway because they want the little part of social life back, that they can get. Or to avoid getting beaten up.</p>
<p>Some people will die immediately, or get severe side effect's that's normal for traditional vaccines, but shouldn't happen with mRNA. They clearly haven't created something that works 100% according to their plans, but with coverups they reach their goals anyway.</p>
<p>They know that some people will resist, and we know that. Question is what will happen to us, I think that we might be kicked out of society basically, if we wanna survive we have to build our own parallel society far away from the mega cities and completely self sustainable. Many people won't be strong enough to do that. </p>
<p>It's also very likely that they'll come after us trying to recruit us. Playing nice and licking butt, offering us a high position in the new normal, all a charade of course and those who accept the offer might live a wealthy life but will be overthrown with work to stay distracted from reality. Kind of like the middle class today who has massive loans and a crap job they can't quit from because then they wouldn't afford to pay their interest.</p>

        <p>If I was healthy, and younger, I would already be leaving to a remote area or intentional community or third world country where people can survive off the modern grid.  Most people don't have the skills to survive in going off the grid either, and sadly I am one of them. I need modern medicine to survive.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think slow-kill may be the chosen path too because a huge die-off would wake people up unless they plan to cover that as Covid21 killing everyone. Sick and despondent people aren't going to be able to fight totalitarianism and the crack down in control they have planned. I believe regular colds and flus will kill the people who have their immune systems busy making "spike proteins". No one ever talked about turning that shit off or how it is supposed to be.</p>

        <p>I agree it could be a slower "increase in deaths" where people die of autoimmune disease and damaged immune systems. It may not be a complete fast die-off.  I think they want control over sick people too, there's going to be a lot more disabled people too, and yes they can sell "treatments". A sick population is an easily controlled population. One part of their depopulation plans is they don't need common workers anymore, automation was a big part of the picture, they have robots and there simply is not enough work for everyone. Too bad we have evil elites who only want power and money. With this level of technology, and if humans could apply themselves to creative and other pursuits, free of the pressure to "make a living" or an adjunct to that, we could have a Renaissance of sorts, but what do we get hell dystopia.</p>

        <p>It already has killed some, it wont kill them all it will make some infertile but even then it wont make them all infertile that would just be to obvious and even the sheep would wake up, this is just one step of many toward their goal of depopulation, one arrow in their quiver sorta speak, and its not even the first one they have released birth rates are already at a dangerous level.</p>

        <p>I agree the goal could be to make people infertile. The scary stuff coming out about miscarriages and periods points to something. I do think birth rates NOW have to be falling like crazy due to Covid, just knowing how screwed up society is and unstable even if you don't buy into the narrative.</p>

        <p>who can afford children anymore. I think probably the only babies happening now are with religious people like the Quiverful and Amish, and 'accident' babies where the birth control failed or teen pregnancies. Anyone choosing to have a child in this clusterfuck, unless they are independently wealthy and can protect their family from the worse, has to be insane.</p>

        <p>People are dying from it. But Dr Tenpenny predicts that the real destruction will happen 3 months to 20 years after vaccination. By that time, there will be enough plausible deniability that the vaccine won't be blamed unfortunately. Even right now, they are trying to blame covid for the people who drop dead immediately after being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Yes people are dying from it now or early on. Sure with the deaths to come that many months later, as life spans drop, they can cook those numbers and hide how many people are dying especially since some may last a few years and maybe some a little longer. They also have the gambit of blaming new Covid "variants". We are so fucked.</p>

        <p>It'll kill off elderly and vulnerable (there's chart already from biggest covid vaccine testing ground in world aka Israel where you can see in comparison to European countries, they suffered excess death from beginning of this year and it's in the elderly bracket the most), anything can be tipping point for those with deteriorated or fragile health, as we learned with covid narrative.  It'll caught up onto some young people like it already did, but it'll probably fuck up their immune system &amp; be prone to sickness, unable to conceive and develop autoimmune diseases.  My prognosis - we have whole year to go, where I'm positive a lot of things will unravel - the more years pass, everything will be crystal clear. And they'll definitely run in meantime sacrificing for greater good program. Do you know what they do to people in cult? They can convince to go thru miles of abuse to the point of suicide (reminded me now the single vaccinated person I personally know in my small town - her son was literally in such cult &amp; ended up with exact fate). And what do you see? People are convinced to being prisoners of their own home, cut off contact with families and friends and already in training process with cutting of their oxygen supply for 'greater good', now vaccine makes them sicker than covid did, sicker than any other vaccine they took in childhood &amp; they cheer IT WAS ALL WORTH IT. Do the math... We should introduce new term for next phase of doomers, maskholes and pro-lockdowners... Medical kamikazes.</p>

        <p>It is all a cult. Operates just like it. People have allowed their lives to be destroyed. Even those of us questioning things are isolated if no one else is around in our lives [I have online friends only who do] Even the more affluent Republicans in my area are lining up for the shot around here. I do think it will take out the most vulnerable but then they can blame Covid and obesity, Covid and old age, etc etc etc. I think the young will be made infertile and autoimmune disease will skyrocket.  I find myself thinking if it goes really bad and a lot start dying maybe it will wake people up but then they'd probably just crow Covid 21!!!!!!! They know how to move people down abuse highway and ruin with propaganda and brainwashing, it's like abuse victims, doing what they are told worrying about threats or being hit from their abusers. Societal Stockholm syndrome. People throwing their lives away from the Covid cult, like that UFO cult where they all drank poisonous Kool-Aid. It's like the entire society has gone Jim Jones.  Yeah the vaccine makes people sicker, and no one is thinking it out. They almost seem proud of their sickness because they were "obedient".</p>

        <p>I don’t think that these thoughts are unnecessarily dark, but it’s also very likely that the odds of surviving the vaccine are very high, so people who die of it would likely be of the same groups who would die of Covid. </p>
<p>What’s scarier is the thought of long-term health effects and chronic autoimmune diseases, which will likely affect a lot more people, even those without vulnerabilities. But again, I would say that we should try to be hopeful- if 1% of people are affected in these severe ways, it’s a tragedy, but tragedy happens every day and it’s likely most people will be able to survive it without those effects. </p>
<p>Not saying you or anyone should get the vaccine- but just not to get too depressed.</p>
