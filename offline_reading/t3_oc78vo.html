        <p>Ok so a few things here.</p>
<p>1 is that mRNA vaccines don't change your genome. They don't even enter the nucleus or go anywhere near your DNA. The Astrazeneca vaccine does actually use gene editing though. I'm not sure why people are so hung up on mRNA saying it does something it doesn't do, when the other vaccine opening admits it does.</p>
<p>2 is that, even if this were true, you would not automatically become patented. I think this person is arguing that you would immediately become patentable, which is different. Someone would have to apply and be approved to patent you. Once they did own the patent they wouldn't actually own you as a person but rather would own the right to use the exact make up of DNA. Also only a handful of cells in your arm would qualify as they would be the only ones with altered DNA.</p>
<p>3 is that even if you have gone through any kind of gene therapy you are still biologically, legally and ethically 100% organic and human. Gene therapy had been used for decades and no one who has gone through it has been denied human rights based on not being fully human. The changes are so small they do not qualify as transhuman.</p>

<li>It would be more than just a few cells in your arm as the vaccine verifiably does not stay in your arm but travels systemically. That being said the affected cells would be destroyed by your own immune system, assuming your immune system is responding in a healthy manner.</li>

        <p>Thank you but oof, that's a bit much for me!</p>
<p>Also it seems to be about mRNA but I was specifically talking about Astrazeneca. My understanding was that the cells have their genes edited are only local, but that the protein produced by them would move throughout the body (same as with proteins produced by mRNA vaccines) and then are destroyed?</p>
<p>Is that study claiming that cells with altered DNA multiply throughout the body?</p>

        <p>Yeah this one is specific to mRNA instead of adenovirus like astrazeneca. Those tables shows mainly where the injection contents of the vaccine go to, it basically shows that they do not remain in the injection site and will cause more of a systematic scenario. </p>
<p>Also no this study does not claim that any DNA is altered,  also mRNA in itself shouldn't do that. mRNA is just a messenger RNA component which instructs cells to produce proteins, spike proteins in this case, it does not directly alter DNA since it lacks reverse transcriptases, and supposedly it doesn't either have a viral vector that provides that aspect (HIV for instance does this). It's another story if it actually has a viral vector they didn't tell us about, but that's more conspiracy level so probably not?</p>
<p>The thing more this study showcases is that, this injection will not remain locally in the injection site at all, only 17% remained. It was sort of a reference to bolster his claim that "the vaccine verifiably does not stay in your arm but travels systemically".</p>

        <p>That's correct the mRNA vaccines are transcribed by ribosome they do not enter the nucleus of the cell or alter DNA. But my understanding is that the Astrazeneca vaccine does (not that this is an issue), or at least does in laymen's terms. </p>
<p>Rather than delivering mRNA it delivers DNA which must then enter the nucleus of our cells. My understanding is that it does not integrate with our pre existing DNA but just hangs out there in the nucleus along with it - but I'm not super sure on that point. Either way those cells end up with DNA in them that isn't our own. That DNA then is copied into mRNA and transcribed by the rhibosomes to produce the protein.</p>
<p>Based on what you have said above it seems that the adenovirus can move through the body and insert the DNA into cells beyond the arm, however given that its non replicating I assume it couldn't go very far, and certainly wouldn't effect all cells systemically.</p>

        <p>Yeah not really an expert on adenoviruses but from what I've read. Adenoviruses are basically just viral vectors with a bit different characteristics like for instance the lack of replication, you also have other ones like retroviruses and lentiviruses. Then it is also claimed that supposedly adenoviruses do not integrate into the genome, but these are mostly in vitro studies, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2937808/ this for instance suggests that it is possible in vivo. So it perhaps isn't that far fetched to fear monger over it. Depends entirely if we can trust the companies who produce these things, and considering their track records, it's perhaps not the best bet.</p>
<p>And yeah I am not sure if adenovirus versions have the same leakage issue, that one is specific to mRNA. Possibly but who knows.</p>

        <p>As always, don't take anything to be cold hard fact at face vue just because it looks legit, I'm just giving my reason for making this statement. </p>
<p>Here is a leaked study done by Pfizer that shows that the lipid nanoparticles in the vaccine that serve as the vector for the mRNA do not stay in the arm. This link to the entire article is a PDF posted by The Last American Vagabond, but you can find one page screenshots posted on Twitter by a few doctors who are questioning the COVID narrative. Dr Ah Kahn Sayed posted a screenshot on his Twitter account back on May 29th, not sure if Twitter removed it or not. Dr Peter McCullough gained access to this study and he sent it to investigative journalist Whitney Webb, and she in turn forwarded it to Ryan at The Last American Vagabond. Relevant information is in the table on pages 16 and 17.</p>

<p>Also, here is the link to the page at The Last American Vagabond where he discusses this study and how he acquired the entire file, beginning at the 14 minute mark of the video. </p>

        <p>&rt;1 is that mRNA vaccines don't change your genome. They don't even enter the nucleus or go anywhere near your DNA. The Astrazeneca vaccine does actually use gene editing though. I'm not sure why people are so hung up on mRNA saying it does something it doesn't do, when the other vaccine opening admits it does.</p>
<p>The fact that BigPharma doesn't want to open-source their secrete sauces only means that you are taking their word for it that they are, in fact, using mRNA and not something else.</p>
