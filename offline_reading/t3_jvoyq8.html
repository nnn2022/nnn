    <strong>A COVID Wedding... but a relieving ending</strong>
    <p><p>So over the weekend I went to a wedding. I’m in Australia so our ‘rules’ are not as harsh as some other places, even though we shut down states for 17 cases (literally happened yesterday). We currently have 0 cases of community transmission in my state (I think) which makes these rules even more ridiculous. During the entire experience I was just thinking this sub is the only place that would get the ridiculousness of it. </p>
<p>Let me just tell you, I was ASTOUNDED when the MC started railing off all the various rules for the wedding. Rules included no more than 20 people on the dance floor at once, and ONLY people in the wedding party. No mingling between tables. You were told to sit in your seat and ‘dance’ in your seat only (um what?) and not get up and co-mingle with others who aren’t on your table. </p>
<p>It gets better, between EACH FREAKING SPEECH the MC sanitised the microphone and made the person who is doing the speech, sanitise their hands. After every, single, speech. There were about 6. At this point I was like, what the heck are we even going to do at this wedding? It’ll be more like a show. Well... </p>
<p>As the night went on, the rules went completely out the window. People were mingling all over the place, I shook like 3 people’s hands which was great (even coming from me, a germaphobe) because I knew what it meant. The dance floor also must’ve had like 30+ people on it at one point, and not just from the main party but even guests! </p>
<p>Turns out the rules were enforced by the venue, but the people running the wedding didn’t care for the rules. We even had a group pic on the dance floor with the entire wedding’s guests (like 75 people) with the event doors shut to prevent getting in trouble. We were also told not to upload any photos of crowds for the same reason. </p>
<p>Even though I was super concerned at the beginning, I was so glad to see how many purely truly did not give a crap about the ridiculous rules. Maybe we will see more people waking up to reality in near future, here’s hoping!</p></p>
