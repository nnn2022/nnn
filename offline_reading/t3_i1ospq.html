    <strong>Norman Mailer on Fascism</strong>
    <p><p>The podcast 99 Percent Invisible, which has been very pro lockdown, recently did <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/valley-of-the-fallen/">an episode</a> on Francisco Franco. Although this episode really didn't mention the lockdowns, it included a quote from Norman Mailer which reminded me of our current situation:</p>
<p>&rt;Fascism goes back. To our infancy and our childhood, where we were always told how to live. We were told do this, donâ€™t do that. No. No. Yes, you may do that. No, you may not do that.</p>
<p>I don't think he would have liked Andrew Cuomo very much (or a number of other governors).</p></p>
