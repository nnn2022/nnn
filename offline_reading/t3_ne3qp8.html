    <strong>Even when all the lockdown stuff is done we still have to live with the damage done to the economy.</strong>
    <p><p>In the US they spent trillions on the pandemic. Most of the dollars ever minted were made since the pandemic. Massive inflation is here. Just look at the cost of average goods going up. </p>
<p>They forced business closures and put a large portion of the workforce on unemployment. There was massive fallout there. They gave pandemic protection loans. They gave out  thousands to each family several times. All of this hurts the economy. </p>
<p>Paying for all the "free" testing and vaccines all comes out of taxpayer funds. </p>
<p>Not to mention all the waste fraud and abuse of funds. Apparently part of the US covid response is to fund gender studies in Pakistan.</p></p>

        <p>The mental trauma that’s been done to the average person will never be fully understood. The fear, confusion, tribalism, desperation, hopelessness... I’m one of the lucky ones but I’m seeing first hand the steady degradation and demoralization of the people around me. Life use to appear as cyclical for most people, back and forth, left and right, tide in tide out... but I think the realization that the cyclical cycle has turned into a whirlpool and wherever you are on the descent towards the drain, it’s not looking good.</p>
