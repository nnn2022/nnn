    <strong>When will the world stop being fucked?</strong>
    <p><p>The world has always been a little fucked but this is some next level shit. And from where I'm sitting it seems like things are getting worse not better. I live in NH, the Live Free or Die state...... And we have mask mandates. Went to a restaurant with my extended family the other week... We left from the same house.... Had to sit at two separate tables, wear masks in the ten feet from the door to the table then take them off. Not allowed to stand up without covering our filthy faces.... Just what the actual fuck is happening. It's gone on so long and I've mostly just stayed home because I hate walking around and seeing all this absolute bullshit everywhere. Honestly, if people were sick? Sure. But people are healthy... I looked up the actual number, when my town passed a mask mandate? There were 11 active cases. In. The. County!! Not the town. I'm trying to look ahead to a time when I can go to a restaurant with my family or stay in a hotel and not feel like a prisoner anymore. When do you guys think that'll be?? Or do you think we all just need to go start our own lives in the fucking woods.</p></p>
