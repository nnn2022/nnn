    <strong>I just wanna cry today</strong>
    <p><p>I'm fed up. Since saturday, a curfew is in place in my country. All that politicians and the media are talking about is vaccinations.</p>
<p>Everything looks like vaccinated people might enjoy the summer a little bit. And after that? I'm guessing the Indian variant will be the next big scare in europe. People will have to get revaccinated, but we probably cannot be sure that the vaccines work fully against that new strain, so that means another lockdown.</p>
<p>This is psychological warfare until almost everyone will get that fucking shot. I won't. But I know I won't ever have a normal life again. </p>
<p>Right now, I have a good job, but a crucial part of my job is keeping up with the news so I can't just shut it out. And who knows when they will require me to be vaccinated to keep working there.</p>
<p>Worst of all is this deep divide in society. People are living in two different realities. I can't think of any way to ever fully unite a society this divided. </p>
<p>Our future is as uncertain as can be. Whatever plans those in power have for us, they will not stop fucking us over. I'm scared to see what comes next. And I'm scared to see that the majority of people will go along with it. I'll be the one everyone roles their eyes over, the psychotic conspiracy theorist.</p>
<p>I'm sick and tired! Just needed to vent a bit. Keep up the good work, NNN!</p>
<p>Edit: I just got banned from r/offmychest for posting here. Not that I'd miss that sub but... Insanity reaches a new peak every day, it feels like.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly the only answer or recourse you have is to peacefully refuse the orders. Go about your life as normally as you are able. Let people see you smiling, happy because you're not afraid. Hold doors for people who look afraid if you're maskless.</p>

        <p>If you‚Äôll allow me a white pill, these extreme measures always have a counter reaction. You can‚Äôt shove the pendulum in one direction and think it‚Äôs not going to swing back. It will take a little time, but the backlash is coming and it‚Äôs going to be huge. In the meantime just work on your own well-being. Make sure you have some rest and positive reflection in your life. Hobbies are great, anything that pulls you away from the void. Don‚Äôt lose hope. We shape our reality in many meaningful ways, look for where you can make the most difference for yourself and your family. It will help you ride out the storm. ‚úåÔ∏è</p>

        <p>I live here too and it's miserable. I feel nothing but fear, loneliness and despair. More than anything, I wish I was back in the 1990's. I don't belong here with those people who seem okay with spending the rest of their lives imprisoned in a police state, never receiving freedom from those suffocating, dehumanizing masks, and being injected with one experimental "vaccine" after the other. I feel like I'm never going to have the loving husband and baby daughter I'm longing for. I'm never going to feel happy or laugh or feel like a human being ever again üò¢üíî </p>
<p>While America is resuming life, we're headed towards a late spring\summer with significantly <strong>more</strong> authoritarian restrictions and fear mongering than last year. It's horrible. I wish we had Ron DeSantis here to save us from this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Gotta settle down man find a hobby you love. The stress is a slow burn for a while Ive been in my bed fetal position no food only water for days brainstorming a solve for some of the biggest most sickening problems in my life.  And when I cracked the code I jumped and I stumped so hard the room couldnt hold me A overwhelming feeling of strength and genius and an electric buzz on the  back of my brain. In short if you continue to live and grow hopefully someday you can laugh at your former self because he was expletive expletive </p>
<p>TLDR: They tried this many times before over the few thousand years. They either partially succeed for a bit and get killed and taken over by a new government. Or just fail before it can even take off. Whos "they" thats complicated in short billionaires.</p>

<p>Joseph Jordan, an alien researcher of MUFON stumbled upon a recurrent theme among alien abductees, the victims were claiming that they could stop their alien abductions midway through by simply saying the name of Jesus.

        <p>there is some underlying political structure what is built into our regional and nation states constitutions, the very basic contract how we agree to function as a society</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and this underlying political structure is ... sad as it is ... of a hierarchical structure</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what originates in the nearly 2000 years we suffered from empires imposing themselves onto the local communities all over europe plus extending their reach via 500 years of most brutal colonisation</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>today our nation state replaces the king/queen ... while the regional state acts like the feudal families the king/queen chooses to be its executing servant to finally dominate the local community, the village, the town, the city-district into submission  </p>
<p>today we are able to elect the few hundred people as our representatives into the national and regional states parliamentary assemblies where they would make the laws ... removed from any connection to what the people living in local communities really would want  </p>
<p>"divide et impera" "divide to rule"  </p>
<p>is the principle what is in action since about 2000 years ... and we never really got down to it getting rid of it  </p>
<p>why on earth do we think we would need to elect people who make the laws for us in the national and the regional states parliamentary assemblies ?  </p>
<p>what is wrong with us ... the people living as each others neighbours ... creating, maintaining and interpreting the law, making the very rules with and for each other ... rules what we fully agree with and are willing to follow</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but ... how could we possibly shift the political decision powers away from the nation state and regional state towards the local community ? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how to fully dissolve the political hierarchy what has shown again and again to be most vulnerable to big money corrupting both the national and regional state representatives ...  </p>
<p>I see a most gentle and elegant path in renewing the very constitutions of the regional and nation states, possibly using concepts such as :</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community is its own sovereign. it inherits all political powers from the regional/provincial/cantonal state and from the nation state.</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes its own law. rules what the inhabitants of this local sovereign community create with and for each other. the local law replaces all laws previously made on regional/provincial/cantonal state level and nation state level.</p>
<p>all sovereign local communities receive a share of all properties from the regional/provincial/cantonal state as well as from the nation state, proportional to the numbers of inhabitants.</p>
<p>every local sovereign community is able to exit/quit/leave<br>
at all times<br>
without conditions<br>
the regional/provincial/cantonal state<br>
and the nation state</p>

        <p>the majority of today living human beings are descendants of the victims from both the european feudal families and the churches what too were orchestrating and being the main driving force for the colonial occupation of the other continents ...</p>
<p>those descendants of victims of european feudalism and colonialism  are today dependant to find a job and ask  a person if it would be possible to rent an appartement ...</p>
<p>most human beings have been made dependant on offering their servitude to their fellow human beings</p>
<p>all kinds of twisting behaviour comes from this being cornered into servitude ... from being blocked acess to the planet earth its natural ressources ...</p>
<p>like a child what has been abducted away from its mother</p>
<p>so is the human being who is blocked from acess the abundance of mother earth</p>
<p>therefore i believe it to be a most important task to help the human species understand how beneficial how healing the direct acess to mother earth is for everyone</p>
<p>like ... even if one does not want to build ones own house and does not like to grow ones own vegetables but prefers doing some nice work one eventually chooses to do in ones own settings, chooses with whom one want to work with, to whom one sells ones products and one finds some decent people who allow to rent an appartement ...</p>
<p>it would still be good for that person to know in the back of its head ... whenever i get sick and tired of being in this human society ... i can choose to retire onto this 500 square meters of land what the local sovereign community is reserving in my name ... whenever i want to i can choose to stop working for others, stop producing stuff to sell to others and start growing my own vegetables after i have built my own house from clay and straw or hempstalks</p>
<p>and all the time i am not using these 500 square meters of fertile land reserved onto my name since the time of my birth </p>
<p>the full assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings what create and maintain the local law of this local sovereign community ... the village, the town, the city-district  i am born into ... has reserved this 500 square meters of fertile land in my name at the time of my birth and it will stay in my name as long as i live ....</p>
<p>the local sovereign community, the village, the town, the city district ... what governs itselfs, what accepts no dominance of any regional or nation state</p>
<p>all the time the lands in communal guardianship would not be used by individuals for self-sustaining ... these communal lands could be used to generate public wealth what again could be used then to distribute some basic income without conditions to anyone who neither would be able or willing to grow its own food and build its own house nor be able or willing to earn enough money to pay for a rented appartement via  a decent work arrangement</p>
<p>and this freedom is it ... what is missing .. this freedom to choose wether one would want to do this or that within the human society, contribute to the cycle of services and products going round or rather choose to be on ones own </p>
<p>wether one wants to produce anything or just prefers to reflect on what is happening inside oneself and all around oneself</p>
<p>this freedom what would allow then to prepare a life setting where one could start researching the passage towards evolving into the next level of human existance</p>
<p>i believe in this passage... i guess its one of joy and love and sweet soft smooth and gentle feelings, perhaps some time rough too but allways in a playfull way, never too serious never too earnest, allways light and relaxed, in the flow </p>
<p>not mental dominance</p>
<p>but mind soul and body flowing together to the tune of dance what brings all who are here and now together in a celebration of life</p>

        <p>one way to approach this passage towards the next level of human evolution was for me to draw and write </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.org/details/drawingstudies">http://archive.org/details/drawingstudies</a></p>
<p>i believe that it is possible and very interesting for a human being to dissolve not only all hierarchies but also dissolve the borders between the human animal and plant existance</p>
<p>to become what one desires</p>
<p>to be what and who one is lusting for</p>
<p>i understand that </p>
<p>every desire, every ... i want this ... i want to consume this ...</p>
<p>i want to touch this, smell it, lick it ..</p>
<p>is a search for reconnection to the source</p>
<p>one searches for completion of ones virome and biome ...</p>
<p>the human being wants to connect with fellow human beings and animals and plants with the intention to become complete</p>
<p>whole</p>
<p>20 years ago i  wrote ...</p>
<p>alles ist eins zu denken + in ruhe zu fuehlen + alle wesen lieben zu wollen = frieden</p>
<p>all is one thinking + calm feeling + wanting to love all beings = peace</p>
<p>today i still believe that organic food is important not only for the individual human being to nourish its own body in a high quality manner but it is also as a responsible way to not pollute the planet earth with pesticides and synthetic fertilizers</p>
<p>wanting to love all beings ... i find myself these days thinking about how important and beneficial it could be for the human being if it would honor the coronavirus, if it would accept it and not fight it</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>how could we help the single individual human being to get into direct connection with mother earth ... </p>
<p>so this human being can exercise itself in satisfying its hunger for information ... scents, tastes, visual stumuli, movements, touches...</p>
<p>in a manner what is not dependant onto the fellow human being but has access to all the variety of human animal and plant existance ...</p>
<p>what could help here is the equal acess to the very planet earth for every human being</p>
<p>every human being could receive 500 square meters of fertile soil at the very beginning of its life ... as soon as it understands language or even before ... its mother and father and anyone else knowing it could tell it ...</p>
<p>" here is a space of land what we have reserved for you ... here you will be able to build your hut/house from clay and straw/hempstalks ... will be able to grow your own vegetable and fruits ... here you will be able to live a life what you decide when you want to think, feel and do what with whom or alone </p>
<p>as long as you live you will have access to this land and you never have to pay any taxes for it or do anything in return of the local sovereign community leasing this land to you"</p>
<p>how to finance such a communal land ... how to motivate the farmers who own most of the land in switzerland today ... to sell it towards the local communitities ... the more than 2000 einwohnergemeinden which for example could use the finances they would inherit from the cantonal regional states ... the 55 percent of the swiss national bank owned by the 26 cantons what together build the swiss confederation, the swiss nation state ... these 55 percent are worth about 300 billion swiss francs ...</p>
<p>all land what is used in switzerland for agriculture today has an approximate market worth of about 100 bilion swiss francs</p>
<p>it would be possible today for the people who are eglible to vote in these cantons to demand a vote ... via  a cantonal people initiative ... wether or not these national bank shares should be used to bring back the land from the private farmers into the guardianship of the more than 2000 einwohnergemeinden ... the local communities</p>
<p>so they then could distribute the land equally to all of the 8.4 million human beings who live here in switzerland today</p>
<p>so no one ever would need to be subservient any more to an employer or a person who allows others to rent appartements</p>
<p>like ...</p>
<p>everyone would receive a piece of land to build ones own house on it and grow ones own food</p>
<p>simple</p>

        <p>but ...</p>
<p>recently i have found an even better possibility how to get there</p>
<p>like ...</p>
<p>how to empower the local community so it can be its own sovereign ... so its no more dependant from the regional/provincial/cantonal state and also is not dependant from the nation state:</p>
<p>the renewal of the states constitutions</p>
<p>to fully decentralize all political powers</p>
<p>to dissolve most all hierarchies:</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>every local community, every village/town/city-district ... is its own sovereign. it inherits all political powers both from the regional/provincial/cantonal state it is associated with as well as</p>
<p>from the the nation state.</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes its own law. rules what are valid within the borders of this local community. this local law replaces all laws made previously on the regional/provincial/cantonal state level as well as on the nation state level.</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities inherit a share of all properties of both the regional/provincial/cantonal state it is associated with as well as of the nation state, proportional to the numbers of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>every local sovereign community is able to quit/exit/leave both</p>
<p>the regional/provincial/cantonal state as well as the nation state</p>
<p>at all times</p>
<p>without conditions.</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>after the constitutions of both the regional states as well as the nation states would be changed in such a way ...</p>
<p>there might be a big enough chance for the people who love freedom and want to trust into their fellow human beings to live together in a respectfull dignified way</p>
<p>for example that one local sovereign community ... a village, a town, a city-district ...</p>
<p>might want to go the full way to dissolve all hierarchies ... not only dissolve the powers of regional and nation states but also dissolve the powers of all councils  and institutions who represent others... like ...</p>
<p>replace the executive council, the legislative assembly, the courts, the police, the military ...</p>
<p>with the full assembly of all human beings who live here and now together as neighbours</p>
<p>every child, youth and adult human being is invited to participate with exact the same voting power to find a sollution for this question what is occupying the minds of all or many who live in this local sovereign community</p>
<p>to create the local law</p>
<p>like ... for example ... a far develloped local community of wise and compassionate human beings ... would for example choose to keep the local law as minimal as possible ... like ...</p>
<p>no rules are best rules</p>
<p>and instead focus the mental and emotional energies towards the wanting to support each other, think the best of each other, trust each other that everyone would want to help each other find satisfaction, find what one needs to satisfy ones hunger, ones desire to reconnect to the source of life and existance</p>
<p>a very minimal local law then might look like:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>we who live here together want to honor the </p>
<p>mutual consented agreements between individual human beings</p>
<p>without violence we seek to cultivate an understanding</p>
<p>of each others needs and wishes</p>
<p>if two or more fellow human beings do not find an understanding</p>
<p>how to solve a difficult situation , disagree on how to go forward</p>
<p>everyone is able to call at all times the full assembly of all human beings living here and now in this local sovereign community</p>
<p>the full assembly of all inhabitants will try to come to a just and fair decision what is the law here and now</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>seen from my point of view ...</p>
<p>its important to free the human being from being tied to its fellow human being ... this dependance towards employers or clients or people who allow others to rent appartements ...</p>
<p>does not help at all to cultivate a strong psyche, a feeling environment where one is able to connect to fellow beings in an open and uncomplicated way ... it also enslaves the body as one is caught in these cycles of having to go to work, performing bodily movements one does not want to do but needs to do to earn money to pay the rent for the appartement ....</p>
<p>but as important it is to free the individual personal human being from being encaged in these frames of employment and rented appartement ... lifestyles ...</p>
<p>its also important how to get there</p>
<p>how to repair thousands of years of enslavement</p>
<p>not only have the european feudal bunch of thieves tortured all other continents with their colonial expansion drives but before that the very european people who emigrated into the newly occupied colonies were destabilised during centuries at home ... their forefathers allready being enslaved and their lands taken away from a few families who gripped everyone else very tightly</p>
<p>so ... how to get towards this moment ...</p>
<p>when one stands on some land what the community has given to one for a whole lifetime to use as one wishes, provided one does not pollute the soil, the water, the air ...</p>
<p>it could also be possible to imagine that the very people who sit today on massive amounts of land and money ... the ones who have inherited these riches from their forefathers what stole these riches from others both in europe and in the colonies ...</p>
<p>that these rich people would choose </p>
<p>to share some part of their private wealth</p>
<p>voluntarily</p>
<p>for example a person who owns three appartement houses in the city could give one or two of them towards the local sovereign community ... the person who inherited a family fortune built upon exploitation of fellow european and people of other continents during centuries of european feudalism and its colonial expansions ...</p>
<p>such a whealty person by inheritance ....</p>
<p>could trust these properties into the hands of the full assembly of all human beings who live here and now</p>
<p>so they again ... all children, youth and adults who live here and now ... all inhabitants living here voting with the very same decision power what would happen with such voluntary reparations, donations what came towards the community motivated by individuals wishes to clean up their family history</p>
<p>possible to think also of such a voluntary reparations movement to help with bringing the land used for agriculture into the stewardship of the local community ... </p>
<p>i have recently calculated that the land what is used in western europe for agriculture would be sufficient to give half of it back to wildlife ... to animals roaming free, trees not being killed ... </p>
<p>and even after half of all agricultural lands in western europe would be given back to nature for the mother earth to heal ... for her to enjoy her animal and tree children being free from human domination ...</p>
<p>there still would be enough space for the 80 million human beings who are today seeking refuge, who were forced to leave their home regions because of wars and economic hardship ...</p>
<p>to invite them to come to europe as a part of a reparation concept</p>
<p>to pay it forward</p>
<p>use the wealth amassed in western europe trough colonial times to buy the agriculturally used land so the approximatly 450 million people living in europe would be able to invite these 80 million refugees </p>
<p>to each enjoy a 500 square meter space of fertile land to build a house on it and grow ones own vegan foodstuff</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/ascendepermaandthemembranes">https://archive.org/details/ascendepermaandthemembranes</a></p>
<p>mmmh... i woke up this morning thinking about the german text i wrote till into deep into the night and how happy i was to have found this trinity of </p>
<p>1 ) personal individual sovereignity</p>
<p>2 ) local sovereign community</p>
<p>3 ) personal individual sovereign supported by the local sovereign community achieves dissolving the borders between human animal and plant existance, evolves into a multispecies being what enjoys the flows of elemental powers fueling its transformation</p>
<p>i remember how i speculated about what it possibly need first for the others to come into existance ... its a bit complicated ... like...</p>
<p>i believe it needs first of all the wish of the individual to be free</p>
<p>to see trough all the dependancies from fellow human beings and to systematicly deconstruct these dependancies on a mental level </p>
<p>this would then automaticly lead to the pillar of strength what one can draw from knowing that everyone human being should be able to choose at all times what to do with whom or on ones own</p>
<p>this knowing of the human being not necessarily needing to be at all times connecting to other fellow human beings but one could just very well be happy talking to the carrots and onions what will nourish one during the coming winter months, one enjoying to build ones own house/hut from clay and straw/hempstalks ... one knitting weaving ones own clothes from nettle fibres, flax or hemp ...</p>
<p>would then automaticly lead to this conclusion that basicly all this human forbidding each other to do this or that ... all these duties and demandings human beings do burden each other with ... are basicly hindering the evolution of the human being who has found its connection to the very planet, the one single human being who is dedicated to get into a deeper relationship with mother earth</p>

        <p>so </p>
<p>first might be the awareness</p>
<p>that demanding taxes to finance courts, police and prison what threatens anyone to comply with  forcing children and youth into compulsory education, all the while prohibiting the people to use drugs/substances/plants ...,  what possibly would allow them to heal from these compulsory education horrors and all the other coercion adults put onto children during their first 18 years of life in the prison what is called "adult supervision" ...</p>
<p>just to be forced/conscripted into serving in the military or civil service duty ... </p>
<p>ah ... its a heap of coercions with all the very same intention:</p>
<p>make the individual single human being forget that one is not dependant onto other human beings ... make them suffer so much from their wishes being disrespected at all times so they finally break and begin to become a part of the system</p>
<p>the system what nourishes itself from the very life energy of the individual who has replaced the concept of personal sovereignity with obediance towards the hierarchies in order to become a part of the hierarchies and at one time get a chance to be the one who is at the top to give the commandos where when to force whom into obediance</p>
<p>to understand this is the very beginning of it all</p>
<p>and then as a second step comes the envisioning of an alternative </p>
<p>how would people live together who do not enjoy breaking each others free will</p>
<p>how would people live together who respect and uphold the ideal of personal sovereignity</p>
<p>what then leads eventually to the very concept of the local community being its own political sovereign</p>
<p>we who live here together as neighbours decide all matters of the community together, everyone with the same weighted voting power</p>
<p>every child, youth and adult who lives here in this local sovereign community ... this village, this town, this city-district ... having the very same voting power</p>
<p>the full assembly of all inhabitants the institution, the vessel where the law gets created, the rules what apply here and now</p>
<p>to make sure that there is a great correspondance between the inhabitants and the rules ... a qualified majority ( 60-75 % ) could be aspired ... or even a consensus ... 100 percent agreement on a rule would be looked for</p>
<p>now having arrived at this understanding of how personal sovereignity can be supported by local communal political sovereignity ... like ...</p>
<p>to free our fellow newborn citizens from this horrible compulsory education threat ... it would need the local sovereign community to be able to create its own local law</p>
<p>or eventually the regional states or and nation states would come round to abolishing compulsory education laws ...</p>
<p>possible ...</p>
<p>but still ... i actually believe that it would be most beneficial for the human devellopment to choose the local community its own sovereign path ... so that every local community could choose on their very own in what timeframe they would want to relieve each other from all the tax demands, compulsory education, prohibition of drugs, conscription into armed service and all the other strange laws people think of how to torture their fellow human beings ... like for example the law what demands an individual to cover its mouth and nose with a mask what filters the air one inhales/exhales ....</p>
<p>therefore the argument here could be that it needs a local sovereign community to free the individual from these stupid demands human have a go at each other ...</p>
<p>or one just wiggles out of it ... like ... travels the world as a globetrotter to evade being surveilled too closely by the ones who spend their time making sure everyone gets equally harassed by the system rules</p>
<p>but this has gotten recently a lot more complicated since the littlest of tiny fellow living beings ... the virus ... have been declared enemies</p>
<p>i was happy to have recently read this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/?fbclid=IwAR0A_48t3wswQvkeAnLiODLRBNbFLlWYkF9NYc202hkkLf2Zq6n6Ur694-A">https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/</a></p>
<p>"(...)we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of  viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing  something positive and having a beneficial role.(...)"</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>mmmh... so after one has analyzed this human society as basicly a free will destruction machine and one has found the sollution with the combination of personal sovereignity and local community political sovereignity ...</p>
<p>the biggest part of the liberation is basicly done</p>
<p>as the most prized possession on this planet is not gold or diamonds, its not the billions of dollars on a bank account ... its not how much land is written to ones name in the land registry ....</p>
<p>the most prized possession of a human being who is caught in hoarding ...</p>
<p>is the submission of fellow human beings, the admiration one gets for having hoarded all these stolen riches and stolen lands</p>
<p>as soon as the individual human being understands that the amassement of financial and material wealth at most all of the times is based on exploiting others</p>
<p>as soon as the individual human being has sucessfully made the connection between tax demands to finance police and military, compulsory education, drug prohibition and conscription into armed services ... made the connection of how all these demands and duties and obligations serve to direct the individuals attention towards these few individuals who are sitting on heaps of money and have huge landscapes written to their names</p>
<p>it all crumbles in an instant</p>
<p>all the admiration turns into a feeling of having been betrayed all ones life, having been exploited</p>
<p>and one wants to get out of this abusive system</p>
<p>mmmh... of course this renewal of the state constitutions towards full decentralisation</p>
<p>what i do think has a real chance of being sucessfull</p>
<p>might take some time and or awareness to come into existance</p>
<p>but it might also be achievable within a few years</p>
<p>it all depends on the mental clarity of the human being</p>
<p>being able to see what one really needs in life to be free</p>
