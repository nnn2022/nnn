<p>No, I probably wouldn’t wear one then because... how would I know to? But nobody needed to tell me wearing a mask was the right thing to do. Those dots were pretty easy to connect on my own. Kind of a no brainer</p>

<p>Somewhere down the future someone will tell you to take off the mask. Then you will breathe freely again. Until then you’ll feel virtuous posting on reddit that you have a petri dish strapped to your face, because your tv told you that is what ‘nice’ people do. </p>

        <p>You don’t know it because you’re not smart enough to understand but people like me are getting dragged through the mud to make sure you don’t spend the rest of your life in a camp somewhere under the government boot. You’re probably too young to remember 9/11 but when the government put a boot on us then, they never took it off. Those of us not content to allow the government to separate us from other humans and lock us in our homes have experience with the government never again giving back any of the power they’ve taken. Hope you’re cool living like this and worse the rest of your life. I’m not and I’m fighting to ensure we don’t have to “live” like this until we die eventually. You’re welcome you piece of shit.</p>

        <p>Buddy you sound like a nut. I do remember 9/11, and the patriot act and cooked up excuses for torture and illegal war are NOT AT ALL SIMILAR to the current half-baked government response to covid.  Here’s the thing I’m learning by reading this sub. The people on here are so deeply invested in this bizarre worldview, where you are some sort of last gasp of personal liberty, that it’s impossible to really have a rational conversation (although, tbh, I was trolling.) But how about this. In about 6 months, when a vaccine will hopefully have been widely circulated and we don’t have to have shutdowns, let’s circle back to this conversation. See if, as you say, “the government never took the boot off”. Let’s just see. !RemindMe 6 Months</p>

        <p>I’ll leave this here.</p>
<p>You are confusing me for a Republican.  I am concerned with the pollution of industry and fracking et cet.  Unfortunately it’s very hard to vote on individual issues like that.</p>
<p>And if you think that liberal politicians who pine on about climate change policies while at the same time support China and the offshoring of our manufacturing care about the environment any more than the republicans you are lying to yourself.</p>
<p>The us has better manufacturing capabilities and controls than any nation on earth yet we’ve off-shored all of that control and oversight that we could have to China.  And if you think China is serious about cutting emissions then I don’t know what to tell you other than you will fit in very well after their inevitable takeover</p>

        <p>I mean, I don’t disagree with your points (till you veered into that whole “people who don’t think like me are setting the stage for authoritarian takeover” mindset that is so common on this sub). </p>
<p>I don’t assume you’re Republican. Yeah, there’s a correlation between people who don’t think covid is a big deal and Republicans, but I don’t think I have enough info on anyone’s political affiliation on here to make a call. I mentioned climate change just because you brought it up. </p>
<p>China is an immense problem in the global community for many reasons- pollution and carbon emissions included. Their practices around live animal markets as well as clamping down on free information directly resulted in this pandemic (although the US’ practices of factory farming livestock are equally barbaric as well as problematic from a public health standpoint). I’m not convinced that any politician really knows what to do about the growing Chinese problem. The past two administrations clearly had different philosophies and I’m not sure either was particularly successful. I tend to lean towards the viewpoint that Obama’s strategy of slow pressure and out-maneuvering them for clout and advantage on the global stage would have long term worked better than Trump’s aggressiveness, but I’m not an expert- and I’m also not in charge. </p>
<p>Anyway, we’ve veered away from discussing covid restrictions (fine with me. When I’m not teaching a class I like a good tangent). If you want to talk further you’re welcome to send me a message, I’m only allowed to post here something like every half hour it seems.</p>

        <p>Do you drive? Have you seen the science behind how dangerous driving is? It's not enough to pull the license of those at risk we need safe drivers off the road until driving technology leads to no deaths. For instance you may be drunk before you drive! You'd kill other people! We have to assume you're drunk to be safe! How hard is it to just not drive lol?</p>

        <p>This is the type of analogy only a dumb person could come up with. It's not comparable.</p>
<p>Driving while drunk is also illegal to protect people. The reason we have lockdown is also to protect people. You guys are arguing that we should forego all government regulations that protect people from covid. Why are you not arguing that everyone should be able to drive drunk and without a license or any training too? Hypocrites.</p>

        <p>Nah, it's minimise where I'm from. Look it up. Fuck sake.</p>
<p>What you think doesn't matter as you don't know what the word pandemic even means.</p>
<p>You've lost your income because of the pandemic and you're advocating the pandemic to go on lol. Pandemics always impact the economy. That's why you lock down to get rid of them fast instead of dragging it out. </p>
<p>You probably also voted republican. A party that has actively worked to not help out people like you. You're just too stupid to see you're working against your own interests.</p>
<p>All studies on this pandemic and past pandemics show that countries that implemented strict restrictions that reduced infection rates had a much faster economic recovery and better long term economic outlook, than countries who tried to keep society open like there wasn't a pandemic. Consumer confidence plummeted of course as the virus ripped through the country, and took much longer to rebound.</p>
<p>It's been since March, not a year. And most countries haven't been in full lockdown for a majority of the period, but only a few months at a time. Stop with the dumb exaggerations.</p>
<p>The lockdown will go on as long as the infection rate is so high it's needed. Once it goes down restrictions are lifted. Once it goes up again restrictions are put back in. Once the vaccine is dessimenated everything will be back to normal. This is how you deal with a pandemic, and it's based on decades and decades of epidemiological research. What people like you think of it frankly doesn't matter as you've no clue whatsoever about epidemiology or economics. </p>
<p>No one is, will or should listen to you.</p>

        <p>Is dessiminated a word where you’re from too? </p>
<p>Lol, so you’re seriously trying to pretend that Florida has a worse economic slump than NY or California? Or that Switzerland is worse off than Italy or Belgium? </p>
<p>NY, California, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy = heavy lockdowns, massive amount of bankruptcies, lead the charts in deaths per capita. </p>
<p>Florida, South Carolina, Switzerland, Taiwan - no lockdowns or light, short ones, reaping the benefits of being the few prosperous areas in a world gripped by fear-induced insanity. Also, way fewer deaths than the former. </p>
<p>But hey! Your tv told you otherwise and you wouldn’t want to be on the wrong side of mainstream opinion. </p>
<p>I want the ‘pandemic’ to stop, which will happen as soon as morons like you realize it’s endemic by now and you can’t eradicate a very contagious virus that has spread to all countries in any period smaller than a century. Vaccine and all. We have a flu vaccine, don’t we? </p>
<p>Course I voted Republican, which means I don’t confuse the government with my parents, and think it’s responsible for me. I also grew up and gave up making decisions based on media-produced fear. </p>
<p>Once the mainstream media changes their tune (which they will when the real toll of these ‘life saving’ lockdowns becomes clear) so will you. You might even pretend you were never for lockdowns to begin with. It’s sad, but true.</p>

        <p>&rt;Lol, so you’re seriously trying to pretend that Florida has a worse economic slump than NY or California? Or that Switzerland is worse off than Italy or Belgium?</p>
<p>If you read what I actually wrote. We're not talking about the current economic impact. We're talking about the long-term economic consequences.</p>
<p>Switzerland has had the same restrictions as Italy and Belgium. But obviously there's other random factors that impact how the infection rate spreads. Trust in government for example, which is low in Belgium, or how centralised the government is. This is way above your head.</p>
<p>&rt;NY, California, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy = heavy lockdowns, massive amount of bankruptcies, lead the charts in deaths per capita.</p>
<p>The European countries have not had massive amounts of bankruptcies. That's a lie. In Europe the government has stepped in and helped businesses that struggle. In the US there's more bankruptcies because the federal government doesn't give a shit.</p>
<p>&rt;Florida, South Carolina, Switzerland, Taiwan - no lockdowns or light, short ones, reaping the benefits of being the few prosperous areas in a world gripped by fear-induced insanity. Also, way fewer deaths than the former.</p>
<p>Switzerland has had stricter restrictions than the US. You actually have no idea what European countries are doing. That's extremely clear. And you've no idea what Taiwan is doing either.</p>
<p>Florida hasn't had few cases or deaths lol.</p>
<p>&rt;Your tv </p>
<p>I don't watch TV.</p>
<p>&rt;I want the ‘pandemic’ to stop, which will happen as soon as morons like you realize it’s endemic by now and you can’t eradicate a very contagious virus that has spread to all countries in any period smaller than a century. Vaccine and all. We have a flu vaccine, don’t we?</p>
<p>Then you need to listen to government like a smart person. No one is trying to eradicate the virus. Stop making shit up. If you don't know by now what the strategy is then you're a lost cause. And do I really have to explain to you how the seasonal flu is different from this virus? </p>
<p>&rt;Course I voted Republican</p>
<p>Lol. And you're complaining about losing your income and job. You're a fucking idiot.</p>
<p>&rt;gave up making decisions based on media-produced fear.</p>
<p>Good for you. But in this case it's the government telling us what to do to avoid the virus killing more people than necessary.</p>
<p>&rt;Once the mainstream media changes their tune (which they will when the real toll of these ‘life saving’ lockdowns becomes clear) so will you</p>
<p>They won't. Your conspiracy bullshit isn't actually connected to reality.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was. I traveled all through Europe this summer. I’ve also been to almost 100 countries. AND I have family in Switzerland. So I call bullshit on your fake narrative. Switzerland barely closed up, is open now, and doing better than Belgium, France, Spain, UK, California, Holland, Italy, Greece, and all the other places that closed up for months on end, twice or thrice. </p>
<p>It’s like talking to a wall. You’re so married to your fear that you refuse any scrap of good news. Cause it’s good news! Shutting down nations and installing a ‘temporary’ police state is unnecessary. </p>

<p>Let's have a look at the measures in Switzerland then.</p>
<p>Almost 75% of ICU capacity is full now in CH. On 22 Dec they closed all restaurants and bars, sports and recreation centres and other cultural institutions for a month because cases were rising too fast. The government also urged people to stay home.</p>
<p>During the Spring CH also imposed strict restriction and lockdown with good effect. In summer cases kept creeping upward. In mid October they made masks mandatory in all enclosed public spaces. Private events were to be avoided at all costs. On October 28, the government, admitting that the existing measures were "insufficient", ordered dance clubs to be closed from October 29, halted in-person university classes from November 2, and placed new limits on sporting and leisure activities.</p>
<p>And now: </p>
<p>&rt; In view of the worrying, stagnating situation, on December 11, the Federal Council confirmed a raft of new national measures. These include a ban on all public events apart from church services and legislative meetings. Restaurants, bars and shops, museums, libraries, sports and leisure facilities are to close from 7pm from December 12 until January 22. The federal government announced new measures on December 18. Switzerland will close restaurants and bars for a month from December 22 to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, while ski areas can remain open, the government says. Shops will also remain open but sports and leisure centres, as well as libraries, museums and other cultural institutions are to close.</p>
<p>https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/covid-19_coronavirus--the-situation-in-switzerland/45592192</p>
<p>Seems you're full of bullshit, as I always said. CH have the exact same measures now as most of Europe. Lockdown. Because cases aren't going down.</p>
<p>Nothing but strict restriction works to keep cases as low as they have to be to avoid hospitals going over capacity and an unnecessary high amount of people dying.</p>
<p>You are too stupid to process reality.</p>

<p>Ski resorts are open in Switzerland. So are hotels. In most cantons, so are restaurants and schools. </p>
<p>Their first lockdown was short, unlike Italy’s four-month long one, and was lifted without any mask requirement. </p>
<p>Try going skiing today in Italy or France and tell me it’s the same thing. I get your whole narrative depends on it, but have some dignity for crying out loud. </p>

        <p>Lol of course, it's not the right kind of lockdown..I guess only if ski resorts are closed it's a lockdown? You're a fucking weasel. You lost the argument and now you're trying to weasel yourself out of it.</p>
<p>Hotels are open in France and Italy too, and ski resorts are opening in a few days for the season. Schools are open in most of Europe, along with restaurants with restrictive measures. We still call it lockdown. Switzerland has a mask mandate now, after seeing the evidence they work. Switzerland is doing most of the stuff you complained about, and is currently a lot more restrictive than most of the US. All this boils down to the conclusion you have no legitimate argument. Keep on ignoring science and see how far you get in life lol. Redneck.</p>

        <p>This is no longer an inconvenience. It is a full and permanent assault on being human. The government does not ever want us to experience joy ever again or gather with people we love ever again. I’m sorry you can’t see that. You’ll probably wake up only when it’s too late and you realize that it’s been years of this and nothing has or will change. You are going to lose.</p>

        <p>Well...yes...this response to this virus has driven me insane. I can’t visit with people without someone having a problem with it no matter the precautions I take. I can’t exercise without someone having a problem with it. I cannot do anything I used to do to manage my mental health without someone now having a problem with it and even when I’m “staying the fuck home”, someone is undoubtedly still telling me to stay the fuck home. And I’m surrounded by people who seem content to never again do anything enjoyable ever again. So yes I’m going insane or already there.</p>

        <p>'Rebels.' Lol. As if the anti-maskers aren't basically a zombie mob parroting everything they hear from Facebook. Bro, you can't even handle wearing a piece of cloth on your face. Rebels are people who radically try to bring positive change. People who went against the normal for human rights. Like women's suffrage or black suffrage. Not 'my right to go party and kill my elderly neighbor'. </p>

        <p>This is America.  It simply does not matter how many people may get sick or die, our way of life is not negotiable.  Over a million American soldiers have given their lives for the freedom you socialist cowards and freaks want us to willingly surrender.   American global exceptionalism is rooted in our willingness to consistently place liberty above life itself.  It is that liberty, which absolutely includes our capitalist economy, that is the reason why millions of people around the planet want to come and live in this nation.  My family is one of the lucky ones who got to have the American dream that you want to destroy today.   Not on my watch, and not with my consent.  </p>
<p>Freedom and capitalism are inextricably linked in our constitutional republic.  Only over my dead body will you socialist punks destroy American capitalism and our liberty.  I don’t care how many people may get sick with COVID-19 or how many may die - the American capitalism and our way of life are simply NOT negotiable and America is most certainly worth risking my own life.  As Americans, we do not run from flu bugs, we don’t surrender our liberty, and we don’t snitch on our neighbors.  </p>

<p>We're only fighting for stupid meaningless rights like freedom of movement, freedom of assembly, freedom to make a living, freedom to refuse being subjected to medical testing and freedom of speech. Such dumb stuff compared to the right to vote, I know!</p>

        <p>Freedom of movement - whether this is literal or figurative, I don't know. If literal, then yeah it has always been obstructed, nobody wants you to walk into military testing grounds or an active warzone. Figuratively, then no. Nobody is silencing your voices, you're allowed to have an anti-mask, anti-lockdown movement. Just because people are criticizing it doesn't invalidate its existence. </p>
<p>Freedom of assembly - it's obstructed because people can die. Also, it isn't even a human right. I would get if it was freedom of peaceful protest, but considering we're dealing with a virus that spreads through human contact, no, it isn't peaceful. Also there is no mention of any actual protest in freedom of assembly. </p>
<p>Freedom to make a living - this one is actually valid. The economy is put on hold because of the virus, but people need to sustain themselves. It wouldn't have been a problem if the current US administration wasn't as incompetent as it is. </p>
<p>Freedom to refuse being subjected to medical testing - not obstructed. You are completely within your right to refuse. All the vaccine test subjects were volunteers.  </p>
<p>Freedom of speech - not obstructed. You need to realize freedom of speech includes subjection to debate or differing opinions. A right is something that is protected by the government at all costs. Freedom of speech means that the government stops your neighbors from tying you down and putting duct tape over your mouth when you want to say something. Your neighbors are not doing that; as long as they don't stop you from speaking they are well within their right to criticize what you say.</p>

        <p>Freedom of movement: Stating previous wrong doing doesn't justify a current wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Freedom of assembly: Same as with freedom of movement, it is a natural human right. Stopping protests or mandating how many people may gather in a place is human rights violation.</p>
<p>Freedom to make a living: glad we agree. But we may not agree about how economy works. The way I see it: printing more money means more poverty in the future.</p>
<p>Freedom to refuse being subjected to medical testing: Not obstructed <em>yet.</em> There has been a lot of talk about mandatory or coerced vaccinations. Bear in mind all of the new Covid19 vaccines currently being launched or underway to launch are still experimental and are being launched under "emergency authorization".</p>
<p>Freedom of speech: major platforms moving into more and more soviet style banning of wrongthink is a worrying sight. Your definition of a right is wrong by the way. It has nothing to do with governments. A natural right is something that is <em>inalienable,</em> meaning it can not be taken away. You can try to take away my freedom of speech and you'll be a god damn despot for that but until all spirit of humanity is gone, people will want to speech freely.</p>
