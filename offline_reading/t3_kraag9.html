    <strong>Whats sad is I think people are expecting an "All Clear"</strong>
    <p><p>I think the reason we aren't seeing wayyyyy more people on the skeptical side of things is because of this expectation. Your Average Joe and Jane are thinking that if they follow the rules, do their part, then one day a switch will flip. The governments will deem a day "National Take off Your Mask Day" or something along those lines. Everything will open, festivals are back on, etc. Sadly with the news coming around of mutant strains and to mask even if vaccinated, this doesn't end until we decide it does.</p>
<p>I wish I didn't live in some bodunk town or else I'd do more to spread word but this is what I got. Hope you all are having as a best a day as you can.</p></p>

        <p>What people hate more than anything is when you act like this is permanent. I've found this to be an excellent way to make doomers rethink their stance - giving data and stats doesn't work, sharing your troubles and begging for sympathy doesn't work, what really works is making changes in your life like this is really permanent. I'm moving to another town to work/study in a field which would suit me decently regardless of lockdown, but is exceptionally suitable for me during lockdown. This has pissed off basically everyone in my life.</p>
<p>Deep down, regardless of the shit they spew on social media, most people want normal back. When you make a big change in your life acting against the assumption of normality, it really fries their brains.</p>

        <p>I hate that I sometimes have to be so blunt when I type shit on here but I'm a no-nonsense kind of guy when it comes to certain things and to be quite honest with you... nobody is going to give us the "All Clear" and "it's safe to come outside now", want freedom and the old normal? get outside without the mask and take your fucking freedom back because nobody on this planet is going to give that back to you!</p>

        <p>Yep. </p>
<p>It’s weird to say this, but I’m almost thankful I was raised in an abusive household right about now. </p>
<p>You see, the people who were supposed to protect me were the ones I was most scared of. I learned from an early age that those in authority were not necessarily working for my good, even if they were supposed to. No matter what conditions you thought might spare you, it always turned out that it was never enough. There was always some rule you didn’t know about that you got in trouble for not following, some unreasonable punishment, or some seemingly innocent faux pas that got you physically reprimanded. </p>
<p>This is what we are living in. The only way it stops is if you choose not to oblige any longer.</p>

        <p>Same. I was actually raised in a family where I was privileged in many ways, but emotionally abused. So it was confusing. I had materially what I wanted, but something was off. The gaslighting. I was always VERY feisty though and called my mum out at 14. But I was still a child and it hurt. To be fair, she didn't know she was doing it and now we are kind of friends. She's a bit weird and spikey but there are good things about her - she taught me to speak up against others even if she did manipulate me herself. The point is, I've always had issues with authority. I never assumed they were the good guys. I kind of knew if something was off and it's done me a lot of favours. So many other people have limits to their lives 'I can't do this, that's too unconventional or not normal' whereas I had to seek out different ways of thinking and being as a teenager.</p>

        <p>Yep. I think the attitude that it’ll end “once the vaccine is distributed” or “when we get Covid under control” stems from an inability (or more often, a refusal) to acknowledge the reality of human nature and the fact that evil exists. </p>
<p>People in power, generally speaking, do not want to give it up, will go to great lengths to further entrench themselves in powerful positions and will expand their power if given the opportunity. This should be obvious to anyone who has the faintest familiarity with world history. In order for the political, economic and cultural elite to gain more power, they have to take it from the general public and have been known to use extremely evil means of doing so. Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Chavez, Nero, Saddam, Genghis Khan are just a few examples and in each case they were coordinating with other powerful people to accomplish their goals. It is not out of the question that this is now happening on a more global level (altho the reach of the Axis powers was pretty global) to consolidate power in the hands of a global elite at the expense of the general global population. However, this is a very unpleasant conclusion to come to and I believe most people would rather stick their heads in the sand. If this is in fact the case (and I believe it is), there are two outcomes: (i) the global elite gets their way and things become VERY unpleasant for just about everyone on earth or (ii) we revolt in an attempt to stop them, which would also makes things extremely unpleasant (at least in the short term). </p>
<p>This is just not something people want to admit is even possible so they just reject the possibility without any sort of critical analysis of what’s going on in the world and what possible explanations there could be for the fact that world leaders all seem to have simultaneously lost their minds and become dictators. Claims of genocide in Germany were similarly dismissed until 1944 when the evidence could no longer be ignored. I think intellectual, emotional and moral courage is needed to fix the problem but beats me how the hell we encourage the general population to foster those traits (especially in the wealthy, pampered, victim-fetishizing West (I’m American)).</p>

        <p>So I came over here to comment because I liked your comment on my post and wanted to see what else you have to say. I largely agree. An 'all clear' won't happen. Whilst I think there are bad actors at work, I'm not convinced it's as coordinated as everyone thinks. I think that some groups have seen it as an opportunity. Doctors in the UK who hate the Tories. SAGE science advisors who are communist party members and far leftists. Journalists to further their careers. And WHO of course. And yes, climate change activists with agendas. I don't think they are all plotting it's like convergence of interests rather than a huge conspiracy. But still VERY worrying. In the UK, Johnson is rolling out his green plan which will bankrupt the country. Equally there are a ton of people pushing back. I don't think these people will be able to control and manage billions of people across the world without serious problems. I remain optimistic because I have to be!</p>

        <p>Yeah no I actually largely agree with you! I think there’s some coordinated effort and then an intentional aligning of interests between various groups to accomplish the goals of those coordinating it. </p>
<p>I guess a company like CNN would be a good example. It’s owned by PE funds that have a huge financial incentive to keep business booming in China. They give management the marching orders to not offend China. Then you have a bunch of brainwashed/ideologically possessed journalists and reporters who go along with it because they truly believe they’re doing the right thing. So, in that entire vertical structure, you might only have 20 people who, if they were being honest with themselves (and that’s a big if), would admit they’re effectively working for China. And even THOSE people likely refuse to acknowledge the reality that China is trying to take over the world and doing their bidding is likely to be v bad in the long run.  </p>
<p>I think you just have a bunch of people in positions of power who are beholden to China in some way (some of them directly and some of them very indirectly) and so you have large institutions and organizations all working to do what China wants even though of course they’re not all literally CCP assets. </p>
<p>I do think that a small group of people like Gates, Soros, Schwab, etc are coordinating to implement a plan. But also none of them ever called me up and told me that lol so it’s just what I’ve concluded seems likely based on their behavior and def could be wrong. Then I think China comes into it bc they have the same short term goal as this group: destroy and replace systems of government that provide strong protections on individual liberties.</p>

        <p>Oh yes, this is what's happening. It's just money. They are too reliant on China so work in their interests. My thinking is that the genie's out the bottle now. They have overplayed their hand. Most people know that something's off about China and no one wants that. Nigel Farage in the UK is being vocal about it and he's a key media figure. Many others are too. Also China are too big for their boots, being too obvious and smug, with well-placed articles and comments on youtube. They've been clever to date but got too ahead of themselves. They have received some praise from bootlickers in the UK for 'getting on top of the virus' but LOL. They suddenly believe everything China reports...whatever. Such bullshit. I honestly think that we need to get this all over and done with fast. We don't want another ten years of underhand tactics and something much worse. Let these agents expose themselves and let's get people talking out a lot against China. I'm not entirely sure this will happen easily - after all Beijing Biden is in power (probably) and the EU's just done a massive deal with China. But I think we will see just how dangerous China is in the next two years and there will be a backlash. I hate to say it but Trump was the bulwark against China. We need someone like him. And as for Gates etc working together...that's potentially true, like psychopaths together being weird. Klaus Scwabb tested the water and came on Twitter and was ridiculed...so I can't help thinking that they won't get very far. People don't like these types telling us what to do. A very small weird cabal do in the UK - they have power but no one would EVER vote for it. So they've taken their chance but I don't think they will be able to do it because there's too much information available now. Oh and in terms of climate change - do you think people will buy into this once the scientists are discredited? I don't think so! People will be very sceptical after all this.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure here in the UK they have spent £22billion+ on a track and trace app. It started off 12billion but soon after jumped to 22. This aint ending soon, and I have my money on it getting worse and lasting years. It ends when we say it ends.</p>
