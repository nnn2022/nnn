        <p>Lol, as a former Bernie Bro, i can assure you that Democratic Socialism was never close to happening.  The ruling class in the Democratic Party shut it down Super Tuesday with barely any effort. A few phone calls from Obama and we were done for.</p>
<p>Really what happened was that after Bernie's defeat, the press needed something else to fear monger about until the election.</p>
<p>It is an interesting question  though, what is "it" that is happening? I am not sure there really is a space or title for the current political framework for the lockdowns. Its clearly being pushed by the democrat governors and there is a heavy dose of anti-trump - which is why and how things have persisted for so long, at least in my opinion. However I still feel the lockdown narrative does not fit into a neat political box.</p>
<p>I am reminded of the thesis of a book called "Voltaire's Bastard's" - which is about the dictatorship of reason.  Basically the book details how the management class in the West has taken control of our daily lives to with no sense or purpose.  From a summary of the book:</p>
<p>&rt; In a wide-ranging, provocative anatomy of modern society and its origins, John Ralston Saul explores the reason for our deepening sense of crisis and confusion. Throughout the Western world we talk end lessly of individual freedom, yet Saul shows that there has never before been such pressure for conformity.  [...] This paradox arises from a simple truth which our elites deny: far from being a moral force, reason is no more than an administrative method. Their denial has helped to turn the modern West into a vast, incomprehensible, direction less machine, run by process-minded experts – “Voltaire’s bastards” – whose cult of scientific management is bereft of both sense and morality. Whether in politics, art, business, the military, entertainment, science, finance, academia or journalism, these experts share the same outlook and methods. The result, Saul maintains, is a civilization of immense technological power whose peoples increasingly dwell in a world of illusion.</p>
<p>Pretty much spot on to what is happening now.</p>

        <p>How does depopulation sound wonderful in theory ? 2030 Sustainable agenda mainly focuses on population control, decreasing it and big government control in order to enact the agenda.</p>
<p>Add the great reset and global communism to the agenda now, Deep AI and Automation will cover decent amount of jobs by 2030. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/</a> </p>
<p>To achieve a better outcome, the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions. Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed. In short, we need a “Great Reset” of capitalism.</p>

        <p>RanmanAlkie, you at least earned my respect. Don't worry about all the downvotes you're getting - downvotes mean very little when your audience is full of children and old folk with dementia. </p>
<p>I had no intention of actually engaging in productive debate with anyone on this sub, as it would most likely be an absolute waste of effort and time. I simpy needed to vent my frustration with the world. However, your attitude is so absolutely on the money that I'd now be happy to have a polite and respectful conversation with you about this. Using the reddit message function, however, not here. Here there are children around.</p>

<p>Frankly engaging in debate no matter what the position is is a waste of time because most people are so resistant to changing their beliefs on an issue.  When it does happen, I believe it's the end of a long process of self-reflection and not simply being proven wrong in a single debate.</p>
<p>That said, this sub can be pretty over-the-top and meme-y with its resistance to lockdowns, by design; it's a bit more of a place to vent.  There's another sub, /r/LockdownSkepticism, that's very heavily moderated and many of the posts are links to studies about the virus.  People who believe in the lockdown measures are welcomed over there if they're willing to engage in a respectful way.</p>

        <p>How can you not realize that this is a farce. Most corona virus cases result in mild symptoms that are never recorded while you all focus on the few sever cases. If we sat around and focused on the worst cases for disease all the time we would be locked down forever, life inherently involves risk and the risk of this is minimum.</p>
