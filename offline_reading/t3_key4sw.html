    <strong>Dear God</strong>
    <p><p>Dear God, or the Evolutionary process (whichever one made the human body)</p>
<p>I no longer trust the immune system that was given to me and which evolved with my ancestors over millennia. It must be flawed because a terrible plague is devouring humanity.</p>
<p>Therefore I've decided to place my trust in some of our leaders instead, who say they can manipulate my system to make it a lot better. Also they really care about us and they know a lot about science.</p>
<p>Sure it's an experimental procedure, but it doesn't sound like anything can go wrong. And actually I've not had much time to look into the details.</p>
<p>I think if everybody trusts them and does as they say we'll beat the disease and get our lives back.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything you've done up to now, but with this one I don't think you're quite up to it and I've decided to go another route.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Monty</p></p>

        <p>Generally there's more covid in 'global cities' and less covid in 'redneck lost villages'.</p>
<p>I think global pandemics are the way our bodies adapt to globalization. Spanish flu of 1918 also coincided with world urbanization wave. COVID came because globalization. We live in 10 million people cities now, so our immune systems have to evolve. Before COVID there were SARS and swine flu, and they spread a bit differently, and they didn't succeed. COVID found a way to spread by air, dispropotionally affecting travelers, elderly and cruise ships for some reason, so it was really a matter of time once one of the new respiratory viruses succeeds to cause the shitshow we observe now.</p>
<p>The thing is, we need to evolve and adapt to live with COVID. It is unlikely that govenrments will reverse globalization and destroy cities just because 'no new viruses allowed'.</p>
<p>If you flip it the religious way, COVID is the punishment for globalization, however I think we'll just pay the fine and move on with continuing it.</p>
