    <strong>Why are you on this sub?</strong>
    <p><p>Question seems obvious and maybe a bit stupid. However, I think there are a lot of valid reasons to be opposed to the handling of this stuff.</p>
<p>My reason to be against lockdowns and all the accompanying stuff is mostly because I have seen how they affect people, especially children with whose families I am close. I live in a small village and from what I see, most people treat the situation with relatively little care, they meet each other - like they should be able to - and so on. There is no "outbreak" or something so I am under the impression that Covid is not that dangerous. I myself have met hundreds of people in close contact and thousands of people casually since the start of the pandemic and have not gotten the virus. I know people get sick of it and I also know people who died from Covid, but even though each individual death is tragic, the numbers on a societal scale are so irrelevant it´s hard to imagine how such measures are justifyable. Through all of that I developed a deep mistrust in mainstream media and the government.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I guess this explains my reason to be here. I´d love to hear yours or answer questions if I didn´t make my point clear enough.</p></p>

        <p>When quoting these numbers, please give context. What is the average age of death? What were the average number of comorbidities? How are these deaths recorded? Are the deaths recorded in the same way as deaths from other illnesses? Are there any conflicts of interest that could occur in reporting of these deaths? What is the risk level for healthy people? How many deaths do you believe lockdown has prevented? Why is there no correlation in mortality outcome between states with harsh restrictions vs states with no or minimal restrictions? Why are countries like Sweden who had minimal restrictions showing no abnormal number of total excess deaths per capita when compared to previous years?</p>
<p>Answer all those questions, truthfully, then we can have a sensible, non-emotional discussion about what is happening, rather than throwing around big meaningless numbers.</p>

        <p>one thing. have you ever tried doing some maths? 400,000 people is a large number, but the US has over 330 million people. how large a percentage is 400,000 of that? do you really think such a low percentage justifies such draconian measures?</p>

        <p>I did a quick google search. do you know that last year, over 600,000 people in the US died from cancer. granted, cancer is no virus, but it is more deadly than Kung Flu in a 1 year period. so, do you take the same/equal precautions to prevent the impact of cancer? do you take these deaths as serious as you do the Kung Flu deaths? I´m sure you don´t.</p>
<p>I know more people who died or are dying from cancer than I do who died from Kung Flu. I know it´s a cruel death. yet nobody even thinks about taking precautions against cancer. and the development of treatments is done through years of research, not rushed in a couple of months</p>

        <p>I am using my own mind lol I use it to believe the facts presented to me. And the difference between cancer and Covid is one has been around for hundreds of years while the other is a brand new virus. “Draconian” measures are what’s needed to help curb it to stop people from dying. You just find those measures inconvenient and are searching for a way to complain about them.</p>

        <p>seriously? using your own mind means you should be able to question things. maybe stuff the government/health officials is correct, or partially correct or (partially) wrong. but you will never know that if you just accept whatever they throw at you. and to make this clear: if what they say is true, then I would have a much easier time taking their measures seriously. but from what I see, this pandemic isn´t as dangerous as they make it out to be.</p>
<p>what I really want to see once this is over is a full analysis of age groups and their risk of getting sick, the measures and their impact on the spread, external factors like weather and a bunch of other factors, all combined in a huge "pandemic study" by a couple different scientists. I think that would really help understand how this all played out and what we can learn for the future, because I think that is the most important aspect of such events</p>

        <p>I’ve been alone for a year and I’ve lost much of the will to speak to others at all and I don’t talk to my family for reasons from before covid, so this is really the only place I have a chance of expressing my thoughts to someone else. I’m usually an outgoing person, super upbeat in public or whenever I was working (even if I was miserable). I like to talk to people on the street, etc. Sometimes I just like smiling because I know it helps me when I see someone smile.. now it’s all gone and I just need some other people to just exist with me because this hermit crab peeking out his window is not who I am...</p>

        <p>Answer: Got tired of the "New Normal" back when they were first pushing it in February.</p>
<p>My mother and I had an argument about how I saw this was obviously overreaction to a virus that to the majority of people was weak sauce.</p>
<p>Even though Mom died to this disease, I still have not taken that back because by the numbers, she shouldn't have died from it because she was healthier than me.</p>
<p>I think Mom's death was due to the g'damned ventilator being used on her and if I could go back in time to May when they asked me "Can we put your Momma on a ventilator?" I would have pushed my past self out of the way and said "G'damned NO!"</p>

        <p>Felt all alone in knowing that something after the initial week or so it hit home here that things were not what we were being told they were. I was outside doing my thing the entire time the hysterics began and still am doing the same things. Throughout the entire Summer I been just about everywhere in my corner of the state. You just can't find anyone sick with anything more than the common cold at most now and then. That was when I knew that we were in some deep shit for falling for what happened and not pushing back against it. This is not a pandemic, this is all being planned. Nothing about the narrative makes any sense and instead of getting back to normal and resuming life it gets worse and more disturbingly tyrannical as time goes on. nothing new going on everywhere around me regarding more or less people being sick, I couldn't tell you a difference between this year and any other there. I know very little awake to what is happening even though it is now being shoved down out throats every day we go out in public. Nothing about it makes any sense and the longer it goes the more absurd the control and orders get. This isn't about a virus, this what happens when a humiliation ritual and a plan to reshape all of humanity for the worst to everyone have a baby.</p>
