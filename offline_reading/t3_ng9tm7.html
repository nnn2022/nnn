        <p>This is a mind-blowing article on its own. But if you read until the end you’ll find a surprise plot-twist that’s as shocking as it is hilarious.</p>
<p>So at long last, the government's scientists finally admitted what everybody with an ounce of conscience was worrying about:</p>
<p>“The use of fear to control behavior in the Covid crisis was totalitarian”</p>
<p>According to the article, SAGE regrets the unethical methods and apologizes for using fear and hysteria to manipulate behavior and terrify the public.</p>
<p>They admit that the ministers lied “in order to increase the perceived level of personal threat from Covid-19”.</p>
<p>In other words, lying to manipulate the perception and make the virus seem far more dangerous than it actually was.</p>
<p>And as you keep reading, it sounds as if they are truly regretting fueling the mass hysteria.</p>
<p>Here are few quotes from several SAGE members to give an example:</p>
<p>"Clearly, using fear as a means of control is not ethical. Using fear smacks of totalitarianism. It’s not an ethical stance for any modern government."</p>
<p>“There were discussions about fear being needed to encourage compliance, and decisions were made about how to ramp up the fear. The way we have used fear is dystopian."</p>
<p>“The use of fear has definitely been ethically questionable. It’s been like a weird experiment”</p>
<p>Another SAGE psychologist defined the Covid experiment with this quote “You could call it psychology ‘mind control’”</p>
<p>These are several different members by the way, and as you keep reading it seems like they’re all experiencing profound remorse.</p>
<p>“Another member of SAGE said they were stunned by ‘the weaponization of behavioural psychology’  during the pandemic... Psychologists didn’t seem to notice when it stopped being altruistic and became manipulative. They have too much power and it intoxicates them.”</p>
<p>And according to the article, yet another member confessed that the goal was using the pandemic excuse to "grab power and drive through things that wouldn’t happen otherwise."</p>
<p>He closes by saying:</p>
<p>“We have to be very careful about the authoritarianism that is creeping in.”</p>
<p>Note that these are the very people who sold the pandemic.</p>
<p>And it’s shocking to see them all of the sudden admitting the real reasons behind creating the mass-hysteria in the first place.</p>
<p>Though it’s more shocking to hear politicians openly admitting it as well.</p>
<p>For instance, when asked if Covid policy is playing into the roots of totalitarianism, MP Steve Baker answered “Of course!”.</p>
<p>Baker also questions the decision to “terrify the public just to get compliance with rules”.</p>
<p>So yeah, everybody knew what this was all about: Fear.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the Telegraph, a group of SAGE scientists has been warning that a “Campaign of Fear is being deliberately carried out to control behaviour, crossing a barrier into seriously unethical practice by the Government’s behavioural scientists.”</p>
<p>These are exact quotes. But the last one almost sounds like a joke.</p>
<p>Apparently despite the massive mental health crisis that the lockdowns brought upon the world, one SAGE scientist had this to say:</p>
<p>“Psychology has had a really good epidemic, actually.”</p>
<p>Get it? They think that the real epidemic was the mass-hysteria. 😂The Karen-19 virus. They’re openly mocking us and we’re playing their game.</p>
<p>Here’s the craziest part of it all:</p>
<p>It’s crazy to hear behavioral scientists admitting that the mass hysteria was fueled on purpose.</p>
<p>Doing so while using words like “Mind-control”, “Using fear to manipulate behavior”, “Fear Campaigns”...etc.</p>
<p>Crazier is to realize that health played no part in that psychological experiment, but the goal was always “Totalitarianism”, “Dystopia”, “Authoritarianism”... etc.</p>
<p>These are the words you’d expect your common neighbour to use. Not the actual psychologists running the ‘Campaign of Fear’ as they themselves call it.</p>
<p>Now ready for the plot-twist?</p>
<p>A few days after the cries of regret, the Mea Culpa and the crocodile tears… SAGE allegedly received a huge ‘donation’ from you know who, and immediately did the twist again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spiked-online.com/.../18/sage-cannot-be-serious/">https://www.spiked-online.com/.../18/sage-cannot-be-serious/</a></p>
<p>The very same people who just cried about the totalitarian aspect of lockdowns and the societies destroyed by fear… Suddenly changed their stance and released a “Consensus Statement” issuing the very exaggerated threats they just admitted lying about:</p>
<p>“The end is nigh, get ready to die”… You know the drill.</p>
<p>What changed? A few millions.</p>
<p>I guess conscience has a price after all 😉</p>
