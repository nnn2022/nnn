        <p>Your ability to pronounce a word is not relevant to the effectiveness of medical ingredients. Those two things aren't related. </p>
<p>It'd be like saying "I can't spin on my head, so clearly I know how to fly a plane." How are the two related at all?</p>

        <p>It's not meant to be taken literally, "<em>can't even pronounce a single ingredient</em>" typically refers to common knowledge about the content. For example would you drink a cup of coffee if you knew it had transmission oil in it? </p>
<p>Would you ask how much and trust whatever the authority say, even if they admit that there is transmission oil in your coffee, "<em>but not enough to harm you</em>" according to them.</p>
<p>Would you ask why there is transmission oil in your coffee and refuse to drink until you get a reasonable answer?</p>
<p>Or would you simply pour it out and accept whatever consequence that might lead to? This seems most reasonable if you know how harmful it is to drink transmission oil and what would happen to your body if you get it in you.</p>

        <p>It is a moot point because transmission oil in your coffee is not relative to medical ingredients. </p>
<p>You eat too much food and you get fat. You drink too much water and you get bloated. Eat too many sesame seed bagels in a row and you'll test positive for opium on your drug test. Smoking weed is perfectly fine but if you do that too much it'll fuck you over too. Everything is harmful if you take it into your body wrong. Medical ingredients are the same. </p>
<p>Do you take aspirin when you get a headache? Take a swig of cough syrup when you have a cold? Do you know every ingredient that's in your favorite snack food? Do you know how many toxic, poisonous chemicals the last vegetable you ate spent most of it's life marinating in? If you chugged some weed killer you might die but you seem to be just fine eating strawberries sprayed with the same shit. </p>
<p>You can look up the vaccine ingredients yourself if you want. Research what makes each ingredient useful, what makes it harmful, and how they take shit that's poisonous and make it useful for us. It's actually fascinating.</p>
