    <strong>The Three Greatest Weaknesses Of Dictators</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>Those who stand with masses in solidarity, because popularity in solidarity disrupts their balance of power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who stand with God and the power of the Catholic Church, because the Catholic Church backs solidarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criticism from Governments that support solidairty, because human rights sanctions can turn into war. A Dictator will not harm anyone unless they are prepared for an external invasion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These were the same three tools the people used to conquer Communism in Poland over 70 years ago, and they can be used again today. This is why the government is seperating us and attacking the churches.They want to break our spirits, and for us to bow down to them as our new masters. </p>
<p>It's time for people to wake up and take our world back. Never take a knee to anyone other than God. When we stand together we are unbreakable.</p></p>

        <p>My family is religious, but I am not, I fell away from the church for a number of reasons, but lately, my brother's new church has been interesting me in ways that make me feel less judged for being of a skeptical mind (I used to call myself athiest, but now consider myself more agnostic - in the sense that, no one really knows or can know the truth). If theres anything that has become true in my life is that I have sorely missed the community that church provides, so as someone who is normally aversive of the teachings of religion I would say that absolutely community is an important thing. Not saying to go to a church you can't get behind, but this OP is making an important point, and this is coming from someone like me.</p>

        <p>Not all churches are the same - I've come a long way around and have started to realize that above all else the main point of OP is around community - and no matter what you believe, it is demonstrable that the world today wants each of us in a lonely cubicle listening to our little light in our hands on what to think, what to see, what to taste. </p>
<p>Its a problem today:</p>
<p>&rt;A person who thinks all the time</p>
<p>&rt;Has nothing to think about except thoughts</p>
<p>&rt;So, he loses touch with reality</p>
<p>&rt;And lives in a world of illusions</p>
<p>&rt;By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull</p>
<p>&rt;Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words</p>
<p>&rt;Of reckoning and calculating</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not saying that thinking is bad</p>
<p>&rt;Like everything else, It's useful in moderation</p>
<p>&rt;A good servant, but a bad master</p>
<p>&rt;And all so-called civilized peoples</p>
<p>&rt;Have increasingly become crazy and self-destructive</p>
<p>&rt;Because, through excessive thinking</p>
<p>&rt;They have lost touch with reality</p>
<p>&rt;That's to say</p>
<p>&rt;We confuse signs</p>
<p>&rt;With the real world</p>
<p>&rt;This is the beginning of meditation...</p>
<p>&rt;Most of us would have</p>
<p>&rt;Rather money than tangible wealth</p>
<p>&rt;And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed</p>
<p>&rt;And to read about it the next day in the newspaper</p>
<p>&rt;Is oddly more fun for us than the original event</p>
<p>&rt;This is a disaster!</p>
<p>&rt;For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs</p>
<p>&rt;We are destroying nature</p>
<p>&rt;We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses</p>
<p>&rt;Time to wake up</p>
<p>&rt;What is reality? Obviously no one can say</p>
<p>&rt;Because it isn't words</p>
<p>&rt;It isn't material, that's just an idea</p>
<p>&rt;Reality IS.</p>
<p>&rt;The point cannot be explained in words</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not trying to put you down</p>
<p>&rt;It's an expression of you as you are</p>
<p>&rt;One must live</p>
<p>&rt;We need to survive, to go on</p>
<p>&rt;We must go on</p>
<p>&rt;-- Alan Watts</p>

        <p>I never really saw it that way, my interpretation has really been about disconnecting and just experiencing, living, looking around you, connecting with others. Sorry if you interpreted or felt that way about it, I mean Alan Watts was really someone who popularized a lot of meditative philosophies so take from that what you will, its just been something that's been resonating with me lately</p>

        <p>Fair points - to be honest I haven't really looked that deeply into it before, and actually because it has been pulling on me (it came from a song), I think I will start, but like I was saying, it just resonated with me because of the way I see people so sucked into the online world, completely ignoring the world around them. I see now that perhaps I was entering into a philosophical debate here that I am actually sorely prepared for, I still stand by my conviction around needing more community irl - but if you can forgive my naivety here, I'm just not prepared to argue for or against alan watts, just found it compelling a bit (again - around being sucked into online while neglecting our real life communities)</p>
