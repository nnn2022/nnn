    <strong>My sister’s marriage</strong>
    <p><p>I’m enraged right now. My sister married a great guy last year. I really like him, but while he’s not a doomer he is pretty much towing the mainstream line. He’s reasonably skeptical of the vaccine, and my sister and I have been working on him to get him to see reason over the past year.</p>
<p><em>His</em> sister, on the other hand, is a nurse, and a doomer to the max. She made everyone where masks in their homes during Christmas, and she makes her parents wear a mask in their own house when any family comes to visit and has them living in fear. She’s been having meltdowns over my sister and her husband not taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>Well, it’s come out that she blames my sister for all this and is literally going behind my sister’s back and trying to get her brother to divorce my sister over this. Nurse is completely full of the koolaid and my sister knows it’s only a matter of time before she reports them to authorities over petty stuff. </p>
<p>Long story short, my BIL is caught in the middle of this and believes his nurse sister on some of this crap, and he’s not definitively taking her side or my sister’s side. I’m scared and angry for my sister. She and I don’t have a relationship with our own family because of an abusive upbringing, and she took a big risk moving 500 miles from our hometown to marry this guy, and now she’s feeling very isolated among his family and in their town.  Things are escalating and I’m starting to see propaganda in action tearing families apart. </p>
<p>There’s nothing I can do, either.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I keep my mouth shut with almost all of it. I haven’t even spoken to this woman. I basically just share a few red pilling stats or articles or memes with my sister a few times a week.</p>

        <p>Yeah. Unfortunately, this is between your sister and her husband. Obviously, he should take the side of the woman he chose to spend his life with. Of course, I've seen many, many, <strong>many</strong> cases where manipulative relatives tear marriages apart, and people side with their relatives over their spouses, with the logic being "Well, they're my blood family, right? They probably care about me more than some unrelated loser I married". It sucks, but it's just another stupid thing that Covid is exacerbating, though people in general can be really stupid about this sort of thing.</p>

        <p>I totally understand. That’s why this post is a rant. Like I said, there’s nothing I can do. It’s just infuriating to watch this witch manipulate her family.</p>

        <p>I mean, I agree in principle, but it’s more complicated when it’s your actual family. I do genuinely like the guy, he’s just got clouded judgment at the moment. There’s only so much sense I can speak to him</p>

        <p>Trying to break up other people's marriages is what we commonly refer to as a red flag behavior. </p>
<p>I guess one way or another this one will resolve itself. Hopefully he really is a great guy and establishes and enforces some boundaries. </p>
<p>Shit like this is totally alien to me. I grew up in a midwest Catholic family where we don't really talk to each other or ask each other questions about...things? Like when I eventually marry someone, my siblings will probably learn her name, maybe where she works, and that's about it. I could marry a Scientologist and it would probably take a good six years to come up in conversation. </p>
<p>I don't understand these families where everyone fucks around with everyone else's private lives.</p>

        <p>Eh, I mean that’s not exactly the right tactic in this scenario, and also I don’t completely blame him for the situation (even though I think he’s being weak minded). But please don’t advocate violence on this post</p>
