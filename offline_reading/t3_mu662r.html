    <strong>I have hope.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://amp.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/msxkkl/23_year_old_who_lives_with_his_mom_wants_to_rat/">This</a> post made me feel depressed about the direction of the world, so I thought I’d share some of the good I’ve seen recently. Hopefully it will cheer us both up.</p>
<p>I grew up in Miami, Florida and most of my family still lives there. When the “pandemic” started, my Abuela was terrified. She made us all face shields, gave us masks, and she wouldn’t leave her house. We wanted to visit her and she’d refuse and get angry at us. Now she’s aware of the data and the risk involved with the Covid vaccine. She’s no longer acting like a schizophrenic, and my sister says she visits her all the time again. My family occasionally sends photos of them eating out at restaurants and people dancing to Cuban music without masks. </p>
<p>I currently live in a small town in Arizona. Since day one, people here have opposed lockdowns and masks. There were town meetings at parks without people wearing masks, and they’d organize protests against the businesses that required you to wear one. Ik it’s hard to believe, but seriously, around 50 percent of people refuse to wear a mask, if not more. Theres one major hospital in town, on the main road, and you can usually see a few people holding up signs that say “vaccines contain poison”. It’s beautiful what people can accomplish when they communicate, rather than let fear overcome them.</p>
<p>I’m moving from Arizona in a month and won’t be seeing my family for a long while. We wanted to go on a trip together before I left, so we recently went on a family vacation to Kauai, Hawaii. After the flight and hotel was booked, I found out I needed to provide a negative Covid test. Plans were already made, so fine, I reluctantly gave them the test results. After landing in Hawaii and exiting the airport, I saw signs saying that you have to wear a mask in public at all times. There’s a maximum penalty of $5,000 and a year in jail for not wearing a mask outside of your home. I was in a horrible mood, and regretted going so badly. Long story short, even with the harsh penalties for not wearing one, I saw plenty of people without masks. At the pool at our hotel, at the beaches, on sidewalks... twice I walked past police cars at stop lights and smiled (without a mask on) and they had a look of concern on their faces, but none approached me. I think even they know that law would be wrong to enforce. The most beautiful thing I saw while there was a band playing music in front of a small restaurant on the beach. Nobody playing or watching was wearing a mask, and it seemed like a sort of peaceful protest. In between songs I remember the singer saying, “thank you all for coming here to celebrate life with us.”</p>
<p>TLTR: There is hope. Not everyone is brainwashed. Lots of people are going against the new normal. Lots of people are working together to fight this. If there’s nobody doing it in your area, <strong>YOU be the one</strong>. I promise you’re not alone.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.</p></p>
