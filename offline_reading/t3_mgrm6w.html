    <strong>How to change a doomer's mind</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen this asked here and on lockdown skepticism several times, people asking how/if anyone has been able to convince a doomer to see things differently.  Here's what has worked for me:</p>
<p>First you have to understand that when you're in an active disagreement with someone, there is a near zero percent chance that you will change their mind on the spot.  The best approach, in my opinion, is to plant seeds in their mind that will grow (hopefully) and force them to change their perspective.  This is my preferred approach for literally any type of disagreement.  </p>
<p>So how do we plant seeds?  First, don't make statements, instead ask questions.   There was a nice article posted recently that showed how something like 60% of people drastically overestimate the risk involved with covid.  This is a great place to start.  Instead of accusing them of being overly paranoid about the risk, ask them what percentage of covid cases they believe require hospitalization.  You'll likely get a response that is way higher than the reality.  But instead of rubbing it in their face, break it to them lightly with something like "you know i thought so too, but recently I learned it's only 1-5%".  They'll probably just shrug and move on.  But the seed has been planted.</p>
<p>Continue with the questions.   What do you think the average age is for covid deaths?   Their answer will probably be somewhere between 60-70.  You can respond with something like "turns out it's 82.  What's interesting about that is it's actually higher than the average life expectancy."  </p>
<p>Another question:  what do you think are the odds of dying for someone your age who catches covid?   Answer here: https://i.redd.it/h24erex727q61.jpg</p>
<p>And then leave it alone.  They won't think much of it at first but when the seeds start to grow, they will likely decide to do some research on their own, and if they do change their mind you won't get any credit for it but who cares.  One less doomer you have to deal with.</p>
<p>Do NOT tell them you're a skeptic and do not take on an argumentative vibe.  The more "I'm right, you're wrong and also stupid" vibes you project the more you entrench them further in their beliefs.  Pretend like you're on their side and you're just sharing some surprising new information that you learned.</p></p>

        <p>I can think of a couple of thing you might get some pushback on that I would like to hear your thoughts on. </p>
<p>One, someone might ask for sources on your stats, do you have links to them? </p>
<p>And two, your comment about the average age of covid deaths. If you just say as you put it, "Turns out it's 82" the immediate thing I think of is that you place less value on the lives of the older generation than those of the younger. I'd be interested in how you would respond to that.</p>
